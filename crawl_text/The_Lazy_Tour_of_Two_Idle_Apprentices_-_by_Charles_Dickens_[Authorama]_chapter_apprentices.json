        "In the autumn month of September, eighteen hundred and fifty-seven,\nwherein these presents bear date, two idle apprentices, exhausted\nby the long, hot summer, and the long, hot work it had brought with\nit, ran away from their employer.  They were bound to a highly\nmeritorious lady (named Literature), of fair credit and repute,\nthough, it must be acknowledged, not quite so highly esteemed in\nthe City as she might be.  This is the more remarkable, as there is\nnothing against the respectable lady in that quarter, but quite the\ncontrary; her family having rendered eminent service to many famous\ncitizens of London.  It may be sufficient to name Sir William\nWalworth, Lord Mayor under King Richard II., at the time of Wat\nTyler’s insurrection, and Sir Richard Whittington:  which latter\ndistinguished man and magistrate was doubtless indebted to the\nlady’s family for the gift of his celebrated cat.  There is also\nstrong reason to suppose that they rang the Highgate bells for him\nwith their own hands.",
        "The misguided young men who thus shirked their duty to the mistress\nfrom whom they had received many favours, were actuated by the low\nidea of making a perfectly idle trip, in any direction.  They had\nno intention of going anywhere in particular; they wanted to see\nnothing, they wanted to know nothing, they wanted to learn nothing,\nthey wanted to do nothing.  They wanted only to be idle.  They took\nto themselves (after HOGARTH), the names of Mr. Thomas Idle and Mr.\nFrancis Goodchild; but there was not a moral pin to choose between\nthem, and they were both idle in the last degree.",
        "Between Francis and Thomas, however, there was this difference of\ncharacter:  Goodchild was laboriously idle, and would take upon\nhimself any amount of pains and labour to assure himself that he\nwas idle; in short, had no better idea of idleness than that it was\nuseless industry.  Thomas Idle, on the other hand, was an idler of\nthe unmixed Irish or Neapolitan type; a passive idler, a born-and-\nbred idler, a consistent idler, who practised what he would have\npreached if he had not been too idle to preach; a one entire and\nperfect chrysolite of idleness.",
        "The two idle apprentices found themselves, within a few hours of\ntheir escape, walking down into the North of England, that is to\nsay, Thomas was lying in a meadow, looking at the railway trains as\nthey passed over a distant viaduct - which was HIS idea of walking\ndown into the North; while Francis was walking a mile due South\nagainst time - which was HIS idea of walking down into the North.\nIn the meantime the day waned, and the milestones remained\nunconquered.",
        "’Tom,’ said Goodchild, ’the sun is getting low.  Up, and let us go\nforward!’",
        "’Nay,’ quoth Thomas Idle, ’I have not done with Annie Laurie yet.’\nAnd he proceeded with that idle but popular ballad, to the effect\nthat for the bonnie young person of that name he would ’lay him\ndoon and dee’ - equivalent, in prose, to lay him down and die.",
        "’What an ass that fellow was!’ cried Goodchild, with the bitter\nemphasis of contempt.",
        "’Which fellow?’ asked Thomas Idle.",
        "’The fellow in your song.  Lay him doon and dee!  Finely he’d show\noff before the girl by doing THAT.  A sniveller!  Why couldn’t he\nget up, and punch somebody’s head!’",
        "’Whose?’ asked Thomas Idle.",
        "’Anybody’s.  Everybody’s would be better than nobody’s!  If I fell\ninto that state of mind about a girl, do you think I’d lay me doon\nand dee?  No, sir,’ proceeded Goodchild, with a disparaging\nassumption of the Scottish accent, ’I’d get me oop and peetch into\nsomebody.  Wouldn’t you?’",
        "’I wouldn’t have anything to do with her,’ yawned Thomas Idle.\n’Why should I take the trouble?’",
        "’It’s no trouble, Tom, to fall in love,’ said Goodchild, shaking\nhis head.",
        "’It’s trouble enough to fall out of it, once you’re in it,’\nretorted Tom.  ’So I keep out of it altogether.  It would be better\nfor you, if you did the same.’",
        "Mr. Goodchild, who is always in love with somebody, and not\nunfrequently with several objects at once, made no reply.  He\nheaved a sigh of the kind which is termed by the lower orders ’a\nbellowser,’ and then, heaving Mr. Idle on his feet (who was not\nhalf so heavy as the sigh), urged him northward.",
        "These two had sent their personal baggage on by train:  only\nretaining each a knapsack.  Idle now applied himself to constantly\nregretting the train, to tracking it through the intricacies of\nBradshaw’s Guide, and finding out where it is now - and where now -\nand where now - and to asking what was the use of walking, when you\ncould ride at such a pace as that.  Was it to see the country?  If\nthat was the object, look at it out of the carriage windows.  There\nwas a great deal more of it to be seen there than here.  Besides,\nwho wanted to see the country?  Nobody.  And again, whoever did\nwalk?  Nobody.  Fellows set off to walk, but they never did it.\nThey came back and said they did, but they didn’t.  Then why should\nhe walk?  He wouldn’t walk.  He swore it by this milestone!",
        "It was the fifth from London, so far had they penetrated into the\nNorth.  Submitting to the powerful chain of argument, Goodchild\nproposed a return to the Metropolis, and a falling back upon Euston\nSquare Terminus.  Thomas assented with alacrity, and so they walked\ndown into the North by the next morning’s express, and carried\ntheir knapsacks in the luggage-van.",
        "It was like all other expresses, as every express is and must be.\nIt bore through the harvest country a smell like a large washing-\nday, and a sharp issue of steam as from a huge brazen tea-urn.  The\ngreatest power in nature and art combined, it yet glided over\ndangerous heights in the sight of people looking up from fields and\nroads, as smoothly and unreally as a light miniature plaything.\nNow, the engine shrieked in hysterics of such intensity, that it\nseemed desirable that the men who had her in charge should hold her\nfeet, slap her hands, and bring her to; now, burrowed into tunnels\nwith a stubborn and undemonstrative energy so confusing that the\ntrain seemed to be flying back into leagues of darkness.  Here,\nwere station after station, swallowed up by the express without\nstopping; here, stations where it fired itself in like a volley of\ncannon-balls, swooped away four country-people with nosegays, and\nthree men of business with portmanteaus, and fired itself off\nagain, bang, bang, bang!  At long intervals were uncomfortable\nrefreshment-rooms, made more uncomfortable by the scorn of Beauty\ntowards Beast, the public (but to whom she never relented, as\nBeauty did in the story, towards the other Beast), and where\nsensitive stomachs were fed, with a contemptuous sharpness\noccasioning indigestion.  Here, again, were stations with nothing\ngoing but a bell, and wonderful wooden razors set aloft on great\nposts, shaving the air.  In these fields, the horses, sheep, and\ncattle were well used to the thundering meteor, and didn’t mind; in\nthose, they were all set scampering together, and a herd of pigs\nscoured after them.  The pastoral country darkened, became coaly,\nbecame smoky, became infernal, got better, got worse, improved\nagain, grew rugged, turned romantic; was a wood, a stream, a chain\nof hills, a gorge, a moor, a cathedral town, a fortified place, a\nwaste.  Now, miserable black dwellings, a black canal, and sick\nblack towers of chimneys; now, a trim garden, where the flowers\nwere bright and fair; now, a wilderness of hideous altars all a-\nblaze; now, the water meadows with their fairy rings; now, the\nmangy patch of unlet building ground outside the stagnant town,\nwith the larger ring where the Circus was last week.  The\ntemperature changed, the dialect changed, the people changed, faces\ngot sharper, manner got shorter, eyes got shrewder and harder; yet\nall so quickly, that the spruce guard in the London uniform and\nsilver lace, had not yet rumpled his shirt-collar, delivered half\nthe dispatches in his shiny little pouch, or read his newspaper.",
        "Carlisle!  Idle and Goodchild had got to Carlisle.  It looked\ncongenially and delightfully idle.  Something in the way of public\namusement had happened last month, and something else was going to\nhappen before Christmas; and, in the meantime there was a lecture\non India for those who liked it - which Idle and Goodchild did not.\nLikewise, by those who liked them, there were impressions to be\nbought of all the vapid prints, going and gone, and of nearly all\nthe vapid books.  For those who wanted to put anything in\nmissionary boxes, here were the boxes.  For those who wanted the\nReverend Mr. Podgers (artist’s proofs, thirty shillings), here was\nMr. Podgers to any amount.  Not less gracious and abundant, Mr.\nCodgers also of the vineyard, but opposed to Mr. Podgers, brotherly\ntooth and nail.  Here, were guide-books to the neighbouring\nantiquities, and eke the Lake country, in several dry and husky\nsorts; here, many physically and morally impossible heads of both\nsexes, for young ladies to copy, in the exercise of the art of\ndrawing; here, further, a large impression of MR. SPURGEON, solid\nas to the flesh, not to say even something gross.  The working\nyoung men of Carlisle were drawn up, with their hands in their\npockets, across the pavements, four and six abreast, and appeared\n(much to the satisfaction of Mr. Idle) to have nothing else to do.\nThe working and growing young women of Carlisle, from the age of\ntwelve upwards, promenaded the streets in the cool of the evening,\nand rallied the said young men.  Sometimes the young men rallied\nthe young women, as in the case of a group gathered round an\naccordion-player, from among whom a young man advanced behind a\nyoung woman for whom he appeared to have a tenderness, and hinted\nto her that he was there and playful, by giving her (he wore clogs)\na kick.",
        "On market morning, Carlisle woke up amazingly, and became (to the\ntwo Idle Apprentices) disagreeably and reproachfully busy.  There\nwere its cattle market, its sheep market, and its pig market down\nby the river, with raw-boned and shock-headed Rob Roys hiding their\nLowland dresses beneath heavy plaids, prowling in and out among the\nanimals, and flavouring the air with fumes of whiskey.  There was\nits corn market down the main street, with hum of chaffering over\nopen sacks.  There was its general market in the street too, with\nheather brooms on which the purple flower still flourished, and\nheather baskets primitive and fresh to behold.  With women trying\non clogs and caps at open stalls, and ’Bible stalls’ adjoining.\nWith ’Doctor Mantle’s Dispensary for the cure of all Human Maladies\nand no charge for advice,’ and with Doctor Mantle’s ’Laboratory of\nMedical, Chemical, and Botanical Science’ - both healing\ninstitutions established on one pair of trestles, one board, and\none sun-blind.  With the renowned phrenologist from London, begging\nto be favoured (at sixpence each) with the company of clients of\nboth sexes, to whom, on examination of their heads, he would make\nrevelations ’enabling him or her to know themselves.’  Through all\nthese bargains and blessings, the recruiting-sergeant watchfully\nelbowed his way, a thread of War in the peaceful skein.  Likewise\non the walls were printed hints that the Oxford Blues might not be\nindisposed to hear of a few fine active young men; and that whereas\nthe standard of that distinguished corps is full six feet, ’growing\nlads of five feet eleven’ need not absolutely despair of being\naccepted.",
        "Scenting the morning air more pleasantly than the buried majesty of\nDenmark did, Messrs. Idle and Goodchild rode away from Carlisle at\neight o’clock one forenoon, bound for the village of Hesket,\nNewmarket, some fourteen miles distant.  Goodchild (who had already\nbegun to doubt whether he was idle:  as his way always is when he\nhas nothing to do) had read of a certain black old Cumberland hill\nor mountain, called Carrock, or Carrock Fell; and had arrived at\nthe conclusion that it would be the culminating triumph of Idleness\nto ascend the same.  Thomas Idle, dwelling on the pains inseparable\nfrom that achievement, had expressed the strongest doubts of the\nexpediency, and even of the sanity, of the enterprise; but\nGoodchild had carried his point, and they rode away.",
        "Up hill and down hill, and twisting to the right, and twisting to\nthe left, and with old Skiddaw (who has vaunted himself a great\ndeal more than his merits deserve; but that is rather the way of\nthe Lake country), dodging the apprentices in a picturesque and\npleasant manner.  Good, weather-proof, warm, pleasant houses, well\nwhite-limed, scantily dotting the road.  Clean children coming out\nto look, carrying other clean children as big as themselves.\nHarvest still lying out and much rained upon; here and there,\nharvest still unreaped.  Well-cultivated gardens attached to the\ncottages, with plenty of produce forced out of their hard soil.\nLonely nooks, and wild; but people can be born, and married, and\nburied in such nooks, and can live and love, and be loved, there as\nelsewhere, thank God! (Mr. Goodchild’s remark.)  By-and-by, the\nvillage.  Black, coarse-stoned, rough-windowed houses; some with\nouter staircases, like Swiss houses; a sinuous and stony gutter\nwinding up hill and round the corner, by way of street.  All the\nchildren running out directly.  Women pausing in washing, to peep\nfrom doorways and very little windows.  Such were the observations\nof Messrs. Idle and Goodchild, as their conveyance stopped at the\nvillage shoemaker’s.  Old Carrock gloomed down upon it all in a\nvery ill-tempered state; and rain was beginning.",
        "The village shoemaker declined to have anything to do with Carrock.\nNo visitors went up Carrock.  No visitors came there at all.  Aa’\nthe world ganged awa’ yon.  The driver appealed to the Innkeeper.\nThe Innkeeper had two men working in the fields, and one of them\nshould be called in, to go up Carrock as guide.  Messrs. Idle and\nGoodchild, highly approving, entered the Innkeeper’s house, to\ndrink whiskey and eat oatcake.",
        "The Innkeeper was not idle enough - was not idle at all, which was\na great fault in him - but was a fine specimen of a north-country\nman, or any kind of man.  He had a ruddy cheek, a bright eye, a\nwell-knit frame, an immense hand, a cheery, outspeaking voice, and\na straight, bright, broad look.  He had a drawing-room, too,\nupstairs, which was worth a visit to the Cumberland Fells.  (This\nwas Mr. Francis Goodchild’s opinion, in which Mr. Thomas Idle did\nnot concur.)",
        "The ceiling of this drawing-room was so crossed and recrossed by\nbeams of unequal lengths, radiating from a centre, in a corner,\nthat it looked like a broken star-fish.  The room was comfortably\nand solidly furnished with good mahogany and horsehair.  It had a\nsnug fireside, and a couple of well-curtained windows, looking out\nupon the wild country behind the house.  What it most developed\nwas, an unexpected taste for little ornaments and nick-nacks, of\nwhich it contained a most surprising number.  They were not very\nvarious, consisting in great part of waxen babies with their limbs\nmore or less mutilated, appealing on one leg to the parental\naffections from under little cupping glasses; but, Uncle Tom was\nthere, in crockery, receiving theological instructions from Miss\nEva, who grew out of his side like a wen, in an exceedingly rough\nstate of profile propagandism.  Engravings of Mr. Hunt’s country\nboy, before and after his pie, were on the wall, divided by a\nhighly-coloured nautical piece, the subject of which had all her\ncolours (and more) flying, and was making great way through a sea\nof a regular pattern, like a lady’s collar.  A benevolent, elderly\ngentleman of the last century, with a powdered head, kept guard, in\noil and varnish, over a most perplexing piece of furniture on a\ntable; in appearance between a driving seat and an angular knife-\nbox, but, when opened, a musical instrument of tinkling wires,\nexactly like David’s harp packed for travelling.  Everything became\na nick-nack in this curious room.  The copper tea-kettle, burnished\nup to the highest point of glory, took his station on a stand of\nhis own at the greatest possible distance from the fireplace, and\nsaid:  ’By your leave, not a kettle, but a bijou.’  The\nStaffordshire-ware butter-dish with the cover on, got upon a little\nround occasional table in a window, with a worked top, and\nannounced itself to the two chairs accidentally placed there, as an\naid to polite conversation, a graceful trifle in china to be\nchatted over by callers, as they airily trifled away the visiting\nmoments of a butterfly existence, in that rugged old village on the\nCumberland Fells.  The very footstool could not keep the floor, but\ngot upon a sofa, and there-from proclaimed itself, in high relief\nof white and liver-coloured wool, a favourite spaniel coiled up for\nrepose.  Though, truly, in spite of its bright glass eyes, the\nspaniel was the least successful assumption in the collection:\nbeing perfectly flat, and dismally suggestive of a recent mistake\nin sitting down on the part of some corpulent member of the family.",
        "There were books, too, in this room; books on the table, books on\nthe chimney-piece, books in an open press in the corner.  Fielding\nwas there, and Smollett was there, and Steele and Addison were\nthere, in dispersed volumes; and there were tales of those who go\ndown to the sea in ships, for windy nights; and there was really a\nchoice of good books for rainy days or fine.  It was so very\npleasant to see these things in such a lonesome by-place - so very\nagreeable to find these evidences of a taste, however homely, that\nwent beyond the beautiful cleanliness and trimness of the house -\nso fanciful to imagine what a wonder a room must be to the little\nchildren born in the gloomy village - what grand impressions of it\nthose of them who became wanderers over the earth would carry away;\nand how, at distant ends of the world, some old voyagers would die,\ncherishing the belief that the finest apartment known to men was\nonce in the Hesket-Newmarket Inn, in rare old Cumberland - it was\nsuch a charmingly lazy pursuit to entertain these rambling thoughts\nover the choice oatcake and the genial whiskey, that Mr. Idle and\nMr. Goodchild never asked themselves how it came to pass that the\nmen in the fields were never heard of more, how the stalwart\nlandlord replaced them without explanation, how his dog-cart came\nto be waiting at the door, and how everything was arranged without\nthe least arrangement for climbing to old Carrock’s shoulders, and\nstanding on his head.",
        "Without a word of inquiry, therefore, the Two Idle Apprentices\ndrifted out resignedly into a fine, soft, close, drowsy,\npenetrating rain; got into the landlord’s light dog-cart, and\nrattled off through the village for the foot of Carrock.  The\njourney at the outset was not remarkable.  The Cumberland road went\nup and down like all other roads; the Cumberland curs burst out\nfrom backs of cottages and barked like other curs, and the\nCumberland peasantry stared after the dog-cart amazedly, as long as\nit was in sight, like the rest of their race.  The approach to the\nfoot of the mountain resembled the approaches to the feet of most\nother mountains all over the world.  The cultivation gradually\nceased, the trees grew gradually rare, the road became gradually\nrougher, and the sides of the mountain looked gradually more and\nmore lofty, and more and more difficult to get up.  The dog-cart\nwas left at a lonely farm-house.  The landlord borrowed a large\numbrella, and, assuming in an instant the character of the most\ncheerful and adventurous of guides, led the way to the ascent.  Mr.\nGoodchild looked eagerly at the top of the mountain, and, feeling\napparently that he was now going to be very lazy indeed, shone all\nover wonderfully to the eye, under the influence of the contentment\nwithin and the moisture without.  Only in the bosom of Mr. Thomas\nIdle did Despondency now hold her gloomy state.  He kept it a\nsecret; but he would have given a very handsome sum, when the\nascent began, to have been back again at the inn.  The sides of\nCarrock looked fearfully steep, and the top of Carrock was hidden\nin mist.  The rain was falling faster and faster.  The knees of Mr.\nIdle - always weak on walking excursions - shivered and shook with\nfear and damp.  The wet was already penetrating through the young\nman’s outer coat to a brand-new shooting-jacket, for which he had\nreluctantly paid the large sum of two guineas on leaving town; he\nhad no stimulating refreshment about him but a small packet of\nclammy gingerbread nuts; he had nobody to give him an arm, nobody\nto push him gently behind, nobody to pull him up tenderly in front,\nnobody to speak to who really felt the difficulties of the ascent,\nthe dampness of the rain, the denseness of the mist, and the\nunutterable folly of climbing, undriven, up any steep place in the\nworld, when there is level ground within reach to walk on instead.\nWas it for this that Thomas had left London?  London, where there\nare nice short walks in level public gardens, with benches of\nrepose set up at convenient distances for weary travellers -\nLondon, where rugged stone is humanely pounded into little lumps\nfor the road, and intelligently shaped into smooth slabs for the\npavement!  No! it was not for the laborious ascent of the crags of\nCarrock that Idle had left his native city, and travelled to\nCumberland.  Never did he feel more disastrously convinced that he\nhad committed a very grave error in judgment than when he found\nhimself standing in the rain at the bottom of a steep mountain, and\nknew that the responsibility rested on his weak shoulders of\nactually getting to the top of it.",
        "The honest landlord went first, the beaming Goodchild followed, the\nmournful Idle brought up the rear.  From time to time, the two\nforemost members of the expedition changed places in the order of\nmarch; but the rearguard never altered his position.  Up the\nmountain or down the mountain, in the water or out of it, over the\nrocks, through the bogs, skirting the heather, Mr. Thomas Idle was\nalways the last, and was always the man who had to be looked after\nand waited for.  At first the ascent was delusively easy, the sides\nof the mountain sloped gradually, and the material of which they\nwere composed was a soft spongy turf, very tender and pleasant to\nwalk upon.  After a hundred yards or so, however, the verdant scene\nand the easy slope disappeared, and the rocks began.  Not noble,\nmassive rocks, standing upright, keeping a certain regularity in\ntheir positions, and possessing, now and then, flat tops to sit\nupon, but little irritating, comfortless rocks, littered about\nanyhow, by Nature; treacherous, disheartening rocks of all sorts of\nsmall shapes and small sizes, bruisers of tender toes and trippers-\nup of wavering feet.  When these impediments were passed, heather\nand slough followed.  Here the steepness of the ascent was slightly\nmitigated; and here the exploring party of three turned round to\nlook at the view below them.  The scene of the moorland and the\nfields was like a feeble water-colour drawing half sponged out.\nThe mist was darkening, the rain was thickening, the trees were\ndotted about like spots of faint shadow, the division-lines which\nmapped out the fields were all getting blurred together, and the\nlonely farm-house where the dog-cart had been left, loomed spectral\nin the grey light like the last human dwelling at the end of the\nhabitable world.  Was this a sight worth climbing to see?  Surely -\nsurely not!",
        "Up again - for the top of Carrock is not reached yet.  The land-\nlord, just as good-tempered and obliging as he was at the bottom of\nthe mountain.  Mr. Goodchild brighter in the eyes and rosier in the\nface than ever; full of cheerful remarks and apt quotations; and\nwalking with a springiness of step wonderful to behold.  Mr. Idle,\nfarther and farther in the rear, with the water squeaking in the\ntoes of his boots, with his two-guinea shooting-jacket clinging\ndamply to his aching sides, with his overcoat so full of rain, and\nstanding out so pyramidically stiff, in consequence, from his\nshoulders downwards, that he felt as if he was walking in a\ngigantic extinguisher - the despairing spirit within him\nrepresenting but too aptly the candle that had just been put out.\nUp and up and up again, till a ridge is reached and the outer edge\nof the mist on the summit of Carrock is darkly and drizzingly near.\nIs this the top?  No, nothing like the top.  It is an aggravating\npeculiarity of all mountains, that, although they have only one top\nwhen they are seen (as they ought always to be seen) from below,\nthey turn out to have a perfect eruption of false tops whenever the\ntraveller is sufficiently ill-advised to go out of his way for the\npurpose of ascending them.  Carrock is but a trumpery little\nmountain of fifteen hundred feet, and it presumes to have false\ntops, and even precipices, as if it were Mont Blanc.  No matter;\nGoodchild enjoys it, and will go on; and Idle, who is afraid of\nbeing left behind by himself, must follow.  On entering the edge of\nthe mist, the landlord stops, and says he hopes that it will not\nget any thicker.  It is twenty years since he last ascended\nCarrock, and it is barely possible, if the mist increases, that the\nparty may be lost on the mountain.  Goodchild hears this dreadful\nintimation, and is not in the least impressed by it.  He marches\nfor the top that is never to be found, as if he was the Wandering\nJew, bound to go on for ever, in defiance of everything.  The\nlandlord faithfully accompanies him.  The two, to the dim eye of\nIdle, far below, look in the exaggerative mist, like a pair of\nfriendly giants, mounting the steps of some invisible castle\ntogether.  Up and up, and then down a little, and then up, and then\nalong a strip of level ground, and then up again.  The wind, a wind\nunknown in the happy valley, blows keen and strong; the rain-mist\ngets impenetrable; a dreary little cairn of stones appears.  The\nlandlord adds one to the heap, first walking all round the cairn as\nif he were about to perform an incantation, then dropping the stone\non to the top of the heap with the gesture of a magician adding an\ningredient to a cauldron in full bubble.  Goodchild sits down by\nthe cairn as if it was his study-table at home; Idle, drenched and\npanting, stands up with his back to the wind, ascertains distinctly\nthat this is the top at last, looks round with all the little\ncuriosity that is left in him, and gets, in return, a magnificent\nview of - Nothing!",
        "The effect of this sublime spectacle on the minds of the exploring\nparty is a little injured by the nature of the direct conclusion to\nwhich the sight of it points - the said conclusion being that the\nmountain mist has actually gathered round them, as the landlord\nfeared it would.  It now becomes imperatively necessary to settle\nthe exact situation of the farm-house in the valley at which the\ndog-cart has been left, before the travellers attempt to descend.\nWhile the landlord is endeavouring to make this discovery in his\nown way, Mr. Goodchild plunges his hand under his wet coat, draws\nout a little red morocco-case, opens it, and displays to the view\nof his companions a neat pocket-compass.  The north is found, the\npoint at which the farm-house is situated is settled, and the\ndescent begins.  After a little downward walking, Idle (behind as\nusual) sees his fellow-travellers turn aside sharply - tries to\nfollow them - loses them in the mist - is shouted after, waited\nfor, recovered - and then finds that a halt has been ordered,\npartly on his account, partly for the purpose of again consulting\nthe compass.",
        "The point in debate is settled as before between Goodchild and the\nlandlord, and the expedition moves on, not down the mountain, but\nmarching straight forward round the slope of it.  The difficulty of\nfollowing this new route is acutely felt by Thomas Idle.  He finds\nthe hardship of walking at all greatly increased by the fatigue of\nmoving his feet straight forward along the side of a slope, when\ntheir natural tendency, at every step, is to turn off at a right\nangle, and go straight down the declivity.  Let the reader imagine\nhimself to be walking along the roof of a barn, instead of up or\ndown it, and he will have an exact idea of the pedestrian\ndifficulty in which the travellers had now involved themselves.  In\nten minutes more Idle was lost in the distance again, was shouted\nfor, waited for, recovered as before; found Goodchild repeating his\nobservation of the compass, and remonstrated warmly against the\nsideway route that his companions persisted in following.  It\nappeared to the uninstructed mind of Thomas that when three men\nwant to get to the bottom of a mountain, their business is to walk\ndown it; and he put this view of the case, not only with emphasis,\nbut even with some irritability.  He was answered from the\nscientific eminence of the compass on which his companions were\nmounted, that there was a frightful chasm somewhere near the foot\nof Carrock, called The Black Arches, into which the travellers were\nsure to march in the mist, if they risked continuing the descent\nfrom the place where they had now halted.  Idle received this\nanswer with the silent respect which was due to the commanders of\nthe expedition, and followed along the roof of the barn, or rather\nthe side of the mountain, reflecting upon the assurance which he\nreceived on starting again, that the object of the party was only\nto gain ’a certain point,’ and, this haven attained, to continue\nthe descent afterwards until the foot of Carrock was reached.\nThough quite unexceptionable as an abstract form of expression, the\nphrase ’a certain point’ has the disadvantage of sounding rather\nvaguely when it is pronounced on unknown ground, under a canopy of\nmist much thicker than a London fog.  Nevertheless, after the\ncompass, this phrase was all the clue the party had to hold by, and\nIdle clung to the extreme end of it as hopefully as he could.",
        "More sideway walking, thicker and thicker mist, all sorts of points\nreached except the ’certain point;’ third loss of Idle, third\nshouts for him, third recovery of him, third consultation of\ncompass.  Mr. Goodchild draws it tenderly from his pocket, and\nprepares to adjust it on a stone.  Something falls on the turf - it\nis the glass.  Something else drops immediately after - it is the\nneedle.  The compass is broken, and the exploring party is lost!",
        "It is the practice of the English portion of the human race to\nreceive all great disasters in dead silence.  Mr. Goodchild\nrestored the useless compass to his pocket without saying a word,\nMr. Idle looked at the landlord, and the landlord looked at Mr.\nIdle.  There was nothing for it now but to go on blindfold, and\ntrust to the chapter of chances.  Accordingly, the lost travellers\nmoved forward, still walking round the slope of the mountain, still\ndesperately resolved to avoid the Black Arches, and to succeed in\nreaching the ’certain point.’",
        "A quarter of an hour brought them to the brink of a ravine, at the\nbottom of which there flowed a muddy little stream.  Here another\nhalt was called, and another consultation took place.  The\nlandlord, still clinging pertinaciously to the idea of reaching the\n’point,’ voted for crossing the ravine, and going on round the\nslope of the mountain.  Mr. Goodchild, to the great relief of his\nfellow-traveller, took another view of the case, and backed Mr.\nIdle’s proposal to descend Carrock at once, at any hazard - the\nrather as the running stream was a sure guide to follow from the\nmountain to the valley.  Accordingly, the party descended to the\nrugged and stony banks of the stream; and here again Thomas lost\nground sadly, and fell far behind his travelling companions.  Not\nmuch more than six weeks had elapsed since he had sprained one of\nhis ankles, and he began to feel this same ankle getting rather\nweak when he found himself among the stones that were strewn about\nthe running water.  Goodchild and the landlord were getting farther\nand farther ahead of him.  He saw them cross the stream and\ndisappear round a projection on its banks.  He heard them shout the\nmoment after as a signal that they had halted and were waiting for\nhim.  Answering the shout, he mended his pace, crossed the stream\nwhere they had crossed it, and was within one step of the opposite\nbank, when his foot slipped on a wet stone, his weak ankle gave a\ntwist outwards, a hot, rending, tearing pain ran through it at the\nsame moment, and down fell the idlest of the Two Idle Apprentices,\ncrippled in an instant.",
        "The situation was now, in plain terms, one of absolute danger.\nThere lay Mr. Idle writhing with pain, there was the mist as thick\nas ever, there was the landlord as completely lost as the strangers\nwhom he was conducting, and there was the compass broken in\nGoodchild’s pocket.  To leave the wretched Thomas on unknown ground\nwas plainly impossible; and to get him to walk with a badly\nsprained ankle seemed equally out of the question.  However,\nGoodchild (brought back by his cry for help) bandaged the ankle\nwith a pocket-handkerchief, and assisted by the landlord, raised\nthe crippled Apprentice to his legs, offered him a shoulder to lean\non, and exhorted him for the sake of the whole party to try if he\ncould walk.  Thomas, assisted by the shoulder on one side, and a\nstick on the other, did try, with what pain and difficulty those\nonly can imagine who have sprained an ankle and have had to tread\non it afterwards.  At a pace adapted to the feeble hobbling of a\nnewly-lamed man, the lost party moved on, perfectly ignorant\nwhether they were on the right side of the mountain or the wrong,\nand equally uncertain how long Idle would be able to contend with\nthe pain in his ankle, before he gave in altogether and fell down\nagain, unable to stir another step.",
        "Slowly and more slowly, as the clog of crippled Thomas weighed\nheavily and more heavily on the march of the expedition, the lost\ntravellers followed the windings of the stream, till they came to a\nfaintly-marked cart-track, branching off nearly at right angles, to\nthe left.  After a little consultation it was resolved to follow\nthis dim vestige of a road in the hope that it might lead to some\nfarm or cottage, at which Idle could be left in safety.  It was now\ngetting on towards the afternoon, and it was fast becoming more\nthan doubtful whether the party, delayed in their progress as they\nnow were, might not be overtaken by the darkness before the right\nroute was found, and be condemned to pass the night on the\nmountain, without bit or drop to comfort them, in their wet\nclothes.",
        "The cart-track grew fainter and fainter, until it was washed out\naltogether by another little stream, dark, turbulent, and rapid.\nThe landlord suggested, judging by the colour of the water, that it\nmust be flowing from one of the lead mines in the neighbourhood of\nCarrock; and the travellers accordingly kept by the stream for a\nlittle while, in the hope of possibly wandering towards help in\nthat way.  After walking forward about two hundred yards, they came\nupon a mine indeed, but a mine, exhausted and abandoned; a dismal,\nruinous place, with nothing but the wreck of its works and\nbuildings left to speak for it.  Here, there were a few sheep\nfeeding.  The landlord looked at them earnestly, thought he\nrecognised the marks on them - then thought he did not - finally\ngave up the sheep in despair - and walked on just as ignorant of\nthe whereabouts of the party as ever.",
        "The march in the dark, literally as well as metaphorically in the\ndark, had now been continued for three-quarters of an hour from the\ntime when the crippled Apprentice had met with his accident.  Mr.\nIdle, with all the will to conquer the pain in his ankle, and to\nhobble on, found the power rapidly failing him, and felt that\nanother ten minutes at most would find him at the end of his last\nphysical resources.  He had just made up his mind on this point,\nand was about to communicate the dismal result of his reflections\nto his companions, when the mist suddenly brightened, and begun to\nlift straight ahead.  In another minute, the landlord, who was in\nadvance, proclaimed that he saw a tree.  Before long, other trees\nappeared - then a cottage - then a house beyond the cottage, and a\nfamiliar line of road rising behind it.  Last of all, Carrock\nitself loomed darkly into view, far away to the right hand.  The\nparty had not only got down the mountain without knowing how, but\nhad wandered away from it in the mist, without knowing why - away,\nfar down on the very moor by which they had approached the base of\nCarrock that morning.",
        "The happy lifting of the mist, and the still happier discovery that\nthe travellers had groped their way, though by a very roundabout\ndirection, to within a mile or so of the part of the valley in\nwhich the farm-house was situated, restored Mr. Idle’s sinking\nspirits and reanimated his failing strength.  While the landlord\nran off to get the dog-cart, Thomas was assisted by Goodchild to\nthe cottage which had been the first building seen when the\ndarkness brightened, and was propped up against the garden wall,\nlike an artist’s lay figure waiting to be forwarded, until the dog-\ncart should arrive from the farm-house below.  In due time - and a\nvery long time it seemed to Mr. Idle - the rattle of wheels was\nheard, and the crippled Apprentice was lifted into the seat.  As\nthe dog-cart was driven back to the inn, the landlord related an\nanecdote which he had just heard at the farm-house, of an unhappy\nman who had been lost, like his two guests and himself, on Carrock;\nwho had passed the night there alone; who had been found the next\nmorning, ’scared and starved;’ and who never went out afterwards,\nexcept on his way to the grave.  Mr. Idle heard this sad story, and\nderived at least one useful impression from it.  Bad as the pain in\nhis ankle was, he contrived to bear it patiently, for he felt\ngrateful that a worse accident had not befallen him in the wilds of\nCarrock.",
        "The dog-cart, with Mr. Thomas Idle and his ankle on the hanging\nseat behind, Mr. Francis Goodchild and the Innkeeper in front, and\nthe rain in spouts and splashes everywhere, made the best of its\nway back to the little inn; the broken moor country looking like\nmiles upon miles of Pre-Adamite sop, or the ruins of some enormous\njorum of antediluvian toast-and-water.  The trees dripped; the\neaves of the scattered cottages dripped; the barren stone walls\ndividing the land, dripped; the yelping dogs dripped; carts and\nwaggons under ill-roofed penthouses, dripped; melancholy cocks and\nhens perching on their shafts, or seeking shelter underneath them,\ndripped; Mr. Goodchild dripped; Thomas Idle dripped; the Inn-keeper\ndripped; the mare dripped; the vast curtains of mist and cloud\npassed before the shadowy forms of the hills, streamed water as\nthey were drawn across the landscape.  Down such steep pitches that\nthe mare seemed to be trotting on her head, and up such steep\npitches that she seemed to have a supplementary leg in her tail,\nthe dog-cart jolted and tilted back to the village.  It was too wet\nfor the women to look out, it was too wet even for the children to\nlook out; all the doors and windows were closed, and the only sign\nof life or motion was in the rain-punctured puddles.",
        "Whiskey and oil to Thomas Idle’s ankle, and whiskey without oil to\nFrancis Goodchild’s stomach, produced an agreeable change in the\nsystems of both; soothing Mr. Idle’s pain, which was sharp before,\nand sweetening Mr. Goodchild’s temper, which was sweet before.\nPortmanteaus being then opened and clothes changed, Mr. Goodchild,\nthrough having no change of outer garments but broadcloth and\nvelvet, suddenly became a magnificent portent in the Innkeeper’s\nhouse, a shining frontispiece to the fashions for the month, and a\nfrightful anomaly in the Cumberland village.",
        "Greatly ashamed of his splendid appearance, the conscious Goodchild\nquenched it as much as possible, in the shadow of Thomas Idle’s\nankle, and in a corner of the little covered carriage that started\nwith them for Wigton - a most desirable carriage for any country,\nexcept for its having a flat roof and no sides; which caused the\nplumps of rain accumulating on the roof to play vigorous games of\nbagatelle into the interior all the way, and to score immensely.\nIt was comfortable to see how the people coming back in open carts\nfrom Wigton market made no more of the rain than if it were\nsunshine; how the Wigton policeman taking a country walk of half-a-\ndozen miles (apparently for pleasure), in resplendent uniform,\naccepted saturation as his normal state; how clerks and\nschoolmasters in black, loitered along the road without umbrellas,\ngetting varnished at every step; how the Cumberland girls, coming\nout to look after the Cumberland cows, shook the rain from their\neyelashes and laughed it away; and how the rain continued to fall\nupon all, as it only does fall in hill countries.",
        "Wigton market was over, and its bare booths were smoking with rain\nall down the street.  Mr. Thomas Idle, melodramatically carried to\nthe inn’s first floor, and laid upon three chairs (he should have\nhad the sofa, if there had been one), Mr. Goodchild went to the\nwindow to take an observation of Wigton, and report what he saw to\nhis disabled companion.",
        "’Brother Francis, brother Francis,’ cried Thomas Idle, ’What do you\nsee from the turret?’",
        "’I see,’ said Brother Francis, ’what I hope and believe to be one\nof the most dismal places ever seen by eyes.  I see the houses with\ntheir roofs of dull black, their stained fronts, and their dark-\nrimmed windows, looking as if they were all in mourning.  As every\nlittle puff of wind comes down the street, I see a perfect train of\nrain let off along the wooden stalls in the market-place and\nexploded against me.  I see a very big gas lamp in the centre which\nI know, by a secret instinct, will not be lighted to-night.  I see\na pump, with a trivet underneath its spout whereon to stand the\nvessels that are brought to be filled with water.  I see a man come\nto pump, and he pumps very hard, but no water follows, and he\nstrolls empty away.’",
        "’Brother Francis, brother Francis,’ cried Thomas Idle, ’what more\ndo you see from the turret, besides the man and the pump, and the\ntrivet and the houses all in mourning and the rain?’",
        "’I see,’ said Brother Francis, ’one, two, three, four, five, linen-\ndrapers’ shops in front of me.  I see a linen-draper’s shop next\ndoor to the right - and there are five more linen-drapers’ shops\ndown the corner to the left.  Eleven homicidal linen-drapers’ shops\nwithin a short stone’s throw, each with its hands at the throats of\nall the rest!  Over the small first-floor of one of these linen-\ndrapers’ shops appears the wonderful inscription, BANK.’",
        "’Brother Francis, brother Francis,’ cried Thomas Idle, ’what more\ndo you see from the turret, besides the eleven homicidal linen-\ndrapers’ shops, and the wonderful inscription, “Bank,” - on the\nsmall first-floor, and the man and the pump and the trivet and the\nhouses all in mourning and the rain?’",
        "’I see,’ said Brother Francis, ’the depository for Christian\nKnowledge, and through the dark vapour I think I again make out Mr.\nSpurgeon looming heavily.  Her Majesty the Queen, God bless her,\nprinted in colours, I am sure I see.  I see the ILLUSTRATED LONDON\nNEWS of several years ago, and I see a sweetmeat shop - which the\nproprietor calls a “Salt Warehouse” - with one small female child\nin a cotton bonnet looking in on tip-toe, oblivious of rain.  And I\nsee a watchmaker’s with only three great pale watches of a dull\nmetal hanging in his window, each in a separate pane.’",
        "’Brother Francis, brother Francis,’ cried Thomas Idle, ’what more\ndo you see of Wigton, besides these objects, and the man and the\npump and the trivet and the houses all in mourning and the rain?’",
        "’I see nothing more,’ said Brother Francis, ’and there is nothing\nmore to see, except the curlpaper bill of the theatre, which was\nopened and shut last week (the manager’s family played all the\nparts), and the short, square, chinky omnibus that goes to the\nrailway, and leads too rattling a life over the stones to hold\ntogether long.  O yes!  Now, I see two men with their hands in\ntheir pockets and their backs towards me.’",
        "’Brother Francis, brother Francis,’ cried Thomas Idle, ’what do you\nmake out from the turret, of the expression of the two men with\ntheir hands in their pockets and their backs towards you?’",
        "’They are mysterious men,’ said Brother Francis, ’with inscrutable\nbacks.  They keep their backs towards me with persistency.  If one\nturns an inch in any direction, the other turns an inch in the same\ndirection, and no more.  They turn very stiffly, on a very little\npivot, in the middle of the market-place.  Their appearance is\npartly of a mining, partly of a ploughing, partly of a stable,\ncharacter.  They are looking at nothing - very hard.  Their backs\nare slouched, and their legs are curved with much standing about.\nTheir pockets are loose and dog’s-eared, on account of their hands\nbeing always in them.  They stand to be rained upon, without any\nmovement of impatience or dissatisfaction, and they keep so close\ntogether that an elbow of each jostles an elbow of the other, but\nthey never speak.  They spit at times, but speak not.  I see it\ngrowing darker and darker, and still I see them, sole visible\npopulation of the place, standing to be rained upon with their\nbacks towards me, and looking at nothing very hard.’",
        "’Brother Francis, brother Francis,’ cried Thomas Idle, ’before you\ndraw down the blind of the turret and come in to have your head\nscorched by the hot gas, see if you can, and impart to me,\nsomething of the expression of those two amazing men.’",
        "’The murky shadows,’ said Francis Goodchild, ’are gathering fast;\nand the wings of evening, and the wings of coal, are folding over\nWigton.  Still, they look at nothing very hard, with their backs\ntowards me.  Ah!  Now, they turn, and I see - ’",
        "’Brother Francis, brother Francis,’ cried Thomas Idle, ’tell me\nquickly what you see of the two men of Wigton!’",
        "’I see,’ said Francis Goodchild, ’that they have no expression at\nall.  And now the town goes to sleep, undazzled by the large\nunlighted lamp in the market-place; and let no man wake it.’",
        "At the close of the next day’s journey, Mr. Thomas Idle’s ankle\nbecame much swollen and inflamed.  There are reasons which will\npresently explain themselves for not publicly indicating the exact\ndirection in which that journey lay, or the place in which it\nended.  It was a long day’s shaking of Thomas Idle over the rough\nroads, and a long day’s getting out and going on before the horses,\nand fagging up hills, and scouring down hills, on the part of Mr.\nGoodchild, who in the fatigues of such labours congratulated\nhimself on attaining a high point of idleness.  It was at a little\ntown, still in Cumberland, that they halted for the night - a very\nlittle town, with the purple and brown moor close upon its one\nstreet; a curious little ancient market-cross set up in the midst\nof it; and the town itself looking much as if it were a collection\nof great stones piled on end by the Druids long ago, which a few\nrecluse people had since hollowed out for habitations.",
        "’Is there a doctor here?’ asked Mr. Goodchild, on his knee, of the\nmotherly landlady of the little Inn:  stopping in his examination\nof Mr. Idle’s ankle, with the aid of a candle.",
        "’Ey, my word!’ said the landlady, glancing doubtfully at the ankle\nfor herself; ’there’s Doctor Speddie.’",
        "’Is he a good Doctor?’",
        "’Ey!’ said the landlady, ’I ca’ him so.  A’ cooms efther nae doctor\nthat I ken.  Mair nor which, a’s just THE doctor heer.’",
        "’Do you think he is at home?’",
        "Her reply was, ’Gang awa’, Jock, and bring him.’",
        "Jock, a white-headed boy, who, under pretence of stirring up some\nbay salt in a basin of water for the laving of this unfortunate\nankle, had greatly enjoyed himself for the last ten minutes in\nsplashing the carpet, set off promptly.  A very few minutes had\nelapsed when he showed the Doctor in, by tumbling against the door\nbefore him and bursting it open with his head.",
        "’Gently, Jock, gently,’ said the Doctor as he advanced with a quiet\nstep.  ’Gentlemen, a good evening.  I am sorry that my presence is\nrequired here.  A slight accident, I hope?  A slip and a fall?\nYes, yes, yes.  Carrock, indeed?  Hah!  Does that pain you, sir?\nNo doubt, it does.  It is the great connecting ligament here, you\nsee, that has been badly strained.  Time and rest, sir!  They are\noften the recipe in greater cases,’ with a slight sigh, ’and often\nthe recipe in small.  I can send a lotion to relieve you, but we\nmust leave the cure to time and rest.’",
        "This he said, holding Idle’s foot on his knee between his two\nhands, as he sat over against him.  He had touched it tenderly and\nskilfully in explanation of what he said, and, when his careful\nexamination was completed, softly returned it to its former\nhorizontal position on a chair.",
        "He spoke with a little irresolution whenever he began, but\nafterwards fluently.  He was a tall, thin, large-boned, old\ngentleman, with an appearance at first sight of being hard-\nfeatured; but, at a second glance, the mild expression of his face\nand some particular touches of sweetness and patience about his\nmouth, corrected this impression and assigned his long professional\nrides, by day and night, in the bleak hill-weather, as the true\ncause of that appearance.  He stooped very little, though past\nseventy and very grey.  His dress was more like that of a clergyman\nthan a country doctor, being a plain black suit, and a plain white\nneck-kerchief tied behind like a band.  His black was the worse for\nwear, and there were darns in his coat, and his linen was a little\nfrayed at the hems and edges.  He might have been poor - it was\nlikely enough in that out-of-the-way spot - or he might have been a\nlittle self-forgetful and eccentric.  Any one could have seen\ndirectly, that he had neither wife nor child at home.  He had a\nscholarly air with him, and that kind of considerate humanity\ntowards others which claimed a gentle consideration for himself.\nMr. Goodchild made this study of him while he was examining the\nlimb, and as he laid it down.  Mr. Goodchild wishes to add that he\nconsiders it a very good likeness.",
        "It came out in the course of a little conversation, that Doctor\nSpeddie was acquainted with some friends of Thomas Idle’s, and had,\nwhen a young man, passed some years in Thomas Idle’s birthplace on\nthe other side of England.  Certain idle labours, the fruit of Mr.\nGoodchild’s apprenticeship, also happened to be well known to him.\nThe lazy travellers were thus placed on a more intimate footing\nwith the Doctor than the casual circumstances of the meeting would\nof themselves have established; and when Doctor Speddie rose to go\nhome, remarking that he would send his assistant with the lotion,\nFrancis Goodchild said that was unnecessary, for, by the Doctor’s\nleave, he would accompany him, and bring it back.  (Having done\nnothing to fatigue himself for a full quarter of an hour, Francis\nbegan to fear that he was not in a state of idleness.)",
        "Doctor Speddie politely assented to the proposition of Francis\nGoodchild, ’as it would give him the pleasure of enjoying a few\nmore minutes of Mr. Goodchild’s society than he could otherwise\nhave hoped for,’ and they went out together into the village\nstreet.  The rain had nearly ceased, the clouds had broken before a\ncool wind from the north-east, and stars were shining from the\npeaceful heights beyond them.",
        "Doctor Speddie’s house was the last house in the place.  Beyond it,\nlay the moor, all dark and lonesome.  The wind moaned in a low,\ndull, shivering manner round the little garden, like a houseless\ncreature that knew the winter was coming.  It was exceedingly wild\nand solitary.  ’Roses,’ said the Doctor, when Goodchild touched\nsome wet leaves overhanging the stone porch; ’but they get cut to\npieces.’",
        "The Doctor opened the door with a key he carried, and led the way\ninto a low but pretty ample hall with rooms on either side.  The\ndoor of one of these stood open, and the Doctor entered it, with a\nword of welcome to his guest.  It, too, was a low room, half\nsurgery and half parlour, with shelves of books and bottles against\nthe walls, which were of a very dark hue.  There was a fire in the\ngrate, the night being damp and chill.  Leaning against the\nchimney-piece looking down into it, stood the Doctor’s Assistant.",
        "A man of a most remarkable appearance.  Much older than Mr.\nGoodchild had expected, for he was at least two-and-fifty; but,\nthat was nothing.  What was startling in him was his remarkable\npaleness.  His large black eyes, his sunken cheeks, his long and\nheavy iron-grey hair, his wasted hands, and even the attenuation of\nhis figure, were at first forgotten in his extraordinary pallor.\nThere was no vestige of colour in the man.  When he turned his\nface, Francis Goodchild started as if a stone figure had looked\nround at him.",
        "’Mr. Lorn,’ said the Doctor.  ’Mr. Goodchild.’",
        "The Assistant, in a distraught way - as if he had forgotten\nsomething - as if he had forgotten everything, even to his own name\nand himself - acknowledged the visitor’s presence, and stepped\nfurther back into the shadow of the wall behind him.  But, he was\nso pale that his face stood out in relief again the dark wall, and\nreally could not be hidden so.",
        "’Mr. Goodchild’s friend has met with accident, Lorn,’ said Doctor\nSpeddie.  ’We want the lotion for a bad sprain.’",
        "A pause.",
        "’My dear fellow, you are more than usually absent to-night.  The\nlotion for a bad sprain.’",
        "’Ah! yes!  Directly.’",
        "He was evidently relieved to turn away, and to take his white face\nand his wild eyes to a table in a recess among the bottles.  But,\nthough he stood there, compounding the lotion with his back towards\nthem, Goodchild could not, for many moments, withdraw his gaze from\nthe man.  When he at length did so, he found the Doctor observing\nhim, with some trouble in his face.  ’He is absent,’ explained the\nDoctor, in a low voice.  ’Always absent.  Very absent.’",
        "’Is he ill?’",
        "’No, not ill.’",
        "’Unhappy?’",
        "’I have my suspicions that he was,’ assented the Doctor, ’once.’",
        "Francis Goodchild could not but observe that the Doctor accompanied\nthese words with a benignant and protecting glance at their\nsubject, in which there was much of the expression with which an\nattached father might have looked at a heavily afflicted son.  Yet,\nthat they were not father and son must have been plain to most\neyes.  The Assistant, on the other hand, turning presently to ask\nthe Doctor some question, looked at him with a wan smile as if he\nwere his whole reliance and sustainment in life.",
        "It was in vain for the Doctor in his easy-chair, to try to lead the\nmind of Mr. Goodchild in the opposite easy-chair, away from what\nwas before him.  Let Mr. Goodchild do what he would to follow the\nDoctor, his eyes and thoughts reverted to the Assistant.  The\nDoctor soon perceived it, and, after falling silent, and musing in\na little perplexity, said:",
        "’Lorn!’",
        "’My dear Doctor.’",
        "’Would you go to the Inn, and apply that lotion?  You will show the\nbest way of applying it, far better than Mr. Goodchild can.’",
        "’With pleasure.’",
        "The Assistant took his hat, and passed like a shadow to the door.",
        "’Lorn!’ said the Doctor, calling after him.",
        "He returned.",
        "’Mr. Goodchild will keep me company till you come home.  Don’t\nhurry.  Excuse my calling you back.’",
        "’It is not,’ said the Assistant, with his former smile, ’the first\ntime you have called me back, dear Doctor.’  With those words he\nwent away.",
        "’Mr. Goodchild,’ said Doctor Speddie, in a low voice, and with his\nformer troubled expression of face, ’I have seen that your\nattention has been concentrated on my friend.’",
        "’He fascinates me.  I must apologise to you, but he has quite\nbewildered and mastered me.’",
        "’I find that a lonely existence and a long secret,’ said the\nDoctor, drawing his chair a little nearer to Mr. Goodchild’s,\n’become in the course of time very heavy.  I will tell you\nsomething.  You may make what use you will of it, under fictitious\nnames.  I know I may trust you.  I am the more inclined to\nconfidence to-night, through having been unexpectedly led back, by\nthe current of our conversation at the Inn, to scenes in my early\nlife.  Will you please to draw a little nearer?’",
        "Mr. Goodchild drew a little nearer, and the Doctor went on thus:\nspeaking, for the most part, in so cautious a voice, that the wind,\nthough it was far from high, occasionally got the better of him.",
        "When this present nineteenth century was younger by a good many\nyears than it is now, a certain friend of mine, named Arthur\nHolliday, happened to arrive in the town of Doncaster, exactly in\nthe middle of a race-week, or, in other words, in the middle of the\nmonth of September.  He was one of those reckless, rattle-pated,\nopen-hearted, and open-mouthed young gentlemen, who possess the\ngift of familiarity in its highest perfection, and who scramble\ncarelessly along the journey of life making friends, as the phrase\nis, wherever they go.  His father was a rich manufacturer, and had\nbought landed property enough in one of the midland counties to\nmake all the born squires in his neighbourhood thoroughly envious\nof him.  Arthur was his only son, possessor in prospect of the\ngreat estate and the great business after his father’s death; well\nsupplied with money, and not too rigidly looked after, during his\nfather’s lifetime.  Report, or scandal, whichever you please, said\nthat the old gentleman had been rather wild in his youthful days,\nand that, unlike most parents, he was not disposed to be violently\nindignant when he found that his son took after him.  This may be\ntrue or not.  I myself only knew the elder Mr. Holliday when he was\ngetting on in years; and then he was as quiet and as respectable a\ngentleman as ever I met with.",
        "Well, one September, as I told you, young Arthur comes to\nDoncaster, having decided all of a sudden, in his harebrained way,\nthat he would go to the races.  He did not reach the town till\ntowards the close of the evening, and he went at once to see about\nhis dinner and bed at the principal hotel.  Dinner they were ready\nenough to give him; but as for a bed, they laughed when he\nmentioned it.  In the race-week at Doncaster, it is no uncommon\nthing for visitors who have not bespoken apartments, to pass the\nnight in their carriages at the inn doors.  As for the lower sort\nof strangers, I myself have often seen them, at that full time,\nsleeping out on the doorsteps for want of a covered place to creep\nunder.  Rich as he was, Arthur’s chance of getting a night’s\nlodging (seeing that he had not written beforehand to secure one)\nwas more than doubtful.  He tried the second hotel, and the third\nhotel, and two of the inferior inns after that; and was met\neverywhere by the same form of answer.  No accommodation for the\nnight of any sort was left.  All the bright golden sovereigns in\nhis pocket would not buy him a bed at Doncaster in the race-week.",
        "To a young fellow of Arthur’s temperament, the novelty of being\nturned away into the street, like a penniless vagabond, at every\nhouse where he asked for a lodging, presented itself in the light\nof a new and highly amusing piece of experience.  He went on, with\nhis carpet-bag in his hand, applying for a bed at every place of\nentertainment for travellers that he could find in Doncaster, until\nhe wandered into the outskirts of the town.  By this time, the last\nglimmer of twilight had faded out, the moon was rising dimly in a\nmist, the wind was getting cold, the clouds were gathering heavily,\nand there was every prospect that it was soon going to rain.",
        "The look of the night had rather a lowering effect on young\nHolliday’s good spirits.  He began to contemplate the houseless\nsituation in which he was placed, from the serious rather than the\nhumorous point of view; and he looked about him, for another\npublic-house to inquire at, with something very like downright\nanxiety in his mind on the subject of a lodging for the night.  The\nsuburban part of the town towards which he had now strayed was\nhardly lighted at all, and he could see nothing of the houses as he\npassed them, except that they got progressively smaller and\ndirtier, the farther he went.  Down the winding road before him\nshone the dull gleam of an oil lamp, the one faint, lonely light\nthat struggled ineffectually with the foggy darkness all round him.\nHe resolved to go on as far as this lamp, and then, if it showed\nhim nothing in the shape of an Inn, to return to the central part\nof the town and to try if he could not at least secure a chair to\nsit down on, through the night, at one of the principal Hotels.",
        "As he got near the lamp, he heard voices; and, walking close under\nit, found that it lighted the entrance to a narrow court, on the\nwall of which was painted a long hand in faded flesh-colour,\npointing with a lean forefinger, to this inscription:-",
        "\nTHE TWO ROBINS.",
        "\nArthur turned into the court without hesitation, to see what The\nTwo Robins could do for him.  Four or five men were standing\ntogether round the door of the house which was at the bottom of the\ncourt, facing the entrance from the street.  The men were all\nlistening to one other man, better dressed than the rest, who was\ntelling his audience something, in a low voice, in which they were\napparently very much interested.",
        "On entering the passage, Arthur was passed by a stranger with a\nknapsack in his hand, who was evidently leaving the house.",
        "’No,’ said the traveller with the knapsack, turning round and\naddressing himself cheerfully to a fat, sly-looking, bald-headed\nman, with a dirty white apron on, who had followed him down the\npassage.  ’No, Mr. landlord, I am not easily scared by trifles;\nbut, I don’t mind confessing that I can’t quite stand THAT.’",
        "It occurred to young Holliday, the moment he heard these words,\nthat the stranger had been asked an exorbitant price for a bed at\nThe Two Robins; and that he was unable or unwilling to pay it.  The\nmoment his back was turned, Arthur, comfortably conscious of his\nown well-filled pockets, addressed himself in a great hurry, for\nfear any other benighted traveller should slip in and forestall\nhim, to the sly-looking landlord with the dirty apron and the bald\nhead.",
        "’If you have got a bed to let,’ he said, ’and if that gentleman who\nhas just gone out won’t pay your price for it, I will.’",
        "The sly landlord looked hard at Arthur.",
        "’Will you, sir?’ he asked, in a meditative, doubtful way.",
        "’Name your price,’ said young Holliday, thinking that the\nlandlord’s hesitation sprang from some boorish distrust of him.\n’Name your price, and I’ll give you the money at once if you like?’",
        "’Are you game for five shillings?’ inquired the landlord, rubbing\nhis stubbly double chin, and looking up thoughtfully at the ceiling\nabove him.",
        "Arthur nearly laughed in the man’s face; but thinking it prudent to\ncontrol himself, offered the five shillings as seriously as he\ncould.  The sly landlord held out his hand, then suddenly drew it\nback again.",
        "’You’re acting all fair and above-board by me,’ he said:  ’and,\nbefore I take your money, I’ll do the same by you.  Look here, this\nis how it stands.  You can have a bed all to yourself for five\nshillings; but you can’t have more than a half-share of the room it\nstands in.  Do you see what I mean, young gentleman?’",
        "’Of course I do,’ returned Arthur, a little irritably.  ’You mean\nthat it is a double-bedded room, and that one of the beds is\noccupied?’",
        "The landlord nodded his head, and rubbed his double chin harder\nthan ever.  Arthur hesitated, and mechanically moved back a step or\ntwo towards the door.  The idea of sleeping in the same room with a\ntotal stranger, did not present an attractive prospect to him.  He\nfelt more than half inclined to drop his five shillings into his\npocket, and to go out into the street once more.",
        "’Is it yes, or no?’ asked the landlord.  ’Settle it as quick as you\ncan, because there’s lots of people wanting a bed at Doncaster to-\nnight, besides you.’",
        "Arthur looked towards the court, and heard the rain falling heavily\nin the street outside.  He thought he would ask a question or two\nbefore he rashly decided on leaving the shelter of The Two Robins.",
        "’What sort of a man is it who has got the other bed?’ he inquired.\n’Is he a gentleman?  I mean, is he a quiet, well-behaved person?’",
        "’The quietest man I ever came across,’ said the landlord, rubbing\nhis fat hands stealthily one over the other.  ’As sober as a judge,\nand as regular as clock-work in his habits.  It hasn’t struck nine,\nnot ten minutes ago, and he’s in his bed already.  I don’t know\nwhether that comes up to your notion of a quiet man:  it goes a\nlong way ahead of mine, I can tell you.’",
        "’Is he asleep, do you think?’ asked Arthur.",
        "’I know he’s asleep,’ returned the landlord.  ’And what’s more,\nhe’s gone off so fast, that I’ll warrant you don’t wake him.  This\nway, sir,’ said the landlord, speaking over young Holliday’s\nshoulder, as if he was addressing some new guest who was\napproaching the house.",
        "’Here you are,’ said Arthur, determined to be beforehand with the\nstranger, whoever he might be.  ’I’ll take the bed.’  And he handed\nthe five shillings to the landlord, who nodded, dropped the money\ncarelessly into his waistcoat-pocket, and lighted the candle.",
        "’Come up and see the room,’ said the host of The Two Robins,\nleading the way to the staircase quite briskly, considering how fat\nhe was.",
        "They mounted to the second-floor of the house.  The landlord half\nopened a door, fronting the landing, then stopped, and turned round\nto Arthur.",
        "’It’s a fair bargain, mind, on my side as well as on yours,’ he\nsaid.  ’You give me five shillings, I give you in return a clean,\ncomfortable bed; and I warrant, beforehand, that you won’t be\ninterfered with, or annoyed in any way, by the man who sleeps in\nthe same room as you.’  Saying those words, he looked hard, for a\nmoment, in young Holliday’s face, and then led the way into the\nroom.",
        "It was larger and cleaner than Arthur had expected it would be.\nThe two beds stood parallel with each other - a space of about six\nfeet intervening between them.  They were both of the same medium\nsize, and both had the same plain white curtains, made to draw, if\nnecessary, all round them.  The occupied bed was the bed nearest\nthe window.  The curtains were all drawn round this, except the\nhalf curtain at the bottom, on the side of the bed farthest from\nthe window.  Arthur saw the feet of the sleeping man raising the\nscanty clothes into a sharp little eminence, as if he was lying\nflat on his back.  He took the candle, and advanced softly to draw\nthe curtain - stopped half-way, and listened for a moment - then\nturned to the landlord.",
        "’He’s a very quiet sleeper,’ said Arthur.",
        "’Yes,’ said the landlord, ’very quiet.’",
        "Young Holliday advanced with the candle, and looked in at the man\ncautiously.",
        "’How pale he is!’ said Arthur.",
        "’Yes,’ returned the landlord, ’pale enough, isn’t he?’",
        "Arthur looked closer at the man.  The bedclothes were drawn up to\nhis chin, and they lay perfectly still over the region of his\nchest.  Surprised and vaguely startled, as he noticed this, Arthur\nstooped down closer over the stranger; looked at his ashy, parted\nlips; listened breathlessly for an instant; looked again at the\nstrangely still face, and the motionless lips and chest; and turned\nround suddenly on the landlord, with his own cheeks as pale for the\nmoment as the hollow cheeks of the man on the bed.",
        "’Come here,’ he whispered, under his breath.  ’Come here, for God’s\nsake!  The man’s not asleep - he is dead!’",
        "’You have found that out sooner than I thought you would,’ said the\nlandlord, composedly.  ’Yes, he’s dead, sure enough.  He died at\nfive o’clock to-day.’",
        "’How did he die?  Who is he?’ asked Arthur, staggered, for a\nmoment, by the audacious coolness of the answer.",
        "’As to who is he,’ rejoined the landlord, ’I know no more about him\nthan you do.  There are his books and letters and things, all\nsealed up in that brown-paper parcel, for the Coroner’s inquest to\nopen to-morrow or next day.  He’s been here a week, paying his way\nfairly enough, and stopping in-doors, for the most part, as if he\nwas ailing.  My girl brought him up his tea at five to-day; and as\nhe was pouring of it out, he fell down in a faint, or a fit, or a\ncompound of both, for anything I know.  We could not bring him to -\nand I said he was dead.  And the doctor couldn’t bring him to - and\nthe doctor said he was dead.  And there he is.  And the Coroner’s\ninquest’s coming as soon as it can.  And that’s as much as I know\nabout it.’",
        "Arthur held the candle close to the man’s lips.  The flame still\nburnt straight up, as steadily as before.  There was a moment of\nsilence; and the rain pattered drearily through it against the\npanes of the window.",
        "’If you haven’t got nothing more to say to me,’ continued the\nlandlord, ’I suppose I may go.  You don’t expect your five\nshillings back, do you?  There’s the bed I promised you, clean and\ncomfortable.  There’s the man I warranted not to disturb you, quiet\nin this world for ever.  If you’re frightened to stop alone with\nhim, that’s not my look out.  I’ve kept my part of the bargain, and\nI mean to keep the money.  I’m not Yorkshire, myself, young\ngentleman; but I’ve lived long enough in these parts to have my\nwits sharpened; and I shouldn’t wonder if you found out the way to\nbrighten up yours, next time you come amongst us.’  With these\nwords, the landlord turned towards the door, and laughed to himself\nsoftly, in high satisfaction at his own sharpness.",
        "Startled and shocked as he was, Arthur had by this time\nsufficiently recovered himself to feel indignant at the trick that\nhad been played on him, and at the insolent manner in which the\nlandlord exulted in it.",
        "’Don’t laugh,’ he said sharply, ’till you are quite sure you have\ngot the laugh against me.  You shan’t have the five shillings for\nnothing, my man.  I’ll keep the bed.’",
        "’Will you?’ said the landlord.  ’Then I wish you a goodnight’s\nrest.’  With that brief farewell, he went out, and shut the door\nafter him.",
        "A good night’s rest!  The words had hardly been spoken, the door\nhad hardly been closed, before Arthur half-repented the hasty words\nthat had just escaped him.  Though not naturally over-sensitive,\nand not wanting in courage of the moral as well as the physical\nsort, the presence of the dead man had an instantaneously chilling\neffect on his mind when he found himself alone in the room - alone,\nand bound by his own rash words to stay there till the next\nmorning.  An older man would have thought nothing of those words,\nand would have acted, without reference to them, as his calmer\nsense suggested.  But Arthur was too young to treat the ridicule,\neven of his inferiors, with contempt - too young not to fear the\nmomentary humiliation of falsifying his own foolish boast, more\nthan he feared the trial of watching out the long night in the same\nchamber with the dead.",
        "’It is but a few hours,’ he thought to himself, ’and I can get away\nthe first thing in the morning.’",
        "He was looking towards the occupied bed as that idea passed through\nhis mind, and the sharp, angular eminence made in the clothes by\nthe dead man’s upturned feet again caught his eye.  He advanced and\ndrew the curtains, purposely abstaining, as he did so, from looking\nat the face of the corpse, lest he might unnerve himself at the\noutset by fastening some ghastly impression of it on his mind.  He\ndrew the curtain very gently, and sighed involuntarily as he closed\nit.  ’Poor fellow,’ he said, almost as sadly as if he had known the\nman.  ’Ah, poor fellow!’",
        "He went next to the window.  The night was black, and he could see\nnothing from it.  The rain still pattered heavily against the\nglass.  He inferred, from hearing it, that the window was at the\nback of the house; remembering that the front was sheltered from\nthe weather by the court and the buildings over it.",
        "While he was still standing at the window - for even the dreary\nrain was a relief, because of the sound it made; a relief, also,\nbecause it moved, and had some faint suggestion, in consequence, of\nlife and companionship in it - while he was standing at the window,\nand looking vacantly into the black darkness outside, he heard a\ndistant church-clock strike ten.  Only ten!  How was he to pass the\ntime till the house was astir the next morning?",
        "Under any other circumstances, he would have gone down to the\npublic-house parlour, would have called for his grog, and would\nhave laughed and talked with the company assembled as familiarly as\nif he had known them all his life.  But the very thought of whiling\naway the time in this manner was distasteful to him.  The new\nsituation in which he was placed seemed to have altered him to\nhimself already.  Thus far, his life had been the common, trifling,\nprosaic, surface-life of a prosperous young man, with no troubles\nto conquer, and no trials to face.  He had lost no relation whom he\nloved, no friend whom he treasured.  Till this night, what share he\nhad of the immortal inheritance that is divided amongst us all, had\nlaid dormant within him.  Till this night, Death and he had not\nonce met, even in thought.",
        "He took a few turns up and down the room - then stopped.  The noise\nmade by his boots on the poorly carpeted floor, jarred on his ear.\nHe hesitated a little, and ended by taking the boots off, and\nwalking backwards and forwards noiselessly.  All desire to sleep or\nto rest had left him.  The bare thought of lying down on the\nunoccupied bed instantly drew the picture on his mind of a dreadful\nmimicry of the position of the dead man.  Who was he?  What was the\nstory of his past life?  Poor he must have been, or he would not\nhave stopped at such a place as The Two Robins Inn - and weakened,\nprobably, by long illness, or he could hardly have died in the\nmanner in which the landlord had described.  Poor, ill, lonely, -\ndead in a strange place; dead, with nobody but a stranger to pity\nhim.  A sad story:  truly, on the mere face of it, a very sad\nstory.",
        "While these thoughts were passing through his mind, he had stopped\ninsensibly at the window, close to which stood the foot of the bed\nwith the closed curtains.  At first he looked at it absently; then\nhe became conscious that his eyes were fixed on it; and then, a\nperverse desire took possession of him to do the very thing which\nhe had resolved not to do, up to this time - to look at the dead\nman.",
        "He stretched out his hand towards the curtains; but checked himself\nin the very act of undrawing them, turned his back sharply on the\nbed, and walked towards the chimney-piece, to see what things were\nplaced on it, and to try if he could keep the dead man out of his\nmind in that way.",
        "There was a pewter inkstand on the chimney-piece, with some\nmildewed remains of ink in the bottle.  There were two coarse china\nornaments of the commonest kind; and there was a square of embossed\ncard, dirty and fly-blown, with a collection of wretched riddles\nprinted on it, in all sorts of zig-zag directions, and in variously\ncoloured inks.  He took the card, and went away, to read it, to the\ntable on which the candle was placed; sitting down, with his back\nresolutely turned to the curtained bed.",
        "He read the first riddle, the second, the third, all in one corner\nof the card - then turned it round impatiently to look at another.\nBefore he could begin reading the riddles printed here, the sound\nof the church-clock stopped him.  Eleven.  He had got through an\nhour of the time, in the room with the dead man.",
        "Once more he looked at the card.  It was not easy to make out the\nletters printed on it, in consequence of the dimness of the light\nwhich the landlord had left him - a common tallow candle, furnished\nwith a pair of heavy old-fashioned steel snuffers.  Up to this\ntime, his mind had been too much occupied to think of the light.\nHe had left the wick of the candle unsnuffed, till it had risen\nhigher than the flame, and had burnt into an odd pent-house shape\nat the top, from which morsels of the charred cotton fell off, from\ntime to time, in little flakes.  He took up the snuffers now, and\ntrimmed the wick.  The light brightened directly, and the room\nbecame less dismal.",
        "Again he turned to the riddles; reading them doggedly and\nresolutely, now in one corner of the card, now in another.  All his\nefforts, however, could not fix his attention on them.  He pursued\nhis occupation mechanically, deriving no sort of impression from\nwhat he was reading.  It was as if a shadow from the curtained bed\nhad got between his mind and the gaily printed letters - a shadow\nthat nothing could dispel.  At last, he gave up the struggle, and\nthrew the card from him impatiently, and took to walking softly up\nand down the room again.",
        "The dead man, the dead man, the HIDDEN dead man on the bed!  There\nwas the one persistent idea still haunting him.  Hidden?  Was it\nonly the body being there, or was it the body being there,\nconcealed, that was preying on his mind?  He stopped at the window,\nwith that doubt in him; once more listening to the pattering rain,\nonce more looking out into the black darkness.",
        "Still the dead man!  The darkness forced his mind back upon itself,\nand set his memory at work, reviving, with a painfully-vivid\ndistinctness the momentary impression it had received from the\nfirst sight of the corpse.  Before long the face seemed to be\nhovering out in the middle of the darkness, confronting him through\nthe window, with the paleness whiter, with the dreadful dull line\nof light between the imperfectly-closed eyelids broader than he had\nseen it - with the parted lips slowly dropping farther and farther\naway from each other - with the features growing larger and moving\ncloser, till they seemed to fill the window and to silence the\nrain, and to shut out the night.",
        "The sound of a voice, shouting below-stairs, woke him suddenly from\nthe dream of his own distempered fancy.  He recognised it as the\nvoice of the landlord.  ’Shut up at twelve, Ben,’ he heard it say.\n’I’m off to bed.’",
        "He wiped away the damp that had gathered on his forehead, reasoned\nwith himself for a little while, and resolved to shake his mind\nfree of the ghastly counterfeit which still clung to it, by forcing\nhimself to confront, if it was only for a moment, the solemn\nreality.  Without allowing himself an instant to hesitate, he\nparted the curtains at the foot of the bed, and looked through.",
        "There was a sad, peaceful, white face, with the awful mystery of\nstillness on it, laid back upon the pillow.  No stir, no change\nthere!  He only looked at it for a moment before he closed the\ncurtains again - but that moment steadied him, calmed him, restored\nhim - mind and body - to himself.",
        "He returned to his old occupation of walking up and down the room;\npersevering in it, this time, till the clock struck again.  Twelve.",
        "As the sound of the clock-bell died away, it was succeeded by the\nconfused noise, down-stairs, of the drinkers in the tap-room\nleaving the house.  The next sound, after an interval of silence,\nwas caused by the barring of the door, and the closing of the\nshutters, at the back of the Inn.  Then the silence followed again,\nand was disturbed no more.",
        "He was alone now - absolutely, utterly, alone with the dead man,\ntill the next morning.",
        "The wick of the candle wanted trimming again.  He took up the\nsnuffers - but paused suddenly on the very point of using them, and\nlooked attentively at the candle - then back, over his shoulder, at\nthe curtained bed - then again at the candle.  It had been lighted,\nfor the first time, to show him the way up-stairs, and three parts\nof it, at least, were already consumed.  In another hour it would\nbe burnt out.  In another hour - unless he called at once to the\nman who had shut up the Inn, for a fresh candle - he would be left\nin the dark.",
        "Strongly as his mind had been affected since he had entered his\nroom, his unreasonable dread of encountering ridicule, and of\nexposing his courage to suspicion, had not altogether lost its\ninfluence over him, even yet.  He lingered irresolutely by the\ntable, waiting till he could prevail on himself to open the door,\nand call, from the landing, to the man who had shut up the Inn.  In\nhis present hesitating frame of mind, it was a kind of relief to\ngain a few moments only by engaging in the trifling occupation of\nsnuffing the candle.  His hand trembled a little, and the snuffers\nwere heavy and awkward to use.  When he closed them on the wick, he\nclosed them a hair’s breadth too low.  In an instant the candle was\nout, and the room was plunged in pitch darkness.",
        "The one impression which the absence of light immediately produced\non his mind, was distrust of the curtained bed - distrust which\nshaped itself into no distinct idea, but which was powerful enough\nin its very vagueness, to bind him down to his chair, to make his\nheart beat fast, and to set him listening intently.  No sound\nstirred in the room but the familiar sound of the rain against the\nwindow, louder and sharper now than he had heard it yet.",
        "Still the vague distrust, the inexpressible dread possessed him,\nand kept him to his chair.  He had put his carpet-bag on the table,\nwhen he first entered the room; and he now took the key from his\npocket, reached out his hand softly, opened the bag, and groped in\nit for his travelling writing-case, in which he knew that there was\na small store of matches.  When he had got one of the matches, he\nwaited before he struck it on the coarse wooden table, and listened\nintently again, without knowing why.  Still there was no sound in\nthe room but the steady, ceaseless, rattling sound of the rain.",
        "He lighted the candle again, without another moment of delay and,\non the instant of its burning up, the first object in the room that\nhis eyes sought for was the curtained bed.",
        "Just before the light had been put out, he had looked in that\ndirection, and had seen no change, no disarrangement of any sort,\nin the folds of the closely-drawn curtains.",
        "When he looked at the bed, now, he saw, hanging over the side of\nit, a long white hand.",
        "It lay perfectly motionless, midway on the side of the bed, where\nthe curtain at the head and the curtain at the foot met.  Nothing\nmore was visible.  The clinging curtains hid everything but the\nlong white hand.",
        "He stood looking at it unable to stir, unable to call out; feeling\nnothing, knowing nothing, every faculty he possessed gathered up\nand lost in the one seeing faculty.  How long that first panic held\nhim he never could tell afterwards.  It might have been only for a\nmoment; it might have been for many minutes together.  How he got\nto the bed - whether he ran to it headlong, or whether he\napproached it slowly - how he wrought himself up to unclose the\ncurtains and look in, he never has remembered, and never will\nremember to his dying day.  It is enough that he did go to the bed,\nand that he did look inside the curtains.",
        "The man had moved.  One of his arms was outside the clothes; his\nface was turned a little on the pillow; his eyelids were wide open.\nChanged as to position, and as to one of the features, the face\nwas, otherwise, fearfully and wonderfully unaltered.  The dead\npaleness and the dead quiet were on it still",
        "One glance showed Arthur this - one glance, before he flew\nbreathlessly to the door, and alarmed the house.",
        "The man whom the landlord called ’Ben,’ was the first to appear on\nthe stairs.  In three words, Arthur told him what had happened, and\nsent him for the nearest doctor.",
        "I, who tell you this story, was then staying with a medical friend\nof mine, in practice at Doncaster, taking care of his patients for\nhim, during his absence in London; and I, for the time being, was\nthe nearest doctor.  They had sent for me from the Inn, when the\nstranger was taken ill in the afternoon; but I was not at home, and\nmedical assistance was sought for elsewhere.  When the man from The\nTwo Robins rang the night-bell, I was just thinking of going to\nbed.  Naturally enough, I did not believe a word of his story about\n’a dead man who had come to life again.’  However, I put on my hat,\narmed myself with one or two bottles of restorative medicine, and\nran to the Inn, expecting to find nothing more remarkable, when I\ngot there, than a patient in a fit.",
        "My surprise at finding that the man had spoken the literal truth\nwas almost, if not quite, equalled by my astonishment at finding\nmyself face to face with Arthur Holliday as soon as I entered the\nbedroom.  It was no time then for giving or seeking explanations.\nWe just shook hands amazedly; and then I ordered everybody but\nArthur out of the room, and hurried to the man on the bed.",
        "The kitchen fire had not been long out.  There was plenty of hot\nwater in the boiler, and plenty of flannel to be had.  With these,\nwith my medicines, and with such help as Arthur could render under\nmy direction, I dragged the man, literally, out of the jaws of\ndeath.  In less than an hour from the time when I had been called\nin, he was alive and talking in the bed on which he had been laid\nout to wait for the Coroner’s inquest.",
        "You will naturally ask me, what had been the matter with him; and I\nmight treat you, in reply, to a long theory, plentifully sprinkled\nwith, what the children call, hard words.  I prefer telling you\nthat, in this case, cause and effect could not be satisfactorily\njoined together by any theory whatever.  There are mysteries in\nlife, and the condition of it, which human science has not fathomed\nyet; and I candidly confess to you, that, in bringing that man back\nto existence, I was, morally speaking, groping haphazard in the\ndark.  I know (from the testimony of the doctor who attended him in\nthe afternoon) that the vital machinery, so far as its action is\nappreciable by our senses, had, in this case, unquestionably\nstopped; and I am equally certain (seeing that I recovered him)\nthat the vital principle was not extinct.  When I add, that he had\nsuffered from a long and complicated illness, and that his whole\nnervous system was utterly deranged, I have told you all I really\nknow of the physical condition of my dead-alive patient at The Two\nRobins Inn.",
        "When he ’came to,’ as the phrase goes, he was a startling object to\nlook at, with his colourless face, his sunken cheeks, his wild\nblack eyes, and his long black hair.  The first question he asked\nme about himself, when he could speak, made me suspect that I had\nbeen called in to a man in my own profession.  I mentioned to him\nmy surmise; and he told me that I was right.",
        "He said he had come last from Paris, where he had been attached to\na hospital.  That he had lately returned to England, on his way to\nEdinburgh, to continue his studies; that he had been taken ill on\nthe journey; and that he had stopped to rest and recover himself at\nDoncaster.  He did not add a word about his name, or who he was:\nand, of course, I did not question him on the subject.  All I\ninquired, when he ceased speaking, was what branch of the\nprofession he intended to follow.",
        "’Any branch,’ he said, bitterly, ’which will put bread into the\nmouth of a poor man.’",
        "At this, Arthur, who had been hitherto watching him in silent\ncuriosity, burst out impetuously in his usual good-humoured way:-",
        "’My dear fellow!’ (everybody was ’my dear fellow’ with Arthur) ’now\nyou have come to life again, don’t begin by being down-hearted\nabout your prospects.  I’ll answer for it, I can help you to some\ncapital thing in the medical line - or, if I can’t, I know my\nfather can.’",
        "The medical student looked at him steadily.",
        "’Thank you,’ he said, coldly.  Then added, ’May I ask who your\nfather is?’",
        "’He’s well enough known all about this part of the country,’\nreplied Arthur.  ’He is a great manufacturer, and his name is\nHolliday.’",
        "My hand was on the man’s wrist during this brief conversation.  The\ninstant the name of Holliday was pronounced I felt the pulse under\nmy fingers flutter, stop, go on suddenly with a bound, and beat\nafterwards, for a minute or two, at the fever rate.",
        "’How did you come here?’ asked the stranger, quickly, excitably,\npassionately almost.",
        "Arthur related briefly what had happened from the time of his first\ntaking the bed at the inn.",
        "’I am indebted to Mr. Holliday’s son then for the help that has\nsaved my life,’ said the medical student, speaking to himself, with\na singular sarcasm in his voice.  ’Come here!’",
        "He held out, as he spoke, his long, white, bony, right hand.",
        "’With all my heart,’ said Arthur, taking the hand-cordially.  ’I\nmay confess it now,’ he continued, laughing.  ’Upon my honour, you\nalmost frightened me out of my wits.’",
        "The stranger did not seem to listen.  His wild black eyes were\nfixed with a look of eager interest on Arthur’s face, and his long\nbony fingers kept tight hold of Arthur’s hand.  Young Holliday, on\nhis side, returned the gaze, amazed and puzzled by the medical\nstudent’s odd language and manners.  The two faces were close\ntogether; I looked at them; and, to my amazement, I was suddenly\nimpressed by the sense of a likeness between them - not in\nfeatures, or complexion, but solely in expression.  It must have\nbeen a strong likeness, or I should certainly not have found it\nout, for I am naturally slow at detecting resemblances between\nfaces.",
        "’You have saved my life,’ said the strange man, still looking hard\nin Arthur’s face, still holding tightly by his hand.  ’If you had\nbeen my own brother, you could not have done more for me than\nthat.’",
        "He laid a singularly strong emphasis on those three words ’my own\nbrother,’ and a change passed over his face as he pronounced them,\n- a change that no language of mine is competent to describe.",
        "’I hope I have not done being of service to you yet,’ said Arthur.\n’I’ll speak to my father, as soon as I get home.’",
        "’You seem to be fond and proud of your father,’ said the medical\nstudent.  ’I suppose, in return, he is fond and proud of you?’",
        "’Of course, he is!’ answered Arthur, laughing.  ’Is there anything\nwonderful in that?  Isn’t YOUR father fond - ’",
        "The stranger suddenly dropped young Holliday’s hand, and turned his\nface away.",
        "’I beg your pardon,’ said Arthur.  ’I hope I have not\nunintentionally pained you.  I hope you have not lost your father.’",
        "’I can’t well lose what I have never had,’ retorted the medical\nstudent, with a harsh, mocking laugh.",
        "’What you have never had!’",
        "The strange man suddenly caught Arthur’s hand again, suddenly\nlooked once more hard in his face.",
        "’Yes,’ he said, with a repetition of the bitter laugh.  ’You have\nbrought a poor devil back into the world, who has no business\nthere.  Do I astonish you?  Well!  I have a fancy of my own for\ntelling you what men in my situation generally keep a secret.  I\nhave no name and no father.  The merciful law of Society tells me I\nam Nobody’s Son!  Ask your father if he will be my father too, and\nhelp me on in life with the family name.’",
        "Arthur looked at me, more puzzled than ever.  I signed to him to\nsay nothing, and then laid my fingers again on the man’s wrist.\nNo!  In spite of the extraordinary speech that he had just made, he\nwas not, as I had been disposed to suspect, beginning to get light-\nheaded.  His pulse, by this time, had fallen back to a quiet, slow\nbeat, and his skin was moist and cool.  Not a symptom of fever or\nagitation about him.",
        "Finding that neither of us answered him, he turned to me, and began\ntalking of the extraordinary nature of his case, and asking my\nadvice about the future course of medical treatment to which he\nought to subject himself.  I said the matter required careful\nthinking over, and suggested that I should submit certain\nprescriptions to him the next morning.  He told me to write them at\nonce, as he would, most likely, be leaving Doncaster, in the\nmorning, before I was up.  It was quite useless to represent to him\nthe folly and danger of such a proceeding as this.  He heard me\npolitely and patiently, but held to his resolution, without\noffering any reasons or any explanations, and repeated to me, that\nif I wished to give him a chance of seeing my prescription, I must\nwrite it at once.  Hearing this, Arthur volunteered the loan of a\ntravelling writing-case, which, he said, he had with him; and,\nbringing it to the bed, shook the note-paper out of the pocket of\nthe case forthwith in his usual careless way.  With the paper,\nthere fell out on the counterpane of the bed a small packet of\nsticking-plaster, and a little water-colour drawing of a landscape.",
        "The medical student took up the drawing and looked at it.  His eye\nfell on some initials neatly written, in cypher, in one corner.  He\nstarted and trembled; his pale face grew whiter than ever; his wild\nblack eyes turned on Arthur, and looked through and through him.",
        "’A pretty drawing,’ he said in a remarkably quiet tone of voice.",
        "’Ah! and done by such a pretty girl,’ said Arthur.  ’Oh, such a\npretty girl!  I wish it was not a landscape - I wish it was a\nportrait of her!’",
        "’You admire her very much?’",
        "Arthur, half in jest, half in earnest, kissed his hand for answer.",
        "’Love at first sight!’ he said, putting the drawing away again.\n’But the course of it doesn’t run smooth.  It’s the old story.\nShe’s monopolised as usual.  Trammelled by a rash engagement to\nsome poor man who is never likely to get money enough to marry her.\nIt was lucky I heard of it in time, or I should certainly have\nrisked a declaration when she gave me that drawing.  Here, doctor!\nHere is pen, ink, and paper all ready for you.’",
        "’When she gave you that drawing?  Gave it.  Gave it.’  He repeated\nthe words slowly to himself, and suddenly closed his eyes.  A\nmomentary distortion passed across his face, and I saw one of his\nhands clutch up the bedclothes and squeeze them hard.  I thought he\nwas going to be ill again, and begged that there might be no more\ntalking.  He opened his eyes when I spoke, fixed them once more\nsearchingly on Arthur, and said, slowly and distinctly, ’You like\nher, and she likes you.  The poor man may die out of your way.  Who\ncan tell that she may not give you herself as well as her drawing,\nafter all?’",
        "Before young Holliday could answer, he turned to me, and said in a\nwhisper, ’Now for the prescription.’  From that time, though he\nspoke to Arthur again, he never looked at him more.",
        "When I had written the prescription, he examined it, approved of\nit, and then astonished us both by abruptly wishing us good night.\nI offered to sit up with him, and he shook his head.  Arthur\noffered to sit up with him, and he said, shortly, with his face\nturned away, ’No.’  I insisted on having somebody left to watch\nhim.  He gave way when he found I was determined, and said he would\naccept the services of the waiter at the Inn.",
        "’Thank you, both,’ he said, as we rose to go.  ’I have one last\nfavour to ask - not of you, doctor, for I leave you to exercise\nyour professional discretion - but of Mr. Holliday.’  His eyes,\nwhile he spoke, still rested steadily on me, and never once turned\ntowards Arthur.  ’I beg that Mr. Holliday will not mention to any\none - least of all to his father - the events that have occurred,\nand the words that have passed, in this room.  I entreat him to\nbury me in his memory, as, but for him, I might have been buried in\nmy grave.  I cannot give my reasons for making this strange\nrequest.  I can only implore him to grant it.’",
        "His voice faltered for the first time, and he hid his face on the\npillow.  Arthur, completely bewildered, gave the required pledge.\nI took young Holliday away with me, immediately afterwards, to the\nhouse of my friend; determining to go back to the Inn, and to see\nthe medical student again before he had left in the morning.",
        "I returned to the Inn at eight o’clock, purposely abstaining from\nwaking Arthur, who was sleeping off the past night’s excitement on\none of my friend’s sofas.  A suspicion had occurred to me as soon\nas I was alone in my bedroom, which made me resolve that Holliday\nand the stranger whose life he had saved should not meet again, if\nI could prevent it.  I have already alluded to certain reports, or\nscandals, which I knew of, relating to the early life of Arthur’s\nfather.  While I was thinking, in my bed, of what had passed at the\nInn - of the change in the student’s pulse when he heard the name\nof Holliday; of the resemblance of expression that I had discovered\nbetween his face and Arthur’s; of the emphasis he had laid on those\nthree words, ’my own brother;’ and of his incomprehensible\nacknowledgment of his own illegitimacy - while I was thinking of\nthese things, the reports I have mentioned suddenly flew into my\nmind, and linked themselves fast to the chain of my previous\nreflections.  Something within me whispered, ’It is best that those\ntwo young men should not meet again.’  I felt it before I slept; I\nfelt it when I woke; and I went, as I told you, alone to the Inn\nthe next morning.",
        "I had missed my only opportunity of seeing my nameless patient\nagain.  He had been gone nearly an hour when I inquired for him.",
        "\nI have now told you everything that I know for certain, in relation\nto the man whom I brought back to life in the double-bedded room of\nthe Inn at Doncaster.  What I have next to add is matter for\ninference and surmise, and is not, strictly speaking, matter of\nfact.",
        "I have to tell you, first, that the medical student turned out to\nbe strangely and unaccountably right in assuming it as more than\nprobable that Arthur Holliday would marry the young lady who had\ngiven him the water-colour drawing of the landscape.  That marriage\ntook place a little more than a year after the events occurred\nwhich I have just been relating.  The young couple came to live in\nthe neighbourhood in which I was then established in practice.  I\nwas present at the wedding, and was rather surprised to find that\nArthur was singularly reserved with me, both before and after his\nmarriage, on the subject of the young lady’s prior engagement.  He\nonly referred to it once, when we were alone, merely telling me, on\nthat occasion, that his wife had done all that honour and duty\nrequired of her in the matter, and that the engagement had been\nbroken off with the full approval of her parents.  I never heard\nmore from him than this.  For three years he and his wife lived\ntogether happily.  At the expiration of that time, the symptoms of\na serious illness first declared themselves in Mrs. Arthur\nHolliday.  It turned out to be a long, lingering, hopeless malady.\nI attended her throughout.  We had been great friends when she was\nwell, and we became more attached to each other than ever when she\nwas ill.  I had many long and interesting conversations with her in\nthe intervals when she suffered least.  The result of one of these\nconversations I may briefly relate, leaving you to draw any\ninferences from it that you please.",
        "The interview to which I refer, occurred shortly before her death.\nI called one evening, as usual, and found her alone, with a look in\nher eyes which told me that she had been crying.  She only informed\nme at first, that she had been depressed in spirits; but, by little\nand little, she became more communicative, and confessed to me that\nshe had been looking over some old letters, which had been\naddressed to her, before she had seen Arthur, by a man to whom she\nhad been engaged to be married.  I asked her how the engagement\ncame to be broken off.  She replied that it had not been broken\noff, but that it had died out in a very mysterious way.  The person\nto whom she was engaged - her first love, she called him - was very\npoor, and there was no immediate prospect of their being married.\nHe followed my profession, and went abroad to study.  They had\ncorresponded regularly, until the time when, as she believed, he\nhad returned to England.  From that period she heard no more of\nhim.  He was of a fretful, sensitive temperament; and she feared\nthat she might have inadvertently done or said something that\noffended him.  However that might be, he had never written to her\nagain; and, after waiting a year, she had married Arthur.  I asked\nwhen the first estrangement had begun, and found that the time at\nwhich she ceased to hear anything of her first lover exactly\ncorresponded with the time at which I had been called in to my\nmysterious patient at The Two Robins Inn.",
        "A fortnight after that conversation, she died.  In course of time,\nArthur married again.  Of late years, he has lived principally in\nLondon, and I have seen little or nothing of him.",
        "I have many years to pass over before I can approach to anything\nlike a conclusion of this fragmentary narrative.  And even when\nthat later period is reached, the little that I have to say will\nnot occupy your attention for more than a few minutes.  Between six\nand seven years ago, the gentleman to whom I introduced you in this\nroom, came to me, with good professional recommendations, to fill\nthe position of my assistant.  We met, not like strangers, but like\nfriends - the only difference between us being, that I was very\nmuch surprised to see him, and that he did not appear to be at all\nsurprised to see me.  If he was my son or my brother, I believe he\ncould not be fonder of me than he is; but he has never volunteered\nany confidences since he has been here, on the subject of his past\nlife.  I saw something that was familiar to me in his face when we\nfirst met; and yet it was also something that suggested the idea of\nchange.  I had a notion once that my patient at the Inn might be a\nnatural son of Mr. Holliday’s; I had another idea that he might\nalso have been the man who was engaged to Arthur’s first wife; and\nI have a third idea, still clinging to me, that Mr. Lorn is the\nonly man in England who could really enlighten me, if he chose, on\nboth those doubtful points.  His hair is not black, now, and his\neyes are dimmer than the piercing eyes that I remember, but, for\nall that, he is very like the nameless medical student of my young\ndays - very like him.  And, sometimes, when I come home late at\nnight, and find him asleep, and wake him, he looks, in coming to,\nwonderfully like the stranger at Doncaster, as he raised himself in\nthe bed on that memorable night!",
        "The Doctor paused.  Mr. Goodchild, who had been following every\nword that fell from his lips up to this time, leaned forward\neagerly to ask a question.  Before he could say a word, the latch\nof the door was raised, without any warning sound of footsteps in\nthe passage outside.  A long, white, bony hand appeared through the\nopening, gently pushing the door, which was prevented from working\nfreely on its hinges by a fold in the carpet under it.",
        "’That hand!  Look at that hand, Doctor!’ said Mr. Goodchild,\ntouching him.",
        "At the same moment, the Doctor looked at Mr. Goodchild, and\nwhispered to him, significantly:",
        "’Hush! he has come back.’",
        "The Cumberland Doctor’s mention of Doncaster Races, inspired Mr.\nFrancis Goodchild with the idea of going down to Doncaster to see\nthe races.  Doncaster being a good way off, and quite out of the\nway of the Idle Apprentices (if anything could be out of their way,\nwho had no way), it necessarily followed that Francis perceived\nDoncaster in the race-week to be, of all possible idleness, the\nparticular idleness that would completely satisfy him.",
        "Thomas, with an enforced idleness grafted on the natural and\nvoluntary power of his disposition, was not of this mind; objecting\nthat a man compelled to lie on his back on a floor, a sofa, a\ntable, a line of chairs, or anything he could get to lie upon, was\nnot in racing condition, and that he desired nothing better than to\nlie where he was, enjoying himself in looking at the flies on the\nceiling.  But, Francis Goodchild, who had been walking round his\ncompanion in a circuit of twelve miles for two days, and had begun\nto doubt whether it was reserved for him ever to be idle in his\nlife, not only overpowered this objection, but even converted\nThomas Idle to a scheme he formed (another idle inspiration), of\nconveying the said Thomas to the sea-coast, and putting his injured\nleg under a stream of salt-water.",
        "Plunging into this happy conception headforemost, Mr. Goodchild\nimmediately referred to the county-map, and ardently discovered\nthat the most delicious piece of sea-coast to be found within the\nlimits of England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, and\nthe Channel Islands, all summed up together, was Allonby on the\ncoast of Cumberland.  There was the coast of Scotland opposite to\nAllonby, said Mr. Goodchild with enthusiasm; there was a fine\nScottish mountain on that Scottish coast; there were Scottish\nlights to be seen shining across the glorious Channel, and at\nAllonby itself there was every idle luxury (no doubt) that a\nwatering-place could offer to the heart of idle man.  Moreover,\nsaid Mr. Goodchild, with his finger on the map, this exquisite\nretreat was approached by a coach-road, from a railway-station\ncalled Aspatria - a name, in a manner, suggestive of the departed\nglories of Greece, associated with one of the most engaging and\nmost famous of Greek women.  On this point, Mr. Goodchild continued\nat intervals to breathe a vein of classic fancy and eloquence\nexceedingly irksome to Mr. Idle, until it appeared that the honest\nEnglish pronunciation of that Cumberland country shortened Aspatria\ninto ’Spatter.’  After this supplementary discovery, Mr. Goodchild\nsaid no more about it.",
        "By way of Spatter, the crippled Idle was carried, hoisted, pushed,\npoked, and packed, into and out of carriages, into and out of beds,\ninto and out of tavern resting-places, until he was brought at\nlength within sniff of the sea.  And now, behold the apprentices\ngallantly riding into Allonby in a one-horse fly, bent upon staying\nin that peaceful marine valley until the turbulent Doncaster time\nshall come round upon the wheel, in its turn among what are in\nsporting registers called the ’Fixtures’ for the month.",
        "’Do you see Allonby!’ asked Thomas Idle.",
        "’I don’t see it yet,’ said Francis, looking out of window.",
        "’It must be there,’ said Thomas Idle.",
        "’I don’t see it,’ returned Francis.",
        "’It must be there,’ repeated Thomas Idle, fretfully.",
        "’Lord bless me!’ exclaimed Francis, drawing in his head, ’I suppose\nthis is it!’",
        "’A watering-place,’ retorted Thomas Idle, with the pardonable\nsharpness of an invalid, ’can’t be five gentlemen in straw hats, on\na form on one side of a door, and four ladies in hats and falls, on\na form on another side of a door, and three geese in a dirty little\nbrook before them, and a boy’s legs hanging over a bridge (with a\nboy’s body I suppose on the other side of the parapet), and a\ndonkey running away.  What are you talking about?’",
        "’Allonby, gentlemen,’ said the most comfortable of landladies as\nshe opened one door of the carriage; ’Allonby, gentlemen,’ said the\nmost attentive of landlords, as he opened the other.",
        "Thomas Idle yielded his arm to the ready Goodchild, and descended\nfrom the vehicle.  Thomas, now just able to grope his way along, in\na doubled-up condition, with the aid of two thick sticks, was no\nbad embodiment of Commodore Trunnion, or of one of those many\ngallant Admirals of the stage, who have all ample fortunes, gout,\nthick sticks, tempers, wards, and nephews.  With this distinguished\nnaval appearance upon him, Thomas made a crab-like progress up a\nclean little bulk-headed staircase, into a clean little bulk-headed\nroom, where he slowly deposited himself on a sofa, with a stick on\neither hand of him, looking exceedingly grim.",
        "’Francis,’ said Thomas Idle, ’what do you think of this place?’",
        "’I think,’ returned Mr. Goodchild, in a glowing way, ’it is\neverything we expected.’",
        "’Hah!’ said Thomas Idle.",
        "’There is the sea,’ cried Mr. Goodchild, pointing out of window;\n’and here,’ pointing to the lunch on the table, ’are shrimps.  Let\nus - ’ here Mr. Goodchild looked out of window, as if in search of\nsomething, and looked in again, - ’let us eat ’em.’",
        "The shrimps eaten and the dinner ordered, Mr. Goodchild went out to\nsurvey the watering-place.  As Chorus of the Drama, without whom\nThomas could make nothing of the scenery, he by-and-by returned, to\nhave the following report screwed out of him.",
        "In brief, it was the most delightful place ever seen.",
        "’But,’ Thomas Idle asked, ’where is it?’",
        "’It’s what you may call generally up and down the beach, here and\nthere,’ said Mr. Goodchild, with a twist of his hand.",
        "’Proceed,’ said Thomas Idle.",
        "It was, Mr. Goodchild went on to say, in cross-examination, what\nyou might call a primitive place.  Large?  No, it was not large.\nWho ever expected it would be large?  Shape?  What a question to\nask!  No shape.  What sort of a street?  Why, no street.  Shops?\nYes, of course (quite indignant).  How many?  Who ever went into a\nplace to count the shops?  Ever so many.  Six?  Perhaps.  A\nlibrary?  Why, of course (indignant again).  Good collection of\nbooks?  Most likely - couldn’t say - had seen nothing in it but a\npair of scales.  Any reading-room?  Of course, there was a reading-\nroom.  Where?  Where! why, over there.  Where was over there?  Why,\nTHERE!  Let Mr. Idle carry his eye to that bit of waste ground\nabove high-water mark, where the rank grass and loose stones were\nmost in a litter; and he would see a sort of long, ruinous brick\nloft, next door to a ruinous brick out-house, which loft had a\nladder outside, to get up by.  That was the reading-room, and if\nMr. Idle didn’t like the idea of a weaver’s shuttle throbbing under\na reading-room, that was his look out.  HE was not to dictate, Mr.\nGoodchild supposed (indignant again), to the company.",
        "’By-the-by,’ Thomas Idle observed; ’the company?’",
        "Well! (Mr. Goodchild went on to report) very nice company.  Where\nwere they?  Why, there they were.  Mr. Idle could see the tops of\ntheir hats, he supposed.  What?  Those nine straw hats again, five\ngentlemen’s and four ladies’?  Yes, to be sure.  Mr. Goodchild\nhoped the company were not to be expected to wear helmets, to\nplease Mr. Idle.",
        "Beginning to recover his temper at about this point, Mr. Goodchild\nvoluntarily reported that if you wanted to be primitive, you could\nbe primitive here, and that if you wanted to be idle, you could be\nidle here.  In the course of some days, he added, that there were\nthree fishing-boats, but no rigging, and that there were plenty of\nfishermen who never fished.  That they got their living entirely by\nlooking at the ocean.  What nourishment they looked out of it to\nsupport their strength, he couldn’t say; but, he supposed it was\nsome sort of Iodine.  The place was full of their children, who\nwere always upside down on the public buildings (two small bridges\nover the brook), and always hurting themselves or one another, so\nthat their wailings made more continual noise in the air than could\nhave been got in a busy place.  The houses people lodged in, were\nnowhere in particular, and were in capital accordance with the\nbeach; being all more or less cracked and damaged as its shells\nwere, and all empty - as its shells were.  Among them, was an\nedifice of destitute appearance, with a number of wall-eyed windows\nin it, looking desperately out to Scotland as if for help, which\nsaid it was a Bazaar (and it ought to know), and where you might\nbuy anything you wanted - supposing what you wanted, was a little\ncamp-stool or a child’s wheelbarrow.  The brook crawled or stopped\nbetween the houses and the sea, and the donkey was always running\naway, and when he got into the brook he was pelted out with stones,\nwhich never hit him, and which always hit some of the children who\nwere upside down on the public buildings, and made their\nlamentations louder.  This donkey was the public excitement of\nAllonby, and was probably supported at the public expense.",
        "The foregoing descriptions, delivered in separate items, on\nseparate days of adventurous discovery, Mr. Goodchild severally\nwound up, by looking out of window, looking in again, and saying,\n’But there is the sea, and here are the shrimps - let us eat ’em.’",
        "There were fine sunsets at Allonby when the low flat beach, with\nits pools of water and its dry patches, changed into long bars of\nsilver and gold in various states of burnishing, and there were\nfine views - on fine days - of the Scottish coast.  But, when it\nrained at Allonby, Allonby thrown back upon its ragged self, became\na kind of place which the donkey seemed to have found out, and to\nhave his highly sagacious reasons for wishing to bolt from.  Thomas\nIdle observed, too, that Mr. Goodchild, with a noble show of\ndisinterestedness, became every day more ready to walk to Maryport\nand back, for letters; and suspicions began to harbour in the mind\nof Thomas, that his friend deceived him, and that Maryport was a\npreferable place.",
        "Therefore, Thomas said to Francis on a day when they had looked at\nthe sea and eaten the shrimps, ’My mind misgives me, Goodchild,\nthat you go to Maryport, like the boy in the story-book, to ask IT\nto be idle with you.’",
        "’Judge, then,’ returned Francis, adopting the style of the story-\nbook, ’with what success.  I go to a region which is a bit of\nwater-side Bristol, with a slice of Wapping, a seasoning of\nWolverhampton, and a garnish of Portsmouth, and I say, “Will YOU\ncome and be idle with me?”  And it answers, “No; for I am a great\ndeal too vaporous, and a great deal too rusty, and a great deal too\nmuddy, and a great deal too dirty altogether; and I have ships to\nload, and pitch and tar to boil, and iron to hammer, and steam to\nget up, and smoke to make, and stone to quarry, and fifty other\ndisagreeable things to do, and I can’t be idle with you.”  Then I\ngo into jagged up-hill and down-hill streets, where I am in the\npastrycook’s shop at one moment, and next moment in savage\nfastnesses of moor and morass, beyond the confines of civilisation,\nand I say to those murky and black-dusty streets, “Will YOU come\nand be idle with me?”  To which they reply, “No, we can’t, indeed,\nfor we haven’t the spirits, and we are startled by the echo of your\nfeet on the sharp pavement, and we have so many goods in our shop-\nwindows which nobody wants, and we have so much to do for a limited\npublic which never comes to us to be done for, that we are\naltogether out of sorts and can’t enjoy ourselves with any one.\"\nSo I go to the Post-office, and knock at the shutter, and I say to\nthe Post-master, “Will YOU come and be idle with me?”  To which he\nrejoins, “No, I really can’t, for I live, as you may see, in such a\nvery little Post-office, and pass my life behind such a very little\nshutter, that my hand, when I put it out, is as the hand of a giant\ncrammed through the window of a dwarf’s house at a fair, and I am a\nmere Post-office anchorite in a cell much too small for him, and I\ncan’t get out, and I can’t get in, and I have no space to be idle\nin, even if I would.”  So, the boy,’ said Mr. Goodchild, concluding\nthe tale, ’comes back with the letters after all, and lives happy\nnever afterwards.’",
        "But it may, not unreasonably, be asked - while Francis Goodchild\nwas wandering hither and thither, storing his mind with perpetual\nobservation of men and things, and sincerely believing himself to\nbe the laziest creature in existence all the time - how did Thomas\nIdle, crippled and confined to the house, contrive to get through\nthe hours of the day?",
        "Prone on the sofa, Thomas made no attempt to get through the hours,\nbut passively allowed the hours to get through HIM.  Where other\nmen in his situation would have read books and improved their\nminds, Thomas slept and rested his body.  Where other men would\nhave pondered anxiously over their future prospects, Thomas dreamed\nlazily of his past life.  The one solitary thing he did, which most\nother people would have done in his place, was to resolve on making\ncertain alterations and improvements in his mode of existence, as\nsoon as the effects of the misfortune that had overtaken him had\nall passed away.  Remembering that the current of his life had\nhitherto oozed along in one smooth stream of laziness, occasionally\ntroubled on the surface by a slight passing ripple of industry, his\npresent ideas on the subject of self-reform, inclined him - not as\nthe reader may be disposed to imagine, to project schemes for a new\nexistence of enterprise and exertion - but, on the contrary, to\nresolve that he would never, if he could possibly help it, be\nactive or industrious again, throughout the whole of his future\ncareer.",
        "It is due to Mr. Idle to relate that his mind sauntered towards\nthis peculiar conclusion on distinct and logically-producible\ngrounds.  After reviewing, quite at his ease, and with many needful\nintervals of repose, the generally-placid spectacle of his past\nexistence, he arrived at the discovery that all the great disasters\nwhich had tried his patience and equanimity in early life, had been\ncaused by his having allowed himself to be deluded into imitating\nsome pernicious example of activity and industry that had been set\nhim by others.  The trials to which he here alludes were three in\nnumber, and may be thus reckoned up:  First, the disaster of being\nan unpopular and a thrashed boy at school; secondly, the disaster\nof falling seriously ill; thirdly, the disaster of becoming\nacquainted with a great bore.",
        "The first disaster occurred after Thomas had been an idle and a\npopular boy at school, for some happy years.  One Christmas-time,\nhe was stimulated by the evil example of a companion, whom he had\nalways trusted and liked, to be untrue to himself, and to try for a\nprize at the ensuing half-yearly examination.  He did try, and he\ngot a prize - how, he did not distinctly know at the moment, and\ncannot remember now.  No sooner, however, had the book - Moral\nHints to the Young on the Value of Time - been placed in his hands,\nthan the first troubles of his life began.  The idle boys deserted\nhim, as a traitor to their cause.  The industrious boys avoided\nhim, as a dangerous interloper; one of their number, who had always\nwon the prize on previous occasions, expressing just resentment at\nthe invasion of his privileges by calling Thomas into the play-\nground, and then and there administering to him the first sound and\ngenuine thrashing that he had ever received in his life.  Unpopular\nfrom that moment, as a beaten boy, who belonged to no side and was\nrejected by all parties, young Idle soon lost caste with his\nmasters, as he had previously lost caste with his schoolfellows.\nHe had forfeited the comfortable reputation of being the one lazy\nmember of the youthful community whom it was quite hopeless to\npunish.  Never again did he hear the headmaster say reproachfully\nto an industrious boy who had committed a fault, ’I might have\nexpected this in Thomas Idle, but it is inexcusable, sir, in you,\nwho know better.’  Never more, after winning that fatal prize, did\nhe escape the retributive imposition, or the avenging birch.  From\nthat time, the masters made him work, and the boys would not let\nhim play.  From that time his social position steadily declined,\nand his life at school became a perpetual burden to him.",
        "So, again, with the second disaster.  While Thomas was lazy, he was\na model of health.  His first attempt at active exertion and his\nfirst suffering from severe illness are connected together by the\nintimate relations of cause and effect.  Shortly after leaving\nschool, he accompanied a party of friends to a cricket-field, in\nhis natural and appropriate character of spectator only.  On the\nground it was discovered that the players fell short of the\nrequired number, and facile Thomas was persuaded to assist in\nmaking up the complement.  At a certain appointed time, he was\nroused from peaceful slumber in a dry ditch, and placed before\nthree wickets with a bat in his hand.  Opposite to him, behind\nthree more wickets, stood one of his bosom friends, filling the\nsituation (as he was informed) of bowler.  No words can describe\nMr. Idle’s horror and amazement, when he saw this young man - on\nordinary occasions, the meekest and mildest of human beings -\nsuddenly contract his eye-brows, compress his lips, assume the\naspect of an infuriated savage, run back a few steps, then run\nforward, and, without the slightest previous provocation, hurl a\ndetestably hard ball with all his might straight at Thomas’s legs.\nStimulated to preternatural activity of body and sharpness of eye\nby the instinct of self-preservation, Mr. Idle contrived, by\njumping deftly aside at the right moment, and by using his bat\n(ridiculously narrow as it was for the purpose) as a shield, to\npreserve his life and limbs from the dastardly attack that had been\nmade on both, to leave the full force of the deadly missile to\nstrike his wicket instead of his leg; and to end the innings, so\nfar as his side was concerned, by being immediately bowled out.\nGrateful for his escape, he was about to return to the dry ditch,\nwhen he was peremptorily stopped, and told that the other side was\n’going in,’ and that he was expected to ’field.’  His conception of\nthe whole art and mystery of ’fielding,’ may be summed up in the\nthree words of serious advice which he privately administered to\nhimself on that trying occasion - avoid the ball.  Fortified by\nthis sound and salutary principle, he took his own course,\nimpervious alike to ridicule and abuse.  Whenever the ball came\nnear him, he thought of his shins, and got out of the way\nimmediately.  ’Catch it!’  ’Stop it!’  ’Pitch it up!’ were cries\nthat passed by him like the idle wind that he regarded not.  He\nducked under it, he jumped over it, he whisked himself away from it\non either side.  Never once, through the whole innings did he and\nthe ball come together on anything approaching to intimate terms.\nThe unnatural activity of body which was necessarily called forth\nfor the accomplishment of this result threw Thomas Idle, for the\nfirst time in his life, into a perspiration.  The perspiration, in\nconsequence of his want of practice in the management of that\nparticular result of bodily activity, was suddenly checked; the\ninevitable chill succeeded; and that, in its turn, was followed by\na fever.  For the first time since his birth, Mr. Idle found\nhimself confined to his bed for many weeks together, wasted and\nworn by a long illness, of which his own disastrous muscular\nexertion had been the sole first cause.",
        "The third occasion on which Thomas found reason to reproach himself\nbitterly for the mistake of having attempted to be industrious, was\nconnected with his choice of a calling in life.  Having no interest\nin the Church, he appropriately selected the next best profession\nfor a lazy man in England - the Bar.  Although the Benchers of the\nInns of Court have lately abandoned their good old principles, and\noblige their students to make some show of studying, in Mr. Idle’s\ntime no such innovation as this existed.  Young men who aspired to\nthe honourable title of barrister were, very properly, not asked to\nlearn anything of the law, but were merely required to eat a\ncertain number of dinners at the table of their Hall, and to pay a\ncertain sum of money; and were called to the Bar as soon as they\ncould prove that they had sufficiently complied with these\nextremely sensible regulations.  Never did Thomas move more\nharmoniously in concert with his elders and betters than when he\nwas qualifying himself for admission among the barristers of his\nnative country.  Never did he feel more deeply what real laziness\nwas in all the serene majesty of its nature, than on the memorable\nday when he was called to the Bar, after having carefully abstained\nfrom opening his law-books during his period of probation, except\nto fall asleep over them.  How he could ever again have become\nindustrious, even for the shortest period, after that great reward\nconferred upon his idleness, quite passes his comprehension.  The\nkind Benchers did everything they could to show him the folly of\nexerting himself.  They wrote out his probationary exercise for\nhim, and never expected him even to take the trouble of reading it\nthrough when it was written.  They invited him, with seven other\nchoice spirits as lazy as himself, to come and be called to the\nBar, while they were sitting over their wine and fruit after\ndinner.  They put his oaths of allegiance, and his dreadful\nofficial denunciations of the Pope and the Pretender, so gently\ninto his mouth, that he hardly knew how the words got there.  They\nwheeled all their chairs softly round from the table, and sat\nsurveying the young barristers with their backs to their bottles,\nrather than stand up, or adjourn to hear the exercises read.  And\nwhen Mr. Idle and the seven unlabouring neophytes, ranged in order,\nas a class, with their backs considerately placed against a screen,\nhad begun, in rotation, to read the exercises which they had not\nwritten, even then, each Bencher, true to the great lazy principle\nof the whole proceeding, stopped each neophyte before he had\nstammered through his first line, and bowed to him, and told him\npolitely that he was a barrister from that moment.  This was all\nthe ceremony.  It was followed by a social supper, and by the\npresentation, in accordance with ancient custom, of a pound of\nsweetmeats and a bottle of Madeira, offered in the way of needful\nrefreshment, by each grateful neophyte to each beneficent Bencher.\nIt may seem inconceivable that Thomas should ever have forgotten\nthe great do-nothing principle instilled by such a ceremony as\nthis; but it is, nevertheless, true, that certain designing\nstudents of industrious habits found him out, took advantage of his\neasy humour, persuaded him that it was discreditable to be a\nbarrister and to know nothing whatever about the law, and lured\nhim, by the force of their own evil example, into a conveyancer’s\nchambers, to make up for lost time, and to qualify himself for\npractice at the Bar.  After a fortnight of self-delusion, the\ncurtain fell from his eyes; he resumed his natural character, and\nshut up his books.  But the retribution which had hitherto always\nfollowed his little casual errors of industry followed them still.\nHe could get away from the conveyancer’s chambers, but he could not\nget away from one of the pupils, who had taken a fancy to him, - a\ntall, serious, raw-boned, hard-working, disputatious pupil, with\nideas of his own about reforming the Law of Real Property, who has\nbeen the scourge of Mr. Idle’s existence ever since the fatal day\nwhen he fell into the mistake of attempting to study the law.\nBefore that time his friends were all sociable idlers like himself.\nSince that time the burden of bearing with a hard-working young man\nhas become part of his lot in life.  Go where he will now, he can\nnever feel certain that the raw-boned pupil is not affectionately\nwaiting for him round a corner, to tell him a little more about the\nLaw of Real Property.  Suffer as he may under the infliction, he\ncan never complain, for he must always remember, with unavailing\nregret, that he has his own thoughtless industry to thank for first\nexposing him to the great social calamity of knowing a bore.",
        "These events of his past life, with the significant results that\nthey brought about, pass drowsily through Thomas Idle’s memory,\nwhile he lies alone on the sofa at Allonby and elsewhere, dreaming\naway the time which his fellow-apprentice gets through so actively\nout of doors.  Remembering the lesson of laziness which his past\ndisasters teach, and bearing in mind also the fact that he is\ncrippled in one leg because he exerted himself to go up a mountain,\nwhen he ought to have known that his proper course of conduct was\nto stop at the bottom of it, he holds now, and will for the future\nfirmly continue to hold, by his new resolution never to be\nindustrious again, on any pretence whatever, for the rest of his\nlife.  The physical results of his accident have been related in a\nprevious chapter.  The moral results now stand on record; and, with\nthe enumeration of these, that part of the present narrative which\nis occupied by the Episode of The Sprained Ankle may now perhaps be\nconsidered, in all its aspects, as finished and complete.",
        "’How do you propose that we get through this present afternoon and\nevening?’ demanded Thomas Idle, after two or three hours of the\nforegoing reflections at Allonby.",
        "Mr. Goodchild faltered, looked out of window, looked in again, and\nsaid, as he had so often said before, ’There is the sea, and here\nare the shrimps; - let us eat ’em’!’",
        "But, the wise donkey was at that moment in the act of bolting:  not\nwith the irresolution of his previous efforts which had been\nwanting in sustained force of character, but with real vigour of\npurpose:  shaking the dust off his mane and hind-feet at Allonby,\nand tearing away from it, as if he had nobly made up his mind that\nhe never would be taken alive.  At sight of this inspiring\nspectacle, which was visible from his sofa, Thomas Idle stretched\nhis neck and dwelt upon it rapturously.",
        "’Francis Goodchild,’ he then said, turning to his companion with a\nsolemn air, ’this is a delightful little Inn, excellently kept by\nthe most comfortable of landladies and the most attentive of\nlandlords, but - the donkey’s right!’",
        "The words, ’There is the sea, and here are the - ’ again trembled\non the lips of Goodchild, unaccompanied however by any sound.",
        "’Let us instantly pack the portmanteaus,’ said Thomas Idle, ’pay\nthe bill, and order a fly out, with instructions to the driver to\nfollow the donkey!’",
        "Mr. Goodchild, who had only wanted encouragement to disclose the\nreal state of his feelings, and who had been pining beneath his\nweary secret, now burst into tears, and confessed that he thought\nanother day in the place would be the death of him.",
        "So, the two idle apprentices followed the donkey until the night\nwas far advanced.  Whether he was recaptured by the town-council,\nor is bolting at this hour through the United Kingdom, they know\nnot.  They hope he may be still bolting; if so, their best wishes\nare with him.",
        "It entered Mr. Idle’s head, on the borders of Cumberland, that\nthere could be no idler place to stay at, except by snatches of a\nfew minutes each, than a railway station.  ’An intermediate station\non a line - a junction - anything of that sort,’ Thomas suggested.\nMr. Goodchild approved of the idea as eccentric, and they journeyed\non and on, until they came to such a station where there was an\nInn.",
        "’Here,’ said Thomas, ’we may be luxuriously lazy; other people will\ntravel for us, as it were, and we shall laugh at their folly.’",
        "It was a Junction-Station, where the wooden razors before mentioned\nshaved the air very often, and where the sharp electric-telegraph\nbell was in a very restless condition.  All manner of cross-lines\nof rails came zig-zagging into it, like a Congress of iron vipers;\nand, a little way out of it, a pointsman in an elevated signal-box\nwas constantly going through the motions of drawing immense\nquantities of beer at a public-house bar.  In one direction,\nconfused perspectives of embankments and arches were to be seen\nfrom the platform; in the other, the rails soon disentangled\nthemselves into two tracks and shot away under a bridge, and curved\nround a corner.  Sidings were there, in which empty luggage-vans\nand cattle-boxes often butted against each other as if they\ncouldn’t agree; and warehouses were there, in which great\nquantities of goods seemed to have taken the veil (of the\nconsistency of tarpaulin), and to have retired from the world\nwithout any hope of getting back to it.  Refreshment-rooms were\nthere; one, for the hungry and thirsty Iron Locomotives where their\ncoke and water were ready, and of good quality, for they were\ndangerous to play tricks with; the other, for the hungry and\nthirsty human Locomotives, who might take what they could get, and\nwhose chief consolation was provided in the form of three terrific\nurns or vases of white metal, containing nothing, each forming a\nbreastwork for a defiant and apparently much-injured woman.",
        "Established at this Station, Mr. Thomas Idle and Mr. Francis\nGoodchild resolved to enjoy it.  But, its contrasts were very\nviolent, and there was also an infection in it.",
        "First, as to its contrasts.  They were only two, but they were\nLethargy and Madness.  The Station was either totally unconscious,\nor wildly raving.  By day, in its unconscious state, it looked as\nif no life could come to it, - as if it were all rust, dust, and\nashes - as if the last train for ever, had gone without issuing any\nReturn-Tickets - as if the last Engine had uttered its last shriek\nand burst.  One awkward shave of the air from the wooden razor, and\neverything changed.  Tight office-doors flew open, panels yielded,\nbooks, newspapers, travelling-caps and wrappers broke out of brick\nwalls, money chinked, conveyances oppressed by nightmares of\nluggage came careering into the yard, porters started up from\nsecret places, ditto the much-injured women, the shining bell, who\nlived in a little tray on stilts by himself, flew into a man’s hand\nand clamoured violently.  The pointsman aloft in the signal-box\nmade the motions of drawing, with some difficulty, hogsheads of\nbeer.  Down Train!  More bear!  Up Train!  More beer.  Cross\njunction Train!  More beer!  Cattle Train!  More beer.  Goods\nTrain!  Simmering, whistling, trembling, rumbling, thundering.\nTrains on the whole confusion of intersecting rails, crossing one\nanother, bumping one another, hissing one another, backing to go\nforward, tearing into distance to come close.  People frantic.\nExiles seeking restoration to their native carriages, and banished\nto remoter climes.  More beer and more bell.  Then, in a minute,\nthe Station relapsed into stupor as the stoker of the Cattle Train,\nthe last to depart, went gliding out of it, wiping the long nose of\nhis oil-can with a dirty pocket-handkerchief.",
        "By night, in its unconscious state, the Station was not so much as\nvisible.  Something in the air, like an enterprising chemist’s\nestablished in business on one of the boughs of Jack’s beanstalk,\nwas all that could be discerned of it under the stars.  In a moment\nit would break out, a constellation of gas.  In another moment,\ntwenty rival chemists, on twenty rival beanstalks, came into\nexistence.  Then, the Furies would be seen, waving their lurid\ntorches up and down the confused perspectives of embankments and\narches - would be heard, too, wailing and shrieking.  Then, the\nStation would be full of palpitating trains, as in the day; with\nthe heightening difference that they were not so clearly seen as in\nthe day, whereas the Station walls, starting forward under the gas,\nlike a hippopotamus’s eyes, dazzled the human locomotives with the\nsauce-bottle, the cheap music, the bedstead, the distorted range of\nbuildings where the patent safes are made, the gentleman in the\nrain with the registered umbrella, the lady returning from the ball\nwith the registered respirator, and all their other embellishments.\nAnd now, the human locomotives, creased as to their countenances\nand purblind as to their eyes, would swarm forth in a heap,\naddressing themselves to the mysterious urns and the much-injured\nwomen; while the iron locomotives, dripping fire and water, shed\ntheir steam about plentifully, making the dull oxen in their cages,\nwith heads depressed, and foam hanging from their mouths as their\nred looks glanced fearfully at the surrounding terrors, seem as\nthough they had been drinking at half-frozen waters and were hung\nwith icicles.  Through the same steam would be caught glimpses of\ntheir fellow-travellers, the sheep, getting their white kid faces\ntogether, away from the bars, and stuffing the interstices with\ntrembling wool.  Also, down among the wheels, of the man with the\nsledge-hammer, ringing the axles of the fast night-train; against\nwhom the oxen have a misgiving that he is the man with the pole-axe\nwho is to come by-and-by, and so the nearest of them try to get\nback, and get a purchase for a thrust at him through the bars.\nSuddenly, the bell would ring, the steam would stop with one hiss\nand a yell, the chemists on the beanstalks would be busy, the\navenging Furies would bestir themselves, the fast night-train would\nmelt from eye and ear, the other trains going their ways more\nslowly would be heard faintly rattling in the distance like old-\nfashioned watches running down, the sauce-bottle and cheap music\nretired from view, even the bedstead went to bed, and there was no\nsuch visible thing as the Station to vex the cool wind in its\nblowing, or perhaps the autumn lightning, as it found out the iron\nrails.",
        "The infection of the Station was this:- When it was in its raving\nstate, the Apprentices found it impossible to be there, without\nlabouring under the delusion that they were in a hurry.  To Mr.\nGoodchild, whose ideas of idleness were so imperfect, this was no\nunpleasant hallucination, and accordingly that gentleman went\nthrough great exertions in yielding to it, and running up and down\nthe platform, jostling everybody, under the impression that he had\na highly important mission somewhere, and had not a moment to lose.\nBut, to Thomas Idle, this contagion was so very unacceptable an\nincident of the situation, that he struck on the fourth day, and\nrequested to be moved.",
        "’This place fills me with a dreadful sensation,’ said Thomas, ’of\nhaving something to do.  Remove me, Francis.’",
        "’Where would you like to go next?’ was the question of the ever-\nengaging Goodchild.",
        "’I have heard there is a good old Inn at Lancaster, established in\na fine old house:  an Inn where they give you Bride-cake every day\nafter dinner,’ said Thomas Idle.  ’Let us eat Bride-cake without\nthe trouble of being married, or of knowing anybody in that\nridiculous dilemma.’",
        "Mr. Goodchild, with a lover’s sigh, assented.  They departed from\nthe Station in a violent hurry (for which, it is unnecessary to\nobserve, there was not the least occasion), and were delivered at\nthe fine old house at Lancaster, on the same night.",
        "It is Mr. Goodchild’s opinion, that if a visitor on his arrival at\nLancaster could be accommodated with a pole which would push the\nopposite side of the street some yards farther off, it would be\nbetter for all parties.  Protesting against being required to live\nin a trench, and obliged to speculate all day upon what the people\ncan possibly be doing within a mysterious opposite window, which is\na shop-window to look at, but not a shop-window in respect of its\noffering nothing for sale and declining to give any account\nwhatever of itself, Mr. Goodchild concedes Lancaster to be a\npleasant place.  A place dropped in the midst of a charming\nlandscape, a place with a fine ancient fragment of castle, a place\nof lovely walks, a place possessing staid old houses richly fitted\nwith old Honduras mahogany, which has grown so dark with time that\nit seems to have got something of a retrospective mirror-quality\ninto itself, and to show the visitor, in the depth of its grain,\nthrough all its polish, the hue of the wretched slaves who groaned\nlong ago under old Lancaster merchants.  And Mr. Goodchild adds\nthat the stones of Lancaster do sometimes whisper, even yet, of\nrich men passed away - upon whose great prosperity some of these\nold doorways frowned sullen in the brightest weather - that their\nslave-gain turned to curses, as the Arabian Wizard’s money turned\nto leaves, and that no good ever came of it, even unto the third\nand fourth generations, until it was wasted and gone.",
        "It was a gallant sight to behold, the Sunday procession of the\nLancaster elders to Church - all in black, and looking fearfully\nlike a funeral without the Body - under the escort of Three\nBeadles.",
        "’Think,’ said Francis, as he stood at the Inn window, admiring, ’of\nbeing taken to the sacred edifice by three Beadles!  I have, in my\nearly time, been taken out of it by one Beadle; but, to be taken\ninto it by three, O Thomas, is a distinction I shall never enjoy!’",
        "When Mr. Goodchild had looked out of the Lancaster Inn window for\ntwo hours on end, with great perseverance, he begun to entertain a\nmisgiving that he was growing industrious.  He therefore set\nhimself next, to explore the country from the tops of all the steep\nhills in the neighbourhood.",
        "He came back at dinner-time, red and glowing, to tell Thomas Idle\nwhat he had seen.  Thomas, on his back reading, listened with great\ncomposure, and asked him whether he really had gone up those hills,\nand bothered himself with those views, and walked all those miles?",
        "’Because I want to know,’ added Thomas, ’what you would say of it,\nif you were obliged to do it?’",
        "’It would be different, then,’ said Francis.  ’It would be work,\nthen; now, it’s play.’",
        "’Play!’ replied Thomas Idle, utterly repudiating the reply.  ’Play!\nHere is a man goes systematically tearing himself to pieces, and\nputting himself through an incessant course of training, as if he\nwere always under articles to fight a match for the champion’s\nbelt, and he calls it Play!  Play!’ exclaimed Thomas Idle,\nscornfully contemplating his one boot in the air.  ’You CAN’T play.\nYou don’t know what it is.  You make work of everything.’",
        "The bright Goodchild amiably smiled.",
        "’So you do,’ said Thomas.  ’I mean it.  To me you are an absolutely\nterrible fellow.  You do nothing like another man.  Where another\nfellow would fall into a footbath of action or emotion, you fall\ninto a mine.  Where any other fellow would be a painted butterfly,\nyou are a fiery dragon.  Where another man would stake a sixpence,\nyou stake your existence.  If you were to go up in a balloon, you\nwould make for Heaven; and if you were to dive into the depths of\nthe earth, nothing short of the other place would content you.\nWhat a fellow you are, Francis!’  The cheerful Goodchild laughed.",
        "’It’s all very well to laugh, but I wonder you don’t feel it to be\nserious,’ said Idle.  ’A man who can do nothing by halves appears\nto me to be a fearful man.’",
        "’Tom, Tom,’ returned Goodchild, ’if I can do nothing by halves, and\nbe nothing by halves, it’s pretty clear that you must take me as a\nwhole, and make the best of me.’",
        "With this philosophical rejoinder, the airy Goodchild clapped Mr.\nIdle on the shoulder in a final manner, and they sat down to\ndinner.",
        "’By-the-by,’ said Goodchild, ’I have been over a lunatic asylum\ntoo, since I have been out.’",
        "’He has been,’ exclaimed Thomas Idle, casting up his eyes, ’over a\nlunatic asylum!  Not content with being as great an Ass as Captain\nBarclay in the pedestrian way, he makes a Lunacy Commissioner of\nhimself - for nothing!’",
        "’An immense place,’ said Goodchild, ’admirable offices, very good\narrangements, very good attendants; altogether a remarkable place.’",
        "’And what did you see there?’ asked Mr. Idle, adapting Hamlet’s\nadvice to the occasion, and assuming the virtue of interest, though\nhe had it not.",
        "’The usual thing,’ said Francis Goodchild, with a sigh.  ’Long\ngroves of blighted men-and-women-trees; interminable avenues of\nhopeless faces; numbers, without the slightest power of really\ncombining for any earthly purpose; a society of human creatures who\nhave nothing in common but that they have all lost the power of\nbeing humanly social with one another.’",
        "’Take a glass of wine with me,’ said Thomas Idle, ’and let US be\nsocial.’",
        "’In one gallery, Tom,’ pursued Francis Goodchild, ’which looked to\nme about the length of the Long Walk at Windsor, more or less - ’",
        "’Probably less,’ observed Thomas Idle.",
        "’In one gallery, which was otherwise clear of patients (for they\nwere all out), there was a poor little dark-chinned, meagre man,\nwith a perplexed brow and a pensive face, stooping low over the\nmatting on the floor, and picking out with his thumb and forefinger\nthe course of its fibres.  The afternoon sun was slanting in at the\nlarge end-window, and there were cross patches of light and shade\nall down the vista, made by the unseen windows and the open doors\nof the little sleeping-cells on either side.  In about the centre\nof the perspective, under an arch, regardless of the pleasant\nweather, regardless of the solitude, regardless of approaching\nfootsteps, was the poor little dark-chinned, meagre man, poring\nover the matting.  “What are you doing there?” said my conductor,\nwhen we came to him.  He looked up, and pointed to the matting.  “I\nwouldn’t do that, I think,” said my conductor, kindly; “if I were\nyou, I would go and read, or I would lie down if I felt tired; but\nI wouldn’t do that.”  The patient considered a moment, and vacantly\nanswered, “No, sir, I won’t; I’ll - I’ll go and read,” and so he\nlamely shuffled away into one of the little rooms.  I turned my\nhead before we had gone many paces.  He had already come out again,\nand was again poring over the matting, and tracking out its fibres\nwith his thumb and forefinger.  I stopped to look at him, and it\ncame into my mind, that probably the course of those fibres as they\nplaited in and out, over and under, was the only course of things\nin the whole wide world that it was left to him to understand -\nthat his darkening intellect had narrowed down to the small cleft\nof light which showed him, “This piece was twisted this way, went\nin here, passed under, came out there, was carried on away here to\nthe right where I now put my finger on it, and in this progress of\nevents, the thing was made and came to be here.”  Then, I wondered\nwhether he looked into the matting, next, to see if it could show\nhim anything of the process through which HE came to be there, so\nstrangely poring over it.  Then, I thought how all of us, GOD help\nus! in our different ways are poring over our bits of matting,\nblindly enough, and what confusions and mysteries we make in the\npattern.  I had a sadder fellow-feeling with the little dark-\nchinned, meagre man, by that time, and I came away.’",
        "Mr. Idle diverting the conversation to grouse, custards, and bride-\ncake, Mr. Goodchild followed in the same direction.  The bride-cake\nwas as bilious and indigestible as if a real Bride had cut it, and\nthe dinner it completed was an admirable performance.",
        "The house was a genuine old house of a very quaint description,\nteeming with old carvings, and beams, and panels, and having an\nexcellent old staircase, with a gallery or upper staircase, cut off\nfrom it by a curious fence-work of old oak, or of the old Honduras\nMahogany wood.  It was, and is, and will be, for many a long year\nto come, a remarkably picturesque house; and a certain grave\nmystery lurking in the depth of the old mahogany panels, as if they\nwere so many deep pools of dark water - such, indeed, as they had\nbeen much among when they were trees - gave it a very mysterious\ncharacter after nightfall.",
        "When Mr. Goodchild and Mr. Idle had first alighted at the door, and\nstepped into the sombre, handsome old hall, they had been received\nby half-a-dozen noiseless old men in black, all dressed exactly\nalike, who glided up the stairs with the obliging landlord and\nwaiter - but without appearing to get into their way, or to mind\nwhether they did or no - and who had filed off to the right and\nleft on the old staircase, as the guests entered their sitting-\nroom.  It was then broad, bright day.  But, Mr. Goodchild had said,\nwhen their door was shut, ’Who on earth are those old men?’  And\nafterwards, both on going out and coming in, he had noticed that\nthere were no old men to be seen.",
        "Neither, had the old men, or any one of the old men, reappeared\nsince.  The two friends had passed a night in the house, but had\nseen nothing more of the old men.  Mr. Goodchild, in rambling about\nit, had looked along passages, and glanced in at doorways, but had\nencountered no old men; neither did it appear that any old men\nwere, by any member of the establishment, missed or expected.",
        "Another odd circumstance impressed itself on their attention.  It\nwas, that the door of their sitting-room was never left untouched\nfor a quarter of an hour.  It was opened with hesitation, opened\nwith confidence, opened a little way, opened a good way, - always\nclapped-to again without a word of explanation.  They were reading,\nthey were writing, they were eating, they were drinking, they were\ntalking, they were dozing; the door was always opened at an\nunexpected moment, and they looked towards it, and it was clapped-\nto again, and nobody was to be seen.  When this had happened fifty\ntimes or so, Mr. Goodchild had said to his companion, jestingly:\n’I begin to think, Tom, there was something wrong with those six\nold men.’",
        "Night had come again, and they had been writing for two or three\nhours:  writing, in short, a portion of the lazy notes from which\nthese lazy sheets are taken.  They had left off writing, and\nglasses were on the table between them.  The house was closed and\nquiet.  Around the head of Thomas Idle, as he lay upon his sofa,\nhovered light wreaths of fragrant smoke.  The temples of Francis\nGoodchild, as he leaned back in his chair, with his two hands\nclasped behind his head, and his legs crossed, were similarly\ndecorated.",
        "They had been discussing several idle subjects of speculation, not\nomitting the strange old men, and were still so occupied, when Mr.\nGoodchild abruptly changed his attitude to wind up his watch.  They\nwere just becoming drowsy enough to be stopped in their talk by any\nsuch slight check.  Thomas Idle, who was speaking at the moment,\npaused and said, ’How goes it?’",
        "’One,’ said Goodchild.",
        "As if he had ordered One old man, and the order were promptly\nexecuted (truly, all orders were so, in that excellent hotel), the\ndoor opened, and One old man stood there.",
        "He did not come in, but stood with the door in his hand.",
        "’One of the six, Tom, at last!’ said Mr. Goodchild, in a surprised\nwhisper. - ’Sir, your pleasure?’",
        "’Sir, YOUR pleasure?’ said the One old man.",
        "’I didn’t ring.’",
        "’The bell did,’ said the One old man.",
        "He said BELL, in a deep, strong way, that would have expressed the\nchurch Bell.",
        "’I had the pleasure, I believe, of seeing you, yesterday?’ said\nGoodchild.",
        "’I cannot undertake to say for certain,’ was the grim reply of the\nOne old man.",
        "’I think you saw me?  Did you not?’",
        "’Saw YOU?’ said the old man.  ’O yes, I saw you.  But, I see many\nwho never see me.’",
        "A chilled, slow, earthy, fixed old man.  A cadaverous old man of\nmeasured speech.  An old man who seemed as unable to wink, as if\nhis eyelids had been nailed to his forehead.  An old man whose eyes\n- two spots of fire - had no more motion than if they had been\nconnected with the back of his skull by screws driven through it,\nand rivetted and bolted outside, among his grey hair.",
        "The night had turned so cold, to Mr. Goodchild’s sensations, that\nhe shivered.  He remarked lightly, and half apologetically, ’I\nthink somebody is walking over my grave.’",
        "’No,’ said the weird old man, ’there is no one there.’",
        "Mr. Goodchild looked at Idle, but Idle lay with his head enwreathed\nin smoke.",
        "’No one there?’ said Goodchild.",
        "’There is no one at your grave, I assure you,’ said the old man.",
        "He had come in and shut the door, and he now sat down.  He did not\nbend himself to sit, as other people do, but seemed to sink bolt\nupright, as if in water, until the chair stopped him.",
        "’My friend, Mr. Idle,’ said Goodchild, extremely anxious to\nintroduce a third person into the conversation.",
        "’I am,’ said the old man, without looking at him, ’at Mr. Idle’s\nservice.’",
        "’If you are an old inhabitant of this place,’ Francis Goodchild\nresumed.",
        "’Yes.’",
        "’Perhaps you can decide a point my friend and I were in doubt upon,\nthis morning.  They hang condemned criminals at the Castle, I\nbelieve?’",
        "’I believe so,’ said the old man.",
        "’Are their faces turned towards that noble prospect?’",
        "’Your face is turned,’ replied the old man, ’to the Castle wall.\nWhen you are tied up, you see its stones expanding and contracting\nviolently, and a similar expansion and contraction seem to take\nplace in your own head and breast.  Then, there is a rush of fire\nand an earthquake, and the Castle springs into the air, and you\ntumble down a precipice.’",
        "His cravat appeared to trouble him.  He put his hand to his throat,\nand moved his neck from side to side.  He was an old man of a\nswollen character of face, and his nose was immoveably hitched up\non one side, as if by a little hook inserted in that nostril.  Mr.\nGoodchild felt exceedingly uncomfortable, and began to think the\nnight was hot, and not cold.",
        "’A strong description, sir,’ he observed.",
        "’A strong sensation,’ the old man rejoined.",
        "Again, Mr. Goodchild looked to Mr. Thomas Idle; but Thomas lay on\nhis back with his face attentively turned towards the One old man,\nand made no sign.  At this time Mr. Goodchild believed that he saw\nthreads of fire stretch from the old man’s eyes to his own, and\nthere attach themselves.  (Mr.  Goodchild writes the present\naccount of his experience, and, with the utmost solemnity, protests\nthat he had the strongest sensation upon him of being forced to\nlook at the old man along those two fiery films, from that moment.)",
        "’I must tell it to you,’ said the old man, with a ghastly and a\nstony stare.",
        "’What?’ asked Francis Goodchild.",
        "’You know where it took place.  Yonder!’",
        "Whether he pointed to the room above, or to the room below, or to\nany room in that old house, or to a room in some other old house in\nthat old town, Mr. Goodchild was not, nor is, nor ever can be,\nsure.  He was confused by the circumstance that the right\nforefinger of the One old man seemed to dip itself in one of the\nthreads of fire, light itself, and make a fiery start in the air,\nas it pointed somewhere.  Having pointed somewhere, it went out.",
        "’You know she was a Bride,’ said the old man.",
        "’I know they still send up Bride-cake,’ Mr. Goodchild faltered.\n’This is a very oppressive air.’",
        "’She was a Bride,’ said the old man.  ’She was a fair, flaxen-\nhaired, large-eyed girl, who had no character, no purpose.  A weak,\ncredulous, incapable, helpless nothing.  Not like her mother.  No,\nno.  It was her father whose character she reflected.",
        "’Her mother had taken care to secure everything to herself, for her\nown life, when the father of this girl (a child at that time) died\n- of sheer helplessness; no other disorder - and then He renewed\nthe acquaintance that had once subsisted between the mother and\nHim.  He had been put aside for the flaxen-haired, large-eyed man\n(or nonentity) with Money.  He could overlook that for Money.  He\nwanted compensation in Money.",
        "’So, he returned to the side of that woman the mother, made love to\nher again, danced attendance on her, and submitted himself to her\nwhims.  She wreaked upon him every whim she had, or could invent.\nHe bore it.  And the more he bore, the more he wanted compensation\nin Money, and the more he was resolved to have it.",
        "’But, lo!  Before he got it, she cheated him.  In one of her\nimperious states, she froze, and never thawed again.  She put her\nhands to her head one night, uttered a cry, stiffened, lay in that\nattitude certain hours, and died.  And he had got no compensation\nfrom her in Money, yet.  Blight and Murrain on her!  Not a penny.",
        "’He had hated her throughout that second pursuit, and had longed\nfor retaliation on her.  He now counterfeited her signature to an\ninstrument, leaving all she had to leave, to her daughter - ten\nyears old then - to whom the property passed absolutely, and\nappointing himself the daughter’s Guardian.  When He slid it under\nthe pillow of the bed on which she lay, He bent down in the deaf\near of Death, and whispered:  “Mistress Pride, I have determined a\nlong time that, dead or alive, you must make me compensation in\nMoney.’",
        "’So, now there were only two left.  Which two were, He, and the\nfair flaxen-haired, large-eyed foolish daughter, who afterwards\nbecame the Bride.",
        "’He put her to school.  In a secret, dark, oppressive, ancient\nhouse, he put her to school with a watchful and unscrupulous woman.\n\"My worthy lady,” he said, “here is a mind to be formed; will you\nhelp me to form it?”  She accepted the trust.  For which she, too,\nwanted compensation in Money, and had it.",
        "’The girl was formed in the fear of him, and in the conviction,\nthat there was no escape from him.  She was taught, from the first,\nto regard him as her future husband - the man who must marry her -\nthe destiny that overshadowed her - the appointed certainty that\ncould never be evaded.  The poor fool was soft white wax in their\nhands, and took the impression that they put upon her.  It hardened\nwith time.  It became a part of herself.  Inseparable from herself,\nand only to be torn away from her, by tearing life away from her.",
        "’Eleven years she had lived in the dark house and its gloomy\ngarden.  He was jealous of the very light and air getting to her,\nand they kept her close.  He stopped the wide chimneys, shaded the\nlittle windows, left the strong-stemmed ivy to wander where it\nwould over the house-front, the moss to accumulate on the untrimmed\nfruit-trees in the red-walled garden, the weeds to over-run its\ngreen and yellow walks.  He surrounded her with images of sorrow\nand desolation.  He caused her to be filled with fears of the place\nand of the stories that were told of it, and then on pretext of\ncorrecting them, to be left in it in solitude, or made to shrink\nabout it in the dark.  When her mind was most depressed and fullest\nof terrors, then, he would come out of one of the hiding-places\nfrom which he overlooked her, and present himself as her sole\nresource.",
        "’Thus, by being from her childhood the one embodiment her life\npresented to her of power to coerce and power to relieve, power to\nbind and power to loose, the ascendency over her weakness was\nsecured.  She was twenty-one years and twenty-one days old, when he\nbrought her home to the gloomy house, his half-witted, frightened,\nand submissive Bride of three weeks.",
        "’He had dismissed the governess by that time - what he had left to\ndo, he could best do alone - and they came back, upon a rain night,\nto the scene of her long preparation.  She turned to him upon the\nthreshold, as the rain was dripping from the porch, and said:",
        "’\"O sir, it is the Death-watch ticking for me!”",
        "’\"Well!” he answered.  “And if it were?”",
        "’\"O sir!” she returned to him, “look kindly on me, and be merciful\nto me!  I beg your pardon.  I will do anything you wish, if you\nwill only forgive me!”",
        "’That had become the poor fool’s constant song:  “I beg your\npardon,” and “Forgive me!”",
        "’She was not worth hating; he felt nothing but contempt for her.\nBut, she had long been in the way, and he had long been weary, and\nthe work was near its end, and had to be worked out.",
        "’\"You fool,” he said.  “Go up the stairs!”",
        "’She obeyed very quickly, murmuring, “I will do anything you wish!\"\nWhen he came into the Bride’s Chamber, having been a little\nretarded by the heavy fastenings of the great door (for they were\nalone in the house, and he had arranged that the people who\nattended on them should come and go in the day), he found her\nwithdrawn to the furthest corner, and there standing pressed\nagainst the paneling as if she would have shrunk through it:  her\nflaxen hair all wild about her face, and her large eyes staring at\nhim in vague terror.",
        "’\"What are you afraid of?  Come and sit down by me.”",
        "’\"I will do anything you wish.  I beg your pardon, sir.  Forgive\nme!”  Her monotonous tune as usual.",
        "’\"Ellen, here is a writing that you must write out to-morrow, in\nyour own hand.  You may as well be seen by others, busily engaged\nupon it.  When you have written it all fairly, and corrected all\nmistakes, call in any two people there may be about the house, and\nsign your name to it before them.  Then, put it in your bosom to\nkeep it safe, and when I sit here again to-morrow night, give it to\nme.”",
        "’\"I will do it all, with the greatest care.  I will do anything you\nwish.”",
        "’\"Don’t shake and tremble, then.”",
        "’\"I will try my utmost not to do it - if you will only forgive me!”",
        "’Next day, she sat down at her desk, and did as she had been told.\nHe often passed in and out of the room, to observe her, and always\nsaw her slowly and laboriously writing:  repeating to herself the\nwords she copied, in appearance quite mechanically, and without\ncaring or endeavouring to comprehend them, so that she did her\ntask.  He saw her follow the directions she had received, in all\nparticulars; and at night, when they were alone again in the same\nBride’s Chamber, and he drew his chair to the hearth, she timidly\napproached him from her distant seat, took the paper from her\nbosom, and gave it into his hand.",
        "’It secured all her possessions to him, in the event of her death.\nHe put her before him, face to face, that he might look at her\nsteadily; and he asked her, in so many plain words, neither fewer\nnor more, did she know that?",
        "’There were spots of ink upon the bosom of her white dress, and\nthey made her face look whiter and her eyes look larger as she\nnodded her head.  There were spots of ink upon the hand with which\nshe stood before him, nervously plaiting and folding her white\nskirts.",
        "’He took her by the arm, and looked her, yet more closely and\nsteadily, in the face.  “Now, die!  I have done with you.”",
        "’She shrunk, and uttered a low, suppressed cry.",
        "’\"I am not going to kill you.  I will not endanger my life for\nyours.  Die!”",
        "’He sat before her in the gloomy Bride’s Chamber, day after day,\nnight after night, looking the word at her when he did not utter\nit.  As often as her large unmeaning eyes were raised from the\nhands in which she rocked her head, to the stern figure, sitting\nwith crossed arms and knitted forehead, in the chair, they read in\nit, “Die!”  When she dropped asleep in exhaustion, she was called\nback to shuddering consciousness, by the whisper, “Die!”  When she\nfell upon her old entreaty to be pardoned, she was answered “Die!\"\nWhen she had out-watched and out-suffered the long night, and the\nrising sun flamed into the sombre room, she heard it hailed with,\n\"Another day and not dead? - Die!”",
        "’Shut up in the deserted mansion, aloof from all mankind, and\nengaged alone in such a struggle without any respite, it came to\nthis - that either he must die, or she.  He knew it very well, and\nconcentrated his strength against her feebleness.  Hours upon hours\nhe held her by the arm when her arm was black where he held it, and\nbade her Die!",
        "’It was done, upon a windy morning, before sunrise.  He computed\nthe time to be half-past four; but, his forgotten watch had run\ndown, and he could not be sure.  She had broken away from him in\nthe night, with loud and sudden cries - the first of that kind to\nwhich she had given vent - and he had had to put his hands over her\nmouth.  Since then, she had been quiet in the corner of the\npaneling where she had sunk down; and he had left her, and had gone\nback with his folded arms and his knitted forehead to his chair.",
        "’Paler in the pale light, more colourless than ever in the leaden\ndawn, he saw her coming, trailing herself along the floor towards\nhim - a white wreck of hair, and dress, and wild eyes, pushing\nitself on by an irresolute and bending hand.",

        "’\"Die!”",
        "’Her large eyes strained themselves with wonder and fear; wonder\nand fear changed to reproach; reproach to blank nothing.  It was\ndone.  He was not at first so sure it was done, but that the\nmorning sun was hanging jewels in her hair - he saw the diamond,\nemerald, and ruby, glittering among it in little points, as he\nstood looking down at her - when he lifted her and laid her on her\nbed.",
        "’She was soon laid in the ground.  And now they were all gone, and\nhe had compensated himself well.",
        "’He had a mind to travel.  Not that he meant to waste his Money,\nfor he was a pinching man and liked his Money dearly (liked nothing\nelse, indeed), but, that he had grown tired of the desolate house\nand wished to turn his back upon it and have done with it.  But,\nthe house was worth Money, and Money must not be thrown away.  He\ndetermined to sell it before he went.  That it might look the less\nwretched and bring a better price, he hired some labourers to work\nin the overgrown garden; to cut out the dead wood, trim the ivy\nthat drooped in heavy masses over the windows and gables, and clear\nthe walks in which the weeds were growing mid-leg high.",
        "’He worked, himself, along with them.  He worked later than they\ndid, and, one evening at dusk, was left working alone, with his\nbill-hook in his hand.  One autumn evening, when the Bride was five\nweeks dead.",
        "’\"It grows too dark to work longer,” he said to himself, “I must\ngive over for the night.”",
        "’He detested the house, and was loath to enter it.  He looked at\nthe dark porch waiting for him like a tomb, and felt that it was an\naccursed house.  Near to the porch, and near to where he stood, was\na tree whose branches waved before the old bay-window of the\nBride’s Chamber, where it had been done.  The tree swung suddenly,\nand made him start.  It swung again, although the night was still.\nLooking up into it, he saw a figure among the branches.",
        "’It was the figure of a young man.  The face looked down, as his\nlooked up; the branches cracked and swayed; the figure rapidly\ndescended, and slid upon its feet before him.  A slender youth of\nabout her age, with long light brown hair.",
        "’\"What thief are you?” he said, seizing the youth by the collar.",
        "’The young man, in shaking himself free, swung him a blow with his\narm across the face and throat.  They closed, but the young man got\nfrom him and stepped back, crying, with great eagerness and horror,\n\"Don’t touch me!  I would as lieve be touched by the Devil!”",
        "’He stood still, with his bill-hook in his hand, looking at the\nyoung man.  For, the young man’s look was the counterpart of her\nlast look, and he had not expected ever to see that again.",
        "’\"I am no thief.  Even if I were, I would not have a coin of your\nwealth, if it would buy me the Indies.  You murderer!”",
        "’\"What!”",
        "’\"I climbed it,” said the young man, pointing up into the tree,\n\"for the first time, nigh four years ago.  I climbed it, to look at\nher.  I saw her.  I spoke to her.  I have climbed it, many a time,\nto watch and listen for her.  I was a boy, hidden among its leaves,\nwhen from that bay-window she gave me this!”",
        "’He showed a tress of flaxen hair, tied with a mourning ribbon.",
        "’\"Her life,” said the young man, “was a life of mourning.  She gave\nme this, as a token of it, and a sign that she was dead to every\none but you.  If I had been older, if I had seen her sooner, I\nmight have saved her from you.  But, she was fast in the web when I\nfirst climbed the tree, and what could I do then to break it!”",
        "’In saying those words, he burst into a fit of sobbing and crying:\nweakly at first, then passionately.",
        "’\"Murderer!  I climbed the tree on the night when you brought her\nback.  I heard her, from the tree, speak of the Death-watch at the\ndoor.  I was three times in the tree while you were shut up with\nher, slowly killing her.  I saw her, from the tree, lie dead upon\nher bed.  I have watched you, from the tree, for proofs and traces\nof your guilt.  The manner of it, is a mystery to me yet, but I\nwill pursue you until you have rendered up your life to the\nhangman.  You shall never, until then, be rid of me.  I loved her!\nI can know no relenting towards you.  Murderer, I loved her!”",
        "’The youth was bare-headed, his hat having fluttered away in his\ndescent from the tree.  He moved towards the gate.  He had to pass\n- Him - to get to it.  There was breadth for two old-fashioned\ncarriages abreast; and the youth’s abhorrence, openly expressed in\nevery feature of his face and limb of his body, and very hard to\nbear, had verge enough to keep itself at a distance in.  He (by\nwhich I mean the other) had not stirred hand or foot, since he had\nstood still to look at the boy.  He faced round, now, to follow him\nwith his eyes.  As the back of the bare light-brown head was turned\nto him, he saw a red curve stretch from his hand to it.  He knew,\nbefore he threw the bill-hook, where it had alighted - I say, had\nalighted, and not, would alight; for, to his clear perception the\nthing was done before he did it.  It cleft the head, and it\nremained there, and the boy lay on his face.",
        "’He buried the body in the night, at the foot of the tree.  As soon\nas it was light in the morning, he worked at turning up all the\nground near the tree, and hacking and hewing at the neighbouring\nbushes and undergrowth.  When the labourers came, there was nothing\nsuspicious, and nothing suspected.",
        "’But, he had, in a moment, defeated all his precautions, and\ndestroyed the triumph of the scheme he had so long concerted, and\nso successfully worked out.  He had got rid of the Bride, and had\nacquired her fortune without endangering his life; but now, for a\ndeath by which he had gained nothing, he had evermore to live with\na rope around his neck.",
        "’Beyond this, he was chained to the house of gloom and horror,\nwhich he could not endure.  Being afraid to sell it or to quit it,\nlest discovery should be made, he was forced to live in it.  He\nhired two old people, man and wife, for his servants; and dwelt in\nit, and dreaded it.  His great difficulty, for a long time, was the\ngarden.  Whether he should keep it trim, whether he should suffer\nit to fall into its former state of neglect, what would be the\nleast likely way of attracting attention to it?",
        "’He took the middle course of gardening, himself, in his evening\nleisure, and of then calling the old serving-man to help him; but,\nof never letting him work there alone.  And he made himself an\narbour over against the tree, where he could sit and see that it\nwas safe.",
        "’As the seasons changed, and the tree changed, his mind perceived\ndangers that were always changing.  In the leafy time, he perceived\nthat the upper boughs were growing into the form of the young man -\nthat they made the shape of him exactly, sitting in a forked branch\nswinging in the wind.  In the time of the falling leaves, he\nperceived that they came down from the tree, forming tell-tale\nletters on the path, or that they had a tendency to heap themselves\ninto a churchyard mound above the grave.  In the winter, when the\ntree was bare, he perceived that the boughs swung at him the ghost\nof the blow the young man had given, and that they threatened him\nopenly.  In the spring, when the sap was mounting in the trunk, he\nasked himself, were the dried-up particles of blood mounting with\nit:  to make out more obviously this year than last, the leaf-\nscreened figure of the young man, swinging in the wind?",
        "’However, he turned his Money over and over, and still over.  He\nwas in the dark trade, the gold-dust trade, and most secret trades\nthat yielded great returns.  In ten years, he had turned his Money\nover, so many times, that the traders and shippers who had dealings\nwith him, absolutely did not lie - for once - when they declared\nthat he had increased his fortune, Twelve Hundred Per Cent.",
        "’He possessed his riches one hundred years ago, when people could\nbe lost easily.  He had heard who the youth was, from hearing of\nthe search that was made after him; but, it died away, and the\nyouth was forgotten.",
        "’The annual round of changes in the tree had been repeated ten\ntimes since the night of the burial at its foot, when there was a\ngreat thunder-storm over this place.  It broke at midnight, and\nroared until morning.  The first intelligence he heard from his old\nserving-man that morning, was, that the tree had been struck by\nLightning.",
        "’It had been riven down the stem, in a very surprising manner, and\nthe stem lay in two blighted shafts:  one resting against the\nhouse, and one against a portion of the old red garden-wall in\nwhich its fall had made a gap.  The fissure went down the tree to a\nlittle above the earth, and there stopped.  There was great\ncuriosity to see the tree, and, with most of his former fears\nrevived, he sat in his arbour - grown quite an old man - watching\nthe people who came to see it.",
        "’They quickly began to come, in such dangerous numbers, that he\nclosed his garden-gate and refused to admit any more.  But, there\nwere certain men of science who travelled from a distance to\nexamine the tree, and, in an evil hour, he let them in! - Blight\nand Murrain on them, let them in!",
        "’They wanted to dig up the ruin by the roots, and closely examine\nit, and the earth about it.  Never, while he lived!  They offered\nmoney for it.  They!  Men of science, whom he could have bought by\nthe gross, with a scratch of his pen!  He showed them the garden-\ngate again, and locked and barred it.",
        "’But they were bent on doing what they wanted to do, and they\nbribed the old serving-man - a thankless wretch who regularly\ncomplained when he received his wages, of being underpaid - and\nthey stole into the garden by night with their lanterns, picks, and\nshovels, and fell to at the tree.  He was lying in a turret-room on\nthe other side of the house (the Bride’s Chamber had been\nunoccupied ever since), but he soon dreamed of picks and shovels,\nand got up.",
        "’He came to an upper window on that side, whence he could see their\nlanterns, and them, and the loose earth in a heap which he had\nhimself disturbed and put back, when it was last turned to the air.\nIt was found!  They had that minute lighted on it.  They were all\nbending over it.  One of them said, “The skull is fractured;” and\nanother, “See here the bones;” and another, “See here the clothes;\"\nand then the first struck in again, and said, “A rusty bill-hook!”",
        "’He became sensible, next day, that he was already put under a\nstrict watch, and that he could go nowhere without being followed.\nBefore a week was out, he was taken and laid in hold.  The\ncircumstances were gradually pieced together against him, with a\ndesperate malignity, and an appalling ingenuity.  But, see the\njustice of men, and how it was extended to him!  He was further\naccused of having poisoned that girl in the Bride’s Chamber.  He,\nwho had carefully and expressly avoided imperilling a hair of his\nhead for her, and who had seen her die of her own incapacity!",
        "’There was doubt for which of the two murders he should be first\ntried; but, the real one was chosen, and he was found Guilty, and\ncast for death.  Bloodthirsty wretches!  They would have made him\nGuilty of anything, so set they were upon having his life.",
        "’His money could do nothing to save him, and he was hanged.  I am\nHe, and I was hanged at Lancaster Castle with my face to the wall,\na hundred years ago!’",
        "\nAt this terrific announcement, Mr. Goodchild tried to rise and cry\nout.  But, the two fiery lines extending from the old man’s eyes to\nhis own, kept him down, and he could not utter a sound.  His sense\nof hearing, however, was acute, and he could hear the clock strike\nTwo.  No sooner had he heard the clock strike Two, than he saw\nbefore him Two old men!",
        "TWO.",
        "The eyes of each, connected with his eyes by two films of fire:\neach, exactly like the other:  each, addressing him at precisely\none and the same instant:  each, gnashing the same teeth in the\nsame head, with the same twitched nostril above them, and the same\nsuffused expression around it.  Two old men.  Differing in nothing,\nequally distinct to the sight, the copy no fainter than the\noriginal, the second as real as the first.",
        "’At what time,’ said the Two old men, ’did you arrive at the door\nbelow?’",
        "’At Six.’",
        "’And there were Six old men upon the stairs!’",
        "Mr. Goodchild having wiped the perspiration from his brow, or tried\nto do it, the Two old men proceeded in one voice, and in the\nsingular number:",
        "’I had been anatomised, but had not yet had my skeleton put\ntogether and re-hung on an iron hook, when it began to be whispered\nthat the Bride’s Chamber was haunted.  It WAS haunted, and I was\nthere.",
        "’WE were there.  She and I were there.  I, in the chair upon the\nhearth; she, a white wreck again, trailing itself towards me on the\nfloor.  But, I was the speaker no more, and the one word that she\nsaid to me from midnight until dawn was, ’Live!’",
        "’The youth was there, likewise.  In the tree outside the window.\nComing and going in the moonlight, as the tree bent and gave.  He\nhas, ever since, been there, peeping in at me in my torment;\nrevealing to me by snatches, in the pale lights and slatey shadows\nwhere he comes and goes, bare-headed - a bill-hook, standing\nedgewise in his hair.",
        "’In the Bride’s Chamber, every night from midnight until dawn - one\nmonth in the year excepted, as I am going to tell you - he hides in\nthe tree, and she comes towards me on the floor; always\napproaching; never coming nearer; always visible as if by moon-\nlight, whether the moon shines or no; always saying, from mid-night\nuntil dawn, her one word, “Live!”",
        "’But, in the month wherein I was forced out of this life - this\npresent month of thirty days - the Bride’s Chamber is empty and\nquiet.  Not so my old dungeon.  Not so the rooms where I was\nrestless and afraid, ten years.  Both are fitfully haunted then.\nAt One in the morning.  I am what you saw me when the clock struck\nthat hour - One old man.  At Two in the morning, I am Two old men.\nAt Three, I am Three.  By Twelve at noon, I am Twelve old men, One\nfor every hundred per cent. of old gain.  Every one of the Twelve,\nwith Twelve times my old power of suffering and agony.  From that\nhour until Twelve at night, I, Twelve old men in anguish and\nfearful foreboding, wait for the coming of the executioner.  At\nTwelve at night, I, Twelve old men turned off, swing invisible\noutside Lancaster Castle, with Twelve faces to the wall!",
        "’When the Bride’s Chamber was first haunted, it was known to me\nthat this punishment would never cease, until I could make its\nnature, and my story, known to two living men together.  I waited\nfor the coming of two living men together into the Bride’s Chamber,\nyears upon years.  It was infused into my knowledge (of the means I\nam ignorant) that if two living men, with their eyes open, could be\nin the Bride’s Chamber at One in the morning, they would see me\nsitting in my chair.",
        "’At length, the whispers that the room was spiritually troubled,\nbrought two men to try the adventure.  I was scarcely struck upon\nthe hearth at midnight (I come there as if the Lightning blasted me\ninto being), when I heard them ascending the stairs.  Next, I saw\nthem enter.  One of them was a bold, gay, active man, in the prime\nof life, some five and forty years of age; the other, a dozen years\nyounger.  They brought provisions with them in a basket, and\nbottles.  A young woman accompanied them, with wood and coals for\nthe lighting of the fire.  When she had lighted it, the bold, gay,\nactive man accompanied her along the gallery outside the room, to\nsee her safely down the staircase, and came back laughing.",
        "’He locked the door, examined the chamber, put out the contents of\nthe basket on the table before the fire - little recking of me, in\nmy appointed station on the hearth, close to him - and filled the\nglasses, and ate and drank.  His companion did the same, and was as\ncheerful and confident as he:  though he was the leader.  When they\nhad supped, they laid pistols on the table, turned to the fire, and\nbegan to smoke their pipes of foreign make.",
        "’They had travelled together, and had been much together, and had\nan abundance of subjects in common.  In the midst of their talking\nand laughing, the younger man made a reference to the leader’s\nbeing always ready for any adventure; that one, or any other.  He\nreplied in these words:",
        "’\"Not quite so, Dick; if I am afraid of nothing else, I am afraid\nof myself.”",
        "’His companion seeming to grow a little dull, asked him, in what\nsense?  How?",
        "’\"Why, thus,” he returned.  “Here is a Ghost to be disproved.\nWell!  I cannot answer for what my fancy might do if I were alone\nhere, or what tricks my senses might play with me if they had me to\nthemselves.  But, in company with another man, and especially with\nDick, I would consent to outface all the Ghosts that were ever of\nin the universe.”",
        "’\"I had not the vanity to suppose that I was of so much importance\nto-night,” said the other.",
        "’\"Of so much,” rejoined the leader, more seriously than he had\nspoken yet, “that I would, for the reason I have given, on no\naccount have undertaken to pass the night here alone.”",
        "’It was within a few minutes of One.  The head of the younger man\nhad drooped when he made his last remark, and it drooped lower now.",
        "’\"Keep awake, Dick!” said the leader, gaily.  “The small hours are\nthe worst.”",
        "’He tried, but his head drooped again.",
        "’\"Dick!” urged the leader.  “Keep awake!”",
        "’\"I can’t,” he indistinctly muttered.  “I don’t know what strange\ninfluence is stealing over me.  I can’t.”",
        "’His companion looked at him with a sudden horror, and I, in my\ndifferent way, felt a new horror also; for, it was on the stroke of\nOne, and I felt that the second watcher was yielding to me, and\nthat the curse was upon me that I must send him to sleep.",
        "’\"Get up and walk, Dick!” cried the leader.  “Try!”",
        "’It was in vain to go behind the slumber’s chair and shake him.\nOne o’clock sounded, and I was present to the elder man, and he\nstood transfixed before me.",
        "’To him alone, I was obliged to relate my story, without hope of\nbenefit.  To him alone, I was an awful phantom making a quite\nuseless confession.  I foresee it will ever be the same.  The two\nliving men together will never come to release me.  When I appear,\nthe senses of one of the two will be locked in sleep; he will\nneither see nor hear me; my communication will ever be made to a\nsolitary listener, and will ever be unserviceable.  Woe!  Woe!\nWoe!’",
        "As the Two old men, with these words, wrung their hands, it shot\ninto Mr. Goodchild’s mind that he was in the terrible situation of\nbeing virtually alone with the spectre, and that Mr. Idle’s\nimmoveability was explained by his having been charmed asleep at\nOne o’clock.  In the terror of this sudden discovery which produced\nan indescribable dread, he struggled so hard to get free from the\nfour fiery threads, that he snapped them, after he had pulled them\nout to a great width.  Being then out of bonds, he caught up Mr.\nIdle from the sofa and rushed down-stairs with him.",
        "\n’What are you about, Francis?’ demanded Mr. Idle.  ’My bedroom is\nnot down here.  What the deuce are you carrying me at all for?  I\ncan walk with a stick now.  I don’t want to be carried.  Put me\ndown.’",
        "Mr. Goodchild put him down in the old hall, and looked about him\nwildly.",
        "’What are you doing?  Idiotically plunging at your own sex, and\nrescuing them or perishing in the attempt?’ asked Mr. Idle, in a\nhighly petulant state.",
        "’The One old man!’ cried Mr. Goodchild, distractedly, - ’and the\nTwo old men!’",
        "Mr. Idle deigned no other reply than ’The One old woman, I think\nyou mean,’ as he began hobbling his way back up the staircase, with\nthe assistance of its broad balustrade.",
        "’I assure you, Tom,’ began Mr. Goodchild, attending at his side,\n’that since you fell asleep - ’",
        "’Come, I like that!’ said Thomas Idle, ’I haven’t closed an eye!’",
        "With the peculiar sensitiveness on the subject of the disgraceful\naction of going to sleep out of bed, which is the lot of all\nmankind, Mr. Idle persisted in this declaration.  The same peculiar\nsensitiveness impelled Mr. Goodchild, on being taxed with the same\ncrime, to repudiate it with honourable resentment.  The settlement\nof the question of The One old man and The Two old men was thus\npresently complicated, and soon made quite impracticable.  Mr. Idle\nsaid it was all Bride-cake, and fragments, newly arranged, of\nthings seen and thought about in the day.  Mr. Goodchild said how\ncould that be, when he hadn’t been asleep, and what right could Mr.\nIdle have to say so, who had been asleep?  Mr. Idle said he had\nnever been asleep, and never did go to sleep, and that Mr.\nGoodchild, as a general rule, was always asleep.  They consequently\nparted for the rest of the night, at their bedroom doors, a little\nruffled.  Mr. Goodchild’s last words were, that he had had, in that\nreal and tangible old sitting-room of that real and tangible old\nInn (he supposed Mr. Idle denied its existence?), every sensation\nand experience, the present record of which is now within a line or\ntwo of completion; and that he would write it out and print it\nevery word.  Mr. Idle returned that he might if he liked - and he\ndid like, and has now done it.",
        "Two of the many passengers by a certain late Sunday evening train,\nMr. Thomas Idle and Mr. Francis Goodchild, yielded up their tickets\nat a little rotten platform (converted into artificial touchwood by\nsmoke and ashes), deep in the manufacturing bosom of Yorkshire.  A\nmysterious bosom it appeared, upon a damp, dark, Sunday night,\ndashed through in the train to the music of the whirling wheels,\nthe panting of the engine, and the part-singing of hundreds of\nthird-class excursionists, whose vocal efforts ’bobbed arayound’\nfrom sacred to profane, from hymns, to our transatlantic sisters\nthe Yankee Gal and Mairy Anne, in a remarkable way.  There seemed\nto have been some large vocal gathering near to every lonely\nstation on the line.  No town was visible, no village was visible,\nno light was visible; but, a multitude got out singing, and a\nmultitude got in singing, and the second multitude took up the\nhymns, and adopted our transatlantic sisters, and sang of their own\negregious wickedness, and of their bobbing arayound, and of how the\nship it was ready and the wind it was fair, and they were bayound\nfor the sea, Mairy Anne, until they in their turn became a getting-\nout multitude, and were replaced by another getting-in multitude,\nwho did the same.  And at every station, the getting-in multitude,\nwith an artistic reference to the completeness of their chorus,\nincessantly cried, as with one voice while scuffling into the\ncarriages, ’We mun aa’ gang toogither!’",
        "The singing and the multitudes had trailed off as the lonely places\nwere left and the great towns were neared, and the way had lain as\nsilently as a train’s way ever can, over the vague black streets of\nthe great gulfs of towns, and among their branchless woods of vague\nblack chimneys.  These towns looked, in the cinderous wet, as\nthough they had one and all been on fire and were just put out - a\ndreary and quenched panorama, many miles long.",
        "Thus, Thomas and Francis got to Leeds; of which enterprising and\nimportant commercial centre it may be observed with delicacy, that\nyou must either like it very much or not at all.  Next day, the\nfirst of the Race-Week, they took train to Doncaster.",
        "And instantly the character, both of travellers and of luggage,\nentirely changed, and no other business than race-business any\nlonger existed on the face of the earth.  The talk was all of\nhorses and ’John Scott.’  Guards whispered behind their hands to\nstation-masters, of horses and John Scott.  Men in cut-away coats\nand speckled cravats fastened with peculiar pins, and with the\nlarge bones of their legs developed under tight trousers, so that\nthey should look as much as possible like horses’ legs, paced up\nand down by twos at junction-stations, speaking low and moodily of\nhorses and John Scott.  The young clergyman in the black strait-\nwaistcoat, who occupied the middle seat of the carriage, expounded\nin his peculiar pulpit-accent to the young and lovely Reverend Mrs.\nCrinoline, who occupied the opposite middle-seat, a few passages of\nrumour relative to ’Oartheth, my love, and Mithter John Eth-COTT.’\nA bandy vagabond, with a head like a Dutch cheese, in a fustian\nstable-suit, attending on a horse-box and going about the platforms\nwith a halter hanging round his neck like a Calais burgher of the\nancient period much degenerated, was courted by the best society,\nby reason of what he had to hint, when not engaged in eating straw,\nconcerning ’t’harses and Joon Scott.’  The engine-driver himself,\nas he applied one eye to his large stationary double-eye-glass on\nthe engine, seemed to keep the other open, sideways, upon horses\nand John Scott.",
        "Breaks and barriers at Doncaster Station to keep the crowd off;\ntemporary wooden avenues of ingress and egress, to help the crowd\non.  Forty extra porters sent down for this present blessed Race-\nWeek, and all of them making up their betting-books in the lamp-\nroom or somewhere else, and none of them to come and touch the\nluggage.  Travellers disgorged into an open space, a howling\nwilderness of idle men.  All work but race-work at a stand-still;\nall men at a stand-still.  ’Ey my word!  Deant ask noon o’ us to\nhelp wi’ t’luggage.  Bock your opinion loike a mon.  Coom!  Dang\nit, coom, t’harses and Joon Scott!’  In the midst of the idle men,\nall the fly horses and omnibus horses of Doncaster and parts\nadjacent, rampant, rearing, backing, plunging, shying - apparently\nthe result of their hearing of nothing but their own order and John\nScott.",
        "Grand Dramatic Company from London for the Race-Week.  Poses\nPlastiques in the Grand Assembly Room up the Stable-Yard at seven\nand nine each evening, for the Race-Week.  Grand Alliance Circus in\nthe field beyond the bridge, for the Race-Week.  Grand Exhibition\nof Aztec Lilliputians, important to all who want to be horrified\ncheap, for the Race-Week.  Lodgings, grand and not grand, but all\nat grand prices, ranging from ten pounds to twenty, for the Grand\nRace-Week!",
        "Rendered giddy enough by these things, Messieurs Idle and Goodchild\nrepaired to the quarters they had secured beforehand, and Mr.\nGoodchild looked down from the window into the surging street.",
        "’By Heaven, Tom!’ cried he, after contemplating it, ’I am in the\nLunatic Asylum again, and these are all mad people under the charge\nof a body of designing keepers!’",
        "All through the Race-Week, Mr. Goodchild never divested himself of\nthis idea.  Every day he looked out of window, with something of\nthe dread of Lemuel Gulliver looking down at men after he returned\nhome from the horse-country; and every day he saw the Lunatics,\nhorse-mad, betting-mad, drunken-mad, vice-mad, and the designing\nKeepers always after them.  The idea pervaded, like the second\ncolour in shot-silk, the whole of Mr. Goodchild’s impressions.\nThey were much as follows:",
        "Monday, mid-day.  Races not to begin until to-morrow, but all the\nmob-Lunatics out, crowding the pavements of the one main street of\npretty and pleasant Doncaster, crowding the road, particularly\ncrowding the outside of the Betting Rooms, whooping and shouting\nloudly after all passing vehicles.  Frightened lunatic horses\noccasionally running away, with infinite clatter.  All degrees of\nmen, from peers to paupers, betting incessantly.  Keepers very\nwatchful, and taking all good chances.  An awful family likeness\namong the Keepers, to Mr. Palmer and Mr. Thurtell.  With some\nknowledge of expression and some acquaintance with heads (thus\nwrites Mr. Goodchild), I never have seen anywhere, so many\nrepetitions of one class of countenance and one character of head\n(both evil) as in this street at this time.  Cunning, covetousness,\nsecrecy, cold calculation, hard callousness and dire insensibility,\nare the uniform Keeper characteristics.  Mr. Palmer passes me five\ntimes in five minutes, and, so I go down the street, the back of\nMr. Thurtell’s skull is always going on before me.",
        "Monday evening.  Town lighted up; more Lunatics out than ever; a\ncomplete choke and stoppage of the thoroughfare outside the Betting\nRooms.  Keepers, having dined, pervade the Betting Rooms, and\nsharply snap at the moneyed Lunatics.  Some Keepers flushed with\ndrink, and some not, but all close and calculating.  A vague\nechoing roar of ’t’harses’ and ’t’races’ always rising in the air,\nuntil midnight, at about which period it dies away in occasional\ndrunken songs and straggling yells.  But, all night, some\nunmannerly drinking-house in the neighbourhood opens its mouth at\nintervals and spits out a man too drunk to be retained:  who\nthereupon makes what uproarious protest may be left in him, and\neither falls asleep where he tumbles, or is carried off in custody.",
        "Tuesday morning, at daybreak.  A sudden rising, as it were out of\nthe earth, of all the obscene creatures, who sell ’correct cards of\nthe races.’  They may have been coiled in corners, or sleeping on\ndoor-steps, and, having all passed the night under the same set of\ncircumstances, may all want to circulate their blood at the same\ntime; but, however that may be, they spring into existence all at\nonce and together, as though a new Cadmus had sown a race-horse’s\nteeth.  There is nobody up, to buy the cards; but, the cards are\nmadly cried.  There is no patronage to quarrel for; but, they madly\nquarrel and fight.  Conspicuous among these hyaenas, as breakfast-\ntime discloses, is a fearful creature in the general semblance of a\nman:  shaken off his next-to-no legs by drink and devilry, bare-\nheaded and bare-footed, with a great shock of hair like a horrible\nbroom, and nothing on him but a ragged pair of trousers and a pink\nglazed-calico coat - made on him - so very tight that it is as\nevident that he could never take it off, as that he never does.\nThis hideous apparition, inconceivably drunk, has a terrible power\nof making a gong-like imitation of the braying of an ass:  which\nfeat requires that he should lay his right jaw in his begrimed\nright paw, double himself up, and shake his bray out of himself,\nwith much staggering on his next-to-no legs, and much twirling of\nhis horrible broom, as if it were a mop.  From the present minute,\nwhen he comes in sight holding up his cards to the windows, and\nhoarsely proposing purchase to My Lord, Your Excellency, Colonel,\nthe Noble Captain, and Your Honourable Worship - from the present\nminute until the Grand Race-Week is finished, at all hours of the\nmorning, evening, day, and night, shall the town reverberate, at\ncapricious intervals, to the brays of this frightful animal the\nGong-donkey.",
        "No very great racing to-day, so no very great amount of vehicles:\nthough there is a good sprinkling, too:  from farmers’ carts and\ngigs, to carriages with post-horses and to fours-in-hand, mostly\ncoming by the road from York, and passing on straight through the\nmain street to the Course.  A walk in the wrong direction may be a\nbetter thing for Mr. Goodchild to-day than the Course, so he walks\nin the wrong direction.  Everybody gone to the races.  Only\nchildren in the street.  Grand Alliance Circus deserted; not one\nStar-Rider left; omnibus which forms the Pay-Place, having on\nseparate panels Pay here for the Boxes, Pay here for the Pit, Pay\nhere for the Gallery, hove down in a corner and locked up; nobody\nnear the tent but the man on his knees on the grass, who is making\nthe paper balloons for the Star young gentlemen to jump through to-\nnight.  A pleasant road, pleasantly wooded.  No labourers working\nin the fields; all gone ’t’races.’  The few late wenders of their\nway ’t’races,’ who are yet left driving on the road, stare in\namazement at the recluse who is not going ’t’races.’  Roadside\ninnkeeper has gone ’t’races.’  Turnpike-man has gone ’t’races.’\nHis thrifty wife, washing clothes at the toll-house door, is going\n’t’races’ to-morrow.  Perhaps there may be no one left to take the\ntoll to-morrow; who knows?  Though assuredly that would be neither\nturnpike-like nor Yorkshire-like.  The very wind and dust seem to\nbe hurrying ’t’races,’ as they briskly pass the only wayfarer on\nthe road.  In the distance, the Railway Engine, waiting at the\ntown-end, shrieks despairingly.  Nothing but the difficulty of\ngetting off the Line, restrains that Engine from going ’t’races,’\ntoo, it is very clear.",
        "At night, more Lunatics out than last night - and more Keepers.\nThe latter very active at the Betting Rooms, the street in front of\nwhich is now impassable.  Mr. Palmer as before.  Mr. Thurtell as\nbefore.  Roar and uproar as before.  Gradual subsidence as before.\nUnmannerly drinking-house expectorates as before.  Drunken negro-\nmelodists, Gong-donkey, and correct cards, in the night.",
        "On Wednesday morning, the morning of the great St. Leger, it\nbecomes apparent that there has been a great influx since\nyesterday, both of Lunatics and Keepers.  The families of the\ntradesmen over the way are no longer within human ken; their places\nknow them no more; ten, fifteen, and twenty guinea-lodgers fill\nthem.  At the pastry-cook’s second-floor window, a Keeper is\nbrushing Mr. Thurtell’s hair - thinking it his own.  In the wax-\nchandler’s attic, another Keeper is putting on Mr. Palmer’s braces.\nIn the gunsmith’s nursery, a Lunatic is shaving himself.  In the\nserious stationer’s best sitting-room, three Lunatics are taking a\ncombination-breakfast, praising the (cook’s) devil, and drinking\nneat brandy in an atmosphere of last midnight’s cigars.  No family\nsanctuary is free from our Angelic messengers - we put up at the\nAngel - who in the guise of extra waiters for the grand Race-Week,\nrattle in and out of the most secret chambers of everybody’s house,\nwith dishes and tin covers, decanters, soda-water bottles, and\nglasses.  An hour later.  Down the street and up the street, as far\nas eyes can see and a good deal farther, there is a dense crowd;\noutside the Betting Rooms it is like a great struggle at a theatre\ndoor - in the days of theatres; or at the vestibule of the Spurgeon\ntemple - in the days of Spurgeon.  An hour later.  Fusing into this\ncrowd, and somehow getting through it, are all kinds of\nconveyances, and all kinds of foot-passengers; carts, with brick-\nmakers and brick-makeresses jolting up and down on planks; drags,\nwith the needful grooms behind, sitting cross-armed in the needful\nmanner, and slanting themselves backward from the soles of their\nboots at the needful angle; postboys, in the shining hats and smart\njackets of the olden time, when stokers were not; beautiful\nYorkshire horses, gallantly driven by their own breeders and\nmasters.  Under every pole, and every shaft, and every horse, and\nevery wheel as it would seem, the Gong-donkey - metallically\nbraying, when not struggling for life, or whipped out of the way.",
        "By one o’clock, all this stir has gone out of the streets, and\nthere is no one left in them but Francis Goodchild.  Francis\nGoodchild will not be left in them long; for, he too is on his way,\n’t’races.’",
        "A most beautiful sight, Francis Goodchild finds ’t’races’ to be,\nwhen he has left fair Doncaster behind him, and comes out on the\nfree course, with its agreeable prospect, its quaint Red House\noddly changing and turning as Francis turns, its green grass, and\nfresh heath.  A free course and an easy one, where Francis can roll\nsmoothly where he will, and can choose between the start, or the\ncoming-in, or the turn behind the brow of the hill, or any out-of-\nthe-way point where he lists to see the throbbing horses straining\nevery nerve, and making the sympathetic earth throb as they come\nby.  Francis much delights to be, not in the Grand Stand, but where\nhe can see it, rising against the sky with its vast tiers of little\nwhite dots of faces, and its last high rows and corners of people,\nlooking like pins stuck into an enormous pincushion - not quite so\nsymmetrically as his orderly eye could wish, when people change or\ngo away.  When the race is nearly run out, it is as good as the\nrace to him to see the flutter among the pins, and the change in\nthem from dark to light, as hats are taken off and waved.  Not less\nfull of interest, the loud anticipation of the winner’s name, the\nswelling, and the final, roar; then, the quick dropping of all the\npins out of their places, the revelation of the shape of the bare\npincushion, and the closing-in of the whole host of Lunatics and\nKeepers, in the rear of the three horses with bright-coloured\nriders, who have not yet quite subdued their gallop though the\ncontest is over.",
        "Mr. Goodchild would appear to have been by no means free from\nlunacy himself at ’t’races,’ though not of the prevalent kind.  He\nis suspected by Mr. Idle to have fallen into a dreadful state\nconcerning a pair of little lilac gloves and a little bonnet that\nhe saw there.  Mr. Idle asserts, that he did afterwards repeat at\nthe Angel, with an appearance of being lunatically seized, some\nrhapsody to the following effect:  ’O little lilac gloves!  And O\nwinning little bonnet, making in conjunction with her golden hair\nquite a Glory in the sunlight round the pretty head, why anything\nin the world but you and me!  Why may not this day’s running-of\nhorses, to all the rest:  of precious sands of life to me - be\nprolonged through an everlasting autumn-sunshine, without a sunset!\nSlave of the Lamp, or Ring, strike me yonder gallant equestrian\nClerk of the Course, in the scarlet coat, motionless on the green\ngrass for ages!  Friendly Devil on Two Sticks, for ten times ten\nthousands years, keep Blink-Bonny jibbing at the post, and let us\nhave no start!  Arab drums, powerful of old to summon Genii in the\ndesert, sound of yourselves and raise a troop for me in the desert\nof my heart, which shall so enchant this dusty barouche (with a\nconspicuous excise-plate, resembling the Collector’s door-plate at\na turnpike), that I, within it, loving the little lilac gloves, the\nwinning little bonnet, and the dear unknown-wearer with the golden\nhair, may wait by her side for ever, to see a Great St. Leger that\nshall never be run!’",
        "Thursday morning.  After a tremendous night of crowding, shouting,\ndrinking-house expectoration, Gong-donkey, and correct cards.\nSymptoms of yesterday’s gains in the way of drink, and of\nyesterday’s losses in the way of money, abundant.  Money-losses\nvery great.  As usual, nobody seems to have won; but, large losses\nand many losers are unquestionable facts.  Both Lunatics and\nKeepers, in general very low.  Several of both kinds look in at the\nchemist’s while Mr. Goodchild is making a purchase there, to be\n’picked up.’  One red-eyed Lunatic, flushed, faded, and disordered,\nenters hurriedly and cries savagely, ’Hond us a gloss of sal\nvolatile in wather, or soom dommed thing o’ thot sart!’  Faces at\nthe Betting Rooms very long, and a tendency to bite nails\nobservable.  Keepers likewise given this morning to standing about\nsolitary, with their hands in their pockets, looking down at their\nboots as they fit them into cracks of the pavement, and then\nlooking up whistling and walking away.  Grand Alliance Circus out,\nin procession; buxom lady-member of Grand Alliance, in crimson\nriding-habit, fresher to look at, even in her paint under the day\nsky, than the cheeks of Lunatics or Keepers.  Spanish Cavalier\nappears to have lost yesterday, and jingles his bossed bridle with\ndisgust, as if he were paying.  Reaction also apparent at the\nGuildhall opposite, whence certain pickpockets come out handcuffed\ntogether, with that peculiar walk which is never seen under any\nother circumstances - a walk expressive of going to jail, game, but\nstill of jails being in bad taste and arbitrary, and how would YOU\nlike it if it was you instead of me, as it ought to be!  Mid-day.\nTown filled as yesterday, but not so full; and emptied as\nyesterday, but not so empty.  In the evening, Angel ordinary where\nevery Lunatic and Keeper has his modest daily meal of turtle,\nvenison, and wine, not so crowded as yesterday, and not so noisy.\nAt night, the theatre.  More abstracted faces in it than one ever\nsees at public assemblies; such faces wearing an expression which\nstrongly reminds Mr. Goodchild of the boys at school who were\n’going up next,’ with their arithmetic or mathematics.  These boys\nare, no doubt, going up to-morrow with THEIR sums and figures.  Mr.\nPalmer and Mr. Thurtell in the boxes O. P.  Mr. Thurtell and Mr.\nPalmer in the boxes P. S.  The firm of Thurtell, Palmer, and\nThurtell, in the boxes Centre.  A most odious tendency observable\nin these distinguished gentlemen to put vile constructions on\nsufficiently innocent phrases in the play, and then to applaud them\nin a Satyr-like manner.  Behind Mr. Goodchild, with a party of\nother Lunatics and one Keeper, the express incarnation of the thing\ncalled a ’gent.’  A gentleman born; a gent manufactured.  A\nsomething with a scarf round its neck, and a slipshod speech\nissuing from behind the scarf; more depraved, more foolish, more\nignorant, more unable to believe in any noble or good thing of any\nkind, than the stupidest Bosjesman.  The thing is but a boy in\nyears, and is addled with drink.  To do its company justice, even\nits company is ashamed of it, as it drawls its slang criticisms on\nthe representation, and inflames Mr. Goodchild with a burning\nardour to fling it into the pit.  Its remarks are so horrible, that\nMr. Goodchild, for the moment, even doubts whether that IS a\nwholesome Art, which sets women apart on a high floor before such a\nthing as this, though as good as its own sisters, or its own mother\n- whom Heaven forgive for bringing it into the world!  But, the\nconsideration that a low nature must make a low world of its own to\nlive in, whatever the real materials, or it could no more exist\nthan any of us could without the sense of touch, brings Mr.\nGoodchild to reason:  the rather, because the thing soon drops its\ndowny chin upon its scarf, and slobbers itself asleep.",
        "Friday Morning.  Early fights.  Gong-donkey, and correct cards.\nAgain, a great set towards the races, though not so great a set as\non Wednesday.  Much packing going on too, upstairs at the gun-\nsmith’s, the wax-chandler’s, and the serious stationer’s; for there\nwill be a heavy drift of Lunatics and Keepers to London by the\nafternoon train.  The course as pretty as ever; the great\npincushion as like a pincushion, but not nearly so full of pins;\nwhole rows of pins wanting.  On the great event of the day, both\nLunatics and Keepers become inspired with rage; and there is a\nviolent scuffling, and a rushing at the losing jockey, and an\nemergence of the said jockey from a swaying and menacing crowd,\nprotected by friends, and looking the worse for wear; which is a\nrough proceeding, though animating to see from a pleasant distance.\nAfter the great event, rills begin to flow from the pincushion\ntowards the railroad; the rills swell into rivers; the rivers soon\nunite into a lake.  The lake floats Mr. Goodchild into Doncaster,\npast the Itinerant personage in black, by the way-side telling him\nfrom the vantage ground of a legibly printed placard on a pole that\nfor all these things the Lord will bring him to judgment.  No\nturtle and venison ordinary this evening; that is all over.  No\nBetting at the rooms; nothing there but the plants in pots, which\nhave, all the week, been stood about the entry to give it an\ninnocent appearance, and which have sorely sickened by this time.",
        "Saturday.  Mr. Idle wishes to know at breakfast, what were those\ndreadful groanings in his bedroom doorway in the night?  Mr.\nGoodchild answers, Nightmare.  Mr. Idle repels the calumny, and\ncalls the waiter.  The Angel is very sorry - had intended to\nexplain; but you see, gentlemen, there was a gentleman dined down-\nstairs with two more, and he had lost a deal of money, and he would\ndrink a deal of wine, and in the night he ’took the horrors,’ and\ngot up; and as his friends could do nothing with him he laid\nhimself down and groaned at Mr. Idle’s door.  ’And he DID groan\nthere,’ Mr. Idle says; ’and you will please to imagine me inside,\n\"taking the horrors” too!’",
        "\nSo far, the picture of Doncaster on the occasion of its great\nsporting anniversary, offers probably a general representation of\nthe social condition of the town, in the past as well as in the\npresent time.  The sole local phenomenon of the current year, which\nmay be considered as entirely unprecedented in its way, and which\ncertainly claims, on that account, some slight share of notice,\nconsists in the actual existence of one remarkable individual, who\nis sojourning in Doncaster, and who, neither directly nor\nindirectly, has anything at all to do, in any capacity whatever,\nwith the racing amusements of the week.  Ranging throughout the\nentire crowd that fills the town, and including the inhabitants as\nwell as the visitors, nobody is to be found altogether disconnected\nwith the business of the day, excepting this one unparalleled man.\nHe does not bet on the races, like the sporting men.  He does not\nassist the races, like the jockeys, starters, judges, and grooms.\nHe does not look on at the races, like Mr. Goodchild and his\nfellow-spectators.  He does not profit by the races, like the\nhotel-keepers and the tradespeople.  He does not minister to the\nnecessities of the races, like the booth-keepers, the postilions,\nthe waiters, and the hawkers of Lists.  He does not assist the\nattractions of the races, like the actors at the theatre, the\nriders at the circus, or the posturers at the Poses Plastiques.\nAbsolutely and literally, he is the only individual in Doncaster\nwho stands by the brink of the full-flowing race-stream, and is not\nswept away by it in common with all the rest of his species.  Who\nis this modern hermit, this recluse of the St. Leger-week, this\ninscrutably ungregarious being, who lives apart from the amusements\nand activities of his fellow-creatures?  Surely, there is little\ndifficulty in guessing that clearest and easiest of all riddles.\nWho could he be, but Mr. Thomas Idle?",
        "Thomas had suffered himself to be taken to Doncaster, just as he\nwould have suffered himself to be taken to any other place in the\nhabitable globe which would guarantee him the temporary possession\nof a comfortable sofa to rest his ankle on.  Once established at\nthe hotel, with his leg on one cushion and his back against\nanother, he formally declined taking the slightest interest in any\ncircumstance whatever connected with the races, or with the people\nwho were assembled to see them.  Francis Goodchild, anxious that\nthe hours should pass by his crippled travelling-companion as\nlightly as possible, suggested that his sofa should be moved to the\nwindow, and that he should amuse himself by looking out at the\nmoving panorama of humanity, which the view from it of the\nprincipal street presented.  Thomas, however, steadily declined\nprofiting by the suggestion.",
        "’The farther I am from the window,’ he said, ’the better, Brother\nFrancis, I shall be pleased.  I have nothing in common with the one\nprevalent idea of all those people who are passing in the street.\nWhy should I care to look at them?’",
        "’I hope I have nothing in common with the prevalent idea of a great\nmany of them, either,’ answered Goodchild, thinking of the sporting\ngentlemen whom he had met in the course of his wanderings about\nDoncaster.  ’But, surely, among all the people who are walking by\nthe house, at this very moment, you may find - ’",
        "’Not one living creature,’ interposed Thomas, ’who is not, in one\nway or another, interested in horses, and who is not, in a greater\nor less degree, an admirer of them.  Now, I hold opinions in\nreference to these particular members of the quadruped creation,\nwhich may lay claim (as I believe) to the disastrous distinction of\nbeing unpartaken by any other human being, civilised or savage,\nover the whole surface of the earth.  Taking the horse as an animal\nin the abstract, Francis, I cordially despise him from every point\nof view.’",
        "’Thomas,’ said Goodchild, ’confinement to the house has begun to\naffect your biliary secretions.  I shall go to the chemist’s and\nget you some physic.’",
        "’I object,’ continued Thomas, quietly possessing himself of his\nfriend’s hat, which stood on a table near him, - ’I object, first,\nto the personal appearance of the horse.  I protest against the\nconventional idea of beauty, as attached to that animal.  I think\nhis nose too long, his forehead too low, and his legs (except in\nthe case of the cart-horse) ridiculously thin by comparison with\nthe size of his body.  Again, considering how big an animal he is,\nI object to the contemptible delicacy of his constitution.  Is he\nnot the sickliest creature in creation?  Does any child catch cold\nas easily as a horse?  Does he not sprain his fetlock, for all his\nappearance of superior strength, as easily as I sprained my ankle!\nFurthermore, to take him from another point of view, what a\nhelpless wretch he is!  No fine lady requires more constant\nwaiting-on than a horse.  Other animals can make their own\ntoilette:  he must have a groom.  You will tell me that this is\nbecause we want to make his coat artificially glossy.  Glossy!\nCome home with me, and see my cat, - my clever cat, who can groom\nherself!  Look at your own dog! see how the intelligent creature\ncurry-combs himself with his own honest teeth!  Then, again, what a\nfool the horse is, what a poor, nervous fool!  He will start at a\npiece of white paper in the road as if it was a lion.  His one\nidea, when he hears a noise that he is not accustomed to, is to run\naway from it.  What do you say to those two common instances of the\nsense and courage of this absurdly overpraised animal?  I might\nmultiply them to two hundred, if I chose to exert my mind and waste\nmy breath, which I never do.  I prefer coming at once to my last\ncharge against the horse, which is the most serious of all, because\nit affects his moral character.  I accuse him boldly, in his\ncapacity of servant to man, of slyness and treachery.  I brand him\npublicly, no matter how mild he may look about the eyes, or how\nsleek he may be about the coat, as a systematic betrayer, whenever\nhe can get the chance, of the confidence reposed in him.  What do\nyou mean by laughing and shaking your head at me?’",
        "’Oh, Thomas, Thomas!’ said Goodchild.  ’You had better give me my\nhat; you had better let me get you that physic.’",
        "’I will let you get anything you like, including a composing\ndraught for yourself,’ said Thomas, irritably alluding to his\nfellow-apprentice’s inexhaustible activity, ’if you will only sit\nquiet for five minutes longer, and hear me out.  I say again the\nhorse is a betrayer of the confidence reposed in him; and that\nopinion, let me add, is drawn from my own personal experience, and\nis not based on any fanciful theory whatever.  You shall have two\ninstances, two overwhelming instances.  Let me start the first of\nthese by asking, what is the distinguishing quality which the\nShetland Pony has arrogated to himself, and is still perpetually\ntrumpeting through the world by means of popular report and books\non Natural History?  I see the answer in your face:  it is the\nquality of being Sure-Footed.  He professes to have other virtues,\nsuch as hardiness and strength, which you may discover on trial;\nbut the one thing which he insists on your believing, when you get\non his back, is that he may be safely depended on not to tumble\ndown with you.  Very good.  Some years ago, I was in Shetland with\na party of friends.  They insisted on taking me with them to the\ntop of a precipice that overhung the sea.  It was a great distance\noff, but they all determined to walk to it except me.  I was wiser\nthen than I was with you at Carrock, and I determined to be carried\nto the precipice.  There was no carriage-road in the island, and\nnobody offered (in consequence, as I suppose, of the imperfectly-\ncivilised state of the country) to bring me a sedan-chair, which is\nnaturally what I should have liked best.  A Shetland pony was\nproduced instead.  I remembered my Natural History, I recalled\npopular report, and I got on the little beast’s back, as any other\nman would have done in my position, placing implicit confidence in\nthe sureness of his feet.  And how did he repay that confidence?\nBrother Francis, carry your mind on from morning to noon.  Picture\nto yourself a howling wilderness of grass and bog, bounded by low\nstony hills.  Pick out one particular spot in that imaginary scene,\nand sketch me in it, with outstretched arms, curved back, and heels\nin the air, plunging headforemost into a black patch of water and\nmud.  Place just behind me the legs, the body, and the head of a\nsure-footed Shetland pony, all stretched flat on the ground, and\nyou will have produced an accurate representation of a very\nlamentable fact.  And the moral device, Francis, of this picture\nwill be to testify that when gentlemen put confidence in the legs\nof Shetland ponies, they will find to their cost that they are\nleaning on nothing but broken reeds.  There is my first instance -\nand what have you got to say to that?’",
        "’Nothing, but that I want my hat,’ answered Goodchild, starting up\nand walking restlessly about the room.",
        "’You shall have it in a minute,’ rejoined Thomas.  ’My second\ninstance’ - (Goodchild groaned, and sat down again) - ’My second\ninstance is more appropriate to the present time and place, for it\nrefers to a race-horse.  Two years ago an excellent friend of mine,\nwho was desirous of prevailing on me to take regular exercise, and\nwho was well enough acquainted with the weakness of my legs to\nexpect no very active compliance with his wishes on their part,\noffered to make me a present of one of his horses.  Hearing that\nthe animal in question had started in life on the turf, I declined\naccepting the gift with many thanks; adding, by way of explanation,\nthat I looked on a race-horse as a kind of embodied hurricane, upon\nwhich no sane man of my character and habits could be expected to\nseat himself.  My friend replied that, however appropriate my\nmetaphor might be as applied to race-horses in general, it was\nsingularly unsuitable as applied to the particular horse which he\nproposed to give me.  From a foal upwards this remarkable animal\nhad been the idlest and most sluggish of his race.  Whatever\ncapacities for speed he might possess he had kept so strictly to\nhimself, that no amount of training had ever brought them out.  He\nhad been found hopelessly slow as a racer, and hopelessly lazy as a\nhunter, and was fit for nothing but a quiet, easy life of it with\nan old gentleman or an invalid.  When I heard this account of the\nhorse, I don’t mind confessing that my heart warmed to him.\nVisions of Thomas Idle ambling serenely on the back of a steed as\nlazy as himself, presenting to a restless world the soothing and\ncomposite spectacle of a kind of sluggardly Centaur, too peaceable\nin his habits to alarm anybody, swam attractively before my eyes.\nI went to look at the horse in the stable.  Nice fellow! he was\nfast asleep with a kitten on his back.  I saw him taken out for an\nairing by the groom.  If he had had trousers on his legs I should\nnot have known them from my own, so deliberately were they lifted\nup, so gently were they put down, so slowly did they get over the\nground.  From that moment I gratefully accepted my friend’s offer.\nI went home; the horse followed me - by a slow train.  Oh, Francis,\nhow devoutly I believed in that horse I how carefully I looked\nafter all his little comforts!  I had never gone the length of\nhiring a man-servant to wait on myself; but I went to the expense\nof hiring one to wait upon him.  If I thought a little of myself\nwhen I bought the softest saddle that could be had for money, I\nthought also of my horse.  When the man at the shop afterwards\noffered me spurs and a whip, I turned from him with horror.  When I\nsallied out for my first ride, I went purposely unarmed with the\nmeans of hurrying my steed.  He proceeded at his own pace every\nstep of the way; and when he stopped, at last, and blew out both\nhis sides with a heavy sigh, and turned his sleepy head and looked\nbehind him, I took him home again, as I might take home an artless\nchild who said to me, “If you please, sir, I am tired.”  For a week\nthis complete harmony between me and my horse lasted undisturbed.\nAt the end of that time, when he had made quite sure of my friendly\nconfidence in his laziness, when he had thoroughly acquainted\nhimself with all the little weaknesses of my seat (and their name\nis Legion), the smouldering treachery and ingratitude of the equine\nnature blazed out in an instant.  Without the slightest provocation\nfrom me, with nothing passing him at the time but a pony-chaise\ndriven by an old lady, he started in one instant from a state of\nsluggish depression to a state of frantic high spirits.  He kicked,\nhe plunged, he shied, he pranced, he capered fearfully.  I sat on\nhim as long as I could, and when I could sit no longer, I fell off.\nNo, Francis! this is not a circumstance to be laughed at, but to be\nwept over.  What would be said of a Man who had requited my\nkindness in that way?  Range over all the rest of the animal\ncreation, and where will you find me an instance of treachery so\nblack as this?  The cow that kicks down the milking-pail may have\nsome reason for it; she may think herself taxed too heavily to\ncontribute to the dilution of human tea and the greasing of human\nbread.  The tiger who springs out on me unawares has the excuse of\nbeing hungry at the time, to say nothing of the further\njustification of being a total stranger to me.  The very flea who\nsurprises me in my sleep may defend his act of assassination on the\nground that I, in my turn, am always ready to murder him when I am\nawake.  I defy the whole body of Natural Historians to move me,\nlogically, off the ground that I have taken in regard to the horse.\nReceive back your hat, Brother Francis, and go to the chemist’s, if\nyou please; for I have now done.  Ask me to take anything you like,\nexcept an interest in the Doncaster races.  Ask me to look at\nanything you like, except an assemblage of people all animated by\nfeelings of a friendly and admiring nature towards the horse.  You\nare a remarkably well-informed man, and you have heard of hermits.\nLook upon me as a member of that ancient fraternity, and you will\nsensibly add to the many obligations which Thomas Idle is proud to\nowe to Francis Goodchild.’",
        "Here, fatigued by the effort of excessive talking, disputatious\nThomas waved one hand languidly, laid his head back on the sofa-\npillow, and calmly closed his eyes.",
        "At a later period, Mr. Goodchild assailed his travelling companion\nboldly from the impregnable fortress of common sense.  But Thomas,\nthough tamed in body by drastic discipline, was still as mentally\nunapproachable as ever on the subject of his favourite delusion.",
        "The view from the window after Saturday’s breakfast is altogether\nchanged.  The tradesmen’s families have all come back again.  The\nserious stationer’s young woman of all work is shaking a duster out\nof the window of the combination breakfast-room; a child is playing\nwith a doll, where Mr. Thurtell’s hair was brushed; a sanitary\nscrubbing is in progress on the spot where Mr. Palmer’s braces were\nput on.  No signs of the Races are in the streets, but the tramps\nand the tumble-down-carts and trucks laden with drinking-forms and\ntables and remnants of booths, that are making their way out of the\ntown as fast as they can.  The Angel, which has been cleared for\naction all the week, already begins restoring every neat and\ncomfortable article of furniture to its own neat and comfortable\nplace.  The Angel’s daughters (pleasanter angels Mr. Idle and Mr.\nGoodchild never saw, nor more quietly expert in their business, nor\nmore superior to the common vice of being above it), have a little\ntime to rest, and to air their cheerful faces among the flowers in\nthe yard.  It is market-day.  The market looks unusually natural,\ncomfortable, and wholesome; the market-people too.  The town seems\nquite restored, when, hark! a metallic bray - The Gong-donkey!",
        "The wretched animal has not cleared off with the rest, but is here,\nunder the window.  How much more inconceivably drunk now, how much\nmore begrimed of paw, how much more tight of calico hide, how much\nmore stained and daubed and dirty and dunghilly, from his horrible\nbroom to his tender toes, who shall say!  He cannot even shake the\nbray out of himself now, without laying his cheek so near to the\nmud of the street, that he pitches over after delivering it.  Now,\nprone in the mud, and now backing himself up against shop-windows,\nthe owners of which come out in terror to remove him; now, in the\ndrinking-shop, and now in the tobacconist’s, where he goes to buy\ntobacco, and makes his way into the parlour, and where he gets a\ncigar, which in half-a-minute he forgets to smoke; now dancing, now\ndozing, now cursing, and now complimenting My Lord, the Colonel,\nthe Noble Captain, and Your Honourable Worship, the Gong-donkey\nkicks up his heels, occasionally braying, until suddenly, he\nbeholds the dearest friend he has in the world coming down the\nstreet.",
        "The dearest friend the Gong-donkey has in the world, is a sort of\nJackall, in a dull, mangy, black hide, of such small pieces that it\nlooks as if it were made of blacking bottles turned inside out and\ncobbled together.  The dearest friend in the world (inconceivably\ndrunk too) advances at the Gong-donkey, with a hand on each thigh,\nin a series of humorous springs and stops, wagging his head as he\ncomes.  The Gong-donkey regarding him with attention and with the\nwarmest affection, suddenly perceives that he is the greatest enemy\nhe has in the world, and hits him hard in the countenance.  The\nastonished Jackall closes with the Donkey, and they roll over and\nover in the mud, pummelling one another.  A Police Inspector,\nsupernaturally endowed with patience, who has long been looking on\nfrom the Guildhall-steps, says, to a myrmidon, ’Lock ’em up!  Bring\n’em in!’",
        "Appropriate finish to the Grand Race-Week.  The Gong-donkey,\ncaptive and last trace of it, conveyed into limbo, where they\ncannot do better than keep him until next Race-Week.  The Jackall\nis wanted too, and is much looked for, over the way and up and\ndown.  But, having had the good fortune to be undermost at the time\nof the capture, he has vanished into air.",
        "On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Goodchild walks out and looks at the\nCourse.  It is quite deserted; heaps of broken crockery and bottles\nare raised to its memory; and correct cards and other fragments of\npaper are blowing about it, as the regulation little paper-books,\ncarried by the French soldiers in their breasts, were seen, soon\nafter the battle was fought, blowing idly about the plains of\nWaterloo.",
        "Where will these present idle leaves be blown by the idle winds,\nand where will the last of them be one day lost and forgotten?
