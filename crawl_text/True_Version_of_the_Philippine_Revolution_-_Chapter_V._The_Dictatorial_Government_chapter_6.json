        "On the 24th May a Dictatorial Government was established, my\nfirst proclamation being issued that day announcing the system of\ngovernment then adopted and stating that I had assumed the duties\nand responsibilities of head of such government. Several copies of\nthis proclamation were delivered to Admiral Dewey and through the\nfavour of his good offices forwarded to the representatives of the\nForeign Powers then residing in Manila, notwithstanding our lack of\nintercourse with Manila.",
        "A few days later the Dictatorial Government was removed to the house\nformerly occupied by the Spanish Civil Governor of Cavite, because,\nowing to the great number of visitors from the provinces and the\nrapid increase of work the accommodation in the private house was\nwholly inadequate and too cramped. It was while quartered in the first\nmentioned house that glad tidings reached me of the arrival at Cavite\nof the long-expected arms expedition. The whole cargo, consisting of\n1,999 rifles and 200,000 rounds of ammunition, besides other special\nmunitions of war, was landed at the very same dock of the Arsenal,\nand was witnessed by the U.S.S. ’Petrel.”",
        "I immediately despatched a Commission to convey to the Admiral\nmy thanks for the trouble he had taken in sending to hurry up the\nexpedition. I also caused my Commissioners to inform the Admiral\nthat I had fixed the 31st May as the day when the Revolutionary\nForces should make a General attack upon the Spaniards. The Admiral\nreturned the compliment by sending his Secretary to congratulate\nme and my Government upon the activity and enthusiasm displayed in\npreparing for the campaign, but he suggested that it was advisable\nto postpone the opening of the campaign to a later date in order that\nthe insurgent troops might be better organized and better drilled. I\nreplied to the Admiral through his Secretary that there was no cause\nfor any anxiety for everything would be in perfect readiness by the\n31st and, moreover, that the Filipinos were very anxious to free\nthemselves from the galling Spanish yoke, that they would therefore\nfight and my troops would make up for any deficiency in discipline by\na display of fearlessness and determination to defeat the common enemy\nwhich would go far to ensure success, I was, I added, nevertheless\nprofoundly grateful to the Admiral for his friendly advice.",
        "I promptly gave orders for the distribution of the arms which had\njust arrived, sending some to various provinces and reserving the\nremainder for the revolutionaries of Kawit, the latter being smuggled\ninto the district of Alapang during the night of 27th May.",
