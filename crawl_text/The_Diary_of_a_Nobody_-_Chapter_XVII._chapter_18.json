        "Marriage of Daisy Mutlar and Murray Posh.  The dream of my life\nrealised.  Mr. Perkupp takes Lupin into the office.",
        "\nMarch 20. - To-day being the day on which Daisy Mutlar and Mr.\nMurray Posh are to be married, Lupin has gone with a friend to\nspend the day at Gravesend.  Lupin has been much cut-up over the\naffair, although he declares that he is glad it is off.  I wish he\nwould not go to so many music-halls, but one dare not say anything\nto him about it.  At the present moment he irritates me by singing\nall over the house some nonsense about “What’s the matter with\nGladstone?  He’s all right!  What’s the matter with Lupin?  He’s\nall right!”  I don’t think either of them is.  In the evening\nGowing called, and the chief topic of conversation was Daisy’s\nmarriage to Murray Posh.  I said:  “I was glad the matter was at an\nend, as Daisy would only have made a fool of Lupin.”  Gowing, with\nhis usual good taste, said:  “Oh, Master Lupin can make a fool of\nhimself without any assistance.”  Carrie very properly resented\nthis, and Gowing had sufficient sense to say he was sorry.",
        "March 21. - To-day I shall conclude my diary, for it is one of the\nhappiest days of my life.  My great dream of the last few weeks -\nin fact, of many years - has been realised.  This morning came a\nletter from Mr. Perkupp, asking me to take Lupin down to the office\nwith me.  I went to Lupin’s room; poor fellow, he seemed very pale,\nand said he had a bad headache.  He had come back yesterday from\nGravesend, where he spent part of the day in a small boat on the\nwater, having been mad enough to neglect to take his overcoat with\nhim.  I showed him Mr. Perkupp’s letter, and he got up as quickly\nas possible.  I begged of him not to put on his fast-coloured\nclothes and ties, but to dress in something black or quiet-looking.",
        "Carrie was all of a tremble when she read the letter, and all she\ncould keep on saying was:  “Oh, I DO hope it will be all right.\"\nFor myself, I could scarcely eat any breakfast.  Lupin came down\ndressed quietly, and looking a perfect gentleman, except that his\nface was rather yellow.  Carrie, by way of encouragement said:\n“You do look nice, Lupin.”  Lupin replied:  “Yes, it’s a good make-\nup, isn’t it?  A regular-downright-respectable-funereal-first-\nclass-City-firm-junior-clerk.”  He laughed rather ironically.",
        "In the hall I heard a great noise, and also Lupin shouting to Sarah\nto fetch down his old hat.  I went into the passage, and found\nLupin in a fury, kicking and smashing a new tall hat.  I said:\n“Lupin, my boy, what are you doing?  How wicked of you!  Some poor\nfellow would be glad to have it.”  Lupin replied:  “I would not\ninsult any poor fellow by giving it to him.”",
        "When he had gone outside, I picked up the battered hat, and saw\ninside “Posh’s Patent.”  Poor Lupin!  I can forgive him.  It seemed\nhours before we reached the office.  Mr. Perkupp sent for Lupin,\nwho was with him nearly an hour.  He returned, as I thought,\ncrestfallen in appearance.  I said:  “Well, Lupin, how about Mr.\nPerkupp?”  Lupin commenced his song:  “What’s the matter with\nPerkupp?  He’s all right!”  I felt instinctively my boy was\nengaged.  I went to Mr. Perkupp, but I could not speak.  He said:\n“Well, Mr. Pooter, what is it?”  I must have looked a fool, for all\nI could say was:  “Mr. Perkupp, you are a good man.”  He looked at\nme for a moment, and said:  “No, Mr. Pooter, YOU are the good man;\nand we’ll see if we cannot get your son to follow such an excellent\nexample.”  I said:  “Mr. Perkupp, may I go home?  I cannot work any\nmore to-day.”",
        "My good master shook my hand warmly as he nodded his head.  It was\nas much as I could do to prevent myself from crying in the ’bus; in\nfact, I should have done so, had my thoughts not been interrupted\nby Lupin, who was having a quarrel with a fat man in the ’bus, whom\nhe accused of taking up too much room.",
        "In the evening Carrie sent round for dear old friend Cummings and\nhis wife, and also to Gowing.  We all sat round the fire, and in a\nbottle of “Jackson Freres,” which Sarah fetched from the grocer’s,\ndrank Lupin’s health.  I lay awake for hours, thinking of the\nfuture.  My boy in the same office as myself - we can go down\ntogether by the ’bus, come home together, and who knows but in the\ncourse of time he may take great interest in our little home.  That\nhe may help me to put a nail in here or a nail in there, or help\nhis dear mother to hang a picture.  In the summer he may help us in\nour little garden with the flowers, and assist us to paint the\nstands and pots.  (By-the-by, I must get in some more enamel\npaint.)  All this I thought over and over again, and a thousand\nhappy thoughts beside.  I heard the clock strike four, and soon\nafter fell asleep, only to dream of three happy people - Lupin,\ndear Carrie, and myself.",
