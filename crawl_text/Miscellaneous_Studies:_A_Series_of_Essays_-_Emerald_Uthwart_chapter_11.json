        "[197] WE smile at epitaphs–at those recent enough to be read easily;\nsmile, for the most part, at what for the most part is an unreal and\noften vulgar branch of literature; yet a wide one, with its flowers\nhere or there, such as make us regret now and again not to have\ngathered more carefully in our wanderings a fair average of the like.\nTheir very simplicity, of course, may set one’s thoughts in motion to\nfill up the scanty tale, and those of the young at least are almost\nalways worth while.  At Siena, for instance, in the great Dominican\nchurch, even with the impassioned work of Sodoma at hand, you may\nlinger in a certain dimly lit chapel to spell out the black-letter\nmemorials of the German students who died here–aetatis flore!–at\nthe University, famous early in the last century; young nobles\nchiefly, far from the Rhine, from Nuremberg, or Leipsic.  Note one in\nparticular!  Loving parents and elder brother meant to record [198]\ncarefully the very days of the lad’s poor life–annos, menses, dies;\nsent the order, doubtless, from the distant old castle in the\nFatherland, but not quite explicitly; the spaces for the numbers\nremain still unfilled; and they never came to see.  After two\ncenturies the omission is not to be rectified; and the young man’s\nmemorial has perhaps its propriety as it stands, with those\nunnumbered, or numberless, days.  “Full of affections,” observed,\nonce upon a time, a great lover of boys and young men, speaking to a\nlarge company of them:–\"full of affections, full of powers, full of\noccupation, how naturally might the younger part of us especially\n(more naturally than the older) receive the tidings that there are\nthings to be loved and things to be done which shall never pass away.\nWe feel strong, we feel active, we feel full of life; and these\nfeelings do not altogether deceive us, for we shall live for ever.\nWe see a long prospect before us, for which it is worth while to\nwork, even with much labour; for we are as yet young, and the past\nportion of our lives is but small in comparison of that which\nprobably remains to us.  It is most true!  The past years of our life\nare absolutely beyond proportion small in comparison with those which\ncertainly remain to us.”",
        "In a very different neighbourhood, here at home, in a remote Sussex\nchurchyard, you may read that Emerald Uthwart was born on such a\n[199] day, “at Chase Lodge, in this parish; and died there,” on a day\nin the year 18–, aged twenty-six.  Think, thereupon, of the years of\na very English existence passed without a lost week in that bloomy\nEnglish place, amid its English lawns and flower-beds, its oldish\nbrick and raftered plaster; you may see it still, not far off, on a\nclearing of the wooded hill-side sloping gradually to the sea.  But\nyou think wrong.  Emerald Uthwart, in almost unbroken absence from\nhis home, longed greatly for it, but left it early and came back\nthere only to die, in disgrace, as he conceived; of which it was he\ndied there, finding the sense of the place all around him at last,\nlike blessed oil in one’s wounds.",
        "How they shook their musk from them!–those gardens, among which the\nyoungest son, but not the youngest child, grew up, little considered\ntill he returned there in those last years.  The rippling note of the\nbirds he distinguished so acutely seemed a part of this tree-less\nplace, open freely to sun and air, such as rose and carnation loved,\nin the midst of the old disafforested chase.  Brothers and sisters,\nall alike were gardeners, methodically intimate with their flowers.\nYou need words compact rather of perfume than of colour to describe\nthem, in nice annual order; terms for perfume, as immediate and\ndefinite as red, purple, and yellow.  Flowers there were which seemed\nto yield their sweetest in the faint sea-salt, when the loosening\nwind [200] was strong from the south-west; some which found their way\nslowly towards the neighbourhood of the old oaks and beech-trees.\nOthers consorted most freely with the wall-fruit, or seemed made for\npot-pourri to sweeten the old black mahogany furniture.  The sweet-\npea stacks loved the broad path through the kitchen garden; the old-\nfashioned garden azalea was the making of a nosegay, with its honey\nwhich clung to one’s finger.  There were flowers all the sweeter for\na battle with the rain; a flower like aromatic medicine; another like\nsummer lingering into winter; it ripened as fruit does; and another\nwas like August, his own birthday time, dropped into March.",
        "The very mould here, rich old black gardener’s earth, was flower-\nseed; and beyond, the fields, one after another, through the white\ngates breaking the well-grown hedge-rows, were hardly less garden-\nlike; little velvety fields, little with the true sweet English\nlittleness of our little island, our land of vignettes.  Here all was\nlittle; the very church where they went to pray, to sit, the ancient\nUthwarts sleeping all around outside under the windows, deposited\nthere as quietly as fallen trees on their native soil, and almost\nunrecorded, as there had been almost nothing to record; where\nhowever, Sunday after Sunday, Emerald Uthwart reads, wondering, the\nsolitary memorial of one soldierly member of his race, who had,–\nwell! who had not died here [201] at home, in his bed.  How wretched!\nhow fine! how inconceivably great and difficult!–not for him!  And\nyet, amid all its littleness, how large his sense of liberty in the\nplace he, the cadet doomed to leave it–his birth-place, where he is\nalso so early to die–had loved better than any one of them!\nEnjoying hitherto all the freedom of the almost grown-up brothers,\nthe unrepressed noise, the unchecked hours, the old rooms, all their\nown way, he is literally without the consciousness of rule.  Only,\nwhen the long irresponsible day is over, amid the dew, the odours, of\nsummer twilight, they roll their cricket-field against to-morrow’s\ngame.  So it had always been with the Uthwarts; they never went to\nschool.  In the great attic he has chosen for himself Emerald\nawakes;–it was a rule, sanitary, almost medical, never to rouse the\nchildren–rises to play betimes; or, if he choose, with window flung\nopen to the roses, the sea, turns to sleep again, deliberately,\ndeliciously, under the fine old blankets.",
        "A rather sensuous boy! you may suppose, amid the wholesome, natural\nself-indulgence of a very English home.  His days began there: it\nclosed again, after an interval of the larger number of them,\nindulgently, mercifully, round his end.  For awhile he became its\ncentre, old habits changing, the old furniture rearranged about him,\nfor the first time in many generations, though he left it now with\nsomething like [202] resentment in his heart, as if thrust harshly\naway, sent ablactatus a matre; made an effort thereon to snap the\nlast thread which bound him to it.  Yet it would come back upon him\nsometimes, amid so different a scene, as through a suddenly opened\ndoor, or a rent in the wall, with softer thoughts of his people,–\nthere, or not there,–and a sudden, dutiful effort on his part to\nrekindle wasting affection.",
        "The youngest of four sons, but not the youngest of the family!–you\nconceive the sort of negligence that creeps over even the kindest\nmaternities, in such case; unless, perhaps, sickness, or the sort of\nmisfortune, making the last first for the affectionate, that brought\nEmerald back at length to die contentedly, interferes with the way of\nnature.  Little by little he comes to understand that, while the\nbrothers are indulged with lessons at home, are some of them free\neven of these and placed already in the world, where, however, there\nremains no place for him, he is to go to school, chiefly for the\nconvenience of others–they are going to be much away from home!–\nthat now for the first time, as he says to himself, an old-English\nUthwart is to pass under the yoke.  The tutor in the house, meantime,\naware of some fascination in the lad, teaches him, at his own\nirregularly chosen hours, more carefully than the others; exerts all\nhis gifts for the purpose, winning him on almost insensibly to\nyouthful proficiency in those difficult rudiments.",
        "[203] See him as he stands, seemingly rooted in the spot where he has\ncome to flower!  He departs, however, a few days before the departure\nof the rest–some to foreign parts, the brothers, who shut up the old\nplace, to town.  For a moment, he makes an effort to figure to\nhimself those coming absences as but exceptional intervals in his\nlife here; he will count the days, going more quickly so; find his\npleasure in watching the sands fall, as even the sands of time at\nschool must.  In fact, he was scarcely ever to lie at ease here\nagain, till he came to take his final leave of it, lying at his\nlength so.  In brief holidays he rejoins his people, anywhere,\nanyhow, in a sort of hurry and makeshift:–Flos Parietis! thus\ncarelessly plucked forth.  Emerald Uthwart was born on such a day “at\nChase Lodge, in this parish, and died there.”",
        "See him then as he stands! counting now the hours that remain, on the\neve of that first emigration, and look away next at the other place,\nwhich through centuries has been forming to receive him; from those\ngarden-beds, now at their richest, but where all is so winsomely\nlittle, to that place of “great matters,” great stones, great\nmemories out of reach.  Why! the Uthwarts had scarcely had more\nmemories than their woods, noiselessly deciduous; or their\nprehistoric, entirely unprogressive, unrecording forefathers, in or\nbefore the days of the Druids.  Centuries of almost “still” life–of\nbirth, death, [204] and the rest, as merely natural processes–had\nmade them and their home what we find them.  Centuries of conscious\nendeavour, on the other hand, had builded, shaped, and coloured the\nplace, a small cell, which Emerald Uthwart was now to occupy; a place\nsuch as our most characteristic English education has rightly tended\nto “find itself a house” in–a place full, for those who came within\nits influence, of a will of its own.  Here everything, one’s very\ngames, have gone by rule onwards from the dim old monastic days, and\nthe Benedictine school for novices with the wholesome severities\nwhich have descended to our own time.  Like its customs,–there’s a\nbook in the cathedral archives with the names, for centuries Past, of\nthe “scholars” who have missed church at the proper times for going\nthere–like its customs, well-worn yet well-preserved, time-stained,\ntime-engrained, time-mellowed, the venerable Norman or English stones\nof this austere, beautifully proportioned place look like marble, to\nwhich Emerald’s softly nurtured being, his careless wild-growth must\nnow adapt itself, though somewhat painfully recoiling from contact\nwith what seems so hard also, and bright, and cold.  From his native\nworld of soft garden touches, carnation and rose (they had been\neverywhere in those last weeks), where every one did just what he\nliked, he was passed now to this world of grey stone; and here it was\nalways the decisive word [205] of command.  That old warrior\nUthwart’s record in the church at home, so fine, yet so wretched, so\nunspeakably great and difficult! seemed written here everywhere\naround him, as he stood feeling himself fit only to be taught, to be\ndrilled into, his small compartment; in every movement of his\ncompanions, with their quaint confining little cloth gowns; in the\nkeen, clear, well-authorised dominancy of some, the instant\nsubmission of others.  In fact, by one of our wise English\ncompromises, we still teach our so modern boys the Classics; a lesson\nin attention and patience, at the least.  Nay! by a double\ncompromise, with delightful physiognomic results sometimes, we teach\nthem their pagan Latin and Greek under the shadow of medieval church-\ntowers, amid the haunts, the traditions, and with something of the\ndiscipline, of monasticism; for which, as is noticeable, the English\nhave never wholly lost an early inclination.  The French and others\nhave swept their scholastic houses empty of it, with pedantic\nfidelity to their theories.  English pedants may succeed in doing the\nlike.  But the result of our older method has had its value so far,\nat least, say! for the careful aesthetic observer.  It is of such\ndiagonal influences, through complication of influence, that\nexpression comes, in life, in our culture, in the very faces of men\nand boys–of these boys.  Nothing could better harmonise present with\npast than the sight of them just here, as they [206] shout at their\ngames, or recite their lessons, over-arched by the work of medieval\npriors, or pass to church meekly, into the seats occupied by the\nyoung monks before them.",
        "If summer comes reluctantly to our English shores, it is also apt to\nlinger with us;–its flora of red and gold leaves on the branches\nwellnigh to Christmas; the hot days that surprise you, and persist,\nthough heralded by white mornings, hinting that it is but the year’s\nindulgence so to deal with us.  To the fanciful, such days may seem\nmost at home in the places where England has thus preferred to locate\nthe somewhat pensive education of its more favoured youth.  As\nUthwart passes through the old ecclesiastical city, upon which any\nmore modern touch, modern door or window, seems a thing out of place\nthrough negligence, the diluted sunlight itself seems driven along\nwith a sparing trace of gilded vane or red tile in it, under the\nwholesome active wind from the East coast.  The long, finely\nweathered, leaden roof, and the great square tower, gravely\nmagnificent, emphatic from the first view of it over the grey down\nabove the hop-gardens, the gently-watered meadows, dwarf now\neverything beside; have the bigness of nature’s work, seated up there\nso steadily amid the winds, as rain and fog and heat pass by.  More\nand more persistently, as he proceeds, in the “Green Court” at last,\nthey occupy the outlook.  He is shown the narrow [207] cubicle in\nwhich he is to sleep; and there it still is, with nothing else, in\nthe window-pane, as he lies;–\"our tower,” the “Angel Steeple,\"\nnoblest of its kind.  Here, from morning to night, everything seems\nchallenged to follow the upward lead of its long, bold,\n“perpendicular” lines.  The very place one is in, its stone-work, its\nempty spaces, invade you; invade all who belong to them, as Uthwart\nbelongs, yielding wholly from the first; seem to question you\nmasterfully as to your purpose in being here at all, amid the great\nmemories of the past, of this school;–challenge you, so to speak, to\nmake moral philosophy one of your acquirements, if you can, and to\nsystematise your vagrant self; which however will in any case be here\nsystematised for you.  In Uthwart, then, is the plain tablet, for the\ninfluences of place to inscribe.  Say if you will, that he is under\nthe power of an “embodied ideal,” somewhat repellent, but which he\ncannot despise.  He sits in the schoolroom–ancient, transformed\nchapel of the pilgrims; sits in the sober white and brown place, at\nthe heavy old desks, carved this way and that, crowded as an old\nchurchyard with forgotten names, side by side with sympathetic or\nantipathetic competitors, as it may chance.  In a delightful, exactly\nmeasured, quarter of an hour’s rest, they come about him, seem to\nwish to be friends at once, good and bad alike, dull and clever;\nwonder a little at the name, and [208] the owner.  A family name–he\nexplains, good-humouredly; tries to tell some story no one could ever\nremember precisely of the ancestor from whom it came, the one story\nof the Uthwarts; is spared; nay! petulantly forbidden to proceed.\nBut the name sticks the faster.  Nicknames mark, for the most part,\npopularity.  Emerald! so every one called Uthwart, but shortened to\nAldy.  They disperse; flock out into the court; acquaint him hastily\nwith the curiosities of the Precincts, the “dark entry,” the rich\nheraldries of the blackened and mouldering cloister, the ruined\novergrown spaces where the old monastery stood, the stones of which\nfurnished material for the rambling prebends houses, now\n“antediluvian” in their turn; are ready also to climb the scaffold-\npoles always to be found somewhere about the great church, or dive\nalong the odd, secret passages of the old builders, with quite\nlearned explanations (being proud of, and therefore painstaking\nabout, the place) of architectural periods, of Gothic “late” and\n“early,” layer upon layer, down to round-arched “Norman,” like the\nfamous staircase of their school.",
        "The reader comprehends that Uthwart was come where the genius loci\nwas a strong one, with a claim to mould all who enter it to a\nperfect, uninquiring, willing or unwilling, conformity to itself.  On\nSaturday half-holidays the scholars are taken to church in their\nsurplices, across the [209] court, under the lime-trees; emerge at\nlast up the dark winding passages into the melodious, mellow-lighted\nspace, always three days behind the temperature outside, so thick are\nthe walls;–how warm and nice! how cool and nice!  The choir, to\nwhich they glide in order to their places below the clergy, seems\nconspicuously cold and sad.  But the empty chapels lying beyond it\nall about into the distance are a trap on sunny mornings for the\nclouds of yellow effulgence.  The Angel Steeple is a lantern within,\nand sheds down a flood of the like just beyond the gates.  You can\npeep up into it where you sit, if you dare to gaze about you.  If at\nhome there had been nothing great, here, to boyish sense, one seems\ndiminished to nothing at all, amid the grand waves, wave upon wave,\nof patiently-wrought stone; the daring height, the daring severity,\nof the innumerable, long, upward, ruled lines, rigidly bent just at\nlast, in due place, into the reserved grace of the perfect Gothic\narch; the peculiar daylight which seemed to come from further than\nthe light outside.  Next morning they are here again.  In contrast to\nthose irregularly broken hours at home, the passive length of things\nimpresses Uthwart now.  It develops patience–that tale of hours, the\nlong chanted English service; our English manner of education is a\ndevelopment of patience, of decorous and mannerly patience.  “It is\ngood for a man that he bear the yoke in [210] his youth: he putteth\nhis mouth in the dust, he keepeth silence, because he hath borne it\nupon him.\"–They have this for an anthem; sung however to wonderfully\ncheerful and sprightly music, as if one liked the thought.",
        "The aim of a veritable community, says Plato, is not that this or\nthat member of it should be disproportionately at ease, but that the\nwhole should flourish; though indeed such general welfare might come\nround again to the loyal unit therein, and rest with him, as a\nprivilege of his individual being after all.  The social type he\npreferred, as we know, was conservative Sparta and its youth; whose\nunsparing discipline had doubtless something to do with the fact that\nit was the handsomest and best-formed in all Greece.  A school is not\nmade for one.  It would misrepresent Uthwart’s wholly unconscious\nhumility to say that he felt the beauty of the askesis+ (we need that\nGreek word) to which he not merely finds himself subject, but as\nunder a fascination submissively yields himself, although another\nmight have been aware of the charm of it, half ethic, half physical,\nas visibly effective in him.  Its peculiarity would have lain in the\nexpression of a stress upon him and his customary daily existence,\nbeyond what any definitely proposed issue of it, at least for the\nmoment, explained.  Something of that is involved in the very idea of\na classical education, at least for such as he; in its seeming\nindirectness [211] or lack of purpose, amid so much difficulty, as\ncontrasted with forms of education more obviously useful or\npractical.  He found himself in a system of fixed rules, amid which,\nit might be, some of his own tendencies and inclinations would die\nout of him through disuse.  The confident word of command, the\ninstantaneous obedience expected, the enforced silence, the very\ngames that go by rule, a sort of hardness natural to wholesome\nEnglish youths when they come together, but here de rigueur as a\npoint of good manners;–he accepts all these without hesitation; the\nearly hours also, naturally distasteful to him, which gave to actual\nmorning, to all that had passed in it, when in more self-conscious\nmood he looked back on the morning of life, a preponderance, a\ndisproportionate place there, adding greatly to the effect of its\ndreamy distance from him at this later time;–an ideal quality, he\nmight have said, had he ever used such words as that.",
        "Uthwart duly passes his examination; and, in their own chapel in the\ntransept of the choir, lighted up late for evening prayer after the\nlong day of trial, is received to the full privileges of a Scholar\nwith the accustomed Latin words:–Introitum tuum et exitum tuum\ncustodiat Dominus!  He takes them, not to heart, but rather to mind,\nas few, if they so much as heard them, were wont to do; ponders them\nfor a while.  They seem scarcely meant for him–words like those!\n[212] increase however his sense of responsibility to the place, of\nwhich he is now more exclusively than before a part–that he belongs\nto it, its great memories, great dim purposes; deepen the\nconsciousness he had on first coming hither of a demand in the world\nabout him, whereof the very stones are emphatic, to which no average\nhuman creature could be sufficient; of reproof, reproaches, of this\nor that in himself.",
        "It was reported, there was a funny belief, at school, that Aldy\nUthwart had no feeling and was incapable of tears.  They never came\nto him certainly, when, at nights for the most part, the very touch\nof home, so soft, yet so indifferent to him, reached him, with a\nsudden opulent rush of garden perfumes; came at the rattling of the\nwindow-pane in the wind, with anything that expressed distance from\nthe bare white walls around him here.  He thrust it from him\nbrusquely, being of a practical turn, and, though somewhat sensuous,\nwholly without sentimentality.  There is something however in the\nlad’s soldier-like, impassible self-command, in his sustained\nexpression of a certain indifference to things, which awakes suddenly\nall the sentiment, the poetry, latent hitherto in another–James\nStokes, the prefect, his immediate superior; awakes for the first\ntime into ample flower something of genius in a seemingly plodding\nscholar, and therewith also something of the waywardness popularly\nthought to belong to [213] genius.  Preceptores, condiscipuli, alike,\nmarvel at a sort of delicacy coming into the habits, the person, of\nthat tall, bashful, broad-shouldered, very Kentish, lad; so\nunaffectedly nevertheless, that it is understood after all to be but\nthe smartness properly significant of change to early manhood, like\nthe down on his lip.  Wistful anticipations of manhood are in fact\naroused in him, thoughts of the future; his ambition takes effective\noutline.  The well-worn, perhaps conventional, beauties of their\n“dead” Greek and Latin books, associated directly now with the living\ncompanion beside him, really shine for him at last with their\npristine freshness; seem more than to fulfil their claim upon the\npatience, the attention, of modern youth.  He notices as never before\nminute points of meaning in Homer, in Virgil; points out thus, for\ninstance, to his junior, one day in the sunshine, how the Greeks had\na special word for the Fate which accompanied one who would come to a\nviolent end.  The common Destinies of men, Moirai,+ Moerae–they\naccompanied all men indifferently.  But Ker,+ the extraordinary\nDestiny, one’s Doom, had a scent for distant blood-shedding; and, to\nbe in at a sanguinary death, one of their number came forth to the\nvery cradle, followed persistently all the way, over the waves,\nthrough powder and shot, through the rose-gardens;–where not?\nLooking back, one might trace the red footsteps all along, side by\n[214] side.  (Emerald Uthwart, you remember, was to “die there,” of\nlingering sickness, in disgrace, as he fancied, while the word glory\ncame to be softly whispered of them and of their end.) Classic\nfelicities, the choice expressions, with which James Stokes has so\npatiently stored his memory, furnish now a dainty embroidery upon\nevery act, every change in time or place, of their daily life in\ncommon.  He finds the Greek or the Latin model of their antique\nfriendship or tries to find it, in the books they read together.\nNone fits exactly.  It is of military glory they are really thinking,\namid those ecclesiastical surroundings, where however surplices and\nuniforms are often mingled together; how they will lie, in costly\nglory, costly to them, side by side, (as they work and walk and play\nnow, side by side) in the cathedral aisle, with a tattered flag\nperhaps above them, and under a single epitaph, like that of those\ntwo older scholars, Ensigns, Signiferi, in their respective\nregiments, in hac ecclesia pueri instituti,+ with the sapphic stanza\nin imitation of the Horace they had learned here, written by their\nold master.",
        "Horace!–he was, had been always, the idol of their school; to know\nhim by heart, to translate him into effective English idiom, have an\napt phrase of his instinctively on one’s lips for every occasion.\nThat boys should be made to spout him under penalties, would have\nseemed doubtless to that sensitive, vain, winsome poet, [215] even\nmore than to grim Juvenal, quite the sorriest of fates; might have\nseemed not so bad however, could he, from the “ashes” so persistently\nin his thoughts, have peeped on these English boys, row upon row,\nwith black or golden heads, repeating him in the fresh morning, and\nobserved how well for once the thing was done; how well he was\nunderstood by English James Stokes, feeling the old “fire” really\n“quick” still, under the influence which now in truth quickened,\nenlivened, everything around him.  The old heathen’s way of looking\nat things, his melodious expression of it, blends, or contrasts\nitself oddly with the everyday detail, with the very stones, the\nGothic stones, of a world he could hardly have conceived, its\nmedieval surroundings, their half-clerical life here.  Yet not so\ninconsistently after all!  The builders of these aisles and cloisters\nhad known and valued as much of him as they could come by in their\nown un-instructed time; had built up their intellectual edifice more\nthan they were aware of from fragments of pagan thought, as, quite\nconsciously, they constructed their churches of old Roman bricks and\npillars, or frank imitations of them.  One’s day, then, began with\nhim, for all alike, Sundays of course excepted,–with an Ode, learned\nover-night by the prudent, who, observing how readily the words which\nsend us to sleep cling to the brain and seem an inherent part of it\nnext morning, kept him under [216] their pillows.  Prefects, without\na book, heard the repetition of the Juniors, must be able to correct\ntheir blunders.  Odes and Epodes, thus acquired, were a score of days\nand weeks; alcaic and sapphic verses like a bead-roll for counting\noff the time that intervened before the holidays.  Time–that tardy\nservant of youthful appetite–brought them soon enough to the point\nwhere they desired in vain “to see one of” those days, erased now so\nwillingly; and sentimental James Stokes has already a sense that this\n“pause ’twixt cup and lip” of life is really worth pausing over,\nworth deliberation:–all this poetry, yes! poetry, surely, of their\nalternate work and play; light and shade, call it!  Had it been,\nafter all, a life in itself less commonplace than theirs–that life,\nthe trivial details of which their Horace had touched so daintily,\ngilded with real gold words?",
        "Regular, submissive, dutiful to play also, Aldy meantime enjoys his\ntriumphs in the Green Court; loves best however to run a paper-chase\nafar over the marshes, till you come in sight, or within scent, of\nthe sea, in the autumn twilight; and his dutifulness to games at\nleast had its full reward.  A wonderful hit of his at cricket was\nlong remembered; right over the lime-trees on to the cathedral roof,\nwas it? or over the roof, and onward into space, circling there\nindependently, minutely, as Sidus Cantiorum?  A comic poem on it in\nLatin, and a pretty one in English, [217] were penned by James\nStokes, still not so serious but that he forgets time altogether one\nday, in a manner the converse of exemplary in a prefect, whereupon\nUthwart, his companion as usual, manages to take all the blame, and\nthe due penalty next morning.  Stokes accepted the sacrifice the more\nreadily, believing–he too–that Aldy was “incapable of pain.”  What\nsurprised those who were in the secret was that, when it was over, he\nrose, and facing the head-master–could it be insolence? or was it\nthe sense of untruthfulness in his friendly action, or sense of the\nuniversal peccancy of all boys and men?–said submissively: “And now,\nsir, that I have taken my punishment, I hope you will forgive my\nfault.”",
        "Submissiveness!–It had the force of genius with Emerald Uthwart.  In\nthat very matter he had but yielded to a senior against his own\ninclination.  What he felt in Horace was the sense, original, active,\npersonal, of “things too high for me!”, the sense, not really\nunpleasing to him, of an unattainable height here too, in this royal\nfelicity of utterance, this literary art, the minute cares of which\nhad been really designed for the minute carefulness of a disciple\nsuch as this–all attention.  Well! the sense of authority, of a\nlarge intellectual authority over us, impressed anew day after day,\nof some impenetrable glory round “the masters of those who know,” is,\nof course, one of the effects we [218] look for from a classical\neducation:–that, and a full estimate of the preponderating value of\nthe manner of the doing of it in the thing done; which again, for\ningenuous youth, is an encouragement of good manners on its part:–\"I\nbehave myself orderly.”  Just at those points, scholarship attains\nsomething of a religious colour.  And in that place, religion,\nreligious system, its claim to overpower one, presented itself in a\nway of which even the least serious by nature could not be unaware.\nTheir great church, its customs and traditions, formed an element in\nthat esprit de corps into which the boyish mind throws itself so\nreadily.  Afterwards, in very different scenes, the sentiment of that\nplace would come back upon him, as if resentfully, by contrast with\nthe conscious or unconscious profanities of others, crushed out about\nhim straightway, by the shadow of awe, the minatory flash, felt\naround his unopened lips, in the glance, the changed manner.  Not to\nbe “occupied with great matters” recommends in heavenly places, as we\nknow, the souls of some.  Yet there were a few to whom it seemed\nunfortunate that religion whose flag Uthwart would have borne in\nhands so pure, touched him from first to last, and till his eyes were\nfinally closed on this world, only, again, as a thing immeasurable,\nsurely not meant for the like of him; its high claims, to which no\none could be equal; its reproaches.  He would scarcely have proposed\nto “enter into” [219] such matters; was constitutionally shy of them.\nHis submissiveness, you see, was a kind of genius; made him\ntherefore, of course, unlike those around him; was a secret; a thing,\nyou might say, “which no one knoweth, saving he that receiveth it.”",
        "Thus repressible, self-restrained, always concurring with the\ninfluence, the claim upon him, the rebuke, of others, in the bustle\nof school life he did not count even with those who knew him best,\nwith those who taught him, for the intellectual capacity he really\nhad.  In every generation of schoolboys there are a few who find out,\nalmost for themselves, the beauty and power of good literature, even\nin the literature they must read perforce; and this, in turn, is but\nthe handsel of a beauty and power still active in the actual world,\nshould they have the good fortune, or rather, acquire the skill, to\ndeal with it properly.  It has something of the stir and unction–\nthis intellectual awaking with a leap–of the coming of love.  So it\nwas with Uthwart about his seventeenth year.  He felt it, felt the\nintellectual passion, like the pressure outward of wings within him–\nhe pterou dynamis,+ says Plato, in the Phaedrus; but again, as some do\nwith everyday love, withheld, restrained himself; the status of a\nfreeman in the world of intellect can hardly be for him.  The sense\nof intellectual ambition, ambitious thoughts such as sweeten the toil\nof some of those about him, [220] coming to him once in a way, he is\nfrankly recommended to put them aside, and acquiesces; puts them from\nhim once for all, as he could do with besetting thoughts and\nfeelings, his preferences, (as he had put aside soft thoughts of home\nas a disobedience to rule) and with a countenance more good-humoured\nthan ever, an absolute placidity.  It is fit he should be treated\nsparingly in this matter of intellectual enjoyment.  He is made to\nunderstand that there is at least a score of others as good scholars\nas he.  He will have of course all the pains, but must not expect the\nprizes, of his work; of his loyal, incessant, cheerful industry.",
        "But only see him as he goes.  It is as if he left music, delightfully\nthrobbing music, or flowers, behind him, as he passes, careless of\nthem, unconsciously, through the world, the school, the precincts,\nthe old city.  Strangers’ eyes, resting on him by chance, are\ndeterred for a while, even among the rich sights of the venerable\nplace, as he walks out and in, in his prim gown and purple-tasselled\ncap; goes in, with the stream of sunlight, through the black shadows\nof the mouldering Gothic gateway, like youth’s very self, eternal,\nimmemorial, eternally renewed, about those immemorially ancient\nstones.  “Young Apollo!” people say–people who have pigeon-holes for\ntheir impressions, watching the slim, trim figure with the exercise\nbooks.  His very dress seems touched [221] with Hellenic fitness to\nthe healthy youthful form.  “Golden-haired, scholar Apollo!” they\nrepeat, foolishly, ignorantly.  He was better; was more like a real\nportrait of a real young Greek, like Tryphon, Son of Eutychos, for\ninstance, (as friends remembered him with regret, as you may see him\nstill on his tombstone in the British Museum) alive among the paler\nphysical and intellectual lights of modern England, under the old\nmonastic stonework of the Middle Age.  That theatrical old Greek god\nnever took the expressiveness, the lines of delicate meaning, such as\nwere come into the face of the English lad, the physiognomy of his\nrace; ennobled now, as if by the writing, the signature, there, of a\ngrave intelligence, by grave information and a subdued will, though\nwithout a touch of melancholy in this “best of playfellows.”  A\nmusical composer’s notes, we know, are not themselves till the fit\nexecutant comes, who can put all they may be into them.  The somewhat\nunmeaningly handsome facial type of the Uthwarts, moulded to a mere\nanimal or physical perfection through wholesome centuries, is\nbreathed on now, informed, by the touches, traces, complex influences\nfrom past and present a thousandfold, crossing each other in this\nlate century, and yet at unity in the simple law of the system to\nwhich he is now subject.  Coming thus upon an otherwise vigorous and\nhealthy nature, an untainted [222] physique, and limited by it, those\ncombining mental influences leave the firm unconscious simplicity of\nthe boyish nature still unperplexed.  The sisters, their friends,\nwhen he comes rarely upon them in foreign places, are proud of the\nschoolboy’s company–to walk at his side; the brothers, when he sees\nthem for a day, more considerate than of old.  Everywhere he leaves\nbehind him an odd regret for his presence, as he in turn wonders\nsometimes at the deference paid to one so unimportant as himself by\nthose he meets by accident perhaps; at the ease, for example, with\nwhich he attains to the social privileges denied to others.",
        "They tell him, he knows it already, he would “do for the army.\"\n“Yes! that would suit you,” people observe at once, when he tells\nthem what “he is to be\"–undoubtedly suit him, that dainty, military,\nvery English kind of pride, in seeming precisely what one is, neither\nmore nor less.  And the first mention of Uthwart’s purpose defines\nalso the vague outlooks of James Stokes, who will be a soldier too.\nUniforms, their scarlet and white and blue, spruce leather and steel,\nand gold lace, enlivening the old oak stalls at service time–\nuniforms and surplices were always close together here, where a\nmilitary garrison had been established in the suburbs for centuries\npast, and there were always sons of its officers in the school.  If\nyou stole out of an evening, it was like a stage scene– [223] nay!\nlike the Middle Age, itself, with this multitude of soldiers mingling\nin the crowd which filled the unchanged, gabled streets.  A military\ntradition had been continuous, from the days of crusading knights who\nlay humbly on their backs in the “Warriors’ Chapel” to the time of\nthe civil wars, when a certain heroic youth of eighteen was brought\nto rest there, onward to Dutch and American wars, and to Harry, and\nGeoffrey, and another James also, in hac ecclesia pueri instituti.\nIt was not so long since one of them sat on those very benches in the\nsixth form; had come back and entered the school, in full uniform, to\nsay good-bye!  Then the “colours” of his regiment had been brought,\nto be deposited by Dean and Canons in the cathedral; and a few weeks\nlater they had passed, scholars and the rest in long procession, to\ndeposit Ensign–himself there under his flag, or what remained of it,\na sorry, tattered fringe, along the staff he had borne out of the\nbattle at the cost of his life, as a little tablet explained.  There\nwere others in similar terms.  Alas! for that extraordinary,\npeculiarly-named, Destiny, or Doom, appointed to walk side by side\nwith one or another, aware from the first, but never warning him,\ntill the random or well-considered shot comes.",
        "Meantime however, the University, with work in preparation thereto,\nfills up the thoughts, the hours, of these would-be soldiers, of\nJames [224] Stokes, and therefore of Emerald Uthwart, through the\nlong summer-time, till the Green Court is fragrant with lime-blossom,\nand speech-day comes, on which, after their flower-service and sermon\nfrom an old comrade, Emerald surprises masters and companions by the\nfine quality of a recitation; still more when “Scholar Stokes” and he\nare found bracketed together as “Victors” of the school, who will\nproceed together to Oxford.  His speech in the Chapter-house was from\nthat place in Homer, where the soul of the lad Elpenor, killed by\naccident, entreats Ulysses for due burial rites.  “Fix my oar over my\ngrave,” he says, “the oar I rowed with when I lived, when I went with\nmy companions.”  And in effect what surprised, charmed the hearers\nwas the scruple with which those naturally graceful lips dealt with\nevery word, every syllable, put upon them.  He seemed to be thinking\nonly of his author, except for just so much of self-consciousness as\nwas involved in the fact that he seemed also to be speaking a little\nagainst his will; like a monk, it might be said, who sings in choir\nwith a really fine voice, but at the bidding of his superior, and\ncounting the notes all the while till his task be done, because his\nwhole nature revolts from so much as the bare opportunity for\npersonal display.  It was his duty to speak on the occasion.  They\nhad always been great in speech-making, in theatricals, from before\n[225] the days when the Puritans destroyed the Dean’s “Great Hall\"\nbecause “the King’s Scholars had profaned it by acting plays there\";\nand that peculiar note or accent, as being conspicuously free from\nthe egotism which vulgarises most of us, seemed to befit the person\nof Emerald, impressing weary listeners pleasantly as a novelty in\nthat kind.  Singular!–The words, because seemingly forced from him,\nhad been worth hearing.  The cheers, the “Kentish Fire,” of their\ncompanions might have broken down the crumbling black arches of the\nold cloister, or roused the dead under foot, as the “Victors” came\nout of the Chapter-house side by side; side by side also out of that\ndelightful period of their life at school, to proceed in due course\nto the University.",
        "They left it precipitately, after brief residence there, taking\nadvantage of a sudden outbreak of war to join the army at once,\nregretted–James Stokes for his high academic promise, Uthwart for a\nquality, or group of qualities, not strictly to be defined.  He\nseemed, in short, to harmonise by their combination in himself all\nthe various qualities proper to a large and varied community of\nyouths of nineteen or twenty, to which, when actually present there,\nhe was felt from hour to hour to be indispensable.  In fact school\nhabits and standards had survived in a world not so different from\nthat of school for those who are faithful to its type.  When he\nlooked back upon [226] it a little later, college seemed to him,\nseemed indeed at the time, had he ventured to admit it, a strange\nprolongation of boyhood, in its provisional character, the narrow\nlimitation of its duties and responsibility, the very divisions of\none’s day, the routine of play and work, its formal, perhaps pedantic\nrules.  The veritable plunge from youth into manhood came when one\npassed finally through those old Gothic gates, from a somewhat dreamy\nor problematic preparation for it, into the world of peremptory\nfacts.  A college, like a school, is not made for one; and as Uthwart\nsat there, still but a scholar, still reading with care the books\nprescribed for him by others–Greek and Latin books–the contrast\nbetween his own position and that of the majority of his coevals\nalready at the business of life impressed itself sometimes with an\nodd sense of unreality in the place around him.  Yet the schoolboy’s\nsensitive awe for the great things of the intellectual world had but\nmatured itself, and was at its height here amid this larger\ncompetition, which left him more than ever to find in doing his best\nsubmissively the sole reward of so doing.  He needs now in fact less\nrepression than encouragement not to be a “passman,” as he may if he\nlikes, acquiescing in a lowly measure of culture which certainly will\nnot manufacture Miltons, nor turn serge into silk, broom-blossom into\nverbenas, but only, perhaps not so faultily, leave Emerald Uthwart\nand the like of him [227] essentially what they are.  “He holds his\nbook in a peculiar way,” notes in manuscript one of his tutors;\n“holds on to it with both hands; clings as if from below, just as his\ntough little mind clings to the sense of the Greek words he can\nEnglish so closely, precisely.”  Again, as at school, he had put his\nneck under the yoke; though he has now also much reading quite at his\nown choice; by preference, when he can come by such, about the place\nwhere he finds himself, about the earlier youthful occupants, if it\nmight be, of his own quaint rooms on the second floor just below the\nroof; of what he can see from his windows in the old black front\neastwards, with its inestimable patina of ancient smoke and weather\nand natural decay (when you look close the very stone is a composite\nof minute dead bodies) relieving heads like his so effectively on\nsummer mornings.  On summer nights the scent of the hay, the wild-\nflowers, comes across the narrow fringe of town to right and left;\nseems to come from beyond the Oxford meadows, with sensitive, half-\nrepellent thoughts from the gardens at home.  He looks down upon the\ngreen square with the slim, quaint, black, young figures that cross\nit on the way to chapel on yellow Sunday mornings, or upwards to the\ndome, the spire; can watch them closely in freakish moonlight, or\nflickering softly by an occasional bonfire in the quadrangle behind\nhim.  Yet how hard, how forbidding sometimes, under [228] a late\nstormy sky, the scheme of black, white, and grey, to which the group\nof ancient buildings could attune itself.  And what he reads most\nreadily is of the military life that intruded itself so oddly, during\nthe Civil War, into these half-monastic places, till the timid old\nacademic world scarcely knew itself.  He treasures then every\nincident which connects a soldier’s coat with any still recognisable\nobject, wall, or tree, or garden-walk; that walk, for instance, under\nMerton garden where young Colonel Windebank was shot for a traitor.\nHis body lies in Saint Mary Magdalen’s churchyard.  Unassociated to\nsuch incident, the mere beauties of the place counted at the moment\nfor less than in retrospect.  It was almost retrospect even now, with\nan anticipation of regret, in rare moments of solitude perhaps, when\nthe oars splashed far up the narrow streamlets through the fields on\nMay evenings among the fritillaries–does the reader know them? that\nstrange remnant just here of a richer extinct flora–dry flowers,\nthough with a drop of dubious honey in each.  Snakes’ heads, the rude\ncall them, for their shape, scale-marked too, and in colour like\nrusted blood, as if they grew from some forgotten battle-field, the\nbodies, the rotten armour–yet delicate, beautiful, waving proudly.\nIn truth the memory of Oxford made almost everything he saw after it\nseem vulgar.  But he feels also nevertheless, characteristically,\nthat such local pride (fastus he terms it) is proper [229] only for\nthose whose occupations are wholly congruous with it; for the gifted,\nthe freemen who can enter into the genius, who possess the liberty,\nof the place; that it has a reproach in it for the outsider, which\ncomes home to him.",
        "Here again then as he passes through the world, so delightfully to\nothers, they tell him, as if weighing him, his very self, against his\nmerely scholastic capacity and effects, that he would “do for the\narmy\"; which he is now wholly glad to hear, for from first to last,\nthrough all his successes there, the army had still been scholar\nStokes’ choice, and he had no difficulty, as the reader sees, in\nkeeping Uthwart also faithful to first intentions.  Their names were\nalready entered for commissions; but the war breaking out afresh,\ninformation reaches them suddenly one morning that they may join\ntheir regiment forthwith.  Bidding good-bye therefore, gladly,\nhastily, they set out with as little delay as possible for Flanders;\nand passing the old school by their nearest road thither, stay for an\nhour, find an excuse for coming into the hall in uniform, with which\nit must be confessed they seem thoroughly satisfied–Uthwart quite\nperversely at ease in the stiff make of his scarlet jacket with black\nfacings–and so pass onward on their way to Dover, Dunkirk, they\nscarcely know whither finally, among the featureless villages, the\nlong monotonous lines of the windmills, the poplars, blurred with\ncold fogs, but marking the [230] roads through the snow which covers\nthe endless plain, till they come in sight at last of the army in\nmotion, like machines moving–how little it looked on that endless\nplain!–pass on their rapid way to fame, to unpurchased promotion, as\na matter of course to responsibility also, till, their fortune\nturning upon them, they miscarry in the latter fatally.  They joined\nin fact a distinguished regiment in a gallant army, immediately after\na victory in those Flemish regions; shared its encouragement as fully\nas if they had had a share in its perils; the high character of the\nyoung officers consolidating itself easily, pleasantly for them, till\nthe hour of an act of thoughtless bravery, almost the sole irregular\nor undisciplined act of Uthwart’s life, he still following his\nsenior–criminal however to the military conscience, under the actual\ncircumstances, and in an enemy’s country.  The faulty thing was done,\ncertainly, with a scrupulous, a characteristic completeness on their\npart; and with their prize actually in hand, an old weather-beaten\nflag such as hung in the cathedral aisle at school, they bethought\nthem for the first time of its price, with misgivings now in rapid\ngrowth, as they return to their posts as nearly as may be, for the\ndivision has been ordered forward in their brief absence, to find\nthemselves under arrest, with that damning proof of heroism, of\nguilt, in their possession, relinquished however along with the\nswords they will never handle [231] again–toys, idolised toys of our\nlater youth, we weep at the thought of them as never to be handled\nagain!–as they enter the prison to await summary trial next day on\nthe charge of wantonly deserting their posts while in position of\nhigh trust in time of war.",
        "The full details of what had happened could have been told only by\none or other of themselves; by Uthwart best, in the somewhat matter-\nof-fact and prosaic journal he had managed to keep from the first,\nnoting there the incidents of each successive day, as if in\nanticipation of its possible service by way of piece justificative,\nshould such become necessary, attesting hour by hour their single-\nhearted devotion to soldierly duty.  Had a draughtsman equally\ntruthful or equally “realistic,” as we say, accompanied them and made\na like use of his pencil, he might have been mistaken at home for an\nartist aiming at “effect,” by skilful “arrangements” to tickle\npeople’s interest in the spectacle of war–the sudden ruin of a\nvillage street, the heap of bleeding horses in the half-ploughed\nfield, the gaping bridges, hand or face of the dead peeping from a\nhastily made grave at the roadside, smoke-stained rents in cottage-\nwalls, ignoble ruin everywhere–ignoble but for its frank expression.",
        "But you find in Uthwart’s journal, side by side with those ugly\npatches, very precise and unadorned records of their common\ngallantry, the more effective indeed for their simplicity; [232] and\nnot of gallantry only, but of the long-sustained patience also, the\nessential monotony of military life, even on a campaign.  Peril,\ngood-luck, promotion, the grotesque hardships which leave them smart\nas ever, (as if, so others observe, dust and mire wouldn’t hold on\nthem, so “spick and span” they were, more especially on days of any\nexceptional risk or effort) the great confidence reposed in them at\nlast; all is noted, till, with a little quiet pride, he records a\ngun-shot wound which keeps him a month alone in hospital wearily; and\nat last, its hasty but seemingly complete healing.",
        "Following, leading, resting sometimes perforce, amid gun-shots,\nputrefying wounds, green corpses, they never lacked good spirits, any\nmore than the birds warbling perennially afresh, as they will, over\nsuch gangrened places, or the grass which so soon covers them.  And\nat length fortune, their misfortune, perversely determined that\nheroism should take the form of patience under the walls of an\nunimportant frontier town, with old Vauban fortifications seemingly\nmade only for appearance’ sake, like the work in the trenches–\ngardener’s work! round about the walls they are called upon to\nsuperintend day after day.  It was like a calm at sea, delaying one’s\npassage, one’s purpose in being on board at all, a dead calm, yet\nwith an awful feeling of tension, intolerable at last for those who\nwere still all athirst for action.  How dumb and [233] stupid the\nplace seemed, in its useless defiance of conquerors, anxious, for\nreasons not indeed apparent, but which they were undoubtedly within\ntheir rights in holding to, not to blow it at once into the air–the\nsteeple, the perky weathercock–to James Stokes in particular, always\neloquent in action, longing for heroic effort, and ready to pay its\nprice, maddened now by the palpable imposture in front of him morning\nafter morning, as he demonstrates conclusively to Uthwart, seduced at\nlast from the clearer sense of duty and discipline, not by the\ndemonstrated ease, but rather by the apparent difficulty of what\nStokes proposes to do.  They might have been deterred by recent\nexample.  Colonel –, who, as every one knew, had actually gained a\nvictory by disobeying orders, had not been suffered to remain in the\narmy of which he was an ornament.  It was easy in fact for both,\nthough it seemed the heroic thing, to dash through the calm with\ndelightful sense of active powers renewed; to pass into the\nbeleaguered town with a handful of men, and no loss, after a manner\nthe feasibility of which Stokes had explained acutely but in vain at\nheadquarters.  He proved it to Uthwart at all events, and a few\nothers.  Delightful heroism! delightful self-indulgence!  It was\ndelayed for a moment by orders to move forward at last, with hopes\nchecked almost immediately after by a countermand, bringing them\nright round their [234] stupid dumb enemy to the same wearisome\nposition once again, to the trenches and the rest, but with their\nthirst for action only stimulated the more.  How great the\ndisappointment! encouraging a certain laxity of discipline that had\nprevailed about them of late.  They take advantage however of a vague\nphrase in their instructions; determine in haste to proceed on their\nplan as carefully, as sparingly of the lives of others as may be;\ndetach a small company, hazarding thereby an algebraically certain\nscheme at headquarters of victory or secure retreat, which embraced\nthe entire country in its calculations; detach themselves; finally\npass into the place, and out again with their prize, themselves\nsecure.  Themselves only could have told the details–the intensely\npleasant, the glorious sense of movement renewed once more; of\ndefiance, just for once, of a seemingly stupid control; their dismay\nat finding their company led forward by others, their own posts\ndeserted, their handful of men–nowhere!",
        "In an ordinary trial at law, the motives, every detail of so\nirregular an act might have been weighed, changing the colour of it.\nTheir general character would have told in their favour, but actually\ntold against them now; they had but won an exceptional trust to\nbetray it.  Martial courts exist not for consideration, but for vivid\nexemplary effect and prompt punishment.  “There is a kind of tribunal\nincidental [235] to service in the field,” writes another diarist,\nwho may tell in his own words what remains to be told.  “This court,\"\nhe says, “may consist of three staff-officers only, but has the power\nof sentencing to death.  On the –st two young officers of the –th\nregiment, in whom it appears unusual confidence had been placed, were\nbrought before this court, on the charge of desertion and wantonly\nexposing their company to danger.  They were found guilty, and the\nproper penalty death, to be inflicted next morning before the\nregiment marches.  The delinquents were understood to have appealed\nto a general court-martial; desperately at last, to ’the judgment of\ntheir country’; but were held to have no locus standi whatever for an\nappeal under the actual circumstances.  As a civilian I cannot but\ndoubt the justice, whatever may be thought of the expediency, of such\na summary process in regard to the capital penalty.  The regiment to\nwhich the culprits belonged, with some others, was quartered for the\nnight in the faubourg of Saint –, recently under blockade by a\nportion of our forces.  I was awoke at daybreak by the sound of\nmarching.  The morning was a particularly clear one, though, as the\nsun was not yet risen, it looked grey and sad along the empty street,\nup which a party of grey soldiers were passing with steady pace.  I\nknew for what purpose.",
        "“The whole of the force in garrison here [236] had already marched to\nthe place of execution, the immense courtyard of a monastery,\nsurrounded irregularly by ancient buildings like those of some\ncathedral precincts I have seen in England.  Here the soldiers then\nformed three sides of a great square, a grave having been dug on the\nfourth side.  Shortly afterwards the funeral procession came up.\nFirst came the band of the –th, playing the Dead March; next the\nfiring party, consisting of twelve non-commissioned officers; then\nthe coffins, followed immediately by the unfortunate prisoners,\naccompanied by a chaplain.  Slowly and sadly did the mournful\nprocession approach, when it passed through three sides of the\nsquare, the troops having been previously faced inwards, and then\nhalted opposite to the grave.  The proceedings of the court-martial\nwere then read; and the elder prisoner having been blindfolded was\nordered to kneel down on his coffin, which had been placed close to\nthe grave, the firing party taking up a position exactly opposite at\na few yards’ distance.  The poor fellow’s face was deadly pale, but\nhe had marched his last march as steadily as ever I saw a man step,\nand bore himself throughout most bravely, though an oddly mixed\nexpression passed over his countenance when he was directed to remove\nhimself from the side of his companion, shaking his hand first.  At\nthis moment there was hardly a dry eye, and several young soldiers\nfainted, numberless as must be [237] the scenes of horror which even\nthey have witnessed during these last months.  At length the\nchaplain, who had remained praying with the prisoner, quietly\nwithdrew, and at a given signal, but without word of command, the\nmuskets were levelled, a volley was fired, and the body of the\nunfortunate man sprang up, falling again on his back.  One shot had\npurposely been reserved; and as the presiding officer thought he was\nnot quite dead a musket was placed close to his head and fired.  All\nwas now over; but the troops having been formed into columns were\nmarched close by the body as it lay on the ground, after which it was\nplaced in one of the coffins and buried.",
        "“I had almost forgotten his companion, the younger and more fortunate\nprisoner, though I could scarcely tell, as I looked at him, whether\nhis fate was really preferable in leaving his own rough coffin\nunoccupied behind him there.  Lieutenant (I think Edward) Uthwart, as\nbeing the younger of the two offenders, ’by the mercy of the court’\nhad his sentence commuted to dismissal from the army with disgrace.\nA colour-sergeant then advanced with the former officer’s sword, a\nremarkably fine one, which he thereupon snapped in sunder over the\nprisoner’s head as he knelt.  After this the prisoner’s regimental\ncoat was handed forward and put upon him, the epaulettes and buttons\nbeing then torn off and flung to a distance.  This part of [238] such\nsentences is almost invariably spared; but, I suppose through\nunavoidable haste, was on the present occasion somewhat rudely\ncarried out.  I shall never forget the expression of this man’s\ncountenance, though I have seen many sad things in the course of my\nprofession.  He had the sort of good looks which always rivet\nattention, and in most minds friendly interest; and now, amid all his\npain and bewilderment, bore a look of humility and submission as he\nunderwent those extraordinary details of his punishment, which\ntouched me very oddly with a sort of desire (I cannot otherwise\nexpress it) to share his lot, to be actually in his place for a\nmoment.  Yet, alas! –no! say rather Thank Heaven! the nearest\napproach to that look I have seen has been on the face of those whom\nI have known from circumstances to be almost incapable at the time of\nany feeling whatever.  I would have offered him pecuniary aid,\nsupposing he needed it, but it was impossible.  I went on with the\nregiment, leaving the poor wretch to shift for himself, Heaven knows\nhow, the state of the country being what it is.  He might join the\nenemy!”",
        "What money Uthwart had about him had in fact passed that morning into\nthe hands of his guards.  To tell what followed would be to accompany\nhim on a roundabout and really aimless journey, the details of which\nhe could never afterwards recall.  See him lingering for morsels\n[239] of food at some shattered farmstead, or assisted by others\nalmost as wretched as himself, sometimes without his asking.  In his\nworn military dress he seems a part of the ruin under which he creeps\nfor a night’s rest as darkness comes on.  He actually came round\nagain to the scene of his disgrace, of the execution; looked in vain\nfor the precise spot where he had knelt; then, almost envying him who\nlay there, for the unmarked grave; passed over it perhaps\nunrecognised for some change in that terrible place, or rather in\nhimself; wept then as never before in his life; dragged himself on\nonce more, till suddenly the whole country seems to move under the\nrumour, the very thunder, of “the crowning victory,” as he is made to\nunderstand.  Falling in with the tide of its heroes returning to\nEnglish shores, his vagrant footsteps are at last directed homewards.\nHe finds himself one afternoon at the gate, turning out of the quiet\nSussex road, through the fields for whose safety he had fought with\nso much of undeniable gallantry and approval.",
        "On that July afternoon the gardens, the woods, mounted in flawless\nsweetness all round him as he stood, to meet the circle of a flawless\nsky.  Not a cloud; not a motion on the grass!  At the first he had\nintended to return home no more; and it had been a proof of his great\ndejection that he sent at last, as best he could, for money.  They\nknew his fate already [240] by report, and were touched naturally\nwhen that had followed on the record of his honours.  Had it been\npossible they would have set forth at any risk to meet, to seek him;\nwere waiting now for the weary one to come to the gate, ready with\ntheir oil and wine, to speak metaphorically, and from this time forth\nunderwent his charm to the utmost–the charm of an exquisite\ncharacter, felt in some way to be inseparable from his person, his\ncharacteristic movements, touched also now with seemingly irreparable\nsorrow.  For his part, drinking in here the last sweets of the\nsensible world, it was as if he, the lover of roses, had never before\nbeen aware of them at all.  The original softness of his temperament,\nagainst which the sense of greater things thrust upon him had\nsuccessfully reacted, asserted itself again now as he lay at ease,\nthe ease well merited by his deeds, his sorrows.  That he was going\nto die moved those about him to humour this mood, to soften all\nthings to his touch; and looking back he might have pronounced those\nfour last years of doom the happiest of his life.  The memory of the\ngrave into which he had gazed so steadily on the execution morning,\ninto which, as he feels, one half of himself had then descended, does\nnot lessen his shrinking from the fate before him, yet fortifies him\nto face it manfully, gives a sort of fraternal familiarity to death;\nin a few weeks’ time this battle too is fought out; it is as if the\nthing were ended. [241] The delightful summer heat, the freshness it\nenhances–he contrasts such things no longer with the sort of place\nto which he is hastening.  The possible duration of life for him was\nindeed uncertain, the future to some degree indefinite; but as\nregarded any fairly distant date, anything like a term of years, from\nthe first there had been no doubt at all; he would be no longer here.\nMeantime it was like a delightful few days’ additional holiday from\nschool, with which perforce one must be content at last; or as though\nhe had not been pardoned on that terrible morning, but only reprieved\nfor two or three years.  Yet how large a proportion they would have\nseemed in the whole sum of his years.  He would have liked to lie\nfinally in the garden among departed pets, dear dead dogs and horses;\nfaintly proposes it one day; but after a while comprehends the\nchurchyard, with its white spots in the distant flowery view, as\nfilling harmoniously its own proper place there.  The weary soul\nseemed to be settling deeper into the body and the earth it came of,\ninto the condition of the flowers, the grass, proper creatures of the\nearth to which he is returning.  The saintly vicar visits him\nconsiderately; is repelled with politeness; goes on his way pondering\ninwardly what kind of place there might be, in any possible scheme of\nanother world, for so absolutely unspiritual a subject.  In fact, as\nthe breath of the infinite world came about him, he clung all [242]\nthe faster to the beloved finite things still in contact with him; he\nhad successfully hidden from his eyes all beside.",
        "His reprieve however lasted long enough, after all, for a certain\nchange of opinion of immense weight to him–a revision or reversal of\njudgment.  It came about in this way.  When peace was arranged, with\nquestion of rewards, pensions, and the like, certain battles or\nincidents therein were fought over again, sometimes in the highest\nplaces of debate.  On such an occasion a certain speaker cites the\ncase of Lieutenant James Stokes and another, as being “pessimi\nexempli”: whereupon a second speaker gets up, prepared with full\ndetail, insists, brings that incidental matter to the front for an\nhour, tells his unfortunate friend’s story so effectively,\npathetically, that, as happens with our countrymen, they repent.  The\nmatter gets into the newspapers, and, coming thus into sympathetic\npublic view, something like glory wins from Emerald Uthwart his last\ntouch of animation.  Just not too late he received the offer of a\ncommission; kept the letter there open within sight.  Aldy, who\n“never shed tears and was incapable of pain,” in his great physical\nweakness, wept–shall we say for the second time in his life?  A less\nexcitement would have been more favorable to any chance there might\nbe of the patient’s surviving.  In fact the old gun-shot wound,\nwrongly thought to be cured, which had caused [243] the one illness\nof his life, is now drawing out what remains of it, as he feels with\na kind of odd satisfaction and pride–his old glorious wound!  And\nthen, as of old, an absolute submissiveness comes over him, as he\ngazes round at the place, the relics of his uniform, the letter lying\nthere.  It was as if there was nothing more that could be said.\nAccounts thus settled, he stretched himself in the bed he had\noccupied as a boy, more completely at his ease than since the day\nwhen he had left home for the first time.  Respited from death once,\nhe was twice believed to be dead before the date actually registered\non his tomb.  “What will it matter a hundred years hence?” they used\nto ask by way of simple comfort in boyish troubles at school,\noverwhelming at the moment.  Was that in truth part of a certain\nrevelation of the inmost truth of things to “babes,” such as we have\nheard of?  What did it matter–the gifts, the good-fortune, its\nterrible withdrawal, the long agony?  Emerald Uthwart would have been\nall but a centenarian to-day.",
        "Postscript, from the Diary of a Surgeon,\nAugust –th, 18–.",
        "I was summoned by letter into the country to perform an operation on\nthe dead body of a young man, formerly an officer in the army.  The\ncause of death is held to have been some [244] kind of distress of\nmind, concurrent with the effects of an old gun-shot wound, the ball\nstill remaining somewhere in the body.  My instructions were to\nremove this, at the express desire, as I understood, of the deceased,\nrather than to ascertain the precise cause of death.  This however\nbecame apparent in the course of my search for the ball, which had\nenveloped itself in the muscular substance in the region of the\nheart, and was removed with difficulty.  I have known cases of this\nkind, where anxiety has caused incurable cardiac derangement (the\ndeceased seems to have been actually sentenced to death for some\nmilitary offence when on service in Flanders), and such mental strain\nwould of course have been aggravated by the presence of a foreign\nobject in that place.  On arriving at my destination, a small village\nin a remote part of Sussex, I proceeded through the little orderly\nchurchyard, where however the monthly roses were blooming all their\nown way among the formal white marble monuments of the wealthier\npeople of the neighbourhood.  At one of these the masons were at\nwork, picking and chipping in the otherwise absolute stillness of the\nsummer afternoon.  They were in fact opening the family burial-place\nof the people who summoned me hither; and the workmen pointed out\ntheir abode, conspicuous on the slope beyond, towards which I bent my\nsteps accordingly.  I was conducted to a large upper [245] room or\nattic, set freely open to sun and air, and found the body lying in a\ncoffin, almost hidden under very rich-scented cut flowers, after a\nmanner I have never seen in this country, except in the case of one\nor two Catholics laid out for burial.  The mother of the deceased was\npresent, and actually assisted my operations, amid such tokens of\ndistress, though perfectly self-controlled, as I fervently hope I may\nnever witness again.",
        "Deceased was in his twenty-seventh year, but looked many years\nyounger; had indeed scarcely yet reached the full condition of\nmanhood.  The extreme purity of the outlines, both of the face and\nlimbs, was such as is usually found only in quite early youth; the\nbrow especially, under an abundance of fair hair, finely formed, not\nhigh, but arched and full, as is said to be the way with those\nwho have the imaginative temper in excess.  Sad to think that had he\nlived reason must have deserted that so worthy abode of it!  I was\nstruck by the great beauty of the organic developments, in the\nstrictly anatomic sense; those of the throat and diaphragm in\nparticular might have been modelled for a teacher of normal\nphysiology, or a professor of design.  The flesh was still almost as\nfirm as that of a living person; as happens when, as in this case,\ndeath comes to all intents and purposes as gradually as in old age.",
        "This expression of health and life, under my seemingly merciless\ndoings, together with the mother’s distress, touched me to a degree\nvery [246] unusual, I conceive, in persons of my years and\nprofession.  Though I believed myself to be acting by his express\nwish, I felt like a criminal.  The ball, a small one, much corroded\nwith blood, was at length removed; and I was then directed to wrap it\nin a partly-printed letter, or other document, and place it in the\nbreast-pocket of a faded and much-worn scarlet soldier’s coat, put\nover the shirt which enveloped the body.  The flowers were then\nhastily replaced, the hands and the peak of the handsome nose\nremaining visible among them; the wind ruffled the fair hair a\nlittle; the lips were still red.  I shall not forget it.  The lid was\nthen placed on the coffin and screwed down in my presence.  There was\nno plate or other inscription upon it.",
