        "Once upon a time, there was a mighty baron in the North Countrie who\nwas a great magician that knew everything that would come to pass. So\none day, when his little boy was four years old, he looked into the\nBook of Fate to see what would happen to him. And to his dismay, he\nfound that his son would wed a lowly maid that had just been born in a\nhouse under the shadow of York Minster. Now the Baron knew the father\nof the little girl was very, very poor, and he had five children\nalready. So he called for his horse, and rode into York; and passed by\nthe father’s house, and saw him sitting by the door, sad and doleful.\nSo he dismounted and went up to him and said: “What is the matter, my\ngood man?” And the man said: “Well, your honour, the fact is, I’ve\nfive children already, and now a sixth’s come, a little lass, and\nwhere to get the bread from to fill their mouths, that’s more than I\ncan say.”",
        "“Don’t be downhearted, my man,” said the Baron. “If that’s your\ntrouble, I can help you. I’ll take away the last little one, and you\nwont have to bother about her.”",
        "“Thank you kindly, sir,” said the man; and he went in and brought out\nthe lass and gave her to the Baron, who mounted his horse and rode\naway with her. And when he got by the bank of the river Ouse, he threw\nthe little, thing into the river, and rode off to his castle.",
        "But the little lass didn’t sink; her clothes kept her up for a time,\nand she floated, and she floated, till she was cast ashore just in\nfront of a fisherman’s hut. There the fisherman found her, and took\npity on the poor little thing and took her into his house, and she\nlived there till she was fifteen years old, and a fine handsome girl.",
        "One day it happened that the Baron went out hunting with some\ncompanions along the banks of the River Ouse, and stopped at the\nfisherman’s hut to get a drink, and the girl came out to give it to\nthem. They all noticed her beauty, and one of them said to the Baron:\n“You can read fates, Baron, whom will she marry, d’ye think?”",
        "“Oh! that’s easy to guess,” said the Baron; “some yokel or other. But\nI’ll cast her horoscope. Come here girl, and tell me on what day you\nwere born?”",
        "“I don’t know, sir,” said the girl, “I was picked up just here after\nhaving been brought down by the river about fifteen years ago.”",
        "Then the Baron knew who she was, and when they went away, he rode back\nand said to the girl: “Hark ye, girl, I will make your fortune. Take\nthis letter to my brother in Scarborough, and you will be settled for\nlife.” And the girl took the letter and said she would go. Now this\nwas what he had written in the letter:",
        "“Dear Brother,–Take the bearer and put her to death immediately.",
        "“Yours affectionately,",
        "“Albert.”",
        "So soon after the girl set out for Scarborough, and slept for the\nnight at a little inn. Now that very night a band of robbers broke\ninto the inn, and searched the girl, who had no money, and only the\nletter. So they opened this and read it, and thought it a shame. The\ncaptain of the robbers took a pen and paper and wrote this letter:",
        "“Dear Brother,–Take the bearer and marry her to my son immediately.",
        "“Yours affectionately,",
        "“Albert.”",
        "And then he gave it to the girl, bidding her begone. So she went on to\nthe Baron’s brother at Scarborough, a noble knight, with whom the\nBaron’s son was staying. When she gave the letter to his brother, he\ngave orders for the wedding to be prepared at once, and they were\nmarried that very day.",
        "Soon after, the Baron himself came to his brother’s castle, and what\nwas his surprise to find that the very thing he had plotted against\nhad come to pass. But he was not to be put off that way; and he took\nout the girl for a walk, as he said, along the cliffs. And when he got\nher all alone, he took her by the arms, and was going to throw her\nover. But she begged hard for her life. “I have not done anything,\"\nshe said: “if you will only spare me, I will do whatever you wish. I\nwill never see you or your son again till you desire it.” Then the\nBaron took off his gold ring and threw it into the sea, saying: “Never\nlet me see your face till you can show me that ring;” and he let her\ngo.",
        "The poor girl wandered on and on, till at last she came to a great\nnoble’s castle, and she asked to have some work given to her; and they\nmade her the scullion girl of the castle, for she had been used to\nsuch work in the fisherman’s hut.",
        "Now one day, who should she see coming up to the noble’s house but the\nBaron and his brother and his son, her husband. She didn’t know what\nto do; but thought they would not see her in the castle kitchen. So\nshe went back to her work with a sigh, and set to cleaning a huge big\nfish that was to be boiled for their dinner. And, as she was cleaning\nit, she saw something shine inside it, and what do you think she\nfound? Why, there was the Baron’s ring, the very one he had thrown\nover the cliff at Scarborough. She was right glad to see it, you may\nbe sure. Then she cooked the fish as nicely as she could, and served\nit up.",
        "Well, when the fish came on the table, the guests liked it so well\nthat they asked the noble who cooked it. He said he didn’t know, but\ncalled to his servants: “Ho, there, send up the cook that cooked that\nfine fish.” So they went down to the kitchen and told the girl she was\nwanted in the hall. Then she washed and tidied herself and put the\nBaron’s gold ring on her thumb and went up into the hall.",
        "When the banqueters saw such a young and beautiful cook they were\nsurprised. But the Baron was in a tower of a temper, and started up as\nif he would do her some violence. So the girl went up to him with her\nhand before her with the ring on it; and she put it down before him on\nthe table. Then at last the Baron saw that no one could fight against\nFate, and he handed her to a seat and announced to all the company\nthat this was his son’s true wife; and he took her and his son home to\nhis castle; and they all lived as happy as could be ever afterwards.",
