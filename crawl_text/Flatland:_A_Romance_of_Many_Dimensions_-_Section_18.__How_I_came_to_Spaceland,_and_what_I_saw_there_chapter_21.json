        "\n\n",
        "\nAn unspeakable horror seized me.  There was a darkness;\nthen a dizzy, sickening sensation of sight that was not like seeing;\nI saw a Line that was no Line; Space that was not Space:\nI was myself, and not myself.  When I could find voice,\nI shrieked aloud in agony, “Either this is madness or it is Hell.\"\n“It is neither,” calmly replied the voice of the Sphere,\n“it is Knowledge; it is Three Dimensions:  open your eye once again\nand try to look steadily.”",
        "I looked, and, behold, a new world!  There stood before me,\nvisibly incorporate, all that I had before inferred, conjectured,\ndreamed, of perfect Circular beauty.  What seemed the centre\nof the Stranger’s form lay open to my view:  yet I could see no heart,\nnor lungs, nor arteries, only a beautiful harmonious Something —\nfor which I had no words; but you, my Readers in Spaceland,\nwould call it the surface of the Sphere.",
        "Prostrating myself mentally before my Guide, I cried, “How is it,\nO divine ideal of consummate loveliness and wisdom that I see\nthy inside, and yet cannot discern thy heart, thy lungs, thy arteries,\nthy liver?”  “What you think you see, you see not,” he replied;\n“it is not given to you, nor to any other Being to behold\nmy internal parts.  I am of a different order of Beings from those\nin Flatland.  Were I a Circle, you could discern my intestines,\nbut I am a Being, composed as I told you before, of many Circles,\nthe Many in the One, called in this country a Sphere.  And,\njust as the outside of a Cube is a Square, so the outside of a Sphere\npresents the appearance of a Circle.”",
        "Bewildered though I was by my Teacher’s enigmatic utterance,\nI no longer chafed against it, but worshipped him in silent adoration.\nHe continued, with more mildness in his voice.  “Distress not yourself\nif you cannot at first understand the deeper mysteries of Spaceland.\nBy degrees they will dawn upon you.  Let us begin by casting back\na glance at the region whence you came.  Return with me a while\nto the plains of Flatland, and I will shew you that which\nyou have often reasoned and thought about, but never seen\nwith the sense of sight — a visible angle.”  “Impossible!” I cried;\nbut, the Sphere leading the way, I followed as if in a dream,\ntill once more his voice arrested me:  “Look yonder,\nand behold your own Pentagonal house, and all its inmates.”",
        "I looked below, and saw with my physical eye all that\ndomestic individuality which I had hitherto merely inferred\nwith the understanding.  And how poor and shadowy was the inferred\nconjecture in comparison with the reality which I now beheld!\nMy four Sons calmly asleep in the North-Western rooms,\nmy two orphan Grandsons to the South; the Servants, the Butler,\nmy Daughter, all in their several apartments.  Only my\naffectionate Wife, alarmed by my continued absence, had quitted\nher room and was roving up and down in the Hall, anxiously awaiting\nmy return.  Also the Page, aroused by my cries, had left his room,\nand under pretext of ascertaining whether I had fallen\nsomewhere in a faint, was prying into the cabinet in my study.\nAll this I could now SEE, not merely infer; and as we came\nnearer and nearer, I could discern even the contents of my cabinet,\nand the two chests of gold, and the tablets of which the Sphere\nhad made mention.",
        "Illustration 9",
        "Touched by my Wife’s distress, I would have sprung downward\nto reassure her, but I found myself incapable of motion.\n“Trouble not yourself about your Wife,” said my Guide:\n“she will not be long left in anxiety; meantime, let us take\na survey of Flatland.”",
        "Once more I felt myself rising through space.  It was even as\nthe Sphere had said.  The further we receded from the object\nwe beheld, the larger became the field of vision.  My native city,\nwith the interior of every house and every creature therein,\nlay open to my view in miniature.  We mounted higher, and lo,\nthe secrets of the earth, the depths of mines and inmost caverns\nof the hills, were bared before me.",
        "Awestruck at the sight of the mysteries of the earth,\nthus unveiled before my unworthy eye, I said to my Companion,\n“Behold, I am become as a God.  For the wise men in our country say\nthat to see all things, or as they express it, OMNIVIDENCE,\nis the attribute of God alone.”  There was something of scorn\nin the voice of my Teacher as he made answer:  “Is it so indeed?\nThen the very pick-pockets and cut-throats of my country\nare to be worshipped by your wise men as being Gods:\nfor there is not one of them that does not see as much as you see now.\nBut trust me, your wise men are wrong.”",
        "I.  Then is omnividence the attribute of others besides Gods?",
        "SPHERE.  I do not know.  But, if a pick-pocket or a cut-throat\nof our country can see everything that is in your country,\nsurely that is no reason why the pick-pocket or cut-throat should be\naccepted by you as a God.  This omnividence, as you call it —\nit is not a common word in Spaceland — does it make you more just,\nmore merciful, less selfish, more loving?  Not in the least.\nThen how does it make you more divine?",
        "I.  “More merciful, more loving!”  But these are the qualities\nof women!  And we know that a Circle is a higher Being\nthan a Straight Line, in so far as knowledge and wisdom\nare more to be esteemed than mere affection.",
        "SPHERE.  It is not for me to classify human faculties according\nto merit.  Yet many of the best and wisest in Spaceland think more\nof the affections than of the understanding, more of your despised\nStraight Lines than of your belauded Circles.  But enough of this.\nLook yonder.  Do you know that building?",
        "I looked, and afar off I saw an immense Polygonal structure, in which\nI recognized the General Assembly Hall of the States of Flatland,\nsurrounded by dense lines of Pentagonal buildings at right angles\nto each other, which I knew to be streets; and I perceived that\nI was approaching the great Metropolis.",
        "“Here we descend,” said my Guide.  It was now morning,\nthe first hour of the first day of the two thousandth year of our era.\nActing, as was their wont, in strict accordance with precedent,\nthe highest Circles of the realm were meeting in solemn conclave,\nas they had met on the first hour of the first day of the year 1000,\nand also on the first hour of the first day of the year 0.",
        "The minutes of the previous meetings were now read by one whom I\nat once recognized as my brother, a perfectly Symmetrical Square,\nand the Chief Clerk of the High Council.  It was found recorded\non each occasion that:  “Whereas the States had been troubled\nby divers ill-intentioned persons pretending to have received\nrevelations from another World, and professing to produce\ndemonstrations whereby they had instigated to frenzy both themselves\nand others, it had been for this cause unanimously resolved\nby the Grand Council that on the first day of each millenary,\nspecial injunctions be sent to the Prefects in the several districts\nof Flatland, to make strict search for such misguided persons,\nand without formality of mathematical examination, to destroy all such\nas were Isosceles of any degree, to scourge and imprison\nany regular Triangle, to cause any Square or Pentagon to be sent\nto the district Asylum, and to arrest any one of higher rank,\nsending him straightway to the Capital to be examined and judged\nby the Council.”",
        "“You hear your fate,” said the Sphere to me, while the Council\nwas passing for the third time the formal resolution.\n“Death or imprisonment awaits the Apostle of the Gospel\nof Three Dimensions.”  “Not so,” replied I, “the matter is now\nso clear to me, the nature of real space so palpable, that methinks\nI could make a child understand it.  Permit me but to descend\nat this moment and enlighten them.”  “Not yet,” said my Guide,\n“the time will come for that.  Meantime I must perform my mission.\nStay thou there in thy place.”  Saying these words,\nhe leaped with great dexterity into the sea (if I may so call it)\nof Flatland, right in the midst of the ring of Counsellors.  “I come,\"\ncried he, “to proclaim that there is a land of Three Dimensions.”",
        "I could see many of the younger Counsellors start back\nin manifest horror, as the Sphere’s circular section widened\nbefore them.  But on a sign from the presiding Circle\n— who shewed not the slightest alarm or surprise — six Isosceles\nof a low type from six different quarters rushed upon the Sphere.\n“We have him,” they cried; “No; yes; we have him still! he’s going!\nhe’s gone!”",
        "“My Lords,” said the President to the Junior Circles of the Council,\n“there is not the slightest need for surprise; the secret archives,\nto which I alone have access, tell me that a similar occurrence\nhappened on the last two millennial commencements.  You will,\nof course, say nothing of these trifles outside the Cabinet.”",
        "Raising his voice, he now summoned the guards.  “Arrest the policemen;\ngag them.  You know your duty.”  After he had consigned to their fate\nthe wretched policemen — ill-fated and unwilling witnesses\nof a State-secret which they were not to be permitted to reveal —\nhe again addressed the Counsellors.  “My Lords, the business\nof the Council being concluded, I have only to wish you\na happy New Year.”  Before departing, he expressed, at some length,\nto the Clerk, my excellent but most unfortunate brother,\nhis sincere regret that, in accordance with precedent and for the sake\nof secrecy, he must condemn him to perpetual imprisonment,\nbut added his satisfaction that, unless some mention were made by him\nof that day’s incident, his life would be spared.",
        "",
        "Section 19.  How, though the Sphere shewed me other mysteries\n               of Spaceland, I still desired more; and what came of it",
        "\nWhen I saw my poor brother led away to imprisonment, I attempted\nto leap down into the Council Chamber, desiring to intercede\non his behalf, or at least bid him farewell.  But I found that\nI had no motion of my own.  I absolutely depended on the volition\nof my Guide, who said in gloomy tones, “Heed not thy brother;\nhaply thou shalt have ample time hereafter to condole with him.\nFollow me.”",
        "Illustration 10",
        "Once more we ascended into space.  “Hitherto,” said the Sphere,\n“I have shewn you naught save Plane Figures and their interiors.\nNow I must introduce you to Solids, and reveal to you the plan\nupon which they are constructed.  Behold this multitude\nof moveable square cards.  See, I put one on another, not,\nas you supposed, Northward of the other, but ON the other.\nNow a second, now a third.  See, I am building up a Solid\nby a multitude of Squares parallel to one another.  Now the Solid\nis complete, being as high as it is long and broad,\nand we call it a Cube.”",
        "“Pardon me, my Lord,” replied I; “but to my eye the appearance is as\nof an Irregular Figure whose inside is laid open to the view;\nin other words, methinks I see no Solid, but a Plane such as\nwe infer in Flatland; only of an Irregularity which betokens\nsome monstrous criminal, so that the very sight of it is painful\nto my eyes.”",
        "“True,” said the Sphere, “it appears to you a Plane,\nbecause you are not accustomed to light and shade and perspective;\njust as in Flatland a Hexagon would appear a Straight Line to one\nwho has not the Art of Sight Recognition.  But in reality\nit is a Solid, as you shall learn by the sense of Feeling.”",
        "He then introduced me to the Cube, and I found that this\nmarvellous Being was indeed no Plane, but a Solid; and that he was\nendowed with six plane sides and eight terminal points\ncalled solid angles; and I remembered the saying of the Sphere\nthat just such a Creature as this would be formed by a Square moving,\nin Space, parallel to himself:  and I rejoiced to think\nthat so insignificant a Creature as I could in some sense be called\nthe Progenitor of so illustrious an offspring.",
        "But still I could not fully understand the meaning of what my Teacher\nhad told me concerning “light” and “shade” and “perspective\";\nand I did not hesitate to put my difficulties before him.",
        "Were I to give the Sphere’s explanation of these matters,\nsuccinct and clear though it was, it would be tedious to an inhabitant\nof Space, who knows these things already.  Suffice it, that by his\nlucid statements, and by changing the position of objects and lights,\nand by allowing me to feel the several objects and even his own\nsacred Person, he at last made all things clear to me,\nso that I could now readily distinguish between a Circle and a Sphere,\na Plane Figure and a Solid.",
        "This was the Climax, the Paradise, of my strange eventful History.\nHenceforth I have to relate the story of my miserable Fall: —\nmost miserable, yet surely most undeserved!  For why should the thirst\nfor knowledge be aroused, only to be disappointed and punished?\nMy volition shrinks from the painful task of recalling my humiliation;\nyet, like a second Prometheus, I will endure this and worse,\nif by any means I may arouse in the interiors of Plane and Solid\nHumanity a spirit of rebellion against the Conceit which would limit\nour Dimensions to Two or Three or any number short of Infinity.\nAway then with all personal considerations!  Let me continue\nto the end, as I began, without further digressions or anticipations,\npursuing the plain path of dispassionate History.  The exact facts,\nthe exact words, — and they are burnt in upon my brain, —\nshall be set down without alteration of an iota; and let my Readers\njudge between me and Destiny.",
        "The Sphere would willingly have continued his lessons\nby indoctrinating me in the conformation of all regular Solids,\nCylinders, Cones, Pyramids, Pentahedrons, Hexahedrons, Dodecahedrons,\nand Spheres:  but I ventured to interrupt him.  Not that I was\nwearied of knowledge.  On the contrary, I thirsted for yet deeper\nand fuller draughts than he was offering to me.",
        "“Pardon me,” said I, “O Thou Whom I must no longer address\nas the Perfection of all Beauty; but let me beg thee to vouchsafe\nthy servant a sight of thine interior.”",
        "SPHERE.  My what?",
        "I.  Thine interior:  thy stomach, thy intestines.",
        "SPHERE.  Whence this ill-timed impertinent request?  And what\nmean you by saying that I am no longer the Perfection of all Beauty?",
        "I.  My Lord, your own wisdom has taught me to aspire to One\neven more great, more beautiful, and more closely approximate\nto Perfection than yourself.  As you yourself, superior to all\nFlatland forms, combine many Circles in One, so doubtless there is One\nabove you who combines many Spheres in One Supreme Existence,\nsurpassing even the Solids of Spaceland.  And even as we,\nwho are now in Space, look down on Flatland and see the insides\nof all things, so of a certainty there is yet above us some higher,\npurer region, whither thou dost surely purpose to lead me —\nO Thou Whom I shall always call, everywhere and in all Dimensions,\nmy Priest, Philosopher, and Friend — some yet more spacious Space,\nsome more dimensionable Dimensionality, from the vantage-ground\nof which we shall look down together upon the revealed insides\nof Solid things, and where thine own intestines, and those of thy\nkindred Spheres, will lie exposed to the view of the poor wandering\nexile from Flatland, to whom so much has already been vouchsafed.",
        "SPHERE.  Pooh!  Stuff!  Enough of this trifling!  The time is short,\nand much remains to be done before you are fit to proclaim the Gospel\nof Three Dimensions to your blind benighted countrymen in Flatland.",
        "I.  Nay, gracious Teacher, deny me not what I know it is\nin thy power to perform.  Grant me but one glimpse of thine interior,\nand I am satisfied for ever, remaining henceforth thy docile pupil,\nthy unemancipable slave, ready to receive all thy teachings\nand to feed upon the words that fall from thy lips.",
        "SPHERE.  Well, then, to content and silence you, let me say at once,\nI would shew you what you wish if I could; but I cannot.\nWould you have me turn my stomach inside out to oblige you?",
        "I.  But my Lord has shewn me the intestines of all my countrymen\nin the Land of Two Dimensions by taking me with him\ninto the Land of Three.  What therefore more easy than now\nto take his servant on a second journey into the blessed region\nof the Fourth Dimension, where I shall look down with him once more\nupon this land of Three Dimensions, and see the inside\nof every three-dimensioned house, the secrets of the solid earth,\nthe treasures of the mines in Spaceland, and the intestines of every\nsolid living creature, even of the noble and adorable Spheres.",
        "SPHERE.  But where is this land of Four Dimensions?",
        "I.  I know not:  but doubtless my Teacher knows.",
        "SPHERE.  Not I.  There is no such land.  The very idea of it\nis utterly inconceivable.",
        "I.  Not inconceivable, my Lord, to me, and therefore still less\ninconceivable to my Master.  Nay, I despair not that, even here,\nin this region of Three Dimensions, your Lordship’s art\nmay make the Fourth Dimension visible to me; just as in the Land\nof Two Dimensions my Teacher’s skill would fain have opened the eyes\nof his blind servant to the invisible presence of a Third Dimension,\nthough I saw it not.",
        "Let me recall the past.  Was I not taught below that when I saw a Line\nand inferred a Plane, I in reality saw a Third unrecognized Dimension,\nnot the same as brightness, called “height”?  And does it not now\nfollow that, in this region, when I see a Plane and infer a Solid,\nI really see a Fourth unrecognized Dimension, not the same as colour,\nbut existent, though infinitesimal and incapable of measurement?",
        "And besides this, there is the Argument from Analogy of Figures.",
        "SPHERE.  Analogy!  Nonsense:  what analogy?",
        "I.  Your Lordship tempts his servant to see whether he remembers\nthe revelations imparted to him.  Trifle not with me, my Lord;\nI crave, I thirst, for more knowledge.  Doubtless we cannot SEE\nthat other higher Spaceland now, because we we have no eye\nin our stomachs.  But, just as there WAS the realm of Flatland,\nthough that poor puny Lineland Monarch could neither turn to left\nnor right to discern it, and just as there WAS close at hand,\nand touching my frame, the land of Three Dimensions,\nthough I, blind senseless wretch, had no power to touch it,\nno eye in my interior to discern it, so of a surety there is\na Fourth Dimension, which my Lord perceives with the inner eye\nof thought.  And that it must exist my Lord himself has taught me.\nOr can he have forgotten what he himself imparted to his servant?",
        "In One Dimension, did not a moving Point produce a Line\nwith TWO terminal points?",
        "In Two Dimensions, did not a moving Line produce a Square\nwith FOUR terminal points?",
        "In Three Dimensions, did not a moving Square produce —\ndid not this eye of mine behold it — that blessed Being, a Cube,\nwith EIGHT terminal points?",
        "And in Four Dimensions shall not a moving Cube — alas, for Analogy,\nand alas for the Progress of Truth, if it be not so — shall not,\nI say, the motion of a divine Cube result in a still more divine\nOrganization with SIXTEEN terminal points?",
        "Behold the infallible confirmation of the Series, 2, 4, 8, 16:\nis not this a Geometrical Progression?  Is not this — if I might\nquote my Lord’s own words — “strictly according to Analogy”?",
        "Again, was I not taught by my Lord that as in a Line there are\nTWO bounding Points, and in a Square there are FOUR\nbounding Lines, so in a Cube there must be SIX bounding Squares?\nBehold once more the confirming Series, 2, 4, 6:  is not this\nan Arithmetical Progression?  And consequently does it not\nof necessity follow that the more divine offspring of the divine Cube\nin the Land of Four Dimensions, must have 8 bounding Cubes:\nand is not this also, as my Lord has taught me to believe,\n“strictly according to Analogy”?",
        "O, my Lord, my Lord, behold, I cast myself in faith upon conjecture,\nnot knowing the facts; and I appeal to your Lordship to confirm\nor deny my logical anticipations.  If I am wrong, I yield,\nand will no longer demand a fourth Dimension; but, if I am right,\nmy Lord will listen to reason.",
        "I ask therefore, is it, or is it not, the fact, that ere now\nyour countrymen also have witnessed the descent of Beings\nof a higher order than their own, entering closed rooms,\neven as your Lordship entered mine, without the opening of doors\nor windows, and appearing and vanishing at will?  On the reply\nto this question I am ready to stake everything.  Deny it,\nand I am henceforth silent.  Only vouchsafe an answer.",
        "SPHERE.  (AFTER A PAUSE).  It is reported so.  But men are divided\nin opinion as to the facts.  And even granting the facts,\nthey explain them in different ways.  And in any case,\nhowever great may be the number of different explanations,\nno one has adopted or suggested the theory of a Fourth Dimension.\nTherefore, pray have done with this trifling, and let us return\nto business.",
        "I.  I was certain of it.  I was certain that my anticipations\nwould be fulfilled.  And now have patience with me and answer me yet\none more question, best of Teachers!  Those who have thus appeared —\nno one knows whence — and have returned — no one knows whither —\nhave they also contracted their sections and vanished somehow into\nthat more Spacious Space, whither I now entreat you to conduct me?",
        "SPHERE (MOODILY).  They have vanished, certainly —\nif they ever appeared.  But most people say that these visions arose\nfrom the thought — you will not understand me — from the brain;\nfrom the perturbed angularity of the Seer.",
        "I.  Say they so?  Oh, believe them not.  Or if it indeed be so,\nthat this other Space is really Thoughtland, then take me to\nthat blessed Region where I in Thought shall see the insides\nof all solid things.  There, before my ravished eye, a Cube,\nmoving in some altogether new direction, but strictly according\nto Analogy, so as to make every particle of his interior pass through\na new kind of Space, with a wake of its own — shall create\na still more perfect perfection than himself, with sixteen terminal\nExtra-solid angles, and Eight solid Cubes for his Perimeter.\nAnd once there, shall we stay our upward course?  In that blessed\nregion of Four Dimensions, shall we linger on the threshold\nof the Fifth, and not enter therein?  Ah, no!  Let us rather resolve\nthat our ambition shall soar with our corporal ascent.  Then,\nyielding to our intellectual onset, the gates of the Sixth Dimension\nshall fly open; after that a Seventh, and then an Eighth --",
        "How long I should have continued I know not.  In vain did the Sphere,\nin his voice of thunder, reiterate his command of silence,\nand threaten me with the direst penalties if I persisted.\nNothing could stem the flood of my ecstatic aspirations.\nPerhaps I was to blame; but indeed I was intoxicated with\nthe recent draughts of Truth to which he himself had introduced me.\nHowever, the end was not long in coming.  My words were cut short\nby a crash outside, and a simultaneous crash inside me,\nwhich impelled me through space with a velocity that precluded speech.\nDown! down! down! I was rapidly descending; and I knew\nthat return to Flatland was my doom.  One glimpse, one last\nand never-to-be-forgotten glimpse I had of that dull\nlevel wilderness — which was now to become my Universe again —\nspread out before my eye.  Then a darkness.  Then a final,\nall-consummating thunder-peal; and, when I came to myself,\nI was once more a common creeping Square, in my Study at home,\nlistening to the Peace-Cry of my approaching Wife.",
