        "For more than two hundred years during the Middle Ages the Christian\ncountries of Europe were attacked on the southwest by the Saracens\nof Spain, and on the northwest by the Norsemen, or Northmen.  The\nNorthmen were so called because they came into Middle Europe from\nthe north.  Sometimes they were called Vikings (Vi’-kings), or\npirates, because they were adventurous sea-robbers who plundered\nall countries which they could reach by sea.",
        "Their ships were long and swift.  In the center was placed a single\nmast, which carried one large sail.  For the most part, however,\nthe Norsemen depended on rowing, not on the wind, and sometimes\nthere were twenty rowers in one vessel.",
        "The Vikings were a terror to all their neighbors; but the two\nregions that suffered most from their attacks were the Island of\nBritain and that part of Charlemagne’s empire in which the Franks\nwere settled.",
        "Nearly fifty times in two hundred years the lands of the Franks\nwere invaded.  The Vikings sailed up the large rivers into the heart\nof the region which we now call France and captured and pillaged\ncities and towns.  Some years after Charlemagne’s death they went\nas far as his capital, Aix (aks), took the place, and stabled their\nhorses in the cathedral which the great emperor had built.",
        "In the year 860 they discovered Iceland and made a settlement upon\nits shores.  A few years later they sailed as far as Greenland,\nand there established settlements which existed for about a century.",
        "These Vikings were the first discoverers of the continent on which\nwe live.  Ancient books found in Iceland tell the story of the\ndiscovery.  It is related that a Viking ship was driven during a\nstorm to a strange coast, which is thought to have been that part\nof America now known as Labrador.",
        "When the captain of the ship returned home he told what he had\nseen.  His tale so excited the curiosity of a young Viking prince,\ncalled Leif the Lucky, that he sailed to the newly discovered coast.",
        "Going ashore, he found that the country abounded in wild grapes;\nand so he called it Vinland, or the land of Vines.  Vinland is\nthought to have been a part of what is now the Rhode Island coast.",
        "The Vikings were not aware that they had found a great unknown\ncontinent.  No one in the more civilized parts of Europe knew anything\nabout their discovery; and after a while the story of the Vinland\nvoyages seems to have been forgotten, even among the Vikings\nthemselves.",
        "So it is not to them that we owe the discovery of America, but to\nColumbus; because his discovery, though nearly five hundred years\nlater than that of the Norsemen, actually made known to all Europe,\nfor all time, the existence of the New World.",
        "The Vikings had many able chieftains.  One of the most famous was\nRollo the Walker, so called because he was such a giant that no\nhorse strong enough to carry him could be found, and therefore he\nalways had to walk.  However, he did on foot what few could do on\nhorseback.",
        "In 885 seven hundred ships, commanded by Rollo and other Viking\nchiefs, left the harbors of Norway, sailed to the mouth of the\nSeine (San), and started up the river to capture the city of Paris.",
        "Rollo and his men stopped on the way at Rouen (rö-on’), which also\nwas on the Seine, but nearer its mouth.  The citizens had heard of\nthe giant, and when they saw the river covered by his fleet they\nwere dismayed.  However, the bishop of Rouen told them that Rollo\ncould be as noble and generous as he was fierce; and he advised\nthem to open their gates and trust to the mercy of the Viking chief.\nThis was done, and Rollo marched into Rouen and took possession of\nit.  The bishop had given good advice, for Rollo treated the people\nvery kindly.",
        "Soon after capturing Rouen he left the place, sailed up the river\nto Paris, and joined the other Viking chiefs.  And now for six long\nmiles the beautiful Seine was covered with Viking vessels, which\ncarried an army of thirty thousand men.",
        "A noted warrior named Eudes (Ude) was Count of Paris, and he had\nadvised the Parisians to fortify the city.  So not long before the\narrival of Rollo and his companions, two walls with strong gates\nhad been built round Paris.",
        "It was no easy task for even Vikings to capture a strongly walled\ncity.  We are told that Rollo and his men built a high tower and\nrolled it on wheels up to the walls.  At its top was a floor well\nmanned with soldiers.  But the people within the city shot hundreds\nof arrows at the besiegers, and threw down rocks, or poured boiling\noil and pitch upon them.",
        "The Vikings thought to starve the Parisians, and for thirteen months\nthey encamped round the city.  At length food became very scarce,\nand Count Eudes determined to go for help.  He went out through one\nof the gates on a dark, stormy night, and rode post-haste to the\nking.  He told him that something must be done to save the people\nof Paris.",
        "So the king gathered an army and marched to the city.  No battle\nwas fought—the Vikings seemed to have been afraid to risk one.\nThey gave up the siege, and Paris was relieved.",
        "Rollo and his men went to the Duchy of Burgundy, where, as now,\nthe finest crops were raised and the best of wines were made.",
        "Perhaps after a time Rollo and his Vikings went home; but we do not\nknow what he did for about twenty-five years.  We do know that he\nabandoned his old home in Norway in 911.  Then he and his people\nsailed from the icy shore of Norway and again went up the Seine in\nhundreds of Viking vessels.",
        "Of course, on arriving in the land of the Franks, Rollo at once\nbegan to plunder towns and farms.",
        "Charles, then king of the Franks, although his people called him\nthe Simple, or Senseless, had sense enough to see that this must\nbe stopped.",
        "So he sent a message to Rollo and proposed that they should have\na talk about peace.  Rollo agreed and accordingly they met.  The\nking and his troops stood on one side of a little river, and Rollo\nwith his Vikings stood on the other.  Messages passed between them.\nThe king asked Rollo what he wanted.",
        "“Let me and my people live in the land of the Franks; let us make\nourselves home here, and I and my Vikings will become your vassals,\"\nanswered Rollo.  He asked for Rouen and the neighboring land.  So\nthe king gave him that part of Francia; and ever since it has been\ncalled Normandy, the land of the Northmen.",
        "When it was decided that the Vikings should settle in Francia and\nbe subjects of the Frankish king, Rollo was told that he must kiss\nthe foot of Charles in token that he would be the king’s vassal.\nThe haughty Viking refused.  “Never,” said he, “will I bend my\nknee before any man, and no man’s foot will I kiss.”  After some\npersuasion, however, he ordered one of his men to perform the act\nof homage for him.  The king was on horseback and the Norseman,\nstanding by the side of the horse, suddenly seized the king’s foot\nand drew it up to his lips.  This almost made the king fall from\nhis horse, to the great amusement of the Norsemen.",
        "Becoming a vassal to the king meant that if the king went to war\nRollo would be obliged to join his army and bring a certain number\nof armed men—one thousand or more.",
        "Rollo now granted parts of Normandy to his leading men on condition\nthat they would bring soldiers to his army and fight under him.\nThey became his vassals, as he was the king’s vassal.",
        "The lands granted to vassals in this way were called feuds, and\nthis plan of holding lands was called the Feudal System.",
        "It was established in every country of Europe during the Middle\nAges.",
        "The poorest people were called serfs.  They were almost slaves and\nwere never permitted to leave the estate to which they belonged.\nThey did all the work.  They worked chiefly for the landlords, but\npartly for themselves.",
        "Having been a robber himself, Rollo knew what a shocking thing it\nwas to ravage and plunder, and he determined to change his people’s\nhabits.  He made strict laws and hanged robbers.  His duchy thus\nbecame one of the safest parts of Europe.",
        "The Northmen learned the language of the Franks and adopted their\nreligion.",
        "The story of Rollo is especially interesting to us, because Rollo\nwas the forefather of that famous Duke of Normandy who, less than a\nhundred and fifty years later, conquered England and brought into\nthat country the Norman nobles with their French language and\ncustoms.",
