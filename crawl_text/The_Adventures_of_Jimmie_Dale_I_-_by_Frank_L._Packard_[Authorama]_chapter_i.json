        "Among New York’s fashionable and ultra-exclusive clubs, the St.\nJames stood an acknowledged leader–more men, perhaps, cast an\nenvious eye at its portals, of modest and unassuming taste, as they\npassed by on Fifth Avenue, than they did at any other club upon the\nlong list that the city boasts.  True, there were more expensive\nclubs upon whose membership roll scintillated more stars of New\nYork’s social set, but the St. James was distinctive.  It guaranteed\na man, so to speak–that is, it guaranteed a man to be innately a\ngentleman.  It required money, it is true, to keep up one’s\nmembership, but there were many members who were not wealthy, as\nwealth is measured nowadays–there were many, even, who were pressed\nsometimes to meet their dues and their house accounts, but the\naccounts were invariably promptly paid.  No man, once in, could ever\nafford, or ever had the desire, to resign from the St. James Club.\nIts membership was cosmopolitan; men of every walk in life passed in\nand out of its doors, professional men and business men, physicians,\nartists, merchants, authors, engineers, each stamped with the\n\"hall mark” of the St. James, an innate gentleman.  To receive a two\nweeks’ out-of-town visitor’s card to the St. James was something to\nspeak about, and men from Chicago, St. Louis, or San Francisco spoke\nof it with a sort of holier-than-thou air to fellow members of their\nown exclusive clubs, at home again.",
        "Is there any doubt that Jimmie Dale was a gentleman–an INNATE\ngentleman?  Jimmie Dale’s father had been a member of the St. James\nClub, and one of the largest safe manufacturers of the United\nStates, a prosperous, wealthy man, and at Jimmie Dale’s birth he had\nproposed his son’s name for membership.  It took some time to get\ninto the St. James; there was a long waiting list that neither\nmoney, influence, nor pull could alter by so much as one iota.  Men\nproposed their sons’ names for membership when they were born as\nreligiously as they entered them upon the city’s birth register.  At\ntwenty-one Jimmie Dale was elected to membership; and, incidentally,\nthat same year, graduated from Harvard.  It was Mr. Dale’s desire\nthat his son should enter the business and learn it from the ground\nup, and Jimmie Dale, for four years thereafter, had followed his\nfather’s wishes.  Then his father died.  Jimmie Dale had leanings\ntoward more artistic pursuits than business.  He was credited with\nsketching a little, writing a little; and he was credited with\nhaving received a very snug amount from the combine to which he sold\nout his safe-manufacturing interests.  He lived a bachelor life–his\nmother had been dead many years–in the house that his father had\nleft him on Riverside Drive, kept a car or two and enough servants\nto run his menage smoothly, and serve a dinner exquisitely when he\nfelt hospitably inclined.",
        "Could there be any doubt that Jimmie Dale was innately a gentleman?",
        "It was evening, and Jimmie Dale sat at a small table in the corner\nof the St. James Club dining room.  Opposite him sat Herman\nCarruthers, a young man of his own age, about twenty-six, a leading\nfigure in the newspaper world, whose rise from reporter to managing\neditor of the morning NEWS-ARGUS within the short space of a few\nyears had been almost meteoric.",
        "They were at coffee and cigars, and Jimmie Dale was leaning back in\nhis chair, his dark eyes fixed interestedly on his guest.",
        "Carruthers, intently engaged in trimming his cigar ash on the edge\nof the Limoges china saucer of his coffee set, looked up with an\nabrupt laugh.",
        "“No; I wouldn’t care to go on record as being an advocate of crime,\"\nhe said whimsically; “that would never do.  But I don’t mind\nadmitting quite privately that it’s been a positive regret to me\nthat he has gone.”",
        "“Made too good ’copy’ to lose, I suppose?” suggested Jimmie Dale\nquizzically.  “Too bad, too, after working up a theatrical name like\nthat for him–the Gray Seal–rather unique!  Who stuck that on him–\nyou?”",
        "Carruthers laughed–then, grown serious, leaned toward Jimmie Dale.",
        "“You don’t mean to say, Jimmie, that you don’t know about that, do\nyou?” he asked incredulously.  “Why, up to a year ago the papers\nwere full of him.”",
        "“I never read your beastly agony columns,” said Jimmie Dale, with a\ncheery grin.",
        "“Well,” said Carruthers, “you must have skipped everything but the\nstock reports then.”",
        "“Granted,” said Jimmie Dale.  “So go on, Carruthers, and tell me\nabout him–I dare say I may have heard of him, since you are so\ndistressed about it, but my memory isn’t good enough to contradict\nanything you may have to say about the estimable gentleman, so\nyou’re safe.”",
        "Carruthers reverted to the Limoges saucer and the tip of his cigar.",
        "“He was the most puzzling, bewildering, delightful crook in the\nannals of crime,” said Carruthers reminiscently, after a moment’s\nsilence.  “Jimmie, he was the king-pin of them all.  Clever isn’t\nthe word for him, or dare-devil isn’t either.  I used to think\nsometimes his motive was more than half for the pure deviltry of it,\nto laugh at the police and pull the noses of the rest of us that\nwere after him.  I used to dream nights about those confounded gray\nseals of his–that’s where he got his name; he left every job he\never did with a little gray paper affair, fashioned diamond-shaped,\nstuck somewhere where it would be the first thing your eyes would\nlight upon when you reached the scene, and–”",
        "“Don’t go so fast,” smiled Jimmie Dale.  “I don’t quite get the\nconnection.  What did you have to do with this–er–Gray Seal\nfellow?  Where do you come in?”",
        "“I?  I had a good deal to do with him,” said Carruthers grimly.  “I\nwas a reporter when he first broke loose, and the ambition of my\nlife, after I began really to appreciate what he was, was to get\nhim–and I nearly did, half a dozen times, only–”",
        "“Only you never quite did, eh?” cut in Jimmie Dale slyly.  “How near\ndid you get, old man?  Come on, now, no bluffing; did the Gray Seal\never even recognise you as a factor in the hare-and-hound game?”",
        "“You’re flicking on the raw, Jimmie,” Carruthers answered, with a\nwry grimace.  “He knew me, all right, confound him!  He favoured me\nwith several sarcastic notes–I’ll show ’em to you some day–\nexplaining how I’d fallen down and how I could have got him if I’d\ndone something else.”  Carruthers’ fist came suddenly down on the\ntable.  “And I would have got him, too, if he had lived.”",
        "“Lived!” ejaculated Jimmie Dale.  “He’s dead, then?”",
        "“Yes,” averted Carruthers; “he’s dead.”",
        "“H’m!” said Jimmie Dale facetiously.  “I hope the size of the wreath\nyou sent was an adequate tribute of your appreciation.”",
        "“I never sent any wreath,” returned Carruthers, “for the very simple\nreason that I didn’t know where to send it, or when he died.  I said\nhe was dead because for over a year now he hasn’t lifted a finger.”",
        "“Rotten poor evidence, even for a newspaper,” commented Jimmie Dale.\n\"Why not give him credit for having, say–reformed?”",
        "Carruthers shook his head.  “You don’t get it at all, Jimmie,” he\nsaid earnestly.  “The Gray Seal wasn’t an ordinary crook–he was a\nclassic.  He was an artist, and the art of the thing was in his\nblood.  A man like that could no more stop than he could stop\nbreathing–and live.  He’s dead; there’s nothing to it but that–\nhe’s dead.  I’d bet a year’s salary on it.”",
        "“Another good man gone wrong, then,” said Jimmie Dale capriciously.\n\"I suppose, though, that at least you discovered the ’woman in the\ncase’?”",
        "Carruthers looked up quickly, a little startled; then laughed\nshortly.",
        "“What’s the matter?” inquired Jimmie Dale.",
        "“Nothing,” said Carruthers.  “You kind of got me for a moment,\nthat’s all.  That’s the way those infernal notes from the Gray Seal\nused to end up: ’Find the lady, old chap; and you’ll get me.’  He\nhad a damned patronising familiarity that would make you squirm.”",
        "“Poor old Carruthers!” grinned Jimmie Dale.  “You did take it to\nheart, didn’t you?”",
        "“I’d have sold my soul to get him–and so would you, if you had been\nin my boots,” said Carruthers, biting nervously at the end of his\ncigar.",
        "“And been sorry for it afterward,” supplied Jimmie Dale.",
        "“Yes, by Jove, you’re right!” admitted Carruthers, “I suppose I\nshould.  I actually got to love the fellow–it was the GAME, really,\nthat I wanted to beat.”",
        "“Well, and how about this woman?  Keep on the straight and narrow\npath, old man,” prodded Jimmie Dale.",
        "“The woman?” Carruthers smiled.  “Nothing doing!  I don’t believe\nthere was one–he wouldn’t have been likely to egg the police and\nreporters on to finding her if there had been, would he?  It was a\nblind, of course.  He worked alone, absolutely alone.  That’s the\nsecret of his success, according to my way of thinking.  There was\nnever so much as an indication that he had had an accomplice in\nanything he ever did.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes travelled around the club’s homelike, perfectly\nappointed room.  He nodded to a fellow member here and there, then\nhis eyes rested musingly on his guest again.",
        "Carruthers was staring thoughtfully at his coffee cup.",
        "“He was the prince of crooks and the father of originality,\"\nannounced Carruthers abruptly, following the pause that had ensued.\n\"Half the time there wasn’t any more getting at the motive for the\ncurious things he did, than there was getting at the Gray Seal\nhimself.”",
        "“Carruthers,” said Jimmy Dale, with a quick little nod of approval,\n\"you’re positively interesting to-night.  But, so far, you’ve been\nkind of scouting around the outside edges without getting into the\nthick of it.  Let’s have some of your experiences with the Gray Seal\nin detail; they ought to make ripping fine yarns.”",
        "“Not to-night, Jimmie,” said Carruthers; “it would take too long.\"\nHe pulled out his watch mechanically as he spoke, glanced at it–and\npushed back his chair.  “Great Scott!” he exclaimed.  “It’s nearly\nhalf-past nine.  I’d no idea we had lingered so long over dinner.\nI’ll have to hurry; we’re a morning paper, you know, Jimmie.”",
        "“What!  Really!  Is it as late as that.”  Jimmie Dale rose from his\nchair as Carruthers stood up.  “Well, if you must–”",
        "“I must,” said Carruthers, with a laugh.",
        "“All right, O slave.”  Jimmie Dale laughed back–and slipped his\nhand, a trick of their old college days together, through\nCarruthers’ arm as they left the room.",
        "He accompanied Carruthers downstairs to the door of the club, and\nsaw his guest into a taxi; then he returned inside, sauntered\nthrough the billiard room, and from there into one of the cardrooms,\nwhere, pressed into a game, he played several rubbers of bridge\nbefore going home.",
        "It was, therefore, well on toward midnight when Jimmie Dale arrived\nat his house on Riverside Drive, and was admitted by an elderly\nmanservant.",
        "“Hello, Jason,” said Jimmie Dale pleasantly.  “You still up!”",
        "“Yes, sir,” replied Jason, who had been valet to Jimmie Dale’s\nfather before him.  “I was going to bed, sir, at about ten o’clock,\nwhen a messenger came with a letter.  Begging your pardon, sir, a\nyoung lady, and–”",
        "“Jason\"–Jimmie Dale flung out the interruption, sudden, quick,\nimperative–\"what did she look like?”",
        "“Why–why, I don’t exactly know as I could describe her, sir,\"\nstammered Jason, taken aback.  “Very ladylike, sir, in her dress and\nappearance, and what I would call, sir, a beautiful face.”",
        "“Hair and eyes–what color?” demanded Jimmie Dale crisply.  “Nose,\nlips, chin–what shape?”",
        "“Why, sir,” gasped Jason, staring at his master, “I–I don’t rightly\nknow.  I wouldn’t call her fair or dark, something between.  I\ndidn’t take particular notice, and it wasn’t overlight outside the\ndoor.”",
        "“It’s too bad you weren’t a younger man, Jason,” commented Jimmie\nDale, with a curious tinge of bitterness in his voice.  “I’d have\ngiven a year’s income for your opportunity to-night, Jason.”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Jason helplessly.",
        "“Well, go on,” prompted Jimmie Dale.  “You told her I wasn’t home,\nand she said she knew it, didn’t she?  And she left the letter that\nI was on no account to miss receiving when I got back, though there\nwas no need of telephoning me to the club–when I returned would do,\nbut it was imperative that I should have it then–eh?”",
        "“Good Lord, sir!” ejaculated Jason, his jaw dropped, that’s exactly\nwhat she did say.”",
        "“Jason,” said Jimmie Dale grimly, “listen to me.  If ever she comes\nhere again, inveigle her in.  If you can’t inveigle her, use force;\ncapture her, pull her in, do anything–do anything, do you hear?\nOnly don’t let her get away from you until I’ve come.”",
        "Jason gazed at his master as though the other had lost his reason.",
        "“Use force, sir?” he repeated weakly–and shook his head.  “You–you\ncan’t mean that, sir.”",
        "“Can’t I?” inquired Jimmie Dale, with a mirthless smile.  “I mean\nevery word of it, Jason–and if I thought there was the slightest\nchance of her giving you the opportunity, I’d be more imperative\nstill.  As it is–where’s the letter?”",
        "“On the table in your studio, sir,” said Jason, mechanically.",
        "Jimmie Dale started toward the stairs–then turned and came back to\nwhere Jason, still shaking his head heavily, had been gazing\nanxiously after his master.  Jimmie Dale laid his hand on the old\nman’s shoulder.",
        "“Jason,” he said kindly, with a swift change of mood, “you’ve been a\nlong time in the family–first with father, and now with me.  You’d\ndo a good deal for me, wouldn’t you?”",
        "“I’d do anything in the world for you, Master Jim,” said the old man\nearnestly.",
        "“Well, then, remember this,” said Jimmie Dale slowly, looking into\nthe other’s eyes, “remember this–keep your mouth shut and your eyes\nopen.  It’s my fault.  I should have warned you long ago, but I\nnever dreamed that she would ever come here herself.  There have\nbeen times when it was practically a matter of life and death to me\nto know who that woman is that you saw to-night.  That’s all, Jason.\nNow go to bed.”",
        "“Master Jim,” said the old man simply, “thank you, sir, thank you\nfor trusting me.  I’ve dandled you on my knee when you were a baby,\nMaster Jim.  I don’t know what it’s about, and it isn’t for me to\nask.  I thought, sir, that maybe you were having a little fun with\nme.  But I know now, and you can trust me, Master Jim, if she ever\ncomes again.”",
        "“Thank you, Jason,” said Jimmie Dale, his hand closing with an\nappreciative pressure on the other’s shoulder “Good-night, Jason.”",
        "Upstairs on the first landing, Jimmie Dale opened a door, closed and\nlocked it behind him–and the electric switch clicked under his\nfingers.  A glow fell softly from a cluster of shaded ceiling\nlights.  It was a large room, a very large room, running the entire\ndepth of the house, and the effect of apparent disorder in the\narrangement of its appointments seemed to breathe a sense of charm.\nThere were great cozy, deep, leather-covered lounging chairs, a\nhuge, leather-covered davenport, and an easel or two with half-\nfinished sketches upon them; the walls were panelled, the panels of\nexquisite grain and matching; in the centre of the room stood a\nflat-topped rosewood desk; upon the floor was a dark, heavy velvet\nrug; and, perhaps most inviting of all, there was a great, old-\nfashioned fireplace at one side of the room.",
        "For an instant Jimmie Dale remained quietly by the door, as though\nlistening.  Six feet he stood, muscular in every line of his body,\nlike a well-trained athlete with no single ounce of superfluous fat\nabout him–the grace and ease of power in his poise.  His strong,\nclean-shaven face, as the light fell upon it now, was serious–a\nmood that became him well–the firm lips closed, the dark, reliant\neyes a little narrowed, a frown on the broad forehead, the square\njaw clamped.",
        "Then abruptly he walked across the room to the desk, picked up an\nenvelope that lay upon it, and, turning again, dropped into the\nnearest lounging chair.",
        "There had been no doubt in his mind, none to dispel.  It was\nprecisely what he had expected from almost the first word Jason had\nspoken.  It was the same handwriting, the same texture of paper, and\nthere was the same old haunting, rare, indefinable fragrance about\nit.  Jimmie Dale’s hands turned the envelope now this way, now that,\nas he looked at it.  Wonderful hands were Jimmie Dale’s, with long,\nslim, tapering fingers whose sensitive tips seemed now as though\nthey were striving to decipher the message within.",
        "He laughed suddenly, a little harshly, and tore open the envelope.\nFive closely written sheets fell into his hand.  He read them\nslowly, critically, read them over again; and then, his eyes on the\nrug at his feet, he began to tear the paper into minute pieces\nbetween his fingers, depositing the pieces, as he tore them, upon\nthe arm of his chair.  The five sheets demolished, his fingers\ndipped into the heap of shreds on the arm of the chair and tore them\nover and over again, tore them until they were scarcely larger than\nbits of confetti, tore at them absently and mechanically, his eyes\nnever shifting from the rug at his feet.",
        "Then with a shrug of his shoulders, as though rousing himself to\npresent reality, a curious smile flickering on his lips, he brushed\nthe pieces of paper into one hand, carried them to the empty\nfireplace, laid them down in a little pile, and set them afire.\nLighting a cigarette, he watched them burn until the last glow had\ngone from the last charred scrap; then he crunched and scattered\nthem with the brass-handled fender brush, and, retracing his steps\nacross the room, flung back a portiere from where it hung before a\nlittle alcove, and dropped on his knees in front of a round, squat,\nbarrel-shaped safe–one of his own design and planning in the years\nwhen he had been with his father.",
        "His slim, sensitive fingers played for an instant among the knobs\nand dials that studded the door, guided, it seemed by the sense of\ntouch alone–and the door swung open.  Within was another door, with\nlocks and bolts as intricate and massive as the outer one.  This,\ntoo, he opened; and then from the interior took out a short, thick,\nrolled-up leather bundle tied together with thongs.  He rose from\nhis knees, closed the safe, and drew the portiere across the alcove\nagain.  With the bundle under his arm, he glanced sharply around the\nroom, listened intently, then, unlocking the door that gave on the\nhall, he switched off the lights and went to his dressing room, that\nwas on the same floor.  Here, divesting himself quickly of his\ndinner clothes, he selected a dark tweed suit with loose-fitting,\nsack coat from his wardrobe, and began to put it on.",
        "Dressed, all but his coat and vest, he turned to the leather bundle\nthat he had placed on a table, untied the thongs, and carefully\nopened it out to its full length–and again that curious, cryptic\nsmile tinged his lips.  Rolled the opposite away from that in which\nit had been tied up, the leather strip made a wide belt that went on\nsomewhat after the fashion of a life preserver, the thongs being\nused for shoulder straps–a belt that, once on, the vest would hide\ncompletely, and, fitting close, left no telltale bulge in the outer\ngarments.  It was not an ordinary belt; it was full of stout-sewn,\nup-right little pockets all the way around, and in the pockets\ngrimly lay an array of fine, blued-steel, highly tempered\ninstruments–a compact, powerful burglar’s kit.",
        "The slim, sensitive fingers passed with almost a caressing touch\nover the vicious little implements, and from one of the pockets\nextracted a thin, flat metal case.  This Jimmie Dale opened, and\nglanced inside–between sheets of oil paper lay little rows of GRAY,\nADHESIVE, DIAMOND-SHAPED SEALS.",
        "Jimmie Dale snapped the case shut, returned it to its recess, and\nfrom another took out a black silk mask.  He held it up to the light\nfor examination.",
        "“Pretty good shape after a year,” muttered Jimmie Dale, replacing\nit.",
        "He put on the belt, then his vest and coat.  From the drawer of his\ndresser he took an automatic revolver and an electric flashlight,\nslipped them into his pocket, and went softly downstairs.  From the\nhat stand he chose a black slouch hat, pulled it well over his eyes–\nand left the house.",
        "Jimmie Dale walked down a block, then hailed a bus and mounted to\nthe top.  It was late, and he found himself the only passenger.  He\ninserted his dime in the conductor’s little resonant-belled cash\nreceiver, and then settled back on the uncomfortable, bumping,\ncushionless seat.",
        "On rattled the bus; it turned across town, passed the Circle, and\nheaded for Fifth Avenue–but Jimmie Dale, to all appearances, was\nquite oblivious of its movements.",
        "It was a year since she had written him.  SHE!  Jimmie Dale did not\nsmile, his lips were pressed hard together.  Not a very intimate or\npersonal appellation, that–but he knew her by no other.  It WAS a\nwoman, surely–the hand-writing was feminine, the diction eminently\nso–and had SHE not come herself that night to Jason!  He remembered\nthe last letter, apart from the one to-night, that he had received\nfrom her.  It was a year ago now–and the letter had been hardly\nmore than a note.  The police had worked themselves into a frenzy\nover the Gray Seal, the papers had grown absolutely maudlin–and she\nhad written, in her characteristic way:",
        "Things are a little too warm, aren’t they, Jimmie?  Let’s let them\ncool for a year.",
        "Since then until to-night he had heard nothing from her.  It was a\nstrange compact that he had entered into–so strange that it could\nnever have known, could never know a parallel–unique, dangerous,\nbizarre, it was all that and more.  It had begun really through his\nconnection with his father’s business–the business of manufacturing\nsafes that should defy the cleverest criminals–when his brains,\nturned into that channel, had been pitted against the underworld,\nagainst the methods of a thousand different crooks from Maine to\nCalifornia, the report of whose every operation had reached him in\nthe natural course of business, and every one of which he had\nstudied in minutest detail.  It had begun through that–but at the\nbottom of it was his own restless, adventurous spirit.",
        "He had meant to set the police by the ears, using his gray-seal\ndevice both as an added barb and that no innocent bystander of the\nunderworld, innocent for once, might be involved–he had meant to\nlaugh at them and puzzle them to the verge of madness, for in the\nlast analysis they would find only an abortive attempt at crime–and\nhe had succeeded.  And then he had gone too far–and he had been\ncaught–by HER.  That string of pearls, which, to study whose effect\nfacetiously, he had so idiotically wrapped around his wrist, and\nwhich, so ironically, he had been unable to loosen in time and had\nbeen forced to carry with him in his sudden, desperate dash to\nescape from Marx’s the big jeweler’s, in Maiden Lane, whose strong\nroom he had toyed with one night, had been the lever which, AT\nFIRST, she had held over him.",
        "The bus was on Fifth Avenue now, and speeding rapidly down the\ndeserted thoroughfare.  Jimmie Dale looked up at the lighted windows\nof the St. James Club as they went by, smiled whimsically, and\nshifted in his seat, seeking a more comfortable position.",
        "She had caught him–how he did not know–he had never seen her–did\nnot know who she was, though time and again he had devoted all his\nenergies for months at a stretch to a solution of the mystery.  The\nmorning following the Maiden Lane affair, indeed, before he had\nbreakfasted, Jason had brought him the first letter from her.  It\nhad started by detailing his every move of the night before–and it\nhad ended with an ultimatum: “The cleverness, the originality of the\nGray Seal as a crook lacked but one thing,” she had naively written,\n\"and that one thing was that his crookedness required a leading\nstring to guide it into channels that were worthy of his genius.\"\nIn a word, SHE would plan the coups, and he would act at her\ndictation and execute them–or else how did twenty years in Sing\nSing for that little Maiden Lane affair appeal to him?  He was to\nanswer by the next morning, a simple “yes” or “no” in the personal\ncolumn of the morning NEWS-ARGUS.",
        "A threat to a man like Jimmie Dale was like flaunting a red rag at a\nbull, and a rage ungovernable had surged upon him.  Then cold reason\nhad come.  He was caught–there was no question about that–she had\ntaken pains to show him that he need make no mistake there.\nInnocent enough in his own conscience, as far as actual theft went,\nfor the pearls would in due course be restored in some way to the\npossession of their owner, he would have been unable to make even\nhis own father, who was alive then, believe in his innocence, let\nalone a jury of his peers.  Dishonour, shame, ignominy, a long\nprison sentence, stared him in the face, and there was but one\nalternative–to link hands with this unseen, mysterious accomplice.\nWell, he could at least temporise, he could always “queer” a game in\nsome specious manner, if he were pushed too far.  And so, in the\nnext morning’s NEWS-ARGUS, Jimmie Dale had answered “yes.”  And then\nhad followed those years in which there had been NO temporising, in\nwhich every plan was carried out to the last detail, those years of\ncurious, unaccountable, bewildering affairs that Carruthers had\nspoken of, one on top of another, that had shaken the old\nheadquarters on Mulberry Street to its foundations, until the Gray\nSeal had become a name to conjure with.  And, yes, it was quite\ntrue, he had entered into it all, gone the limit, with an eagerness\nthat was insatiable.",
        "The bus had reached the lower end of Fifth Avenue, passed through\nWashington Square, and stopped at the end of its run.  Jimmie Dale\nclambered down from the top, threw a pleasant “good-night” to the\nconductor, and headed briskly down the street before him.  A little\nlater he crossed into West Broadway, and his pace slowed to a\nleisurely stroll.",
        "Here, at the upper end of the street, was a conglomerate business\nsection of rather inferior class, catering doubtless to the poor,\nforeign element that congregated west of Broadway proper, and to the\nsouth of Washington Square.  The street was, at first glance,\ndeserted; it was dark and dreary, with stores and lofts on either\nside.  An elevated train roared by overhead, with a thunderous,\ndeafening clamour.  Jimmie Dale, on the right-hand side of the\nstreet, glanced interestedly at the dark store windows as he went\nby.  And then, a block ahead, on the other side, his eyes rested on\nan approaching form.  As the other reached the corner and paused,\nand the light from the street lamp glinted on brass buttons, Jimmie\nDale’s eyes narrowed a little under his slouch hat.  The policeman,\nalthough nonchalantly swinging a nightstick, appeared to be watching\nhim.",
        "Jimmie Dale went on half a block farther, stooped to the sidewalk to\ntie his shoe, glanced back over his shoulder–the policeman was not\nin sight–and slipped like a shadow into the alleyway beside which\nhe had stopped.",
        "It was another Jimmie Dale now–the professional Jimmie Dale.  Quick\nas a cat, active, lithe, he was over a six foot fence in the rear of\na building in a flash, and crouched a black shape, against the back\ndoor of an unpretentious, unkempt, dirty, secondhand shop that\nfronted on West Broadway–the last place certainly in all New York\nthat the managing editor of the NEWS-ARGUS, or any one else, for\nthat matter, would have picked out as the setting for the second\ndebut of the Gray Seal.",
        "From the belt around his waist, Jimmie Dale took the black silk\nmask, and slipped it on; and from the belt, too, came a little\ninstrument that his deft fingers manipulated in the lock.  A curious\nsnipping sound followed.  Jimmie Dale put his weight gradually\nagainst the door.  The door held fast.",
        "“Bolted,” said Jimmie Dale to himself.",
        "The sensitive fingers travelled slowly up and down the side of the\ndoor, seeming to press and feel for the position of the bolt through\nan inch of plank–then from the belt came a tiny saw, thin and\npointed at the end, that fitted into the little handle drawn from\nanother receptacle in the leather girdle beneath the unbuttoned\nvest.",
        "Hardly a sound it made as it bit into the door.  Half a minute\npassed–there was the faint fall of a small piece of wood–into the\naperture crept the delicate, tapering fingers–came a slight rasping\nof metal–then the door swung back, the dark shadow that had been\nJimmie Dale vanished and the door closed again.",
        "A round, white beam of light glowed for an instant–and disappeared.\nA miscellaneous, lumbering collection of junk and odds and ends\nblocked the entry, leaving no more space than was sufficient for\nbare passageway.  Jimmie Dale moved cautiously–and once more the\nflashlight in his hand showed the way for an instant–then darkness\nagain.",
        "The cluttered accumulation of secondhand stuff in the rear gave\nplace to a little more orderly arrangement as he advanced toward the\nfront of the store.  Like a huge firefly, the flashlight twinkled,\nwent out, twinkled again, and went out.  He passed a sort of crude,\npartitioned-off apartment that did duty for the establishment’s\noffice, a sort of little boxed-in place it was, about in the middle\nof the floor.  Jimmie Dale’s light played on it for a moment.  but\nhe kept on toward the front door without any pause.",
        "Every movement was quick, sure, accurate, with not a wasted second.\nIt had been barely a minute since he had vaulted the back fence.  It\nwas hardly a quarter of a minute more before the cumbersome lock of\nthe front door was unfastened, and the door itself pulled\nimperceptibly ajar.",
        "He went swiftly back to the office now–and found it even more of a\nshaky, cheap affair than it had at first appeared; more like a box\nstall with windows around the top than anything else, the windows\ndoubtless to permit the occupant to overlook the store from the\nvantage point of the high stool that stood before a long, battered,\nwobbly desk.  There was a door to the place, too, but the door was\nopen and the key was in the lock.  The ray of Jimmie Dale’s\nflashlight swept once around the interior–and rested on an antique,\nponderous safe.",
        "Under the mask Jimmie Dale’s lips parted in a smile that seemed\nalmost apologetic, as he viewed the helpless iron monstrosity that\nwas little more than an insult to a trained cracksman.  Then from\nthe belt came the thin metal case and a pair of tweezers.  He opened\nthe case, and with the tweezers lifted out one of the gray-coloured,\ndiamond-shaped seals.  Holding the seal with the tweezers, he\nmoistened the gummed side with his lips, then laid it on a\nhandkerchief which he took from his pocket, and clapped the\nhandkerchief against the front of the safe, sticking the seal\nconspicuously into place.  Jimmie Dale’s insignia bore no finger\nprints.  The microscopes and magnifying glasses at headquarters had\nmany a time regretfully assured the police of that fact.",
        "And now his hands and fingers seemed to work like lightning.  Into\nthe soft iron bit a drill–bit in and through–bit in and through\nagain.  It was dark, pitch black–and silent.  Not a sound, save the\nquick, dull rasp of the ratchet–like the distant gnawing of a\nmouse!  Jimmie Dale worked fast–another hole went through the face\nof the old-fashioned safe–and then suddenly he straightened up to\nlisten, every faculty tense, alert, and strained, his body thrown a\nlittle forward.  WHAT WAS THAT!",
        "From the alleyway leading from the street without, through which he\nhimself had come, sounded the stealthy crunch of feet.  Motionless\nin the utter darkness, Jimmie Dale listened–there was a scraping\nnoise in the rear–someone was climbing the fence that he had\nclimbed!",
        "In an instant the tools in Jimmie Dale’s hands disappeared into\ntheir respective pockets beneath his vest–and the sensitive fingers\nshot to the dial on the safe.",
        "“Too bad,” muttered Jimmie Dale plaintively to himself.  I could\nhave made such an artistic job of it–I swear I could have cut\nCarruthers’ profile in the hole in less than no time–to open it\nlike this is really taking the poor old thing at a disadvantage.”",
        "He was on his knees now, one ear close to the dial, listening as the\ntumblers fell, while the delicate fingers spun the knob unerringly–\nthe other ear strained toward the rear of the premises.",
        "Came a footstep–a ray of light–a stumble–nearer–the newcomer was\ninside the place now, and must have found out that the back door had\nbeen tampered with.  Nearer came the steps–still nearer–and then\nthe safe door swung open under Jimmie Dale’s hand, and Jimmie Dale,\nthat he might not be caught like a rat in a trap, darted from the\noffice–but he had delayed a little too long.",
        "From around the cluttered piles of junk and miscellany swept the\nlight–full on Jimmie Dale.  Hesitation for the smallest fraction of\na second would have been fatal, but hesitation was something that in\nall his life Jimmie Dale had never known.  Quick as a panther in its\nspring, he leaped full at the light and the man behind it.  The\nrough voice, in surprised exclamation at the sudden discovery of the\nquarry, died in a gasp.",
        "There was a crash as the two men met–and the other reeled back\nbefore the impact.  Onto him Jimmie Dale sprang, and his hands flew\nfor the other’s throat.  It was an officer in uniform!  Jimmie Dale\nhad felt the brass buttons as they locked.  In the darkness there\nwas a queer smile on Jimmie Dale’s tight lips.  It was no doubt THE\nofficer whom he had passed on the other side of the street.",
        "The other was a smaller man than Jimmie Dale, but powerful for his\nbuild–and he fought now with all his strength.  This way and that\nthe two men reeled, staggered, swayed, panting and gasping; and\nthen–they had lurched back close to the office door–with a sudden\nswing, every muscle brought into play for a supreme effort, Jimmie\nDale hurled the other from him, sending the man sprawling back to\nthe floor of the office, and in the winking of an eye had slammed\nshut the door and turned the key.",
        "There was a bull-like roar, the shrill CHEEP-CHEEP-CHEEP of the\npatrolman’s whistle, and a shattering crash as the officer flung his\nbody against the partition–then the bark of a revolver shot, the\ntinkle of breaking glass, as the man fired through the office\nwindow–and past Jimmie Dale, speeding now for the front door, a\nbullet hummed viciously.",
        "Out on the street dashed Jimmie Dale, whipping the mask from his\nface–and glanced like a hawk around him.  For all the racket, the\nneighbourhood had not yet been aroused–no one was in sight.  From\njust overhead came the rattle of a downtown elevated train.  In a\nhundred-yard sprint, Jimmie Dale raced it a half block to the\nstation, tore up the steps–and a moment later dropped nonchalantly\ninto a seat and pulled an evening newspaper from his pocket.",
        "Jimmie Dale got off at the second station down, crossed the street,\nmounted the steps of the elevated again, and took the next train\nuptown.  His movements appeared to be somewhat erratic–he alighted\nat the station next above the one by which he had made his escape.\nLooking down the street it was too dark to see much of anything, but\na confused noise as of a gathering crowd reached him from what was\nabout the location of the secondhand store.  He listened\nappreciatively for a moment.",
        "“Isn’t it a perfectly lovely night?” said Jimmie Dale amiably to\nhimself.  “And to think of that cop running away with the idea that\nI didn’t see him when he hid in a doorway after I passed the corner!\nWell, well, strange–isn’t it?”",
        "With another glance down the street, a whimsical lift of his\nshoulders, he headed west into the dilapidated tenement quarter that\nhuddled for a handful of blocks near by, just south of Washington\nSquare.  It was a little after one o’clock in the morning now and\nthe pedestrians were casual.  Jimmie Dale read the street signs on\nthe corners as he went along, turned abruptly into an intersecting\nstreet, counted the tenements from the corner as he passed, and–for\nthe eye of any one who might be watching–opened the street door of\none of them quite as though he were accustomed and had a perfect\nright to do so, and went inside.",
        "It was murky and dark within; hot, unhealthy, with lingering smells\nof garlic and stale cooking.  He groped for the stairs and started\nup.  He climbed one flight, then another–and one more to the top.\nHere, treading softly, he made an examination of the landing with a\nview, evidently, to obtaining an idea of the location and the number\nof doors that opened off from it.",
        "His selection fell on the third door from the head of the stairs–\nthere were four all told, two apartments of two rooms each.  He\npaused for an instant to adjust the black silk mask, tried the door\nquietly, found it unlocked, opened it with a sudden, quick, brisk\nmovement–and, stepping in side, leaned with his back against it.",
        "“Good-morning,” said Jimmie Dale pleasantly.",
        "It was a squalid place, a miserable hole, in which a single\nflickering, yellow gas jet gave light.  It was almost bare of\nfurniture; there was nothing but a couple of cheap chairs, a rickety\ntable–unpawnable.  A boy, he was hardly more than that, perhaps\ntwenty-two, from a posture in which he was huddled across the table\nwith head buried in out-flung arms, sprang with a startled cry to\nhis feet.",
        "“Good-morning,” said Jimmie Dale again.  “Your name’s Hagan, Bert\nHagan–isn’t it?  And you work for Isaac Brolsky in the secondhand\nshop over on West Broadway–don’t you?”",
        "The boy’s lips quivered, and the gaunt, hollow, half-starved face,\nwhite, ashen-white now, was pitiful.",
        "“I–I guess you got me,” he faltered “I–I suppose you’re a plain-\nclothes man, though I never knew dicks wore masks.”",
        "“They don’t generally,” said Jimmie Dale coolly.  “It’s a fad of\nmine–Bert Hagan.”",
        "The lad, hanging to the table, turned his head away for a moment–\nand there was silence.",
        "Presently Hagan spoke again.  “I’ll go,” he said numbly.  I won’t\nmake any trouble.  Would–would you mind not speaking loud?  I–I\nwouldn’t like her to know.”",
        "“Her?” said Jimmie Dale softly.",
        "The boy tiptoed across the room, opened a connecting door a little,\npeered inside, opened it a little wider–and looked over his\nshoulder at Jimmie Dale.",
        "Jimmie Dale crossed to the boy, looked inside the other room–and\nhis lip twitched queerly, as the sight sent a quick, hurt throb\nthrough his heart.  A young woman, younger than the boy, lay on a\ntumble-down bed, a rag of clothing over her–her face with a\ndeathlike pallor upon it, as she lay in what appeared to be a\nstupor.  She was ill, critically ill; it needed no trained eye to\ndiscern a fact all too apparent to the most casual observer.  The\nsqualor, the glaring poverty here, was even more pitifully in\nevidence than in the other room–only here upon a chair beside the\nbed was a cluster of medicine bottles and a little heap of fruit.",
        "Jimmie Dale drew back silently as the boy closed the door.",
        "Hagan walked to the table and picked up his hat.",
        "“I’m–I’m ready,” he said brokenly.  “Let’s go.”",
        "“Just a minute,” said Jimmie Dale.  “Tell us about it.”",
        "“Twon’t take long,” said Hagan, trying to smile.  “She’s my wife.\nThe sickness took all we had.  I–I kinder got behind in the rent\nand things.  They were going to fire us out of here–to-morrow.  And\nthere wasn’t any money for the medicine, and–and the things she had\nto have.  Maybe you wouldn’t have done it–but I did.  I couldn’t\nsee her dying there for the want of something a little money’d buy–\nand–and I couldn’t\"–he caught his voice in a little sob–\"I\ncouldn’t see her thrown out on the street like that.”",
        "“And so,” said Jimmie Dale, “instead of putting old Isaac’s cash in\nthe safe this evening when you locked up, you put it in your pocket\ninstead–eh?  Didn’t you know you’d get caught?”",
        "“What did it matter?” said the boy.  He was twirling his misshappen\nhat between his fingers.  “I knew they’d know it was me in the\nmorning when old Isaac found it gone, because there wasn’t anybody\nelse to do it.  But I paid the rent for four months ahead to-night,\nand I fixed it so’s she’d have medicine and things to eat.  I was\ngoing to beat it before daylight myself–I\"–he brushed his hand\nhurriedly across his cheek–\"I didn’t want to go–to leave her till\nI had to.”",
        "“Well, say\"–there was wonderment in Jimmie Dale’s tones, and his\nEnglish lapsed into ungrammatical, reassuring vernacular–\"ain’t\nthat queer!  Say, I’m no detective.  Gee, kid, did you think I was?\nSay, listen to this!  I cracked old Isaac’s safe half an hour ago–\nand I guess there won’t be any idea going around that you got the\nmoney and I pulled a lemon.  Say, I ain’t superstitious, but it\nlooks like luck meant you to have another chance, don’t it?”",
        "The hat dropped from Hagan’s hands to the floor, and he swayed a\nlittle.",
        "“You–you ain’t a dick!” he stammered.  “Then how’d you know about\nme and my name when you found the safe empty?  Who told you?”",
        "A wry grimace spread suddenly over Jimmie Dale’s face beneath the\nmask, and he swallowed hard.  Jimmie Dale would have given a good\ndeal to have been able to answer that question himself.",
        "“Oh, that!” said Jimmie Dale.  “That’s easy–I knew you worked\nthere.  Say, it’s the limit, ain’t it?  Talk about your luck being\nin, why all you’ve got to do is to sit tight and keep your mouth\nshut, and you’re safe as a church.  Only say, what are you going to\ndo about the money, now you’ve got a four months’ start and are kind\nof landed on your feet?",
        "“Do?” said the boy.  “I’ll pay it back, little by little.  I meant\nto.  I ain’t no–”  He stopped abruptly.",
        "“Crook,” supplied Jimmie Dale pleasantly.  “Spit it right out, kid;\nyou won’t hurt my feelings none.  Well, I’ll tell you–you’re\ntalking the way I like to hear you–you pay that back, slide it in\nwithout his knowing it, a bit at a time, whenever you can, and\nyou’ll never hear a yip out of me; but if you don’t, why it kind of\nlooks as though I have a right to come down your street and get my\nshare or know the reason why–eh?”",
        "“Then you never get any share,” said Hagan, with a catch in his\nvoice.  “I pay it back as fast as I can.”",
        "“Sure,” said Jimmie Dale.  “That’s right–that’s what I said.  Well,\nso long–Hagan.”  And Jimmie Dale had opened the door and slipped\noutside.",
        "An hour later, in his dressing room in his house on Riverside Drive,\nJimmie Dale was removing his coat as the telephone, a hand\ninstrument on the table, rang.  Jimmie Dale glanced at it–and\nleisurely proceeded to remove his vest.  Again the telephone rang.\nJimmie Dale took off his curious, pocketed leather belt–as the\ntelephone repeated its summons.  He picked out the little drill he\nhad used a short while before, and inspected it critically–feeling\nits point with his thumb, as one might feel a razor’s blade.  Again\nthe telephone rang insistently.  He reached languidly for the\nreceiver, took it off its hook, and held it to his ear.",
        "“Hello!” said Jimmie Dale, with a sleepy yawn.  “Hello!  Hello!  Why\nthe deuce don’t you yank a man out of bed at two o’clock in the\nmorning and have done with it, and–eh?  Oh, that you, Carruthers?”",
        "“Yes,” came Carruthers’ voice excitedly.  “Jimmie, listen–listen!\nThe Gray Seal’s come to life!  He’s just pulled a break on West\nBroadway!”",
        "“Good Lord!” gasped Jimmie Dale.  “You don’t say!”",
        "The most puzzling bewildering, delightful crook in the annals of\ncrime,” Herman Carruthers, the editor of the MORNING NEWS-ARGUS, had\ncalled the Gray Seal; and Jimmie Dale smiled a little grimly now as\nhe recalled the occasion of a week ago at the St. James Club over\ntheir after-dinner coffee.  That was before his second debut, with\nIsaac Brolsky’s poverty-stricken premises over on West Broadway as a\nsetting for the break.",
        "SHE had written: “Things are a little too warm, aren’t they, Jimmie?\nLet’s let them cool for a year.”  Well, they had cooled for a year,\nand Carruthers as a result had been complacently satisfied in his\nown mind that the Gray Seal was dead–until that break at Isaac\nBrolsky’s over on West Broadway!",
        "Jimmie Dale’s smile was tinged with whimsicality now.  The only\neffect of the year’s inaction had been to usher in his renewed\nactivity with a furor compared to which all that had gone before was\ninsignificant.  Where the newspapers had been maudlin, they now\nraved–raved in editorials and raved in headlines.  It was an\nimpossible, untenable, unbelievable condition of affairs that this\nGray Seal, for all his incomparable cleverness, should flaunt his\ncrimes in the faces of the citizens of New York.  One could actually\nsee the editors writhing in their swivel chairs as their fiery\ndenunciations dripped from their pens!  What was the matter with the\npolice?  Were the police children; or, worse still, imbeciles–or,\nstill worse again, was there some one “higher up” who was profiting\nby this rogue’s work?  New York would not stand for it–New York\nwould most decidedly not–and the sooner the police realised that\nfact the better!  If the police were helpless, or tools, the\ncitizens of New York were not, and it was time the citizens were\nthoroughly aroused.",
        "There was a way, too, to arouse the citizens, that was both good\nbusiness from the newspaper standpoint, and efficacious as a method.\nCarruthers, of the MORNING NEWS-ARGUS, had initiated it.  The\nMORNING NEWS-ARGUS offered twenty-five thousand dollars’ reward for\nthe capture of the Gray Seal!  Other papers immediately followed\nsuit in varying amounts.  The authorities, State and municipal,\ngoaded to desperation, did likewise, and the five million men,\nwomen, and children of New York were automatically metamorphosed\ninto embryonic sleuths.  New York was aroused.",
        "Jimmie Dale, alias the Gray Seal, member of the ultra-exclusive St.\nJames Club, the latter fact sufficient in itself to guarantee his\nsocial standing, graduate of Harvard, inheritor of his deceased\nfather’s immense wealth amassed in the manufacture of burglar-proof\nsafes, some of the most ingenious patents on which were due to\nJimmie Dale himself, figured with a pencil on the margin of the\nnewspaper he had been reading, using the arm of the big, luxurious,\nleather-upholstered lounging chair as a support for the paper.  The\nresult of his calculations was eighty-five thousand dollars.",
        "He brushed the paper onto the Turkish rug, dove into the pocket of\nhis dinner jacket for his cigarettes, and began to smoke as his eyes\nstrayed around the room, his own particular den in his fashionable\nRiverside Drive residence.",
        "Eighty-five thousand dollars’ reward!  Jimmie Dale blew meditative\nrings of cigarette smoke at the fireplace.  What would she say to\nthat?  Would she decide it was “too hot” again, and call it off?  It\nadded quite a little hazard to the game–QUITE a little!  If he only\nknew who “she” was!  It was a strange partnership–the strangest\npartnership that had ever existed between two human beings.",
        "He turned a little in his chair as a step sounded in the hallway\nwithout–that is, Jimmie Dale caught the sound, muffled though it\nwas by the heavy carpet.  Came then a knock upon the door.",
        "“Come in,” invited Jimmie Dale.",
        "It was old Jason, the butler.  The old man was visibly excited, as\nhe extended a silver tray on which lay a letter.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s hand reached quickly out, the long, slim tapering\nfingers closed upon the envelope–but his eyes were on Jason\nsignificantly, questioningly.",
        "“Yes, Master Jim,” said the old man, “I recognised it on the\ninstant, sir.  After what you said, sir, last week, honouring me, I\nmight say, to a certain extent with your confidence, though I’m sure\nI don’t know what it all means, I–”",
        "“Who brought it this time, Jason?” inquired Jimmie Dale quietly.",
        "“Not the young person, begging your pardon, not the young lady, sir.\nA shuffer in a big automobile.  ’Your master at once,’ he says, and\nshoves the letter into my hand, and was off.”",
        "“Very good, Jason,” said Jimmie Dale.  “You may go.”",
        "The door closed.  Yes, it was from HER–it was the same texture of\npaper, there was the same rare, haunting fragrance clinging to it.",
        "He tore the envelope open, and extracted a folded sheet of paper.\nWhat was it this time?  To call the partnership off again until the\npresent furor should have subsided once more–or the skilfully\nsketched outline of a new adventure?  Which?  He glanced at the few\nlines written on the sheet, and lunged forward from his chair to his\nfeet.  It was neither one nor the other.  It was–",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face was set, and an angry red surge swept his cheeks.\nHis lips moved, muttering audibly fragments of the letter, as he\nstared at it.",
        "“–incredible that you–a heinous thing–act instantly–this is\nruin–”",
        "For an instant–a rare occurrence in Jimmie Dale’s life–he stood\nlike a man stricken, still staring at the sheet in his hand.  Then\nmechanically his fingers tore the paper into little pieces, and the\nlittle pieces into tiny shreds.  Anger fled, and a sickening sense\nof impotent dismay took its place; the red left his cheecks, and in\nits stead a grayness came.",
        "“Act instantly!”  The words seemed to leap at him, drum at his ears\nwith constant repetition.  Act instantly!  But how?  How?  Then his\nbrain–that keen, clear, master brain–sprang from stunned inaction\ninto virility again.  Of course–Carruthers!  It was in Carruthers’\nline.",
        "He stepped to the desk–and paused with his hand extended to pick up\nthe telephone.  How explain to Carruthers that he, Jimmie Dale,\nalready knew what Carruthers might not yet have heard of, even\nthough Carruthers would naturally be among the first to be in touch\nwith such affairs!  No; that would never do.  Better get there\nhimself at once and trust to–",
        "The telephone rang.",
        "Jimmie Dale waited until it rang again, then he lifted the receiver\nfrom the hook.",
        "“Hello?” he said.",
        "“Hello!  Hello!  Jimmie!” came a voice.  “This is Carruthers.  That\nyou, Jimmie?”",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale and sat down limply in the desk chair.",
        "“It’s the Gray Seal again.  I promised you I’d let you in on the\nground floor next time anything happened, so come on down here quick\nif you want to see some of his work at firsthand.”",
        "Jimmie Dale flirted a bead of sweat from his forehead.",
        "“Carruthers,” said Jimmie languidly, “you newspaper chaps make me\ntired with your Gray Seal.  I’m just going to bed.”",
        "“Bed nothing!” spluttered Carruthers, from the other end of the\nwire.  “Come down, I tell you.  It’s worth your while–half the\npopulation of New York would give the toes off their feet for the\nchance.  Come down, you blast idiot!  The Gray Seal has gone the\nlimit this time–it’s MURDER.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face was haggard.",
        "“Oh!” he said peevishly.  “Sounds interesting.  Where are you?  I\nguess maybe I’ll jog along.”",
        "“I should think you would!” snapped Carruthers.  “You know the\nPalace on the Bowery?  Yes?  Well, meet me on the corner there as\nsoon as you can.  Hustle!  Good–”",
        "“Oh, I say, Carruthers!” interposed Jimmie Dale.",
        "“Yes?” demanded Carruthers.",
        "“Thanks awfully for letting me know, old man.”",
        "“Don’t mention it!” returned Carruthers sarcastically.  “You always\nwere a grateful beast, Jimmie.  Hurry up!”",
        "Jimmie Dale hung up the receiver of the city ’phone, and took down\nthe receiver of another, a private-house installation, and rang\ntwice for the garage.",
        "“The light car at once, Benson,” he ordered curtly.  “At once!”",
        "Jimmie Dale worked quickly then.  In his dressing room, he changed\nfrom dinner clothes to tweeds; spent a second or so over the\ncontents of a locked drawer in the dresser, from which he selected a\nvery small but serviceable automatic, and a very small but highly\npowerful magnifying glass whose combination of little round lenses\nworked on a pivot, and, closed over one another, were of about the\ncompass of a quarter of a dollar.",
        "In three minutes he was outside the house and stepping into the car,\njust as it drew up at the curb.",
        "“Benson,” he said tersely to his chauffeur, “drop me one block this\nside of the Palace on the Bowery–and forget there was ever a speed\nlaw enacted.  Understand?”",
        "“Very good, sir,” said Benson, touching his cap.  “I’ll do my best,\nsir.”",
        "Jimmie Dale, in the tonneau, stretched out his legs under the front\nseat, and dug his hands into his pockets–and inside the pockets his\nhands were clenched and knotted fists.",
        "Murder!  At times it had occurred to him that there was a\npossibility that some crook of the underworld would attempt to cover\nhis tracks and take refuge from pursuit by foisting himself on the\nauthorities as the Gray Seal.  That was a possibility, a risk always\nto be run.  But that MURDER should be laid to the Gray Seal’s door!\nAnger, merciless and unrestrained, surged over Jimmie Dale.",
        "There was peril here, live and imminent.  Suppose that some day he\nshould be caught in some little affair, recognised and identified as\nthe Gray Seal, there would be the charge of murder hanging over him–\nand the electric chair to face!",
        "But the peril was not the only thing.  Even worse to Jimmie Dale’s\nartistic and sensitive temperament was the vilification, the holding\nup to loathing, contumely, and abhorrence of the name, the stainless\nname, of the Gray Seal.  It WAS stainless!  He had guarded it\njealously–as a man guards the woman’s name he loves.",
        "Affairs that had mystified and driven the police distracted with\nimpotence there had been, many of them; and on the face of them–\ncrimes.  But no act ever committed had been in reality a crime–\nnone without the highest of motives, the righting of some outrageous\nwrong, the protection of some poor stumbling fellow human.",
        "That had been his partnership with her.  How, by what amazing means,\nby what power that smacked almost of the miraculous she came in\ntouch with all these things and supplied him with the data on which\nto work he did not know–only that, thanks to her, there were\nhappier hearts and happier homes since the Gray Seal had begun to\nwork.  “Dear Philanthropic Crook,” she often called him in her\nletters.  And now–it was MURDER!",
        "Take Carruthers, for instance.  For years, as a reporter before he\nhad risen to the editorial desk, he had been one of the keenest on\nthe scent of the Gray Seal, but always for the sake of the game–\nalways filled with admiration, as he said himself, for the daring,\nthe originality of the most puzzling, bewildering, delightful crook\nin the annals of crime.  Carruthers was but an example.  Carruthers\nnow would hunt the Gray Seal like a mad dog.  The Gray Seal, to\nCarruthers and every one else, would be the vilest name in the land–\na synonym for murder.",
        "On the car flew–and upon Jimmie Dale’s face, as though chiselled in\nmarble, was a look that was not good to see.  And a mirthless smile\nset, frozen, on his lips.",
        "“I’ll get the man that did this,” gritted Jimmie Dale between his\nteeth.  “I’ll GET him!  And, when I get him, I’ll wring a confession\nfrom him if I have to swing for it!”",
        "The car swept from Broadway into Astor Place, on down the Bowery,\nand presently stopped.",
        "Jimmie Dale stepped out.  “I shall not want you any more, Benson,\"\nhe said.  “You may return home.”",
        "Jimmie Dale started down the block–a nonchalant Jimmie Dale now, if\nanything, bored a little.  Near the corner, a figure, back turned,\nwas lounging at the edge of the sidewalk.  Jimmie Dale touched the\nman on the arm.",
        "“Hello, Carruthers!” he drawled.",
        "“Ah, Jimmie!” Carruthers turned with an excited smile.  “That’s the\nboy!  You’ve made mighty quick time.”",
        "“Well, you told me to hurry,” grumbled Jimmie Dale.  “I’m doing my\nbest to please you to-night.  Came down in my car, and got summoned\nfor three fines to-morrow.”",
        "Carruthers laughed.  “Come on,” he said; and, linking his arm in\nJimmie Dale’s, turned the corner, and headed west along the cross\nstreet.  “This is going to make a noise,” he continued, a grim note\ncreeping into his voice.  “The biggest noise the city has ever\nheard.  I take back all I said about the Gray Seal.  I’d always\npictured his cleverness as being inseparable with at least a decent\nsort of man, even if he was a rogue and a criminal, but I’m through\nwith that.  He’s a rotter and a hound of the rankest sort!  I didn’t\nthink there was anything more vulgar or brutal than murder, but he’s\nshown me that there is.  A guttersnipe’s got more decency!  To\nmurder a man and then boastfully label the corpse is–”",
        "“Say, Carruthers,” said Jimmie Dale plaintively, suddenly hanging\nback, “I say, you know, it’s–it’s all right for you to mess up in\nthis sort of thing, it’s your beastly business, and I’m awfully\ndamned thankful to you for giving me a look-in, but isn’t it–er–\nrather INFRA DIG for me?  A bit morbid, you know, and all that sort\nof thing.  I’d never hear the end of it at the club–you know what\nthe St. James is.  Couldn’t I be Merideth Stanley Annstruther, or\nsomething like that, one of your new reporters, or something like\nthat, you know?”",
        "Carruthers chuckled.  “Sure, Jimmie,” he said.  “You’re the latest\naddition to the staff of the NEWS-ARGUS.  Don’t worry; the\nincomparable Jimmie Dale won’t figure publicly in this.”",
        "“It’s awfully good of you,” said Jimmie gratefully.  “I have to have\na notebook or something, don’t I?”",
        "Carruthers, from his pocket, handed him one.  “Thanks,” said Jimmie\nDale.",
        "A little way ahead, a crowd had collected on the sidewalk before a\ndoorway, and Carruthers pointed with a jerk of his hand.",
        "“It’s in Moriarty’s place–a gambling hell,” he explained.  “I\nhaven’t got the story myself yet, though I’ve been inside, and had a\nlook around.  Inspector Clayton discovered the crime, and reported\nit at headquarters.  I was at my desk in the office when the news\ncame, and, as you know the interest I’ve taken in the Gray Seal, I\ndecided to ’cover’ it myself.  When I got here, Clayton hadn’t\nreturned from headquarters, so, as you seemed so keenly interested\nlast week, I telephoned you.  If Clayton’s back now we’ll get the\ndetails.  Clayton’s a good fellow with the ’press,’ and he won’t\nhold anything out on us.  Now, here we are.  Keep close to me, and\nI’ll pass you in.”",
        "They shouldered through the crowd and up to an officer at the door.\nThe officer nodded, stepped aside, and Carruthers, with Jimmie Dale\nfollowing, entered the house.",
        "They climbed one flight, and then another.  The card-rooms, the\nfaro, stud, and roulette layouts were deserted, save for policemen\nhere and there on guard.  Carruthers led the way to a room at the\nback of the hall, whose door was open and from which issued a hubbub\nof voices–one voice rose above the others, heavy and gratingly\ncomplacent.",
        "“Clayton’s back,” observed Carruthers.",
        "They stepped over the threshold, and the heavy voice greeted them.",
        "“Ah, here’s Carruthers now!  H’are you, Carruthers?  They told me\nyou’d been here, and were coming back, so I’ve been keeping the boys\nwaiting before handing out the dope.  You’ve had a look at that–\neh?”  He flung out a fat hand toward the bed.",
        "The voices rose again, all directed at Carruthers now.",
        "“Bubble’s burst, eh, Carruthers?  What about the ’Prince of Crooks’?\nArtistry in crime, wasn’t it, you said?”  They were quoting from his\neditorials of bygone days, a half dozen reporters of rival papers,\ngrinning and joshing him good-naturedly, seemingly quite unaffected\nby what lay within arm’s reach of them upon the bed.",
        "Carruthers smiled a little wryly, shrugged his shoulders–and\npresented Jimmie Dale to Inspector Clayton.",
        "“Mr. Matthewson, a new man of ours–inspector.”",
        "“Glad to know you, Mr. Matthewson,” said the inspector.",
        "Jimmie Dale found his hand grasped by another that was flabby and\nunpleasantly moist; and found himself looking into a face that was\nred, with heavy rolls of unhealthy fat terminating in a double chin\nand a thick, apoplectic neck–a huge, round face, with rat’s eyes.",
        "Clayton dropped Jimmie Dale’s hand, and waved his own in the air.\nJimmie Dale remained modestly on the outside of the circle as the\nreporters gathered around the police inspector.",
        "“Now, then,” said Clayton coarsely, “the guy that’s croaked there is\nMetzer, Jake Metzer.  Get that?”",
        "Jimmie Dale, scribbling hurriedly in his notebook like all the rest,\nturned a little toward the bed, and his lower jaw crept out the\nfraction of an inch.  Both gas jets in the room were turned on full,\ngiving ample light.  A man fully dressed, a man of perhaps forty,\nlay upon his back on the bed, one arm outflung across the bedspread,\nthe other dangling, with fingers just touching the floor, the head\nat an angle and off the pillow.  It was as though he had been\ncarried to the bed and flung upon it after the deed had been\ncommitted.  Jimmie Dale’s eyes shifted and swept the room.  Yes,\neverything was in disorder, as though there had been a struggle–a\nchair upturned, a table canted against the wall, broken pieces of\ncrockery from the washstand on the carpet, and–",
        "“Metzer was a stool pigeon, see?” went on Clayton, “and he lived\nhere.  Moriarty wasn’t on to him.  Metzer stood in thick with a\nwider circle of crooks than any other snitch in New York.”",
        "Jimmie Dale, still scribbling as Clayton talked, stepped to the bed\nand leaned over the murdered man.  The murder had been done with a\nblackjack evidently–a couple of blows.  The left side of the temple\nwas crushed in.  Right in the middle of the forehead, pasted there,\na gray-colored, diamond shaped paper seal flaunted itself–the\ndevice of the Gray Seal.  In Jimmie Dale’ hand, hidden as he turned\nhis back, the tiny combination of powerful lenses was focused on the\nseal.",
        "Clayton guffawed.  “That’s right!” he called out.  “Take a good\nlook.  That’s a bright young man you’ve got, Carruthers.”",
        "Jimmie Dale looked up a little sheepishly–and got a grin from the\nassembled reporters, and a scowl from Carruthers.",
        "Now, then,” continued Clayton, “here’s the facts–as much of ’em as\nI can let you boys print at present.  You know I’m stretching a\npoint to let you in here–don’t forget that when you come to write\nup the case–honour where’s honour’s due, you know.  Well, me and\nMetzer there was getting ready to close down on a big piece of game,\nand I was over here in this room talking to him about it early this\nafternoon.  We had it framed to get our man to-night–see?  I left\nMetzer, say, about three o’clock, and he was to show up over at\nheadquarters with another little bit of evidence we wanted at eight\no’clock to-night.”",
        "Jimmie Dale was listening–to every word.  But he stooped now again\nover the murdered man’s head deliberately, though he felt the\ninspector’s rat’s eyes upon him–stooped, and, with his finger nail,\nlifted back the right-hand point of the diamond-shaped seal where it\nbordered a faint thread of blood on the man’s forehead.",
        "There was a bull-like roar from the inspector, and he burst through\nthe ring of reporters, and grabbed Jimmie Dale by the shoulder.",
        "“Here you, what in hell are you doing!” he spluttered angrily.",
        "Embarrassed and confused, Jimmie Dale drew back, glanced around, and\nsmiled again a little sheepishly as his eyes rested on the red-\nflushed jowl of the inspector.",
        "“I–I wanted to see how it was stuck on,” he explained inanely.",
        "“Stuck on!” bellowed Clayton.  “I’ll show you how it’s STUCK on, if\nyou monkey around here!  Don’t you know any better than that!  Where\nwere you dragged up anyway?  The coroner hasn’t been here yet.\nYou’re a hot cub of a reporter, you are!”  He turned to Carruthers.\n\"Y’ought to get out printed instructions for ’em before you turn ’em\nloose!” he snapped.",
        "Carruthers’ face was red with mortification.  There was a grin,\nexpanded, on the faces of the others.",
        "“Stand away from that bed!” roared Clayton at Jimmie Dale.  “And if\nyou go near it again, I’ll throw you out of here bodily!”",
        "Jimmie Dale edged away, and, eyes lowered, fumbled nervously with\nthe leaves of his notebook.",
        "Clayton grunted, glared at Jimmie Dale for an instant viciously–and\nresumed his story.",
        "“I was saying,” he said, “that Metzer was to come to headquarters at\neight o’clock this evening.  Well, he didn’t show up.  That looked\nqueer.  It was mighty important business.  We was after one of the\nbiggest hauls we’d ever pulled off.  I waited till nine o’clock, an\nhour ago, and I was getting nervous.  Then I started over here to\nfind out what was the matter.  When I got here I asked Moriarty if\nhe’d seen Metzer.  Moriarty said he hadn’t since I was here before.\nHe was a little suspicious that I had something on Metzer–see?\nWell, by pumping Moriarty, he admitted that Metzer had had a visitor\nabout an hour after I left.”",
        "“Who was it?  Know what his name is, inspector?” asked one of the\nreporters quickly.",
        "Inspector Clayton winked heavily.  “Don’t be greedy boys,” he\ngrinned.",
        "“You mean you’ve got him?” burst out another one of the men\nexcitedly.",
        "“Sure!  Sure, I’ve got him.” Inspector Clayton waved his fat hand\nairily.  “Or I will have before morning–but I ain’t saying anything\nmore till it’s over.”  He smiled significantly.  “Well, that’s about\nall.  You’ve got the details right around you.  I left Moriarty\ndownstairs and came up here, and found just what you see–Metzer\nlaying on the bed there, and the gray seal stuck on his forehead–\nand\"–he ended abruptly–\"I’ll have the Gray Seal himself behind the\nbars by morning.”",
        "A chorus of ejaculations rose from the reporters, while their\npencils worked furiously.",
        "Then Jimmie Dale appeared to have an inspiration.  Jimmie Dale\nturned a leaf in his notebook and began to sketch rapidly, cocking\nhis head now on one side now on the other.  With a few deft strokes\nhe had outlined the figure of Inspector Clayton.  The reporter\nbeside Jimmie Dale leaned over to inspect the work, and another did\nlikewise.  Jimmie Dale drew in Clayton’s face most excellently, if\nsomewhat flatteringly; and then, with a little flourish of pride,\nwrote under the drawing: “The Man Who Captured the Gray Seal.”",
        "“That’s a cracking good sketch!” pronounced the reporter at his\nside.  “Let the inspector see it.”",
        "“What is it?” demanded Clayton, scowling.",
        "Jimmie Dale handed him the notebook modestly.",
        "Inspector Clayton took it, looked at it, looked at Jimmie Dale; then\nhis scowl relaxed into a self-sufficient and pleased smile, and he\ngrunted approvingly.",
        "“That’s the stuff to put over,” he said.  “Mabbe you’re not much of\na reporter, but you can draw.  Y’re all right, sport–y’re all\nright.  Forget what I said to you a while ago.”",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled too–deprecatingly.  And put the notebook in his\npocket.",
        "An officer entered the room hurriedly, and, drawing Clayton aside,\nspoke in an undertone.  A triumphant and malicious grin settled on\nClayton’s features, and he started with a rush for the door.",
        "“Come around to headquarters in two hours, boys,” he called as he\nwent out, “and I’ll have something more for you.”",
        "The room cleared, the reporters tumbling downstairs to make for the\nnearest telephones to get their “copy” into their respective\noffices.",
        "On the street, a few doors up from the house where they were free\nfrom the crowd, Carruthers halted Jimmie Dale.",
        "“Jimmie,” he said reproachfully, “you certainly made a mark of us\nboth.  There wasn’t any need to play the ’cub’ so egregiously.\nHowever, I’ll forgive you for the sake of the sketch–hand it over,\nJimmie; I’m going to reproduce it in the first edition.”",
        "“It wasn’t drawn for reproduction, Carruthers–at least not yet,\"\nsaid Jimmie Dale quietly.",
        "Carruthers stared at him.  “Eh?” he asked blankly.",
        "“I’ve taken a dislike to Clayton,” said Jimmie Dale whimsically.\n\"He’s too patently after free advertising, and I’m not going to help\nalong his boost.  You can’t have it, old man, so let’s think about\nsomething else.  What’ll they do with that bit of paper that’s on\nthe poor devil’s forehead up there, for instance.”",
        "“Say,” said Carruthers, “does it strike you that you’re acting\nqueer?  You haven’t been drinking, have you, Jimmie?”",
        "“What’ll they do with it?” persisted Jimmie Dale.",
        "“Well,” said Carruthers, smiling a little tolerantly, “they’ll\nphotograph it and enlarge the photograph, and label it ’Exhibit A’\nor ’Exhibit B’ or something like that–and file it away in the\narchives with the fifty or more just like it that are already in\ntheir collection.”",
        "“That’s what I thought,” observed Jimmie Dale.  He took Carruthers\nby the lapel of the coat.  “I’d like a photograph of that.  I’d like\nit so much that I’ve got to have it.  Know the chap that does that\nwork for the police?”",
        "“Yes,” admitted Carruthers.",
        "“Very good!” said Jimmie Dale crisply, “Get an extra print of the\nenlargement from him then–for a consideration–whatever he asks–\nI’ll pay for it.”",
        "“But what for?” demanded Carruthers.  “I don’t understand.”",
        "“Because,” said Jimmie Dale very seriously, “put it down to\nimagination or whatever you like, I think I smell something fishy\nhere.”",
        "“You WHAT!” exclaimed Carruthers in amazement.  “You’re not joking,\nare you, Jimmie?”",
        "Jimmie Dale laughed shortly.  “It’s so far from a joke,” he said, in\na low tone, “that I want your word you’ll get that photograph into\nmy hands by to-morrow afternoon, no matter what transpires in the\nmeantime.  And look here, Carruthers, don’t think I’m playing the\nsilly thickhead, and trying to mystify you.  I’m no detective or\nanything like that.  I’ve just got an idea that apparently hasn’t\noccurred to any one else–and, of course, I may be all wrong.  If I\nam, I’m not going to say a word even to you, because it wouldn’t be\nplaying fair with some one else; if I’m right the MORNING NEWS-ARGUS\ngets the biggest scoop of the century.  Will you go in on that\nbasis?”",
        "Carruthers put out his hand impulsively.  “If you’re in earnest,\nJimmie–you bet!”",
        "“Good!” returned Jimmie Dale.  “The photograph by to-morrow\nafternoon then.  And now–”",
        "“And now,” said Caruthers, “I’ve got to hurry over to the office and\nget a write-up man at work.  Will you come along, or meet me at\nheadquarters later?  Clayton said in two hours he’d–”",
        "“Neither,” said Jimmie Dale.  “I’m not interested in headquarters.\nI’m going home.”",
        "“Well, all right then,” Carruthers returned.  “You can bank on me\nfor to-morrow.  Good-night, Jimmie.”",
        "“Good-night, old man,” said Jimmie Dale, and, turning, walked\nbriskly toward the Bowery.",
        "But Jimmie Dale did not go home.  He walked down the Bowery for\nthree blocks, crossed to the east side, and turned down a cross\nstreet.  Two blocks more he walked in this direction, and halfway\ndown the next.  Here he paused an instant–the street was dimly\nlighted, almost dark, deserted.  Jimmie Dale edged close to the\nhouses until his shadow blended with the shadows of the walls–and\nslipped suddenly into a pitch-black areaway.",
        "He opened a door, stepped into an unlighted hallway where the air\nwas close and evil smelling, mounted a stairway, and halted before\nanother door on the first landing.  There was the low clicking of a\nlock, three times repeated, and he entered a room, closing and\nfastening the door behind him.",
        "Jimmie Dale called it his “Sanctuary.”  In one of the worst\nneighbourhoods of New York, where no questions were asked as long as\nthe rent was paid, it had the further advantage of three separate\nexits–one by the areaway where he had entered; one from the street\nitself; and another through a back yard with an entry into a saloon\nthat fronted on the next street.  It was not often that Jimmie Dale\nused his Sanctuary, but there had been times when it was no more nor\nless than exactly what he called it–a sanctuary!",
        "He stepped to the window, assured himself that the shade was down–\nand lighted the gas, blinking a little as the yellow flame\nilluminated the room.",
        "It was a rough place, dirty, uninviting; a bedroom, furnished in the\nmost scanty fashion.  Neither, apparently, was there anything\nsuspicious about it to reward one curious enough to break in during\nthe owner’s absence–some rather disreputable clothes hanging on the\nwall, and flung untidily across the bed–that was all.",
        "Alone now, Jimmie Dale’s face was strained and anxious and,\noccasionally, as he undressed himself, his hands clenched until his\nknuckles grew white.  The gray seal on the murdered man’s forehead\nwas a GENUINE GRAY SEAL–one of Jimmie Dale’s own.  There was no\ndoubt of that–he had satisfied himself on that point.",
        "Where had it come from?  How had it been obtained?  Jimmie Dale\ncarefully placed the clothes he had taken off under the mattress,\npulled a disreputable collarless flannel shirt over his head, and\npulled on a disreputable pair of boots.  There were only two sources\nof supply.  His own–and the collection that the police had made,\nwhich Carruthers had referred to.",
        "Jimmie Dale lifted a corner of the oilcloth in a corner of the room,\nlifted a piece of the flooring, lifted out a little box which he\nplaced upon the rickety table, and sat down before a cracked mirror.\nWho was it that would have access to the gray seals in the\npossession of the police, since, obviously, it was one of those that\nwas on the dead man’s forehead?  The answer came quick enough–came\nwith the sudden out-thrust of Jimmie Dale’s lower jaw.  ONE OF THE\nPOLICE THEMSELVES–no one else.  Clayton’s heavy, cunning face,\nClayton’s shifty eyes, Clayton’s sudden rush when he had touched the\ndead man’s forehead, pictured themselves in a red flash of fury\nbefore Jimmie Dale.  There was no mask now, no facetiousness, no\nacted part–only a merciless rage, and the muscles of Jimmie Dale’s\nface quivered and twitched.  MURDER, foisted, shifted upon another,\nupon the Gray Seal–making of that name a calumny–ruining forever\nthe work that she and he might do!",
        "And then Jimmie Dale smiled mirthlessly, with thinning lips.  The\nbox before him was open.  His fingers worked quickly–a little wax\nbehind the ears, in the nostrils, under the upper lip, deftly\nplaced-hands, wrists, neck, throat, and face received their quota of\nstain, applied with an artist’s touch–and then the spruce, muscular\nJimmie Dale, transformed into a slouching, vicious-featured denizen\nof the underworld, replaced the box under the flooring, pulled a\nslouch hat over his eyes, extinguished the gas, and went out.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s range of acquaintanceship was wide–from the upper\nstrata of the St. James Club to the elite of New York’s gangland.\nAnd, adored by the one, he was trusted implicitly by the other–not\nunderstood, perhaps, by the latter, for he had never allied himself\nwith any of their nefarious schemes, but trusted implicitly through\nlong years of personal contact.  It had stood Jimmie Dale in good\nstead before, this association, where, in a sort of strange,\ncarefully guarded exchange, the news of the underworld was common\nproperty to those without the law.  To New York in its millions, the\nmurder of Metzer, the stool pigeon, would be unknown until the city\nrose in the morning to read the sensational details over the\nbreakfast table; here, it would already be the topic of whispered\nconversations, here it had probably been known long before the\npolice had discovered the crime.  Especially would it be expected to\nbe known to Pete Lazanis, commonly called the Runt, who was a power\nbelow the dead line and, more pertinent still, one in whose\nconfidence Jimmie Dale had rejoiced for years.",
        "Jimmie Dale, as Larry the Bat–a euphonious “monaker” bestowed\npossibly because this particular world knew him only by night–began\na search for the Runt.  From one resort to another he hurried,\ntalking in the accepted style through one corner of his mouth to\nhard-visaged individuals behind dirty, reeking bars that were reared\non equally dirty and foul-smelling sawdust-strewn floors; visiting\ndance halls, secretive back rooms, and certain Chinese pipe joints.",
        "But the Runt was decidedly elusive.  There had been no news of him,\nno one had seen him–and this after fully an hour had passed since\nJimmie Dale had left Carruthers in front of Moriarty’s.  The\npossibilities however were still legion–numbered only by the\nnumberless dives and dens sheltered by that quarter of the city.",
        "Jimmie Dale turned into Chatham Square, heading for the Pagoda Dance\nHall.  A man loitering at the curb shot a swift, searching glance at\nhim as he slouched by.  Jimmie Dale paused in the doorway of the\nPagoda and looked up and down the street.  The man he had passed had\ndrawn a little closer; another man in an apparently aimless fashion\nlounged a few yards away.",
        "“Something up,” muttered Jimmie Dale to himself.  “Lansing, of\nheadquarters, and the other looks like Milrae.”",
        "Jimmie Dale pushed in through the door of the Pagoda.  A bedlam of\nnoise surged out at him–a tin-pan piano and a mandolin were going\nfuriously from a little raised platform at the rear; in the centre\nof the room a dozen couples were in the throes of the tango and the\nbunny-hug; around the sides, at little tables, men and women laughed\nand applauded and thumped time on the tabletops with their beer\nmugs; while waiters, with beer-stained aprons and unshaven faces,\njuggled marvelous handfuls of glasses and mugs from the bar beside\nthe platform to the patrons at the tables.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes swept the room in a swift, comprehensive glance,\nfixed on a little fellow, loudly dressed, who shared a table halfway\ndown the room with a woman in a picture hat, and a smile of relief\ntouched his lips.  The Runt at last!",
        "He walked down the room, caught the Runt’s eyes significantly as he\npassed the table, kept on to a door between the platform and the\nbar, opened it, and went out into a lighted hallway, at one end of\nwhich a door opened onto the street, and at the other a stairway led\nabove.",
        "The Runt joined him.  “Wot’s de row, Larry?” inquired the Runt.",
        "“Nuthin’ much,” said Jimmie Dale.  “Only I t’ought I’d let youse\nknow.  I was passin’ Moriarty’s an’ got de tip.  Say, some guy’s\ncroaked Jake Metzer dere.”",
        "“Aw, ferget it!” observed the Runt airily.  “Dat’s stale.  Was wise\nto dat hours ago.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face fell.  “But I just come from dere,” he insisted;\n\"an’ de harness bulls only just found it out.”",
        "“Mabbe,” grunted the Runt.  “But Metzer got his early in de\nafternoon–see?”",
        "Jimmie Dale looked quickly around him–and then leaned toward the\nRunt.",
        "“Wot’s de lay, Runt?” he whispered.",
        "The Runt pulled down one eyelid, and, with his knowing grin, the\ncigarette, clinging to his upper lip, sagged down in the opposite\ncorner of his mouth.",
        "Jimmie Dale grinned, too–in a flash inspiration had come to Jimmie\nDale.",
        "“Say, Runt\"–he jerked his head toward the street door–\"wot’s de\nfly cops doin’ out dere?”",
        "The grin vanished from the Runt’s lips.  He stared for a second\nwildly at Jimmie Dale, and then clutched at Jimmie Dale’s arm.",
        "“De WOT?” he said hoarsely.",
        "“De fly cops,” Jimmie Dale repeated in well-simulated surprise.\n\"Dey was dere when I come in–Lansing an’ Milrae, an–”",
        "The Runt shot a hurried glance at the stairway, and licked his lips\nas though they had gone suddenly dry.",
        "“My Gawd, I–”  He gasped, and shrank hastily back against the wall\nbeside Jimmie Dale.",
        "The door from the street had opened noiselessly, instantly.  Black\nforms bulked there–then a rush of feet–and at the head of half a\ndozen men, the face of Inspector Clayton loomed up before Jimmie\nDale.  There was a second’s pause in the rush; and, in the pause,\nClayton’s voice, in a vicious undertone:",
        "“You two ginks open your traps, and I’ll run you both in!”",
        "And then the rush passed, and swept on up the stairs.",
        "Jimmie Dale looked at the Runt.  The cigarette dangled limply; the\nRunt’s eyes were like a hunted beast’s.",
        "“Dey got him!” he mumbled.  “It’s Stace–Stace Morse.  He come to me\nafter croakin’ Metzer, an’ he’s been hidin’ up dere all afternoon.",
        "Stace Morse–known in gangland as a man with every crime in the\ncalendar to his credit, and prominent because of it!  Something\nseemed to go suddenly queer inside of Jimmie Dale.  Stace Morse!\nWas he wrong, after all?  Jimmie Dale drew closer to the Runt.",
        "“Yer givin’ me a steer, ain’t youse?”  He spoke again from the\ncorner of his mouth, almost inaudibly.  “Are youse sure it was Stace\ncroaked Metzer?  Wot fer?  How’d yer know?”",
        "The Runt was listening, his eyes strained toward the stairs.  The\nhall door to the street was closed, but both were quite well aware\nthat there was an officer on guard outside.",
        "“He told me,” whispered the Runt.  “Metzer was fixin’ ter snitch on\nhim ter-night.  Dey’ve got de goods on Stace, too.  He made a bum\njob of it.”",
        "“Why didn’t he get out of de country den when he had de chanst,\ninstead of hangin’ around here all afternoon?” demanded Jimmie Dale.",
        "“He was broke,” the Runt answered.  “We was gettin’ de coin fer him\nter fade away wid ter-night, an’–”",
        "A revolver shot from above cut short his words.  Came then the sound\nof a struggle, oaths, the shuffling tread of feet–but in the dance\nhall the piano still rattled on, the mandolin twanged, voices sang\nand applauded, and beer mugs thumped time.",
        "They were on the stairs now, the officers, half carrying, half\ndragging some one between them–and the man they dragged cursed them\nwith utter abandon.  As they reached the bottom of the stairs,\nJimmie Dale caught sight of the prisoner’s face–not a prepossessing\none–villainous,–low-browed, contorted with a mixture of fear and\nrage.",
        "“It’s a lie!  A lie!  A lie!” the man shrieked.  “I never seen him\nin me life–blast you!–curse you!–d’ye hear!”",
        "Inspector Clayton caught Jimmie Dale and the Runt by the collars.",
        "“There’s nothing to interest you around here!” he snapped\nmaliciously.  “Go on, now–beat it!”  And he pushed them toward the\ndoor.",
        "They had heard the disturbance in the dance hall now and the\noccupants were swarming to the sidewalk.  A patrol wagon came around\nthe corner.  In the crowd Jimmie Dale slipped away from the Runt.",
        "Was he wrong, after all?  A fierce passion seized him.  It was Stace\nMorse who had murdered Metzer, the Runt had said.  In Jimmie Dale’s\nbrain the words began to reiterate themselves in a singsong fashion:\n\"It was Stace Morse.  It was Stace Morse.”  Then his lips drew tight\ntogether.  WAS it Stace Morse?  He would have given a good deal for\na chance to talk to the man–even for a minute.  But there was no\npossibility of that now.  Later, to-morrow perhaps, if he was wrong,\nafter all!",
        "Jimmie Dale returned to the Sanctuary, removed from his person all\nevidences of Larry the Bat–and from the Sanctuary went home to\nRiverside Drive.",
        "In his den there, in the morning after breakfast, Jason, the butler,\nbrought him the papers.  Three-inch headlines in red ink screamed,\nexulted, and shrieked out the news that the Gray Seal, in the person\nof Stace Morse, fence, yeggman and murderer, had been captured.  The\npublic, if it had held any private admiration for the one-time\nmysterious crook could now once and forever disillusion itself.  The\nGray Seal was Stace Morse–and Stace Morse was of the dregs of the\ncity’s scum, a pariah, an outcast, with no single redeeming trait to\nlift him from the ruck of mire and slime that had strewn his life\nfrom infancy.  The face of Inspector Clayton, blandly self-\ncomplacent, leaped out from the paper to meet Jimmie Dale’s eyes–\nand with it a column and a half of perfervid eulogy.",
        "Something at first like dismay, the dismay of impotency, filled\nJimmie Dale–and then, cold, leaving him unnaturally calm, the old\nmerciless rage took its place.  There was nothing to do now but\nwait–wait until Carruthers should send that photograph.  Then if,\nafter all, he were wrong–then he must find some other way.  But was\nhe wrong!  The notebook that Carruthers had given him, open at the\nsketch he had made of Clayton, lay upon the desk.  Jimmie Dale\npicked it up–he had already spent quite a little time over it\nbefore breakfast–and examined it again minutely, even resorting to\nhis magnifying glass.  He put it down as a knock sounded at the\ndoor, and Jason entered with a silver card tray.  From Carruthers\nalready!  Jimmie Dale stepped quickly forward–and then Jimmie Dale\nmet the old man’s eyes.  It wasn’t from Carruthers–it was from HER!",
        "“The same shuffer brought it, Master Jim,” said Jason.",
        "Jimmie Dale snatched the envelope from the tray, and waved the other\nfrom the room.  As the door closed, he tore open the letter.  There\nwas just a single line:",
        "Jimmie–Jimmie, you haven’t failed, have you?",
        "Jimmie Dale stared at it.  Failed!  Failed–HER!  The haggard look\nwas in his face again.  It was the bond between them that was at\nstake–the Gray Seal–the bond that had come, he knew for all time\nin that instant, to mean his life.",
        "“God knows!” he muttered hoarsely, and flung himself into a lounging\nchair, still staring at the note.",
        "The hours dragged by.  Luncheon time arrived and passed–and then by\nspecial messenger the little package from Carruthers came.",
        "Jimmie Dale started to undo the string, then laid the package down,\nand held out his hands before him for inspection.  They were\ntrembling visibly.  It was a strange condition for Jimmie Dale\neither to witness or experience, unlike him, foreign to him.",
        "“This won’t do, Jimmie,” he said grimly, shaking his head.",
        "He picked up the package again, opened it, and from between two\npieces of cardboard took out a large photographic print.  A moment,\ntwo, Jimmie Dale examined it, used the magnifying glass again; and\nthen a strange gleam came into the dark eyes, and his lips moved.",
        "“I’ve won,” said Jimmie Dale, with ominous softness.  I’ve WON!”",
        "He was standing beside the rosewood desk, and he reached for the\nphone.  Carruthers would be at home now–he called Carruthers there.\nAfter a moment or two he got the connection.",
        "“This is Jimmie, Carruthers,” he said.  “Yes, I got it.  Thanks. . . .\nYes. . . .  Listen.  I want you to get Inspector Clayton, and\nbring him up here at once. . . .  What?  No, no–no! . . .  How? . . .\nWhy–er–tell him you’re going to run a full page of him in the\nSunday edition, and you want him to sit for a sketch.  He’d go\nanywhere for that. . . .  Yes. . . .  Half an hour. . . .  YES. . . .\nGood-bye.”",
        "Jimmie Dale hung up the receiver; and, hastily now, began to write\nupon a pad that lay before him on the desk.  The minutes passed.  As\nhe wrote, he scored out words and lines here and there, substituting\nothers.  At the end he had covered three large pages with, to any\none but himself, an indecipherable scrawl.  These he shoved aside\nnow, and, very carefully, very legibly, made a copy on fresh sheets.\nAs he finished, he heard a car draw up in front of the house.\nJimmie Dale folded the copied sheets neatly, tucked them in his\npocket, lighted a cigarette, and was lolling lazily in his chair as\nJason announced: “Mr. Carruthers, sir, and another gentleman to see\nyou.”",
        "“Show them up, Jason,” instructed Jimmie Dale.",
        "Jimmie Dale rose from his chair as they came in.  Jason, well-\ntrained servant, closed the door behind them.",
        "“Hello, Carruthers; hello, inspector,” said Jimmie Dale pleasantly,\nand waved them to seats.  “Take this chair, Carruthers.”  He\nmotioned to one at his elbow.  “Glad to see you, inspector–try that\none in front of the desk, you’ll find it comfortable.”",
        "Carruthers, trying to catch Jimmie Dale’s eye for some sort of a\ncue, and, failing, sat down.  Inspector Clayton stared at Jimmie\nDale.",
        "“Oh, it’s YOU, eh?”  His eyes roved around the room, fastened for an\ninstant on some of Jimmie Dale’s work on an easel, came back finally\nto Jimmie Dale–and he plumped himself down in the chair indicated.\n\"Thought you was more’n a cub reporter,” he remarked, with a grin.\n\"You were too slick with your pencil.  Pretty fine studio you got\nhere.  Carruthers says you’re going to draw me.”",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled–not pleasantly–and leaned suddenly over the\ndesk.",
        "“Yes,” he said slowly, a grim intonation in his voice, “going to\ndraw you–TRUE TO LIFE.”",
        "With an exclamation, Clayton slued around in his chair, half rose,\nand his shifty eyes, small and cunning, bored into Jimmie Dale’s\nface.",
        "“What d’ye mean by that?” he snapped out",
        "“Just exactly what I say,” replied Jimmie Dale curtly.  “No more, no\nless.  But first, not to be too abrupt, I want to join with the\nnewspapers in congratulating you on the remarkable–shall I call it\ncelerity, or acumen?–with which you solved the mystery of Metzer’s\ndeath, and placed the murderer behind the bars.  It is really\nremarkable, inspector, so remarkable, in fact, that it’s almost–\nSUSPICIOUS.  Don’t you think so?  No?  Well, that’s what Mr.\nCarruthers was good enough to bring you up here to talk over–in an\nintimate and confidential way, you know.”",
        "Inspector Clayton surged up from his chair to his feet, his fists\nclenched, the red sweeping over his face–and then he shook one fist\nat Carruthers.",
        "“So that’s your game, is it!” he stormed.  “Trying to crawl out of\nthat twenty-five thousand reward, eh?  And as for you\"–he turned on\nJimmie Dale–\"you’ve rigged up a nice little plant between you, eh?\nWell, it won’t work–and I’ll make you squirm for this, both of you,\ndamn you, before I’m through!”  He glared from one to the other for\na moment–then swung on his heel.  “Good-afternoon, gentlemen,” he\nsneered, as he started for the door.",
        "He was halfway across the room before Jimmie Dale spoke.",
        "“Clayton!”",
        "Clayton turned.  Jimmie Dale was still leaning over the desk, but\nnow one elbow was propped upon it, and in the most casual way a\nrevolver covered Inspector Clayton.",
        "“If you attempt to leave this room,” said Jimmie Dale, without\nraising his voice, “I assure you that I shall fire with as little\ncompunction as though I were aiming at a mad dog–and I apologise to\nall mad dogs for coupling your name with them.”  His voice rang\nsuddenly cold.  “Come back here, and sit down in that chair!”",
        "The colour ebbed slowly from Clayton’s face.  He hesitated–then\nsullenly retraced his steps; hesitated again as he reached the\nchair, and finally sat down.",
        "“What–what d’ye mean by this?” he stammered, trying to bluster.",
        "“Just this,” said Jimmie Dale.  “That I accuse you of the murder of\nJake Metzer–IT WAS YOU WHO MURDERED METZER.”",
        "“Good God!” burst suddenly from Carruthers.",
        "“You lie!” yelled Clayton–and again he surged up from his chair.",
        "“That is what Stace Morse said,” said Jimmie Dale coolly.  “Sit\ndown!”",
        "Then Clayton tried to laugh.  “You’re–you’re having a joke, ain’t\nyou?  It was Stace–I can prove it.  Come down to headquarters, and\nI can prove it.  I got the goods on him all the way.  I tell you\"–\nhis voice rose shrilly–\"it was Stace Morse.”",
        "“You are a despicable hound,” said Jimmie Dale, through set lips.\n\"Here\"–he handed the revolver over to Carruthers–\"keep him\ncovered, Carruthers.  You’re going to the CHAIR for this, Clayton,\"\nhe said, in a fierce monotone.  “The chair!  You can’t send another\nthere in your place–this time.  Shall I draw you now–true to life?\nYou’ve been grafting for years on every disreputable den in your\ndistrict.  Metzer was going to show you up; and so, Metzer being in\nthe road, you removed him.  And you seized on the fact of Stace\nMorse having paid a visit to him this afternoon to fix the crime on–\nStace Morse.  Proofs?  Oh, yes, I know you’ve manufactured proofs\nenough to convict him–if there weren’t stronger proofs to convict\nYOU.”",
        "“Convict ME!” Clayton’s lower jaw hung loosely; but still he made an\neffort at bluster.  “You haven’t a thing on me–not a thing–not a\nthing.”",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled again–unpleasantly.",
        "“You are quite wrong, Clayton.  See–here.”  He took a sheet of paper\nfrom the drawer of his desk.",
        "Clayton reached for it quickly.  “What is it?” he demanded.",
        "Jimmie Dale drew it back out of reach.",
        "“Just a minute,” he said softly.  “You remember, don’t you, that in\nthe presence of Carruthers here, of myself, and of half a dozen\nreporters, you stated that you had been alone with Metzer in his\nroom at three o’clock yesterday, and that it was you–alone–who\nfound the body later on at nine o’clock?  Yes?  I mention this\nsimply to show that from your own lips the evidence is complete that\nyou had an OPPORTUNITY to commit the crime.  Now you may look at\nthis, Clayton.”  He handed over the sheet of paper.",
        "Clayton took it, stared at it, turning it over from first one side\nto the other.  Then a sort of relief seemed to come to him and he\ngulped.",
        "“Nothing but a damned piece of blank paper!” he mumbled.",
        "Jimmie Dale reached over and took back the sheet.",
        "“You’re wrong again, Clayton,” he said calmly.  “It WAS quite blank\nbefore I handed it to you–but not now.  I noticed yesterday that\nyour hands were generally moist.  I am sure they are more so now–\nexcitement, you know.  Carruthers, see that he doesn’t interrupt.”",
        "From a drawer, Jimmie Dale took out a little black bottle, the\nnotebook he had used the day before, and the photograph Carruthers\nhad sent him.  On the sheet of paper Clayton had just handled,\nJimmie Dale sprinkled a little powder from the bottle.",
        "“Lampblack,” explained Jimmie Dale.  He shook the paper carefully,\nallowing the loose powder to fall on the desk blotter–and held out\nthe sheet toward Clayton.  “Rather neat, isn’t it?  A very good\nimpression, too.  Your thumb print, Clayton.  Now don’t move.  You\nmay look–not touch.”  He laid the paper down on the desk in front\nof Clayton.  Beside it he placed the notebook, open at the sketch–a\nblack thumb print now upon it.  “You recall handling this yesterday,\nI’m sure, Clayton.  I tried the same experiment with the lampblack\non it this morning, you see.  And this\"–beside the notebook he\nplaced the police photograph; that, too, in its enlargement, showed,\nsharply defined, a thumb print on a diamond-shaped background.  “You\nwill no doubt recognise it as an official photograph, enlarged,\ntaken of the gray seal on Metzer’s forehead–AND THE THUMB PRINT OF\nMETZER’S MURDERER.  You have only to glance at the little scar at\nthe edge of the centre loop to satisfy yourself that the three are\nidentical.  Of course, there are a dozen other points of similarity\nequally indisputable, but–”",
        "Jimmie Dale stopped.  Clayton was on his feet–rocking on his feet.\nHis face was deathlike in its pallor.  Moisture was oozing from his\nforehead.",
        "“I didn’t do it!  I didn’t do it!” he cried out wildly.  “My God, I\ntell you, I DIDN’T do it–and–and–that would send me to the\nchair.”",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale coldly, “and that’s precisely where you’re\ngoing–to the chair.”",
        "The man was beside himself now–racked to the soul by a paroxysm of\nfear.",
        "“I’m innocent–innocent!” he screamed out.  “Oh, for God’s sake,\ndon’t send an innocent man to his death.  It WAS Stace Morse.\nListen!  Listen!  I’ll tell the truth.”  He was clawing with his\nhands, piteously, over the desk at Jimmie Dale.  “When the big\nrewards came out last week I stole one of the gray seals from the\nbunch at headquarters to–to use it the first time any crime was\ncommitted when I was sure I could lay my hands on the man who did\nit.  Don’t you see?  Of course he’d deny he was the Gray Seal, just\nas he’d deny that he was guilty–but I’d have the proof both ways\nand–and I’d collect the rewards, and–and–”  The man collapsed\ninto the chair.",
        "Carruthers was up from his seat, his hands gripping tight on the\nedge of the desk as he leaned over it.",
        "“Jimmie–Jimmie–what does this mean?” he gasped out.",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled–pleasantly now.",
        "“That he has told the truth,” said Jimmie Dale quietly.  “It is\nquite true that Stace Morse committed the murder.  Shows up the\nvalue of circumstantial evidence though, doesn’t it?  This would\ncertainly have got him off, and convicted Clayton here before any\njury in the land.  But the point is, Carruthers, that Stace Morse\nISN’T the Gray Seal–and that the Gray Seal is NOT a murderer.”",
        "Clayton looked up.  “You–you believe me?” he stammered eagerly.",
        "Jimmie Dale whirled on him in a sudden sweep of passion.",
        "“NO, you cur!” he flashed.  “It’s not you I believe.  I simply\nwanted your confession before witnesses.”  He whipped the three\nwritten sheets from his pocket.  “Here, substantially, is that\nconfession written out.”  He passed it to Carruthers.  “Read it to\nhim, Carruthers.”",
        "Carruthers read it aloud.",
        "“Now,” said Jimmie Dale grimly, “this spells ruin for you, Clayton.\nYou don’t deserve a chance to escape prison bars, but I’m going to\ngive you one, for you’re going to get it pretty stiff, anyhow.  If\nyou refuse to sign this, I’ll hand you over to the district attorney\nin half an hour, and Carruthers and I will swear to your confession;\non the other hand, if you sign it, Carruthers will not be able to\nprint it until to-morrow morning, and that gives you something like\nfourteen hours to put distance between yourself and New York.  Here\nis a pen–if you are quick enough to take us by surprise once you\nhave signed, you might succeed in making a dash for that door and\neffecting your escape–without forcing us to compound a felony–\nunderstand?”",
        "Clayton’s hand trembled violently as he seized the pen.  He scrawled\nhis name–looked from one to the other–wet his lips–and then,\ntaking Jimmie Dale at his word, rushed for the door–and the door\nslammed behind him.",
        "Carruthers’ face was hard.  “What did you let him go for, Jimmie?\"\nhe said uncompromisingly.",
        "“Selfishness.  Pure selfishness,” said Jimmie Dale softly.  “They’d\nguy me unmercifully if they ever heard of it at the St. James Club.\nThe honour is all yours, Carruthers.  I don’t appear on the stage.\nThat’s understood?  Yes?  Well, then\"–he handed over the signed\nconfession–\"is the ’scoop’ big enough?”",
        "Carruthers fingered the sheets, but his eyes in a bewildered way\nsearched Jimmie Dale’s face.",
        "“Big enough!” he echoed, as though invoking the universe.  “It’s the\nbiggest thing the newspaper game has ever known.  But how did you\ncome to do it?  What started you?  Where did you get your lead?”",
        "“Why, from you, I guess, Carruthers,” Jimmie Dale answered\nthoughtfully, with artfully puckered brow.  “I remembered that you\nhad said last week that the Gray Seal never left finger marks on his\nwork–and I saw one on the seal on Metzer’s forehead.  Then, you\nknow, I lifted one corner where the seal overlapped a thread of\nblood, and, underneath, the thread of blood wasn’t in the slightest\ndisturbed; so, of course, I knew the seal had been put on quite a\nlong time after the man was dead–not until the blood had dried\nthoroughly, to a crust, you know, so that even the damp surface of\nthe sticky side of the seal hadn’t affected it.  And then, I took a\ndislike to Clayton somehow–and put two and two together, and took a\nflyer in getting him to handle the notebook.  I  guess that’s all–\nno other reason on earth.  Jolly lucky, don’t you think?”",
        "Carruthers didn’t say anything for a moment.  When he spoke, it was\nirrelevantly.",
        "“You saved me twenty-five thousand dollars on that reward, Jimmie.”",
        "“That’s the only thing I regret,” said Jimmie Dale brightly.  “It\nwasn’t nice of you, Carruthers, to turn on the Gray Seal that way.\nAnd it strikes me you owe the chap, whoever he is, a pretty emphatic\nexoneration after what you said in this morning’s edition.”",
        "“Jimmie,” said Carruthers earnestly.  “You know what I thought of\nhim before.  It’s like a new lease of life to get back one’s faith\nin him.  You leave it to me.  I’ll put the Gray Seal on a pedestal\nto-morrow that will be worthy of the immortals–you leave it to me.”",
        "And Carruthers kept his word.  Also, before the paper had been an\nhour off the press, Carruthers received a letter.  It thanked\nCarruthers quite genuinely, even if couched in somewhat facetious\nterms, for his “sweeping vindication,” twitted him gently for his\n\"backsliding,” begged to remain “his gratefully,” and in lieu of\nsignature there was a gray-coloured piece of paper shaped like this:",
        "[Picture]",
        "Only there were no fingerprints on it.",
        "It was the following evening, and they had dined together again at\nthe St. James Club–Jimmie Dale, and Carruthers of the MORNING NEWS-\nARGUS.  From Clayton and a discussion of the Metzer murder, the\nconversation had turned, not illogically, upon the physiognomy of\ncriminals in general.  Jimmie Dale, lazily ensconced now in a\nlounging chair in one of the club’s private library rooms, flicked a\nminute speck of cigar ash from the sleeve of his dinner jacket, and\nsmiled whimsically across the table at his friend.",
        "“Oh, I dare say there’s a lot in physiognomy, Carruthers,” he\ndrawled.  “Never studied the thing, you know–that is, from the\nstandpoint of crime.  Personally, I’ve only got one prejudice: I\ndistrust, on principle, the man who wears a perennial and pompous\nsmirk–which isn’t, of course, strictly speaking, physiognomy at\nall.  You see, a man can’t help his eyes being beady or his nose\npronounced, but pomposity and a smirk, now–”  Jimmie Dale shrugged\nhis shoulders.",
        "Carruthers laughed–and then glanced ludicrously at Jimmie Dale, as\nthe door, ajar, was pushed open, and a man entered.",
        "“Speaking of angels,” murmured Jimmie Dale–and sat up in his chair.\n\"Hello, Markel!” he observed casually, “You’ve met Carruthers, of\nthe NEWS-ARGUS, haven’t you?”",
        "Markel was fat and important; he had beady black eyes, fastidiously\ntrimmed whiskers–and a pronounced smirk.",
        "Markel blew his nose vigorously, coughed asthmatically, and held out\nhis hand.",
        "“Of course, certainly,” said he effusively.  “I’ve met Carruthers\nseveral times–used his sheet more than once to advertise a new bond\nflotation.”",
        "The dominant note in Markel’s voice was an ingratiating and\nunpleasant whine, and Carruthers nodded, not very cordially–and\nshook hands.",
        "Markel went back to the door, closed it carefully, and returned to\nthe table.",
        "“Fact is,” he smiled confidentially, “I saw you two come in here a\nfew minutes ago, and I’ve got something that I thought Carruthers\nmight be glad to have for his society column–say, in the Sunday\nedition.”",
        "He dove into the inside pocket of his coat, produced a large morocco\nleather jeweller’s case, and, holding it out over the table between\nCarruthers and Jimmie Dale, suddenly snapped the cover open–and\nthen, with a complacent little chuckle that terminated in another\nfit of coughing, spilled the contents on the table under the\nelectric reading lamp.",
        "Like a thing of living, pulsing fire it rolled before their eyes–a\nmagnificent diamond necklace, of wondrous beauty, gleaming and\nscintillating as the light rays shot back from a thousand facets.",
        "For a moment, both men gazed at it without a word.",
        "“Little surprise for my wife,” volunteered Markel, with a debonair\nwave of his pudgy hand, and trying to make his voice sound careless.",
        "The case lay open–patently displaying the name of the most famous\njewelry house in America.  Jimmie Dale’s eyes fixed on Markel’s\nwhiskers where they were brushed outward in an ornate and fastidious\ngray-black sweep.",
        "“By Jove!” he commented.  “You don’t do things by halves, do you,\nMarkel?”",
        "“Two hundred and ten thousand dollars I paid for that little bunch\nof gewgaws,” said Markel, waving his hand again.  Then he clapped\nCarruthers heartily on the shoulder.  “What do you think of it,\nCarruthers–eh?  Say, a photograph of it, and one of Mrs. Markel–\neh?  Please her, you know–she’s crazy on this society stunt–all\nflubdub to me of course.  How’s it strike you, Carruthers?”",
        "Carruthers, very evidently, liked neither the man nor his manners,\nbut Carruthers, above everything else, was a gentleman.",
        "“To be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Markel,” he said a little\nfrigidly, “I don’t believe in this sort of thing.  It’s all right\nfrom a newspaper standpoint, and we do it; but it’s just in this way\nthat owners of valuable jewelry lay themselves open to theft.  It\nsimply amounts to advising every crook in the country that you have\na quarter of a million at his disposal, which he can carry away in\nhis vest pocket, once he can get his hands on it–and you invite him\nto try.”",
        "Jimmie Dale laughed.  “What Carruthers means, Markel, is that you’ll\nhave the Gray Seal down your street.  Carruthers talks of crooks\ngenerally, but he thinks in terms of only one.  He can’t help it.\nHe’s been trying so long to catch the chap that it’s become an\nobsession.  Eh, Carruthers?”",
        "Carruthers smiled seriously.  “Perhaps,” he admitted.  “I hope,\nthough, for Mr. Markel’s sake, that the Gray Seal won’t take a fancy\nto it–if he does, Mr. Markel can say good-bye to his necklace.”",
        "“Pouf!” coughed Markel arrogantly.  “Overrated!  His cleverness is\nall in the newspaper columns.  If he knows what’s good for him,\nhe’ll know enough to leave this alone.”",
        "Jimmie Dale was leaning over the table poking gingerly with the tip\nof his forefinger at the centre stone in the setting, revolving it\ngently to and fro in the light–a very large stone, whose weight\nwould hardly be less than fifteen carats.  Jimmie Dale lowered his\nhead for a closer examination–and to hide a curious, mocking little\ngleam that crept into his dark eyes.",
        "“Yes, I should say you’re right, Markel,” he agreed judicially.  “He\nought to know better than to touch this.  It–it would be too hard\nto dispose of.”",
        "“I’m not worrying,” declared Markel importantly.",
        "“No,” said Jimmie Dale.  “Two hundred and ten thousand, you said.\nAny special–er–significance to the occasion, if the question’s not\nimpertinent?  Birthday, wedding anniversary–or something like\nthat?”",
        "“No, nothing like that!” Markel grinned, winked secretively, and\nrubbed his hands together.  “I’m feeling good, that’s all–I’m going\nto make the killing of my life to-morrow.”",
        "“Oh!” said Jimmie Dale.",
        "Markel turned to Carruthers.  “I’ll let you in on that, too,\nCarruthers, in a day or two, if you’ll send a reporter around–\nfinancial man, you know.  It’ll be worth your while.  And now, how\nabout this?  What do you say to a little article and the photos next\nSunday?”",
        "There was a slight hint of rising colour in Carruthers’ face.",
        "“If you’ll send them to the society editor, I’ve no doubt he’ll be\nable to use them,” he said brusquely.",
        "“Right!” said Markel, and coughed, and patted Carruthers’ shoulder\npatronisingly again.  “I’ll just do that little thing.”  He picked\nup the necklace, dangled it till it flashed and flashed again under\nthe light, then restored it very ostentatiously to its case, and the\ncase to his pocket.  “Thanks awfully, Carruthers,” he said, as he\nrose from his chair.  “See you again, Dale.  Good-night!”",
        "Carruthers glared at the door as it closed behind the man.",
        "“Say it!” prodded Jimmie Dale sweetly.  “Don’t feel restrained\nbecause you are a guest–I absolve you in advance.”",
        "“Rotter!” said Carruthers.",
        "“Well,” said Jimmie Dale softly.  “You see–Carruthers?”",
        "Carruthers’ match crackled savagely as he lighted a cigar.",
        "“Yes, I see,” he growled.  “But I don’t see–you’ll pardon my saying\nso–how vulgarity like that ever acquired membership in the St.\nJames Club.”",
        "“Carruthers,” said Jimmie Dale plaintively, “you ought to know\nbetter than that.  You know, to begin with, since it seems he has\nadvertised with you, that he runs some sort of brokerage business in\nBoston.  He’s taken a summer home up here on Long Island, and some\nmisguided chap put him on the club’s visitor’s list.  His card will\nNOT be renewed.  Sleek customer, isn’t he?  Trifle familiar–I was\nonly introduced to him last night.”",
        "Carruthers grunted, broke his burned match into pieces, and began to\ntoss the pieces into an ash tray.",
        "Jimmie Dale became absorbed in an inspection of his hands–those\nwonderful hands with long, slim, tapering fingers, whose clean, pink\nflesh masked a strength and power that was like to a steel vise.",
        "Jimmie Dale looked up.  “Going to print a nice little story for him\nabout the ’costliest and most beautiful necklace in America’?” he\ninquired innocently.",
        "Carruthers scowled.  “No,” he said bluntly.  “I am not.  He’ll read\nthe NEWS-ARGUS a long time before he reads anything about that,\nJimmie.”",
        "But therein Carruthers was wrong–the NEWS-ARGUS carried the “story\"\nof Markel’s diamond necklace in three-inch “caps” in red ink on the\nfront page in the next morning’s edition–and Carruthers gloated\nover it because the morning NEWS-ARGUS was the ONLY paper in New\nYork that did.  Carruthers was to hear more of Markel and Markel’s\nnecklace than he thought, though for the time being the subject\ndropped between the two men.",
        "It was still early, barely ten o’clock, when Carruthers left the\nclub, and, preferring to walk to the newspaper offices, refused\nJimmie Dale’s offer of his limousine.  It was but five minutes later\nwhen Jimmie Dale, after chatting for a moment or two with those\nabout in the lobby, in turn sought the coat room, where Markel was\nbeing assisted into his coat.",
        "“Getting home early, aren’t you, Markel?” remarked Jimmie Dale\npleasantly.",
        "“Yes,” said Markel, and ran his fingers fussily, comb fashion,\nthrough his whiskers.  “Quite a little run out to my place, you\nknow–and with, you know what, I don’t care to be out too late.”",
        "“No, of course,” concurred Jimmie Dale, getting into his own coat.",
        "They walked out of the club together, and Markel climbed importantly\ninto the tonneau of a big gray touring car.",
        "“Ah–home, Peters,” he sniffed at his chauffeur; and then, with a\ngrandiloquent wave of his hand to Jimmie Dale: “’Night, Dale.”",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled with his eyes–which were hidden by the brim of\nhis bat.",
        "“Good-night, Markel,” he replied, and the smile crept curiously to\nthe corners of his mouth as he watched the gray car disappear down\nthe street.",
        "A limousine drew up, and Benson, Jimmie Dale’s chauffeur, opened the\ndoor.",
        "“Home, Mr. Dale?” he asked cheerily, touching his cap.  “Yes,\nBenson–home,” said Jimmie Dale absently, and stepped into the car.",
        "It was a luxurious car, as everything that belonged to Jimmie Dale\nwas luxurious–and he leaned back luxuriously on the cushions,\nextended his legs luxuriously to their full length, plunged his\nhands into his overcoat pockets–and then a change stole strangely,\nslowly over Jimmie Dale.",
        "The sensitive fingers of his right hand in the pocket had touched,\nand now played delicately over a sealed envelope that they had found\nthere, played over it as though indeed by the sense of touch alone\nthey could read the contents–and he drew his body gradually erect.",
        "It was another of those mysterious missives from–HER.  The texture\nof the paper was invariably the same–like this one.  How had it\ncome there?  Collusion with the coat boy at the club?  That was\nhardly probable.  Perhaps it had been there before he had entered\nthe club for dinner–he remembered, now, that there had been several\npeople passing, and that he had been jostled slightly in crossing\nthe sidewalk.  What, however, did it matter?  It was there\nmysteriously, as scores of others had come to him mysteriously, with\nnever a clew to her identity, to the identity of his–he smiled a\nlittle grimly–accomplice in crime.",
        "He took the envelope from his pocket and stared at it.  His fingers\nhad not been at fault–it was one of hers.  The faint, elusive,\nexquisite fragrance of some rare perfume came to him as he held it.",
        "“I’d give,” said Jimmie Dale wistfully to himself–\"I’d give\neverything I own to know who you are–and some day, please God, I\nwill know.”",
        "Jimmie Dale tore the envelope very gently, as though the tearing\nalmost were an act of desecration–and extracted the letter from\nwithin.  He began to read aloud hurriedly and in snatches:",
        "“DEAR PHILANTHROPIC CROOK: Charleton Park Manor–Markel’s house is\nthe second one from the gates on the right-hand side–library leads\noff reception hall on left, door opposite staircase–telephone in\nreception hall near vestibule entrance, left-hand side–safe is one\nof your father’s make, No. 14,321–clothes closet behind the desk–\nprobably will be kept in cash box–five servants; two men, three\nmaids–quarters on top story–Markel and wife occupy room over\nlibrary–French windows to dining room on opposite side of the\nhouse–opening on the lawn–get it TO-NIGHT, Jimmie–TO-MORROW WOULD\nBE TOO LATE–dispose of it–see fit–Henry Wilbur, Marshall\nBuilding, Broadway–fifth story–”",
        "Through the glass-panelled front of the car, Jimmie Dale could see\nhis chauffeur’s back, and the hand that held the letter dropped now\nto his side, and Jimmie Dale stared–at his chauffeur’s back.  Then,\npresently, he read the letter again, as though committing it to\nmemory now; and then, tearing the paper into tiny shreds, as he did\nwith every one of her communications, he reached out of the window\nand allowed the little pieces to filter gradually from his hand.",
        "The Gray Seal!  He smiled in his whimsical way.  If it were ever\nknown!  He, Jimmie Dale, with his social standing, his wealth, his\nposition–the Gray Seal!  Not a police official, not a secret-\nservice bureau probably in the civilised world, but knew the name–\nnot a man, woman, or child certainly in this great city around him\nbut to whom it was as familiar as their own!  Danger?  Yes.  A\nbattle of wits?  Yes.  His against everybody’s–even against\nCarruthers’, his old college chum!  For, even as a reporter, before\nhe had risen to the editorial desk, and even now that he had,\nCarruthers had been one of the keenest on the scent of the Gray\nSeal.",
        "Danger?  Yes.  But it was worth it!  Worth it a thousand times for\nthe very lure of the danger itself; but worth it most of all for his\nassociation with her who, by some amazing means, verging indeed on\nthe miraculous, came into touch with all these things, and supplied\nhim with the data on which to work–that always some wrong might be\nrighted, or gladness come where there had been gloom before, or hope\nwhere there had been despair–that into some fellow human’s heart\nshould come a gleam of sunshine.  Yes, in spite of the howls of the\npolice, the virulent diatribes of the press, an angry public\nscreaming for his arrest, conviction, and punishment, there were\nthose perhaps who even on their bended knees at night asked God’s\nblessing on–the Gray Seal!",
        "Was it strange, then, after all, that the police, seeking a clew\nthrough motive, should have been driven to frenzy on every occasion\nin finding themselves forever confronted with what, from every angle\nthey were able to view it, was quite a purposeless crime!  On one\npoint only they were right, the old dogma, the old, old cry, old as\nthe institution of police, older than that, old since time\nimmemorial–CHERCHEZ LA FEMME!  Quite right–but also quite\npurposeless!  Jimmie Dale’s eyes grew wistful.  He had been “hunting\nfor the woman in the case” himself, now, for months and years\nindefatigably, using every resource at his command–quite\npurposelessly.",
        "Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders.  Why go over all this to-night–\nthere were other things to do.  She had come to him again–and this\ntime with a matter that entailed more than ordinary difficulty, more\nthan usual danger, that would tax his wits and his skill to the\nutmost, not only to succeed, but to get out of it himself with a\nwhole skin.  Markel–eh?  Jimmie Dale leaned back in his seat,\nclasped his hands behind his head–and his eyes, half closed now,\nwere studying Benson’s back again through the plate-glass front.",
        "He was still sitting in that position as the car approached his\nresidence on Riverside Drive–but, as it came to a stop, and Benson\nopened the door, it was a very alert Jimmie Dale that stepped to the\nsidewalk.",
        "“Benson,” he said crisply, “I am going downtown again later on, but\nI shall drive myself.  Bring the touring car around and leave it in\nfront of the house.  I’ll run it into the garage when I get back–\nyou need not wait up.”",
        "“Very good, sir,” said Benson.",
        "In the hallway, Jason, the butler, who had been butler to Jimmie\nDale’s father before him, took Jimmie Dale’s hat and coat.",
        "“It’s a fine evening, Master Jim,” said the privileged old man\naffectionately.",
        "Jimmie Dale took out his silver cigarette case, selected a\ncigarette, tapped it daintily on the cover of the case–and accepted\nthe match the old man hastily produced.",
        "“Yes, Jason.” said Jimmie Dale, pleasantly facetious, “it a fine\nnight, a glorious night, moon and stars and a balmy breeze–quite\ntoo fine, indeed, to remain indoors.  In fact, you might lay out my\ngray ulster; I think I will go for a spin presently, when I have\nchanged.”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Jason.  “Anything else, Master Jim?”",
        "“No; that’s all, Jason.  Don’t sit up for me–you may go to bed\nnow.”",
        "“Thank you, sir,” said the old man.",
        "Jimmie Dale went upstairs, opened the door of his own particular den\non the right of the landing, stepped inside, closed the door,\nswitched on the light–and Jimmie Dale’s debonair nonchalance\ndropped from him as a mask instantly–and it was another Jimmie\nDale–the professional Jimmie Dale.",
        "Quick now in every action, he swung aside the portiere that\ncurtained off the squat, barrel-shaped safe in the little alcove,\nopened the safe, took out that curious leather girdle with its kit\nof burglar’s tools, added to it a flashlight and an automatic\nrevolver, closed the safe–and passed into his dressing room.  Here,\nhe proceeded to divest himself rapidly of his evening clothes,\nselecting in their stead a suit of dark tweed.  He heard Jason come\nup the stairs, pass along the hall, and mount the second flight to\nhis own quarters; and presently came the sound of an automobile\nwithout.  The dressing room fronted on the Drive–Jimmie Dale looked\nout.  Benson was just getting out of the touring car.  Slipping the\nleather girdle, then, around his waist, Jimmie Dale put on his vest,\nthen his coat–and walked briskly downstairs.",
        "Jason had laid out a gray ulster on the hall stand.  Jimmie Dale put\nit on, selected a leather cap with motor-goggle attachment that\npulled down almost to the tip of his nose, tucked a slouch hat into\nthe pocket of the ulster, and, leaving the house, climbed into his\ncar.",
        "He glanced at his watch as he started–it was a quarter of eleven.\nJimmie Dale’s lips pursed a little.",
        "“I guess it’ll make a night of it, and a tight squeeze, at that, to\nget back under cover before daylight,” he muttered.  “I’ll have to\ndo some tall speeding.”",
        "But at first, across the city and through Brooklyn, for all his\nimpatience, it was necessarily slow–after that, Jimmie Dale took\nchances, and, once on the country roads of Long Island, the big,\npowerful car tore through the night like a greyhound whose leash is\nslipped.",
        "A half hour passed–Jimmie Dale’s eyes shifting occasionally from\nthe gray thread of road ahead of him under the glare of the dancing\nlamps, to the road map spread out at his feet, upon which, from time\nto time, he focused his pocket flashlight.  And then, finally, he\nslowed the car to a snail’s pace–he should be very near his\ndestination–that very ultra-exclusive subdivision of Charleton Park\nManor.",
        "On either side of the road now was quite a thickly set stretch of\nwooded land, rising slightly on the right–and this Jimmie Dale\nscrutinised sharply.  In fact, he stopped for an instant as he came\nopposite to a wagon track–it seemed to be little more than that–\nthat led in through the trees.",
        "“If it’s not too far from the seat of war,” commented Jimmie Dale to\nhimself, as he went on again, “it will do admirably.”",
        "And then, a hundred yards farther on, Jimmie Dale nodded his head in\nsatisfaction–he was passing the rather ornate stone pillars that\nmarked the entrance to Charleton Park Manor, and on which the\ninitial promoters of the subdivision, the real-estate people, had\nevidently deemed it good advertising policy to expend a small\nfortune.",
        "Another hundred yards farther on, Jimmie Dale turned his car around\nand returned past the gates to the wagon track again.  The road was\ndeserted–not a car nor a vehicle of any description was in sight.\nJimmie Dale made sure of that–and in another instant Jimmie Dale’s\nown car, every light extinguished, had vanished–he had backed it up\nthe wagon track, just far enough in for the trees to screen it\nthoroughly from the main road.",
        "Nor did Jimmie Dale himself appear again on the main road–until\njust as he emerged close to the gates of Charleton Park Manor from a\nshort cut through the woods.  Also, he was without his ulster now,\nand the slouch hat had replaced the motor cap.",
        "Jimmie Dale, in the moonlight, took stock of his surroundings, as he\npassed in at a businesslike walk through the gates.  It was a large\npark, if that name could properly be applied to it at all, and the\nhouses–he caught sight of one set back from the driveway on the\nright–were quite far apart, each in its own rather spacious grounds\namong the trees.",
        "“The second house on the right,” her letter had said.  Jimmie Dale\nhad already passed the first one–the next would be Markel’s then–\nand it loomed ahead of him now, black and shadowy and unlighted.",
        "Jimmie Dale shot a glance around him–there was stillness, quiet\neverywhere–no sign of life–no sound.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face became tense, his lips tight–and he stepped\nsuddenly from the sidewalk in among the trees.  They were not thick\nhere, of course, the trees, and the turf beneath his feet was well\nkept–and, therefore, soundless.  He moved quickly now, but\ncautiously, from tree to tree, for the moonlight, flooding the lawn\nand house, threw all objects into bold relief.",
        "A minute, two, three went by–and a shadow flitted here and there\nacross the light-green sward, like the moving of the trees swaying\nin the breeze–and then Jimmie Dale was standing close up against\none side of the house, hidden by the protecting black shadows of the\nwalls.",
        "But here, for a moment, Jimmie Dale seemed little occupied with the\nhouse itself–he was staring down past its length to where the woods\nmade a heavy, dark background at the rear.  Then he turned his head,\nto face directly to the main road, then back again slowly, as though\nmeasuring an angle.  Jimmie Dale had no intention of making his\nescape by the roundabout way in which he had been forced to come in\norder to make certain of locating the right house, the second one\nfrom the gates–and he was getting the bearings of his car and the\nwagon track now.",
        "“I guess that’ll be about right,” Jimmie Dale muttered finally.\n\"And now for–”",
        "He slipped along the side of the house and halted where, almost on a\nlevel with the ground, the French windows of the dining room opened\non the lawn.  Jimmie Dale tried them gently.  They were locked.",
        "An indulgent smile crept to Jimmie Dale’s lips–and his hand crept\nin under his vest.  It came out again–not empty–and Jimmie Dale\nleaned close against the window.  There was a faint, almost\ninaudible, scratching sound, then a slight, brittle crack–and\nJimmie Dale laid a neat little four-inch square of glass on the\nground at his feet.  Through the aperture he reached in his hand,\nturned the key that was in the lock, turned the bolt-rod handle,\npushed the doors silently open–wide open–left them open–and\nstepped into the room.",
        "He could see quite well within, thanks to the moonlight.  Jimmie\nDale produced a black silk mask from one of the little leather\npockets, adjusted it carefully over his face, and crossed the room\nto the hall door.  He opened this–wide open–left it open–and\nentered the hall.",
        "Here it was dark–a pitch blackness.  He stood for a moment,\nlistening–utter silence.  And then–alert, strained, tense in an\ninstant, Jimmie Dale crouched against the wall–and then he smiled a\nlittle grimly.  It was only some one coughing upstairs–Markel–in\nhis sleep, perhaps, or, perhaps–in wakefulness.",
        "“I’m a fool!” confided Jimmie Dale to himself, as he recognised the\ncough that he had heard at the club.  “And yet–I don’t know.  One’s\nnerves get sort of taut.  Pretty stiff business.  If I’m ever\ncaught, the penitentiary sentence I get will be the smallest part of\nwhat’s to pay.”",
        "A round button of light played along the wall from the flashlight in\nhis hand–just for an instant–and all was blackness again.  But in\nthat instant Jimmie Dale was across the hall, and his fingers were\ntracing the telephone connection from the instrument to where the\nwires disappeared in the baseboard of the floor.  Another instant,\nand he had severed the wires with a pair of nippers.",
        "Again the quick, firefly gleam of light to locate the stair case and\nthe library door opposite to it–and, moving without the slightest\nnoise, Jimmie Dale’s hand was on the door itself.  Again he paused\nto listen.  All was silence now.",
        "The door swung under his hand, and, left open behind him, he was in\nthe room.  The flashlight winked once–suspiciously.  Then he\nsnapped its little switch, keeping the current on, and the ray\ndodged impudently here and there all over the apartment.",
        "The safe was set in a sort of clothes closet behind the desk, she\nhad said.  Yes, there it was–the door, at least.  Jimmie Dale moved\ntoward it–and paused as his light swept the top of the intervening\ndesk.  A mass of papers, books, and correspondence littered it\nuntidily.  The yellow sheet of a telegram caught Jimmie Dale’s eye.",
        "He picked it up and glanced at it.  It read:",
        "“Vein uncovered to-day.  Undoubtedly mother lode.  Enormously rich.\nPut the screws on at once.  THURL.”",
        "Under the mask, Jimmie Dale’s lips twitched.",
        "“I think, Markel, you miserable hound,” said he softly, that God\nwill forgive me for depriving you of a share of the profits.  Two\nhundred and ten thousand, I think it was, you said the sparklers\ncost.”  A curious little sound came from Jimmie Dale’s lips–like a\nchuckle.",
        "Jimmie Dale tossed the telegram back on the desk, moved on behind\nthe desk, opened the door of the closet that had been metamorphosed\ninto a vault–and the white light travelled slowly, searchingly,\ncritically over the shining black-enamelled steel, the nickelled\nknobs, and dials of a safe that confronted him.",
        "Jimmie Dale nodded at it–familiarly, grimly.",
        "“It’s number one-four-three-two-one, all right,” he murmured.  “And\none of the best we ever made.  Pretty tough.  But I’ve done it\nbefore.  Say, half an hour of gentle persuasion.  It would be too\nbad to crack it with ’soup’–besides, that’s crude–Carruthers would\nnever forgive the Gray Seal for that!”",
        "The light went out–blackness fell.  Jimmie Dale’s slim, sensitive\nfingers closed on the dial’s knob, his head touched the steel front\nof the safe as he pressed his ear against it for the tumblers’ fall.",
        "And then silence.  It seemed to grow heavier, that silence, with\neach second–to palpitate through the quiet house–to grow pregnant,\npremonitory of dread, of fear–it seemed to throb in long\nundulations, and the stillness grew LOUD.  A moonbeam filtered in\nbetween the edge of the drawn shade and the edge of the window.  It\nstruggled across the floor in a wavering path, strayed over the\ndesk, and died away, shadowy and formless, against the blackness of\nthe opened recess door, against the blackness of the great steel\nsafe, the blackness of a huddled form crouched against it.  Only now\nand then, in a strange, projected, wraithlike effect, the moon ray\nglinted timidly on the tip of a nickel dial, and, ghostlike,\ndisclosed a human hand.",
        "Upstairs, Markel coughed again.  Then from the safe a whisper,\nheavy-breathed as from great exertion:",
        "“Missed It!”",
        "The dial whirled with faint, musical, little metallic clicks; then\nbegan to move slowly again, very, very slowly.  The moonbeam, as\nthough petulant at its own abortive attempt to satisfy its\ncuriosity, retreated back across the floor, and faded away.",
        "Blackness!",
        "Time passed.  Then from the safe again, but now in a low gasp, a\npant of relief:",
        "“Ah!”",
        "The ear might barely catch the sound–it was as of metal sliding in\nwell-oiled grooves, of metal meeting metal in a padded thud.  The\nmassive door swung outward.  Jimmie Dale stood up, easing his\ncramped muscles, and flirted the sweat beads from his forehead.",
        "After a moment, he knelt again.  There was still the inner door–but\nthat was a minor matter to Jimmie Dale compared with what had gone\nbefore.",
        "Stillness once more–a long period of it.  And then again that cough\nfrom above–a prolonged paroxysm of it this time that went racketing\nthrough the house.",
        "Jimmie Dale, in the act of swinging back the inner door of the safe,\npaused to listen, and little furrows under his mask gathered on his\nforehead.  The coughing stopped.  Jimmie Dale waited a moment, still\nlistening–then his flashlight bored into the interior of the safe.",
        "“The cash box, probably,” quoted Jimmie Dale, beneath his breath–\nand picked it up from where it lay in the bottom compartment of the\nsafe.",
        "The lock snipped under the insistent probe of a delicate little\nblued-steel instrument, and Jimmie Dale lifted the cover.  There was\na package of papers and documents on top, held together with elastic\nbands.  Jimmie Dale spent a moment or two examining these, then his\nfingers dived down underneath, and the next minute, under the\nflashlight, the morocco leather case open, the diamond necklace was\nsparkling and flashing on its white satin bed.",
        "“A tempting little thing, isn’t it?” said Jimmie Dale gently.  “It\nwas really thoughtful of you, Markel, to buy that this afternoon!”",
        "Jimmie Dale replaced the necklace in the cash box, set the cash box\non the floor, closed the inner door of the safe, and swung the outer\ndoor a little inward–but left it flauntingly ajar.  Then from a\npocket of the leather girdle beneath his vest he produced his small,\nthin, flat, metal case.  From this, from between sheets of oil\npaper, with the aid of a pair of tweezers, he lifted out a gray,\ndiamond-shaped seal.  Jimmie Dale was apparently fastidious.  He\nheld the seal with the tweezers as he moistened the adhesive side\nwith his tongue, laid the seal on his handkerchief, and pressed the\nhandkerchief firmly against the safe–as usual, Jimmie Dale’s\ninsignia bore no finger prints as it lay neatly capping the knob of\nthe dial.",
        "He reached down, picked up the cash box–and then, for the second\ntime that night, held suddenly tense, alert, listening, his every\nmuscle taut.  A door opened upstairs.  There came a murmur of\nvoices.  Then a momentary lull.",
        "Jimmie Dale listened.  Like a statue he stood there in the black,\nabsolutely motionless–his head a little forward and to one side.\nNothing–not a sound.  Then a very low, curious, swishing noise, and\na faint creak.  SOMEBODY WAS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS!",
        "Jimmie Dale moved stealthily from the recess, and noiselessly to the\ndesk.  Very faintly, but distinctly now, came a pad of either\nslippered or bare feet on the stairway carpet.  Like a cat,\nsoundless in his movements, Jimmie Dale crept toward the door of the\nroom.  Down the stairs came that pad of feet; occasionally came that\nswishing sound.  Nearer the door crept Jimmie Dale, and his lips\nwere thinned now, his jaws clamped.  How near were they together, he\nand this night prowler?  At times he could not hear the other at\nall, and, besides, the heavy carpet made the judgment of distance an\nimpossibility.  If he could gain the hall, and, in the darkness,\nelude the other, the way of escape through the dining room was open.\nAnd then, within a few feet of the door, Jimmie Dale halted\nabruptly, as a woman’s voice rose querulously from the hallway\nabove:",
        "“You are making a perfect fool of yourself, Theodore Markel!  Come\nback here to bed!”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face hardened like stone–the answer came almost from\nthe very threshold in front of him:",
        "“I can’t sleep, I tell you\"–it was Markel’s voice, in a disgruntled\nsnarl.  “I was a fool to bring the confounded thing home.  I’m going\nto take the library couch for the rest of the night.”",
        "It happened quick, then–quick as the winking of an eye.  Two sharp,\nalmost simultaneous, clicks of the electric-light buttons pressed\nby Markel, and the hall and library were a flood of light–and\nJimmie Dale leaped forward to where, in dressing gown and pajamas,\nblankets and bedding over one arm, a revolver dangling in the other\nhand, Markel stood full before the door in the hallway without.",
        "There was a wild yell of terror and surprise from Markel, then a\ndeafening roar and a spit of flame from his revolver–a bitter,\nsmothered exclamation from Jimmie Dale as the cash box crashed to\nthe floor from his left hand, and he was upon the other like a\ntiger.",
        "With the impact, both men went to the floor, grappled, and rolled\nover and over.  Half mad with fear, shock, and surprise, Markel\nfought like a maniac, and his voice, in gasping shouts, rang through\nthe house.",
        "A minute, two passed–and the men rolled about the hall floor.\nMarkel, over middle age and unheathily fat, against Jimmie Dale’s\nsix feet of muscle–only Jimmie Dale’s left hand, dripping a red\nstream now, was almost useless.",
        "From above came wild confusion–women’s voices in little shrieks;\nmen’s voices shouting in excitement; doors opening, running feet.\nAnd then Jimmie Dale had snatched the revolver from the floor where\nMarkel had dropped it in the scuffle, and was pressing it against\nMarkel’s forehead–and Markel, terror-stricken, had collapsed in a\nflabby, pliant heap.",
        "Jimmie Dale, still covering Markel with the weapon, stood up.  The\nfrightened faces of women protruded over the banisters above.  The\ntwo men-servants, at best none too enthusiastically on the way down,\nstopped as though stunned as Jimmie Dale swung the revolver upon\nthem.",
        "Then Jimmie Dale spoke–to Markel–pointing the weapon at Markel\nagain.",
        "“I don’t like you, Markel,” he said, with cold impudence.  The only\ndecent thing you’ll ever do will be to die–and if those men of\nyours on the stairs move another step it will be your death warrant.\nDo you understand?  I would suggest that you request them to stay\nwhere they are.”",
        "Cold sweat was on Markel’s face as he stared into the muzzle of the\nrevolver, and his teeth chattered.",
        "“Go back!” he screamed hysterically at the servants.  “Go back!  Sit\ndown!  Don’t move!  Do what he tells you!”",
        "“Thank you!” said Jimmie Dale grimly.  “Now, get up yourself!”",
        "Markel got up.",
        "Jimmie Dale backed to the library door, picked up the cash box,\ntucked it under his left armpit, and faced those on the stairs.",
        "“Mr. Markel and I are going out for a little walk,” he announced\ncoolly.  “If one of you make a move or raise an alarm before your\nmaster comes back, I shall be obliged, in self-defence, to shoot–\nMr. Markel.  Mr. Markel quite understands that–I am sure.  Do you\nnot, Mr. Markel?”",
        "“Helen,” screamed Markel to his wife, “don’t let ’em move!  For\nGod’s sake, do as he says!”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s lips, just showing beneath the edge of his mask,\nbroadened in a pleasant little smile.",
        "“Will you lead the way, Mr. Markel?” he requested, with ironic\ndeference.  “Through the dining room, please.  Yes, that’s right!",
        "Markel walked weakly into the dining room, and Jimmie Dale followed.\nA prod in the back from the revolver muzzle, and Markel stepped\nthrough the French windows and out on the lawn.  Jimmie Dale faced\nthe other toward the woods at the rear of the house.",
        "“Go on!” Jimmie Dale’s voice was curt now, uncompromising.  “And\nstep lively!”",
        "They passed on along the side of the house and in among the trees.\nFifty yards or so more, and Jimmie Dale halted.  He backed Markel up\nagainst a large tree–not over gently.",
        "“I–I say\"–Markel’s teeth were going like castanets.  “I–”",
        "“You’ll oblige me by keeping your mouth shut,” observed Jimmie Dale\npolitely–and he whipped the cord of Markel’s dressing gown loose\nand began to tie the man to the tree.  “You have many unpleasant\ncharacteristics, Markel–your voice is one of them.  Shall I repeat\nthat I do not like you?”  He stepped to the back of the tree.\n\"Pardon me if I draw this uncomfortably tight.  I don’t think you\ncan reach around to the knot.  No?  The trunk is too large?  Quite\nso!”  He stepped around to face Markel again–the man was thoroughly\nfrightened, his face was livid, his jaw sagged weakly, and his eyes\nfollowed every movement of the revolver in Jimmie Dale’s hand in a\nsort of miserable fascination.  Jimmie Dale smiled unhappily.  “I am\ngoing to do something, Markel, that I should advise no other man to\ndo–I am going to put you on your honour!  For the next fifteen\nminutes you are not to utter a sound.  Do you understand?”",
        "“Y-yes,” said Markel hoarsely.",
        "“No,” said Jimmie Dale sadly, “I don’ think you do.  Let me be\npainfully explicit.  If you break your vow of silence by so much as\na second, then to-morrow, or the next day, or the day after, at my\nconvenience, Markel, you and I will meet again–for the LAST time.\nThere can be no possible misapprehension on your part now–Markel?”",
        "“N-no,\"–Markel could scarcely chatter out the word.",
        "“Quite so,” said Jimmie Dale, in velvet tones.  He stood for an\ninstant looking at the other with cool insolence; then: “Good-night,\nMarkel\"–and five minutes later a great touring car was tearing New\nYorkward over the Long Island roads at express speed.",
        "It was one o’clock in the morning as Jimmie Dale swung the car into\na cross street off lower Broadway, and drew up at the curb beside a\nlarge office building.  He got out, snuggled the cash box under his\nulster, went around to the Broadway entrance, glanced up to note\nthat a light burned in a fifth-story window, and entered the\nbuilding.",
        "The hallway was practically in darkness, one or two incandescents\nonly threw a dim light about.  Jimmie Dale stopped for a moment at\nthe foot of the stairs, beside the elevator well, to listen–if the\nwatchman was making rounds, it was in another part of the building\nJimmie Dale began to climb.",
        "He reached the fifth floor, turned down the corridor, and halted in\nfront of a door, through the ground-glass panel of which a light\nglowed faintly–as though coming from an inner office beyond.\nJimmie Dale drew the black silk mask from his pocket, adjusted it,\ntried the door, found it unlocked, opened it noiselessly, and\nstepped inside.  Across the room, through another door, half open,\nthe light streamed into the outer office, where Jimmie Dale stood.",
        "Jimmie Dale stole across the room, crouched by the door to look into\nthe inner office–and his face went suddenly rigid.",
        "“Good God!” he whispered.  “As bad as that!\"–but it was a\nnonchalant Jimmie Dale to all outward appearances that, on the\ninstant, stepped unconcernedly over the threshold.",
        "An elderly man, white-haired, kindly-faced, kindly-eyed, save now\nthat the face was drawn and haggard, the eyes full of weariness, was\nstanding behind a flat-topped desk, his fingers twitching nervously\non a revolver in his hand.  He whirled, with a startled cry, at\nJimmie Dale’s entrance, and the revolver clattered from his fingers\nto the floor.",
        "“I am afraid,” said Jimmie Dale, smiling pleasantly, “that you were\ngoing to shoot yourself.  Your name is Wilbur, Henry Wilbur, isn’t\nit?”",
        "Unmanned, trembling, the other stood–and nodded mechanically.",
        "“It’s really not a nice thing to do,” said Jimmie Dale\nconfidentially.  “Makes a mess, you see, too\"–he was pulling off\nhis motor gauntlet, his ulster, his jacket, and, having set the cash\nbox on the desk, was rolling back his sleeve as he spoke.  “Had a\nlittle experience myself this evening.”  He held out his hand that,\nwith the forearm, was covered with blood.  “A little above the\nwrist–fortunately only a flesh wound–a little memento from a chap\nnamed Markel, and–”",
        "“MARKEL!”  The word burst, quivering, from the other’s lips.",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale imperturbably.  “Do you mind if I wash a\nbit–and could you oblige me with a towel, or something that would\ndo for a bandage?”",
        "The man seemed dazed.  In a subconscious way, he walked from the\ndesk to a little cupboard, and took out two towels.",
        "Jimmie Dale stooped, while the other’s back was turned, picked up\nthe revolver from the floor, and slipped it into his trousers\npocket.",
        "“Markel?” said Wilbur again, the same trembling anxiety in his\nvoice, as he handed Jimmie Dale the towels and motioned toward a\nwashstand in the corner of the room.  “Did you say Markel–Theodore\nMarkel?”",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale, examining his wound critically.",
        "“You had trouble–a fight with him?  Is he–he–dead?”",
        "“No,” said Jimmie Dale, smiling a little grimly.  “ He’s pretty\nbadly hurt, though, I imagine–but not in a physical way.”",
        "“Strange!” whispered Wilbur, in a numbed tone to himself; and he\nwent back and sank down in his desk chair.  “Strange that you should\nspeak of Markel–strange that you should have come here to-night!”",
        "Jimmie Dale did not answer.  He glanced now and then at the other,\nas he deftly dressed his wrist–the man seemed on the verge of\ncollapse, on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  Jimmie Dale swore\nsoftly to himself.  Wilbur was too old a man to be called upon to\nstand against the trouble and anxiety that was mirrored in the\nmisery in his face, that had brought him to the point of taking his\nown life.",
        "Jimmie Dale put on his coat again, walked over to the desk, and\npicked up the ’phone.",
        "“If I may?” he inquired courteously–and confided a number to the\nmouthpiece of the instrument.",
        "There was a moment’s wait, during which Wilbur, in a desperate sort\nof way, seemed to be trying to rally himself, to piece together a\npuzzle, as it were; and for the first time he appeared to take a\npersonal interest in the masked figure that leaned against his desk.\nHe kept passing his hands across his eyes, staring at Jimmie Dale.",
        "Then Jimmie Dale spoke–into the ’phone.",
        "“MORNING NEWS-ARGUS office?  Mr. Carruthers, please.  Thank you.”",
        "Another wait–then Jimmie Dale’s voice changed its pitch and\nregister to a pleasant and natural, though quite unrecognisable\nbass.",
        "Mr. Carruthers?  Yes.  I thought it might interest you to know that\nMr. Theodore Markel purchased a very valuable diamond necklace this\nafternoon. . . .  Oh, you knew that, did you?  Well, so much the\nbetter; you’ll be all the more keenly interested to know that it is\nno longer in his possession. . . .  I beg pardon?  Oh, yes, I quite\nforgot–this is the Gray Seal speaking. . . .  Yes. . . .  The Gray\nSeal. . . .  I have just come from Mr. Markel’s country house, and\nif you hurry a man out there you ought to be able to give the public\nan exclusive bit of news, a scoop, I believe you call it–you see,\nMr. Carruthers, I am not ungrateful for, I might say, the eulogistic\nmanner in which the MORNING NEWS-ARGUS treated me in that last\naffair, and I trust I shall be able to do you many more favours–I\nam deeply in your debt.  And, oh, yes, tell your reporter not to\noverlook the detail of Mr. Markel in his pajamas and dressing gown\ntied to a tree in his park–Mr. Markel might be inclined to be\nreticent on that point, and it would be a pity to deprive the public\nof any–er–’atmosphere’ in the story, you know. . . .  What? . . .\nNo; I am afraid Mr. Markel’s ’phone is–er–out of order. . . .\nYes. . . .  And, by the way, speaking of ’phones, Mr. Carruthers,\nbetween gentlemen, I know you will make no effort under the\ncircumstances to discover the number I am calling from.  Good-night,\nMr. Carruthers.”  Jimmie Dale hung the receiver abruptly on the\nhook.",
        "“You see,” said Jimmie Dale, turning to Wilbur–and then he stopped.\nThe man was on his feet, swaying there, his face positively gray.",
        "“My God!” Wilbur burst out.  “What have you done?  A thousand times\nbetter if I had shot myself, as I would have done in another moment\nif you had not come in.  I was only ruined then–I am disgraced now.\nYou have robbed Markel’s safe–I am the one man in the world who\nwould have a reason above all others for doing that–and Markel\nknows it.  He will accuse me of it.  He can prove I had a motive.  I\nhave not been home to-night.  Nobody knows I am here.  I cannot\nprove an alibi.  What have you done!”",
        "“Really,” said Jimmie Dale, almost plaintively, swinging himself up\non the corner of the desk and taking the cash box on his knee,\n\"really, you are alarming yourself unnecessarily.  I–”",
        "But Wilbur stopped him.  “You don’t know what you are talking\nabout!” Wilbur cried out, in a choked way; then, his voice\nsteadying, he rushed on: “Listen!  I am a ruined man, absolutely\nruined.  And Markel has ruined me–I did not see through his trick\nuntil too late.  Listen!  For years, as a mining engineer, I made a\ngood salary–and I saved it.  Two years ago I had nearly seventy\nthousand dollars–it represented my life work.  I bought an\nabandoned mine in Alaska for next to nothing–I was certain it was\nrich.  A man by the name of Thurl, Jason T. Thurl, another mining\nengineer, a steamer acquaintance, was out there at the time–he was\na partner of Markel’s, though I didn’t know it then.  I started to\nwork the mine.  It didn’t pan out.  I dropped nearly every cent.\nThen I struck a small vein that temporarily recouped me, and\nsupplied the necessary funds with which to go ahead for a while.\nThurl, who had tried to buy the mine out from under my option in the\nfirst place, repeatedly then tried to buy it from me at a ridiculous\nfigure.  I refused.  He persisted.  I refused–I was confident, I\nKNEW I had one of the richest properties in Alaska.”",
        "Wilbur paused.  A little row of glistening drops had gathered on his\nforehead.  Jimmie Dale, balancing Markel’s cash box on one knee,\ndrummed softly with his finger tips on the cover.",
        "“The vein petered out,” Wilbur went on.  “But I was still confident.\nI sank all the proceeds of the first strike–and sank them fast, for\nunaccountable accidents that crippled me both financially and in the\nprogress of the work began to happen.”  Wilbur flung out his hands\nimpotently.  “Oh, it’s a long story–too long to tell.  Thurl was at\nthe bottom of those accidents.  He knew as well as I did that the\nmine was rich–better than I did, for that matter, for we discovered\nbefore we ran him out of Alaska that he had made secret borings on\nthe property.  But what I did not know until a few hours ago was\nthat he had actually uncovered what we uncovered only yesterday–the\nmother lode.  He was driving me as fast as he could into the last\nditch–for Markel.  I didn’t know until yesterday that Markel had\nany thing to do with it.  I struggled on out there, hoping every day\nto open a new vein.  I raised money on everything I had, except my\ninsurance and the mine–and sank it in the mine.  No one out there\nwould advance me anything on a property that looked like a failure,\nthat had once already been abandoned.  I have always kept an office\nhere, and I came back East with the idea of raising something on my\ninsurance.  Markel, quite by haphazard as I then thought, was\nintroduced to me just before we left San Francisco on our way to New\nYork.  On the run across the continent we became very friendly.\nNaturally, I told him my story.  He played sympathetic good fellow,\nand offered to lend me fifty thousand dollars on a demand note.  I\ndid not want to be involved for a cent more than was necessary, and,\nas I said, I hoped from day to day to make another strike.  I\nrefused to take more than ten thousand.  I remember now that he\nseemed strangely disappointed.”",
        "Again Wilbur stopped.  He swept the moisture from his forehead–and\nhis fist, clenched, came down upon the desk.",
        "“You see the game!\"–there was bitter anger in his voice now.  “You\nsee the game!  He wanted to get me in deep enough so that I couldn’t\nwriggle out, deeper than ten thousand that I could get at any time\non my insurance, he wanted me where I couldn’t get away–and he got\nme.  The first ten thousand wasn’t enough.  I went to him for a\nsecond, a third, a fourth, a fifth–hoping always that each would be\nthe last.  Each time a new note, a demand note for the total amount,\nwas made, cancelling the former one.  I didn’t know his game, didn’t\nsuspect it–I blessed God for giving me such a friend–until this,\nor, rather, yesterday afternoon, when I received a telegram from my\nmanager at the mine saying that he had struck what looked like a\nvery rich vein–the mother lode.  And\"–Wilbur’s fist curled until\nthe knuckles were like ivory in their whiteness–\"he added in the\ntelegram that Thurl had wired the news of the strike to a man in New\nYork by the name of Markel.  Do you see?  I hadn’t had the telegram\nfive minutes, when a messenger brought me a letter from Markel\ncurtly informing me that I would have to meet my note to-morrow\nmorning.  I can’t meet it.  He knew I couldn’t.  With wealth in\nsight–I’m wiped out.  A DEMAND note, a call loan, do you\nunderstand–and with a few months in which to develop the new vein I\ncould pay it readily.  As it is–I default the note–Markel attaches\nall I have left, which is the mine.  The mine is sold to satisfy my\nindebtedness.  Markel buys it in legally, upheld by the law–and\nacquires, ROBS me of it, and–”",
        "“And so,” said Jimmie Dale musingly, “you were going to shoot\nyourself?”",
        "Wilbur straightened up, and there was something akin to pathetic\ngrandeur in the set of the old shoulders as they squared back.",
        "“Yes!” he said, in a low voice.  “And shall I tell you why?  Even\nif, which is not likely, there was something reverting to me over\nthe purchase price, it would be a paltry thing compared with the\nmine.  I have a wife and children.  If I have worked for them all my\nlife, could I stand back now at the last and see them robbed of\ntheir inheritance by a black-hearted scoundrel when I could still\nlift a hand to prevent it!  I had one way left.  What is my life?  I\nam too old a man to cling to it where they are concerned.  I have\nreferred to my insurance several times.  I have always carried heavy\ninsurance\"–he smiled a little curious, mirthless smile–\"THAT HAS\nNO SUICIDE CLAUSE.”  He swept his hand over the desk, indicating the\npapers scattered there.  “I have worked late to-night getting my\naffairs in order.  My total insurance is fifty-two thousand dollars,\nthough I couldn’t BORROW anywhere near the full amount on it–but at\nmy death, paid in full, it would satisfy the note.  My executors, by\ninstruction would pay the note–and no dollar from the mine, no\nsingle grain of gold, not an ounce of quartz, would Markel ever get\nhis hands on, and my wife and children would be saved.  That is–”",
        "His words ended abruptly–with a little gasp.  Jimmie Dale had\nopened the cash box and was dangling the necklace under the light–a\nstream of fiery, flashing, sparkling gems.",
        "Then Wilbur spoke again, a hard, bitter note in his voice, pointing\nhis hand at the necklace.",
        "“But now, on top of everything, you have brought me disgrace–\nbecause you broke into his safe to-night for THAT?  He would and\nwill accuse me.  I have heard of you–the Gray Seal–you have done a\npitiful night’s work in your greed for that thing there.”",
        "“For this?” Jimmie Dale smiled ironically, holding the necklace up.\nThen he shook his head.  “I didn’t break into Markel’s safe for\nthis–it wouldn’t have been worth while.  It’s only paste.”",
        "“PASTE!” exclaimed Wilbur, in a slow way.",
        "“Paste,” said Jimmie Dale placidly, dropping the necklace back into\nits case.  “Quite in keeping with Markel, isn’t it–to make a\nsensation on the cheap?”",
        "“But that doesn’t change matters!” Wilbur cried out sharply, after a\nnumbed instant’s pause.  “You still broke into the safe, even if you\ndidn’t know then that the necklace was paste.”",
        "“Ah, but, you see–I did know then,” said Jimmie Dale softly.  “I am\nreally–you must take my word for it–a very good judge of stones,\nand I had–er–seen these before.”",
        "Wilbur stared–bewildered, confused.",
        "“Then why–what was it that–”",
        "“A paper,” said Jimmie Dale, with a little chuckle–and produced it\nfrom the cash box.  “It reads like this: ’On demand, I promise to\npay–’”",
        "“My note!”  It came in a great, surging cry from Wilbur; and he\nstrained forward to read it.",
        "“Of course,” said Jimmie Dale.  “Of course–your note.  Did you\nthink that I had just happened to drop in on you?  Now, then, see\nhere, you just buck up, and–er–smile.  There isn’t even a\npossibility of you being accused of the theft.  In the first place,\nMarkel saw quite enough of me to know that it wasn’t you.  Secondly,\nneither Markel nor any one else would ever dream that the break was\nmade for anything else but the necklace, with which you have no\nconnection–the papers were in the cash box and were just taken\nalong with it.  Don’t you see?  And, besides, the police, with my\nvery good friend, Carruthers at their elbows, will see very\nthoroughly to it that the Gray Seal gets full and ample credit for\nthe crime.  But\"–Jimmie Dale pulled out his watch, and yawned under\nhis mask–\"it’s getting to be an unconscionable hour–and you’ve\nstill a letter to write.”",
        "“A letter?”  Wilbur’s voice was broken, his lips quivering.",
        "“To Markel,” said Jimmie Dale pleasantly.  “Write him in reply to\nhis letter of the afternoon, and post it before you leave here–just\nas though you had written it at once, promptly, on receipt of his.\nHe will still get it on the morning delivery.  State that you will\ntake up the note immediately on presentation at whatever bank he\nchooses to name.  That’s all.  Seeing that he hasn’t got it, he\ncan’t very well present it–can he?  Eventually, having–er–no use\nfor fake diamonds, I shall return the necklace, together with the\npapers in his cash box here–including your note.”",
        "“Eventually?”  Uncomprehendingly, stumblingly, Wilbur repeated the\nword.",
        "“In a month or two or three, as the case may be,” explained Jimmie\nDale brightly.  “Whenever you insert a personal in the NEWS-ARGUS to\nthe effect that the mother lode has given you the cash to meet it.\"\nHe replaced the note in the cash box, slipped down to his feet from\nthe desk–and then he choked a little.  Wilbur, the tears streaming\ndown his face, unable to speak, was holding out his hands to Jimmie\nDale.  “I–er–good-night!” said Jimmie Dale hurriedly–and stepped\nquickly from the room.",
        "Halfway down the first flight of stairs he paused.  Steps, running\nafter him, sounded along the corridor above; and then Wilbur’s\nvoice.",
        "“Don’t go–not yet,” cried the old man.  “I don’t understand.  How\ndid you know–who told you about the note?”",
        "Jimmie Dale did not answer–he went on noiselessly down the stairs.\nHis mask was off now, and his lips curved into a strange little\nsmile.",
        "“I wish I knew,” said Jimmie Dale wistfully to himself.",
        "It was still early in the evening, but a little after nine o’clock.\nThe Fifth Avenue bus wended its way, jouncing its patrons,\nparticularly those on the top seats, across town, and turned into\nRiverside Drive.  A short distance behind the bus, a limousine\nrolled down the cross street leisurely, silently.",
        "As the lights of passing craft on the Hudson and a myriad\nscintillating, luminous points dotting the west shore came into\nview, Jimmie Dale rose impulsively from his seat on the top of the\nbus, descended the little circular iron ladder at the rear, and\ndropped off into the street.  It was only a few blocks farther to\nhis residence on the Drive, and the night was well worth the walk;\nbesides, restless, disturbed, and perplexed in mind, the walk\nappealed to him.",
        "He stepped across to the sidewalk and proceeded slowly along.  A\nmonth had gone by and he had not heard a word from–HER.  The break\non West Broadway, the murder of Metzer in Moriarty’s gambling hell,\nthe theft of Markel’s diamond necklace had followed each other in\nquick succession–and then this month of utter silence, with no sign\nof her, as though indeed she had never existed.",
        "But it was not this temporary silence on her part that troubled\nJimmie Dale now.  In the years that he had worked with this unknown,\nmysterious accomplice of his whom he had never seen, there had been\nlonger intervals than a bare month in which he had heard nothing\nfrom her–it was not that.  It was the failure, total, absolute, and\ncomplete, that was the only result for the month of ceaseless,\nunremitting, doggedly-expended effort, even as it had been the\nresult many times before, in an attempt to solve the enigma that was\nso intimate and vital a factor in his own life.",
        "If he might lay any claims to cleverness, his resourcefulness, at\nleast, he was forced to admit, was no match for hers.  She came, she\nwent without being seen–and behind her remained, instead of clews\nto her identity, only an amazing, intangible mystery, that left him\nat times appalled and dismayed.  How did she know about those\nconditions in West Broadway, how did she know about Metzer’s murder,\nhow did she know about Markel and Wilbur–how did she know about a\nhundred other affairs of the same sort that had happened since that\nnight, years ago now, when out of pure adventure he had tampered\nwith Marx’s, the jeweller’s strong room in Maiden Lane, and she had,\nmysteriously then, too, solved HIS identity, discovered him to be\nthe Gray Seal?",
        "Jimmie Dale, wrapped up in his own thoughts, entirely oblivious to\nhis surroundings, traversed another block.  There had never been\nsince the world began, and there would never be again, so singular\nand bizarre a partnership as this–of hers and his.  He, Jimmie\nDale, with his strange double life, one of New York’s young bachelor\nmillionaires, one whose social status was unquestioned; and she,\nwho–who WHAT?  That was just it!  Who what?  What was she?  What\nwas her name?  What one personal, intimate thing did he know about\nher?  And what was to be the end?  Not that he would have severed\nhis association with her–not for worlds!–though every time, that,\nby some new and curious method, one of her letters found its way\ninto his hands, outlining some fresh coup for him to execute, his\nperil and danger of discovery was increased in staggering ratio.\nTo-day, the police hunted the Gray Seal as they hunted a mad dog;\nthe papers stormed and raved against him: in every detective bureau\nof two continents he was catalogued as the most notorious criminal\nof the age–and yet, strange paradox, no single crime had ever been\ncommitted!",
        "Jimmie Dale’s strong, fine-featured face lighted up.  Crime!  Thanks\nto her, there were those who blessed the name of the Gray Seal,\nthose into whose lives had come joy, relief from misery, escape from\ndeath even–and their blessings were worth a thousandfold the risk\nand peril of disaster that threatened him at every minute of the\nday.",
        "“Thank God for her!” murmured Jimmie Dale softly.  “But–but if I\ncould only find her, see her, know who she is, talk to her, and hear\nher voice!”  Then he smiled a little wanly.  “It’s been a pretty\ntough month–and nothing to show for it!”",
        "It had!  It had been one of the hardest months through which Jimmie\nDale had ever lived.  The St. James, that most exclusive club, his\nfavourite haunt, had seen nothing of him; the easel in his den, that\nwas his hobby, had been untouched; there had been days even when he\nhad not crossed the threshold of his home.  Every resource at his\ncommand he had called into play in an effort to solve the mystery.\nFor nearly the entire month, following first this lead and then\nthat, he had lived in the one disguise that he felt confident she\nknew nothing of–that was, or, rather, had become, almost a dual\npersonality with him.  From the Sanctuary, that miserable and\ndisreputable room in a tenement on the East Side, a tenement that\nhad three separate means of entrance and exit, he had emerged day\nafter day as Larry the Bat, a character as well known and as well\nliked in the exclusive circles of the underworld as was Jimmie Dale\nin the most exclusive strata of New York’s society and fashion.  And\nit had been useless–all useless.  Through his own endeavours,\nthrough the help of his friends of the underworld, the lives of half\na dozen men, Bert Hagan’s on West Broadway, for instance, Markel’s,\nand others’, had been laid bare to the last shred, but nowhere could\nbe found the one vital point that linked their lives with hers, that\nwould account for her intimate knowledge of them, and so furnish him\nwith the clew that would then with certainty lead him to a solution\nof her identity.",
        "It was baffling, puzzling, unbelievable, bordering, indeed, on the\nmiraculous–herself, everything about her, her acts, her methods,\nher cleverness, intangible in one sense, were terrifically real in\nanother.  Jimmie Dale shook his head.  The miraculous and this\npractical, everyday life were wide and far apart.  There was nothing\nmiraculous about it–it was only that the key to it was, so far,\nbeyond his reach.",
        "And then suddenly Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders in consonance\nwith a whimsical change in both mood and thought.",
        "“Larry the Bat, is a hard taskmaster!” he muttered facetiously.\n\"I’m afraid I’m not very presentable this evening–no bath this\nmorning, and no shave, and, after nearly a month of make-up, that\nbeastly grease paint gets into the skin creases in a most intimate\nway.”  He chuckled as the thought of old Jason, his butler, came to\nhim.  “I saw Jason, torn between two conflicting emotions, shaking\nhis head over the black circles under my eyes last night–he didn’t\nknow whether to worry over the first signs of a galloping decline,\nor break his heart at witnessing the young master he had dandled on\nhis knees going to the damnation bowwows and turning into a\nconfirmed roue!  I guess I’ll have to mind myself, though.  Even\nCarruthers detached his mind far enough from his editorial desk and\nthe hope of exclusively publishing the news of the Gray Seal’s\ncapture in the MORNING NEWS-ARGUS, to tell me I was looking seedy.\nIt’s wonderful the way a little paint will metamorphose a man!\nWell, anyway, here’s for a good hot tub to-night, and a fresh start!",
        "He quickened his pace.  There were still three blocks to go, and\nhere was no hurrying, jostling crowd to impede his progress; indeed,\nas far as he could see up the Drive, there was not a pedestrian in\nsight.  And then, as he walked, involuntarily, insistently, his mind\nharked back into the old groove again.",
        "“I’ve tried to picture her,” said Jimmie Dale softly to himself.\n\"I’ve tried to picture her a hundred, yes, a thousand times, and–”",
        "A bus, rumbling cityward, went by him, squeaking, creaking, and\nrattling in its uneasy joints–and out of the noise, almost at his\nelbow it seemed, a voice spoke his name–and in that instant\nintuitively he KNEW, and it thrilled him, stopped the beat of his\nheart, as, dulcet, soft, clear as the note of a silver bell it fell–\nand only one word:",
        "“Jimmie!”",
        "He whirled around.  A limousine, wheels just grazing the curb, was\ngliding slowly and silently past him, and from the window a woman’s\narm, white-gloved and dainty, was extended, and from the fingers to\nthe pavement fluttered an envelope–and the car leaped forward.",
        "For the fraction of a second, Jimmie Dale stood dazed, immovable, a\ngamut of emotions, surprise, fierce exultation, amazement, a strange\njoy, a mighty uplift, swirling upon him–and then, snatching up the\nenvelope from the ground, he sprang out into the road after the car.\nIt was the one chance he had ever had, the one chance she had ever\ngiven him, and he had seen–a white-gloved arm!  He could not reach\nthe car, it was speeding away from him like an arrow now, but there\nwas something else that would do just as well, something that with\nall her cleverness she had overlooked–the car’s number dangling on\nthe rear axle, the rays of the little lamp playing on the enamelled\nsurface of the plate!  Gasping, panting, he held his own for a yard\nor more, and there floated back to him a little silvery laugh from\nthe body of the limousine, and then Jimmie Dale laughed, too, and\nstopped–it was No.15,836!",
        "He stood and watched the car disappear up the Drive.  What delicious\nirony!  A month of gruelling, ceaseless toil that had been vain,\nfutile, useless–and the key, when he was not looking for it,\nunexpectedly, through no effort of his, was thrust into his hand–\nNo.15,836!",
        "Jimmie Dale, the gently ironic smile still on his lips, those slim,\nsupersensitive fingers of his subconsciously noting that the texture\nof the envelope was the same as she always used, retraced his steps\nto the sidewalk.",
        "“Number fifteen thousand eight hundred and thirty-six,” said Jimmie\nDale aloud–and halted at the curb as though rooted to the spot.  It\nsounded strangely familiar, that number!  He repeated it over again\nslowly: “One-five-eight-three-six.”  And the smile left his lips,\nand upon his face came the look of a chastened child.  She had used\na duplicate plate!  Fifteen thousand eight hundred and thirty-six\nwas the number of one of his own cars–his own particular runabout!",
        "For a moment longer he stood there, undecided whether to laugh or\nswear, and then his eyes fastened mechanically on the envelope he\nwas twirling in his fingers.  Here, at least, was something that was\nnot elusive; that, on the contrary, as a hundred others in the past\nhad done, outlined probably a grim night’s work ahead for the Gray\nSeal!  And, if it were as those others had been, every minute from\nthe moment of its receipt was precious time.  He stepped under the\nnearest street light, and tore the envelope open.",
        "“Dear Philanthropic Crook,” it began–and then followed two closely\nwritten pages.  Jimmie Dale read them, his lips growing gradually\ntighter, a smouldering light creeping into his dark eyes, and once\nhe emitted a short, low whistle of consternation–that was at the\nend, as he read the post-script that was heavily underscored: “Work\nquickly.  They will raid to-night.  Be careful.  Look out for Kline,\nhe is the sharpest man in the United States secret service.”",
        "For a brief instant longer, Jimmie Dale stood under the street lamp,\nhis mind in a lightning-quick way cataloguing every point in her\nletter, viewing every point from a myriad angles, constructing,\ndevising, mapping out a plan to dove-tail into them–and then Jimmie\nDale swung on a downtown bus.  There was neither time nor occasion\nto go home now–that marvellous little kit of burglar’s tools that\npeeped from their tiny pockets in that curious leather undervest,\nand that reposed now in the safe in his den, would be useless to him\nto-night; besides, in the breast pocket of his coat, neatly folded,\nwas a black silk mask, and, relics of his role of Larry the Bat, an\nautomatic revolver, an electric flashlight, a steel jimmy, and a\nbunch of skeleton keys, were distributed among the other pockets of\nhis smart tweed suit.",
        "Jimmie Dale changed from the bus to the subway, leaving behind him,\nstrewn over many blocks, the tiny and minute fragments into which he\nhad torn her letter; at Astor Place he left the subway, walked to\nBroadway, turned uptown for a block to Eighth Street, then along\nEighth Street almost to Sixth Avenue–and stopped.",
        "A rather shabby shop, a pitiful sort of a place, displaying in its\nwindow a heterogeneous conglomeration of cheap odds and ends, ink\nbottles, candy, pencils, cigarettes, pens, toys, writing pads,\nmarbles, and a multitude of other small wares, confronted him.\nWithin, a little, old, sweet-faced, gray-haired woman stood behind\nthe counter, pottering over the rearrangement of some articles on\nthe shelves.",
        "“My word!” said Jimmie Dale softly to himself.  “You wouldn’t\nbelieve it, would you!  And I’ve always wondered how these little\nstores managed to make both ends meet.  Think of that old soul\nmaking fifteen or twenty thousand dollars from a layout like this–\neven if it has taken her a lifetime!”",
        "Jimmie Dale had halted nonchalantly and unconcernedly by the curb,\nnot too near the window, busied apparently in an effort to light a\nrefractory cigarette; and then, about to enter the store, he gazed\naimlessly across the street for a moment instead.  A man came\nbriskly around the corner from Sixth Avenue, opened the store door,\nand went in.",
        "Jimmie Dale drew back a little, and turned his head again as the\ndoor closed–and a sudden, quick, alert, and startled look spread\nover his face.",
        "The man who had entered bent over the counter and spoke to the old\nlady.  She seemed to listen with a dawning terror creeping over her\nfeatures, and then her hands went piteously to the thin hair behind\nher ears.  The man motioned toward a door at the rear of the store.\nShe hesitated, then came out from behind the counter, and swayed a\nlittle as though her limbs would not support her weight.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s lips thinned.",
        "“I’m afraid,” he muttered slowly, “I’m afraid that I’m too late even\nnow.”  And then, as she came to the door and turned the key on the\ninside: “Pray Heaven she doesn’t turn the light out–or somebody\nmight think I was trying to break in!”",
        "But in that respect Jimmie Dale’s fears were groundless.  She did\nnot turn out either of the gas jets that lighted the little shop;\ninstead, in a faltering, reluctant sort of manner, she led the way\ndirectly through the door in the rear, and the man followed her.",
        "The shop was empty–and Jimmie Dale was standing against the door on\nthe outside.  His position was perfectly natural–a hundred passers-\nby would have noted nothing but a most commonplace occurrence–a man\nin the act of entering a store.  And, if he appeared to fumble and\nhave trouble with the latch, what of it!  Jimmie Dale, however, was\nnot fumbling–hidden by his back that was turned to the street,\nthose wonderful fingers of his, in whose tips seemed embodied and\nconcentrated every one of the human senses, were working quickly,\nsurely, accurately, without so much as the wasted movement of a\nsingle muscle.",
        "A faint tinkle–and the key within fell from the lock to the floor.\nA faint click–and the bolt of the lock slipped back.  Jimmie Dale\nrestored the skeleton keys and a little steel instrument that\naccompanied them to his pocket–and quietly opened the door.  He\nstepped inside, picked up the key from the floor, inserted it in the\nlock, closed the door behind him, and locked it again.",
        "“To guard against interruption,” observed Jimmie Dale, a little\nquizzically.",
        "He was, perhaps, thirty seconds behind the others.  He crossed the\nshop noiselessly, cautiously, and passed through the door at the\nrear.  It opened into a short passage that, after a few feet, gave\non a sort of corridor at right angles–and down this latter, facing\nhim, at the end, the door of a lighted room was open, and he could\nsee the figure of the man who had entered the shop, back turned,\nstanding on the threshold.  Voices, indistinct, came to him.",
        "The corridor itself was dark; and Jimmie Dale, satisfied that he was\nfairly safe from observation, stole softly forward.  He passed two\ndoors on his left–and the curious arrangement of the building that\nhad puzzled him for a moment became clear.  The store made the front\nof an old tenement building, with apartments above, and the rear of\nthe store was a sort of apartment, too–the old lady’s living\nquarters.",
        "Step by step, testing each one against a possible creaking of the\nfloor, Jimmie Dale moved forward, keeping close up against one wall.\nThe man passed on into the room–and now Jimmie Dale could\ndistinguish every word that was being spoken; and, crouched up, in\nthe dark corridor, in the angle of the wall and the door jamb\nitself, could see plainly enough into the room beyond.  Jimmie\nDale’s jaw crept out a little.",
        "A young man, gaunt, pale, wrapped in blankets, half sat, half\nreclined in an invalid’s chair; the old lady, on her knees, the\ntears streaming down her face, had her arms around the sick man’s\nneck; while the other man, apparently upset at the scene, tugged\nvigorously at long, gray mustaches.",
        "“Sammy!  Sammy!” sobbed the woman piteously.  “Say you didn’t do it,\nSammy–say you didn’t do it!”",
        "Look here, Mrs. Matthews,” said the man with the gray mustaches\ngently, “now don’t you go to making things any harder.  I’ve got to\ndo my duty just the same, and take your son.”",
        "The young man, a hectic flush beginning to burn on his cheeks, gazed\nwildly from one to the other.",
        "“What–what is it?” he cried out.",
        "The man threw back his coat and displayed a badge on his vest.",
        "“I’m Kline of the secret service,” he said gravely.  “I’m sorry,\nSammy, but I want you for that little job in Washington at the\nbureau–before you left on sick leave!”",
        "Sammy Matthews struggled away from his mother’s arms, pulled himself\nforward in his chair–and his tongue licked dry lips.",
        "“What–what job?” he whispered thickly.",
        "“You know, don’t you?” the other answered steadily.  He took a\nlarge, flat pocketbook from his pocket, opened it, and took out a\nfive-dollar bill.  He held this before the sick man’s eyes, but just\nout of reach, one finger silently indicating the lower left-hand\ncorner.",
        "Matthews stared at it for a moment, and the hectic flush faded to a\ngrayish pallor, and a queer, impotent sound gurgled in his throat.",
        "“I see you recognise it,” said the other quietly.  “It’s open and\nshut, Sammy.  That little imperfection in the plate’s got you, my\nboy.”",
        "“Sammy!  Sammy!” sobbed the woman again.  “Sammy, say you didn’t do\nit!”",
        "“It’s a lie!” said Matthews hoarsely.  “It’s a lie!  That plate was\ncondemned in the bureau for that imperfection–condemned and\ndestroyed.”",
        "“Condemned TO BE destroyed,” corrected the other, without raising\nhis voice.  “There’s a little difference there, Sammy–about twenty\nyears’ difference–in the Federal pen.  But it wasn’t destroyed;\nthis note was printed from it by one of the slickest gangs of\ncounterfeiters in the United States–but I don’t need to tell you\nthat, I guess you know who they are.  I’ve been after them a long\ntime, and I’ve got them now, just as tight as I’ve got you.  Instead\nof destroying that plate, you stole it, and disposed of it to the\ngang.  How much did they give you?”",
        "Matthews’ face seemed to hold a dumb horror, and his fingers picked\nat the arms of the chair.  His mother had moved from beside him now,\nand both her hands were patting at the man’s sleeve in a pitiful\nway, while again and again she tried to speak, but no words would\ncome.",
        "“It’s a lie!” said Matthews again, in a colourless, mechanical way.",
        "The man glanced at Mrs. Matthews as he put the five-dollar note back\ninto his pocket, seemed to choke a little, shook his head, and all\ntrace of the official sternness that had crept into his voice\ndisappeared.",
        "“It’s no good,” he said in a low tone.  “Don’t do that, Mrs.\nMatthews, I’ve got to do my duty.”  He leaned a little toward the\nchair.  “It’s dead to rights, Sammy.  You might as well make a clean\nbreast of it.  It was up to you and Al Gregor to see that the plate\nwas destroyed.  It WASN’T destroyed; instead, it shows up in the\nhands of a gang of counterfeiters that I’ve been watching for\nmonths.  Furthermore, I’ve got the plate itself.  And finally,\nthough I haven’t placed him under arrest yet for fear you might hear\nof it before I wanted you to and make a get-away, I’ve got Al Gregor\nwhere I can put my hands on him, and I’ve got his confession that\nyou and he worked the game between you to get that plate out of the\nbureau and dispose of it to the gang.”",
        "“Oh, my God!\"–it came in a wild cry from the sick man, and in a\ndesperate, lurching way he struggled up to his feet.  “Al Gregor\nsaid that?  Then–then I’m done!”  He clutched at his temples.  “But\nit’s not true–it’s not true!  If the plate was stolen, and it must\nhave been stolen, or that note wouldn’t have been found, it was Al\nGregor who stole it–I didn’t, I tell you!  I knew nothing of it,\nexcept that he and I were responsible for it and–and I left it to\nhim–that’s the only way I’m to blame.  He’s caught, and he’s trying\nto get out of it with a light sentence by pretending to turn State’s\nevidence, but–but I’ll fight him–he can’t prove it–it’s only his\nword against mine, and–”",
        "The other shook his head again.",
        "“It’s no good, Sammy,” he said, a touch of sternness back in his\ntones again.  “I told you it was open and shut.  It’s not only Al\nGregor.  One of the gang got weak knees when I got him where I\nwanted him the other night, and he swears that you are the one who\nDELIVERED the plate to them.  Between him and Gregor and what I know\nmyself, I’ve got evidence enough for any jury against every one of\nthe rest of you.”",
        "Horror, fear, helplessness seemed to mingle in the sick man’s\nstaring eyes, and he swayed unsteadily upon his feet.",
        "“I’m innocent!” he screamed out.  “But I’m caught, I’m caught in a\nnet, and I can’t get out–they lied to you–but no one will believe\nit any more than you do and–and it means twenty years for me–oh,\nGod!–twenty years,  and–”  His hands went wriggling to his temples\nagain, and he toppled back in a faint into the chair.",
        "“You’ve killed him!  You’ve killed my boy!” the old lady shrieked\nout piteously, and flung herself toward the senseless figure.",
        "The man jumped for the table across the room, on which was a row of\nbottles, snatched one up, drew the cork, smelled it, and ran back\nwith the bottle.  He poured a little of the contents into his cupped\nhand, held it under young Matthews’ nostrils, and pushed the bottle\ninto Mrs. Matthews’ hands.",
        "“Bathe his forehead with this, Mrs. Matthews,” he directed\nreassuringly.  “He’ll be all right again in a moment.  There, see–\nhe’s coming around now.”",
        "There was a long, fluttering sigh, and Matthews opened his eyes;\nthen a moment’s silence; and then he spoke, with an effort, with\nlong pauses between the words:",
        "“Am–I–to–go–now?”",
        "The words seemed to ring absolute terror in the old lady’s ears.\nShe turned, and dropped to her knees on the floor.",
        "“Mr. Kline, Mr. Kline,” she sobbed out, “oh, for God’s love, don’t\ntake him!  Let him off, let him go!  He’s my boy–all I’ve got!\nYou’ve got a mother, haven’t you?  You know–”  The tears were\nstreaming down the sweet, old face again.  “Oh, won’t you, for God’s\ndear name, won’t you let him go?  Won’t–”",
        "“Stop!” the man cried huskily.  He was mopping at his face with his\nhandkerchief.  “I thought I was case-hardened, I ought to be–but I\nguess I’m not.  But I’ve got to do my duty.  You’re only making it\nworse for Sammy there, as well as me.”",
        "Her arms were around his knees now, clinging there.",
        "“Why can’t you let him off!” she pleaded hysterically.  “Why can’t\nyou!  Why can’t you!  Nobody would know, and I’d do anything–I’d\npay anything–anything–I’ll give you ten–fifteen thousand\ndollars!”",
        "“My poor woman,” he said kindly, placing his hand on her head, “you\nare talking wildly.  Apart altogether from the question of duty,\neven if I succeeded in hushing the matter up, I would probably at\nleast be suspected and certainly discharged, and I have a family to\nsupport–and if I were caught I’d get ten years in the Federal\nprison for it.  I’m sorry for this; I believe it’s your boy’s first\noffence, and if I could let him off I would.”",
        "“But you can–you can!” she burst out, rocking on her knees,\nclinging tighter still to him, as though in a paroxysm of fear that\nhe might somehow elude her.  “It will kill him–it will kill my boy.\nAnd you can save him!  And even if they discharged you, what would\nthat mean against my boy’s life!  You wouldn’t suffer, your family\nwouldn’t suffer, I’ll–I’ll take care of that–perhaps I could raise\na little more than fifteen thousand–but, oh, have pity, have mercy–\ndon’t take him away!”",
        "The man stared at her a moment, stared at the white face on the\nreclining chair–and passed his hand heavily across his eyes.",
        "“You will!  You will!”  It came in a great surging cry of joy from\nthe old lady.  “You will–oh, thank God, thank God!–I can see it in\nyour face!”",
        "“I–I guess I’m soft,” he said huskily, and stooped and raised Mrs.\nMatthews to her feet.  “Don’t cry any more.  It’ll be all right–\nit’ll be all right.  I’ll–I’ll fix it up somehow.  I haven’t made\nany arrests yet, and–well, I’ll take my chances.  I’ll get the\nplate and turn it over to you to-morrow, only–only it’s got to be\ndestroyed in my presence.”",
        "“Yes, yes!” she cried, trying to smile through her tears–and then\nshe flung her arms around her son’s neck again.  “And when you come\nto-morrow, I’ll be ready with the money to do my share, too, and–”",
        "But Sammy Matthews shook his head.",
        "“You’re wrong, both of you,” he said weakly.  “You’re a white man,\nKline.  But destroying that plate won’t save me.  The minute a\nsingle note printed from it shows up, they’ll know back there in\nWashington that the plate was stolen, and–”",
        "“No; you’re safe enough there,” the other interposed heavily.\n\"Knowing what was up, you don’t think I’d give the gang a chance to\nget them into circulation, do you?  I got them all when I got the\nplate.  And\"–he smiled a little anxiously–\"I’ll bring them here to\nbe destroyed with the plate.  It would finish me now, as well as\nyou, if one of them ever showed up.  Say,” he said suddenly, with a\ncatch in his breath, “I–I don’t think I know what I’m doing.”",
        "Mrs. Matthews reached out her hands to him.",
        "“What can I say to you!” she said brokenly, “What–”",
        "Jimmie Dale drew back along the wall.  A little way from the door he\nquickened his pace, still moving, however, with extreme caution.\nThey were still talking behind him as he turned from the corridor\ninto the passageway leading to the store, and from there into the\nstore itself.  And then suddenly, in spite of caution, his foot\nslipped on the bare floor.  It was not much–just enough to cause\nhis other foot, poised tentatively in air, to come heavily down, and\na loud and complaining creak echoed from the floor.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s jaws snapped like a steel trap.  From down the\ncorridor came a sudden, excited exclamation in the little old lady’s\nvoice, and then her steps sounded running toward the store.  In the\nfraction of a second Jimmie Dale was at the front door.",
        "“Clumsy, blundering fool!” he whispered fiercely to himself as he\nturned the key, opened the door noiselessly until it was just ajar,\nand turned the key in the lock again, leaving the bolt protruding\nout.  One step backward, and he was rapping on the counter with his\nknuckles.  “Isn’t anybody here?” he called out loudly.  “Isn’t any–\noh!\"–as Mrs. Matthews appeared in the back doorway.  “A package of\ncigarettes, please.”",
        "She stared at him, a little frightened, her eyes red and swollen\nwith recent crying.",
        "“How–how did you get in here?” she asked tremendously.",
        "“I beg your pardon?” inquired Jimmie Dale, in polite surprise.",
        "“I–I locked the door–I’m sure I did,” she said, more to herself\nthan to Jimmie Dale, and hurried across the floor to the door as she\nspoke.",
        "Jimmie Dale, still politely curious, turned to watch her.  For a\nmoment bewilderment and a puzzled look were in her face–and then a\nsort of surprised relief.",
        "“I must have turned the key in the lock without shutting the door\ntight,” she explained, “for I knew I turned the key.”",
        "Jimmie Dale bent forward to examine the lock–and nodded.",
        "“Yes,” he agreed, with a smile.  “I should say so.”  Then, gravely\ncourteous: “I’m sorry to have intruded.”",
        "“It is nothing,” she answered; and, evidently anxious to be rid of\nhim, moved quickly around behind the counter.  “What kind of\ncigarettes do you want?”",
        "“Egyptians–any kind,” said Jimmie Dale, laying a bill on the\ncounter.",
        "He pocketed the cigarettes and his change, and turned to the door.",
        "“Good-evening,” he said pleasantly–and went out.",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled a little curiously, a little tolerantly.  As he\nstarted along the street, he heard the door of the little shop close\nwith a sort of supercareful bang, the key turned, and the latch\nrattle to try the door–the little old lady was bent on making no\nmistake a second time!",
        "And then the smile left Jimmie Dale’s lips, his face grew strained\nand serious, and he broke into a run down the block to Sixth Avenue.\nHere he paused for an instant–there was the elevated, the surface\ncars–which would be the quicker?  He looked up the avenue.  There\nwas no train coming; the nearest surface car was blocks away.  He\nbit his lips in vexation–and then with a jump he was across the\nstreet and hailing a passing taxicab that his eyes had just lighted\non.",
        "“Got a fare?” called Jimmie Dale.",
        "“No, sir,” answered the chauffeur, bumping his car to an abrupt\nhalt.",
        "“Good!” Jimmie Dale ran alongside, and yanked the door open.  “Do\nyou know where the Palace Saloon on the Bowery is?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” replied the man.",
        "Jimmie Dale held a ten-dollar bank note up before the chauffeur’s\neyes.",
        "“Earn that in four minutes, then,” he snapped–and sprang into the\ncab.",
        "The taxicab swerved around on little better than two wheels, started\non a mad dash down the Avenue–and Jimmie Dale braced himself grimly\nin his seat.  The cab swerved again, tore across Waverly Place,\ncircuited Washington Square, crossed Broadway, and whirled finally\ninto the upper end of the Bowery.",
        "Jimmie Dale spoke once–to himself–plaintively.",
        "“It’s too bad I can’t let old Carruthers in on this for a scoop with\nhis precious MORNING NEWS-ARGUS–but if I get out of it alive\nmyself, I’ll do well!  Wonder if the day’ll ever come when he finds\nout that his very dear friend and old college pal, Jimmie Dale, is\nthe Gray Seal that he’s turned himself inside out for about four\nyears now to catch, and that he’d trade his soul with the devil any\ntime to lay hands on!  Good old Carruthers!  ’The most puzzling,\nbewildering, delightful crook in the annals of crime’–am I?”",
        "The cab drew up at the curb.  Jimmie Dale sprang out, shoved the\nbill into the chauffeur’s hand, stepped quickly across the sidewalk,\nand pushed his way through the swinging doors of the Palace Saloon.\nInside leisurely and nonchalantly, he walked down past the length of\nthe bar to a door at the rear.  This opened into a passageway that\nled to the side entrance of the saloon on the cross street.  Jimmie\nDale emerged from the side entrance, crossed the street, retraced\nhis steps to the Bowery, crossed over, and walked rapidly down that\nthoroughfare for two blocks.  Here he turned east into the cross\nstreet; and here, once more, his pace became leisurely and\nunhurried.",
        "“It’s a strange coincidence, though possibly a very happy one,” said\nJimmie Dale, as he walked along, “that it should be on the same\nstreet as the Sanctuary–ah, this ought to be the place!”",
        "An alleyway, corresponding to the one that flanked the tenement\nwhere, as Larry the Bat, he had paid room rent as a tenant for\nseveral years, in fact, the alleyway next above it, and but a short\nblock away, intersected the street, narrow, black, and uninviting.\nJimmie Dale, as he passed, peered down its length.",
        "“No light–that’s good!” commented Jimmie Dale to himself.  Then:\n\"Window opens on alleyway ten feet from ground–shoe store, Russian\nJew, in basement–go in front door–straight hallway–room at end–\nRussian Jew probably accomplice–be careful that he does not hear\nyou moving overhead\"–Jimmie Dale’s mind, with that curious faculty\nof his, was subconsciously repeating snatches from her letter word\nfor word, even as he noted the dimly lighted, untidy, and disorderly\ninterior of what, from strings of leather slippers that decorated\nthe cellarlike entrance, was evidently a cheap and shoddy shoe store\nin the basement of the building.",
        "The building itself was rickety and tumble-down, three stories high,\nand given over undoubtedly to gregarious foreigners of the poorer\nclass, a rabbit burrow, as it were, having a multitude of roomers\nand lodgers.  There was nothing ominous or even secretive about it–\nup the short flight of steps to the entrance, even the door hung\ncarelessly half open.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s slouch hat was pulled a little farther down over his\neyes as he mounted the steps and entered the hallway.  He listened a\nmoment.  A sort of subdued, querulous hubbub seemed to hum through\nthe place, as voices, men’s, women’s, and children’s, echoing out\nfrom their various rooms above, mingled together, and floated down\nthe stairways in a discordant medley.  Jimmie Dale stepped lightly\ndown the length of the hall–and listened again; this time intently,\nwith his ear to the keyhole of the door that made the end of the\npassage.  There was not a sound from within.  He tried the door,\nsmiled a little as he reached for his keys, worked over the lock–\nand straightened up suddenly as his ear caught a descending step on\nthe stairs.  It was two flights up, however–and the door was\nunlocked now.  Jimmie Dale opened it, and, like a shadow, slipped\ninside; and, as he locked the door behind him, smiled once more–the\ndoor lock was but a paltry makeshift at best, but INSIDE his fingers\nhad touched a massive steel bolt that, when shot home, would yield\nwhen the door itself yielded–and not before.  Without moving the\nbolt, he turned–and his flashlight for a moment swept the room.",
        "“Not much like the way they describe this sort of place in\nstorybooks!” murmured Jimmie Dale capriciously.  “But I get the\nidea.  Mr. Russian Jew downstairs makes a bluff at using it for a\nstoreroom.”",
        "Again the flashlight made a circuit.  Here, there, and everywhere,\nseemingly without any attempt at order, were piles of wooden\nshipping cases.  Only the centre of the room was clear and empty;\nthat, and a vacant space against the wall by the window.",
        "Jimmie Dale, moving without sound, went to the window.  There was a\nshade on it, and it was pulled down.  He reached up underneath it,\nfelt for the window fastening, and unlocked it; then cautiously\ntested the window itself by lifting it an inch or two–it slid\neasily in its grooves.",
        "He stood then for a moment, hardfaced, a frown gathering his\nforehead into heavy furrows, as the flashlight’s ray again and again\ndarted hither and thither.  There was nothing, absolutely nothing in\nthe room but wooden packing cases.  He lifted the cover of the one\nnearest to him and looked inside.  It was quite empty, except for\nsome pieces of heavy cord, and a few cardboard shoe boxes that, in\nturn, were empty, too.",
        "“It’s here, of course,” said Jimmie Dale thoughtfully to himself.\n\"Clever work, too!  But I can’t move half a hundred packing cases\nwithout that chap below hearing me; and I can’t do it in ten\nminutes, either, which, I imagine is the outside limit of time.\nFortunately, though, these cases are not without their compensation–\na dozen men could hide here.”",
        "He began to move about the room.  And now he stooped before one pile\nof boxes and then another, curiously attempting to lift up the\nentire pile from the bottom.  Some he could not move; others, by\nexerting all his strength, gave a little; and then, finally, over in\none corner, he found a pile that appeared to answer his purpose.",
        "“These are certainly empty,” he muttered.",
        "There was just room to squeeze through between them and the next\nstack of cases alongside; but, once through, by the simple expedient\nof moving the cases out a little to take advantage of the angle made\nby the corner of the room, he obtained ample space to stand\ncomfortably upright against the wall.  But Jimmie Dale was not\nsatisfied yet.  Could he see out into the room?  He experimented\nwith his flashlight–and carefully shifted the screen of cases\nbefore him a little to one side.  And yet still he was not\nsatisfied.  With a sort of ironical droop at the corners of his\nlips, as though suddenly there had flashed upon him the inspiration\nthat fathered one of those whimsical ideas and fancies that were so\nessentially a characteristic of Jimmie Dale, he came out from behind\nthe cases, went across the room to the case he had opened when he\nfirst entered, took out the cord and the cover of one of the\ncardboard shoe boxes, and with these returned to his hiding place\nonce more.",
        "The sounds from the upper stories of the tenement now reached him\nhardly at all; but from below, directly under his feet almost, he\ncould hear some one, the proprietor of the shoe store probably,\nwalking about.",
        "Tense, every faculty now on the alert, his head turned in a\nstrained, attentive attitude, Jimmie Dale threw on the flashlight’s\ntiny switch, took that intimate and thin metal case from his pocket,\nextracted a diamond-shaped, gray paper seal with the little\ntweezers, moistened the adhesive side, and stuck it in the centre of\nthe white cardboard-box cover, then tore the edges of the cardboard\ndown until the whole was just small enough to slip into his pocket.\nThrough the cardboard he looped a piece of cord, placard fashion,\nand with his pencil printed the four words–\"with the compliments of\n\"–above the gray seal.  He surveyed the result with a grim,\nmirthless chuckle–and put the piece of cardboard in his pocket.",
        "“I’m taking the longest chances I ever took in my life,” said Jimmie\nDale very seriously to himself, as his fingers twisted, and doubled,\nand tied the remaining pieces of cord together, and finally\nfashioned a running noose in one end.  “I don’t–”  The cord and the\nflashlight went into his pocket, the room was in darkness, the black\nmask was whipped from his breast pocket and adjusted to his face,\nand his automatic was in his hand.",
        "Came the creak of a footstep, as though on a ladder exactly below\nhim, another, and another, receding curiously in its direction, yet\nat the same time growing louder in sound as if nearer the floor–\nthen a crack of light showed in the floor in the centre of the room.\nThis held for an instant, then expanded suddenly into a great\nluminous square–and through a trapdoor, opened wide now, a man’s\nhead appeared.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes, fixed through the space between the piles of\ncases, narrowed–there was, indeed, little doubt but that the shoe-\nstore proprietor below was an accomplice!  The store served a most\nconvenient purpose in every respect–as a secret means of entry into\nthe room, as a sort of guarantee of innocence for the room itself.\nWhy not!  To the superficial observer, to the man who might by some\nchance blunder into the room–it was but an adjunct of the store\nitself!",
        "The man in the trap-doorway paused with his shoulders above the\nfloor, looked around, listened, then drew himself up, walked across\nthe floor, and shot the heavy bolt on the door that led into the\nhallway of the house.  He returned then to the trapdoor, bent over\nit, and whistled softly.  Two more men, in answer to the summons,\ncame up into the room.",
        "“The Cap’ll be along in a minute,” one of them said.  “Turn on the\nlight.”",
        "A switch clicked, flooding the room with sudden brilliancy from half\na dozen electric bulbs.",
        "“Too many!” grunted the same voice again.  “We ain’t working to-\nnight–turn out half of ’em.”",
        "The sudden transition from the darkness for a moment dazzled Jimmie\nDale’s eyes–but the next moment he was searching the faces of the\nthree men.  There were few crooks, few denizens of the crime world\nbelow the now obsolete but still famous dead line that, as Larry the\nBat, he did not know at least by sight.",
        "“Moulton, Whitie Burns, and Marty Dean,” confided Jimmie Dale softly\nto himself.  “And I don’t know of any worse, except–the Cap.  And\ngun fighters, every one of them, too–nice odds, to say nothing of–”",
        "“Here’s the Cap now!” announced one of the three.  “Hello, Cap,\nwhere’d you raise the mustache?”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes shifted to the trapdoor, and into them crept a\ncontemptuous and sardonic smile–the man who was coming up now and\nhoisting himself to the floor was the man who, half an hour before,\nhad threatened young Sammy Matthews with arrest.",
        "The Cap, alias Bert Malone, alias a score of other names, closed the\ntrapdoor after him, pulled off his mustache and gray wig, tucked\nthem in his pocket, and faced his companions brusquely.",
        "“Never mind about the mustache,” he said curtly.  “Get busy, the lot\nof you.  Stir around and get the works out!”",
        "“What for?” inquired Whitie Burns, a sharp, ferret-faced little man.\n\"We got enough of the old stuff on hand now, and that bum break\nGregor made when he pinched the cracked plate put the finish on\nthat.  Say, Cap–”",
        "“Close your face, Whitie, and get the works out!” Malone cut in\nshortly.  “We’ve only got the whole night ahead of us–but we’ll\nneed it all.  We’re going to run the queer off that cracked plate.”",
        "One of the others, Marty Dean this time, a certain brutal\naggressiveness in both features and physique, edged forward.",
        "“Say, what’s the lay?” he demanded.  “A joke?  We printed one fiver\noff that plate–and then we knew enough to quit.  With that crack\nalong the corner, you couldn’t pass ’em on a blind man!  And Gregor\nsaying he thought we could patch the plate up enough to get by with\ngives me a pain–he’s got jingles in his dome factory!  Run them\nfivers eh–say, are you cracked, too?”",
        "“Aw, forget it!” observed Malone caustically.  “Who’s running this\ngang?”  Then, with a malicious grin: “I got a customer for those\nfivers–fifteen thousand dollars for all we can turn out to-night.\nSee?”",
        "The others stared at him for a moment, incredulity and greed\nmingling in a curious half-hesitant, half-expectant look on their\nfaces.",
        "Then Whitie Burns spoke, circling his lips with the tip of his\ntongue:",
        "“D’ye mean it, Cap–honest?  What’s the lay?  How’d you work it?”",
        "Malone, unbending with the sensation he had created, grinned again.",
        "“Easy enough,” he said offhandedly.  It was like falling off a log.\nGregor said, didn’t he, that the only way he had been able to get\nhis claws on that plate was on account of young Matthews going away\nsick–eh?  Well, the old Matthews woman, his mother, has got money–\nabout fifteen thousand.  I guess she ain’t got any more than that,\nor I’d have raised the ante.  Aw, it was easy.  She threw it at me.\nI framed one up on them, that’s all.  I’m Kline, of the secret\nservice–see?  I don’t suppose they’d ever seen him, though they’d\nknow his name fast enough, but I made up something like him.  I\nshowed them where I had a case against Sammy for pinching the plate\nthat was strong enough to put a hundred innocent men behind the\nbars.  Of course, he knew well enough he was innocent, but he could\nsee the twenty years I showed him with both eyes.  Say, he mussed\nall over the place, and went and fainted like a girl.  And then the\nold woman came across with an offer of fifteen thousand for the\nplate, and corrupted me.”  Malone’s cunning, vicious face, now that\nthe softening effects of the gray hair and mustache were gone,\nseemed accentuated diabolically by the grin broadening into a laugh,\nas he guffawed.",
        "Marty Dean’s hand swung with a bang to Malone’s shoulder.",
        "“Say, Cap–say, you’re all right!” he exclaimed excitedly.  You’re\nthe boy!  But what’s the good of running anything off the plate\nbefore turning it over to ’em–the stuff’s no good to us.”",
        "“You got a wooden nut, with sawdust for brains,” said Malone\nsarcastically.  “If he’d thought the gang of counterfeiters that was\nsupposed to have bought the plate from him had run off only one\nfiver and then stopped because they say it wouldn’t get by, and\nweren’t going to run any more, and just destroy the plate like it\nwas supposed to have been destroyed to begin with, and it all end up\nwith no one the wiser, where d’ye think we’d have banked that\nfifteen thousand!  I told him I had the whole run confiscated, and\nthat the queer went with the plate, so we’ll just make that little\nrun to-night–that’s why I sent word around to you this morning.”",
        "“By the jumping!” ejaculated Whitie Burns, heavy with admiration.\n\"You got a head on you, Cap!”",
        "“It’s a good thing for some of you that I have,” returned Malone\ncomplacently.  “But don’t stand jawing all night.  Go on, now–get\nbusy!”",
        "There was no surprise in Jimmie Dale’s face–he had chosen his\nposition behind a pile of cases that he had been extremely careful,\nas a man is careful when his life hangs in the balance, to assure\nhimself were empty.  None of the four came near or touched the pile\nbehind which he stood; but, here and there about the room, they\npulled this one and that one out from various stacks.  In scarcely\nmore than a moment, the room was completely transformed.  It was no\nlonger a storeroom for surplus stock, for the storage of bulky and\nempty packing cases!  From the cases the men had picked out, like a\ntouch of magic, appeared a veritable printing plant, an elaborate\nengraver’s outfit–a highly efficient foot-power press, rapidly\nbeing assembled by Whitie Burns; an electric dryer, inks, a pile of\nwhite, silk-threaded bank-note paper, a cutter, and a score of other\nappurtenances.",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale very gently to himself.  “Yes, quite so–but\nthe plate?  Ah!”  Malone was taking it out from the middle of a\nbundle of old newspapers, loosely tied together, that he had lifted\nfrom one of the cases.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes fastened on it–and from that instant never left\nit.  A minute passed, two, three of them–the four men were silently\nbusy about the room–Malone was carefully cleaning the plate.",
        "“They will raid to-night.  Look out for Kline, he is the sharpest\nman in the United State secret service\"–the warning in her letter\nwas running through Jimmie Dale’s mind.  Kline–the real Kline–was\ngoing to raid the place to-night.  When?  At what time?  It must be\nnearly eleven o’clock already, and–",
        "It came sudden, quick as the crack of doom–a terrific crash against\nthe bolted door–but the door, undoubtedly to the surprise of those\nwithout, held fast, thanks to the bolt.  The four men, white-faced,\nseemed for an instant turned to statues.  Came another crash against\nthe door–and a sharp, imperative order to those within to open it\nand surrender.",
        "“We’re pinched!  Beat it!” whispered Whitie Burns wildly–and dashed\nfor the trapdoor.",
        "Like a rat for its hole, Marty Dean followed.  Malone, farther away,\ndropped the plate on the floor, and rushed, with Moulton beside him,\nafter the others–but he never reached the trapdoor.",
        "Over the crashing blows, raining now in quick succession on the door\nof the room, over a startled commotion as lodgers, roomers, and\ntenants on the floor above awoke into frightened activity with\nshouts and cries, came the louder crash of a pile of packing boxes\nhurled to the floor.  And over them, vaulting those scattered in his\nway, Jimmie Dale sprang at Malone.  The man reeled back, with a\ncry.  Moulton dashed through the trapdoor and disappeared.  The\nshort, ugly barrel of Jimmie Dale’s automatic was between Malone’s\neyes.",
        "“You make a move,” said Jimmie Dale, in a low sibilant way, “and\nI’ll drop you where you stand!  Put your hands behind your back–\npalms together!”",
        "Malone, dazed, cowed, obeyed.  A panel of the door split and rent\ndown its length–the hinges were sagging.  Jimmie Dale worked like\nlightning.  The cord with the slip noose from his pocket went around\nMalone’s wrists, jerked tight, and knotted; the placard, his lips\ngrim, with no sign of humour, Jimmie Dale dangled around the man’s\nneck.",
        "“An introduction for you to Mr. Kline out there–that you seem so\nfond of!” gritted Jimmie Dale.  Then, working as he talked: “I’ve\ngot no time to tell you what I think of you, you pitiful hound\"–he\nsnatched up the plate from the floor and put it in his pocket–\"\nTwenty years, I think you said, didn’t you?\"–his hand shot into\nMalone’s pocket-book, and extracted the five-dollar note–”  If you\ncan open this with your toes maybe you can get a way\"–he wrenched\nthe trapdoor over and slammed it shut–\"good-night, Malone\"–and he\nleaped for the window.",
        "The door tottered inward from the top, ripping, tearing, smashing\nhinges, panels, and jamb.  Jimmie Dale got a blurred vision of brass\nbuttons, blue coats, and helmets, and, in the forefront, of a\nstocky, gray-mustached, gray-haired man in plain clothes.",
        "Jimmie Dale threw up the window, swung out, as with a rush the\nofficers burst through into the room and a revolver bullet hummed\nviciously past his ear, and dropped to the ground–into encircling\narms!",
        "“Ah, no, you don’t, my bucko!” snapped a hoarse voice in his ear.\n\"Keep quiet now, or I’ll crack your bean–understand!”",
        "But the officer, too heavy to be muscular, was no match for Jimmie\nDale, who, even as he had dropped from the sill, had caught sight of\nthe lurking form below; and now, with a quick, sudden, lithe\nmovement he wriggled loose, his fist from a short-arm jab smashed\nupon the point of the other’s jaw, sending the man staggering\nbackward–and Jimmie Dale ran.",
        "A crowd was already collecting at the mouth of the alleyway, mostly\noccupants of the house itself, and into these, scattering them in\nall directions, eluding dexterously another officer who made a grab\nfor him, Jimmie Dale charged at top speed, burst through, and headed\ndown the street, running like a deer.",
        "Yells went up, a revolver spat venomously behind him, came the\nshrill CHEEP-CHEEP! of the police whistle, and heavy boots pounding\nthe pavement in pursuit.",
        "Down the block Jimmie Dale raced.  The yells augmented in his rear.\nAnother shot–and this time he heard the bullet buzz.  And then he\nswerved–into the next alleyway–that flanked the Sanctuary.",
        "He had perhaps a ten yards’ lead, just a little more than the\ndistance from the street to the side door of the Sanctuary that\nopened on the alleyway.  And, as he ran now, his fingers tore at his\nclothing, loosening his tie, unbuttoning coat, vest, collar, shirt,\nand undershirt.  He leaped at the door, swung it open, flung himself\ninside–and then sacrificing speed to silence, went up the stairs\nlike a cat, cramming his mask now into his pocket.",
        "His room was on the first landing.  In an instant he had unlocked\nthe door, entered, and locked it again behind him.  From outside, an\nexcited street urchin’s voice shrilled up to him:",
        "“He went in that door!  I seen him!”",
        "The police whistle chirped again; and then an authoritative voice:",
        "“Get around and watch the saloon back of this, Heeney–there’s a way\nout through there from this joint.”",
        "Jimmie Dale, divested of every stitch of clothing that he had worn,\npulled a disreputable collarless flannel shirt over his head, pulled\non a dirty and patched pair of trousers, and slipped into a\nthreadbare and filthy coat.  Jimmie Dale was working against\nseconds.  They were at the lower door now.  He lifted the oilcloth\nin the corner of the room, lifted up the loose piece of the\nflooring, shoved his discarded garments inside, and from a little\nbox that was there smeared the hollow of his hand with some black\nsubstance, possessed himself of two little articles, replaced the\nflooring, replaced the oilcloth, and, in bare feet, stole across the\nroom to the door.  Against the door, without a sound, Jimmie Dale\nplaced a chair, and on the chair seat he laid the two little\narticles he had been carrying in his hand.  It was intensely black\nin the room, but Jimmie Dale needed no light here.  From under the\nbed he pulled out a pair of woolen socks and a pair of congress\nboots, both as disreputable as the rest of his attire, put them on–\nand very quietly, softly, cautiously, stretched himself out on the\nbed.",
        "The officers were at the top of the stairs.  A voice barked out:",
        "“Stand guard on this landing, Peters.  Higgins, you take the one\nabove.  We’ll start from the top of the house and work down.  Allow\nno one to pass you.”",
        "“Yes, sir!  Very good, Mr. Kline,” was the response.",
        "Kline!–the sharpest man in the United States secret service, she\nhad said.  Jimmie Dale’s lips set.",
        "“I’m glad I had no shave this morning,” said Jimmie Dale grimly to\nhimself.",
        "His fingers were working with the black substance in the hollow of\nhis hand–and the long, slim, tapering fingers, the shapely, well-\ncared-for hands grew unkempt and grimy, black beneath the finger\nnails–and a little, too, played its part on the day’s growth of\nbeard, a little around the throat and at the nape of the neck, a\nlittle across the forehead to meet the locks of straggling and\ndisordered hair.  Jimmie Dale wiped the residue from the hollow of\nhis hand on the knee of his trousers–and lay still.",
        "An officer paced outside.  Upstairs doors opened and closed.  Gruff,\nharsh tones in commands echoed through the house.  The search party\ndescended to the second floor–and again the same sounds were\nrepeated.  And then, thumping down the creaking stairs, they stopped\nbefore Jimmie Dale’s room.  Some one tried the door, and, finding it\nlocked, rattled it violently.",
        "“Open the door!”  It was Kline’s voice,",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes were closed, and he was breathing regularly,\nthough just a little slower than in natural respiration.",
        "“Break it down!” ordered Kline tersely.",
        "There was a rush at it–and it gave.  It surged inward, knocked\nagainst the chair, upset the latter, something tinkled to the floor–\nand four officers, with Kline at their head, jumped into the room.",
        "Jimmie Dale never moved.  A flashlight played around the room and\nfocused upon him–and then he was shaken roughly–only to fall\ninertly back on the bed again.",
        "“I guess this is all right, Mr. Kline,” said one of the officers.\n\"It’s Larry the Bat, and he’s doped to the eyes.  There’s the stuff\non the floor we knocked off the chair.”",
        "“Light the gas!” directed Kline curtly; and, being obeyed, stooped\nto the floor and picked up a hypodermic syringe and a small bottle.\nHe held the bottle to the light, and read the label: LIQUOR\nMORPHINAE.   “Shake him again!” he commanded.",
        "None too gently, a policeman caught Jimmie Dale by the shoulder and\nshook him vigorously–again Jimmie Dale, once the other let go his\nhold, fell back limply on the bed, breathing in that same, slightly\nslowed way.",
        "“Larry the Bat, eh?” grunted Kline; then, to the officer who had\nvolunteered the information: “Who’s Larry the Bat?  What is he?  And\nhow long have you known him?”",
        "“I don’t know who he is any more than what you can see there for\nyourself,” replied the officer.  “He’s a dope fiend, and I guess a\npretty tough case, though we’ve never had him up for anything.  He’s\nlived here ever since I’ve been on the beat, and that’s three years\nor–”",
        "“All right!” interrupted Kline crisply.  “He’s no good to us!  You\nsay there’s an exit from this house into that saloon at the back?”",
        "“Yes, sir but the fellow, whoever he is, couldn’t get away from\nthere.  Heeney’s been over on guard from the start.”",
        "“Then he’s still inside there,” said Kline, clipping off his words.\n\"We’ll search the saloon.  Nice night’s work this is!  One out of\nthe whole gang–and that one with the compliments of the Gray Seal!”",
        "The men went out and began to descend the stairs.",
        "“One,” said Jimmie Dale to himself, still motionless, still\nbreathing in that slow way so characteristic of the drug.  “Two.\nThree.  Four.”",
        "The minutes went by–a quarter of an hour–a half hour.  Still\nJimmie Dale lay there–still motionless–still breathing with slow\nregularity.  His muscles began to cramp, to give him exquisite\ntorture.  Around him all was silence–only distant sounds from the\nstreet reached him, muffled, and at intervals.  Another quarter of\nan hour passed–an eternity of torment.  It seemed to Jimmie Dale,\nfor all his will power, that he could not hold himself in check,\nthat he must move, scream out even in the torture that was passing\nall endurance.  It was silent now, utterly silent–and then out of\nthe silence, just outside his door, a footstep creaked–and a man\nwalked to the stairs and went down.",
        "“Five,” said Jimmie Dale to himself.  “The sharpest man in the\nUnited States secret service.”",
        "And then for the first time Jimmie Dale moved–to wipe away the\nbeads of sweat that had sprung out upon his forehead.",
        "Larry the Bat shambled out of the side door of the tenement into the\nback alleyway; shambled along the black alleyway to the street–and\nsmiled a little grimly as a shadow across the roadway suddenly\nshifted its position.  The game was growing acute, critical,\ndesperate even–and it was his move.",
        "Larry the Bat, disreputable denizen of the underworld, alias Jimmie\nDale, millionairs clubman, alias the Gray Seal, whom Carruthers of\nthe MORNING NEWS-ARGUS called the master criminal of the age,\nshuffled along in the direction of the Bowery, his hands plunged\ndeep in the pockets of his frayed and tattered trousers, where his\nfingers, in a curious, wistful way, fondled the keys of his own\nmagnificent residence on Riverside Drive.  It was his move–and it\nwas an impasse, ironical, sardonic, and it was worse–it was full of\nperil.",
        "True, he had outwitted Kline of the secret service two nights\nbefore, when Kline had raided the counterfeiters’ den; true, he had\nno reason to believe that Kline suspected HIM specifically, but the\nman Kline wanted HAD entered the tenement that night, and since then\nthe house had been shadowed day and night.  The result was both\nsimple and disastrous–to Jimmie Dale.  Larry the Bat, a known\ninmate of the house, might come and go as he pleased–but to emerge\nfrom the Sanctuary in the person of Jimmie Dale would be fatal.\nKline had been outwitted, but Kline had not acknowledged final\ndefeat.  The tenement had been searched from top to bottom–\nunostentatiously.  His own room on the first landing had been\nsearched the previous afternoon, when he was out, but they had\nfailed to find the cunningly contrived opening in the floor under\nthe oilcloth in the corner, an impromptu wardrobe, that would\nproclaim Larry the Bat and Jimmie Dale to be one and the same\nperson–that would inevitably lead further to the establishment of\nhis identity as the Gray Seal.  In time, of course, the surveillance\nwould cease–but he could not wait.  That was the monumental irony\nof it–the factor that, all unknown to Kline, was forcing the issue\nhard now.  It was his move.",
        "Since, years ago now, as the Gray Seal, he had begun to work with\nHER, that unknown, mysterious accomplice of his, and the police,\nstung to madness both by the virulent and constant attacks of the\npress and by the humiliating prod of their own failures, sought\ndaily, high and low, with every resource at their command, for the\nGray Seal, he had never been in quite so strange and perilous a\nplight as he found himself at that moment.  To preserve inviolate\nthe identity of Larry the Bat was absolutely vital to his safety.\nIt was the one secret that even she, who so strangely appeared to\nknow all else about him, he was sure, had not discovered–and it was\njust that, in a way, that had brought the present impossible\nsituation to pass.",
        "In the month previous, in a lull between those letters of hers, he\nhad set himself doggedly and determinedly to the renewed task of\nwhat had become so dominantly now a part of his very existence–the\nsolving of HER identity.  And for that month, as the best means to\nthe end–means, however, that only resulted as futilely as the\nattempts that had gone before–he had lived mostly as Larry the Bat,\nreturning to his home in his proper person only when occasion and\nnecessity demanded it.  He had been going home that evening, two\nnights before, walking along Riverside Drive, when from the window\nof the limousine she had dropped the letter at his feet that had\nplunged him into the affair of the Counterfeit Five–and he had not\ngone home!  Eventually, to save himself, he had, in the Sanctuary,\nperforming the transformation in desperate haste, again been forced\nto assume the role of Larry the Bat.",
        "That was really the gist of it.  And yesterday morning he had\nremembered, to his dismay, that he had had little or no money left\nthe night before.  He had intended, of course, to replenish his\nsupply–when he got home.  Only he hadn’t gone home!  And now he\nneeded money–needed it badly, desperately.  With thousands in the\nbank, with abundance even in his safe, in his own den at home, a\nsupply kept there always for an emergency, he was facing actual\nwant–he rattled two dimes, a nickel, and a few odd pennies\nthoughtfully against the keys in his pocket.",
        "To a certain extent, old Jason, his butler, could be trusted.  Jason\neven knew that mysterious letters of tremendous secretive importance\ncame to the house, and the old man always meant well–but he dared\nnot trust even Jason with the secret of his dual personality.  What\nwas he to do?  He needed money imperatively–at once.  Thanks to\nKline, for the time being, at least, he could not rid himself of the\npersonality of Larry the Bat by the simple expedient or slipping\ninto the clothes of Jimmie Dale–he must live, act, and remain Larry\nthe Bat until the secret service officer gave up the hunt.  How\nbridge the gulf between Jimmie Dale and Larry the Bat in old Jason’s\neyes!",
        "Nor was that all.  There was still another matter, and one that, in\norder to counteract it, demanded at once a serious inroad–to the\nextent of a telephone call–upon his slender capital.  A too\nprolonged and unaccounted-for absence from home, and old Jason, in\nhis anxious, blundering solicitude, would have the fat in the fire\nat that end–and the city, and the social firmament thereof, would\nbe humming with the startling news of the disappearance of a well-\nknown millionaire.  The complications that would then ensue, with\nhimself powerless to lift a finger, Jimmie Dale did not care to\nthink about–such a contretemps must at all hazards be prevented.",
        "Jimmie Dale reached the corner of the street, where it intersected\nthe Bowery, and paused languidly by the curb.  No one appeared to be\nfollowing.  He had not expected that there would be–but it was as\nwell to be sure.  He walked then a few steps along the Bowery–and\nslipped suddenly into a doorway, from where he could command a view\nof the street corner that he had just left.  At the end of ten\nminutes, satisfied that no one had any concern in his immediate\nmovements, he shambled on again down the Bowery.",
        "There was a saloon two blocks away that boasted a private telephone\nbooth.  Jimmie Dale made that his destination.",
        "Larry the Bat was a very well-known character in that resort, and\nthe bullet-headed dispenser of drinks behind the bar nodded\nunctuously to him over the heads of those clustered at the rail as\nhe entered; Larry the Bat, as befitted one of the elite of the\nunderworld, was graciously pleased to acknowledge the proletariat\nsalutation with a curt nod.  He walked down to the end of the room,\nentered the telephone booth–and was carelessly careful to close the\ndoor tightly behind him.",
        "He gave the number of his residence on Riverside Drive, and waited\nfor the connection.  After some delay, Jason’s voice answered him.",
        "“Jason,” said Jimmie Dale, in matter-of-fact tones, “I shall be out\nof the city for another three or four days, possibly a week, and–\"\nhe stopped abruptly, as a sort of gasp came to him over the wire.",
        "“Thank God that’s you, sir!” exclaimed the old butler wildly.  “I’ve\nbeen near mad, sir, all day!”",
        "“Don’t get excited, Jason!” said Jimmie Dale a little sharply.  “The\nmere matter of my absence for the last two days is nothing to cause\nyou any concern.  And while I am on the subject, Jason, let me say\nnow that I shall be glad if you will bear that fact in mind in\nfuture.”",
        "“Yes, sir,” stammered Jason.  “But, sir, it ain’t that–good Lord,\nMaster Jim, it ain’t that, sir!  It’s–it’s one of them letters.”",
        "Something like a galvanic shock seemed to jerk the disreputable,\nloose-jointed frame of Larry the Bat suddenly erect–and a strained\nwhiteness crept over the dirty, unwashed face.",
        "“Go on, Jason,” said Jimmie Dale, without a quiver in his voice.",
        "“It came this morning, sir–that shuffer with his automobile left\nit.  I had just time to say you weren’t at home, sir, and he was\ngone.  And then, sir, there ain’t been an hour gone by all through\nthe day that a woman, sir–a lady, begging your pardon, Master Jim–\nhasn’t rung up on the telephone, asking if you were back, and if I\ncould get you, and where you were, and half frantic, sir, half\nsobbing, sometimes, sir, and saying there was a life hanging on it,\nMaster Jim.”",
        "Larry the Bat, staring into the mouthpiece of the instrument,\nsubconsciously passed his hand across his forehead, and\nsubconsciously noted that his fingers, as he drew them away, were\ndamp.",
        "“Where is the letter now, Jason?” inquired Jimmie Dale coolly.",
        "“Here on your desk, Master Jim.  Shall I bring it to you?”",
        "Bring it to him!  How?  When?  Where?  Bring it to him!  The ghastly\nirony of it!  Jimmie Dale tried to think–prodding, spurring\ndesperately that keen, lightning brain of his that had never failed\nhim yet.  How bridge the gulf between Larry the Bat and Jimmie Dale\nin Jason’s eyes–not just for the replenishing of funds now, but\nwith a life at stake!",
        "“No–I think not, Jason,” said Jimmie Dale calmly.  Just leave it\nwhere it is.  And if she telephones again, say that you have told\nme–that will be sufficient to satisfy any further inquiries.  And\nJason–”",
        "“Yes, sir?”",
        "“If she telephones again, try and find out where the call comes\nfrom.”",
        "“I haven’t forgotten what you said once, Master Jim, sir,” said the\nold man eagerly.  “And I’ve been trying that sir, all day.  They’ve\nall come from different pay stations, sir.”",
        "A mirthless little smile tinged Jimmie Dale’s lips.  Of course!  He\nmight have known!  It was always that way, always the same.  He was\nas near to the solution of her identity at that moment as he had\nbeen years ago, when she, in some mysterious way, alone of all the\nworld, had identified him as the Gray Seal!",
        "“Very good, Jason,” he said quietly.  “Don’t bother about it any\nmore.  It will be all right.  You can expect me when you see me.\nGood-night.”  He hung the receiver on the hook, walked out of the\nbooth, and mechanically reached the street.",
        "All right!  It was far from “all right\"–very far from it.  It was\nno trivial thing, that letter; they never had been trivial things,\nthose letters of hers, that involved so often a matter of life and\ndeath–as this one now, perhaps, as her actions would seem to\nindicate, involved life and death more urgently than any that had\ngone before.  It was far from all right–at a moment when his own\nposition, his own safety, was at best but a desperate chance; when\nhis every energy, brain, wit, and cunning were taxed to the utmost\nto save himself!  And yet, somehow, some way, at any cost, he must\nget that letter–and at any cost he must act upon it!  To fail her\nwas to fail utterly in everything that failure in its most\nmiserable, its widest sense, implied–failure in that which rose\nparamount to every other consideration in life!",
        "Fail her!  Jimmie Dale’s lips thinned into a hard, drawn line–and\nthen parted slowly in a curiously whimsical smile.  It would be a\nstrange burglary that he had decided upon, in order that he might\nnot fail her–stranger than any the Gray Seal had ever committed,\nand, in some respects, even more perilous!",
        "He started along the Bowery, walking briskly now, toward the nearest\nsubway station, at Astor Place, his mind for the moment electing to\nface the situation in a humour as whimsical as his smile.  Supposing\nthat, as Larry the Bat, he were caught and arrested during the next\nhour, in Jimmie’s Dale’s residence on Riverside Drive!  With his\narrest as Larry the Bat, Jimmie’s Dale would automatically\ndisappear.  Would follow then the suspicion that Jimmie Dale, the\nmillionaire, had met with foul play, and as time went on, and Jimmie\nDale, being then in prison as Larry the Bat, did not reappear, the\nassurance of it; then the certainty that suspicion would focus on\nLarry the Bat as being connected with the millionaire’s death, since\nLarry the Bat had been caught in Jimmie Dale’s home–and he would be\naccused of his own murder!  It was quite humourous, of course, quite\ngrotesquely bizarre–but it was equally an exceedingly grim\npossibility!  There were drawbacks to a dual personality!",
        "“In a word,” confided Jimmie Dale softly to himself, and a serious\nlight crept into the dark, steady eyes, “I’m in a bit of a nasty\nmess!”",
        "At Astor Place he entered the subway; at Fourteenth Street he\nchanged to an express, and at Ninety-sixth Street he got out.  It\nwas but a short walk west to Riverside Drive, and from there his\nhouse was only a few blocks farther on.",
        "Jimmie Dale did not slouch now.  And for all his disreputable\nattire, incongruous as it was in that neighbourhood, few people that\nhe passed paid any attention to him, none gave him more than a\ncasual glance–Jimmie Dale swung along, upright, with no attempt to\nmake himself inconspicuous, hurrying a little, as one intent upon a\ndefinite errand.  As he neared his house he slowed his pace a little\nuntil a couple, who were passing in front of it, had gone on; then\nhe went up the steps, but noiselessly as a shadow now, to the front\ndoor, opened it softly, closed it softly behind him, and crouched\nfor a moment in the vestibule.",
        "Through the monogrammed lace on the plate glass of the inner doors\nhe could see, a little indistinctly, into the reception hall beyond.\nThe hall was empty.  Jason, for that matter, would be the only one\nlikely to be about; the other servants would have no business there\nin any case, and whether in their quarters above or below, they had\ntheir own stairs at the rear.",
        "Jimmie Dale inserted the key in the spring lock, and opened the door\na cautious fraction of an inch–to listen.  There was no sound–yes,\na subdued murmured–the servants were downstairs in the basement.\nHe slipped inside, slipped, in a flash, across the hall, and,\ntreading like a cat, went up the stairs.  He scarcely seemed to\nbreathe until, with a little sigh of relief, he stood inside his den\non the first floor, with the door shut behind him.",
        "“I must speak to Jason about being a little more watchful,” muttered\nJimmie Dale facetiously.  “Here’s all my property at the mercy of–\nLarry the Bat!”",
        "An instant he stood by the door, looking about him–in the bright\nmoonlight streaming in through the side windows the room’s\nappointments stood out in soft shadows, the huge davenport, the\ngreat, luxurious easy-chairs, an easel with a half-finished canvas,\nas he had left it; the big, flat-topped, rosewood desk, the open\nfireplace–and then, his steps silent on the thick velvet rug under\nfoot, he walked quickly to the desk.",
        "Yes, there it was–the letter.  He placed it hurriedly in his\npocket–the moonlight was not strong enough to read by, and he dared\nnot turn on the lights.",
        "And now money–funds.  In the alcove behind the portiere, Jimmie\nDale dropped on his knees before the squat, barrel-shaped safe, and\nopened it.  He reached inside, took out a package of banknotes,\nplaced the bills in his pocket–and hesitated a moment.  What else\nwould he require?  What act did that letter call upon the Gray Seal\nto perform in the next few hours?  Jimmie Dale stared thoughtfully\ninto the interior of the safe.  Whatever it was, it must be\nperformed in the role of Larry the Bat, for though he could get into\nhis dressing room now, and become Jimmie Dale again, there were\nstill those watchers outside the Sanctuary–THEY must not become\nsuspicious–and if Larry the Bat disappeared mysteriously, Larry the\nBat would be the man that Kline and the secret service of the United\nStates would never cease hunting for, and that would mean that he\ncould never reassume a character that was as necessary for his\nprotection as breath was to life, so long as the Gray Seal worked.\nTrue, he could change now to Jimmie Dale, but he would have to\nchange back again and return to the Sanctuary before morning, as\nLarry the Bat–and remain there until Kline, beaten, called off his\nhuman bloodhounds.  No, a change was not to be thought of.",
        "What, then, would he require–that compact little kit of burglar\ntools, rolled in its leather jacket, that, unrolled slipped about\nhis body like a close-fitting undervest?  As well to take it anyway.\nHe removed his coat and vest, took out the leather bundle from the\nsafe, untied the thongs that bound it together, unrolled it, passed\nit around his body, life belt fashion, secured the thongs over his\nshoulders, and put on his coat and vest again.  A revolver, a\nflashlight?  He had both–at the Sanctuary, under the flooring–but\nthere were duplicates here!  He slipped them into his pockets.\nAnything else–to forestall and provide for any possible\ncontingency?  He hesitated again for a moment, thinking, then slowly\nclosed the inner door of the safe, locked it, swung the outer door\nshut–and, in the act of twirling the knobs, sprang suddenly to his\nfeet.  Sharp, shrill in the stillness of the room, the telephone\nbell on the desk rang out clamourously.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face set hard, as he leaped out from behind the\ncurtain–had Jason heard it!  It rang again before he could reach\nthe desk–was ringing as he snatched the receiver from the hook.",
        "“Yes, yes!” he called, in a low, guarded, hasty way, into the\nmouthpiece.  “Hello!  What is it?”  And then one hand, resting on\nthe desk, closed around the edge, and tightened until the skin over\nthe knuckles grew ivory white.  It was–SHE!  She!  It was HER\nvoice–he had only heard it once in all his life–that night, two\nnights before, in a silvery laugh from the limousine as it had sped\naway from him down the road–but he knew!  It thrilled him now with\na mad rhapsody, robbing him for the moment of every thought save\nthat she was living, real, existent–that it was HER voice.  “It’s\nyou–YOU!” he said hoarsely.",
        "“Oh, Jimmie–you at last!\"–it came in a little gasping cry of\nrelief.  “The letter–”",
        "“Yes, I’ve got it–it’s all right–it’s all right\"–the words would\nnot seem to come fast enough in his desperate haste.  “But it’s you\nnow.  Listen!  Listen!” he pleaded.  “Tell me who you are!  My God!\nhow I’ve tried to find you, and–”",
        "That rippling, silvery laugh again, but now, too, it seemed to his\neager ear, with just the faintest note of wistfulness in it.",
        "“Some day, Jimmie.  That letter now.  It–”",
        "Jimmie Dale straightened up suddenly–Jason’s steps, running,\nsounded outside the room along the corridor–there was not an\ninstant to lose.",
        "“Hang up!  Good-bye!  Danger!  Don’t ring again!” he whispered\nhurriedly, and, with a miserable smile, replacing the receiver\nbitterly on the hook, he jumped for the curtain.",
        "He reached it none too soon.  The door opened, an electric-light\nswitch clicked, and the room was flooded with light.  Jason, still\nrunning, headed for the desk.",
        "“It’ll be her again!” Jimmie Dale heard the old man mutter, as from\nthe edge of the portiere he watched the other’s actions.",
        "Jason picked up the telephone.",
        "“Hello!  Hello!” he called–then began to click impatiently with the\nreceiver hook.  “Hello! . . .    Who? . . .  Central? . . .  I don’t\nwant any number–somebody was calling here. . . . What? . . .\nNobody on the wire!”",
        "He set the telephone back on the desk with a bewildered air.",
        "“That’s queer!” he exclaimed.  “I could have sworn I heard it ring\ntwice, and–”  He stopped abruptly, and, leaning across the desk,\nhung there, wide-eyed, staring, while a sickly pallor began to steal\ninto his face.  “The letter!” he mumbled wildly.  “The letter–\nMaster Jim’s letter–the letter–it’s GONE!”",
        "Trembling, excited, the old man began to search the desk, then down\non his knees on the floor under it; and then, growing more frantic\nwith every instant, rose and began to hunt around the room in an\nagitated, aimless fashion.",
        "Jason’s distress was very real–he was almost beside himself now\nwith fear and anxiety.  A whimsical, affectionate smile played over\nJimmie Dale’s lips at the old man’s antics–and changed suddenly\ninto one of consternation.  Jason was making directly now for the\ncurtain behind which he stood!  Perhaps, though, he would pass it\nby, and–Jason’s hand reached out and grasped the portiere.",
        "“Jason!” said Jimmie Dale sharply.",
        "The old man staggered back as though he had been struck, tried to\nspeak, choked, and gazed at the curtain with distended eyes.",
        "“Is–is that you, sir–Master Jim–behind the curtain there?” he\nfinally blurted out.  “I–sir–you gave me a start–and the letter,\nMaster Jim–”",
        "“Don’t lose your head, Jason,” said Jimmie Dale coolly.  “I’ve got\nthe letter.  Now do as I bid you.”",
        "“Yes–Master Jim,” faltered the old man.",
        "“Pull down the window shades and draw the portiere together,\"\ndirected Jimmie Dale.",
        "Jason, still overwrought and excited, obeyed a little awkwardly.",
        "“Now the lights, Jason,” instructed Jimmie Dale.  “Turn them off,\nand go and sit down in that chair at the desk.”",
        "Again Jason obeyed, stumbling in the darkness as he returned from\nthe electric-light switch at the farther end of the room.  He sat\ndown in the chair.",
        "Larry the Bat stepped out from behind the curtain.  “I came for that\nletter, Jason,” he explained quietly.  “I am going out again now.  I\nmay be back to-morrow; I may not be back for a week.  You will say\nnothing, not a word, of my having been here to-night.  Do you\nunderstand, Jason?”",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Jason; then hesitantly: “Would you mind saying,\nsir, when you came in?”",
        "“It’s of no consequence, Jason–is it?”",
        "“No, sir,” said Jason.",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled in the darkness.",
        "“Jason!”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“I wish you to remain where you are, without leaving that chair, for\nthe next ten minutes.”  He moved across the room to the door.\n\"Good-night, Jason,” he said.",
        "“Good-night, Master Jim–good-night, sir–oh, Lord!”",
        "Jimmie Dale did not require that ten minutes; it was a very wide\nmargin of safety to obviate the possibility of Jason, from a window,\ndetecting the exit of a disreputable character from the house–in\nthree minutes he was turning the corner of the first cross street\nand walking rapidly away from Riverside Drive.",
        "In the subway station Jimmie Dale read the letter–read it twice\nover, as he always read those strange epistles of hers that opened\nthe door to new peril, new danger to the Gray Seal, but too, that\nseemed somehow to draw tighter, in a glad, big way, the unseen bond\nbetween them; read it, as he always read those letters, almost\nsubconsciously committing the very words to memory with that keen\nfaculty of brain of his.  But now as he began to tear the sheet and\nenvelope into minute particles, a strained, hard look was on his\nface and in his eyes, and his lips, half parted, moved a little.",
        "“It’s a death warrant,” muttered Jimmie Dale.  “I–I guess to-night\nwill see the end of the Gray Seal.  She says I needn’t do it, but I\nguess it’s worth the risk–a human life!”",
        "A downtown express roared into the station.",
        "“What time is it?” Jimmie Dale asked the guard, as he stepped\naboard.",
        "“’Bout midnight,” the man answered tersely.",
        "The forward car was almost empty, and Jimmie Dale chose a seat by\nhimself.  How did she know?  How did she know not only this, but the\nhundred other affairs that she had outlined in those letters of\nhers?  By what means, superhuman, indeed, it seemed, did she–Jimmie\nDale jerked himself erect suddenly.  What good did it do to\nspeculate on that now, when every minute was priceless?  What was HE\nto do, how was he to act, what plan could he formulate and carry\nout, and WIN against odds that, at the outset, were desperate enough\neven to forecast almost certain failure–and death!",
        "Who would ever have suspected old Tom Ludgate, known for years\nthroughout the squalour of the East Side as old Luddy, the pushcart\nman, of having a bag of unset diamonds under his pillow–or under\nthe sack, rather, that he probably used for a pillow!  What a queer\nthing to do!  But then, old Luddy was a character–apparently always\nin the most poverty-stricken condition, apparently hardly more than\nkeeping body and soul together, trusting no one, and obsessed by the\ndread that by depositing in a bank some one would discover that he\nhad money, and attempt to force it from him, he had put his savings,\nyear after year, for twenty years, twenty-five years, perhaps, into\nunset stone–diamonds.  How had she found that out?",
        "Jimmie Dale sank into a deeper reverie.  He could steal them all\nright, and they would be well worth the stealing–old Luddy had done\nwell, and lived and existed on next to nothing–the stones, she\nsaid, were worth about fifteen thousand dollars.  Not so bad, even\nfor twenty-five years of vegetable selling from a pushcart!  He\ncould steal them all right; it would tax the Gray Seal’s ingenuity\nlittle to do so simple a thing as that, but that was not all, nor,\nindeed, hardly a factor in it–it was vital that if he were to\nsucceed at all he must steal them PUBLICLY, as it were.",
        "And after that–WHAT?  His own chances were pretty slim at best.\nJimmie Dale, staring at the grayness of the subway wall through the\nwindow, shook his head slowly–then, with a queer little\nphilosophical shrug of his shoulders, he smiled gravely, seriously.\nIt was all a part of the game, all a part of the life–of the Gray\nSeal!",
        "It was half-past twelve, or a little later, as nearly as he could\njudge, for Larry the Bat carried no such ornate thing in evidence as\na watch, as he halted at the corner of a dark, squalid street in the\nlower East Side.  It was a miserable locality–in daylight humming\nwith a cosmopolitan hive of pitiful humans dragging out as best they\ncould an intolerable existence, a locality peopled with every\nnationality on earth, their community of interest the struggle to\nmaintain life at the lowest possible expenditure, where necessity\neven was pared and shaved down to a minimum; but now, at night time,\nor rather in the early-morning hours, the darkness, in very mercy,\nit seemed, covered it with a veil, as it were, and in the quiet that\nhung over it now hid the bald, the hideous, aye, and the piteous,\ntoo, from view.",
        "It was a narrow street, and the row of tenement houses, each house\nalmost identical with its neighbour, that flanked the pavement on\neither side, seemed, from where Jimmie Dale stood looking down its\nlength, from the corner, to converge together at a point a little\nway beyond, giving it an unreal, ominous, cavernlike effect.  And,\ntoo, there seemed something ominous even in its quiet.  It was as\nthough one sensed acutely the crouching of some Thing in its lair–\nwaiting silently, viciously, with sullen patience.",
        "A footstep sounded–another.  Jimmie Dale drew quickly back around\nthe corner into an areaway.  Two men passed–in helmets–swinging\ntheir nightsticks–that beat was always policed in pairs!",
        "They passed on, turned the corner, and went down the narrow cross\nstreet that Jimmie Dale had just been inspecting.  He started to\nfollow–and drew back again abruptly.  A form flitted suddenly\nacross the road and disappeared in the darkness in the officers’\nwake–ten yards behind the first another followed–at the same\ninterval of distance still another–and yet still one more–four in\nall.",
        "The darkness hid all six, the two policemen, the four men behind\nthem–the only sounds were the OFFICERS’ footsteps dying away in the\ndistance.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s fingers were mechanically testing the mechanism of the\nautomatic in his pocket.",
        "“The Skeeter’s gang!” he muttered to himself.  “Red Mose, the\nMidget, Harve Thoms–and the Skeeter!  The Worst apaches in the city\nof New York; death contractors–the lowest bidders!  Professional\nassassins, and a man’s life any time for twenty-five dollars!  I\nwonder–I’ve never done it yet–but I wonder if it would be a crime\nin God’s sight if one shot–to KILL!”",
        "Jimmie Dale was at the corner again–again the street before him was\nblack, deserted, empty.  He chose the right hand side, and, well in\nthe shadow of the houses, as an extra precaution, stole along\nsilently.  He stopped finally before one where, in the doorway, hung\na little sign.  Jimmie Dale mounted the porch, and with his eyes\nclose to the sign could just make out the larger words in the big\nprinted type:",
        "Jimmie Dale nodded.  That was right.  The first house on the right-\nhand side, with the room-to-rent sign, her letter had said.  His\nfingers were testing the doorknob.  The door was not locked.",
        "“Naturally, it wouldn’t be locked,” Jimmie Dale told himself grimly–\nand stepped inside.",
        "He stood for an instant without movement, every faculty on the\nalert.  Far up above him a step, guarded though his trained ear made\nit out to be, creaked faintly upon the stairs–there was no other\nsound.  The creaking, almost inaudible at its loudest, receded\nfarther up–and silence fell.",
        "In the darkness, noiselessly, Jimmie Dale groped for the stairway,\nfound it, and began to ascend.  The minutes passed–it seemed a\nminute even from step to step, and there were three flights to the\ntop!  There must be no creaking this time–the slightest sound, he\nknew well enough, would be not only fatal to the work he had to do,\nbut probably fatal to himself as well.  He had been near death many\ntimes–the consciousness that he was nearer to it now, possibly,\nthan he had ever been before, seemed to stimulate his senses into\nacute and abnormal energy.  And, too, the physical effort, as, step\nby step, the flexed muscles relaxing so slowly, little by little,\ngradually, each time as he found foothold on the step higher up, was\na terrific strain.  At the top his face was bathed in perspiration,\nand he wiped it off with his coat sleeve.",
        "It was still dark here, intensely dark, and his eyes, though grown\naccustomed to it, could make out nothing but the deeper shadow of\nthe walls.  But thanks to her, always a mistress of accurate and\nminute detail, he possessed a mental plan of his surroundings.  The\nhead of the stairs gave on the middle of the hallway–the hallway\nran to his right and left.  To his right, on the opposite side of\nthe hall, was the door of old Luddy’s squalid two-room apartment.",
        "For a moment Jimmie Dale stood hesitant–a sudden perplexity and\nanxiety growing upon him.  It was strange!  What did it mean?  He\nhad nerved himself to a quick, desperate attempt, trusting to\nsurprise and his own wit and agility for victory–there had seemed\nno other way than that, since he had seen those four men at the\ncorner–since they were AHEAD of him.  True, they were not much\nahead of him, not enough to have accomplished their purpose–and,\nfurthermore, they were not in that room.  He knew that absolutely,\nbeyond question of doubt.  He had listened for just that all the\nnerve-racking way up the stairs.  But where were they?  There was no\nsound–not a sound–just blackness, dark, impenetrable, utter, that\nbegan to palpitate now.",
        "It came in a whisper, wavering, sibilant–from his left.  A sort of\nrelief, fierce in the breaking of the tense expectancy, premonitory\nin the possibilities that it held, swept Jimmie Dale.  He crept\nalong the hall.  The whisper had come from that room, presumably\nempty–that was for rent!",
        "By the door he crouched–his sensitive fingers, eyes to Jimmie Dale\nso often–feeling over jamb and panels with a delicate, soundless\ntouch.  The door was just ajar.  The fingers crept inside and\ntouched the knob and lock–there was no key within.",
        "The whispering still went on–but it seemed like a screaming of\nvultures now in Jimmie Dale’s ears, as the words came to him.",
        "“Aw, say, Skeeter, dis high-brow stunt gives me de pip!  Me fer\ngoin’ in dere an’ croakin’ de geezer reg’lar, widout de frills.\nWho’s to know?  Say, just about two minutes, an’ we’re beatin’ it\nwid de sparklers.”",
        "An inch, a half inch at a time, the knob slowly, very, very slowly\nturning, the door was being closed by the crouched form on the\nthreshold.",
        "“Close yer trap, Mose!” came a fierce response.  “We ain’t fixed the\nlay all day for nothin’.  There ain’t a soul on earth knows he’s got\nany sparklers, ’cept us.  If there was, it would be different–then\nthey’d know that was what whoever did it was after, see?”",
        "The door was closed–the knob slowly, very, very slowly being\nreleased again.  From one of the leather pockets under Jimmie Dale’s\nvest came a tiny steel instrument that he inserted in the key-hole.",
        "The same voice spoke on:",
        "“That’s what we’re croaking him for, ’cause nobody knows about them\ndiamonds, and so’s he can’t TELL anybody afterward that any were\npinched.  An’ that’s why it’s got to look like he just got tired of\nliving and did it himself.  I guess that’ll hold the police when\nthey find the poor old duck hanging from the ceiling, with a bit of\ncord around his neck, and a chair kicked out from under his feet on\nthe floor.  Ain’t you got the brains of a louse to see that?”",
        "“Sure\"–the whisper came dully, in grudging intonation through the\npanels–the door was locked.  “Sure, but it’s de hangin’ ’round\nwaitin’ to get busy that’s gettin’ me goat, an’–”",
        "Jimmie Dale straightened up and began to retreat along the corridor.\nA merciless rage was upon him now, every fiber of his being seemed\nto tingle and quiver with it–the damnable, hellish ingenuity of it\nall seemed to choke and suffocate him.",
        "“Luck!” muttered Jimmie Dale between his clenched teeth.  “Oh, the\nblessed luck to get that door locked!  I’ve got time now to set the\nstage for my own get-away before the showdown!”",
        "He stole on along the corridor.  Excerpts from her letter were\nrunning through his brain: “It would do no good to warn him, Jimmie–\nthe Skeeter and his gang would never let up on him until they got\nthe stones. . . .  It would do no good for you to steal them first,\nfor they would only take that as a ruse of old Luddy’s, and murder\nthe man first and hunt afterward. . . .  In some way you must let\nthe Skeeter SEE you steal them, make them think, make them certain\nthat it is a bona-fide theft, so that they will no longer have any\ninterest or any desire to do old Luddy harm. . . .  And for it to\nappear real to them, it must appear real to old Luddy himself–do\nnot take any chances there.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes narrowed.  Yes, it was simple enough now with\nthat pack of hell’s wolves guarded for the moment by a locked door,\nforced to give him warning by breaking the door before they could\nget out.  It was simple enough now to enter old Luddy’s room, steal\nthe stones at the revolver point, then make enough disturbance–when\nhe was ready–to set the gang in motion, and, as they rushed in open\nhim, to make his escape with the stones to the roof through Luddy’s\nroom.  That was simple enough–there was an opening to the roof in\nLuddy’s room, she had said, and there was a ladder kept there in\nplace.  On hot nights, it seemed, the old man used to go up there\nand sleep on the roof–not now, of course.  It was too late in the\nyear for that–but the opening in the roof was there, and the ladder\nremained there, too.",
        "Yes, it was simple enough now.  And the next morning the papers\nwould rave with execrations against the Gray Seal–for the robbery\nof the life savings of a poor, defenseless old man, for committing\nas vile and pitiful a crime as had ever stirred New York!  Even\nCarruthers, of the MORNING NEWS-ARGUS, would be moved to bitter\nattack.  Good old Carruthers–who little thought that the Gray Seal\nwas his old college pal, his present most intimate friend, Jimmie\nDale!  And afterward–after the next morning?  Well, that, at least,\nhad never been in doubt.  Old Luddy could be made to leave New York,\nand, once away, with the Skeeter and his gang robbed of incentive to\npay any further attention to him, the stones could be secretly\nreturned to the old man.  And it would to the public, to the police,\nbe just another of the Gray Seal’s crimes–that was all!",
        "Jimmie Dale had reached old Luddy’s door.  The Gray Seal?  Oh, yes,\nthey would know it was the Gray Seal–the insignia was familiar\nenough; familiar to the crooks of the underworld, who held it in\nawe; familiar to the police, to whom it was an added barb of\nridicule.  He was placing it now, that insignia, a diamond-shaped,\ngray paper seal, on the panel of the door; and now, a black silk\nmask adjusted over his face, Jimmie Dale bent to insert the little\nsteel instrument in the lock–a pitiful, paltry thing, a cheap lock,\nto fingers that could play so intimately with twirling knobs and\ndials, masters of the intricate mechanism of vaults and safes!",
        "And then, about to open the door, a sort of sudden dismay fell upon\nhim.  He had not thought of that–somehow, it had not occurred to\nhim!  WHAT WAS IT THEY WERE WAITING FOR?  Why had they not struck at\nonce, as, when he had first entered the house, he had supposed they\nwould do?  What was it?  Why was it?  Was old Luddy out?  Were they\nwaiting for his return–or what?",
        "The door, without sound, moved gradually under his hand.  A faint\nodor assailed his nostrils!  It was dark, very dark.  Across the\nroom, in a direct line, was the doorway of the inner room–she had\nexplained that in her letter.  It was slow progress to cross that\nroom without sound, in silence–it was a snail’s movement–for fear\nthat even a muscle might crack.",
        "And now he stood in the inner doorway.  It was dark here, to–and\nyet, how bizarre, a star seemed to twinkle through the very roof of\nthe room itself!  The odour was pungent now.  There was a long-drawn\nsigh–then a low, indescribable sound of movement.  SOMEBODY, APART\nFROM OLD LUDDY, WAS IN THE ROOM!",
        "It swept, the full consciousness of it, upon Jimmie Dale in an\ninstantaneous flash.  Chloroform; the open scuttle in the roof; the\nwaiting of those others–all fused into a compact logical whole.\nThey had loosened the scuttle during the day, probably when old\nLuddy was away–one of them had crept down there now to chloroform\nthe old man into insensibility–the others would complete the\nghastly work presently by stringing their victim up to the ceiling–\nand it would be suicide, for, long before morning came, long before\nthe old man would be discovered, the fumes of the chloroform would\nbe gone.",
        "It seemed like a cold hand, deathlike, clutching at his heart.  Was\nhe too late, after all!  Chloroform alone could–kill!  To the\nright, just a little to the right–he must make no mistake–his ear\nplaced the sound!  He whipped his hands from the side pockets of his\ncoat–the ray of his flashlight cut across the room and fell upon an\naged face upon a bed, upon a hand clutching a wad of cloth, the\ncloth pressed horribly against the nose and mouth of the upturned\nface–and then, roaring in the stillness, spitting a vicious lane of\nfire that paralleled the flashlight’s ray, came the tongue flame of\nhis automatic.",
        "There was a yell, a scream, that echoed out, reverberated, and went\nracketing through the house, and Jimmie Dale leaped forward–over a\ntable, sending it crashing to the floor.  The man had reeled back\nagainst the wall, clutching at a shattered wrist, staring into the\nflashlight’s eye, white-faced, jaw dropped, lips working in mingled\npain and fear.",
        "“Harve Thoms–you, eh?” gritted Jimmie Dale.",
        "A cunning look swept the distorted face.  Here, apparently, was only\none man–there were pals, three of them, only a few yards away.",
        "“You ain’t got nothing on me!” he snarled, sparring for time.  “You\npolice are too damned fresh with your guns!”",
        "“I’ll take yours!” snapped Jimmie Dale, and snatched it deftly from\nthe other’s pocket.  “This ain’t any police job, my bucko, and you\nmake a move and I’ll drop you for keeps, if what you’ve got already\nain’t enough to teach you to keep your hands off jobs that belong to\nyour betters!”",
        "He was working with mad haste as he spoke.  One minute at the\noutside was, perhaps, all he could count upon.  Already he had\ncaught the rattle of the locked door down the hall.  He lit a match\nand turned on the gas over the bed–it was the most dangerous thing\nhe could do–he knew that well enough, none knew it better–it was\noffering himself as a fair mark when the others rushed in, as they\nwould in a moment now–but the Skeeter and his gang and this man\nhere must have no misconception of his purpose, his reason for being\nthere, the same as their own, the theft of the stones–and no\nmisconception as to his SUCCESS.",
        "“Y’ain’t the police!\"–it came in a choked gasp from the other, as\nhe blinked in the sudden light “Say then–”",
        "“Shut up!” ordered Jimmie Dale curtly.  “And mind what I told you\nabout moving!”  He leaned over the bed.  Old Luddy, though under the\ninfluence of the chloroform, was moving restlessly.  Thoms had\nevidently only begun to apply the chloroform–old Luddy was safe!\nJimmie Dale ran his hand in under the pillow.  “If you ain’t swiped\nthem already they ought to be here!” he growled; “and if you have\nI’ll–ah!”  A little chamois bag was in his hand.  He laughed\nsneeringly at Thoms, opened the bag, allowed a few stones to trickle\ninto his hand–and then, without stopping to replace them, dashed\nstones and bag into his pocket.  The door along the corridor crashed\nopen.",
        "“What’s that?” he gasped out, in well-simulated fright–and sprang\nfor the ladder that led up to the roof.",
        "It had all taken, perhaps, the minute that he had counted on–no\nmore.  Noises came from the floors below now, a confusion of them–\nthe shot, the scream had been heard by others, save those who had\nbeen in the locked room.  And the latter were outside now in the\ncorridor, running to their accomplice’s aid.",
        "There was a pause at the outer door–then an oath–and coupled with\nthe oath an exclamation:",
        "“The Gray Seal!”",
        "They had swept a flashlight over the door panel–Jimmie Dale,\nhalfway up the ladder, smiled grimly.",
        "The door opened–there was a rush of feet.  The man with the\nshattered wrist yelled, cursing wildly:",
        "“Here he is–on the ladder!  Let him have it!  Fill him full of\nholes!”",
        "Jimmie Dale was in the light–they were in the dark of the outer\nroom.  He fired at the threshold, checking their rush–as a hail of\nbullets chipped and tore at the ladder and spat wickedly against the\nwall.  He swung through to the roof, trying, as he did so, to kick\nthe ladder loose behind him.  It was fastened!",
        "The three gunmen jumped into the room–from the roof Jimmie Dale got\na glimpse of them below, as he flung himself clear of the opening.\nBullets whistled through the aperture–a voice roared up as he\ngained his feet:",
        "“Come on!  After him!  The whole place is alive, but this lets us\nout.  We can frame up how we came to be here easy enough.  Never\nmind the old geezer there any more!  Get the Gray Seal–the reward\nthat’s out for him is worth twice the sparklers, and–”",
        "Jimmie Dale hurled the cover over the scuttle.  He could have stood\nthem off from above and kept the ladder clear with his revolver, but\nthe alarm seemed general now–windows were opening, voices were\ncalling to one another–from the windows across the street he must\nstand out in sharp outline against the sky.  Yes–he was seen now.",
        "A woman’s voice, from a top-story window across the street, screamed\nout, high-pitched in excitement:",
        "“There he is!  There he is!  On the roof there!”",
        "Jimmie Dale started on the run along the roof.  The houses, built\nwall to wall, flat-roofed, seemed to offer an open course ahead of\nhim–until a lane or an intersecting street should bar his way!  But\nthey were not quite all on the same level, though–the wall of the\nnext house rose suddenly breast high in front of him.  He flung\nhimself up, regained his feet–and ducked instantly behind a\nchimney.",
        "The crack of a revolver echoed through the night–a bullet drummed\nthrough the air–the Skeeter and his gang were on the roof now,\ndashing forward, firing as they ran.  Two shots from Jimmie Dale’s\nautomatic, in quick succession cooled the ardour of their rush–and\nthey broke, black, flitting forms, for the shelter of chimneys, too.",
        "And now the whole neighbourhood seemed awakened.  A dull-toned roar,\nas from some great gulf below, rolled up from the street, a medley\nof slamming windows, the rush of feet as people poured from the\nhouses, cries, shouts, and yells–and high over all the shrill call\nof the police-patrol whistle–and the CRACK, CRACK, CRACK of the\nSkeeter’s revolver shots–the Skeeter and his hellhounds for once\nself-appointed allies of the law!",
        "Twice again Jimmie Dale fired–then crouching, running low, he\nzigzagged his way across the next roof.  The bullets followed him–\nonce more his pursuers dashed forward.  And again Jimmie Dale, his\nface set like stone now, his breath coming in hard gasps, dodged\nbehind a chimney, and with his gun checked their rush for the third\ntime.",
        "He glanced about him–and with a growing sense of disaster saw that\ntwo houses farther on the stretch of roof appeared to end.  There\nwould be a lane or a street there!  And in another minute or two, if\nit were not already the case, others would be following the gunmen\nto the roof, and then he would be–he caught his breath suddenly in\na queer little strangled cry of relief.  Just back of him, a few\nyards away, his eyes made out what, in the darkness, seemed to be a\nglass skylight.",
        "A dark form sped like a deeper shadow across the black in front of\nhim, making for a chimney nearer by, closing in the range.  Jimmie\nDale fired–wide.  Tight as was the corner he was in, little as was\nthe mercy deserved at his hands, he could not, after all, bring\nhimself to shoot–to kill.",
        "A voice, the Skeeter’s, bawled out raucously:",
        "“Rush him all together–from different sides at once!”",
        "A backward leap!  Jimmie Dale’s boot was crashing glass and frame,\nstamping at it desperately, making a hole for his body through the\nskylight.  A yell, a chorus of them, answered this–then the crunch\nof racing feet on the gravel roof.  He emptied his revolver,\nsweeping the darkness with a semicircle of vicious flashes.",
        "It seemed an hour–it was barely the fraction of a second, as he\nhung by his hands from the side of the skylight frame, his body\nswinging back and forth in the unknown blackness below.  The\nskylight might be, probably was, directly over the stair well, and\nopen clear to the basement of the house–but it was his only chance.\nHe swung his body well out, let go–and dropped.  With the impetus\nhe smashed against a wall, was flung back from it in a sort of\nrebound, and his hands closed, gripping fiercely, on banisters.  It\nhad been the stair well beyond any question of doubt, but his swing\nhad sent him clear of it.",
        "Above, they had not yet reached the skylight.  Jimmie Dale snatched\na precious moment to listen, as he rose, and found himself, apart\nfrom bruises, perhaps unhurt.  There was commotion, too, in this\nhouse below, the alarm had extended and spread along the block–but\nthe commotion was all in the FRONT of the house–the street was the\nlure.",
        "Jimmie Dale started down the stairs, and in an instant he had gained\nthe landing.  In another he had slipped to the rear of the hall–\nsomewhere there, from the hall itself, from one of the rear rooms,\nthere must be an exit to the fire escape.  To attempt to leave by\nthe front way was certain capture.",
        "They were yelling, shouting down now through the sky-light above, as\nJimmie Dale softly raised the window sash at the rear of the hall.\nThe fire escape was there.  Shouts from along the corridor, from the\ntenement dwellers who had been crowding their neighbours’ rooms,\ncraning their necks probably from the front windows, answered the\nshouts now from the roof and the skylight; doors opened; forms\nrushed out–but it was dark in the corridor, only a murky yellow at\nthe upper end from the opened doors.",
        "Jimmie Dale slipped through the window to the fire escape, and,\nworking cautiously, silently, but with the speed of a trained\nathlete, made his way down.  At the bottom he dropped from the iron\nplatform into the back yard, ran for the fence and climbed over into\na lane on the other side.",
        "And then, as he ran, Jimmie Dale snatched the mask from his face and\nput it in his pocket.  He was safe now.  He swept the sweat drops\nfrom his forehead with the back of his hand–noticing them for the\nfirst time.  It had been close–almost as close for him as it had\nbeen for old Luddy.  And to-morrow the papers would execrate the\nGray Seal!  He smiled a little wanly.  His breath was still coming\nhard.  Presently they would scour the lane–when they found that\ntheir quarry was not in the house.  What a racket they were making!\nThe whole district seemed roused like a swarm of angry bees.",
        "He kept on along the lane–and dodged suddenly into a cross street\nwhere the two intersected.  The clang of a bell dinned discordantly\nin his ears–a patrol wagon swept by him, racing for the scene of\nthe disturbance–the riot call was out!",
        "Again Jimmie Dale smiled wearily, passing his hand across his eyes.",
        "“I guess,” said Jimmie Dale, “I’m pretty near all in.  And I guess\nit’s time that Larry the Bat went–home.”",
        "And a little later a figure turned from the Bowery and shambled down\nthe cross street, a disreputable figure, with hands plunged deep in\nhis pockets–and a shadow across the roadway suddenly shifted its\nposition as the shambling figure slouched into the black alleyway\nand entered the tenement’s side door.",
        "And Larry the Bat smiled softly to himself–Kline’s men were still\non guard!",
        "A white-gloved arm, a voice, and a silvery laugh!  “Just that–no\nmore!  Jimmie Dale, in his favourite seat, an aisle seat some seven\nor eight rows back from the orchestra, stared at the stage, to all\noutward appearances absorbed in the last act of the play; inwardly,\nquite oblivious to the fact that even a play was going on.",
        "A white-gloved arm, a voice, and a silvery laugh!  The words had\nformed themselves into a sort of singsong refrain that, for the last\nfew days, had been running through his head.  A strange enough\nguiding star to mould and dictate every action in his life!  And\nthat was all he had ever seen of her, all that he had ever heard of\nher–except those letters, of course, each of which had outlined the\ndetails of some affair for the Gray Seal to execute.",
        "Indeed, it seemed a great length of time now since he had heard from\nher even in that way, though it was not so many days ago, after all.\nPerhaps it was the calm, as it were, that, by contrast, had given\nplace to the strenuous months and weeks just past.  The storm raised\nby the newspapers at the theft of Old Luddy’s diamonds had subsided\ninto sporadic diatribes aimed at the police; Kline, of the secret\nservice, had finally admitted defeat, and a shadow no longer skulked\nday and night at the entrance to the Sanctuary–and Larry the Bat\nbore the government indorsement, so to speak, of being no more\nsuspicious a character than that of a disreputable, but harmless,\ndope fiend of the underworld.",
        "Larry the Bat!  The Gray Seal!  Jimmie Dale the millionaire!  What\nif it were ever known that that strange three were one!  What if–\nJimmie Dale smiled whimsically.  A burst of applause echoed through\nthe house, the orchestra was playing, the lights were on, seats\nbanged, there was the bustle of the rising audience, the play was at\nan end–and for the life of him he could not have remembered a\nsingle line of the last act!",
        "The aisle at his elbow was already crowded with people on their way\nout.  Jimmie Dale stooped down mechanically to reach for his hat\nbeneath his seat–and the next instant he was standing up, staring\nwildly into the faces around him.",
        "It had fallen at his feet–a white envelope.  Hers!  It was in his\nhand now, those slim, tapering, wonderfully sensitive fingers of\nJimmie Dale, that were an “open sesame” to locks and safes,\nsubconsciously telegraphing to his mind the fact that the texture of\nthe paper–was hers.  Hers!  And she must be one of those around\nhim–one of those crowding either the row of seats in front or\nbehind, or one of those just passing in the aisle.  It had fallen at\nhis feet as he had stooped over for his hat–but from just exactly\nwhat direction he could not tell.  His eyes, eagerly, hungrily,\ncritically, swept face after face.  Which one was hers?  What irony!\nShe, whom he would have given his life to know, for whom indeed he\nrisked his life every hour of the twenty-four, was close to him now,\nwithin reach–and as far removed as though a thousand miles\nseparated them.  She was there–but he could not recognise a face\nthat he had never seen!",
        "With an effort, he choked back the bitter, impotent laugh that rose\nto his lips.  They were talking, laughing around him.  Her VOICE–\nyes, he had once heard that, and that he would recognise again.  He\nstrained to catch, to individualise the tone sounds that floated in\na medley about him.  It was useless–of course–every effort that he\nhad ever made to find her had been useless.  She was too clever, far\ntoo clever for that–she, too, would know that he could and would\nrecognise her voice where he could recognise nothing else.",
        "And then, suddenly, he realised that he was attracting attention.\nLevel stares from the women returned his gaze, and they edged away a\nlittle from his vicinity as they passed, their escorts crowding\nsomewhat belligerently into their places.  Others, in the same row\nof seats as his own, were impatiently waiting to get by him.  With a\nmuttered apology, Jimmie Dale raised the seat of his chair, allowing\nthese latter to pass him–and then, slipping the letter into his\npocketbook, he snatched up his hat from the seat rack.",
        "There was still a chance.  Knowing he was there, she would be on her\nguard; but in the lobby, among the crowd and unaware of his\npresence, there was the possibility that, if he could reach the\nentrance ahead of her, she, too, might be talking and laughing as\nshe left the theatre.  Just a single word, just a tone–that was all\nhe asked.",
        "The row of seats at whose end he stood was empty now, and, instead\nof stepping into the thronged aisle, he made his way across to the\nopposite side of the theatre.  Here, the far aisle was less crowded,\nand in a minute he had gained the foyer, confident that he was now\nin advance of her.  The next moment he was lost in a jam of people\nin the lobby.",
        "He moved slowly now, very slowly–allowing those behind to press by\nhim on the way to the entrance.  A babel of voices rose about him,\nas, tight-packed, the mass of people jostled, elbowed, and pushed\ngood-naturedly.  It was a voice now, her voice, that he was\nlistening for; but, though it seemed that every faculty was strained\nand intent upon that one effort, his eyes, too, had in no degree\nrelaxed their vigilance–and once, half grimly, half sardonically,\nhe smiled to himself.  There would be an unexpected aftermath to\nthis exodus of expensively gowned and bejewelled women with their\nprosperous, well-groomed escorts!  There was the Wowzer over there–\nsleek, dapper, squirming in and out of the throng with the agility\nand stealth of a cat.  As Larry the Bat he had met the Wowzer many\ntimes, as indeed he had met and was acquainted with most of the\nelite of the underworld.  The Wowzer, beyond a shadow of doubt, in\nhis own profession stood upon a plane entirely by himself–among\nthose qualified to speak, no one yet had ever questioned the\nWowzer’s claim to the distinction of being the most dexterous and\nfinished “poke getter” in the United States!",
        "The crowd thinned in the lobby, thinned down to the last few belated\nstragglers, who passed him as he still loitered in the entrance; and\nthen Jimmie Dale, with a shrug of his shoulders that was a great\ndeal more philosophical than the maddening sense of chagrin and\ndisappointment that burned within him, stepped out to the pavement\nand headed down Broadway.  After all, he had known it in his heart\nof hearts all the time–it had always been the same–it was only one\nmore occasion added to the innumerable ones that had gone before in\nwhich she had eluded him!",
        "And now–there was the letter!  Automatically he quickened his steps\na little.  It was useless, futile, profitless, for the moment, at\nleast, to disturb himself over his failure–there was the letter!\nHis lips parted in a strange, half-serious, half-speculative smile.\nThe letter–that was paramount now.  What new venture did the night\nhold in store for him?  What sudden emergency was the Gray Seal\ncalled upon to face this time–what role, unrehearsed, without\nwarning, must he play?  What story of grim, desperate rascality\nwould the papers credit him with when daylight came?  Or would they\ncarry in screaming headlines the announcement that the Gray Seal was\ncaged and caught at last, and in three-inch type tell the world that\nthe Gray Seal was–Jimmie Dale!",
        "A block down, he turned from Broadway out of the theatre crowds that\nstreamed in both directions past him.  The letter!  Almost\nfeverishly now he was seeking an opportunity to open and read it\nunobserved; an eagerness upon him that mingled exhilaration at the\nlure of danger with a sense of premonition that, irritably,\ninevitably was with him at moments such as these.  It seemed, it\nalways seemed, that, with an unopened letter of hers in his\npossession, it was as though he were about to open a page in the\nBook of Fate and read, as it were, a pronouncement upon himself that\nmight mean life or death.",
        "He hurried on.  People still passed by him–too many.  And then a\ncafe, just ahead, making a corner, gave him the opportunity that he\nsought.  Away from the entrance, on the side street, the brilliant\nlights from the windows shone out on a comparatively deserted\npavement.  There was ample light to read by, even as far away from\nthe window as the curb, and Jimmie Dale, with an approving nod,\nturned the corner and walked along a few steps until opposite the\nfarthest window–but, as he halted here at the edge of the street,\nhe glanced quickly behind him at a man whom he had just passed.  The\nother had paused at the corner and was staring down the street.\nJimmie Dale instantly and nonchalantly produced his cigarette case,\nselected a cigarette, and fastidiously tapped its end on his thumb\nnail.",
        "“Inspector Burton in plain clothes,” he observed musingly to\nhimself.  “I wonder if it’s just a fluke–or something else?  We’ll\nsee.”",
        "Jimmie Dale took a box of matches from his pocket.  The first would\nnot light.  The second broke, and, with an exclamation of annoyance,\nhe flung it away.  The third was making a fitful effort at life, as\nanother man emerged hastily from the cafe’s side door, hurried to\nthe corner, joined the man who was still loitering there, and both\ntogether disappeared at a rapid pace down the street.",
        "Jimmie Dale whistled softly to himself.  The second man was even\nbetter known than the first; there was not a crook in New York but\nwould side-step Lannigan of headquarters, and do it with amazing\ncelerity–if he could!",
        "“Something up!  But it’s not my hunt!” muttered Jimmie Dale; then,\nwith a shrug of his shoulders: “Queer the way those headquarters\nchaps fascinate and give me a thrill every time I see them, even if\nI haven’t a ghost of a reason for imagining that–”",
        "The sentence was never finished.  Jimmie Dale’s face was gray.  The\nstreet seemed to rock about him–and he stared, like a man stricken,\nwhite to the lips, ahead of him.  THE LETTER WAS GONE!  His hand,\nwriggling from his empty pocket, swept away the sweat beads that\nwere bursting from his forehead.  It had come at last–the pitcher\nhad gone once too often to the well!",
        "Numbed for an instant, his brain cleared now, working with lightning\nspeed, leaping from premise to conclusion.  The crush in the theatre\nlobby–the pushing, the jostling, the close contact–the Wowzer, the\nslickest, cleverest pickpocket in the United States!  For a moment\nhe could have laughed aloud in a sort of ghastly, defiant mockery–\nhe himself had predicted an unexpected aftermath, had he not!",
        "Aftermath!  It was–the END!  An hour, two hours, and New York would\nbe metamorphosed into a seething caldron of humanity bubbling with\nthe news.  It seemed that he could hear the screams of the newsboys\nnow shouting their extras; it seemed that he could see the people,\nroused to frenzy, swarming in excited crowds, snatching at the\npapers; he seemed to hear the mob’s shouts swell in execration, in\nexultation–it seemed as though all around him had gone mad.  The\nmystery of the Gray Seal was solved!  It was Jimmie Dale, Jimmie\nDale, Jimmie, Dale, the millionaire, the lion of society–and there\nwas ignominy for an honoured name, and shame and disaster and\nconvict stripes and sullen penitentiary walls–or death!  A felon’s\ndeath–the chair!",
        "He was running now, his hands clenched at his sides; his mind,\nworking subconsciously, urging him onward in a blind, as yet\nunrealised, objectless way.  And then gradually impulse gave way to\ncalmer reason, and he slowed his pace to a quick, less noticeable\nwalk.  The Wowzer!  That was it!  There was yet a chance–the\nWowzer!  A merciless rage, cold, deadly, settled upon him.  It was\nthe Wowzer who had stolen his pocketbook, and with it the letter.\nThere could be no doubt of that.  Well, there would be a reckoning\nat least before the end!",
        "He was in a downtown subway train now–the roar in his ears in\nconsonance, it seemed, with the turmoil in his brain.  But now, too,\nhe was Jimmie Dale again; and, apart from the slightly outthrust\njaw, the tight-closed lips, impassive, debonair, composed.",
        "There was yet a chance.  As Larry the Bat he knew every den and lair\nbelow the dead line, and he knew, too, the Wowzer’s favourite\nhaunts.  There was yet a chance, only one in a thousand, it was\ntrue, almost too pitiful to be depended upon–but yet a chance.  The\nWowzer had probably not worked alone, and he and his pal, or pals,\nwould certainly not remain uptown either to examine or divide their\nspoils–they would wait until they were safe somewhere in one of\ntheir hell holes on the East Side.  If he could find the Wowzer,\nreach the man BEFORE THE LETTER WAS OPENED–Jimmie Dale’s lips grew\ntighter.  THAT was the chance!  It he failed in that–Jimmie Dale’s\nlips drooped downward in grim curves at the corners.  A chance!\nAlready the Wowzer had at least a half hour’s lead, and, worse\nstill, there was no telling which one of a dozen places the man\nmight have chosen to retreat to with his loot.",
        "Time passed.  His mind obsessed, Jimmie Dale’s physical acts were\nalmost wholly mechanical.  It was perhaps fifteen minutes since he\nhad discovered the loss of the letter, and he was walking now\nthrough the heart of the Bowery.  Exactly how he had got there he\ncould not have told; he had only a vague realisation that, following\nan intuitive sense of direction, he had lost not a second of time in\nmaking his way downtown.",
        "And now he found himself hesitating at the corner of a cross street.\nTwo blocks east was that dark, narrow alleyway, that side door that\nmade the entrance to the Sanctuary.  It would be safer, a hundred\ntimes safer, to go there, change his clothes and his personality,\nand emerge again as Larry the Bat–infinitely safer in that role to\nexplore the dens of the underworld, many of them indeed unknown and\nundreamed of by the police themselves, than to trust himself there\nin well-cut, fashionable tweeds–but that would take time.  Time!\nWhen, with every second, the one chance he had, desperate as that\nalready was, was slipping away from him.  No; what was apparently\nthe greater risk at least held out the only hope.",
        "He went on again–his brain incessantly at work.  At the worst,\nthere was one mitigating factor in it all.  He had no need to think\nof her.  Whatever the ruin and disaster that faced him in the next\nfew hours, she in any case was safe.  There was no clew to HER\nidentity in the letter; and where he, for months on end, with even\nmore to work upon, had failed at every turn to trace her, there was\nlittle fear that any one else would have any better success.  She\nwas safe.  As for himself–that was different.  The Gray Seal would\nbe referred to in the letter, there would be the outline, the data\nfor the “crime” she had planned for that night; and the letter,\nthough unaddressed, being found in his pocketbook, where cards and\nnotes and a dozen different things among its contents proclaimed him\nJimmie Dale, needed no further evidence as to its ownership nor the\nidentity of the Gray Seal.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s fingers crept inside his vest and fumbled there for a\nmoment–and a diamond stud, extracted from his shirt front,\nglistened sportively in the necktie that was now tucked jauntily in\nat one side of his shirt bosom.  He had reached the Blue Dragon, one\nof Wowzer’s usual hang outs, and, swerving from the sidewalk,\nentered the place.  There was wild tumult within–a constant storm\nof applause, derision, and hilarity that was hurled from the tables\naround the room at the turkey-trotting, tango-writhing couples on\nthe somewhat restricted space of polished hardwood flooring in the\ncentre.  Jimmie Dale swaggered down the room, a cigar tilted up at\nan angle between his teeth, his soft felt hat a little rakishly on\none side of his head and well over his nose.",
        "At the end of the room, at the bar, Jimmie Dale leaned toward the\nbarkeeper and talked out of the corner of his mouth.  There were\nprivate rooms upstairs, and he jerked his head surreptitiously\nceilingward.",
        "“Say, is de Wowzer up dere?” he inquired in a cautious whisper.",
        "The man behind the bar, well known to Jimmie Dale as one of the\nWowzer’s particular pals, favoured him with a blank stare.",
        "“Never heard of de guy!” he announced brusquely.  “Wot’s yours?”",
        "“Gimme a mug of suds,” said Jimmie Dale, reaching for a match.  He\npuffed at his cigar, blew out the match, and, after a moment, flung\nthe charred end away–but on his hand, as, palm outward, he raised\nit to take his glass, the match had traced a small black cross.",
        "The barkeeper put down the beer he had just drawn, wiped his hand\nhurriedly, and with sudden enthusiasm thrust it across the bar.",
        "“Glad to know youse, cull!” he exclaimed.  “Wot’s de lay?”",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled.",
        "“Nix!” said Jimmie Dale.  “I just blew in from Chicago.  Used to\nknow de Wowzer dere.  He said dis place was on de level, an’ I could\nalways find him here, dat’s all.”",
        "“Sure, youse can!” returned the barkeeper heartily.  “Only he ain’t\nhere now.  He beat it about fifteen minutes ago, him an’ Dago Jim.\nI guess youse’ll find him at Chang’s, I heard him an’ Dago say dey\nwas goin’ dere.  Know de place?”",
        "Jimmie Dale shook his head.",
        "“I ain’t much wise to New York,” he explained.",
        "“Aw, dat’s easy,” whispered the barkeeper.  “Go down to Chatham\nSquare, an’ den any guy’ll show youse Chang Foo’s.”  He winked\nconfidentially.  “I guess youse won’t bump yer head none gettin’\naround inside.”",
        "Jimmie Dale nodded, grinned back, emptied his glass, and dug for a\ncoin.",
        "“Forget it!” observed the barkeeper cordially.  “Dis is on me.  Any\nfriend of de Wowzer’s gets de glad hand here any time.”",
        "“T’anks!” said Jimmie Dale gratefully, as he turned away.  “So long,\nthen–see youse later.”",
        "Chang Foo’s!  Jimmie Dale’s face set even a little harder than it\nhad before, as he swung on again down the Bowery.  Yes; he knew\nChang Foo’s–too well.  Underground Chinatown–where a man’s life\nwas worth the price of an opium pill–or less!  Mechanically his\nhand slipped into his pocket and closed over the automatic that\nnestled there.  Once in–where he had to go–and the chances were\neven, just even, that was all, that he would ever get out.  Again he\nwas tempted to return to the Sanctuary and make the attempt as Larry\nthe Bat.  Larry the Bat was well enough known to enter Chang Foo’s\nunquestioned, and–but again he shook his head and went on.  There\nwas not time.  The Wowzer and his pal–it was Dago Jim it seemed–\nhad evidently been drinking and loitering their way downtown from\nthe theatre, and he had gained that much on them; but by now they\nwould be smugly tucked away somewhere in that maze of dens below the\nground, and at that moment probably were gloating over the biggest\nnight’s haul they had ever made in their lives!",
        "And if they were!  What then?  Once they knew the contents of that\nletter–what then?  Buy them off for a larger amount than the many\nthousands offered for the capture of the Gray Seal?  Jimmie Dale\ngritted his teeth.  That meant blackmail from them all his life, an\nintolerable existence, impossible, a hell on earth–the slave, at\nthe beck and call of two of the worst criminals in New York!  The\nmoisture oozed again to Jimmie Dale’s forehead.  God, if he could\nget that letter before it was opened–before they KNEW!  If he could\nonly get the chance to fight for it–against ANY odds!  Life!  Life\nwas a pitiful consideration against the alternative that faced him\nnow!",
        "From the Blue Dragon to Chang Foo’s was not far; and Jimmie Dale\ncovered the distance in well under five minutes.  Chang Foo’s was\njust a tea merchant’s shop, innocuous and innocent enough in its\nappearance, blandly so indeed, and that was all–outwardly; but\nJimmie Dale, as he reached his destination, experienced the first\nsensation of uplift he had known that night, and this from what,\napparently, did not in the least seem like a contributing cause.",
        "“Luck!  The blessed luck of it!” he muttered grimly, as he surveyed\nthe sight-seeing car drawn up at the curb, and watched the\npassengers crowding out of it to the ground.  “It wouldn’t have been\nas easy to fool old Chang as it was that fellow back at the Dragon–\nand, besides, if I can work it, there’s a better chance this way of\ngetting out alive.”",
        "The guide was marshalling his “gapers\"–some two dozen in all, men\nand women.  Jimmie Dale unostentatiously fell in at the rear; and,\nthe guide leading, the little crowd passed into the tea merchant’s\nshop.  Chang Foo, a wizened, wrinkled-faced little Celestial, oily,\nsuave, greeted them with profuse bows, chattering the while volubly\nin Chinese.",
        "The guide made the introduction with an all-embracing sweep of his\nhand.",
        "“Chang Foo–ladies and gentlemen,” he announced; then held up his\nhand for silence.  “Ladies and gentlemen,” he said impressively,\n\"this is one of the most notorious, if not THE most notorious dive\nin Chinatown, and it is only through special arrangement with the\nauthorities and at great expense that the company is able\nexclusively to gain an entree here for its patrons.  You will see\nhere the real life of the Chinese, and in half an hour you will get\nwhat few would get in a lifetime spent in China itself.  You will\nsee the Chinese children dance and perform; the Chinese women at\ntheir household tasks; the joss, the shrine of his hallowed\nancestors, at which Chang Foo here worships; and you will enter the\nmost famous opium den in the United States.  Now, if you will all\nkeep close together, we will make a start.”",
        "In spite of his desperate situation, Jimmie Dale smiled a little\nwhimsically.  Yes; they would see it all–UPSTAIRS!  The same old\nbunk dished out night after night at so much a head–and the nervous\nlittle schoolma’am of uncertain age, who fidgeted now beside him,\nwould go back somewhere down in Maine and shiver while she related\nher “wider experiences” in tremulous whispers into the shocked ears\nof envious other maiden ladies of equally uncertain age.  The same\nold bunk–and a profitable one for Chang Foo for more reasons than\none.  It was dust in the eyes of the police.  The police smiled\nknowingly at mention of Chang Foo.  Who should know, if they didn’t,\nthat it was all harmless fake, all bunk!  And so it was–UPSTAIRS!",
        "They were passing out of the shop now, bowed out through a side door\nby the obsequious and oily Chang Foo.  And now they massed again in\na sort of little hallway–and Chang Foo, closing the door upon\nJimmie Dale, who was the last in the line, shuffled back behind the\ncounter in his shop to resume his guard duty over customers of quite\nanother ilk.  With the door closed, it was dark, pitch dark.  And\nthis, too, like everything else connected with Chang Foo’s\nestablishment, for more reasons than one–for effect–and for\nsecurity.  Nervous little twitters began to emanate from the women–\nthe guide’s voice rose reassuringly:",
        "“Keep close together, ladies and gentlemen.  We are going upstairs\nnow to–”",
        "Jimmie Dale hugged back against the wall, sidled along it, and like\na shadow slipped down to the end of the hall.  The scuffling of two\ndozen pairs of feet mounting the creaky staircase drowned the slight\nsound as he cautiously opened a door; the darkness lay black,\nimpenetrable, along the hall.  And then, as cautiously as he had\nopened it, he closed the door behind him, and stood for an instant\nlistening at the head of a ladder-like stairway, his automatic in\nhis hand now.  It was familiar ground to Larry the Bat.  The steps\nled down to a cellar; and diagonally across from the foot of the\nsteps was an opening, ingeniously hidden by a heterogeneous\ncollection of odds and ends, boxes, cases, and rubbish from the\npseudo tea shop above; a low opening in the wall to a passage that\nled on through the cellars of perhaps half a dozen adjoining houses,\neach of which latter was leased, in one name or another–by Chang\nFoo.",
        "Jimmie Dale crept down the steps, and in another moment had gained\nthe farther side of the cellar; then, skirting around the ruck of\ncases, he stooped suddenly and passed in through the opening in the\nwall.  And now he halted once more.  He was straining his eyes down\na long, narrow passage, whose blackness was accentuated rather than\nrelieved by curious wavering, gossamer threads of yellow light that\nshowed here and there from under makeshift thresholds, from doors\nslightly ajar.  Faint noises came to him, a muffled, intermittent\nclink of coin, a low, continuous, droning hum of voices; the sickly\nsweet smell of opium pricked at his nostrils.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face set rigidly.  It was the resort, not only of the\nmost depraved Chinese element, but of the worst “white” thugs that\nmade New York their headquarters–here, in the succession of\ncellars, roughly partitioned off to make a dozen rooms on either\nside of the passage, dope fiends sucked at the drug, and Chinese\ngamblers spent the greater part of their lives; here, murder was\nhatched and played too often to its hellish end; here, the scum of\nthe underworld sought refuge from the police to the profit of Chang\nFoo; and here, somewhere, in one of these rooms, was–the Wowzer.",
        "The Wowzer!  Jimmie Dale stole forward silently, without a sound,\nswiftly–pausing only to listen for a second’s space at the doors as\nhe passed.  From this one came that clink of coin; from another that\njabber of Chinese; from still another that overpowering stench of\nopium–and once, iron-nerved as he was, a cold thrill passed over\nhim.  Let this lair of hell’s wolves, so intent now on their own\naffairs, be once roused, as they certainly must be roused before he\ncould hope to finish the Wowzer, and his chances of escape were–",
        "He straightened suddenly, alert, tense, strained.  Voices, raised in\na furious quarrel, came from a door just beyond him on the other\nside of the passage, where a film of light streamed out through a\ncracked panel–it was the Wowzer and Dago Jim!  And drunk, both of\nthem–and both in a blind fury!",
        "It happened quick then, almost instantaneously it seemed to Jimmie\nDale.  He was crouched now close against the door, his eye to the\ncrack in the panel.  There was only one figure in sight–Dago Jim–\nstanding beside a table on which burned a lamp, the table top\nlittered with watches, purses, and small chatelaine bags.  The man\nwas lurching unsteadily on his feet, a vicious sneer of triumph on\nhis face, waving tauntingly an open letter and Jimmie Dale’s pocket-\nbook in his hands–waving them presumably in the face of the Wowzer,\nwhom, from the restrictions of the crack, Jimmie Dale could not see.\nHe was conscious of a sickening sense of disaster.  His hope against\nhope had been in vain–the letter had been opened and read–THE\nIDENTITY OF THE GRAY SEAL WAS SOLVED.",
        "Dago Jim’s voice roared out, hoarse, blasphemous, in drunken rage:",
        "“De Gray Seal–see!  Youse betcher life I knows!  I been waitin’ fer\nsomet’ing like dis, damn youse!  Youse been stallin’ on me fer a\nyear every time it came to a divvy.  Youse’ve got a pocketful now\nyouse snitched to-night dat youse are tryin’ to do me out of.  Well,\nkeep ’em\"–he shoved his face forward.  “I keeps dis–see!  Keep ’em\nWowzer, youse cross-eyed–”",
        "“Everyt’ing I pinched to-night’s on de table dere wid wot youse\npinched yerself,” cut in the Wowzer, in a sullen, threatening growl.",
        "“Youse lie, an’ youse knows it!” retorted Dago Jim.  “Youse have\ngiven me de short end every time we’ve pulled a deal!”",
        "“Dat letter’s mine, youse–” bawled the Wowzer furiously.",
        "“Why didn’t youse open it an’ read it, den, instead of lettin’ me do\nit to keep me busy while youse short-changed me?” sneered Dago Jim.\n\"Youse t’ought it was some sweet billy-doo, eh?  Well, t’anks,\nWowzer–dat’s wot it is!  Say,” he mocked, “dere’s a guy’ll cash a\nt’ousand century notes fer dis, an’ if he don’t–say, dere’s SOME\nreward out fer the Gray Seal!  Wouldn’t youse like to know who it\nis?  Well, when I’m ridin’ in me private buzz wagon, Wowzer, youse\nstick around an’ mabbe I’ll tell youse–an’ mabbe I won’t!”",
        "“By God\"–the Wowzer’s voice rose in a scream–\"youse hand over dat\nletter!”",
        "“Youse go to–”",
        "Red, lurid red, a stream of flame seemed to cut across Jimmie Dale’s\nline of vision, came the roar of a revolver shot–and like a madman\nJimmie Dale flung his body at the door.  Rickety at best, it crashed\ninward, half wrenched from its hinges, precipitating him inside.  He\nrecovered himself and leaped forward.  The room was swirling with\nblue eddies of smoke; Dago Jim, hands flung up, still grasping\nletter and pocketbook, pawed at the air–and plunged with a sagging\nlurch face downward to the floor.  There was a yell and an oath from\nthe Wowzer–the crack of another revolver shot, the hum of the\nbullet past Jimmie Dale’s ear, the scorch of the tongue flame in his\nface, and he was upon the other.",
        "Screeching profanity, the Wowzer grappled; and, for an instant, the\ntwo men rocked, reeled, and swayed in each other’s embrace; then,\nboth men losing their balance, they shot suddenly backward, the\nWowzer, undermost, striking his head against the table’s edge–and\nmen, table, and lamp crashed downward in a heap to the floor.",
        "It had been no more, at most, than a matter of seconds since Jimmie\nDale had hurled himself into the room; and now, with a gurgling\nsigh, the Wowzer’s arms, that had been wound around Jimmie Dale’s\nback and shoulders, relaxed, and, from the blow on his head the man,\nlay back inert and stunned.  And then it seemed to Jimmie Dale as\nthough pandemonium, unreality, and chaos at the touch of some\ndevil’s hand reigned around him.  It was dark–no, not dark–a spurt\nof flame was leaping along the line of trickling oil from the broken\nlamp on the floor.  It threw into ghastly relief the sprawled form\nof Dago Jim.  Outside, from along the passageway, came a confused\njangle of commotion–whispering voices, shuffling feet, the swish of\nChinese garments.  And the room itself began to spring into weird,\nflickering shadows, that mounted and crept up the walls with the\nspreading fire.",
        "There was not a second to lose before the room would be swarming\nwith that rush from the passageway–and there was still the letter,\nthe pocketbook!  The table had fallen half over Dago Jim–Jimmie\nDale pushed it aside, tore the crushed letter and the pocketbook\nfrom the man’s hands–and felt, with a grim, horrible sort of\nanxiety, for the other’s heartbeat, for the verdict that meant life\nor death to himself.  There was no sign of life–the man was dead.",
        "Jimmie Dale was on his feet now.  A face, another, and another\nshowed in the doorway–the Wowzer was regaining his senses,\nstumbling to his knees.  There was one chance–just one–to take\nthose crowding figures by surprise.  And with a yell of “Fire!\"\nJimmie Dale sprang for the doorway.",
        "They gave way before his rush, tumbling back in their surprise\nagainst the opposite wall; and, turning, Jimmie Dale raced down the\npassageway.  Doors were opening everywhere now, forms were pushing\nout into the semi-darkness–only to duck hastily back again, as\nJimmie Dale’s automatic barked and spat a running fire of warning\nahead of him.  And then, behind, the Wowzer’s voice shrieked out:",
        "“Soak him!  Kill de guy!  He’s croaked Dago Jim!  Put a hole in him,\nde–”",
        "Yells, a chorus of them, took up the refrain–then the rush of\nfollowing feet–and the passageway seemed to racket as though a\nGatling gun were in play with the fusillade of revolver shots.  But\nJimmie Dale was at the opening now–and, like a base runner plunging\nfor the bag, he flung himself in a low dive through and into the\nopen cellar beyond.  He was on his feet, over the boxes, and dashing\nup the stairs in a second.  The door above opened as he reached the\ntop–Jimmie Dale’s right hand shot out with clubbed revolver–and\nwith a grunt Chang Foo went down before the blow and the headlong\nrush.  The next instant Jimmie Dale had sprung through the tea shop\nand was out on the street.",
        "A minute, two minutes more, and Chinatown would be in an uproar–\nChang Foo would see to that–and the Wowzer would prod him on.  The\ndanger was far from over yet.  And then, as he ran, Jimmie Dale gave\na little gasp of relief.  Just ahead, drawn up at the curb, stood a\ntaxicab–waiting, probably, for a private slumming party.  Jimmie\nDale put on a spurt, reached it, and wrenched the door open.",
        "“Quick!” he flung at the startled chauffeur.  “The nearest subway\nstation–there’s a ten-spot in it for you!  Quick man–QUICK!  Here\nthey come!”",
        "A crowd of Chinese, pouring like angry hornets from Chang Foo’s\nshop, came yelling down the street–and the taxi took the corner on\ntwo wheels–and Jimmie Dale, panting, choking for his breath like a\nman spent, sank back against the cushions.",
        "But five minutes later it was quite another Jimmie Dale, composed,\nnonchalant, imperturbable, who entered an up-town subway train, and,\nchoosing a seat alone near the centre of the car, which at that hour\nof night in the downtown district was almost deserted, took the\ncrushed letter from his pocket.  For a moment he made no attempt to\nread it, his dark eyes, now that he was free from observation, full\nof troubled retrospect, fixed on the window at his side.  It was not\na pleasant thought that it had cost a man his life, nor yet that\nthat life was also the price of his own freedom.  True, if there\nwere two men in the city of New York whose crimes merited neither\nsympathy nor mercy, those two men were the Wowzer and Dago Jim–but\nyet, after all, it was a human life, and, even if his own had been\nin the balance, thank God it had been through no act of his that\nDago Jim had gone out!  The Wowzer, cute and cunning, had been quick\nenough to say so to clear himself, but–Jimmie Dale smiled a little\nnow–neither the Wowzer, nor Chang Foo, nor Chinatown would ever be\nin a position to recognise their uninvited guest!",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes shifted to the letter speculatively, gravely.  It\nseemed as though the night had already held a year of happenings,\nand the night was not over yet–there was the letter!  It had\nalready cost one life; was it to cost another–or what?",
        "It began as it always did.  He read it through once, in amazement; a\nsecond time, with a flush of bitter anger creeping to his cheeks;\nand a third time, curiously memorising, as it were, snatches of it\nhere and there.",
        "“DEAR PHILANTHROPIC CROOK: Robbery of Hudson-Mercantile National\nBank–trusted employee is ex-convict, bad police record, served term\nin Sing Sing three years ago–known to police as Bookkeeper Bob,\nreal name is Robert Moyne, lives at –– Street, Harlem–Inspector\nBurton and Lannigan of headquarters trailing him now–robbery not\nyet made public–”",
        "There was a great deal more–four sheets of closely written data.\nWith an exclamation almost of dismay, Jimmie Dale pulled out his\nwatch.  So that was what Burton and Lannigan were up to!  And he had\nactually run into them!  Lord, the irony of it!  The–  And then\nJimmie Dale stared at the dial of his watch incredulously.  It was\nstill but barely midnight!  It seemed impossible that since leaving\nthe theatre at a few minutes before eleven, he had lived through but\na single hour!",
        "Jimmie Dale’s fingers began to pluck at the letter, tearing it into\npieces, tearing the pieces over and over again into tiny shreds.\nThe train stopped at station after station, people got on and off–\nJimmie Dale’s hat was over his eyes, and his eyes were glued again\nto the window.  Had Bookkeeper Bob returned to his flat in Harlem\nwith the detectives at his heels–or were Burton and Lannigan still\ntrailing the man downtown somewhere around the cafe’s?  If the\nformer, the theft of the letter and its incident loss of time had\nbeen an irreparable disaster; if the latter–well, who knew!  The\nrisk was the Gray Seal’s!",
        "At One Hundred and Twenty-Fifth Street Jimmie Dale left the train;\nand, at the end of a sharp four minutes’ walk, during which he had\ndodged in and out from street to street, stopped on a corner to\nsurvey the block ahead of him.  It was a block devoted exclusively\nto flats and apartment houses, and, apart from a few belated\npedestrians, was deserted.  Jimmie Dale strolled leisurely down one\nside, crossed the street at the end of the block, and strolled\nleisurely back on the other side–there was no sign of either Burton\nor Lannigan.  It was a fairly safe presumption then that Bookkeeper\nBob had not returned yet, or one of the detectives at least would\nhave been shadowing the house.",
        "Jimmie Dale, smiling a little grimly, retraced his steps again, and\nturned deliberately into a doorway–whose number he had noted as he\nhad passed a moment or so before.  So, after all, there was time\nyet!  This was the house.  “Number eighteen,” she had said in her\nletter.  “A flat–three stories–Moyne lives on ground floor.”",
        "Jimmie Dale leaned against the vestibule door–there was a faint\nclick–a little steel instrument was withdrawn from the lock–and\nJimmie Dale stepped into the hall, where a gas jet, turned down,\nburned dimly.",
        "The door of the ground-floor apartment was at his right, Jimmie Dale\nreached up and turned off the light.  Again those slim, tapering,\nwonderfully sensitive fingers worked with the little steel\ninstrument, this time in the lock of the apartment door–again there\nwas that almost inaudible click–and then cautiously, inch by inch,\nthe door opened under his hand.  He peered inside–down a hallway\nlighted, if it could be called lighted at all, by a subdued glow\nfrom two open doors that gave upon it–peered intently, listening\nintently, as he drew a black silk mask from his pocket and slipped\nit over his face.  And then, silent as a shadow in his movements,\nthe door left just ajar behind him, he stole down the carpeted\nhallway.",
        "Opposite the first of the open doorways Jimmie Dale paused–a\ncuriously hard expression creeping over his face, his lips beginning\nto droop ominously downward at the corners.  It was a little sitting\nroom, cheaply but tastefully furnished, and a young woman,\nBookkeeper Bob’s wife evidently, and evidently sitting up for her\nhusband, had fallen sound asleep in a chair, her head pillowed on\nher arms that were outstretched across the table.  For a moment\nJimmie Dale held there, his eyes on the scene–and the next moment,\nhis hand curved into a clenched fist, he had passed on and entered\nthe adjoining room.",
        "It was a child’s bedroom.  A night lamp burned on a table beside the\nbed, and the soft rays seemed to play and linger in caress on the\ntousled golden hair of a little girl of perhaps two years of age–\nand something seemed to choke suddenly in Jimmie Dale’s throat–the\nsweet, innocent little face, upturned to his, was smiling at him as\nshe slept.",
        "Jimmie Dale turned away his head–his eyelashes wet under his mask.\n\"BENEATH THE MATTRESS OF THE CHILD’S BED,” the letter had said.  His\nface like stone, his lips a thin line now, Jimmie Dale’s hand\nreached deftly in without disturbing the child and took out a\npackage–and then another.  He straightened up, a bundle of crisp\nnew hundred-dollar notes in each hand–and on the top of one,\nslipped under the elastic band that held the bills together, an\nunsealed envelope.  He drew out the latter, and opened it–it was a\nsecond-class steamship passage to Vera Cruz, made out in a\nfictitious name, of course, to John Davies, the booking for next\nday’s sailing.  From the ticket, from the stolen money, Jimmie\nDale’s eyes lifted to rest again on the little golden head, the\nsmiling lips–and then, dropping the packages into his pockets, his\nown lips moving queerly, he turned abruptly to the door.",
        "“My God, the shame of it!” he whispered to himself.",
        "He crept down the corridor, past the open door of the room where the\nyoung woman still sat fast asleep, and, his mask in his pocket\nagain, stepped softly into the vestibule, and from there to the\nstreet.",
        "Jimmie Dale hurried now, spurred on it seemed by a hot, insensate\nfury that raged within him–there was still one other call to make\nthat night–still those remaining and minute details in the latter\npart of her letter, grim and ugly in their portent!",
        "It was close upon one o’clock in the morning when Jimmie Dale\nstopped again–this time before a fashionable dwelling just off\nCentral Park.  And here, for perhaps the space of a minute, he\nsurveyed the house from the sidewalk–watching, with a sort of\nspeculative satisfaction, a man’s shadow that passed constantly to\nand fro across the drawn blinds of one of the lower windows.  The\nrest of the house was in darkness.",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale, nodding his head, “I rather thought so.\nThe servants will have retired hours ago.  It’s safe enough.”",
        "He ran quickly up the steps and rang the bell.  A door opened almost\ninstantly, sending a faint glow into the hall from the lighted room;\na hurried step crossed the hall–and the outer door was thrown back.",
        "“Well, what is it?” demanded a voice brusquely.",
        "It was quite dark, too dark for either to distinguish the other’s\nfeatures–and Jimmie Dale’s hat was drawn far down over his eyes.",
        "“I want to see Mr. Thomas H. Carling, cashier of the Hudson-\nMercantile National Bank–it’s very important,” said Jimmie Dale\nearnestly.",
        "“I am Mr. Carling,” replied the other.  “What is it?”",
        "Jimmie Dale leaned forward.",
        "“From headquarters–with a report,” he said, in a low tone.",
        "“Ah!” exclaimed the bank official sharply.  “Well, it’s about time!\nI’ve been waiting up for it–though I expected you would telephone\nrather than this.  Come in!”",
        "“Thank you,” said Jimmie Dale courteously–and stepped into the\nhall.",
        "The other closed the front door.  “The servants are in bed, of\ncourse,” he explained, as he led the way toward the lighted room.\n\"This way, please.”",
        "Behind the other, across the hall, Jimmie Dale followed and close at\nCarling’s heels entered the room, which was fitted up, quite\nevidently regardless of cost, as a combination library and study.\nCarling, in a somewhat pompous fashion, walked straight ahead toward\nthe carved-mahogany flat-topped desk, and, as he reached it, waved\nhis hand.",
        "“Take a chair,” he said, over his shoulder–and then, turning in the\nact of dropping into his own chair, grasped suddenly at the edge of\nthe desk instead, and, with a low, startled cry, stared across the\nroom.",
        "Jimmie Dale was leaning back against the door that was closed now\nbehind him–and on Jimmie Dale’s face was a black silk mask.",
        "For an instant neither man spoke nor moved; then Carling, spare-\nbuilt, dapper in evening clothes, edged back from the desk and\nlaughed a little uncertainly.",
        "“Quite neat!  I compliment you!  From headquarters with a report, I\nthink you said?”",
        "“Which I neglected to add,” said Jimmie Dale, “was to be made in\nprivate.”",
        "Carling, as though to put as much distance between them as possible,\ncontinued to edge back across the room–but his small black eyes,\nblack now to the pupils themselves, never left Jimmie Dale’s face.",
        "“In private, eh?\"–he seemed to be sparring for time, as he smiled.\n\"In private!  You’ve a strange method of securing privacy, haven’t\nyou?  A bit melodramatic, isn’t it?  Perhaps you’ll be good enough\nto tell me who you are?”",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled indulgently.",
        "“My mask is only for effect,” he said.  “My name is–Smith.”",
        "“Yes,” said Carling.  “I am very stupid.  Thank you.  I–” he had\nreached the other side of the room now–and with a quick, sudden\nmovement jerked his hand to the dial of the safe that stood against\nthe wall.",
        "But Jimmie Dale was quicker–without shifting his position, his\nautomatic, whipped from his pocket, held a disconcerting bead on\nCarling’s forehead.",
        "“Please don’t do that,” said Jimmie Dale softly.  “It’s rather a\ngood make, that safe.  I dare say it would take me half an hour to\nopen it.  I was rather curious to know whether it was locked or\nnot.”",
        "Carling’s hand dropped to his side.",
        "“So!” he sneered.  “That’s it, is it!  The ordinary variety of sneak\nthief!”  His voice was rising gradually.  “Well, sir, let me tell\nyou that–”",
        "“Mr. Carling,” said Jimmie Dale, in a low, even tone, unless you\nmoderate your voice some one in the house might hear you–I am quite\nwell aware of that.  But if that happens, if any one enters this\nroom, if you make a move to touch a button, or in any other way\nattempt to attract attention, I’ll drop you where you stand!”  His\nhand, behind his back, extracted the key from the door lock, held it\nup for the other to see, then dropped it into his pocket–and his\nvoice, cold before, rang peremptorily now.  “Come back to the desk\nand sit down in that chair!” he ordered.",
        "For a moment Carling hesitated; then, with a half-muttered oath,\nobeyed.",
        "Jimmie Dale moved over, and stood in front of Carling on the other\nside of the desk–and stared silently at the immaculate, fashionably\ngroomed figure before him.",
        "Under the prolonged gaze, Carling’s composure, in a measure at\nleast, seemed to forsake him.  He began to drum nervously with his\nfingers on the desk, and shift uneasily in his chair.",
        "And then, from first one pocket and then the other, Jimmie Dale took\nthe two packages of banknotes, and, still with out a word, pushed\nthem across the desk until they lay under the other’s eyes.",
        "Carling’s fingers stopped their drumming, slid to the desk edge,\ntightened there, and a whiteness crept into his face.  Then, with an\neffort, he jerked himself erect in his chair.",
        "“What’s this?” he demanded hoarsely.",
        "“About ten thousand dollars, I should say,” said Jimmie Dale slowly.\n\"I haven’t counted it.  Your bank was robbed this evening at closing\ntime, I understand?”",
        "“Yes!”  Carling’s voice was excited now, the colour back in his\nface.  “But you–how–do you mean that you are returning the money\nto the bank?”",
        "“Exactly,” said Jimmie Dale.",
        "Carling was once more the pompous bank official.  He leaned back and\nsurveyed Jimmie Dale critically with his little black eyes.",
        "“Ah, quite so!” he observed.  “That accounts for the mask.  But I am\nstill a little in the dark.  Under the circumstances, it is quite\nimpossible that you should have stolen the money yourself, and–”",
        "“I didn’t,” said Jimmie Dale.  “I found it hidden in the home of one\nof your employees.”",
        "“You found it–WHERE?”",
        "“In Moyne’s home–up in Harlem.”",
        "“Moyne, eh?”  Carling was alert, quick now, jerking out his words.\n\"How did you come to get into this, then?  His pal?  Double-crossing\nhim, eh?  I suppose you want a reward–we’ll attend to that, of\ncourse.  You’re wiser than you know, my man.  That’s what we\nsuspected.  We’ve had the detectives trailing Moyne all evening.\"\nHe reached forward over the desk for the telephone.  “I’ll telephone\nheadquarters to make the arrest at once.”",
        "“Just a minute,” interposed Jimmie Dale gravely.  “I want you to\nlisten to a little story first.”",
        "“A story!  What has a story got to do with this?” snapped Carling.",
        "“The man has got a home,” said Jimmie Dale softly.  “A home, and a\nwife–and a little baby girl.”",
        "“Oh, that’s the game then, eh?  You want to plead for him?”  Carling\nflung out gruffly.  “Well, he should have thought of all that\nbefore!  It’s quite useless for you to bring it up.  The man has had\nhis chance already–a better chance than any one with his record\never had before.  We took him into the bank knowing that he was an\nex-convict, but believing that we could make an honest man of him–\nand this is the result.”",
        "“And yet–”",
        "“NO!” said Carling icily.",
        "“You refuse–absolutely?”  Jimmie Dale’s voice had a lingering,\nwistful note in it.",
        "“I refuse!” said Carling bluntly.  “I won’t have anything to do with\nit.”",
        "There was just an instant’s silence; and then, with a strange, slow,\ncreeping motion, as a panther creeps when about to spring, Jimmie\nDale projected his body across the desk–far across it toward the\nother.  And the muscles of his jaw were quivering, his words\nrasping, choked with the sweep of fury that, held back so long,\nbroke now in a passionate surge.",
        "“And shall I tell you why you won’t?  Your bank was robbed to-night\nof one hundred thousand dollars.  There are ten thousand here.  THE\nOTHER NINETY THOUSAND ARE IN YOUR SAFE!”",
        "“You lie!”  Ashen to the lips, Carling had risen in his chair.  “You\nlie!” he cried.  “Do you hear!  You lie!  I tell you, you lie!”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s lips parted ominously.",
        "“Sit down!” he gritted between his teeth.",
        "The white in Carling’s face had turned to gray, his lips were\nworking–mechanically he sank down again in his chair.",
        "Jimmie Dale still leaned over the desk, resting his weight on his\nright elbow, the automatic in his right hand covering Carling.",
        "“You cur!” whispered Jimmie Dale.  “There’s just one reason, only\none, that keeps me from putting a bullet through you while you sit\nthere.  We’ll get to that in a moment.  There is that little story\nfirst–shall I tell it to you now?  For the past four years, and God\nknows how many before that, you’ve gone the pace.  The lavishness of\nthis bachelor establishment of yours is common talk in New York–far\nin excess of a bank cashier’s salary.  But you were supposed to be a\nwealthy man in your own right; and so, in reality you were–once.\nBut you went through your fortune two years ago.  Counted a model\ncitizen, an upright man, an honour to the community–what were you,\nCarling?  What ARE you?  Shall I tell you?  Roue, gambler, leading a\ndouble life of the fastest kind.  You did it cleverly, Carling; hid\nit well–but your game is up.  To-night, for instance, you are at\nthe end of your tether, swamped with debts, exposure threatening you\nat any moment.  Why don’t you tell me again that I lie–Carling?”",
        "But now the man made no answer.  He had sunk a little deeper in his\nchair–a dawning look of terror in the eyes that held, fascinated,\non Jimmie Dale.",
        "“You cur!” said Jimmie Dale again.  “You cur, with your devil’s\nwork!  A year ago you saw this night coming–when you must have\nmoney, or face ruin and exposure.  You saw it then, a year ago, the\nday that Moyne, concealing nothing of his prison record, applied\nthrough friends for a position in the bank.  Your co-officials were\nopposed to his appointment, but you, do you remember how you pleaded\nto give the man his chance–and in your hellish ingenuity saw your\nway then out of the trap!  An ex-convict from Sing Sing!  It was\nenough, wasn’t it?  What chance had he!”  Jimmie Dale paused, his\nleft hand clenched until the skin formed whitish knobs over the\nknuckles.",
        "Carling’s tongue sought his lips, made a circuit of them–and he\ntried to speak, but his voice was an incoherent muttering.",
        "“I’ll not waste words,” said Jimmie Dale, in his grim monotone.\n\"I’m not sure enough myself–that I could keep my hands off you much\nlonger.  The actual details of how you stole the money to-day do not\nmatter–NOW.  A little later perhaps in court–but not now.  You\nwere the last to leave the bank, but before leaving you pretended to\ndiscover the theft of a hundred thousand dollars–that, done up in a\npaper parcel, was even then reposing in your desk.  You brought the\nparcel home, put it in that safe there–and notified the president\nof the bank by telephone from here of the robbery, suggesting that\npolice headquarters be advised at once.  He told you to go ahead and\nact as you saw best.  You notified the police, speciously directing\nsuspicion to–the ex-convict in the bank’s employ.  You knew Moyne\nwas dining out to-night, you knew where–and at a hint from you the\npolice took up the trail.  A little later in the evening, you took\nthese two packages of banknotes from the rest, and with this\nsteamship ticket–which you obtained yesterday while out at lunch by\nsending a district messenger boy with the money and instructions in\na sealed envelope to purchase for you–you went up to the Moynes’\nflat in Harlem for the purpose of secreting them somewhere there.\nYou pretended to be much disappointed at finding Moyne out–you had\njust come for a little social visit, to get better acquainted with\nthe home life of your employees!  Mrs. Moyne was genuinely pleased\nand grateful.  She took you in to see their little girl, who was\nalready asleep in bed.  She left you there for a moment to answer\nthe door–and you–you\"–Jimmie Dale’s voice choked again–\"you blot\non God’s earth, you slipped the money and ticket under the child’s\nmattress!”",
        "Carling came forward with a lurch in his chair–and his hands went\nout, pawing in a wild, pleading fashion over Jimmie Dale’s arm.",
        "Jimmie Dale flung him away.",
        "“You were safe enough,” he rasped on.  “The police could only\nconstrue your visit to Moyne’s flat as zeal on behalf of the bank.\nAnd it was safer, much more circumspect on your part, not to order\nthe flat searched at once, but only as a last resort, as it were,\nafter you had led the police to trail him all evening and still\nremain without a clew–and besides, of course, not until you had\nplanted the evidence that was to damn him and wreck his life and\nhome!  You were even generous in the amount you deprived yourself of\nout of the hundred thousand dollars–for less would have been\nenough.  Caught with ten thousand dollars of the bank’s money and a\nsteamship ticket made out in a fictitious name, it was prima-facie\nevidence that he had done the job and had the balance somewhere.\nWhat would his denials, his protestations of innocence count for?\nHe was an ex-convict, a hardened criminal caught red-handed with a\nportion of the proceeds of robbery–he had succeeded in hiding the\nremainder of it too cleverly, that was all.”",
        "Carling’s face was ghastly.  His hands went out again–again his\ntongue moistened his dry lips.  He whispered:",
        "“Isn’t–isn’t there some–some way we can fix this?”",
        "And then Jimmie Dale laughed–not pleasantly.",
        "“Yes, there’s a way, Carling,” he said grimly.  “That’s why I’m\nhere.”  He picked up a sheet of writing paper and pushed it across\nthe desk–then a pen, which he dipped into the inkstand, and\nextended to the other.  “The way you’ll fix it will be to write out\na confession exonerating Moyne.”",
        "Carling shrank back into his chair, his head huddling into his\nshoulders.",
        "“NO!” he cried.  “I won’t–I can’t–my God!–I–I–WON’T!”",
        "The automatic in Jimmie Dale’s hand edged forward the fraction of an\ninch.",
        "“I have not used this–yet.  You understand now why–don’t you?” he\nsaid under his breath.",
        "“No, no!” Carling pushed away the pen.  “I’m ruined–ruined as it\nis.  But this would mean the penitentiary, too–”",
        "“Where you tried to send an innocent man in your place, you hound;\nwhere you–”",
        "“Some other way–some other way!”  Carling was babbling.  “Let me\nout of this–for God’s sake, let me out of this!”",
        "“Carling,” said Jimmie Dale hoarsely, “I stood beside a little bed\nto-night and looked at a baby girl–a little baby girl with golden\nhair, who smiled as she slept.”",
        "Carling shivered, and passed a shaking hand across his face.",
        "“Take this pen,” said Jimmie Dale monotonously; “or–THIS!”  The\nautomatic lifted until the muzzle was on a line with Carling’s eyes.",
        "Carling’s hand reached out, still shaking, and took the pen; and his\nbody, dragged limply forward, hung over the desk.  The pen\nspluttered on the paper–a bead of sweat spurting from the man’s\nforehead dropped to the sheet.",
        "There was silence in the room.  A minute passed–another. Carling’s\npen travelled haltingly across the paper then, with a queer, low cry\nas he signed his name, he dropped the pen from his fingers, and,\nrising unsteadily from his chair, stumbled away from the desk toward\na couch across the room.",
        "An instant Jimmie Dale watched the other, then he picked up the\nsheet of paper.  It was a miserable document, miserably scrawled:",
        "“I guess it’s all up.  I guess I knew it would be some day.  Moyne\nhadn’t anything to do with it.  I stole the money myself from the\nbank to-night.  I guess it’s all up.",
        "Thomas H. Carling.”",
        "From the paper, Jimmie Dale’s eyes shifted to the figure by the\ncouch–and the paper fluttered suddenly from his fingers to the\ndesk. Carling was reeling, clutching at his throat–a small glass\nvial rolled upon the carpet.  And then, even as Jimmie Dale sprang\nforward, the other pitched head long over the couch–and in a moment\nit was over.",
        "Presently Jimmie Dale picked up the vial–and dropped it back on the\nfloor again.  There was no label on it, but it needed none–the\nstrong, penetrating odor of bitter almonds was telltale evidence\nenough.  It was prussic, or hydrocyanic acid, probably the most\ndeadly poison and the swiftest in its action that was known to\nscience–Carling had provided against that “some day” in his\nconfession!",
        "For a little space, motionless, Jimmie Dale stood looking down at\nthe silent, outstretched form–then he walked slowly back to the\ndesk, and slowly, deliberately picked up the signed confession and\nthe steamship ticket.  He held them an instant, staring at them,\nthen methodically began to tear them into little pieces, a strange,\ntired smile hovering on his lips.  The man was dead now–there would\nbe disgrace enough for some one to bear, a mother perhaps–who knew!\nAnd there was another way now–since the man was dead.",
        "Jimmie Dale put the pieces in his pocket, went to the safe, opened\nit, and took out a parcel, locked the safe carefully, and carried\nthe parcel to the desk.  He opened it there.  Inside were nearly two\ndozen little packages of hundred-dollar bills.  The other two\npackages that he had brought with him he added to the rest.  From\nhis pocket he took out the thin metal insignia case, and with the\ntiny tweezers lifted up one of the gray-coloured, diamond-shaped\npaper seals.  He moistened the adhesive side, and, still holding it\nby the tweezers, dropped it on his handkerchief and pressed the seal\ndown on the face of the topmost package of banknotes.  He tied the\nparcel up then, and, picking up the pen, addressed it in printed\ncharacters:",
        "Hudson-Mercantile National Bank,",
        "New York City.",
        "“District messenger–some way–in the morning,” he murmured.",
        "Jimmie Dale slipped his mask into his pocket, and, with the parcel\nunder his arm, stepped to the door and unlocked it.  He paused for\nan instant on the threshold for a single, quick, comprehensive\nglance around the room–then passed on out into the street.",
        "At the corner he stopped to light a cigarette–and the flame of the\nmatch spurting up disclosed a face that was worn and haggard.  He\nthrew the match away, smiled a little wearily–and went on.",
        "The Gray Seal had committed another “crime.”",
        "Choosing between the snowy napery, the sparkling glass and silver,\nthe cozy, shaded table-lamps, the famous French chef of the ultra-\nexclusive St. James Club, his own home on Riverside Drive where a\ndinner fit for an epicure and served by Jason, that most perfect of\nbutlers, awaited him, and Marlianne’s, Jimmie Dale, driving in alone\nin his touring car from an afternoon’s golf, had chosen–\nMarlianne’s.",
        "Marlianne’s, if such a thing as Bohemianism, or, rather, a concrete\nexpression of it exists, was Bohemian.  A two-piece string\norchestra played valiantly to the accompaniment of a hoarse-throated\npiano; and between courses the diners took up the refrain–and, as\nit was always between courses with some one, the place was a bedlam\nof noisy riot.  Nevertheless, it was Marlianne’s–and Jimmie Dale\nliked Marlianne’s.  He had dined there many times before, as he had\njust dined in the person of Jimmie Dale, the millionaire, his high-\npriced imported car at the curb of the shabby street outside–and he\nhad dined there, disreputable in attire, seedy in appearance, with\nthe police yelping at his heels, as Larry the Bat.  In either\ncharacter Marlianne’s had welcomed him with equal courtesy to its\nspotted linen and most excellent table-d’hote with VIN ORDINAIRE–\nfor fifty cents.",
        "And now, in the act of reaching into his pocket for the change to\npay his bill, Jimmie Dale seemed suddenly to experience some\ndifficulty in finding what he sought, and his fingers went fumbling\nfrom one pocket to another.  Two men at the table in front of him\nwere talking–their voices, over a momentary lull in violin squeaks,\ntalk, laughter, singing, and the clatter of dishes, reached him:",
        "“Carling commit suicide!  Not on your life!  No; of course he\ndidn’t!  It was that cursed Gray Seal croaked him, just as sure as\nyou sit in that chair!”",
        "The other grunted.  “Yes; but what’d the Gray Seal want to pinch a\nhundred thousand out of the bank for, and then give it back again\nthe next morning?”",
        "“What’s he done a hundred other things for to cover up the real\nobject of what he’s after?” retorted the first speaker, with a\nshort, vicious laugh; then, with a thump of his fist on the table:\n\"The man’s a devil, a fiend, and anywhere else but New York he’d\nhave been caught and sent to the chair where he belongs long ago,\nand–”",
        "A burst of ragtime drowned out the man’s words.  Jimmie Dale placed\na fifty-cent piece and a tip beside it on his dinner check, pushed\nback his chair, and rose from the table.  There was a half-\ntolerantly satirical, half-angry glint in his dark, steady eyes.  It\nwas not only the police who yelped at his heels, but every man,\nwoman, and child in the city.  The man had not voiced his own\nsentiments–he had voiced the sentiments of New York!  And it was\nquite on the cards that if he, Jimmie Dale, were ever caught his\ndestination would not even be the death cell and the chair at Sing\nSing–his fellow citizens had reached a pitch where they would be\nquite capable of literally tearing him to pieces if they ever got\ntheir hands on him!",
        "And yet there were a few, a very few, a handful out of five\nmillions, who sometimes remembered perhaps to thank God that the\nGray Seal lived–that was his reward.  That–and SHE, whose\nmysterious letters prompted and impelled his, the Gray Seal’s, acts!\nShe–nameless, fascinating in her brilliant resourcefulness, amazing\nin her power, a woman whose life was bound up with his and yet held\napart from him in the most inexplicable, absorbing way; a woman he\nhad never seen, save for her gloved arm in the limousine that night,\nwho at one unexpected moment projected a dazzling, impersonal\nexistence across his path, and the next, leaving him battling for\nhis life where greed and passion and crime swirled about him, was\ngone!",
        "Jimmie Dale threaded the small, crowded rooms–the interior of\nMarlianne’s had never been altered from the days when the place had\nbeen a family residence of some pretension–and, reaching the hall,\nreceived his hat from the frowsy-looking boy in attendance.  He\npassed outside, and, at the top of the steps, paused as he took his\ncigarette case from his pocket.  It was nearly a week since Carling,\nthe cashier of the Hudson-Mercantile National Bank, had been found\ndead in his home, a bottle that had contained hydrocyanic acid on\nthe floor beside him; nearly a week since Bookkeeper Bob, unaware\nthat he had ever been under temporary suspicion for the robbery of\nthe bank, had, equally unknown to himself, been cleared of any\ncomplicity in that affair–and yet, as witness the conversation of a\nmoment ago, it was still the topic of New York, still the vital\nissue that filled the maw of the newspapers with ravings, threats,\nand execrations against the Gray Seal, snarling virulently the while\nat the police for the latter’s ineptitude, inefficiency, and\nimpotence!",
        "Jimmie Dale closed his cigarette case with a snap that was almost\nhuman in its irony, dropped it back into his pocket, and lighted a\nmatch–but the flame was arrested halfway to the tip of his\ncigarette, as his eyes fixed suddenly and curiously on a woman’s\nform hurrying down the street.  She had turned the corner before he\ntook his eyes from her, and the match between his fingers had gone\nout.  Not that there was anything very strange in a woman walking,\nor even half running, along the street; nor that there was anything\nparticularly attractive or unusual about her, and if there had been\nthe street was too dark for him to have distinguished it.  It was\nnot that–it was the fact that she had neither passed by the house\non whose steps he stood, nor come out of any of the adjoining\nhouses.  It was as though she had suddenly and miraculously appeared\nout of thin air, and taken form on a sidewalk a little way down from\nMarlianne’s.",
        "“That’s queer!” commented Jimmie Dale to himself.  “However–”  He\ntook out another match, lighted his cigarette, jerked the match stub\naway from him, and, with a lift of his shoulders, went down the\nsteps.",
        "He crossed the pavement, walked around the front of his machine,\nsince the steering wheel was on the side next to the curb, and, with\nhis hand out to open the car door–stopped.  Some one had been\ntampering with it–it was not quite closed.  There was no mistake.\nJimmie Dale made no mistakes of that kind, a man whose life hung a\ndozen times a day on little things could not afford to make them.\nHe had closed it firmly, even with a bang, when he had got out.",
        "Instantly suspicious, he wrenched the door wide open, switched on\nthe light under the hood, and, with a sharp exclamation, bent\nquickly forward.  A glove, a woman’s glove, a white glove lay on the\nfloor of the car.  Jimmie Dale’s pulse leaped suddenly into fierce,\npounding beats.  It was HERS!  He KNEW that intuitively–knew it as\nhe knew that he breathed.  And that woman he had so leisurely\nwatched as she had disappeared from sight was, must have been–she!",
        "He sprang from the car with a jump, his first impulse to dash after\nher–and checked himself, laughing a little bitterly.  It was too\nlate for that now–he had already let his chance slip through his\nfingers.  Around the corner was Sixth Avenue, surface cars, the\nelevated, taxicabs, a multitude of people, any one of a hundred ways\nin which she could, and would, already have discounted pursuit from\nhim–and, besides, he would not even have been able to recognise her\nif he saw her!",
        "Jimmie Dale’s smile was mirthless as he turned back to the car, and\npicked up the glove.  Why had she dropped it there?  It could not\nhave been intentional.  Why had–he began to tear suddenly at the\nglove’s little finger, and in another second, kneeling on the car’s\nstep, his shoulders inside, he was holding a ring close under the\nlittle electric bulb.",
        "It was a gold seal ring, a small, dainty thing that bore a crest: a\nbell, surmounted by a bishop’s mitre–the bell, quaint in design,\nharking the imagination back to some old-time belfry tower.  And\nunderneath, in the scroll–a motto.  It was a full minute before\nJimmie Dale could decipher it, for the lettering was minute and the\nwords, of course, reversed.  It was in French: SONNEZ LE TOCSIN.",
        "He straightened up, the glove and ring in his hand, a puzzled\nexpression on his face.  It was strange!  Had she, after all,\ndropped the glove there intentionally; had she at last let down the\nbarriers just a little between them, and given him this little\nintimate sign that she–",
        "And then Jimmie Dale laughed abruptly, self-mockingly.  He was only\ntrying to deceive himself, to argue himself into believing what,\nwith heart and soul, he wanted to believe.  It was not like her–and\nneither was it so!  His eyes had fixed on the seat beside the wheel.\nHe had not used the lap rug all that day, he couldn’t use a rug and\ndrive, he had left it folded and hanging on the rack in the tonneau–\nit was now neatly folded and reposing on the front seat!",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale, a sort of self-pity in his tones, “I might\nhave known.”",
        "He lifted the rug.  Beneath it on the leather seat lay a white\nenvelope.  Her letter!  The letter that never came save with the\nplan of some grim, desperate work outlined ahead–the call to arms\nfor the Gray Seal.  SONNEZ LE TOCSIN!  Ring the Tocsin!  Sound the\nalarm!  The Tocsin!  The words were running through his brain.  A\nstrange motto on that crest–that seemed so strangely apt!  The\nTocsin!  Never once in all the times that he had heard from her,\nnever once in the years that had gone since that initial letter of\nhers had struck its first warning note, had any communication from\nher been but to sound again a new alarm–the Toscin!  The Tocsin–\nthe word seemed to visualise her, to give her a concrete form and\nbeing, to breathe her very personality.",
        "“The Tocsin!\"–Jimmie Dale whispered the word softly, a little\nwistfully.  “Yes; I shall call you that–the Tocsin!”",
        "He folded the glove very carefully, placed it with the ring in his\npocketbook, picked up the letter–and, with a sharp exclamation,\nturned it quickly over in his fingers, then bent hurriedly with it\nto the light.",
        "Strange things were happening that night!  For the first time, the\nletter was not even SEALED!  That was not like her, either!  What\ndid it mean?  Quick, alert now, anxious even, he pulled the double,\nfolded sheets from the envelope, glanced rapidly through them–and,\nafter a moment, a smile, whimsical, came slowly to his lips.",
        "It was quite plain now–all of it.  The glove, the ring, and the\nunsealed letter–and the postscript held the secret; or, rather,\nwhat had been intended for a postscript did, for it comprised only a\nfew words, ending abruptly, unfinished: “Look in the cupboard at the\nrear of the room.  The man with the red wig is–”  That was all, and\nthe words, written in ink, were badly blurred, as though the paper\nhad been hastily folded before the ink was dry.",
        "It was quite plain; and, in view of the real explanation of it all,\neminently characteristic of her.  With the letter already written,\nshe had come there, meaning to place it on the seat and cover it\nwith the rug, as, indeed, she had done; then, deciding to add the\npostscript, and because she would attract less attention that way\nthan in any other, she had climbed into the car as though it\nbelonged to her, and had seated herself there to write it.  She\nwould have been hurried in her movements, of course, and in pulling\noff her glove to use the fountain pen the ring had come with it.\nThe rest was obvious.  She had but just begun to write when he had\nappeared on the steps.  She had slipped instantly down to the floor\nof the car, probably dropping the glove from her lap, hastily\ninclosed the letter in the envelope which she had no time to seal,\nthrust the envelope under the rug, and, forgetting her glove and\nfearful of risking his attention by attempting to close the door\nfirmly, had stolen along the body of the car, only to be noticed by\nhim too late–when she was well down the street!",
        "And at that latter thought, once more chagrin seized Jimmie Dale–\nthen he turned impulsively to the letter.  All this was extraneous,\napart–for another time, when every moment was not a priceless asset\nas it very probably was now.",
        "“Dear Philanthropic Crook\"–it always began that way, never any\nother way.  He read on more and more intently, crouched there close\nto the light on the floor of his car, lips thinning as he proceeded–\nread it to the end, absorbing, memorising it–and then the abortive\npostscript:",
        "“Look in the cupboard at the rear of the room.  The man with the red\nwig is–”",
        "For an instant, as mechanically he tore the letter into little\nshreds, he held there hesitant–and the next, slamming the door\ntight, he flung himself into the seat behind the wheel, and the big,\nsixty-horse-power, self-starting machine was roaring down the\nstreet.",
        "The Tocsin!  There was a grim smile on Jimmie Dale’s lips now.  The\nalarm!  Yes, it was always an alarm, quick, sudden, an emergency to\nface on the instant–plans, decisions to be made with no time to\nponder them, with only that one fact to consider, staggering enough\nin itself, that a mistake meant disaster and ruin to some one else,\nand to himself, if the courts were merciful where he had little hope\nfor mercy, the penitentiary for life!",
        "And now to-night again, as it almost always was when these\nmysterious letters came, every moment of inaction was piling up the\nodds against him.  And, too, the same problem confronted him.  How,\nin what way, in what role, must he play the night’s game to its end?\nAs Larry the Bat?",
        "The car was speeding forward.  He was heading down Broadway now,\nlower Broadway, that stretched before him, deserted like some dark,\nnarrow canyon where, far below, like towering walls, the buildings\nclosed together and seemed to converge into some black, impassable\nbarrier.  The street lights flashed by him; a patrolman stopped the\nswinging of his night-stick, and turned to gaze at the car that\nrushed by at a rate perilously near to contempt of speed laws;\nstreet cars passed at indifferent intervals; pedestrians were few\nand far between–it was the lower Broadway of night.",
        "Larry the Bat?  Jimmie Dale shook his head impatiently over the\nsteering wheel.  No; that would not do.  It would be well enough for\nthis young Burton, perhaps, but not for old Isaac, the East Side\nfence–for Isaac knew him in the character of Larry the Bat.  His\nquick, keen brain, weaving, eliminating, devising, scheming,\ndiscarded that idea.  The final coup of the night, as yet but sensed\nin an indefinite, unshaped way, if enacted in the person of Larry\nthe Bat would therefore stamp Larry the Bat and the Gray Seal as\none–a contretemps but little less fatal, in view of old Issac, than\nto bracket the Gray Seal and Jimmie Dale!  Larry the Bat was not a\ncharacter to be assumed with impunity, nor one to jeopardize–it was\na bulwark of safety, at it were, to which more than once he owed\nescape from capture and discovery.",
        "He lifted his shoulders with a sudden jerk of decision as the car\nswerved to the left and headed for the East Side.  There was only\none alternative then–the black silk mask that folded into such tiny\ncompass, and that, together with an automatic and the curious, thin\nmetal case that looked so like a cigarette case, was always in his\npocket for an emergency!",
        "The car turned again, and, approaching its destination, Jimmie Dale\nslowed down the speed perceptibly.  It was a strange case, not a\npleasant one–and the raw edges where they showed were ugly in their\nnakedness.  Old Isaac Pelina, young Burton, and Maddon–K.\nWilmington Maddon, the wall-paper magnate!  Curious, that of the\nthree he should already know two–old Isaac and Maddon!  Everybody in\nthe East Side, every denizen of the underworld, and many who posed\non a far higher plane knew old Isaac–fence to the most select\nclientele of thieves in New York, unscrupulous, hand in glove with\nany rascality or crime that promised profit, a money lender, a\nShylock without even a Shylock’s humanity as a saving grace!  Yes;\nas Larry the Bat he knew old Isaac, and he knew him not only\npersonally but by firsthand reputation–he had heard the man cursed\nin blasphemous, whole-souled abandon by more than one crook who was\nin the old fence’s toils.  They dealt with him, the crooks, while\nthey swore to “get” him because he was “safe,” but–Jimmie Dale’s\nlips parted in a mirthless smile–some day old Isaac would be found\nin that spiders’ den of his back of the dingy loan office with a\nknife in his heart or a bullet through his head!  And K. Wilmington\nMaddon–Jimmie Dale’s smile grew whimsical–he had known Maddon\nquite intimately for years, had even dined with him at the St. James\nClub only a few nights before.  Maddon was a man in his own “set\"–\nand Maddon, interfered with, was likely to prove none too tractable\na customer to handle.  And young Burton, the letter had said, was\nMaddon’s private and confidential secretary.  Jimmie Dale’s lips\nthinned again.  Well, Burton’s acquaintance was still to be made!\nIt was a curious trio–and it was dirty work, more raw than cunning,\nmore devilish than ingenious; blackmail in its most hellish form;\nthe stake, at the least calculation, a cool half million.  A heavy\nprice for a single slip in a man’s life!",
        "He brought the car abruptly to a halt at the edge of the curb, and\nsprang out to the ground.  He was in front of “The Budapest\"\nrestaurant, a garish establishment, most popular of all resorts for\nthe moment on the East Side, where Fifth Avenue, in the fond belief\nthat it was seeing the real thing in “seamy” life, engaged its table\na week in advance.  Jimmie Dale pushed a bill into the door\nattendant’s hand, accompanied by an injunction to keep an eye on the\nmachine, and entered the cafe.",
        "But for a sort of tinselled ostentation the place might well have\nbeen the Marlianne’s that he had just left–it was crowded and riot\nwas at its height; a stringed orchestra in Hungarian costume played\nwhat purported to be Hungarian airs; shouts, laughter, clatter of\ndishes, and thump of steins added to the din.  He made his way\nbetween the close-packed tables to the stairs, and descended to the\nlower floor.  Here, if anything, the confusion was greater than\nabove; but here, too, was an exit through to the rear street–and a\nmoment later he was sauntering past the front of an unkempt little\npawnshop, closed for the night, over whose door, in the murk of a\ndistant street lamp, three balls hung in sagging disarray, tawny\nwith age, and across whose dirty, unwashed windows, letters missing,\nran the legend:",
        "     IS AC PELINA\n      Pawn brok r",
        "The pawnshop made the corner of a very dark and narrow lane–and,\nwith a quick glance around him to assure himself that he was\nunobserved, Jimmie Dale stepped into the alleyway, and, lost\ninstantly in the blacker shadows, stole along by the wall of the\npawnshop.  Old Isaac’s business was not all done through the front\ndoor.",
        "And then suddenly Jimmie Dale shrank still closer against the wall.\nWas it intuition, premonition–or reality?  There seemed an uncanny\nfeeling of PRESENCE around him, as though perhaps he were watched,\nas though others beside himself were in the lane.  Yes; ahead of him\na shadow moved–he could just barely distinguish it now that his\neyes had grown accustomed to the darkness.  It, like himself, was\nclose against the wall, and now it slunk noiselessly down the length\nof the lane until he lost sight of it.  AND WHAT WAS THAT?  He\nstrained his ears to listen.  It seemed like a window being opened\nor closed, cautiously, stealthily, the fraction of an inch at a\ntime.  And then he located the sound–it came from the other side of\nthe lane and very nearly opposite to where, on the second floor, a\ndull, yellow glow shone out from old Isaac’s private den in the rear\nof the pawnshop’s office.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s brows were gathered in sharp furrows.  There was\nevidently something afoot to-night of which the Tocsin had NOT\nsounded the alarm.  And then the frown relaxed, and he smiled a\nlittle.  Miraculous as was the means through which she obtained the\nknowledge that was the basis of their strange partnership, it was no\nmore miraculous than her unerring accuracy in the minutest details.\nThe Tocsin had never failed him yet.  It was possible that something\nwas afoot around him, quite probable, indeed, since he was in the\nmost vicious part of the city, in the heart of gangland; but\nwhatever it might be, it was certainly extraneous to his mission or\nshe would have mentioned it.",
        "The lane was empty now, he was quite sure of that–and there was no\nfurther sound from the window opposite.  He started forward once\nmore–only to halt again for the second time as abruptly as before,\nsqueezing if possible even more closely against the wall.  Some one\nhad turned into the lane from the sidewalk, and, walking hurriedly,\nchoosing with evident precaution the exact centre of the alleyway,\ncame toward him.",
        "The man passed, his hurried stride a half run; and, a few feet\nbeyond, halted at old Isaac’s side door.  From somewhere inside the\nold building Jimmie Dale’s ears caught the faint ringing of an\nelectric bell; a long ring, followed in quick succession by three\nshort ones–then the repeated clicking of a latch, as though pulled\nby a cord from above, and the man passed in through the door,\nclosing it behind him.",
        "Jimmie Dale nodded to himself in the darkness.  It was a spring\nlock; the signal was one long ring and three short ones–the Tocsin\nhad not missed even those small details.  Also, Burton was late for\nhis appointment, for that must have been Burton–business such as\nold Isaac had in hand that night would have permitted the entrance\nof no other visitor but K. Wilmington Maddon’s private secretary.",
        "He moved down the lane to the door, and tried it softly.  It was\nlocked, of course.  The slim, tapering, sensitive fingers, whose\ntips were eyes and ears to Jimmie Dale, felt over the lock–and a\nslender little steel instrument slipped into the keyhole.  A moment\nmore and the catch was released, and the door, under his hand, began\nto open.  With it ajar, he paused, his eyes searching intently up\nand down the lane.  There was nothing, no sign of any one, no\nmoving shadows now.  His gaze shifted to the window opposite.\nDirectly facing it now, with the dull reflection upon it from the\nlighted window of old Isaac’s den above his head, he could make out\nthat it was open–but that was all.",
        "Once more he smiled–a little tolerantly at himself this time.  Some\none had been in the lane; some one had opened the window of his or\nher room in that tenement house across from him–surely there was\nnothing surprising, unnatural, or even out of the commonplace in\nthat.  He had been a little bit on edge himself, perhaps, and the\nsudden movement of that shadow, unexpected, had startled him for the\nmoment, as, in all probability, the opening of the window had\nstartled the skulking figure itself into action.",
        "The door was open now.  He stepped noiselessly inside, and closed it\nnoiselessly behind him.  He was in a narrow hall, where a few yards\naway, a light shone down a stairway at right angles to the hall\nitself.",
        "“Rear door of pawnshop opens into hall, and exactly opposite very\nshort flight of stairs leading directly to doorway of Isaac’s den\nabove.  Ramshackle old place, low ceilings.  Isaac, when sitting in\nhis den, can look down, and, by means of a transom over the rear\ndoor of the shop, see the customers as they enter from the street,\nwhile he also keeps an eye on his assistant.  Latter always locks up\nand leaves promptly at six o’clock–”  Jimmie Dale was\nsubconsciously repeating to himself snatches from the Tocsin’s\nletter, which, as subconsciously in reading, he had memorised almost\nword for word.",
        "And now voices reached him–one, excited, nervous, as though the\nspeaker were labouring under mental strain that bordered closely on\nthe hysterical; the other, curiously mingling a querulousness with\nan attempt to pacify, but dominantly contemptuous, sneering, cold.",
        "Jimmie Dale moved along the hall–very slowly–without a sound–\ntesting each step before he threw his body weight from one leg to\nthe other.  He reached the foot of the stairs.  The Tocsin had been\nright; it was a very short flight.  He counted the steps–there were\neight.  Above, facing him, a door was open.  The voices were louder\nnow.  It was a sordid-looking room, what he could see of it,\npoverty-stricken in its appearance, intentionally so probably for\neffect, with no attempt whatever at furnishing.  He could see\nthrough the doorway to the window that opened on the alleyway, or,\nrather, just glimpse the top of the window at an angle across the\nroom–that and a bare stretch of floor.  The two men were not in the\nline of vision.",
        "Burton’s voice–it was unquestionably Burton speaking–came to\nJimmie Dale now distinctly.",
        "“No, I didn’t!  I tell you, I didn’t!  I–I hadn’t the nerve.”",
        "Jimmie Dale slipped his black silk mask over his face; and with\nextreme caution, on hands and knees, began to climb the stairs.",
        "“So!”  It was old Isaac now, in a half purr, half sneer.  “And I was\nso sure, my young friend, that you had.  I was so sure that you were\nnot such a fool.  Yes; I could even have sworn that they were in\nyour pocket now–what?  It is too bad–too bad!  It is not a\npleasant thing to think of, that little chair up the river in its\nhorrible little room where–”",
        "“For God’s sake, Isaac–not that!  Do you hear–not that!  My God, I\ndidn’t mean to–I didn’t know what I was doing!”",
        "Jimmie Dale crept up another step, another, and another.  There was\nsilence for a moment in the room; then Burton again, hoarse-voiced:",
        "“Isaac, I’ll make good to you some other way.  I swear I will–I\nswear it!  If I’m caught at this I’ll–I’ll get fifteen years for\nit.”",
        "“And which would you rather have?”  Jimmie Dale could picture the\noily smirk, the shrug of his shoulders, the outthrust hands, palms\nupward, elbows in at the hips, the fingers curved and wide apart–\n\"fifteen years, or what you get–for murder?  Eh, my friend, you\nhave thought of that–eh?  It is a very little price I ask–yes?”",
        "“Damn you!”  Burton’s voice was shrill, then dropped to a half sob.\n\"No, no, Isaac, I didn’t mean that.  Only, for God’s sake be\nmerciful!  It is not only the risk of the penitentiary; it’s more\nthan that.  I–I tried to play white all my life, and until that\ncursed night there’s no man living could say I haven’t.  You know\nthat–you know that, Isaac.  I tell you I couldn’t do it this\nafternoon–I tell you I couldn’t.  I tried to and–and I couldn’t.”",
        "Jimmie Dale was lying flat on the little landing now, peering into\nthe room.  Back a short distance from the doorway, a repulsive-\nlooking little man in unkempt clothes and soiled linen, with\nyellowish-skinned, parchment face, out of which small black eyes\nshone cunningly and shrewdly, sat at a bare deal table in a rickety\nchair; facing him across the table stood a young man of not more\nthan twenty-five, clean cut, well dressed, but whose face was\nunnaturally white now, and whose hand, as he extended it in a\npleading gesture toward the other, trembled visibly.  Jimmie Dale’s\nhand made its way quietly to his side pocket and extracted his\nautomatic.",
        "Old Isaac humped his shoulders, and leered at his visitor.",
        "“We talk a great deal, my young friend.  What is the use?  A bargain\nis a bargain.  A few rubies in exchange for your life.  A few rubies\nand my mouth is shut.  Otherwise\"–he humped his shoulders again.\n\"Well?”",
        "Burton drew back, swept his hand in a dazed way across his eyes–and\nlaughed out suddenly in bitter mirth.",
        "“A few rubies!” he cried.  “The most magnificent stones on this side\nof the water–a FEW rubies!  It’s been Maddon’s life hobby.  Every\nchild in New York knows that!  A few–yes, there’s only a few–but\nthose few are worth a fortune.  He trusts me, the man has been like\na father to me, and–”",
        "“So you are the very last to be suspected,” observed old Isaac\nsuavely.  “Have I not told you that?  There is nothing to fear.  Did\nwe not arrange everything so nicely–eh, my young friend?  See, it\nwas to-night that Maddon gives a little reception to his friends,\nand did you not say that the rubies would be taken from the safe-\ndeposit vault this afternoon since his friends always clamoured to\nsee them as a very fitting conclusion to an evening’s entertainment?\nAnd did you not say that you very naturally had access to the safe\nin the library where you worked, and that he would not notice they\nwere gone until he came to look for them some time this evening?  I\nthink you said all that.  And what suspicion let alone proof, would\nattach itself to you?  You were out of the room once when he, too,\nwas absent for perhaps half an hour.  It is very simple.  In that\nhalf hour, some one, somehow, abstracted them.  Certainly it was not\nyou.  You see how little I ask–and I pay well, do I not?  And so I\ngave you until to-night.  Three days have gone, and I have said\nnothing, and the body has not been found–eh?  But to-night–eh–it\nwas understood!  The rubies–or the chair.”",
        "Burton’s lips moved, but it was a moment before he could speak.",
        "“You wouldn’t dare!” he whispered thickly.  “You wouldn’t dare!  I’d\ntell the story of–of what you tried to make me do, and they’d send\nyou up for it.”",
        "Old Isaac shrugged with pitying contempt.",
        "“Is it, after all, a fool I am dealing with!” he sneered.  “And I–\nwhat should I say?  That you had stolen the stones from your\nemployer and offered them as a bribe to silence me, and that I had\nrefused.  The very act of handing you over to the police would prove\nthe truth of what I said and rob you of even a chance of leniency–\nFOR THAT OTHER THING.  Is it not so–eh?  And why did I not hand you\nover at once three nights ago?  Believe me, my young friend, I\nshould have a very good reason ready, a dozen, if necessary, if it\ncame to that.  But we are borrowing trouble, are we not?  We shall\nnot come to that–eh?”",
        "For a moment it seemed to Jimmie Dale, as he watched, that Burton\nwould hurl himself upon the other.  White to the lips, the muscles\nof his face twitching, Burton clenched his fists and leaned over the\ntable–and then, with sudden revulsion of emotion, he drew back once\nmore, and once more came that choked sob:",
        "“You’ll pay for this, Isaac–your turn will come for this!",
        "“I have been threatened very often,” snapped the other\ncontemptuously.  “Bah, what are threats!  I laugh at them–as I\nalways will.”  Then, with a quick change of front, his voice a\nsudden snarl: “Well, we have talked enough.  You have your choice.\nThe stones or–eh?  And it is to-night–NOW!”",
        "The old pawnbroker sprawled back in his chair, a cunning leer on his\nvicious face, a gleam of triumph, greed, in the beady, ratlike eyes\nthat never wavered from the other.  Burton, moisture oozing from his\nforehead, stood there, hesitant, staring back at old Isaac, half in\na fascinated gaze, half as though trying to read some sign of\nweakness in the bestial countenance that confronted him.  And then,\nvery slowly, in an automatic, machine-like way, his hand groped into\nthe inside pocket of his vest–and old Isaac cackled out in\nderision.",
        "“So!  You thought you could bluff me, eh–you thought you could fool\nold Isaac!  Bah! I read you like a book!  Did I not tell you a while\nback that you had them in your pocket?  I know your kind, my young\nfriend; I know your kind very well indeed–it is my business.  You\nwould not have dared to come here to-night without the price.  So!\nYou took them this afternoon as we agreed.  Yes, yes; you did well.\nYou will not regret it.  And now let me see them\"–his voice rose\neagerly–\"let me see them now, my young friend.”",
        "“Yes, I took them.” Burton spoke listlessly.  “God help me!”",
        "Old Isaac, quivering, excited, like a different creature now, sprang\nfrom his chair, and, as Burton drew a long, flat, leather case from\nhis pocket, snatched it from the other’s hand.  His fingers in their\nrapacious haste could not at first manipulate the catch, and then\nfinally, with the case open, he bent over the table feverishly.  The\nlight reflected back as from some living mass of crimson fire, now\nshading darkly, now glowing into wondrous, colourful transparency as\nhe moved the case to and fro with jerky motions of his hands–and he\nwas babbling, crooning to himself like one possessed.",
        "“Ah, the little beauties!  Ah, the pretty little things!  Yes, yes;\nthese are the ones!  This is the great Aracon–see, see, the six-\nsided prism terminated by the six-sided pyramid.  But it must be\ncut–it must be cut to sell it, eh?  Ah, it is too bad–too bad!\nAnd this, this one here, I know them all, this is–”",
        "But his sentence was never finished–it was Jimmie Dale, on his feet\nnow, leaning against the jamb of the door, his automatic covering\nthe two men at the table, who spoke.",
        "“Quite so, Isaac,” he said coolly; “you know them all!  Quite so,\nIsaac–but be good enough to DROP them!”",
        "The case fell from Isaac’s hand, the flush on his cheeks died to a\nsickly pallor, and, his mouth half open, he stood like a man turned\nto stone, his hands with curved fingers still outstretched over the\ntable, over the crimson gems that, spilled from the case, lay\nscattered now on the tabletop.  Burton neither spoke nor moved–a\nlittle whiter, the misery in his face almost apathetic, he moistened\nhis lips with the tip of his tongue.",
        "Jimmie Dale walked across the room, halted at the end of the table,\nand surveyed the two men grimly.  And then, while one hand with\nrevolver extended rested easily on the table, the other gathered up\nthe stones, placed them in the case, and, the case in his pocket,\nJimmie Dale’s lips parted in an uninviting smile.",
        "“I guess I’m in luck to-night, eh, Isaac?” he drawled.  “Between you\nand your young friend, as I believe you call him, it would appear as\nthough I had fallen on my feet.  That Aracon’s worth–what would you\nsay?–a hundred, two hundred thousand alone, eh?  A very famous\nstone, that–had your eye on it for quite a time, Isaac, you\nmiserable blood leech, eh?”",
        "Isaac did not answer; but, while he still held back from the table,\nhe seemed to be regaining a little of his composure–burglars of\nwhatever sort were no novelty to him–and was staring fixedly at\nJimmie Dale.",
        "“Can’t place me–though there’s not many in the profession you don’t\nknow?  Is that it?” inquired Jimmie Dale softly.  “Well, don’t try,\nIsaac; it’s hardly worth your while.  I’VE got the stones now, and–”",
        "“Wait!  Wait!  Listen!”  It was Burton, speaking for the first time,\nhis words coming in a quick, nervous rush.  “Listen!  You don’t–”",
        "“Hold your tongue!” cried old Isaac, with sudden fierceness.  “You\nare a fool!”  He leaned toward Jimmie Dale, a crafty smile on his\nface, quite in control of himself once more.  “Don’t listen to him–\nlisten to me.  You’re right.  I can’t place you, and it doesn’t make\nany difference\"–he took a step forward–\"but–”",
        "“Not too close, Isaac!” snapped Jimmie Dale sharply.  “I know YOU!”",
        "“So!” ejaculated old Isaac, rubbing his hands together.  “So!  That\nis good!  That is what I want.  Listen, we will make a bargain.  We\nare birds of a feather, eh?  All thieves, eh?  You’ve got the drop\non us who did all the work, but you’ll give us our share–eh?\nListen!  You couldn’t get rid of those stones alone.  You know that;\nyou’re not so green at the game, eh?  You’d have to go to some one.\nYou know me; you know old Isaac, you say.  Well, then, you know\nthere isn’t another man in New York could dispose of those rubies\nand play SAFE doing it except me.  I’ll make a good bargain with\nyou.”",
        "“Isaac,” said Jimmie Dale pensively, “you’ve made a good many ’good’\nbargains.  I wonder when you’ll make your last!  There’s more than\none looking for ’interest’ on those bargains in a pretty grim sort\nof way.”",
        "“Bah!” ejaculated old Isaac.  “It is an old story.  They are all\nalike.  I am afraid of none of them.  I hold them all like–THAT!\"\nHis hand opened and closed like a taloned claw.",
        "“And you’d add me to the lot, eh?” said Jimmie Dale.  He lifted the\nrevolver, its muzzle on old Isaac, examined the mechanism\nthoughfully, and lowered it again.  “Very well, I’ll make a bargain\nwith you–providing it is agreeable to your young friend here.”",
        "“Ah!” exclaimed old Isaac shrilly.  “So!  That is good!  It is done\nthen.”  He chuckled hoarsely.  “Any bargain I make he will agree to.\nIs it not so?”  He fixed his eyes on Burton.  “Well, is it not so?\nSpeak up!  Say–”",
        "He stopped–the words cut short off on his lips.  It came without\nwarning–a crash, a pound on the door below–another.",
        "Burton shrank back against the wall.",
        "“My God!  The police!” he gasped.  “Maddon’s found out!  We’re–\nwe’re caught!”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes, on old Isaac, narrowed.  The pounding in the\nalleyway grew louder, more insistent.  And then his first suspicion\npassed–it was no “game” of Isaac’s.  Crafty though the old fox was,\nthe other’s surprise and agitation was too genuine to be questioned.",
        "Still the pounding continued–some one was kicking viciously at the\ndoor, and banging a tattoo on the panels with his fists.",
        "Old Isaac’s clawlike hands doubled suddenly.",
        "“It is some drunken sot,” he snarled out, “that knows no better than\nto come here and rouse the whole neighbourhood!  It is true, in a\nmoment we will have the police running in from the street.  But\nwait–wait–I’ll teach the fool a lesson!”  He dashed around the\ntable, ran for the window, wrenched the catch up, flung the window\nopen, and, snarling again, leaned out–and instantly the knocking\nceased.",
        "And instantly then, with a sharp cry, as the whole ghastly meaning\nof it swept upon him, Jimmie sprang after the other–too late!  Came\nthe roar of a revolver shot, a stream of flame cutting the darkness\nof the alleyway from the window in the house opposite–and, without\na sound, old Isaac crumpled up, hung limply for a moment over the\nsill, and slid in a heap to the floor.",
        "On his hands and knees, protected from the possibility of another\nbullet by the height of the sill, Jimmie Dale, quick in every\nmovement now, dragged the inert form toward the table away from the\nwindow, and bent hurriedly over the other.  A minute perhaps he\nstayed there–and then rose slowly.",
        "Burton, horror-stricken, unmanned, beside himself, was hanging,\nclutching with both hands at the table edge.",
        "“He’s dead,” said Jimmie Dale laconically.",
        "Burton flung out his hands.",
        "“Dead!” he whispered hoarsely.  “I–I think I’m going mad.  Three\ndays of hell–and now this.  We’d–we’d better get out of here\nquick–they’ll get us if–”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s hand fell with a tight grip on Burton’s shoulder.",
        "“There won’t be any more shots fired–pull yourself together!”",
        "Burton stared at him in a demented way.",
        "“What’s–what’s it mean?” he stammered.",
        "“It means that I didn’t put two and two together,” said Jimmie Dale\na little bitterly.  “It means that there’s a dozen crooks been\ndancing old Isaac’s tune for a long time–and that some of them have\ngot him at last.”",
        "Burton reached out suddenly and clutched Jimmie Dale’s arm.",
        "“Then I’m safe!”  He mumbled the words, but there was dawning hope,\nrelief in his white face.  “Safe!  I’m safe–if you’ll only give me\nback those stones.  Give them back to me, for God’s sake give them\nback to me!  You don’t know–you don’t understand.  I stole them\nbecause–because he made me–because I–it was the only chance I\nhad.  Oh, my God, you don’t know what the last three days have been!\nGive them back to me, won’t you–won’t you?  You–you don’t know!”",
        "“Don’t lose your nerve!” said Jimmie Dale sharply.  “Sit down!”  He\npushed the other into the chair.  “There’s no one will disturb us\nhere for some time at least.  What is it that I don’t know?  That\nthree nights ago you were in a gambling hell, Sagosto’s, to be\nexact, one of the most disreputable in New York–and you went there\non the invitation of a stray acquaintance, a man named Perley–shall\nI describe him for you?  A short, slim-built man, black eyes, red\nhair, beard, and–”",
        "“YOU know that!”  The misery, the hopelessness was back in Burton’s\nface again–and suddenly he bent over the table and buried his head\nin his outflung arms.",
        "There was silence for a moment.  Tight-lipped, Jimmie Dale’s eyes\ntravelled from Burton’s shaking shoulders to the motionless form on\nthe floor.  Then he spoke again:",
        "“You’re a bit of a rounder, Burton, but I think you’ve had a lesson\nthat will last you all your life.  You were half-drunk when you and\nPerley began to hobnob over a downtown bar.  He said he’d show you\nsome real life, and you went with him to Sagosto’s.  He gave you a\nrevolver before you went in, and told you the place wasn’t safe for\nan unarmed man.  He introduced you to Sagosto, the proprietor, and\nyou were shown to a back room.  You drank quite a little there.  You\nand Perley were alone, throwing dice.  You got into a quarrel.\nPerley tried to draw his revolver.  You were quicker.  You drew the\none he had given you–and fired.  He fell to the floor–you saw the\nblood gush from his breast just above the heart–he was dead.  In a\npanic you rushed from the place and out into the street.  I don’t\nthink you went home that night.”",
        "Burton raised his head, showing his haggard face.",
        "“I guess it’s no use,” he said dully.”  If you know, others must.  I\nthought only Isaac and Sagosto knew.  Why haven’t I been arrested?\nI wish to God I had–I wouldn’t have had to-day to answer for.”",
        "“I am not through yet,” said Jimmie Dale gravely.  “The next day old\nIsaac here sent for you.  He said Sagosto had told him of the\nmurder, and had offered to dispose of the corpse and keep his mouth\nshut for fifty thousand dollars–that no one in his place knew of it\nexcept himself.  Isaac, for his share, wanted considerably more.\nYou told him you had no such sums, that you had no money.  He told\nyou how you could get it–you had access to Maddon’s safe, you were\nMaddon’s confidential secretary, fully in your employer’s trust, the\nlast man on earth to be suspected–and there were Maddon’s famous,\npriceless rubies.”",
        "Jimmie Dale paused.  Burton made no answer.",
        "“And so,” said Jimmie Dale presently, “to save yourself from the\ndeath penalty you took them.”",
        "“Yes,” said Burton, scarcely above his breath.  “Are you an officer?\nIf you are, take me, have done with it!  Only for Heaven’s sake end\nit!  If you’re not–”",
        "Jimmie Dale was not listening.  “The cupboard at the rear of the\nroom,” she had said.  He walked across to it now, opened it, and,\nafter a little search, found a small bundle.  He returned with it in\nhis hand, and, kneeling beside the dead man on the floor, his back\nto Burton, untied it, took out a red wig and beard, and slipped them\non to old Isaac’s head and face.",
        "“I wonder,” he said grimly, as he stood up, “if you ever saw this\nman before?”",
        "“My God–PERLEY!”  With a wild cry, Burton was on his feet,\nstraining forward like a man crazed.",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale, “Perley!  Sort of an ironic justice in his\nend as far as you are concerned, isn’t there?  I think we’ll leave\nhim like that–as Perley.  It will provide the police with an\ninteresting little problem–which they will never solve, and–\nSTEADY!”",
        "Burton was rocking on his feet, the tears were streaming down his\nface.  He lurched heavily–and Jimmie Dale caught him, and pushed\nhim back into the chair again.",
        "I thought–I thought there was blood on my hands,” said Burton\nbrokenly; “that–that I had taken a man’s life.  It was horrible,\nhorrible!  I’ve lived through three days that I thought would drive\nme mad, while I–I tried to do my work, and–and talk to people,\njust as if nothing had happened.  And every one that spoke to me\nseemed so carefree and happy, and I would have sold my soul to have\nchanged places with them.”  He stared at the form on the floor, and\nshivered suddenly.  “It–it was like that I saw him last!” he\nwhispered.  “But–but I do not understand.”",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled a little wearily.",
        "“It was simple enough,” he said.  “Old Isaac had had his eyes on\nthose rubies for a long time.  The easiest way of getting them was\nthrough you.  The revolver he gave you before you entered Sagosto’s\nwas loaded with blank cartridges, the blood you saw was the old, old\ntrick–a punctured bladder of red pigment concealed under the vest.”",
        "“Let us get out of here!”  Burton shuddered again.  “Let us get out\nof here–at once–now.  If we’re found here, we’ll be accused of–\nTHAT!”",
        "“There is no hurry,” Jimmie Dale answered quietly.  “I have told you\nthat no one is liable to come here to-night–and whoever did this\ncertainly will not raise an alarm.  And besides, there is still the\nmatter of the rubies–Burton.”",
        "“Yes,” said Burton, with a quick intake of his breath.",
        "“Yes–the rubies–what are you going to do with them?  I–I had\nforgotten them.  You’ll–”  He stopped, stared at Jimmie Dale, and\nburst into a miserable laugh.  “I’m a fool, a blind fool!” he\nmoaned.  “It does not matter what you do with them.  I forgot\nSagosto.  When they find Isaac here, Sagosto will either tell his\nstory, which will be enough to convict me of this night’s work, the\nREAL murder, even though I’m innocent; or else he’ll blackmail me\njust as Isaac did.”",
        "Jimmie Dale shook his head.",
        "“You are doing Isaac’s cunning an injustice,” he said grimly.\n\"Sagosto was only a tool, one of many that old Isaac had in his\npower–and, for that matter, as likely as any one else to have had a\nhand in Isaac’s murder to-night.  Sagosto saw you once when Isaac\nbrought you into his place–not because Isaac wanted Sagosto to see\nyou, but because he wanted YOU to see Sagosto.  Do you understand?\nIt would make the story that Sagosto came to him with the tale of\nthe murder the next day ring true.  Sagosto, however, did not go to\nold Isaac the next day to tell about any fake murder–naturally.\nSagosto would not know you again from Adam–neither does he know\nanything about the rubies, nor what old Isaac’s ulterior motives\nwere.  He was paid for his share in the game in old Isaac’s usual\nmanner of payment probably–by a threat of exposure for some old-\ntime offence, that Isaac held over him, if he didn’t keep his mouth\nshut.”",
        "Burton’s hand brushed his eyes.",
        "“Yes,” he muttered.  “Yes–I see it now.”",
        "Jimmie Dale stooped down, picked up the paper from the floor in\nwhich the wig and beard had been wrapped, walked back with it, and\nreplaced it in the cupboard.  And then, with his back to Burton\nagain, he took the case of gems from his pocket, opened it, and laid\nit on the cupboard shelf.  Also from his pocket came that thin metal\ncase, and from the case, with a pair of tweezers that obviated the\npossibility of telltale finger prints, a gray, diamond-shaped piece\nof paper, adhesive on one side that, cursed by the distracted\nauthorities in every police headquarters on both sides of the\nAtlantic, and raved at by a virulent press whose printed\nreproductions had made it familiar in every household in the land–\nwas the insignia of the Gray Seal.  He moistened the adhesive side,\ndropped it from the tweezers to his handkerchief, and pressed it\ndown firmly on the inside of the cover of the jewel case.  He put\nboth cases back in his pockets, and returned to Burton.",
        "“Burton,” he said a little sharply, “while I was outside that\ndoorway there, I heard you beg old Isaac to let you keep the rubies,\nand three times already you have asked the same of me.  What would\nyou do with them if I gave them back to you?”",
        "Burton did not reply for a moment–he was gazing at the masked face\nin a half-eager, half-doubtful way.",
        "“You–you mean you will give them back!” he burst out finally.",
        "“Answer my question,” prompted Jimmie Dale.",
        "“Do with them?” Burton repeated slowly.  “Why, I’ve told you.\nThey’d go back to Mr. Maddon–I’d take them back.”",
        "“Would you?” Jimmie Dale’s voice was quizzical.",
        "A puzzled expression came to Burton’s face.",
        "“I don’t know what you mean by that,” he said.  “Of course, I\nwould!”",
        "“How?” asked Jimmie Dale.  “Do you know the combination of Mr.\nMaddon’s safe?”",
        "“No,” said Burton",
        "“And the safe would be locked, wouldn’t it?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Quite so,” said Jimmie Dale musingly.  “Then, granted that Mr.\nMaddon has not already discovered the theft, how would you replace\nthe stones before he does discover it?  And if he already knows that\nthey are gone, how would you get them back into his hands?”",
        "“Yes, I know,” Burton answered a little listlessly.  “I’ve thought\nof that.  There’s only one way–to take them back to him myself, and\nmake a clean breast of it, and–”  He hesitated.",
        "“And tell him you stole them,” supplied Jimmie Dale.",
        "Burton nodded his head.  “Yes,” he said.",
        "“And then?” prodded Jimmie Dale.  What will Maddon do?  From what\nI’ve heard of him, he’s not a man to trifle with, nor a man to take\nan overly complacent view of things–not the man whose philosophy is\n’all’s well that ends well.’”",
        "“What does it matter?” Burton’s voice was low.  “It isn’t that so\nmuch.  I’m ready for that.  It’s the fact that he trusted me\nimplicitly, and I–well, I played the fool, or I’d never have got\ninto a mess like this.”",
        "For an instant Jimmie Dale looked at the other searchingly, and\nthen, smiling strangely, he shook his head.",
        "“There’s a better way than that, Burton,” he said quietly.",
        "“I think, as I said before, you’ve had a lesson to-night that will\nlast you all your life.  I’m going to give you another chance–with\nMaddon.  Here are the stones.”  He reached into his pocket and laid\nthe case on the table.",
        "But now Burton made no effort to take the case–his eyes, in that\npuzzled way again, were on Jimmie Dale.",
        "“A better way?” he repeated tensely.  “What do you mean?  What way?”",
        "“Well, say at the expense of another man’s reputation–of mine,\"\nsuggested Jimmie Dale, with his whimsical smile.  You need only say\nthat a man came to you this evening, told you that he stole these\nrubies from Mr. Maddon during the afternoon, and asked you, as Mr.\nMaddon’s private secretary, to restore them with his compliments to\ntheir owner.”",
        "A slow flush of disappointment, deepening to one of anger dyed\nBurton’s cheeks.",
        "“Are you trying to make a fool of me?” he cried out.  “Go to Maddon\nwith a childish tale like that!  There’s no man living would believe\nsuch a cock-and-bull story!”",
        "“No?” inquired Jimmie Dale softly.  “And yet I am inclined to think\nthere are a good many–that even Maddon would, hard-headed as he is.\nYou might say that when the man handed you the case you thought it\nwas some practical joke being foisted on you, until you opened the\ncase\"–Jimmie Dale pushed it a little farther across the table, and\nBurton, mechanically, his eyes still on Jimme Dale, loosened the\ncatch with his thumb nail–\"until you opened the case, saw the\nrubies, and–”",
        "“The Gray Seal!” Burton had snatched the case toward him, and was\nstraining his eyes at the inside cover.  “You–the Gray Seal!”",
        "“Well?” said Jimmie Dale whimsically.",
        "Motionless, the case held open in his hands, Burton stood there.",
        "“The Gray Seal!” he whispered.  Then, with a catch in his voice:\n\"You mean this?  You mean to let me have these back–you mean–you\nmean all you’ve said?  For God’s sake, don’t play with me–the Gray\nSeal, the most notorious criminal in the country, to give back a\nfortune like this!  You–you–”",
        "“Dog with a bad name,” said Jimmie Dale, with a wry smile; then, a\nlittle gruffly: “Put it in your pocket!”",
        "Slowly, almost as though he expected the case to be snatched back\nfrom him the next instant, Burton obeyed.",
        "I don’t understand–I CAN’T understand!” he murmured.  “They say\nthat you–and yet I believe you now–you’ve saved me from a ruined\nlife to-night.  The Gray Seal!  If–if every one knew what you had\ndone, they–”",
        "“But every one won’t,” Jimmie Dale broke in bluntly, “Who is to tell\nthem?  You?  You couldn’t very well, when you come to think of it–\ncould you?  Well, who knows, perhaps there have been others like\nyou!”",
        "“You mean,” said Burton excitedly, “you mean that all these crimes\nof yours that have seemed without motive, that have been so\ninexplicable, have really been like to-night to–”",
        "“I don’t mean anything at all,” interposed Jimmie Dale a little\nhurriedly.  “Nothing, Burton–except that there is still one little\nthing more to do to bolster up that ’childish’ story of mine–and\nthen get out of here.”  He glanced sharply, critically around the\nroom, his eyes resting for a moment at the last on the form on the\nfloor.  Then tersely: “I am going to turn out the light–we will have\nto pass the window to get to the door, and we will invite no\nchances.  Are you ready?”",
        "“No; not yet,” said Burton eagerly.  “I haven’t said what I’d like\nto say to you, what I–”",
        "“Walk straight to the door,” said Jimmie Dale curtly.  There was the\nclick of an electric-light switch, and the room was in darkness.\n\"Now, no noise!” he instructed.",
        "And Burton, perforce, made his way across the room–and at the door\nJimmie Dale joined him and led him down the short flight of stairs.\nAt the bottom, he opened the door leading into the rear of the\npawnshop itself, and, bidding Burton follow, entered.",
        "“We can’t risk even a match; it could be seen from the street,” he\nsaid brusquely, as he fumbled around for a moment in the darkness.\n\"Ah–here it is!”  He lifted a telephone receiver from its hook, and\ngave a number.",
        "Burton caught him quickly by the arm.",
        "“Good Lord, man, what are you doing?” he protested anxiously.\n\"That’s Mr. Maddon’s house!”",
        "“So I believe,” said Jimmie Dale complacently.  “Hello!  Is Mr.\nMaddon there? . . .  I beg pardon? . . .  Personally, yes, if you\nplease.”",
        "There was a moment’s wait.  Burton’s hand was still nervously\nclutching at Jimmie Dale’s sleeve.  Then:",
        "“Mr. Maddon?” asked Jimmie Dale pleasantly.  “Yes? . . .  I am very\nsorry to trouble you, but I called you up to inquire if you were\naware that your rubies, and among them your Aracon, had been stolen?\n. . .  I beg pardon! . . .  Rubies–yes. . . .  You weren’t. . . .\nOh, no, I am quite in my right mind; if you will take the trouble to\nopen your safe you will find they are gone–shall I hold the line\nwhile you investigate? . . .  What? . . .  Don’t shout, please–and\nstand a little farther away from the mouthpiece.”  Jimmie Dale’s\ntone was one of insolent composure now.  “There is really no use in\ngetting excited. . . .  I beg pardon? . . .  Certainly, this is the\nGray Seal speaking. . . .  What?”  Jimmie Dale’s voice grew\nplaintive, “I really can’t make out a word when you yell like that.\n. . .  Yes. . . .  I had occasion to use them this afternoon, and I\ntook the liberty of borrowing them temporarily–are you still there,\nMr. Maddon? . . .  Oh, quite so!  Yes, I hear you NOW. . . .  No,\nthat is all, only I am returning them through your private\nsecretary, a very estimable young man, though I fear somewhat\nexcitable and shaky, who is on his way to you with them now. . . .\nWHAT’S THAT YOU SAY?  You repeat that,” snapped Jimmie Dale\nsuddenly, icily, “and I’ll take them from under your nose again\nbefore morning! . . .  Ah!  That is better!  Good-night–Mr.\nMaddon.”",
        "Jimmie Dale hung up the receiver and shoved Burton toward the door.",
        "“Now then, Burton, we’ll get out of her–and the sooner you reach\nFifth Avenue and Mr. Maddon’s house the better.  No; not that way!\"\nThey had reached the hall, and Burton had turned toward the side\ndoor that opened on the alleyway.  “Whoever they were who settled\ntheir last account with Isaac may still be watching.  They’ve\nnothing against any one else, but they know some one was in here at\nthe time, and, if the police are clever enough ever to get on their\ntrack, they might find it very convenient to be able to say WHO was\nin the room when Isaac was murdered–there’s nothing to show, since\nIsaac so obligingly opened the window for them, that the shot was\nfired THROUGH the window and not from the inside of the room.  And\neven if they have already taken to their heels\"–Jimmie Dale was\nleading Burton up the stairs again as he talked–\"it might prove\nexceedingly inconvenient for us if some passer-by should happen to\nrecollect that he saw two men of our general appearance leaving the\npremises.  Now keep close–and follow me.”",
        "They passed the door of Isaac’s den, turned down a narrow corridor\nthat led to the rear of the house–Jimmie Dale guiding unerringly,\nworking from the mental map of the house that the Tocsin had drawn\nfor him–descended another short flight of stairs that gave on the\nkitchen, crossed the kitchen, and Jimmie Dale opened a back door.\nHe paused here for a moment to listen; then, cautioning Burton to be\nsilent, moved on again across a small back yard and through a gate\ninto a lane that ran at right angles to the alleyway by which both\nhad entered the house–and, a minute later, they were crouched\nagainst a building, a half block away, where the lane intersected\nthe cross street.",
        "Here Jimmie Dale peered out cautiously.  There was no one in sight.\nHe touched Burton’s shoulder, and pointed down the street.",
        "“That’s your way, Burton–mine’s the other.  Hurry while you’ve got\nthe chance.  Good-night.”",
        "Burton’s hand reached out, caught Jimmie Dale’s, and wrung it.",
        "“God bless you!” he said huskily.  “I–”",
        "And Jimmie Dale pushed him out on to the street.",
        "Burton’s steps receded down the sidewalk.  Jimmie Dale still\ncrouched against the wall.  The steps grew fainter in the distance\nand died finally away.  Jimmie Dale straightened up, slipped the\nmask from his face to his pocket, stepped out on the street–and\nfive minutes later was passing through the noisy bedlam of the\nHungarian restaurant on his way to the front door and his car.",
        "“SONNEZ LE TOCSIN,” Jimmie Dale was saying softly to himself.  “I\nwonder what she’ll do when she finds I’ve got the ring?”",
        "The Tocsin!  By neither act, sign, nor word had she evidenced the\nslightest interest in that ring–and yet she must know, she\ncertainly must know that it was now in his possession.  Jimmie Dale\nwas disappointed.  Somehow, he had counted more than he had cared to\nadmit on developments from that ring.",
        "He pulled a little viciously at his cigarette, as he stared out of\nthe St. James Club window.  That was how long ago?  Ten days?  Yes;\nthis would be the eleventh.  Eleven days now and no word from her–\neleven days since that night at old Isaac’s, since she had last\ncalled him, the Gray Seal, to arms.  It was a long while–so long a\nwhile even that what had come to be his prerogative in the\nnewspapers, the front page with three-inch type recounting some new\nexploit of that mysterious criminal the Gray Seal, was being\nusurped.  The papers were howling now about what they, for the lack\nof a better term, were pleased to call a wave of crime that had\ninundated New York, and of which, for once, the Gray Seal was not\nthe storm centre, but rather, for the moment, forgotten.",
        "He drew back from the window, and, settling himself again in the big\nleather lounging chair, resumed the perusal of the evening paper.\nHis eye fell on what was common to every edition now, a crime\neditorial–and the paper crackled suddenly under the long, slim,\ntapering fingers, so carefully nurtured, whose sensitive tips a\nhundred times had made mockery of the human ingenuity squandered on\nthe intricate mechanism of safes and vaults.  No; he was wrong–the\nGray Seal had not been forgotten.",
        "“We should not be surprised,” wrote the editor virulently, “to\ndiscover at the bottom of these abominable attrocities that the\nguiding spirit, in fact, was the Gray Seal–they are quite worthy\neven of his diabolical disregard for the laws of God and man.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s lips straightened ominously, and an angry glint crept\ninto his dark, steady eyes.  There was nothing then, nothing too\nvile that, in the public’s eyes, could not logically be associated\nwith the Gray Seal–even this!  A series of the most cold-blooded,\ncallous murders and robberies, the work, on the face of it, of a\nwell-organized band of thugs, brutal, insensate, little better than\nfiends, though clever enough so far to have evaded capture, clever\nenough, indeed, to have kept the police still staggering and gasping\nafter a clew for one murder–while another was in the very act of\nbeing committed!  The Gray Seal!  What exquisite irony!  And yet,\nafter all, the papers were not wholly to blame for what they said;\nhe had invited much of it.  Seeming crimes of the Gray Seal had\napparently been genuine beyond any question of doubt, as he had\nintended them to appear, as in the very essence of their purpose\nthey had to be.",
        "“Yes; he had invited much–he and she together–the Tocsin and\nhimself.  He, Jimmie Dale, millionaire, clubman, whose name for\ngenerations in New York had been the family pride, was “wanted” as\nthe Gray Seal for so many “crimes” that he had lost track of them\nhimself–but from any one of which, let the identity of the Gray\nSeal be once solved, there was and could be no escape!  What\nexquisite irony–yet full, too, of the most deadly consequences!",
        "Once more Jimmie Dale’s eyes sought the paper, and this time scanned\nthe headlines of the first page:",
        "Brutal Murder of Mill Paymaster.",
        "THE CRIME WAVE STILL AT ITS HEIGHT.",
        "HERMAN ROESSLE FOUND DEAD NEAR HIS CAR.",
        "ASSASSINS ESCAPE WITH $20,000.",
        "Jimmie Dale read on–and as he read there came again that angry set\nto his lips.  The details were not pleasant.  Herman Roessle, the\npaymaster of the Martindale-Kensington Mills, whose plant was on the\nHudson, had gone that morning in his runabout to the nearest town,\nthree miles away, for the monthly pay roll; had secured the money\nfrom the bank, a sum of twenty-odd thousand dollars; and had started\nback with it for the mill.  At first, it being broad daylight and a\nwell-frequented road, his nonappearance caused no apprehension; but\nas early afternoon came and there was still no sign of Roessle the\nmill management took alarm.  Discovering that he had left the bank\nfor the return journey at a few minutes before eleven, and that\nnothing had been seen of him at his home, the police were notified.\nFollowed then several hours of fruitless search, until finally, with\nthe whole countryside aroused and the efforts of the police\naugumented by private search parties, the car was found in a thicket\nat the edge of a crossroad some four miles back from the river, and,\na little way from the car, the body of Roessle, dead, the man’s head\ncrushed in where it had been fiendishly battered by some blunt,\nheavy object.  There was no clew–no one could be found who had seen\nthe car on the crossroad–the murderer, or murderers, and the\ntwenty-odd thousand dollars in cash had disappeared leaving no trace\nbehind.",
        "There were several columns of this, which Jimmie Dale skimmed\nthrough quickly; but at the end he stared for a long time at the\nlast paragraph.  Somehow, strange, to relate, the paper had\nneglected to turn its “sob” artist loose, and the few words, added\nalmost as though they were an afterthought, for once rang true and\nfull of pathos in their very simplicity–at the Roessle home, where\nMrs. Roessle was prostrated, two little tots of five and seven, too\nyoung to understand, had gravely received the reporter and told him\nthat some bad man had hurt their daddy.",
        "“Mr. Dale, sir!”",
        "Jimmie Dale lowered his paper.  A club attendant was standing before\nhim, respectfully extending a silver card tray.  From the man,\nJimmie Dale’s eyes fixed on a white envelope on the tray.  One\nglance was enough–it was HERS, that letter.  The Tocsin again!  His\nbrain seemed suddenly to be afire, and he could feel his pulse\nquicken, the blood begin to pound in fierce throbs at his heart.\nLife and death lay in that white, innocent-looking, unaddressed\nenvelope, danger, peril–it was always life and death, for those\nwere the stakes for which the Tocsin played.  But, master of many\nthings, Jimmie Dale was most of all master of himself.  Not a muscle\nof his face moved.  He reached nonchalantly for the letter.",
        "“Thank you,” said Jimmie Dale.",
        "The man bowed and started away.  Jimmie Dale laid the envelope on\nthe arm of the lounging chair.  The man had reached the door when\nJimmie Dale stopped him.",
        "“Oh, by the way,” said Jimmie Dale languidly, “where did this come\nfrom?”",
        "“Your chauffeur, sir,” replied the other.  “Your chauffeur gave it\nto the hall porter a moment ago, sir.”",
        "“Thank you,” said Jimmie Dale again.",
        "The door closed.",
        "Jimmie Dale glanced around the room.  It was the caution of habit,\nthat glance; the habit of years in which his life had hung on little\nthings.  He was alone in one of the club’s private library rooms.\nHe picked up the envelope, tore it open, took out the folded sheets\ninside, and began to read.  At the first words he leaned forward,\nsuddenly tense in his chair.  He read on, turning the pages\nhurriedly, incredulity, amazement, and, finally, a strange menace\nmirroring itself in turn upon his face.",
        "He stood up–the letter in his hand.",
        "“My God!” whispered Jimmie Dale.",
        "It was a call to arms such as the Gray Seal had never received\nbefore–such as the Tocsin had never made before.  And if it were\ntrue it–  True!  He laughed aloud a little gratingly.  True!  Had\nthe Tocsin, astounding, unbelievable, mystifying as were the means\nby which she acquired her knowledge not only of this, but of\ncountless other affairs, ever by so much as the smallest detail been\nastray.  If it were true!",
        "He pulled out his watch.  It was half-past nine.  Benson, his\nchauffeur, had sent the letter into the club.  Benson had been\nwaiting outside there ever since dinner.  Jimmie Dale, for the first\ntime since the first communication that he had ever received from\nthe Tocsin, did not immediately destroy her letter now.  He slipped\nit into his pocket–and stepped quickly from the room.",
        "In the cloakroom downstairs he secured his hat and overcoat, and,\nthough it was a warm evening, put on the latter since he was in\nevening clothes, then walked leisurely out of the club.",
        "At the curb, Benson, the chauffeur, sprang from his seat, and,\ntouching his cap, opened the door of a luxurious limousine.",
        "Jimmie Dale shook his head.",
        "“I shall not keep you waiting any longer, Benson,” he said.  “You\nmay take the car home, and put it up.  I shall probably be late to-\nnight.”",
        "“Very good, sir,” replied the chauffeur.",
        "“You sent in a letter a moment or so ago, Benson?” observed Jimmie\nDale casually, opening his cigarette case.",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Benson.  “I hope I didn’t do wrong, sir.  He said\nit was important, and that you were to have it at once.”",
        "“He?”  Jimmie Dale was lighting his cigarette now.",
        "“A boy, sir,” Benson amplified.  “I couldn’t get anything out of\nhim.  He just said he’d been told to give it to me, and tell me to\nsee that you got it at once.  I hope, sir, I haven’t–”",
        "“Not at all, Benson,” said Jimmie Dale pleasantly.  “It’s quite all\nright.  Good-night, Benson.”",
        "“Good-night, sir,” Benson answered, climbing back to his seat.",
        "There was a queer little smile on Jimmie Dale’s lips, as he watched\nthe great car swing around in the street and glide noiselessly away–\na queer little smile that still held there even after he himself\nhad started briskly along the avenue in a downtown direction.  It\nwas invariably the same, always the same–the letters came\nunexpectedly, when least looked for, now by this means, now by that,\nbut always in a manner that precluded the slightest possibility of\ntracing them to their source.  Was there anything, in his intimate\nsurroundings, in his intimate life, that she did not know about him–\nwho knew absolutely nothing about her!  Benson, for instance–that\nthe man was absolutely trustworthy–or else she would never for an\ninstant have risked the letter in his possession.  Was there\nanything that she did not–yes, one thing–she did not know him in\nthe role he was going to play to-night.  That at least was one thing\nthat surely she did not know about him; the role in which, many\ntimes, for weeks on end, he had devoted himself body and soul in an\nattempt to solve the mystery with which she surrounded herself; the\nrole, too, that often enough had been a bulwark of safety to him\nwhen hard pressed by the police; the role out of which he had so\ncarefully, so painstakingly created a now recognised and well-known\ncharacter of the underworld–the role of Larry the Bat.",
        "Jimmie Dale turned from Fifth Avenue into Broadway, continued on\ndown Broadway, across to the Bowery, kept along the Bowery for\nseveral more blocka–and finally headed east into the dimly lighted\ncross street on which the Sanctuary was located.",
        "And now Jimmie Dale became cautious in his movements.  As he\napproached the black alleyway that flanked the miserable tenement,\nhe glanced sharply behind and about him; and, at the alleyway\nitself, without pause, but with a curious lightning-like side step,\nno longer Jimmie Dale now, but the Gray Seal, he disappeared from\nthe street, and was lost in the deep shadows of the building.",
        "In a moment he was at the side door, listening for any sound from\nwithin–none had ever seen or met the lodger or the first floor\neither ascending or descending, except in the familiar character of\nLarry the Bat.  He opened the door, closed it behind him, and in the\nutter blackness went noiselessly up the stairs–stairs so rickety\nthat it seemed a mouse’s tread alone would have set them creaking.\nThere seemed an art in the play of Jimmie Dale’s every muscle; in\nthe movements, lithe, balanced, quick, absolutely silent.  On the\nfirst landing he stopped before another door, there was the faint\nclick of a key turning in the lock; and then this door, too, closed\nbehind him.  Sounded the faint click of the key as it turned again,\nand Jimmie Dale drew a long breath, stepped across the room to\nassure himself that the window blind was down, and lighted the gas\njet.",
        "A yellow, murky flame spurted up, pitifully weak, almost as though\nit were ashamed of its disreputable surroundings.  Dirt, disorder,\nsqualour, the evidence of low living testified eloquently enough to\nany one, the police, for instance, in times past inquisitive until\nthey were fatuously content with the belief that they knew the\noccupant for what he was, that the place was quite in keeping with\nits tenant, a mute prototype, as it were, of Larry the Bat, the dope\nfiend.",
        "For a little space, Jimmie Dale, immaculate in his evening clothes,\nstood in the centre of the miserable room, his dark eyes, keen,\nalert, critical, sweeping comprehensively over every object about\nhim–the position of a chair, of a cracked drinking glass on the\nbroken-legged table, of an old coat thrown with apparent\ncarelessness on the floor at the foot of the bed, of a broken bottle\nthat had innocently strewn some sort of white powder close to the\nthreshold, inviting unwary foot tracks across the floor.  And then,\ntaking out the Tocsin’s letter, he laid it upon the table, placed\nwhat money he had in his pockets beside it, and began rapidly to\nremove his clothes.  The Sanctuary had not been invaded since his\nlast visit there.",
        "He turned back the oilcloth in the far corner of the room, took up\nthe piece of loose flooring, which, however, strangely enough,\nfitted so closely as to give no sign of its existence even should it\ninadvertently, by some curious visitor again be trod upon; and from\nthe aperture beneath lifted out a bundle of clothes and a small box.",
        "Undressed now, he carefully folded the clothes he had taken off,\nlaid them under the flooring, and began to dress again, his wardrobe\nsupplied by the bundle he had taken out in exchange–an old pair of\nshoes, the laces broken; mismated socks; patched trousers, frayed at\nthe bottoms; a soiled shirt, collarless, open at the neck.  Attired\nto his satisfaction, he placed the box upon the table, propped up a\ncracked mirror, sat down in front of it, and, with a deft, artist’s\ntouch, began to apply stain to his hands, wrists, neck, throat, and\nface–but the hardness, the grim menace that now grew into the\ndominant characteristic of his features was not due to the stain\nalone.",
        "“Dear Philanthropic Crook\"–his eyes were on the Tocsin’s letter\nthat lay before him.  He read on–for once, even to Jimmie Dale’s\nkeen, facile mind, a first reading had failed to convey the full\nsignificance of what she had written.  It was too amazing, almost\nbeyond belief–the series of crimes, rampant for the past few weeks,\nat which the community had stood aghast, the brutal murder of\nRoessle but a few hours old, lay bare before his eyes.  It was all\nthere, all of it, the details, the hellish cleverness, the personnel\neven of the thugs, all, everything–except the proof.",
        "“Get him, Jimmie–the man higher up.  Get him, Jimmie–before\nanother pays forfeit with his life\"–the words seemed to leap out at\nhim from the white page in red, dancing lines–\"Get him–Jimmie–the\nman higher up.”",
        "Jimmie Dale finished the second reading of the letter, read it again\nfor the third time, then tore it into tiny fragments.  His fingers\ndelved into the box again, and the transformation of Jimmie Dale,\nmember of New York’s most exclusive social set, into a low, vicious-\nfeatured denizen of the underworld went on–a little wax applied\nskilfully behind the ears, in the nostrils and under the upper lip.",
        "It was all there–all except the proof.  And the proof–he laughed\naloud suddenly, unpleasantly.  There seemed something sardonic in\nit; ay, more than that, all that was grim in irony.  The proof, in\nStangeist’s own writing, sworn to before witnesses in the presence\nof a notary, the text of the document, of course, unknown to both\nwitnesses and notary, evidence, absolute and final, that would be\nadmitted in any court, for Stangeist was a lawyer, and would see to\nthat, was in Stangeist’s own safe, for Stangeist’s own protection–\nStangeist, who was himself the head and brains of this murder gang–\nStangeist, who was the man higher up!",
        "It was amazing, without parallel in the history of crime–and yet\ningenious, clever, full of the craft and cunning that had built up\nthe shyster lawyer’s reputation below the dead line.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s lips were curiously thin now.  So it was Stangeist!  A\nDoctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with a vengeance!  He knew Stangeist–not\npersonally; not by the reputation Stangeist held, low even as that\nwas, among his brother members of the profession; but as the man was\nknown for what he really was among the crooks and criminals of the\nunderworld, where, in that strange underground exchange, whispered\nconfidences passed between those whose common enemy was the law,\nwhere Larry the Bat himself was trusted in the innermost circles.",
        "Stangeist was a power in the Bad Lands.  There were few among that\nunholy community that Stangeist, at one time or another, in one way\nor another, had not rescued from the clutches of the law, resorting\nto any trick or cunning, but with perjury, that he could handle like\nthe master of it that he was, employed as the most common weapon of\ndefence for his clients–provided he were paid well enough for it.\nThe man had become more than the attorney for the crime world–he\nhad become part of it.  Cunning, shrewd, crafty, conscienceless,\ncold-blooded–that was Stangeist.",
        "The form and features of the man pictured themselves in Jimmie\nDale’s mind–the six-foot muscular frame, that was invariably\nclothed in attire of the most fashionable cut; the thin lips with\ntheir oily, plausible smile, the straight black hair that straggled\ninto pin point, little black eyes, the dark face with its high cheek\nbones, which, with the pronounced aquiline nose and the persistent\nrumour that he was a quarter caste, had led the underworld,\nprejudiced always in favour of a “monaker,” to dub the man the\n\"Indian Chief.”",
        "Jimmie Dale laughed again–still unpleasantly.  So Stangeist had\ntaken the plunge at last and branched out into a wider field, had\nhe?  Well, there was nothing surprising in that–except that he had\nnot done it before!  The irony of it lay in the fact that at last he\nhad been TOO clever, overstepped himself in his own cleverness, that\nwas all.  It was Australian Ike, The Mope, and Clarie Deane that\nStangeist had gathered around him, the Tocsin had said–and there\nwere none worse in Larry the Bat’s wide range of acquaintanceship\nthan those three.  Stangeist had made himself master of Australian\nIke, The Mope, and Clarie Deane–and he had driven them a little too\nhard on the division of the spoils–and laughed at them, and cracked\nthe whip much after the fashion that the trainer in the cage handles\nthe growling beasts around him.",
        "A dozen of the crimes that had appalled and staggered New York they\nhad committed under his leadership; and then, it seemed, they had\nquarrelled furiously, the three pitted against Stangeist,\nthreatening him, demanding a more equitable share of the proceeds.\nNone was better aware than Stangeist that threats from men of their\ncalibre were likely to result in a grim aftermath–and Stangeist,\nyesterday, the Tocsin said, had answered them as no other man than\nStangeist would either have thought of or have dared to do.  One by\none, at separate times, covering the other with a revolver,\nStangeist had permitted them to read a document that was addressed\nto the district attorney.  It was a confession, complete in every\ndetail, of every crime the four together had committed, implicating\nStangeist as fully and unreservedly as it did the other three.  It\nrequired no commentary!  If anything happened to Stangeist, a stab\nin the dark, for instance, a bullet from some dark alleyway, a\nblackjack deftly wielded, as only Australian Ike, The Mope or Clarie\nDeane knew how to wield it–the document automatically became a\nDEATH SENTENCE for Australian Ike, The Mope, and Clarie Deane!",
        "It was very simple–and, evidently, it had been effective, as\nwitness the renewal of their operations in the murder of Roessle\nthat afternoon.  Fear and avarice had both probably played their\npart; fear of the man who would with such consummate nerve fling his\nlife into the balance to turn the tables upon them, while he jeered\nat them; avarice that prompted them to get what they could out of\nStangeist’s brains and leadership, and to be satisfied with what\nthey COULD get–since they could get no more!",
        "Satisfied?  Jimmie Dale shook his head.  No; that was hardly the\nword–cowed, perhaps, for the moment, would be better.  But\nafterward, with a document like that in existence, when they would\nnever be safe for an instant–well, beasts in the cages had been\nknown to get the better of the man with the whip, and beasts were\ngentle things compared with Australian Ike, The Mope, and Clarie\nDeane!  Some day they would reverse the tables on the Indian Chief–\nif they could.  And if they couldn’t it would not be for the lack of\ntrying.",
        "There would be another act in that drama of the House Divided before\nthe curtain fell!  And there would be a sort of grim, poetic justice\nin it, a temptation almost to let the play work itself out to its\nown inevitable conclusion, only–Jimmie Dale, the final touches\ngiven to his features, stood up, and his hands clenched suddenly,\nfiercely–it was not just the man higher up alone, there were the\nother three as well, the whole four of them, all of them, crimes\nwithout number at their door, brutal, fiendish acts, damnable\noutrages, murder to answer for, with which the public now was\nbeginning to connect the name of the Gray Seal!  The Gray Seal!",
        "Jimmie Dale’s hands, whose delicate fingers were artfully grimed and\nblackened now beneath the nails, clenched still tighter–and then,\nwith a quick shrug of his shoulders, a thinning of the firmly\ncompressed lips, he picked up the coat from where it lay upon the\nfloor, put it on, put the money that was on the table in his pocket,\nand replaced the box under the flooring.",
        "In quick succession, from the same hiding place, an automatic, a\nblack silk mask, an electric flashlight, that thin metal box like a\ncigarette case, and a half dozen vicious-looking little blued-steel\nburglar’s tools were stowed away in his pockets, the flooring\ncarefully replaced, the oilcloth spread back again; and then,\npulling a slouch hat well down over his eyes, he reached up to turn\noff the gas.",
        "For an instant his hand held there, while his eyes, sweeping around\nthe apartment, took in every single detail about him in that same\nalert, comprehensive way as when he had entered–then the room was\nin darkness, and the Gray Seal, as Larry the Bat, a shuffling,\nunkempt creature of the underworld, alias Jimmie Dale, the lionised\nof clubs, the matrimonial target of exclusive drawing-rooms, closed\nthe door of the Sanctuary behind him, shuffled down the stairs,\nshuffled out into the lane, and shuffled along the street toward the\nBowery.",
        "A policeman on the corner accosted him familiarly.",
        "“Hello, Larry!” grinned the officer.",
        "“’Ello!” returned Jimmie Dale affably through the side of his mouth.\n\"Fine night, ain’t it?\"–and shuffled on along the street.",
        "And now Jimmie Dale began to hurry–still with that shuffling tread,\nbut covering the ground nevertheless with amazing celerity.  He had\nlost no time since receiving the Tocsin’s letter, it was true, but,\nfor all that, it was now after ten o’clock.  Stangeist’s house was\n\"dark” that evening, she had said, meaning that the occupants,\nStangeist as well as whatever servants there might be, for Stangeist\nhad no family, were out–the servants in town for a theatre or\npicture show probably–and Stangeist himself as yet not back,\npresumably from that Roessle affair.  The stub of an old cigar,\nunlighted, shifted with a sudden, savage twist of the lips from one\nside of Jimmie Dale’s mouth to the other.  There was need for haste.\nThere was no telling when Stangeist might get back–as for the\nservants, that did not matter so much; servants in suburban homes\nhad a marked affinity for “last trains!”",
        "Jimmie Dale boarded a cross-town car, effected a transfer, and in a\nquarter of an hour after leaving the Sanctuary was huddled, an\ninoffensive heap, like a tired-out workingman, in a corner seat of a\nLong Island train.  From here, there was only a short run ahead of\nhim, and, twenty minutes later, descending from the train at Forest\nHills, he had passed through the more thickly settled portion of the\nlittle place, and was walking briskly out along the country road.",
        "Stangeist’s house lay, approximately, a mile and a half from the\nstation, quite by itself, and set well back from the road.  Jimmie\nDale could have found it with his eyes blindfolded–the Tocsin’s\ndirections had lacked none of their usual explicit minuteness.  The\nroad was quite deserted.  Jimmie Dale met no one.  Even in the\nhouses that he passed the lights were in nearly every instance\nalready out.",
        "Something, merciless in its rage, swept suddenly over Jimmie Dale,\nas, unbidden, of its own volition, the last paragraph he had read in\nthat evening’s paper began to repeat itself over and over again in\nhis mind.  The two little kiddies–it seemed as though he could see\nthem standing there–and from Jimmie Dale’s lips, not given to\nprofanity, there came a bitter oath.  It might possibly be that,\neven if he were successful in what was before him to-night, the\nauthors of the Roessle murder would never be known.  That confession\nof Stangeist’s was written prior to what had happened that\nafternoon, and there would be no mention, naturally, of Roessle.\nAnd, for a moment, that seemed to Jimmie Dale the one thing\nparamount to all others, the one thing that was vital; then he shook\nhis head, and laughed out shortly.  After all, it did not matter–\nwhether Stangeist and the blood wolves he had gathered around him\npaid the penalty specifically for one particular crime or for\nanother could make little difference–they would PAY, just as\nsurely, just as certainly, once that paper was in his possession!",
        "Jimmie Dale was counting the houses as he passed–they were more\ninfrequent now, farther apart.  Stangeist was no fool–not the fool\nthat he would appear to be for keeping a document like that, once he\nhad had the temerity to execute it, in his own safe; for, in a day\nor two, the Tocsin had hinted at this, after holding it over the\nheads of Australian Ike, The Mope, and Clarie Deane again to drive\nthe force of it a little deeper home, he would undoubtedly destroy\nit–and the SUPPOSITION that it was still in existence would have\nequally the same effect on the minds of the other three!  Stangeist\nwas certainly alive to the peril that he ran with such a thing in\nhis possession, only the peril had not appealed to him as imminent\neither from the three thugs with whom he had allied himself, or,\nmuch less, from any one else, that was all.",
        "Jimmie Dale halted by a low, ornamental stone fence, some three feet\nhigh, and stood there for a moment, glancing about him.  This was\nStangeist’s house–he could just make out the building as it loomed\nup a shadowy, irregular shape, perhaps two hundred yards back from\nthe fence.  The house was quite dark, not a light showed in any\nwindow.  Jimmie Dale sat down casually on the fence, looked\ncarefully again up and down the road–then, swinging his legs over,\nquick now in every action, he dropped to the other side, and stole\nsilently across the grass to the rear of the house.",
        "Here he stopped again, reached up to a window that was about on a\nlevel with his shoulders, and tested its fastenings.  The window–it\nwas the window of Stangeist’s private sanctum, according to the plan\nin her letter–was securely locked.  Jimmie Dale’s hands went into\nhis pocket–and the black silk mask was slipped over his face.  He\nlistened intently–then a little steel instrument began to gnaw like\na rat.",
        "A minute passed–two of them.  Again Jimmie Dale listened.  There\nwas not a sound save the night sounds–the light breeze whispering\nthrough the branches of the trees; the far-off rumble of a train;\nthe whir of insects; the hoarse croaking of a frog from some near-by\ncreek or pond.  The window sash was raised an inch, another, and\ngradually to the top.  Like a shadow, Jimmie Dale pulled himself up\nto the sill, and, poised there, his hand parted the heavy portieres\nthat hung within.  It was too dark to distinguish even a single\nobject in the room.  He lowered himself to the floor, and slipped\ncautiously between the portieres.",
        "From somewhere in the house, a clock began to strike.  Jimmie Dale\ncounted the strokes.  Eleven o’clock.  It was getting late–TOO\nlate!  Stangeist was likely to be back at any moment.  The\nflashlight, in Jimmie Dale’s hand now, circled the room with its\nlittle round white ray, lingering an instant in a queer, inquisitive\nsort of way here and there on this object and that–and went out.\nJimmie Dale nodded–the flat desk in the centre of the floor, the\nsafe in the corner by the rear wall, the position of everything in\nthe room, even to the chairs, was photographed on his mind.",
        "He stepped from the portieres to the safe, and the flashlight played\nagain–this time reflecting back from the glistening nickelled\nknobs.  Jimmie Dale’s lips tightened.  It was a small safe, almost\nludicrously small; but to such height as the art of safe design had\nbeen carried, that design was embodied in the one before him.",
        "“Type K-four-two-eight-Colby,” muttered Jimmie Dale.  “A nasty\nlittle beggar–and it’s eleven o’clock now!  I’d use ’soup’ for\nonce, if it weren’t that it would put Stangeist wise, and give him a\nchance to make his get-away before the district attorney got the\nnippers on the four of them.”",
        "The light went out.  Jimmie Dale dropped to his knees; and, while\nhis left hand passed swiftly, tentatively over dials and handle, he\nrubbed the fingers of his right hand rapidly to and fro over the\ncarpet.  Wonderful finger tips were those of Jimmie Dale, sensitive\nto an abnormal degree; and now, tingling with the friction, the\nnerves throbbing at the skin surface, they closed in a light,\ndelicate touch upon the knob of the dial–and Jimmie Dale’s ear\npressed close against the face of the safe.",
        "Time passed.  The silence grew heavy–seemed to palpitate through\nthe room.  Then a deep breath, half like a sigh, half like a\nfluttering sob as of a strong man taxed to the uttermost of his\nendurance, came from Jimmie Dale, and his left hand swept away the\nsweat beads that had spurted to his forehead.",
        "“Eight–thirteen–twenty-two,” whispered Jimmie Dale.",
        "There was a click, a low metallic thud as the bolts slid back, and\nthe door swung open.",
        "And now the flashlight again, searching the mechanism of the inner\ndoor–then darkness once more.",
        "Five minutes, ten minutes went by.  The clock struck again–and the\nsingle stroke seemed to boom out through the house in a weird,\nraucous, threatening note, and seemed to linger, throbbing in the\nair.",
        "The inner door was open–the flashlight’s ray was flooding a nest of\npigeonholes and little drawers.  The pigeonholes were crammed with\npapers, as, presumably, too, were the drawers.  Jimmie Dale sucked\nin his breath.  He had already been there well over half an hour–\nevery minute now, every second was counting against him, and to\nsearch that mass of papers before Stangeist returned was–",
        "“Ah!\"–it came in a fierce little ejaculation from Jimmie Dale.\nFrom the centre pigeonhole, almost the first paper he had touched,\nhe drew a long, sealed envelope and at a single swift glance had\nread the inscription upon it, written in longhand:",
        "TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY,\nNEW YORK CITY.",
        "The words in the corners were underscored three times.",
        "Swiftly, deftly, Jimmie Dale’s hands rolled the rounded end of one\nof his collection of the legal instruments under the flap of the\nenvelope, turned the sheets over and drew out the folded document\ninside.  There were eight sheets of legal foolscap, neatly fastened\ntogether at the top left-hand corner with green tape.  He opened\nthem out, read a few words here and there, and turned the pages\nhurriedly over to scrutinise the last one–and nodded grimly.  Three\nwitnesses had testified to the signature of Stangeist, and a\nnotary’s seal, accompanied by the usual legal formula, was duly\naffixed.",
        "Jimmie Dale slipped the document into his pocket, and, with the\nenvelope in his hand, moved to the desk.  He opened first one drawer\nand then another, and finally discovering a pile of blank foolscap,\ntook out four sheets, folded them, and placed them in the envelope,\nsealing the flap of the latter again.  That it did not seal very\nwell now brought a quizzical twitch to Jimmie Dale’s lips.  Sealed\nor unsealed, perhaps, it made little difference; but, for all that,\nhe was not through with it yet.  Apart from bringing the four to\njustice, there was, after all, a chance to vindicate the Gray Seal\nin this matter at least, and repudiate the newspaper theory which\nthe public, to whom the Gray Seal was already a monster of iniquity,\nwould seize upon with avidity.",
        "There was no further need of light now.  Jimmie Dale replaced the\nflashlight in his pocket, took out the thin, metal case, opened it,\nand with the tiny pair of tweezers that likewise nestled there,\nlifted out one of the gray, diamond-shaped paper seals.  There was\nno question but that, once under arrest, Stangeist’s effects would\nbe immediately and thoroughly searched by the authorities!  Jimmie\nDale’s smile from quizzical became ironic.  It would afford the\npolice another little, bewildering reminder of the Gray Seal, and\ngive Carruthers, good old Carruthers of the MORNING NEWS-ARGUS, so\ninnocently ignorant that the Gray Seal was his old college pal, yet\nthe one editor of them all who was not forever barking and yelping\nat the Gray Seal’s heels, a chance to vindicate himself a little,\ntoo!  Jimmie Dale moistened the adhesive side of the gray seal, and,\nstill mindful of tell-tale finger prints, laid it with the tweezers\non the flap of the envelope, and pressed it firmly into place with\nhis elbow.",
        "And then, suddenly, every faculty instantly on the alert, he\nsnatched up the envelope from the desk, and listened.  Was it\nimagination, a trick of nerves, or–no, there it was again!–a\nfootfall on the gravel walk at the front of the house.  The sound\nbecame louder, clearer–two footfalls instead of one.  It was\nStangeist, and somebody was with him.",
        "In an instant Jimmie Dale was across the room and kneeling again\nbefore the safe.  His fingers were flying now.  The envelope shot\nback into the pigeonhole from which he had taken it–the inner door\nof the safe closed silently and swiftly.",
        "A dry chuckle came from Jimmie Dale’s lips.  It was just like\nfiction, just precisely time enough to have accomplished what he had\ncome for before he was interrupted, not a second more or less, the\nvillain foiled at the psychological moment!  The key was rattling in\nthe front door now–they were in the hall–he could hear Stangeist’s\nvoice–there came a dull glow from the hallway, following the click\nof an electric-light switch.  The outer door of the safe swung shut,\nthe bolts slid into place, the dial whirled under Jimmie Dale’s\nfingers.  It was only a step to the portieres, the open window–and\nescape.  He straightened up, stepped back, the portieres closed\nbehind him–and the chuckle died on Jimmie Dale’s lips.",
        "He was trapped–caught without so much as a corner in which to turn!\nStangeist was even then coming into the room–and OUTSIDE, darkly\noutlined, two forms stood just beneath the window.  Instinctively,\nquick as a flash, Jimmie Dale crouched below the sill.  Who were\nthey?  What did it mean?  Questions swept in swift sequence through\nhis brain.  Had they seen him?  It would be very dark against the\nbackground of the portieres, but yet if they were watching–he drew\na breath of relief.  He had not been seen.  Their voices reached him\nin low, guarded whispers.",
        "“Say, youse, Ike, pipe it!   Dere’s a window open in the snitch’s\nroom.  Come on, we’ll get in dere.  It’ll make the hair stand up on\nthe back of his neck fer a starter.”",
        "“Aw, ferget it! “ replied another voice.  “Can the tee-ayter stunt!\nClarie leaves the front door unfastened, don’t he?  An’ dey’ll be in\ndere in a minute now.  Wotcher want ter do?  Crab the game?  He\nmight hear us an’ fix Clarie before we had a chanst, the skinny old\nfox!  An’ dere’s the light now–see!  Beat it on yer toes fer the\nfront of the house!”",
        "The room was flooded with light.  Through the portieres, that Jimmie\nDale parted by the barest fraction of an inch, he could see\nStangeist and another man, a thick-set, ugly-faced-looking customer–\nClarie Deane, according to that brief, whispered colloquy that he\nhad heard outside.  He looked again through the window.  The two\ndark forms had disappeared now, but they had disappeared just a few\nseconds too late–with the two other men now in the room, and one of\nthem so close that Jimmie Dale could almost have reached out and\ntouched him, it was impossible to get through the window without\nbeing detected, when the slightest sound would attract instant\nattention and equally instant suspicion.  It was a chance to be\ntaken only as a last resort.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face grew hard, as his fingers closed around his\nautomatic and drew the weapon from his pocket.  It was all plain\nenough.  That last act in the drama which he had speculatively\nanticipated was being staged with little loss of time–and in a grim\nsort of way the thought flashed across his mind that, perilous as\nhis own position was, Stangeist at that moment was in even greater\nperil than himself.  Australian Ike, The Mope, and Clarie Deane,\ngiven the chance, and they seemed to have made that chance now, were\nnot likely to deal in half measures–Clarie Deane had dropped into a\nchair beside the desk; and The Mope and Australian Ike were creeping\naround to the front door!",
        "The parting in the portieres widened a little more, a very little\nmore, slowly, imperceptibly, until Jimmie Dale, by the simple\nexpedient of moving his head, could obtain an unobstructed view of\nthe entire room.",
        "Stangeist tossed a bag he had been carrying on the desk, pulled up a\nchair opposite to Clarie Deane, and sat down.  Both men were side\nface to Jimmie Dale.",
        "“You tell the boys,” said Stangeist abruptly, “to fade away after\nthis for a while.  Things are getting too hot.  And you tell The\nMope I dock him five hundred for that extra crunch on Roessle’s\nskull.  That sort of thing isn’t necessary.  That’s the kind of\nstunt that gets the public sore–the man was dead enough as it was.\nSee?”",
        "“Sure!”  Clarie Deane’s ejaculation was a grunt.",
        "Stangeist opened the bag, and dumped the contents on the desk–pile\nafter pile of banknotes, the pay roll of the Martindale-Kensington\nMills.",
        "“Some haul!” observed Clarie Deane, with a hoarse chuckle.  “The\npapers said over twenty thousand.”",
        "“You can’t always believe what the papers say,” returned Stangeist\ncurtly; and, taking a scribbling pad from the desk, began to check\nup the packages.",
        "Clarie Deane’s cigar had gone out.  He rolled the short stub in his\nmouth, and leaned forward.",
        "The bills were evidently just as they had been delivered to the\nmurdered paymaster at the bank, done up with little narrow paper\nbands in packages of one hundred notes each, save for a small bundle\nof loose bills which latter, with the rolls of silver, Stangeist\nswept to one side of the desk.",
        "Package by package, Stangeist went on jotting the amounts down on\nthe pad.",
        "“Nix!” growled Clarie Deane suddenly.  “Cut that out!  Them’s fivers\nin that wad.  Make that five hundred instead of one–I’m onter yer!”",
        "“Mistake,” said Stangeist suavely, changing the figures with his\npencil.  “You’re pretty wide awake for this time of night, aren’t\nyou, Clarie?”",
        "“Oh, I dunno!” responded Clarie Deane gruffly.  “Not so very!”",
        "Stangeist, finished with the packages, picked up the loose bills,\nand, with a short laugh, tossed them into the bag and followed them\nwith the rolls of silver.  He pushed the bag toward Clarie Deane.",
        "“That’s a little extra for you,” he said.  “The trouble with you\nfellows is that you don’t know when you’re well off–but the sooner\nyou find it out the better, unless you want another lesson like\nyesterday.”  He made the addition on the pad.  “Fifteen thousand,\neight hundred dollars,” he announced softly.  “That’s seven\nthousand, nine hundred for the three of you to divide, less five\nhundred from The Mope.”",
        "Clarie Deane’s eyes narrowed.  His hands were on his knees, hidden\nby the desk.",
        "“There’s more’n twenty there,” he said sullenly–and drew a match\nacross the under edge of the desk with a long, crackling noise.",
        "Stangeist’s face lost its suavity, a snarl curled his lips; but,\nabout to reply, he sprang suddenly to his feet instead, his head\nturned sharply toward the door.",
        "“What’s that!” he said hoarsely.  “It’s not the servants, they\nwouldn’t dare to–”",
        "Stangeist’s words ended in a gulp.  He was staring into the muzzle\nof a heavy-calibered revolver that Clarie Deane had jerked up from\nunder the desk.",
        "“You sit down, or I’ll blow your block off!” said Clarie Deane, with\na sudden leer.",
        "It happened then almost before Jimmie Dale could grasp the details;\nbefore even Clarie Deane himself could interfere.  The door burst\nopen, two men rushed in–and one, with a bound, flung himself at\nStangeist.  The man’s hand, grasping a clubbed revolver, rose in the\nair, descended on Stangeist’s head–and Stangeist went down in a\nlimp heap, crashed into the chair, and slid from the chair with a\nthud to the floor.",
        "There was an oath from Clarie Deane.  He jumped from his seat, and\nwith a violent shove sent the man reeling half across the room.",
        "“Blast you, Mope!” he snarled.  “You’re too blamed fly!  D’ye\nwanter queer the whole biz?”",
        "“Aw, wot’s the matter wid youse!”  The Mope, purple-faced with rage,\nlittle black eyes glittering, mouth working under a flattened nose\nthat some previous encounter had broken and bent over the side of\nhis face, advanced belligerently.",
        "Australian Ike, who had entered the room with him, pulled him back.",
        "“Ferget it!” he flung out.  “Clarie’s dealin’ the deck.  Ferget it!”",
        "The Mope glared from one to the other; then shook his fist at\nStangeist on the floor.",
        "“Youse two make me sick!” he sneered.  “Wot’s the use of waitin’ all\nnight?  We was to bump him off, anyway, wasn’t we?  Dat’s wot youse\nsaid yerselves, ’cause wot was ter stop him writin’ out another\npaper if we didn’t fix him fer keeps?”",
        "“That’s all right,” rejoined Clarie Deane; “but that’s the second\nact, you bonehead, see!  We ain’t got the paper yet, have we?  Say,\ntake a look at that safe!  It’s easier ter scare him inter openin’\nit than ter crack it, ain’t it?”",
        "Jimmie Dale, from his crouched position, began to rise to his feet\nslowly, making but the slightest movement at a time, cautious of the\nleast sound.  His lips were like a thin line, his fingers tightly\npressed over the automatic in his hand.  There was not room for him\nbetween the portieres and the window; and, do what he could, the\nhangings bulged a little.  Let one of the three notice that, or\ninadvertently brush against the portieres, and his life would not be\nworth an instant’s purchase.",
        "They were lifting Stangeist up now, propping him up in the chair.\nStangeist moaned, opened his eyes, stared in a dazed way at the\nthree faces that leered into his, then dawning intelligence came,\nand his face, that had been white before, took on a pasty, grayish\npallor.",
        "“You–the three of you!” he mumbled.  “What’s this mean?”",
        "And then Clarie Deane laughed in a low, brutal way.",
        "“Wot d’ye think it means?  We want that paper, an’ we want it damn\nquick–see!  D’ye think we was goin’ ter stand fer havin’ a trip ter\nSing Sing an’ the wire chair danglin’ over our heads!”",
        "Stangeist closed his eyes.  When he opened them again, something of\nthe old-time craftiness was in his face.",
        "“Well, what are you going to do about it?” he inquired, almost\nsharply.  “You know what will happen to you, if anything happens to\nme.”",
        "“Don’t youse kid yerself!” retorted Clarie Deane.  “D’ye think we’re\nfools?  This ain’t like it was yesterday–see!  We GETS the paper\nthis time–so there won’t nothin’ happen to us.  You come across\nwith it blasted quick now, or The Mope’ll give you another on the\nbean that’ll put you to sleep fer keeps!”",
        "The blood was running down Stangeist’s face.  He wiped it away from\nhis eyes.",
        "“It’s not here,” he said innocently.  “It’s in my box in the safety-\ndeposit vaults.”",
        "“Aw,” blurted out Australian Ike, pushing suddenly forward, “youse\ncan’t work dat crawl on–”",
        "“Cut it out, Ike!” snapped Clarie Dane.  “I’m runnin’ this!  So it’s\nin the vaults, eh?”  He shoved his face toward Stangeist’s.",
        "“Yes,” said Stangeist easily.  “You see–I was looking for something\nlike this.”",
        "Clarie Deane’s fist clenched.",
        "“You lie!” he choked.  “The Mope, here, was the last of us you\nshowed the paper to yesterday afernoon, an’ the vaults was closed\nthen–an’ you ain’t been there to-day, ’cause you’ve been watched.\nThat’s why we fixed it fer to-night after the divvy that you’ve just\ntried ter do us on again, ’cause we knew you had it here.”",
        "“I tell you, it’s not here,” said Stangeist evenly.",
        "“You lie!” said Clarie Deane again.  “It’s in that safe.  The Mope\nheard you tell the girl in yer office that if anything happened to you\nshe was ter wise up the district attorney that there was a paper in\nyour safe at home fer him that was important.  Now then, you beat it\nover ter that safe, an’ open it up–we’ll give you a minute ter do\nit in.”",
        "“The paper’s not there, I tell you,” said Stangeist once more.",
        "“That’s all right,” submitted Clarle Deane grimly.  “There’s a\nquarter of that minute gone.”",
        "“I won’t!” Stangeist flashed out violently.",
        "“That’s all right,” repeated Clarie Deane.  “There’s half of that\nminute gone.”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes, in a fascinated sort of way, were on Stangeist.\nThe man’s face was twitching now, moisture began to ooze from his\nforehead, as the callous brutality of the scowling faces seemed to\nget him–and then he lurched suddenly forward in his chair.",
        "“My God!” he cried out, a ring of terror in his voice “What do you\nmean to do?  You’ll pay for it!  They’ll get you!  The servants will\nbe back in a minute.”",
        "“Two skirts!” jeered Clarie Deane.  We ain’t goin’ ter run away from\nthem.  If they comes before we goes, we’ll fix ’em.  That minute’s\nup!”",
        "Stangeist licked his lips with his tongue.",
        "“Suppose–suppose I refuse?” he said hoarsely.",
        "“You can suit yerself,” said Clarie Deane, with a vicious grin.  “We\nknow the paper’s there, an’ we gets it before we leaves here–see?\nYou can take yer choice.  Either you goes over ter the safe an’\nopens it yerself, or else\"–he paused and produced a small bottle\nfrom his pocket–\"this is nitro-glycerin’, an’ we opens it fer you\nwith this.  Only if we does the job we does it proper.  We ties you\nup and sets you against the door of the safe before we touches off\nthe ’soup,’ an’ mabbe if yer a good guesser you can guess the rest.”",
        "There was a short, raucous guffaw from The Mope.",
        "Stangeist turned a drawn face toward the man, stared at him, and\nstared in a miserable way at the other two in turn.  He licked his\nlips again–none was in a better position than himself to know that\nthere would be neither scruples nor hesitancy to interfere with\ncarrying out the threat.",
        "“Suppose,” he said, trying to keep his voice steady, “suppose I open\nthe safe–what then–afterward?”",
        "“We ain’t got the safe open yet,” countered Clarie Deane\nuncompromisingly.  “An’ we ain’t got no more time ter fool over it,\neither.  You get a move on before I counts five, or The Mope an’ Ike\nties you up!  One–”",
        "Stangeist staggered to his feet, wiped the blood out of his eyes for\nthe second time, and, with lips working, went unsteadily across the\nroom to the safe.",
        "He knelt before it, and began to manipulate the dial; while the\nothers crowded around behind him.  The Mope was fingering his\nrevolver again club fashion.  Australian Ike’s elbow just grazed the\nportieres, and Jimmie Dale flattened himself against the window,\nholding his breath–a smile on his lips that was mirthless, deadly,\ncold.  The end was not far off now; and then–WHAT?",
        "Stangeist had the outer door of the safe open now–and now the inner\ndoor swung back.  He reached in his hand to the pigeonhole, drew out\nthe envelope–and with a sudden, wild cry, reeled to his feet.",
        "“My God!” he screamed out.  “What’s–what’s this!”",
        "Clarie Deane snatched the envelope from him.",
        "“THE GRAY SEAL!\"–the words came with a jerk from his lips.  He\nripped the envelope open frantically–and like a man stunned gazed\nat the four blank sheets, while the colour left his face.  “IT’S\nGONE!” he cried out hoarsely.",
        "“Gone!”  There was a burst of oaths from Australian Ike.  “Gone!\nDen we’re nipped–de lot of us!”",
        "The Mope’s face was like a maniac’s as he whirled on Stangeist.",
        "“Sure!” he croaked.  “But youse gets yers first, youse–”",
        "With a cry, Stangeist, to elude the blow, ducked blindly backward–\ninto the portieres–and with a rip and tear the hangings were\nwrenched apart.",
        "It came instantaneously–a yell of mingled surprise and fury from\nthe three–the crash and spit of Jimmie Dale’s revolver as he fired\none shot at the floor to stop their rush–then he flung himself at\nthe window, through it, and dropped sprawling to the ground.",
        "A stream of flame cut the darkness above him, a bullet whistled by\nhis head–another–and another.  He was on his feet, quick as a cat,\nand running close alongside of the wall of the house.  He heard a\nthud behind him, still another, and yet a third–they were dropping\nthrough the window after him.  Came another shot, an angry hum of\nthe bullet closer than before–then the pound of racing feet.",
        "Jimmie Dale swung around the corner of the house, running at top\nspeed.  Something that was like a hot iron suddenly burned and\nseared along the side of his head just above the ear.  He reeled,\nstaggered, recovered himself, and dashed on.  It nauseated him, that\nstinging in his head, and all at once seemed to be draining his\nstrength away.  The shouts, the shots, the running feet became like\na curious buzzing in his ears.  It seemed strange that they should\nhave hit him, that he should be wounded!  If he could only reach the\nlow stone wall by the road, he could at least make a fight for his\nlife on the other side!",
        "Red streaks swam before Jimmie Dale’s eyes.  The wall was such a\nlong way off–a yard or two was a very long way more to go–the\nweakness seemed to be creeping up now even to numb his brain.  No,\nhere was the wall–they hadn’t hit him again–he laughed in a\ndemented way–and rolled his body over, and fell to the other side.",
        "“Jimmie!”",
        "The cry seemed to reach some inner consciousness, revive him, send\nthe blood whipping through his veins.  That voice!  It was her–\nHERS!  The Tocsin!  There was an automobile, engine racing, standing\nthere in the road.  He won to his feet–dark, rushing forms were\nalmost at the wall.  He fired–once–twice–fired again–and turned,\nstaggering for the car.",
        "“Jimmie!  Jimmie–QUICK!”",
        "Panting, gasping, he half fell into the tonneau.  The car leaped\nforward, yells filled the air–but only one thing was dominant in\nJimmie Dale’s reeling brain now.  He pulled himself up to his feet,\nand leaned over the back of the seat, reaching for the slim figure\nthat was bent over the wheel.",
        "“It’s you–you at last!” he cried.  “Your face–let me lee your\nface!”",
        "A bullet split the back panel of the car–little spurting flames\nwere dancing out from the roadway behind,",
        "“Are you mad!” she shouted back at him.  “Let me steer–do you want\nthem to hit me!”",
        "“No-o,” said Jimmie Dale, in a queer singsong sort of way, and his\nhead seemed to spin dizzily around.  “No–I guess–”  He choked.\n\"The paper–it’s in–my pocket\"–and he went down unconscious on the\nfloor of the car.",
        "When he recovered his senses he was lying on a couch in a plainly\nfurnished room, and a man, a stranger, red, jovial-faced, farmerish\nlooking, was bending over him.",
        "“Where am I?” he demanded finally, propping himself up on his elbow.",
        "“You’re all right,” replied the man.  “She said you’d come around in\na little while.”",
        "“Who said so?” inquired Jimmie Dale.",
        "“She did.  The woman who brought you here about five minutes ago.\nShe said she ran you down with her car.”",
        "“Oh!” said Jimmie Dale.  He felt his head–it was bandaged, and\nit was bandaged, he was quite sure, with a piece of torn underskirt.\nHe looked at the man again.  “You haven’t told me yet where I am.”",
        "“Long Island,” the other answered.  “My name’s Hanson.  I keep a bit\nof a truck garden here.”",
        "“Oh,” said Jimmie Dale again.",
        "The man crossed the room, picked up an envelope from the table, and\ncame back to Jimmie Dale.",
        "“She said to give you this as soon as you got your senses, and asked\nus to put you up for a while, as long as you wanted to stay, and\npaid us for it, too.  She’s all right, she is.  You don’t want to\nhold the accident up against her, she was mighty sorry about it.\nAnd now I’ll go and see if the old lady’s got your room ready while\nyou’re readin’ your letter.”",
        "The man left the room.",
        "Jimmie Dale sat up on the couch, and tore the envelope open.  The\nnote, scrawled in pencil, began abruptly:",
        "You were quite a problem.  I couldn’t take you HOME–could I?  I\ncouldn’t take you to what you call the Sanctuary could I?  I\ncouldn’t take you to a hospital, nor call in a doctor–the stain you\nuse wouldn’t stand it.  But, thank God!  I know it’s only a flesh\nwound, and you are all right where you are for the day or two that\nyou must keep quiet and take care of yourself.  By the time you read\nthis the paper will be on the way to the proper hands, and by\nmorning the four where they should be.  There were a few articles in\nyour clothes I thought it better to take charge of in case–well, in\ncase of ACCIDENT.”",
        "Jimmie Dale tore the note up, and smiled wryly at the door.  He felt\nin his pockets.  Mask, revolver, burglar’s tools, and the thin metal\ninsignia case were gone.",
        "“And I had the sublime optimism,” murmured Jimmie Dale, “to spend\nmonths trying to find her as Larry the Bat!”",
        "The bullet wound along the side of his head and just above his ear\nwould have been a very awkward thing indeed, in more ways than one,\nfor Jimmie Dale, the millionaire, to have explained at his club, in\nhis social set, or even to his servants, and of these latter to\nJason the Solicitous in particular; but for Jimmie Dale as Larry the\nBat it was a matter of little moment.  There was none to question\nLarry the Bat, save in a most casual and indifferent way; and a\nbandage of any description, primarily and above all one that he\ncould arrange himself, with only himself to take note of the\nincongruous hues of skin where the stain, the grease paint, and the\nmake-up was washed off, would excite little attention in that world\nwhere daily affrays were common-place happenings, and a wound, for\nwhatever reason, had long since lost the tang of novelty.  Why then\nshould it arouse even a passing interest if Larry the Bat, credited\nas the most confirmed of dope fiends, should have fallen down the\ndark, rickety stairs of the tenement in one of his orgies, and, in\nthe expressive language of the Bad Lands, cracked his bean!",
        "And so Jimmie Dale had been forced to maintain the role of Larry the\nBat for a far longer period than he had anticipated when, ten days\nbefore, he had assumed it for the night’s work that had so nearly\nresulted fatally for himself, though it had placed Roessle’s\nmurderers behind the bars.  For, the next day, unwilling to court\nthe risk of remaining in that neighbourhood, he had left Hanson’s,\nthe farmer’s, house on Long Island where the Tocsin had carried him\nin an unconscious state, telephoned Jason that he had been\nunexpectedly called out of town for a few days, and returned to the\nSanctuary in New York.  And here, to his grim dismay, he had found\nthe underworld in a state of furious, angry unrest, like a nest of\nhornets, stirred up, seeking to wreak vengeance on an unseen\nassailant.",
        "For years, as the Gray Seal, Jimmie Dale had lived with the slogan\nof the police, “The Gray Seal dead or alive–but the Gray Seal!\"\nsounding in his ears; with the newspapers screaming their diatribes,\narousing the people against him, nagging the authorities into\nsleepless, frenzied efforts to trap him; with a price upon his head\nthat was large enough to make a man, not too pretentious, rich for\nlife–but in the underworld, until then, the name of the Gray Seal\nhad been one to conjure with, for the underworld had sworn by the\nunknown master criminal, and had spoken his name with a reverence\nthat was none the less genuine even if pungently tainted with\nunholiness.  But now it was different.  Up and down through the Bad\nLands, in gambling hells, in vicious resorts, in the hiding places\nwhere thugs and crooks burrowed themselves away from the daylight,\nthrough the heart and the outskirts of the underworld travelled the\nfiat, whispered out of mouths crooked to one side–DEATH TO THE GRAY\nSEAL!",
        "Gangland differences were forgotten in the larger issue of the\ncommon weal.  The gang spirit became the spirit of a united whole,\nand the crime fraternity buzzed and hummed poisonously, spurred on\nby hatred, thirst for revenge, fear, and, perhaps most potent of\nall, a hideous suspicion now of each other.",
        "The underworld had received a shock at which it stood aghast, and\nwhich, with its terrifying possibilities, struck consternation into\nthe soul of every individual of that brotherhood whose bond was\ncrime, who was already “wanted” for some offence or other, whether\nit ranged from murder in the first degree to some petty piece of\nsneak thievery.  Stangeist, the Indian chief, the lawyer whose\ncunning brain had stood as a rampart between the underworld and a\nprison cell, was himself now in the Tombs with the certainty of the\nelectric chair before him; and with him, the same fate equally\nassured, were Australian Ike, The Mope, and Clarie Deane!\nAristocrats of the Bad Lands, peers of that inglorious realm were\nthose four–and the blow had fallen with stunning force, a blow that\nin itself would have been enough to have stirred the underworld to\nits depths.  But that was not all–from the cells in the Tombs, from\nthe four came the word, and passed from mouth to mouth in that\nstrange underground exchange until all had heard it, that the Gray\nSeal had “SQUEALED.”  The Gray Seal who, though unknown, they had\ncounted the most eminent among themselves, had squealed!  Who was\nthe Gray Seal?  It he had held the secrets of Stangeist and his\nband, what else might he not know?  Who else might not fall next?\nThe Gray Seal had become a snitch, a menace, a source of danger that\nstalked among them like a ghastly spectre.  Who was the Gray Seal?\nNone knew.",
        "“Death to the Gray Seal!  Run him to earth!” went the whisper from\nlip to lip; and with the whisper men stared uncertainly into each\nother’s faces, fearful that the one to whom they spoke might even\nbe–the Gray Seal!",
        "Jimmie Dale’s lips twisted queerly as he looked around him at the\nsqualid appointments of the Sanctuary.  The police were bad enough,\nthe papers were worse; but this was a still graver peril.  With\nevery denizen of the underworld below the dead line suspicious of\neach other, their lives, the penitentiary, or a prison sentence the\nstakes against which each one played, the role of Larry the Bat,\nclever as was the make-up and disguise, was fraught now more than\never before with danger and peril.  It seemed as though slowly the\nnet was beginning at last to tighten around him.",
        "The murky, yellow flame of the gas jet flickered suddenly, as though\nin acquiescence with the quick, impulsive shrug of Jimmie Dale’s\nshoulders–and Jimmie Dale, bending to peer into the cracked mirror\nthat was propped up on the broken-legged table, knotted his dress\ntie almost fastidiously.  The hair, if just a trifle too long,\ncovered the scar on his head now, the wound no longer required a\nbandage, and Larry the Bat, for the time being at least, had\ndisappeared.  Across the foot of the bed, neatly folded, lay his\ndress coat and overcoat, but little creased for all that they had\nlain in that hiding-place under the flooring since the night when,\nhurrying from the club, he had placed them there to assume instead\nthe tatters of Larry the Bat.  It was Jimmie Dale in his own person\nagain who stood there now in Larry the Bat’s disreputable den, an\nincongruous figure enough against the background of his miserable\nsurroundings, in perfect-fitting shoes and trousers, the broad\nexpanse of spotless white shirt bosom glistening even in the\npoverty-stricken flare from the single, sputtering gas jet.",
        "Jimmie Dale took the watch from his pocket that had not been wound\nfor many days, wound it mechanically, set it by guesswork–it was\nnot far from eight o’clock–and replaced it in his pocket.\nCarefully then, one at a time, he examined his fingers, long, slim,\nsensitive, tapering fingers, magical masters of safes and locks and\nvaults of the most intricate and modern mechanism–no single trace\nof grime remained, they were metamorphosed hands from the filthy\npaws of Larry the Bat.  He nodded in satisfaction; and picked up the\nmirror for a final inspection of himself, that, this time, did not\nmiss a single line in his face or neck.  Again Jimmie Dale nodded.\nAs though he had vanished into thin air, as though he had never\nexisted, not a trace of Larry the Bat remained–except the heap of\nrags upon the floor, the battered slouch hat, the frayed trousers,\nthe patched boots with their broken laces, the mismated socks, the\ngrimy flannel shirt, and the old coat that he had just discarded.",
        "The mirror was replaced on the table; and, pushing the heap of\nclothes before him with his foot, Jimmie Dale knelt down in the\ncorner of the room where the oilcloth had been turned up and the\nloose planking of the floor removed, and began to pack the articles\naway in the hole.  Jimmie Dale rolled the trousers of Larry the Bat\ninto a compact little bundle, and stuffed them under the flooring.\nThe gas jet seemed to blink again in a sort of confidential\napproval, as though the secret lay inviolate between itself and\nJimmie Dale.  Through the closed window, shade tightly drawn, came,\nlow and muffled, the sound of distant life from the Bowery, a few\nblocks away.  The gas jet, suffering from air somewhere within the\npipes, hissed angrily, the yellow flame died to a little blue,\nforked spurt–and Jimmie Dale was on his feet, his face suddenly\nhard and white as marble.",
        "Some One Was Knocking At the Door!",
        "For the fraction of a second Jimmie Dale stood motionless.  Found as\nJimmie Dale in the den of Larry the Bat, and the consequences\nrequired no effort of the imagination to picture them; police or\ndenizen of the underworld who was knocking there, it was all the\nsame, the method of death would be a little different, that was all–\none legalised, the other not.  Jimmie Dale, Larry the Bat, the Gray\nSeal, once uncovered, could expect as much quarter as would be given\nto a cornered rat.  His eyes swept the room with a swift, critical\nglance–evidences of Larry the Bat, the clothes, were still about,\neven if he in the person of Jimmie Dale, alone damning enough, were\nnot standing there himself.  And he was even weaponless–the Tocsin\nhad taken the revolver from his pocket, together with those other\ntelltale articles, the mask, the flashlight, the little blued-steel\ntools, before she had intrusted him that night, wounded and\nunconscious, to Hanson’s care.",
        "Jimmie Dale slipped his feet out of his low evening pumps, snatched\nup the old coat and hat from the pile, put them on, and, without a\nsound, reached the gas jet and turned it off.  A second had gone by–\nno more–the knocking still sounded insistently on the door.  It\nwas dark now, perfectly black.  He started across the room, his\ntread absolutely silent as the trained muscles, relaxing, threw the\nbody weight gradually upon one foot before the next step was taken.\nIt was like a shadow, a little blacker in outline than the\nsurrounding blackness, stealing across the floor.",
        "Halfway to the door he paused.  The knocking had ceased.  He\nlistened intently.  It was not repeated.  Instead, his ear caught a\nguarded step retreating outside in the hall.  Jimmie Dale drew a\nbreath of relief.  He went on again to the door, still listening.\nWas it a trap–that step outside?",
        "At the door now, tense, alert, he lowered his ear to the keyhole.\nThere came the faintest creak from the stairs.  Jimmie Dale’s brows\ngathered.  It was strange!  The knocking had not lasted long.\nWhoever it was was going away–but it required the utmost caution to\ndescend those stairs, rickety and tumble-down as they were, with no\nmore sound than that!  Why such caution?  Why not a more determined\nand prolonged effort at his door–the visitor had been easily\nsatisfied that Larry the Bat was not within.  TOO easily satisfied!\nJimmie Dale turned the key noiselessly in the lock.  He opened the\ndoor cautiously–half inch–an inch, there was no sound of footsteps\nnow.  Occasionally a lodger moved about on the floor above;\noccasionally from somewhere in the tenement came the murmur of\nvoices as from behind closed door–that was all.  All else was\nsilence and darkness now.",
        "The door, on its well-oiled hinges, swung wide open.  Jimmie Dale\nthrust out his head into the hall–and something fell upon the\nthreshold with a little thud–but for a moment Jimmie Dale did not\nmove.  Listening, trying to pierce the darkness, he was as still as\nthe silence around him; then he stooped and groped along the\nthreshold.  His hand closed upon what seemed like a small box\nwrapped in paper.  He picked it up, closed and locked the door\nagain, and retreated back across the room.  It was strange–\nunpleasantly strange–a box propped stealthily against the door so\nthat it would fall to the threshold when the door was opened!  And\nwhy the stealth?  What did it mean?  Had the underworld with its\nthousand eyes and ears already succeeded in a few days where the\npolice had failed signally for years–had they sent him this,\nwhatever it was, as some grim token that they had run Larry the Bat\nto earth?  He shook his head.  No; gangland struck more swiftly,\nwith less finesse than that–the “cat-and-mouse” act was never one\nit favoured, for the mouse had been known to get away.",
        "Jimmie Dale lighted the gas again, and turned the package over in\nhis hands.  It was, as he had surmised, a small cardboard box; and\nit was wrapped in plain paper and tied with a string.  He untied the\nstring, and still suspicious, as a man is suspicious in the\nknowledge that he is stalked by peril at every turn, removed the\nwrapper a little gingerly.  It was still without sign or marking\nupon it, just an ordinary cardboard box.  He lifted off the cover,\nand, with a short, sudden laugh, stared, a little out of\ncountenance, at the contents.",
        "On the top lay a white, unaddressed envelope.  HERS!  Beneath–he\nemptied the box on the table–his black silk mask, his automatic\nrevolver, the kit of fine, small blued-steel burglar’s tools, his\npocket flashlight, and the thin metal insignia case.  The Tocsin!\nImpulsively Jimmie Dale turned toward the door–and stopped.  His\nshoulders lifted in a shrug that, meant to be philosophical, was far\nfrom philosophical.  He could not, dared not venture far through the\ntenement dressed as he was; and even if he could there were three\nexits to the Sanctuary, a fact that now for the first time was not\nwholly a source of unmixed satisfaction to him; and besides–she was\ngone!",
        "Jimmie Dale opened the letter, a grim smile playing on his lips.  He\nhad forgotten for the moment that the illusion he had cherished for\nyears in the belief that she did not know Larry the Bat as an alias\nof Jimmie Dale was no more than–an illusion.  Well, it had been a\npiece of consummate egotism on his part, that was all.  But, after\nall, what did it matter?  He had had his innings, tried in the role\nof Larry the Bat to solve her identity, devoted weeks on end to the\nattempt–and failed.  Some day, perhaps, his turn would come; some\nday, perhaps, she would no longer be able to elude him, unless–the\nletter crackled suddenly in his fingers–unless the house that they\nhad built on such strange and perilous foundations crashed at some\nmoment, without an instant’s warning, in disaster and ruin to the\nground.  Who knew but that this letter now, another call to the Gray\nSeal to act, another peril invited, would be the LAST?  There must\nbe an end some day; luck and nerve had their limitations–it had\nalmost ended last week!",
        "“Dear Philanthropic Crook\"–it was the same inevitable beginning.\n\"You are well enough again, aren’t you, Jimmie?–I am sending these\nlittle things back to you, for you will need them to-night.\"–Jimmie\nDale read on, muttering snatches of the letter aloud: “Michael Breen\nprospecting in Alaska–map of location of rich mining claim–\nHamvert, his former partner, had previously fleeced him of fifteen\nthousand dollars–his share of a deal together–Breen was always a\nvery poor man–Breen later struck a claim alone; but, taking sick,\ncame back home–died on arrival in New York after giving map to his\nwife–wife in very needy circumstances–lives with little daughter\nof seven in New Rochelle–works out by the day at Henry Mittel’s\nhouse on the Sound near-by–wife intrusted map for safe-keeping and\nadvice to Mittel–Hamvert after map–telephone wires cut–room one\nhundred and forty-eight, corner, right, first floor, Palais-\nMetropole Hotel, unoccupied–connecting doors–quarter past nine\nto-night–the Weasel–Mittel’s house later–the police–look out for\nboth the Weasel and the police, Jimmie–”",
        "There was more, several pages of it, explanations, specific details\ndown to a minute description of the locality and plan of the house\non the Sound.  Jimmie Dale, too intent now to mutter, read on\nsilently.  At the end he shuffled the sheets a little abstractedly,\nas his face hardened.  Then his fingers began to tear the letter\ninto little shreds, tearing it over and over again, tearing the\nshreds into tiny particles.  He had not been far wrong.  From what\nthe night promised now, this might well be the last letter.  Who\nknew?  There would be need of all the wit and luck and nerve\nto-night that the Gray Seal had ever had before.",
        "With a jerk, Jimmie Dale roused himself from the momentary reverie\ninto which he had fallen; and, all action now, stuffed the torn\npieces of the letter into his trousers pocket to be disposed of\nlater in the street; took off the old coat and slouch hat again, and\nresumed the disposal of Larry the Bat’s effects under the flooring.",
        "This accomplished, he replaced the planking and oilcloth, stood up,\nput on his dress coat and light overcoat, and, from the table,\nstowed the black silk mask, the automatic, the little kit of tools,\nthe flashlight, and the thin metal case away in his pockets.",
        "Jimmie Dale raised his hand to the gas fixture, circled the room\nwith a glance that missed no single detail–then the light went out,\nthe door closed behind him, locked, a dark shadow crept silently\ndown the stairs, out through the side door into the alleyway, along\nthe alleyway close to the wall of the tenement where it was\nblackest, and, satisfied that for the moment there were no passers-\nby, emerged on the street, walking leisurely toward the Bowery.",
        "Once well away from the Sanctuary, however, Jimmie Dale quickened\nhis steps; and twenty minutes later, having stopped but once to\ntelephone to his home on Riverside Drive for his touring car, he was\nbriskly mounting the steps of the St. James Club on Fifth Avenue.\nAnother twenty minutes after that, and he had dismissed Benson, his\nchauffeur, and, at the wheel of his big, powerful machine, was\nspeeding uptown for the Palais-Metropole Hotel.",
        "It was twelve minutes after nine when he drew up at the curb in\nfront of the side entrance of the hotel–his watch, set by\nguesswork, had been a little slow, and he had corrected it at the\nclub.  He was replacing the watch in his pocket as he sauntered\naround the corner, and passed in through the main entrance to the\nbig lobby.",
        "Jimmie Dale avoided the elevators–it was only one flight up, and\nelevator boys on occasions had been known to be observant.  At the\ntop of the first landing, a long, wide, heavily carpeted corridor\nwas before him.  “Number one hundred and forty-eight, the corner\nroom on the right,” the Tocsin had said.  Jimmie Dale walked\nnonchalantly along–past No. 148.  At the lower end of the hall a\ngroup of people were gathered around the elevator doors; halfway\ndown the corridor a bell boy came out of a room and went ahead of\nJimmie Dale.",
        "And then Jimmie Dale stopped suddenly, and began to retrace his\nsteps.  The group had entered the elevator, the bell boy had\ndisappeared around the farther end of the hall into the wing of the\nhotel–the corridor was empty.  In a moment he was standing before\nthe door of No. 148; in another, under the persuasion of a little\nsteel instrument, deftly manipulated by Jimmie Dale’s slim, tapering\nfingers, the lock clicked back, the door opened, and he stepped\ninside, closing and locking the door again behind him.",
        "It was already a quarter past nine, but no one was as yet in the\nconnecting room–the fanlight next door had been dark as he passed.\nHis flashlight swept about him, located the connecting door–and\nwent out.  He moved to the door, tried it, and found it locked.\nAgain the little steel instrument came into play, released the lock,\nand Jimmie Dale opened the door.  Again the flashlight winked.  The\ndoor opened into a bathroom that, obviously, at will, was either\ncommon to the two rooms or could, by the simple expedient of locking\none door or the other, be used by one of the rooms alone.  In the\npresent instance, the occupant of the adjoining apartment had taken\n\"a room with a bath.”",
        "Jimmie Dale passed through the bathroom to the opposite door.  This\nwas already three-quarters open, and swung outward into the bedroom,\nnear the lower end of the room by the window.  Through the crack of\nthe door by the hinges, Jimmie Dale flashed his light, testing the\nradius of vision, pushed the door a few inches wider open, tested it\nagain with the flashlight–and retreated back into No. 148, closing\nthe door on his side until it was just ajar.",
        "He stood there then silently waiting.  It was Hamvert’s room next\ndoor, and Hamvert and the Weasel were already late.  A step sounded\noutside in the corridor.  Jimmie Dale straightened intently.  The\nstep passed on down the hallway and died away.  A false alarm!\nJimmie Dale smiled whimsically.  It was a strange adventure this\nthat confronted him, quite the strangest in a way that the Tocsin\nhad ever planned–and the night lay before him full of peril in its\nextraordinary complications.  To win the hand he must block Hamvert\nand the Weasel without allowing them an inkling that his\ninterference was anything more than, say, the luck of a hotel sneak\nthief at most.  The Weasel was a dangerous man, one of the slickest\nsecond-story workers in the country, with safe cracking as one of\nhis favourite pursuits, a man most earnestly desired by the police,\nprovided the latter could catch him “with the goods.”  As for\nHamvert, he did not know Hamvert, who was a stranger in New York,\nexcept that Hamvert had fleeced a man named Michael Breen out of his\nshare in a claim they had had together when Breen had first gone to\nAlaska to try his luck, and now, having discovered that Breen, when\nprospecting alone somewhere in the interior a month or so ago, had\nfound a rich vein and had made a map or diagram of its location, he,\nHamvert, had followed the other to New York for the purpose of\ngetting it by hook or crook.  Breen’s “find” had been too late;\ntaken sick, he had never worked his claim, had barely got back home\nbefore he died, and only in time to hand his wife the strange legacy\nof a roughly scrawled little piece of paper, and–Jimmie Dale\nstraightened up alertly once more.  Steps again–and this time\ncoming from the direction of the elevator; then voices; then the\nopening of the door of the next room; then a voice, distinctly\naudible:",
        "“Pull up a chair, and we’ll get down to business.  You’re late, as\nit is.  We haven’t any time to waste, if we’re going to wash pay-\ndirt to-night.”",
        "“Aw, dat’s all right!” responded another voice–quite evidently the\nWeasel’s.  “Don’t youse worry–de game’s cinched to a fadeaway.”",
        "There was the sound of chairs being moved across the floor.  Jimmie\nDale slipped the black silk mask over his face, opened the door on\nhis side of the bathroom cautiously, and, without a sound, stepped\ninto the bathroom that was lighted now, of course, by the light\nstreaming in through the partially opened door of Hamvert’s room.\nThe two were talking earnestly now in lower tones.  Jimmie Dale only\ncaught a word here and there–his faculties for the moment were\nconcentrated on traversing the bathroom silently.  He reached the\nfarther door, crouched there, peered through the crack–and the old\nwhimsical smile flickered across his lips again.",
        "The Palais-Metropole was high class and exclusive, and the Weasel\nfor once looked quite the gentleman, and, for all his sharp, ferret\nface, not entirely out of keeping with his surroundings–else he\nwould never have got farther than the lobby.  The other was a short,\nthickset, heavy-jowled man, with a great shock of sandy hair, and\nsmall black eyes that looked furtively out from overhanging, bushy\neyebrows.",
        "“Well,” Hamvert was saying, “the details are your concern.  What I\nwant is results.  We won’t waste time.  You’re to be back here by\ndaylight–only see that there’s no come-back.”",
        "“Leave it to me!” returned the Weasel, with assurance.  “How’s dere\ngoin’ ter be any come-back?  Mittel keeps it in his safe, don’t he?\nWell, gentlemen’s houses has been robbed before–an’ dis job’ll be a\ngood one.  De geographfy stunt youse wants gets pinched wid de rest,\ndat’s all.  It disappears–see?  Who’s ter know youse gets yer claws\non it?  It’s just lost in de shuffle.”",
        "“Right!” agreed Hamvert briskly–and from his inside pocket produced\na package of crisp new bills, yellow-backs, and evidently of large\ndenominations.  “Half down and half on delivery–that’s our deal.”",
        "“Dat’s wot!” assented the Weasel curtly.",
        "Hamvert began to count the bills.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s hand stole into his pocket, and came out with his\nhandkerchief and the thin metal insignia case.  From the latter,\nwith its little pair of tweezers, he took out one of the adhesive\ngray seals.  His eyes warily on the two men, he dropped the seal on\nhis handkerchief, restored the thin metal case to his pocket–and in\nits stead the blue-black ugly muzzle of his automatic peeped from\nbetween his fingers.",
        "“Five thousand down,” said Hamvert, pushing a pile of notes across\nthe table, and tucking the remainder back into his pocket; “and the\nother five’s here for you when you get back with the map.\nOrdinarily, I wouldn’t pay a penny in advance, but since you want it\nthat way and the map’s no good to you while the rest of the long\ngreen is, I–”  He swallowed his words with a startled gulp,\nclutched hastily at the money on the table, and began to struggle up\nfrom his chair to his feet.",
        "With a swift, noiseless side-step through the open door, Jimmie Dale\nwas standing in the room.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s tones were conversational.  “Don’t get up,” said\nJimmie Dale coolly.  “And take your hand off that money!”",
        "The Weasel, whose back had been to the door, squirmed around in his\nchair–and in his turn stared into the muzzle of Jimmie Dale’s\nrevolver, while his jaw dropped and sagged.",
        "“Good-evening, Weasel,” observed Jimmie Dale casually.  “I seem to\nbe in luck to-night.  I got into that room next door, but an empty\nroom is slim picking.  And then it seemed to me I heard some one in\nhere mention five thousand dollars twice, which makes ten thousand,\nand which happens to be just exactly the sum I need at the present\nmoment–if I can’t get any more!  I haven’t the honour of your\nwealthy friend’s acquaintance, but I am really charmed to meet him.\nYou–er–understand, both of you, that the slightest sound might\nprove extremely embarrassing.”",
        "Hamvert’s face was white, and he stirred uneasily in his chair; but\ninto the Weasel’s face, the first shock of surprised dismay past,\ncame a dull, angry red, and into the eyes a vicious gleam–and\nsuddenly he laughed shortly.",
        "“Why, youse damned fool,” jeered the Weasel, “d’youse t’ink youse\ncan get away wid dat!  Say, take it from me, youse are a piker!\nSay, youse make me tired.  Wot d’youse t’ink youse are?  D’youse\nt’ink dis is a tee-ayter, an’ dat youse are a cheap-skate actor\nstrollin’ acrost de stage?  Aw, beat it, youse make me sick!  Why,\nsay, youse pinch dat money, an’ youse have got de same chanst of\ngettin’ outer dis hotel as a guy has of breakin’ outer Sing Sing!\nBy de time youse gets five feet from de door of dis room we has de\nwhole works on yer neck.”",
        "“Do you think so, Weasel?” inquired Jimmie Dale politely.  He\ncarried his handkerchief to his mouth to cloak a cough–and his\ntongue touched the adhesive side of the little diamond-shaped gray\nseal.  Hand and handkerchief came back to the table, and Jimmie Dale\nleaned his weight carelessly upon it, while the automatic in his\nright hand still covered the two men.  “Do you think so, Weasel?” he\nrepeated softly.  “Well, perhaps you are right; and yet; somehow, I\nam inclined to disagree with you.  Let me see, Weasel–it was\nTuesday night, two nights ago; wasn’t it, that a trifling break in\nMaiden Lane at Thorold and Sons disturbed the police?  It was a\nthree-year job for even a first offender, ten for one already on\nnodding terms with the police and fifteen to twenty for–well, say,\nfor a man like you, Weasel–IF HE WERE CAUGHT!  Am I making myself\nquite plain?”",
        "The colour in the Weasel’s cheeks faded a little–his eyes were\nholding in sudden fascination upon Jimmie Dale.",
        "“I see that I am,” observed Jimmie Dale pleasantly.  “I said, ’if he\nwere caught,’ you will remember.  I am going to leave this room in a\nmoment, Weasel, and leave it entirely to your discretion as to\nwhether you will think it wise or not to stir from that chair for\nten minutes after I shut the door.  And now\"–Jimmie Dale\nnonchalantly replaced his handkerchief in his pocket, nonchalantly\nfollowed it with the banknotes which he picked up from the table–\nand smiled.",
        "With a gasp, both men had strained forward, and were staring, wild-\neyed, at the gray seal stuck between them on the tabletop.",
        "“The Gray Seal!” whispered the Weasel, and his tongue circled his\nlips.",
        "Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders.",
        "“That WAS a bit theatrical, Weasel,” he said apologetically; “and\nyet not wholly unnecessary.  You will recall Stangeist, The Mope,\nAustralian Ike, and Clarie Deane, and can draw your own inference as\nto what might happen in the Thorold affair if you should be so ill-\nadvised as to force my hand.  Permit me\"–the slim, deft fingers,\nlike a streak of lightning, were inside Hamvert’s coat pocket and\nout again with the remainder of the banknotes–and Jimmie Dale was\nbacking for the door–not the door of the bathroom by which he had\nentered, but the door of the room itself that opened on the\ncorridor.  There he stopped, and his hand swept around behind his\nback and turned the key in the locked door.  He nodded at the two\nmen, whose faces were working with incongruously mingled expressions\nof impotent rage, bewilderment, fear, and fury–and opened the door\na little.  “Ten minutes, Weasel,” he said gently.  “I trust you will\nnot have to use heroic measures to restrain your friend for that\nlength of time, though if it is necessary I should advise you for\nyour own sake to resort almost–to murder.  I wish you good evening,\ngentlemen.”",
        "The door opened farther; Jimmie Dale, still facing inward, slipped\nbetween it and the jamb, whipped the mask from his face, closed the\ndoor softly, stepped briskly but without any appearance of haste\nalong the corridor to the stairs, descended the stairs, mingled with\na crowd in the lobby for an instant, walked, seemingly a part of it,\nwith a group of ladies and gentlemen down the hall to the side\nentrance, passed out–and a moment later, after drawing on a linen\ndust coat which he took from under the seat, and exchanging his hat\nfor a tweed cap, the car glided from the curb and was lost in a\npress of traffic around the corner.",
        "Jimmie Dale laughed a little harshly to himself.  So far, so good–\nbut the game was not ended yet for all the crackle of the crisp\nnotes in his pocket.  There was still the map, still the robbery at\nMittel’s house–the ten-thousand-dollar “theft” would not in any way\nchange that, and it was a question of time now to forestall any move\nthe Weasel might make.",
        "Through the city Jimmie Dale alternately dodged, spurted, and\ndragged his way, fuming with impatience; but once out on the country\nroads and headed toward New Rochelle, the big machine, speed limits\nthrown to the winds, roared through the night–a gray streak of road\njumping under the powerful lamps; a village, a town, a cluster of\nlights flashing by him, the steady purr of his sixty-horse-power\nengines; the gray thread of open road again.",
        "It was just eleven o’clock when Jimmie Dale, the road to himself for\nthe moment at a spot a little beyond New Rochelle, extinguished his\nlights, and very carefully ran his car off the road, backing it in\nbehind a small clump of trees.  He tossed the linen dust coat back\ninto the car, and set off toward where, a little distance away, the\nslap of waves from the stiff breeze that was blowing indicated the\nshore line of the Sound.  There was no moon, and, while it was not\nparticularly dark, objects and surroundings at best were blurred and\nindistinct; but that, after all, was a matter of little concern to\nJimmie Dale–the first house beyond was Mittel’s.  He reached the\nwater’s edge and kept along the shore.  There should be a little\nwharf, she had said.  Yes; there it was–and there, too, was a gleam\nof light from the house itself.",
        "Jimmie Dale began to make an accurate mental note of his\nsurroundings.  From the little wharf on which he now stood, a path\nled straight to the house, bisecting what appeared to be a lawn,\ntrees to the right, the house to the left.  At the wharf, beside\nhim, two motor boats were moored, one on each side.  Jimmie Dale\nglanced at them, and, suddenly attracted by the familiar appearance\nof one, inspected it a little more closely.  His momentarily\nawakened interest passed as he nodded his head.  It had caught his\nattention, that was all–it was the same type and design, quite a\npopular make, of which there were hundreds around New York, as the\none he had bought that year as a tender for his yacht.",
        "He moved forward now toward the house, the rear of which faced him–\nthe light that flooded the lawn came from a side window.  Jimmie\nDale was figuring the time and distance from New York as he crept\ncautiously along.  How quickly could the Weasel make the journey?\nThe Weasel would undoubtedly come, and if there was a convenient\ntrain it might prove a close race–but in his own favour was the\nfact that it would probably take the Weasel quite some little time\nto recover his equilibrium from his encounter with the Gray Seal in\nthe Palais-Metropole, also the further fact that, from the Weasel’s\nviewpoint, there was no desperate need of haste.  Jimmie Dale\ncrossed the lawn, and edged along in the shadows of the house to\nwhere the light streamed out from what now proved to be open French\nwindows.  It was a fair presumption that he would have an hour to\nthe good on the Weasel.",
        "The sill was little more than a couple of feet from the ground, and,\nfrom a crouched position on his knees below the window, Jimmie Dale\nraised himself slowly and peered guardedly inside.  The room was\nempty.  He listened a moment–the black silk mask was on his face\nagain–and with a quick, agile, silent spring he was in the room.",
        "And then, in the centre of the room, Jimmie Dale stood motionless,\nstaring around him, an expression, ironical, sardonic, creeping into\nhis face.  THE ROBBERY HAD ALREADY BEEN COMMITTED!  At the lower end\nof the room everything was in confusion; the door of a safe swung\nwide, the drawers of a desk had been wrenched out, even a liqueur\nstand, on which were well-filled decanters, had been broken open,\nand the contents of safe and desk, the thief’s discards as it were,\nlittered the floor in all directions.",
        "For an instant Jimmie Dale, his eyes narrowed ominously, surveyed\nthe scene; then, with a sort of professional instinct aroused, he\nstepped forward to examine the safe–and suddenly darted behind the\ndesk instead.  Steps sounded in the hall.  The door opened–a voice\nreached him:",
        "“The master said I was to shut the windows, and I haven’t dast to go\nin.  And he’ll be back with the police in a minute now.  Come on in\nwith me, Minnie.”",
        "“Lord!” exclaimed another voice.  “Ain’t it a good thing the missus\nis away.  She’d have highsteericks!”",
        "Steps came somewhat hesitantly across the floor–from behind the\ndesk, Jimmie Dale could see that it was a maid, accompanied by a\nbig, rawboned woman, sleeves rolled to the elbows over brawny arms,\npresumably the Mittels’ cook.",
        "The maid closed the French windows, there were no others in the\nroom, and bolted them; and, having gained a little confidence, gazed\nabout her.",
        "“My, but wasn’t he cute!” she ejaculated.”  Cut the telephone wires,\nhe did.  And ain’t he made an awful mess!  But the master said we\nwasn’t to touch nothing till the police saw it.”",
        "“And to think of it happening in OUR house!” observed the cook\nheavily, her hands on her hips, her arms akimbo.  “It’ll all be in\nthe papers, and mabbe they’ll put our pictures in, too.”",
        "“I won’t get over it as long as I live!” declared the maid.  “The\nyell Mr. Mittel gave when he came downstairs and put his head in\nhere, and then him shouting and using the most terrible language\ninto the telephone, and then finding the wires cut.  And me\nfollowing him downstairs half dead with fright.  And he shouts at\nme.  ’Bella,’ he shouts, ’shut those windows, but don’t you touch a\nthing in that room.  I’m going for the police.’  And then he rushes\nout of the house.”",
        "“I was going to bed,” said the cook, picking up her cue for what was\nprobably the twentieth rehearsal of the scene, “when I heard Mr.\nMittel yell, and–Lord, Bella, there he is now!”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s hands clenched.  He, too, had caught the scuffle of\nfootsteps, those of three or four men at least, on the front porch.\nThere was one way, only one, of escape–through the French windows!\nIt was a matter of seconds only before Mittel, with the police at\nhis heels, would be in the room–and Jimmie Dale sprang to his feet.\nThere was a wild scream of terror from the maid, echoed by another\nfrom the cook–and, still screaming, both women fled for the door.",
        "“Mr. Mittel!  Mr. Mittel!” shrieked the maid–she had flung herself\nout into the hall.  “He’s–he’s back again!”",
        "Jimmie Dale was at the French windows, tearing at the bolts.  They\nstuck.  Shouts came from the front entryway.  He wrenched viciously\nat the fastenings.  They gave now.  The windows flew open.  He\nglanced over his shoulder.  A man, Mittel presumably, since he was\nthe only one not in uniform, was springing into the room.  There was\na blur of forms and brass buttons behind Mittel–and Jimmie Dale\nleaped to the lawn, speeding across it like a deer.",
        "But quick as he ran, Jimmie Dale’s brain was quicker, pointing the\nsingle chance that seemed open to him.  The motor boat!  It seemed\nlike a God-given piece of luck that he had noticed it was like his\nown; there would be no blind, and that meant fatal, blunders in the\ndark over its mechanism, and he could start it up in a moment–just\nthe time to cast her off, that was all he needed.",
        "The shouts swelled behind him.  Jimmie Dale was running for his\nlife.  He flung a glance backward.  One form–Mittel, he was\ncertain–was perhaps a hundred yards in the rear.  The others were\njust emerging from the French windows–grotesque, leaping things\nthey looked, in the light that streamed out behind them from the\nroom.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s feet pounded the planking of the wharf.  He stooped\nand snatched at the mooring line.  Mittel was almost at the wharf.\nIt seemed an age, a year to Jimmie Dale before the line was clear.\nShouts rang still louder across the lawn–the police, racing in a\npack, were more than halfway from the house.  He flung the line into\nthe boat, sprang in after it–and Mittel, looming over him, grasped\nat the boat’s gunwhale.",
        "Both men were panting from their exertions.",
        "“Let go!” snarled Jimmie Dale between clenched teeth.",
        "Mittel’s answer was a hoarse, gasping shout to the police to hurry–\nand then Mittel reeled back, measuring his length upon the wharf\nfrom a blow with a boat hook full across the face, driven with a\nsudden, untamed savagery that seemed for the moment to have mastered\nJimmie Dale.",
        "There was no time–not a second–not the fraction of a second.\nDesperately, frantically he shoved the boat clear of the wharf.\nOnce–twice–three times he turned the engine over without success–\nand then the boat leaped forward.  Jimmie Dale snatched the mask\nfrom his face, and jumped for the steering wheel.  The police were\nrushing out along the wharf.  He could just faintly discern Mittel\nnow–the man was staggering about, his hands clapped to his face.  A\nperemptory order to halt, coupled with a threat to fire, rang out\nsharply–and Jimmie Dale flung himself flat in the bottom of the\nboat.  The wharf edge seemed to open in little, crackling jets of\nflame, came the roar of reports like a miniature battery in action,\nthen the FLOP, FLOP, FLOP, as the lead tore up the water around him,\nthe duller thud as a bullet buried its nose in the boat’s side, and\nthe curious rip and squeak as a splinter flew.  Then Mittel’s voice,\nhigh-pitched, as though in pain:",
        "“Can’t any of you run a motor boat?  He’s got me bad, I’m afraid.\nThat other one there is twice as fast.”",
        "“Sure!” another voice responded promptly.  “And if that’s right,\nhe’s run his head into a trap.  Cast loose, there, MacVeay, and pile\nin, all of you!  You go back to the house, Mr. Mittel, and fix\nyourself up.  We’ll get him!”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s lips thinned.  It was true!  If the other boat had any\nspeed at all, it was only a question of time before he would be\novertaken.  The only point at issue was how much time.  It was dark–\nthat was in his favour–but it was not so dark but that a boat\ncould be distinguished on the water for quite a distance, for a\nlonger distance than he could hope to put between them.  There was\nno chance of eluding the police that way!  The keen, facile brain\nthat had saved the Gray Seal a hundred times before was weaving,\nplanning, discarding, eliminating, scheming a way out–with death,\nruin, disaster the price of failure.  His eyes swept the dim,\nirregular outline of the shore.  To his right, in the opposite\ndirection from where he had left his car, and perhaps a mile ahead,\nas well as he could judge, the land seemed to run out into a point.\nJimmie Dale headed for it instantly.  If he could reach it with a\nlittle lead to the good, there was a chance!  It would take, say,\nsix minutes, granting the boat a speed of ten miles an hour–and she\ncould do that.  The others could hardly overtake him in that time–\nthey hadn’t got started yet.  He could hear them still shouting and\ntalking at the wharf.  And Mittel’s “twice as fast” was undoubtedly\nan exaggeration, anyhow.",
        "A minute more passed, another–and then, astern, Jimmie Dale caught\nthe racket from the exhaust of a high-powered engine, and a white\nstreak seemed to shoot out upon the surface of the water from where,\nobscured now, he placed the wharf.  A quarter-mile lead, roughly\nfour hundred yards; yes, he had as much as that–but that, too, was\nvery little.",
        "He bent over his engine, coaxing it, nursing it to its highest\nefficiency; his eyes strained now upon the point ahead, now upon his\npursuers behind.  He was running with the wind, thank Heaven! or the\nsmall boat would have had a further handicap–it was rolling up\nquite a sea.",
        "The steering gear, he found, was corded along the side of the boat,\npermitting its manipulation from almost any position, and, abruptly\nnow, Jimmie Dale left the engine to rummage through the little\nlocker in the stern of the boat.  But as he rummaged, his eyes held\nspeculatively on the boat astern.  She was gaining unquestionably,\nsteadily, but not as fast as he had feared.  He would still have a\nhundred yards’ lead, at least, abreast the point–and, he was\nsmiling grimly now, a hundred yards there meant life to the Gray\nSeal!  The locker was full of a heterogeneous collection of odds and\nends–a suit of oilskins, tools, tins, and cans of various sizes and\ndescriptions.  Jimmie Dale emptied the contents, some sort of\npowder, of a small, round tin box overboard, and from his pocket\ntook out the banknotes, crammed them into the box, crammed his watch\nin on top of them, and screwed the cover on tightly.  His fingers\nwere flying now.  A long strip torn from the trousers’ leg of the\noilskins was wrapped again and again around the box–and the box was\nstuffed into his pocket.",
        "The flash of a revolver shot cut the blackness behind him, then\nanother, and another.  They were firing in a continuous stream\nagain.  It was fairly long range, but there was always the chance of\na stray bullet finding its mark.  Jimmie Dale, crouching low, made\nhis way to the bow of the boat again.",
        "The point was looming almost abreast now.  He edged in nearer, to\nhug it as closely as he dared risk the depth of the water.  Behind,\nremorselessly, the other boat was steadily closing the gap; and the\nshots were not all wild–one struck, with a curious singing sound,\non some piece of metal a foot from his elbow.  Closer to the shore,\nrunning now parallel with the head of the point, Jimmie Dale again\nedged in the boat, his jaws, clamped, working in little twitches.",
        "And then suddenly, with a swift, appraising glance behind him, he\nswerved the boat from her course and headed for the shore–not\ndirectly, but diagonally across the little bay that, on the farther\nside of the point, had now opened out before him.  He was close in\nwith the edge of the point, ten yards from it, sweeping past it–the\npoint itself came between the two boats, hiding them from each\nother–and Jimmie Dale, with a long spring, dove from the boat’s\nside to the water.",
        "The momentum from the boat as he sank robbed him for an instant of\nall control over himself, and he twisted, doubled up, and rolled\nover and over beneath the water–but the next moment his head was\nabove the surface again, and he was striking out swiftly for the\nshore.  It was only a few yards–but in a few SECONDS the pursuing\nboat, too, would have rounded the point.  His feet touched bottom.\nIt was haste now, nothing else, that counted.  The drum of the\nracing engines, the crackling roar of the exhaust from the oncoming\nboat was in his ears.  He flung himself upon the shore and down\nbehind a rock.  Around the point, past him, tore the police boat,\ndark forms standing clustered in the bow–and then a sudden shout:",
        "“There she is!  See her?  She’s heading into the bay for the shore!”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s lips relaxed.  There was no doubt that they had\nsighted their quarry again–a perfect fusillade of revolver shots\ndirected at the now empty boat was quite sufficient proof of that!\nWith something that was almost a chuckle, Jimmie Dale straightened\nup from behind the rock and began to run back along the shore.  The\nlittle motor boat would have grounded long before they overtook her,\nand, thinking naturally enough, that he had leaped ashore from her,\nthey would go thrashing through the woods and fields searching for\nhim!",
        "It was a longer way back by the shore, a good deal longer; now over\nrough, rocky stretches where he stumbled in the darkness, now\nthrough marshy, sodden ground where he sank as in a quagmire time\nand again over his ankles.  It was even longer than he had counted\non, and time, with the Weasel on one hand and the return of the\npolice on the other, was a factor to be reckoned with again, as, a\nhalf hour later, Jimmie Dale stole across the lawn of Mittel’s house\nfor the second time that night, and for the second time crouched\nbeneath the open French windows.",
        "Masked again, the water still dripping from what were once\nimmaculate evening clothes but which now sagged limply about him,\nhis collar a pasty string around his neck, the mud and dirt splashed\nto his knees, Jimmie Dale was a disreputable and incongruous-looking\nobject as he crouched there, shivering uncomfortably from his\nimmersion in spite of his exertions.  Inside the room, Mittel passed\nthe windows, pacing the floor, one side of his face badly cut and\nbruised from the blow with the boat hook–and as he passed, his back\nturned for an instant, Jimmie Dale stepped into the room.",
        "Mittel whirled at the sound, and, with a suppressed cry,\ninstinctively drew back–Jimmie Dale’s automatic was dangling\ncarelessly in his right hand.",
        "“I am afraid I am a trifle melodramatic,” observed Jimmie Dale\napologetically, surveying his own bedraggled person; “but I assure\nyou it is neither intentional nor for effect.  As it is, I was\nafraid I would be late.  Pardon me if I take the liberty of helping\nmyself; one gets a chill in wet clothes so easily\"–he passed to the\nliqueur stand, poured out a generous portion from one of the\ndecanters, and tossed it off.",
        "Mittel neither spoke nor moved.  Stupefaction, surprise, and a very\nobvious regard for Jimmie Dale’s revolver mingled themselves in a\nhelpless expression on his face.",
        "Jimmie Dale set down his glass and pointed to a chair in front of\nthe desk.",
        "“Sit down, Mr. Mittel,” he invited pleasantly.  “It will be quite\napparent to you that I have not time to prolong our interview\nunnecessarily, in view of the possible return of the police at any\nmoment, but you might as well be comfortable.  You will pardon me\nagain if I take another liberty\"–he crossed the room, turned the\nkey in the lock of the door leading into the hall, and returned to\nthe desk.  “Sit down, Mr. Mittel!” he repeated, a sudden rasp in his\nvoice.",
        "Mittel, none too graciously, now seated himself.",
        "“Look here, my fine fellow,” he burst out, “you’re carrying things\nwith a pretty high hand, aren’t you?  You seem to have eluded the\npolice for the moment, somehow, but let me tell you I–”",
        "“No,” interrupted Jimmie Dale softly, “let ME tell you–all there is\nto be told.”  He leaned over the desk and stared rudely at the\nbruise on Mittel’s face.  “Rather a nasty crack, that,” he remarked.",
        "Mittel’s fists clenched, and an angry flush swept his cheeks.",
        "“I’d have made it a good deal harder,” said Jimmie Dale, with sudden\ninsolence, “if I hadn’t been afraid of putting you out of business\nand so precluding the possibility of this little meeting.  Now\nthen\"–the revolver swung upward and held steadily on a line with\nMittel’s eyes–” I’ll trouble you for the diagram of that Alaskan\nclaim that belongs to Mrs. Michael Breen!”",
        "Mittel, staring fascinated into the little, round, black muzzle of\nthe automatic, edged back in his chair.",
        "So–so that’s what you’re after, is it?” he jerked out.  “Well\"–he\nlaughed unnaturally and waved his hand at the disarray of the room–\n\"it’s been stolen already.”",
        "“I know that,” said Jimmie Dale grimly.  “By–YOU!”",
        "“Me!”  Mittel started up in his chair, a whiteness creeping into his\nface.  “Me!  I–I–”",
        "“Sit down!”  Jimmie Dale’s voice rang out ominously cold.  “I\nhaven’t any time to spare.  You can appreciate that.  But even if\nthe police return before that map is in my possession, they will\nstill be TOO LATE as far as you are concerned.  Do you understand?\nFurthermore, if I am caught–you are ruined.  Let me make it quite\nplain that I know the details of your little game.  You are a curb\nbroker, Mr. Mittel–ostensibly.  In reality, you run what is nothing\nbetter than an exceedingly profitable bucket shop.  The Weasel has\nbeen a customer and also a stool for you for years.  How Hamvert met\nthe Weasel is unimportant–he came East with the intention of\ngetting in touch with a slick crook to help him–the Weasel is the\ncoincidence, that is all.  I quite understand that you have never\nmet Hamvert, nor Hamvert you, nor that Hamvert was aware that you\nand the Weasel had anything to do with one another and were playing\nin together–but that equally is unimportant.  When Hamvert engaged\nthe Weasel for ten thousand dollars to get the map from you for him,\nthe Weasel chose the line of least resistance.  He KNEW you, and\napproached you with an offer to split the money in return for the\nmap.  It was not a question of your accepting his offer–it was\nsimply a matter of how you could do it and still protect yourself.\nThe Weasel was well qualified to point the way–a fake robbery of\nyour house would answer the purpose admirably–you could not be held\neither legally or morally responsible for a document that was\nplaced, unsolicited by you, in your possession, if it were stolen\nfrom you.”",
        "Mittel’s face was ashen, colourless.  His hands were opening and\nshutting with nervous twitches on the top of the desk.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s lips curled.",
        "“But\"–Jimmie Dale was clipping off his words now viciously–\n\"neither you nor the Weasel were willing to trust the other\nimplicitly–perhaps you know each other too well.  You were\nunwilling to turn over the map until you had received your share of\nthe money, and you were equally unwilling to turn it over until you\nwere SAFE; that is, until you had engineered your fake robbery even\nto the point of notifying the police that it had been committed; the\nWeasel, on the other hand, had some scruples about parting with any\nof the money without getting the map in one hand before he let go of\nthe banknotes with the other.  It was very simply arranged, however,\nand to your mutual satisfaction.  While you robbed your own house\nthis evening, he was to get half the money in advance from Hamvert,\ngiving Hamvert to understand that HE had planned to commit the\nrobbery himself to-night.  He was to come out here then, receive the\nmap from you in exchange for your share of the money, return to\nHamvert with the map, and receive in turn his own share.  I might\nsay that Hamvert actually paid down the advance–and it was perhaps\nunfortunate for you that you paid such scrupulous attention to\ndetails as to cut your own telephone wires!  I had not, of course,\nan exact knowledge of the hour or minute in which you proposed to\nstage your little play here.  The object of my first visit a little\nwhile ago was to forestall your turning the diagram over to the\nWeasel.  Circumstances favoured you for the moment.  I am back\nagain, however, for the same purpose–the map!”",
        "Mittel, in a cowed way, was huddled back in his chair.  He smiled\nmiserably at Jimmie Dale.",
        "“QUICK!”  Jimmie Dale flung out the word in a sharp, peremptory\nbark.  “Do you need to be told that the CARTRIDGES are dry?”",
        "Mittel’s hand, trembling, went into his pocket and produced an\nenvelope.",
        "“Open it!” commanded Jimmie Dale.  “And lay it on the desk, so that\nI can read it–I am too wet to touch it.”",
        "Mittel obeyed–like a dog that has been whipped.",
        "A glance at the paper, and Jimmie Dale’s eyes lifted again–to sweep\nthe floor of the room.  He pointed to a pile of books and documents\nin one corner that had been thrown out of the safe.",
        "“Go over there and pick up that check book!” he ordered tersely.",
        "“What for?” Mittel made feeble protest.",
        "“Never mind what for!” snapped Jimmie Dale.  “Go and get it–and\nHURRY!",
        "Once more Mittel obeyed–and dropped the book hesitantly on the\ndesk.",
        "Jimmie Dale stared silently, insolently, contemptuously at the\nother.",
        "Mittel stirred uneasily, sat down, shifted his feet, and his fingers\nfumbled aimlessly over the top of the desk.",
        "“Compared with you,” said Jimmie Dale, in a low voice, the Weasel,\nay, and Hamvert, too, crooks though they are, are gentlemen!\nMichael Breen, as he died, told his wife to take that paper to some\none she could trust, who would help her and tell her what to do;\nand, knowing no one to go to, but because she scrubbed your floors\nand therefore thought you were a fine gentleman, she came timidly to\nyou, and trusted you–you cur!”",
        "Jimmie Dale laughed suddenly–not pleasantly.  Mittel shivered.",
        "“Hamvert and Breen were partners out there in Alaska when Breen\nfirst went out,” said Jimmie Dale slowly, pulling the tin can\nwrapped in oilskin from his pocket.  “Hamvert swindled Breen out of\nthe one strike he made, and Mrs. Breen and her little girl back here\nwere reduced to poverty.  The amount of that swindle was, I\nunderstand, fifteen thousand dollars.  I have ten of it here,\ncontributed by the Weasel and Hamvert; and you will, I think,\nrecognise therein a certain element of poetic justice–but I am\nstill short five thousand dollars.”",
        "Jimmie Dale removed the cover from the tin can.  Mittel gazed at the\ncontents numbly.",
        "“You perhaps did not hear me?” prompted Jimmie Dale coldly.  “I am\nstill short five thousand dollars.”",
        "Mittel circled his lips with the tip of his tongue.",
        "“What do you want?” he whispered hoarsely.",
        "“The balance of the amount.”  There was an ominous quiet in Jimmie\nDale’s voice.  “A check payable to Mrs. Michael Breen for five\nthousand dollars.”",
        "“I–I haven’t got that much in the bank,” Mittel fenced, stammering.",
        "“No?  Then I should advise you to see that you have by ten o’clock\nto-morrow morning!” returned Jimmie Dale curtly.  “Make out that\ncheck!”",
        "Mittel hesitated.  The revolver edged insistently a little farther\nacross the desk–and Mittel, picking up a pen, wrote feverishly.  He\ntore the check from its stub, and, with a snarl, pushed it toward\nJimmie Dale.",
        "“Fold it!” instructed Jimmie Dale, in the same curt tones.  “And\nfold that diagram with it.  Put them both in this box.  Thank you!\"\nHe wrapped the oilskin around the box again, and returned the box to\nhis pocket.  And again with that insolent, contemptuous stare, he\nsurveyed the man at the desk–then he backed to the French windows.\n\"It might be as well to remind you, Mittel,” he cautioned sternly,\n\"that if for any reason this check is not honoured, whether through\nlack of funds or an attempt by you to stop payment, you’ll be in a\ncell in the Tombs to-morrow for this night’s work–that is quite\nunderstood, isn’t it?”",
        "Mittel was on his feet–sweat glistened on his forehead.",
        "“My God!” he cried out shrilly.  “Who are you?”",
        "And Jimmie Dale smiled and stepped out on the lawn.",
        "“Ask the Weasel,” said Jimmie Dale–and the next instant, lost in\nthe shadows of the house, was running for his car.",
        "DEATH TO THE GRAY SEAL!\"–through the underworld, in dens and dives\nthat sheltered from the law the vultures that preyed upon society,\nprompted by self-fear, by secret dread, by reason of their very\ninability to carry out their purpose, the whispered sentence grew\ndaily more venomous, more insistent.  THE GRAY SEAL, DEAD OR ALIVE–\nBUT THE GRAY SEAL!”  It was the “standing orders” of the police.\nRailed at by a populace who angrily demanded at its hands this\ncriminal of criminals, mocked at and threatened by a virulent press,\nstung to madness by the knowledge of its own impotence, flaunted\nimpudently to its face by this mysterious Gray Seal to whose door\nthe law laid a hundred crimes, for whom the bars of a death cell in\nSing Sing was the certain goal could he but be caught, the police,\nto a man, was like an uncaged beast that, flicked to the raw by some\nunseen assailant and murderous in its fury, was crouched to strike.\nGrim paradox–a common bond that linked the hands of the law with\nthose that outraged it!",
        "Death to the Gray Seal!  Was it, at last, the beginning of the end?\nJimmie Dale, as Larry the Bat, unkempt, disreputable in appearance,\nsupposed dope fiend, a figure familiar to every denizen below the\ndead line, skulked along the narrow, ill-lighted street of the East\nSide that, on the corner ahead, boasted the notorious resort to\nwhich Bristol Bob had paid the doubtful, if appropriate, compliment\nof giving his name.  From under the rim of his battered hat, Jimmie\nDale’s eyes, veiled by half-closed, well-simulated drug-laden lids,\nmissed no detail either of his surroundings or pertaining to the\npassers-by.  Though already late in the evening, half-naked children\nplayed in the gutters; hawkers of multitudinous commodities cried\ntheir wares under gasoline banjo torches affixed to their pushcarts;\nshawled women of half a dozen races, and men equally cosmopolitan,\nloitered at the curb, or blocked the pavement, or brushed by him.\nNow a man passed him, flinging a greeting from the corner of his\nmouth; now another, always without movement of the lips–and Jimmie\nDale answered them–from the corner of his mouth.",
        "But while his eyes were alert, his mind was only subconsciously\nattune to his surroundings.  Was it indeed the beginning of the end?\nSome day, he had told himself often enough, the end must come.  Was\nit coming now, surely, with a sort of grim implacability–when it was\ntoo late to escape!  Slowly, but inexorably, even his personal\nfreedom of action was narrowing, being limited, and, ironically\nenough, through the very conditions he had himself created as an\navenue of escape.",
        "It was not only the police now; it was, far more to be feared, the\nunderworld as well.  In the old days, the role of Larry the Bat had\nbeen assumed at intervals, at his own discretion, when, in a corner,\nhe had no other way of escape; now it was forced upon him almost\ndaily.  The character of Larry the Bat could no longer be discarded\nat will.  He had flung down the gauntlet to the underworld when, as\nthe Gray Seal, he had closed the prison doors behind Stangeist, The\nMope, Australian Ike, and Clarie Deane, and the underworld had\npicked the gauntlet up.  Betrayed, as they believed, by the one who,\nthough unknown to them; they had counted the greatest among\nthemselves, and each one fearful that his own betrayal might come\nnext, every crook, every thug in the Bad Lands now eyed his oldest\npal with suspicion and distrust, and each was a self-constituted\nsleuth, with the prod of self-preservation behind him, sworn to the\naccomplishment of that unhallowed slogan–death to the Gray Seal.\nAlmost daily now he must show himself as Larry the Bat in some\ngathering of the underworld–a prolonged absence from his haunts was\nnot merely to invite certain suspicion, where all were suspicious of\neach other, it was to invite certain disaster.  He had now either to\ncarry the role like a little old man of the sea upon his back, or\nrenounce it forever.  And the latter course he dared not even\nconsider–the Sanctuary was still the Sanctuary, and the role of\nLarry the Bat was still a refuge, the trump card in the lone hand he\nplayed.",
        "He reached the corner, pushed open the door of Bristol Bob’s, and\nshuffled in.  The place was a glare of light, a hideous riot of\nnoise.  On a polished section of the floor in the centre, a turkey\ntrot was in full swing; laughter and shouting vied raucously with an\nimpossible orchestra.",
        "Jimmie Dale slowly made the circuit of the room past the tables,\nthat, ranged around the sides, were packed with occupants who\nthumped their glasses in tempo with the music and clamoured at the\nrushing waiters for replenishment.  A dozen, two dozen, men and\nwomen greeted him.  Jimmie Dale indifferently returned their\nsalutes.  What a galaxy of crooks–the cream of the underworld!  His\neyes, under half-closed lids, swept the faces–lags, dips, gatmen,\nyeggs, mob stormers, murderers, petty sneak thieves, stalls,\nhangers-on–they were all there.  He knew them all; he was known to\nall.",
        "He shuffled on to the far end of the room, his leer a little\narrogant, a certain arrogance, too, in the tilt of his battered hat.\nHe also was quite a celebrity in that gathering–Larry the Bat was\nof the aristocracy and the elite of gangland.  Well, the show was\nover; he had stalked across the stage, performed for his audience–\nand in another hour now, free until he must repeat the same\nperformance the next day in some other equally notorious dive, he\nwould be sitting in for a rubber of bridge at that most exclusive of\nall clubs, the St. James, where none might enter save only those\nwhose names were vouched for in the highest and most select circles,\nand where for partners he would possibly have a justice of the\nsupreme court, or mayhap an eminent divine!  He looked suddenly\naround him, as though startled.  It always startled him, that\ncomparison.  There was something too stupendous to be simply\nironical in the incongruity of it.  If–if he were ever run to\nearth!",
        "His eyes met those of a heavy-built, coarse-featured man, the chewed\nend of a cigar in his mouth, who stepped from behind the bar,\ncarrying a tin tray with two full glasses upon it.  It was Bristol\nBob, ex-pugilist, the proprietor.",
        "“How’re you, Larry?” grunted the man, with what he meant to be a\nsmile.",
        "Jimmie Dale was standing in the doorway of a passage that prefaced a\nrear exit to the lane.  He moved aside to allow the other to pass.",
        "“’Ello, Bristol,” he returned dispassionately.",
        "Bristol Bob went on along down the passage, and Jimmie Dale shuffled\nslowly after him.  He had intended to leave the place by the rear\ndoor–it obviated the possibility of an undesirable acquaintance\njoining company with him if he went out by the main entrance.  But\nnow his eyes were fixed on the proprietor’s back with a sort of\nspeculative curiosity.  There was a private room off the passage,\nwith a window on the lane; but they must be favoured customers\nindeed that Bristol Bob would condescend to serve personally–any\none who knew Bristol Bob knew that.",
        "Jimmie Dale slowed his shuffling gait, then quickened it again.\nBristol Bob opened the door and passed into the private room–the\ndoor was just closing as Jimmie Dale shuffled by.  He had had only a\nglance inside–but it was enough.  They were favoured customers\nindeed!  It was no wonder that Bristol Bob himself was on the job!\nTwo men were in the room: Lannigan of headquarters, rated the\nsmartest plain-clothes man in the country–and, across the table\nfrom Lannigan, Whitey Mack, as clever, finished and daring a crook\nas was to be found in the Bad Lands, whose particular “line” was\ndiamonds, or, in the vernacular of his ilk, “white stones,” that had\nearned him the sobriquet of “Whitey.”  Lannigan of headquarters,\nWhitey Mack of the underworld, sworn enemies those two–in secret\nsession!  Bristol Bob might well play the part of outer guard.  If a\nchoice few of those outside in the dance hall could get a glimpse\ninto that private room it would be “good-night” to Whitey Mack.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes were narrowed a little as he shuffled on down the\npassage.  Lannigan and Whitey Mack with their heads together!  What\nwas the game?  There was nothing in common between the two men.\nLannigan, it was well known, could not be “reached.”  Whitey Mack,\nwith his ingenious cleverness, coupled with a cold-blooded\nfearlessness that had made him an object of unholy awe and respect\nin the eyes of the underworld, was a thorn that was sore beyond\nmeasure in the side of the police.  Certainly, it was no ordinary\nthing that had brought these two together; especially, since, with\nthe unrest and suspicion that was bubbling and seething below the\ndead line, and with which there was none more intimate than Whitey\nMack, Whitey Mack was inviting a risk in “making up” with the police\nthat could only be accounted for by some urgent and vital incentive.",
        "Jimmie Dale pushed open the door that gave on the lane.  Behind him,\nBristol Bob closed the door of the private room and retreated back\nalong the passage.  Jimmie Dale stepped out into the lane–and\ninstinctively his eyes sought the window of the private room.  The\nshade was drawn, only a yellow murk filtered out into the black,\nunlighted lane, but suddenly he started noiselessly toward it.  The\nwindow was open a bare inch or so at the bottom!",
        "The sill was just shoulder high, and, placing his ear to the\nopening, he flattened himself against the wall.  He could not see\ninside, for the shade was drawn well to the bottom; but he could\nhear as distinctly as though he were at the table beside the two\nmen–and at the first words, the loose, disjointed frame of Larry\nthe Bat seemed to tauten curiously and strain forward lithe and\ntense.",
        "“This Gray Seal dope listens good, Whitey; but, coming from you, I’m\nleery.  You’ve got to show me.”",
        "“Don’t you want him?”  There was a nasty laugh from Whitey Mack.",
        "“You BET I want him!” returned the headquarters man with a\nsuppressed savagery that left no doubt as to his earnestness.  “I\nwant him fast enough, but–”",
        "“Then, blast him, so do I!” Whitey Mack rapped out with a vicious\nsnarl.  “So does every guy in the fleet down here.  We got it in for\nhim.  You get that, don’t you?  He’s got Stangeist and his gang\nsteered for the electric chair now; he put a crimp in the Weasel the\nother night–get that?  He’s like a blasted wizard with what he\nknows.  And who’ll he deal the icy mitt to next?  Me–damn him–me,\nfor all I know!”",
        "“That’s all right,” observed Lannigan coolly.  “I’m not questioning\nyour sincerity for a minute; I know all about that; but that doesn’t\nland the Gray Seal.  I’ll work with you if you’ve anything to offer,\nbut we’ve had enough ’tips’ and ’information’ handed us at\nheadquarters in the last few years to make us a trifle skeptical.\nShow me what you’ve got, Whitey?”",
        "“Show you! “ echoed Whitey Mack passionately.  “Sure, I’ll show you!\nThat’s what I’m going to do–show you.  I’ll show you the Gray Seal!\nI ain’t handing you any tips.  I’VE FOUND OUT WHO THE GRAY SEAL IS!”",
        "There was a tense silence.  It seemed to Jimmie Dale as though cold\nfingers were clutching at his heart, stifling its beat–then the\nblood came bursting to his forehead.  He could not see into the\nroom, but that silence was eloquent.  It seemed as though he could\npicture the two men–Lannigan leaning suddenly forward–Lannigan and\nWhitey Mack staring tensely into each other’s eyes.",
        "“You–WHAT!”  It came low and grim from Lannigan.",
        "“That’s what!” asserted Whitey Mack bluntly.  “You heard me!  That’s\nwhat I said!  I know who the Gray Seal is–and I’m the only guy\nthat’s wise to him.  Am I letting you in right?”",
        "“You’re sure?” demanded Lannigan hoarsely.  “You’re sure?  Who is\nhe, then?”",
        "There was a half laugh, half snarl from Whitey Mack.",
        "“Oh, no, you don’t!” he growled.  “Nix on that!  What do you take\nme for–a fool?  You beat it out of here and round him up–eh–while\nI suck my thumbs?  Say, forget it!  Do you think I’m doing this\nbecause I love you?  Why, blame you, you’ve been aching for a year\nto put the bracelets on me yourself!  Say, wake up!  I’m in on this\nmyself.”",
        "Again that silence.  Then Lannigan spoke slowly, in a puzzled way.",
        "I don’t get you, Whitey,” he said.  “What do you mean?”  Then, a\nlittle sharply: “You’re quite right; you’ve got some reputation\nyourself, and you’re badly ’wanted’ if we could get the ’goods’ on\nyou.  If you’re trying to plant something, look out for yourself,\nor–”",
        "“Can that!” snapped Whitey Mack threateningly.  “Can that sort of\nspiel right now–or quit!  I ain’t telling you his name–yet.  BUT\nI’LL TAKE YOU TO HIM TO-NIGHT–and you and me nabs him together.  Is\nthat straight enough goods for you?”",
        "“Don’t get sore,” said Lannigan, more pacifically.  “Yes, if you’ll\ndo that it’s good enough for any man.  But lay your cards on the\ntable face up, Whitey–I want to see what you opened the pot on.”",
        "“You’ve seen ’em,” Whitey Mack answered ungraciously.  “I’ve told\nyou already.  The Gray Seal goes out for keeps–curse him for a\nsnitch!  If I bumped him off, or wised up any of the guys to it, and\nwe was caught, we’d get the juice for it even if it was the Gray\nSeal, wouldn’t we?  Well, what’s the use!  If one of you dicks get\nhim, he gets bumped off just the same, only regular, up in the wire\nparlour at Sing Sing.  I ain’t looking for that kind of trouble when\nI can duck it.  See?”",
        "“Sure,” said Lannigan.",
        "“Besides, and moreover,” continued Whitey Mack, “there’s SOME reward\nhung out for him that I’m figuring to born in on.  I’d swipe it all\nmyself, don’t you make any mistake about that, and you’d never get a\nlook-in, only, sore as the mob is on the Gray Seal, it ain’t healthy\nfor any guy around these parts to get the reputation of being a\nsnitch, no matter who he snitches on.  Bump him off–sure!\nSnitching–well, you get the idea, eh?  I’m ducking that too.  Get\nme?”",
        "“I get you,” said Lannigan, with a short, pleased laugh.",
        "“Well, then,” announced Whitey Mack, “here’s my proposition, and\nit’s my turn to hand out the ’look-out-for-your-self’ dope.  I’m\nbusting the game wide open for you to play, but you throw me down,\nand\"–his voice sank into a sullen snarl again–\"you can take it\nfrom me, I’ll get you for it!”",
        "“All right,” responded Lannigan soberly.  “Let’s hear it.  If I\nagree to it, I’ll stick to it.”",
        "“I believe you,” said Whitey Mack curtly.  “That’s why I picked you\nout for the medal they’ll pin on you for this.  And here’s getting\ndown to tacks!  I’ll lead you to the Gray Seal to-night and help you\nnab him and stay with you to the finish, but there’s to be nobody\nbut you and me on the job.  When it’s done I fade away, and nobody’s\nto know I snitched, and no questions asked as to how I found out\nabout the Gray Seal.  I ain’t looking for any of the glory–you can\nfix that up to suit yourself.  The cash is different–you come\nacross with half the reward the day they pay it.”",
        "“You’ll get it!”  There was savage elation in Lannigan’s voice, the\nemphatic smash of a fist on the table.  “You’re on, Whitey.  And if\nwe get the Gray Seal to-night, I’ll do better by you than that.”",
        "“We’ll get him!” said Whitey Mack, with a vicious oath.  “And–”",
        "Jimmie Dale crouched suddenly low down, close against the wall.  The\ncrunch of a footstep sounded from the end of the lane.  Some one had\nturned in from the cross street, some fifty yards away, and was\nheading evidently for the back entrance to Bristol Bob’s.  Jimmie\nDale edged noiselessly, cautiously back past the doorway, kept on,\npressed close against the wall, and finally paused.  He had not been\nseen.  The back door of Bristol Bob’s opened and closed.  The man\nhad gone in.",
        "For a moment Jimmie Dale stood hesitant.  There was a wild surging\nin his brain, something like a myriad batteries of trip hammers\nseemed to be pounding at his temples.  Then, almost blindly, he kept\non down the lane in the same direction in which he had started to\nretreat–as well one cross street as another.",
        "He turned into the cross street, went along it–and presently\nemerged into the full tide of the Bowery.  It was garishly lighted;\npeople swarmed about him.  Subconsciously, there were crowded\nsidewalks; subconsciously, he was on the Bowery–that was all.",
        "Ruin, disaster, peril faced him–faced him, and staggered him with\nthe suddenness of the shock.  Was it true?  No; it could not be\ntrue!  It was a bluff–Whitey Mack was bluffing.  Jimmie Dale’s lips\ngrew thin in a mirthless smile as he shook his head.  Neither Whitey\nMack nor any other man would dare to bluff like that.  It was too\nstraight, too open-handed, Whitey Mack had laid his cards too\nplainly on the table.  Whitey Mack’s words rang in his ears: “I’ll\nLEAD you to the Gray Seal to-night and help you nab him and stay\nwith you to the finish.”  The man meant what he said, meant what he\nsaid, too, about the “finish” of the Gray Seal; not a man in the Bad\nLands but meant–death to the Gray Seal!  But how, by what means,\nwhen, where had Whitey Mack got his information?  “I’m the only one\nthat’s wise,” Whitey Mack had said.  It seemed impossible.  It WAS\nimpossible!  Whitey Mack was sincere enough probably in what he had\nsaid, but the man simply could not know.  Whitey Mack could only\nhave spotted some one that, for some reason or other, he IMAGINED\nwas the Gray Seal. That was it–must be it!  Whitey Mack had made a\nmistake. What clew could he have obtained to–",
        "Over the unwashed face of Larry the Bat a gray pallor spread slowly.\nHis fingers were plucking at the frayed edge of his inside vest\npocket.  The dark eyes seemed to turn coal-black.  A laugh, like the\nlaugh of one damned, rose to his lips, and was choked back.  It was\ngone!  GONE!  That thin metal case, like a cigarette case, that,\nbetween the little sheets of oil paper, held those diamond-shaped,\ngray-coloured, adhesive seals, the insignia of the Gray Seal–was\ngone!  Clew!  It seemed as though there were an overpowering nausea\nupon him.  CLEW!  That little case was not a clew–it was a death\nwarrant!",
        "His hands clenched fiercely.  If he could only think for a moment!\nThe lining of his pocket had given away.  The case had dropped out.\nBut there was nothing about the case to identify any one as the Gray\nSeal unless it were found in one’s actual possession.  Therefore\nWhitey Mack, to have solved his identity, must have seen him drop\nthe case.  There could be no question about that.  It was equally\nobvious then that Whitey Mack would know the Gray Seal as Larry the\nBat.  Did he also know him as Jimmie Dale?  Yes, or no?  It was a\nvital question.  His life hung on it.",
        "That keen, facile brain, numbed for the moment, was beginning to\nwork with lightning speed.  It was four o’clock that afternoon when\nhe had assumed the character of Larry the Bat–some time between\nfour o’clock and the present, it was now well after eleven, the case\nhad dropped from his pocket.  There had been ample time then for\nWhitey Mack to have made that appointment with Lannigan–and ample\ntime to have made a surreptitious visit to the Sanctuary.  Had\nWhitey Mack gone there?  Had Whitey Mack found that hiding place in\nthe flooring under the oilcloth?  Had Whitey Mack discovered that\nthe Gray Seal was not only Larry the Bat–but Jimmie Dale?",
        "Jimmie Dale swept his hand across his forehead.  It was damp from\nlittle clinging beads of moisture.  Should he go to the Sanctuary\nand change–become Jimmie Dale again?  Was it the safest thing to\ndo–or the most dangerous?  Even if Whitey Mack had been there and\ndiscovered the dual personality of Larry the Bat, how would he,\nJimmie Dale, know it?  The man would have been crafty enough to have\nleft no sign behind him.  Was it to the Sanctuary that Whitey Mack\nmeant to lead Lannigan that evening–or did Whitey Mack know him as\nJimmie Dale, and to make it the more sensational, plan to carry out\nthe coup, say, at the St. James Club?  Whitey Mack and Lannigan were\nstill at Bristol Bob’s; he had probably time, if he so elected, to\nreach the Sanctuary, change, and get away again.  But every minute\nwas priceless now.  What should he do?  Run from the city as he was\nfor cover–or take the gambler’s chance?  Whitey Mack knew him as\nLarry the Bat–it was not certain that Whitey Mack knew him as\nJimmie Dale.",
        "He had halted, absorbed, in front of a moving-picture theatre.\nGreat placards, at first but a blur of colour, suddenly forced\nthemselves in concrete form upon his consciousness.  Letters a foot\nhigh leaped out at him: “THE DOUBLE LIFE.”  There was the picture of\na banker in his private office hastily secreting a forged paper as\nthe hero in the guise of a clerk entered; the companion picture was\nthe banker in convict stripes staring out from behind the barred\ndoors of a cell.  There seemed a ghastly augury in the coincidence.\nWhy should a thing like that be thrust upon him to shake his nerve\nwhen he needed nerve now more than he had ever needed it in his life\nbefore?",
        "He raised his hand to jerk aimlessly at the brim of his hat, dropped\nhis hand abruptly to his side again, and started quickly, hurriedly\naway through the throng around him.  A sort of savagery had swept\nupon him.  In a flash he had made his decision.  He would take the\ngambler’s chance!  And afterward–Jimmie Dale’s lips were like a\nthin, straight line–it was Whitey Mack’s life or his own!  Whitey\nMack had said he was the only one that was wise–and Whitey Mack had\nnot told Lannigan yet, wouldn’t tell Lannigan until the show-down.\nIf he, Jimmie Dale, got to the Sanctuary, became Jimmie Dale and got\naway again, even if Whitey Mack knew him as Jimmie Dale, there was\nstill a chance.  It was his life or Whitey Mack’s–Whitey Mack, with\nhis lean-jawed, clean-shaven wolf’s face!  If he could get Whitey\nMack before the other was ready to tell Lannigan!  Surely he had the\nright of self-preservation!  Surely his life was as valuable as\nWhitey Mack’s, as valuable as a man’s who, as those in the secrets\nof the underworld knew well enough, had blood upon his hands, who\nlived by crime, who was a menace to the community!  Had he not the\nright to preserve his own life at the expense of one such as that?\nHe had never taken life–the thought was abhorrent!  But was there\nany other way in event of Whitey Mack knowing him as Jimmie Dale?\nHis back was against the wall; he was trapped; certain death, and,\nworse, dishonour stared him in the face.  Lannigan and Whitey Mack\nwould be together–the odds would be two to one against him–and he\nhad no quarrel with Lannigan–somehow he must let Lannigan out of it.",
        "The other side of the street was less crowded.  He crossed over,\nand, still with the shuffling tread that dozens around him knew as\nthe characteristic gait of Larry the Bat, but covering the ground\nwith amazing celerity, he hurried along.  It was only at the end of\nthe block, that cross street from the Bowery that led to the\nSanctuary.  How much time had he?  He turned the corner into the\ndarker cross street.  Whitey Mack would have learned from Bristol\nBob that Larry the Bat had just been there; that is, that Larry the\nBat was not at the Sanctuary.  Whitey Mack would probably be in no\nhurry–he and Lannigan might wait until later, until Whitey Mack\nshould be satisfied that Larry the Bat had gone home.  It was the\nline of least resistance; they would not attempt to scour the city\nfor him.  They might even wait in that private room at Bristol Bob’s\nuntil they decided that it was time to sally out.  He might perhaps\nstill find them there when he got back; at any rate, from there he\nmust pick up their trail again.  On the other hand–all this was but\nsupposition–they might make at once for the Sanctuary to lie in\nwait for him.  In any case there was need, desperate need, for\nhaste.",
        "He glanced sharply around him; and, by the side of the tenement\nhouse now that bordered on the alleyway, with a curious, swift,\ngliding motion, he seemed to blend into the shadow and darkness.  It\nwas the Sanctuary, that room on the first floor of the tenement, the\ntenement that had three entrances, three exits–a passageway through\nto the saloon on the next street that abutted on the rear, the usual\nfront door, and the side door in the alleyway.  Gone was the\nshuffling gait.  Quick, alert, he ran, crouching, bent down, along\nthe alleyway, reached the side door, opened it stealthily, closed it\nbehind him with equal caution, and, in the dark entry, stood\nmotionless, listening intently.",
        "There was no sound.  He began to mount the rickety, dilapidated\nstairs; and, where it seemed that the lightest tread must make them\ncreak out in blatant protest, his trained muscles, delicately\ncompensating his body weight, carried him upward with a silence that\nwas almost uncanny.  There was need of silence, as there was need of\nhaste.  He was not so sure now of the time at his disposal–that he\nhad even reached the Sanctuary FIRST.  How long had he loitered in\nthat half-dazed way on the Bowery?  He did not know–perhaps longer\nthan he had imagined.  There was the possibility that Whitey Mack\nand Lannigan were already above, waiting for him; but, even if they\nwere not already there and he got away before they came, it was\nimperative that no one should know that Larry the Bat had come and\ngone.",
        "He reached the landing, and paused again, his right hand, with a\nvicious muzzle of his automatic peeping now from between his\nfingers, thrown a little forward.  It was black, utterly black,\naround him.  Again that stealthy, catlike tread–and his ear was at\nthe keyhole of the Sanctuary door.  A full minute, priceless though\nit was, passed; then, satisfied that the room was empty, he drew his\nhead back from the keyhole, and those slim, tapering fingers, that\nin their tips seemed to embody all the human senses, felt over the\nlock.  Apparently it had been undisturbed; but that was no proof\nthat Whitey Mack had not been there after finding the metal case.\nWhitey Mack was known to be clever with a lock–clever enough for\nthat, anyhow.",
        "He slipped in the key, turned it, and, on hinges that were always\noiled, silently pushed the door open and stepped across the\nthreshold.  He closed the door until it was just ajar, that any\nsound might reach him from without–and, whipping off his coat,\nbegan to undress swiftly.",
        "There was no light.  He dared not use the gas; it might be seen from\nthe alleyway.  He was moving now quickly, surely, silently here and\nthere.  It was like some weird spectre figure, a little blacker than\nthe surrounding darkness, flitting about the room.  The oilcloth in\nthe corner was turned back, the loose flooring lifted, the clothes\nof Jimmie Dale taken out, the rags of Larry the Bat put in.  The\nminutes flew by.  It was not the change of clothing that took long–\nit was the eradication of Larry the Bat’s make-up from his face,\nthroat, neck, wrists, and hands.  Occasionally his head was turned\nin a tense, listening attitude; but always the fingers were busy,\nworking with swift deftness.",
        "It was done at last.  Larry the Bat had vanished, and in his place\nstood Jimmie Dale, the young millionaire, the social lion of New\nYork, immaculate in well-tailored tweeds.  He stooped to the hole in\nthe flooring, and, his fingers going unerringly to their hiding\nplace, took out a black silk mask and an electric flashlight–his\nautomatic was already in his possession.  His lips parted grimly.\nWho knew what part a flashlight might not play–and he would need\nthe mask for Lannigan’s benefit, even if it did not disguise him\nfrom Whitey Mack.  Had he left any telltale evidence of his visit?\nIt was almost worth the risk of a light to make sure.  He hesitated,\nthen shook his head, and, stooping again, carefully replaced the\nflooring and laid the oilcloth over it–he dared not show a light at\nany cost.",
        "But now even more caution than before was necessary.  At times, the\nlodgers had naturally enough seen their fellow lodger, Larry the\nBat, enter and leave the tenement–none had ever seen Jimmie Dale\neither leave or enter.  He stole across the room to the door, halted\nto assure himself that the hall was empty, slipped out into the\nhall, and locked the door behind him.  Again that trained, long-\npracticed, silent tread upon the stairs.  It seemed as though an\nhour passed before he reached the bottom, and his brain was\nshrieking at him to hurry, hurry, HURRY!  The entryway at last, the\ndoor, the alleyway, a long breath of relief–and he was on the cross\nstreet.",
        "A step, two, he took in the direction of the Bowery–and he was\nbending down as though to tie his shoe, his automatic, from his side\npocket, concealed in his hand.  WAS THAT SOME ONE THERE?  He could\nhave sworn he saw a shadow-like form start out from behind the steps\nof the house on the opposite side of the street as he had emerged\nfrom the alleyway.  In his bent posture, without seemingly turning\nhis head, his eyes swept sharply up and down the other side of the\nill-lighted street.  Nothing!  There was not even a pedestrian in\nsight on the block from there to the Bowery.",
        "Jimmie Dale straightened up nonchalantly, and stooped almost\ninstantly again, as though the lace were still proving refractory.\nAgain that sharp, searching glance.  Again–nothing!  He went\nforward now in apparent unconcern; but his right hand, instead of\nbeing buried in his coat pocket, swung easily at his side.",
        "It was strange!  His ineffective ruse to the contrary, he was\ncertain that he had not been mistaken.  Was it Whitey Mack?  Was the\nquestion answered?  Was the Gray Seal known, too, as Jimmie Dale?\nWere they trailing him now, with the climax to come at the club, at\nhis own palatial home, wherever the surroundings would best lend\nthemselves to assuaging that inordinate thirst for the sensational\nthat was so essentially a characteristic of the confirmed criminal?\nWhat a headline in the morning’s papers it would make!",
        "At the corner he loitered by the curb to light a cigarette–still\nnot a soul in sight on either side of the street behind him, except\na couple of Italians who had just passed by.  Strange again!  The\nintuition, if it were only intuition, was still strong.  He swung\nabruptly on his heel, mingled with the passers-by on the Bowery,\nwalked a rapid half dozen steps until the building hid the cross\nstreet, then ran across the road to the opposite side of the Bowery,\nand, in a crowd now, came back to the corner.  He crossed from curb\nto curb slowly, sheltered by a fringe of people that, however, in no\nway obstructed his view down the side street.  And then Jimmie Dale\nshrugged his shoulders.  He had evidently been mistaken, after all.\nHe was overexcited; his nerves were raw–that, perhaps, was the\nsolution.  Meanwhile, every minute was counting, if Whitey Mack and\nLannigan should still be at Bristol Bob’s.",
        "He kept on down the Bowery, hurrying with growing impatience through\nthe crowds that massed in front of various places of amusement.  He\nhad not intended to come along the Bowery, and, except for what had\noccurred, would have taken a less frequented street.  He would turn\noff at the next block.",
        "He was in front of that moving-picture theatre again.  “THE DOUBLE\nLIFE\"–his eyes were attracted involuntarily to the lurid, overdone\ndisplay.  It seemed to threaten him; it seemed to dangle before him\na premonition as it were, of what the morning held in store; but\nnow, too, it seemed to feed into flame that smouldering fury that\npossessed him.  His life–or Whitey Mack’s!  Men, women, and the\nchildren who turned night into day in that quarter of the city were\nclustered thick around the signs, hiving like bees to the bald\nsensationalism.  Almost savagely he began to force his way through\nthe crowd–and the next instant, like a man stunned, had stopped in\nhis tracks.  His fingers had closed in a fierce, spasmodic clutch\nover an envelope that had been thrust suddenly into his hand.",
        "“JIMMIE!” from somewhere came a low, quick voice.  “Jimmie, it is\nhalf-past eleven now–HURRY.”",
        "He whirled, scanning wildly this face, then that.  It was her voice–\nHER voice!  The Tocsin!  The sensitive fingers were telegraphing to\nhis brain, as they always did, that the texture of the envelope,\ntoo, was hers.  Her voice; yes, anywhere, out of a thousand voices,\nhe would distinguish hers–but her face, he had never seen that.\nWhich, out of all the crowd around him, was hers?  Surely he could\ntell her by her dress; she would be different; her personality alone\nmust single her out.  She–",
        "“Say, have youse got de pip, or do youse t’ink youse owns de earth!\"\na man flung at him, heaving and pushing to get by.",
        "With a start, though he scarcely heard the man, Jimmie Dale moved\non.  His brain was afire.  All the irony of the world seemed massed\nin a sudden, overwhelming attack upon him.  It was useless–\nintuitively he had known it was useless from the instant he had\nheard her voice.  It was always the same–always!  For years she had\neluded him like that, come upon him without warning and disappeared,\nbut leaving always that tangible proof of her existence–a letter,\nthe call of the Gray Seal to arms.  But to-night it was as it had\nnever been before.  It was not alone baffled chagrin now, not alone\nthe longing, the wild desire to see her face, to look into her eyes–\nit was life and death.  She had come at the very moment when she,\nperhaps alone of all the world, could have pointed the way out, when\nlife, liberty, everything that was common to them both was at stake,\nin deadly peril–and she had gone, ignorant of it all, leaving him\nstaggered by the very possibility of the succour that was held up\nbefore his eyes only to be snatched away without power of his to\ngrasp it.  His intuition had not been at fault–he had made no\nmistake in that shadow across the street from the Sanctuary.  It had\nbeen the Tocsin.  He had been followed; and it was she who had\nfollowed him, until, in a crowd, she had seized the opportunity of a\nmoment ago.  Though ultimately, perhaps, it changed nothing, it was\na relief in a way to know that it was she, not Whitey Mack, who had\nbeen lurking there; but her persistent, incomprehensible\ndetermination to preserve the mystery with which she surrounded\nherself was like now to cost them both a ghastly price.  If he could\nonly have had one word with her–just one word!",
        "The letter in his hand crackled under his clenched fist.  He stared\nat it in a half-blind, half-bitter way.  The call of the Gray Seal\nto arms!  Another coup, with its incident danger and peril, that she\nhad planned for him to execute!  He could have laughed aloud at the\ninhuman mockery of it.  The call of the Gray Seal to arms–NOW!\nWhen with every faculty drained to its last resource, cornered,\ntrapped, he was fighting for his very existence!",
        "“Jimmie, it is half-past eleven now–HURRY!”  The words were\njangling discordantly in his brain.",
        "And now he laughed outright, mirthlessly.  A young girl hanging on\nher escort’s arm, passing, glanced at him and giggled.  It was a\ndifferent Jimmie Dale for the moment.  For once his immobility had\nforsaken him.  He laughed again–a sort of unnatural, desperate\nindifference to everything falling upon him.  What did it matter,\nthe moment or two it would take to read the letter?  He looked\naround him.  He was on the corner in front of the Palace Saloon,\nand, turning abruptly, he stepped in through the swinging doors.  As\nLarry the Bat, he knew the place well.  At the rear of the barroom\nand along the side of the wall were some half dozen little stalls,\npartitioned off from each other.  Several of these were unoccupied,\nand he chose the one farthest from the entrance.  It was private\nenough; no one would disturb him.",
        "From the aproned individual who presented himself he ordered a\ndrink.  The man returned in a moment, and Jimmie Dale tossed a coin\non the table, bidding the other keep the change.  He wanted no\ndrink; the transaction was wholly perfunctory.  The waiter was gone;\nhe pushed the glass away from him, and tore the envelope open.",
        "A single sheet, closely written on both sides of the paper, was in\nhis hand.  It was her writing; there was no mistaking that, but\nevery word, every line bore evidence of frantic haste.  Even that\ncustomary formula, “dear philanthropic crook,” that had prefaced\nevery line she had ever written him before, had been omitted.  His\neyes traversed the first few lines with that strange indifference\nthat had settled upon him.  What, after all, did it matter what it\nwas; he could do nothing–not even save himself probably.  And then,\nwith a little start, he read the lines over again, muttering\nsnatches from them.",
        "”. . . Max Diestricht–diamonds–the Ross-Logan stones–wedding–\nsliding panel in wall of workshop–end of the room near window–ten\nboards to the right from side wall–press small knot in the wood in\nthe centre of the tenth board–to-night . . .”",
        "It brought a sudden thrill of excitement to Jimmie Dale that,\nimpossible as he would have believed it an instant ago, for the\nmoment overshadowed the realisation of his own peril.  A robbery\nsuch as that, if it were ever accomplished, would stir the country\nfrom end to end; it would set New York by the ears; it would loose\nthe police in full cry like a pack of bloodhounds with their leashes\nslipped.  The society columns of the newspapers had been busy for\nmonths featuring the coming marriage of the Ross-Logans’ daughter to\none of the country’s young merchant princes.  The combined fortunes\nof the two families would make the young couple the richest in\nAmerica.  The prospective groom’s wedding gift was to be a diamond\nnecklace of perfectly matched, large stones that would eclipse\nanything of the kind in the country.  Europe, the foreign markets,\nhad been literally combed and ransacked to supply the gems.  The\nstones had arrived in New York the day before, the duty on them\nalone amounting to over fifty thousand dollars.  All this had\nappeared in the papers.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s brows drew together in a frown.  On just exactly what\npercentage the duty was figured he did not know; but it was high\nenough on the basis of fifty thousand dollars to assume safely that\nthe assessed value of the stones was not less than four times that\namount.  Two hundred thousand dollars–laid down, a quarter of a\nmillion!  Well, why not?  In more than one quarter diamonds were\nranked as the soundest kind of an investment.  Furthermore, through\npersonal acquaintance with the “high contracting parties,” who were\nin his own set, he knew it to be true.",
        "He shrugged his shoulders.  The papers, too, had thrown the\nlimelight on Max Diestricht, who, though for quite a time the\nfashion in the social world, had, up to the present, been\ncomparatively unknown to the average New Yorker.  His own knowledge\nof Max Diestricht went deeper than the superficial biography\nfurnished by the newspapers–the old Hollander had done more than\none piece of exquisite jewelry work for him.  The old fellow was a\ncharacter that beggared description, eccentric to the point of\nextravagance, and deaf as a post; but, in craftmanship, a modern\nCellini.  He employed no workmen, lived alone over his shop on one\nof the lower streets between Fifth and Sixth Avenues near Washington\nSquare–and possessed a splendid contempt for such protective\ncontrivances as safes and vaults.  If his prospective patrons\nexpostulated on this score before intrusting him with their\nvaluables, they were at liberty to take their work elsewhere.  It\nwas Max Diestricht who honoured you by accepting the commission; not\nyou who honoured Max Diestricht by intrusting him with it.  “Of what\nuse is it to me, a safe!” he would exclaim.  “It hides nothing; it\nonly says, ’I am inside; do not look farther; come and get me!’\nYes?  It is to explode with the nitro-glycerin–POUF!–and I am deaf\nand I hear nothing.  It is a foolishness, that\"–he had a habit of\nprodding at one with a levelled fore-finger–\"every night somewhere\nthey are robbed, and have I been robbed?  HEIN, tell me that; have I\nbeen robbed?”",
        "It was true.  In ten years, though at times having stones and\nprecious metal aggregating large amounts deposited with him by his\ncustomers, Max Diestricht had never lost so much as the gold\nfilings.  There was a queer smile on Jimmie Dale’s lips now.  The\nknot in the tenth board was significant!  Max Diestricht was\nscrupulously honest, a genius in originality and conception of\ndesign, a master in the perfection and delicacy of his finished\nwork–he had been commissioned to design and set the Ross-Logan\nnecklace.",
        "The brain works quickly.  All this and more had flashed almost\ninstantaneously through Jimmie Dale’s mind.  His eyes fell to the\nletter again, and he read on.  Halfway through, a sudden whiteness\nblanched his face, and, following it, a surging tide of red that\nmounted to his temples.  It dazed him; it seemed to rob him for the\nmoment of the power of coherent thought.  He was wrong; he had not\nread aright.  It was incredible, dare-devil beyond belief–and yet\nin its very audacity lay success.  He finished the letter, read it\nonce more–and his fingers mechanically began to tear it into little\nshreds.  His brain was in a whirl, a vortex of conflicting emotions.\nHad Whitey Mack and Lannigan left Bristol Bob’s yet?  Where were\nthey now?  Was there time for–this?  He was staring at the little\ntorn scraps of paper in his hand.  He thrust them suddenly into his\npocket, and jerked out his watch.  It was nearly midnight.  The\nbroad, muscular shoulders seemed to square back curiously, the jaws\nto clamp a little, the face to harden and grow cold until it was\nlike stone.  With a swift movement he emptied his glass into the\ncuspidor, set the glass back on the table, and stepped out from the\nstall.  His destination was Max Diestricht’s.",
        "The Palace Saloon was near the upper end of the Bowery, and, failing\na taxicab, of which none was in sight, his quickest method was to\nwalk, and he started briskly forward.  It was not far; and it was\nbarely ten minutes from the time he had left the Palace Saloon when\nhe swung through Washington Square to Fifth Avenue, and, a moment\nlater, turned from that thoroughfare, heading west toward Sixth\nAvenue, along one of those streets which, with the city’s northward\ntrend, had quite lost any distinctive identity, and from being once\na modestly fashionable residential section had now become a\nconglomerate potpourri of small tradesmen’s stores, shops and\napartments of the poorer class.  He knew Max Diestricht’s–he could\nwell have done without the aid of the arc lamp which, even if dimly,\nindicated that low, almost tumble-down, two-story structure tucked\naway between the taller buildings on either side that almost\nengulfed it.  It was late.  The street was quiet.  The shops and\nstores had long since been closed, Max Diestricht’s among them–the\nold Hollanders’ name in painted white letters stood out against the\nbackground of a darkened workshop window.  In the story above, the\nlights, too, were out; Max Diestricht was probably fast asleep–and\nhe was stone deaf!",
        "A glance up and down the street, and Jimmie Dale was standing, or,\nrather, leaning against Max Diestricht’s door.  There was no one to\nsee, and if there were, what was there to attract attention to a man\nstanding nonchalantly for a moment in a doorway?  It was only for a\nmoment.  Those master fingers of Jimmie Dale were working surely,\nswiftly, silently.  A little steel instrument that was never out of\nhis possession was in the lock and out again.  The door opened,\nclosed; he drew the black silk mask from his pocket and slipped it\nover his face.  Immediately in front of him the stairs led upward;\nimmediately to his right was the door into the shop–the modest\nstreet entrance was common to both.",
        "The door into the workshop was not locked.  He opened it, stepped\ninside, and closed it quietly behind him.  The place was in\nblackness.  He stood for a moment silent, straining his ears to\ncatch the slightest sound, reconstructing the plan of his\nsurroundings in his mind as he remembered it.  It was a narrow,\noblong room, running the entire depth of the building, a very long\nroom, blank walls on either side, a window in the middle of the rear\nwall that gave on a back yard, and from the back yard there was\naccess to the lane; also, as he remembered the place, it was a riot\nof disorder, with workbenches and odds and ends strewn without\nsystem or reason in every direction–one had need of care to\nnegotiate it in the dark.  He took his flashlight from his pocket,\nand, preliminary to a more intimate acquaintance with the interior,\nglanced out through the front window near which he stood–and, with\na suppressed cry, shrank back instinctively against the wall.",
        "Two men were crossing the street, heading directly for the shop\ndoor.  The arc lamp lighted up their faces.  IT WAS INSPECTOR\nLANNIGAN OF HEADQUARTERS AND WHITEY MACK!  The quick intake of\nJimmie Dale breath was sucked through clenched teeth.  They were\nclose on his heels then–far closer than he had imagined.  It would\ntake Whitey Mack scarcely any longer to open that front door than it\nhad taken him.  Close on his heels!  His face was rigid.  He could\nhear them now at the door.  The flashlight in his hand winked down\nthe length of the room.  If was a dangerous thing to do, but it was\nstill more dangerous to stumble into some object and make a noise.\nHe darted forward, circuiting a workbench, a stool, a small hand\nforge.  Again the flashlight gleamed.  Against the side wall, near\nthe rear, was another workbench, with a sort of coarse canvas\ncurtain hanging part way down in front of it, evidently to protect\nsuch things as might be stored away beneath it from dust, and Jimmie\nDale sprang for it, whipped back the canvas, and crawled underneath.\nHe was not an instant too soon.  As the canvas fell back into place,\nthe shop door opened, closed, and the two men had stepped inside.",
        "Whitey Mack’s voice, in a low whisper though it was, seemed to echo\nraucously through the shop.",
        "“Mabbe we’ll have a sweet wait, but I got the straight dope on this.\nHe’s going to make a try for Dutchy’s sparklers to-night.  We’ll let\nhim go the limit, and we don’t either of us make a move till he’s\npinched them, and then we get him with the goods on him.  He can’t\nget away; he hasn’t a hope!  There’s only two ways of getting in\nhere or getting out–this door and window here, and a window that’s\ndown there at the back.  You guard this, and I’ll take care of the\nother end.  Savvy?”",
        "“Right!”  Lannigan answered grimly.  “Go ahead!”",
        "There was the sound of footsteps moving forward, then a vicious\nbump, the scraping of some object along the floor, and a muffled\ncurse from Whitey Mack.",
        "“Use your flashlight!” advised the inspector, in a guarded voice.",
        "“I haven’t got one, damn it!”, growled Whitey Mack.  “It’s all\nright.  I’ll get along.”",
        "Again the steps, but more warily now, as though the man were\ncautiously feeling ahead of him for possible obstacles.  Jimmie Dale\nfor a moment held his breath.  He could have reached out and touched\nthe man as the other passed.  Whitey Mack went on until he had taken\nup a position against the rear wall.  Jimmie Dale heard him as he\nbrushed against it.",
        "Then silence fell.  He was between them now.  Stretched full length\non the floor, Jimmie Dale raised the lower portion of the canvas\naway from in front of his face.  He could see nothing; the place was\nin Stygian blackness; but it had been close and stifling, and, at\nleast, it gave him more air.",
        "The minutes dragged by–each more interminable than the one that had\ngone before.  Not a movement, not a sound, and then, through the\nstillness, very faint at first, came the regular, repressed\nbreathing of Whitey Mack, who was much the nearer of the two men.\nAnd, once noticeable, almost imperceptible as it was it seemed to\npervade the room and fill it with a strange, ominous resonance that\nrose and fell until the blackness palpitated with it.",
        "Slowly, very slowly, Jimmie Dale’s hand crept into his pocket–and\ncrept out again with his automatic.  He lay motionless once more.\nTime in any concrete sense ceased to exist.  Fancied shapes began to\nassume form in the darkness.  By the door, Lannigan stirred\nuneasily, shifting his position slightly.",
        "Was it hours–was it only minutes?  It seemed to ring through the\nnerve-racking stillness like the shriek of a hurtling shell–and it\nwas only a whisper.",
        "“Watch yourself, Lannigan,” whispered Whitey Mack.  “He’s coming now\nthrough the yard!  Don’t move till I start something.  Let him get\nhis paws on the sparklers.”",
        "Silence again.  And then a low rasping at the window, like the\ngnawing of a rat; then, inch by inch, the sash was lifted.  There\nwas the sound as of a body forcing its way over the sill cautiously,\nthen a step upon the floor inside, another, and still another.  The\nfigure of a man loomed up suddenly against the glow of a flashlight\nas he threw the round, white ray inquisitively here and there over\nthe rear wall.  And now he appeared to be counting the boards.  One,\ntwo, three–ten.  His hand ran up and down the tenth board.  Again\nand again he repeated the operation, and something like the snarl of\na baited beast echoed through the room.  He half turned to snatch at\nsomething in his pocket, and the light for a moment showed a black-\nbearded, lowering face, partially hidden by a peaked cap that was\npulled far down over his eyes.",
        "There was the rip and tear of rending wood, as a steel jimmy, in\nlieu of the spring the man evidently could not find, bit in between\nthe boards, a muttered oath of satisfaction, and a portion of the\nwall slid back, disclosing what looked like a metal-lined cupboard.\nHe reached in, seized one of a dozen little boxes, and wrenched off\nthe cover.  A blue, scintillating gleam seemed to leap out to meet\nthe white ray of the flashlight.  The man chuckled hoarsely, and\nbegan to cram the rest of the boxes into his pockets.",
        "Jimmie Dale stirred.  On hands and knees he was creeping now from\nbeneath the workbench.  Something caught and tore behind him–the\ncanvas curtain.  And at the sound, with a sharp cry, the man at the\nwall whirled, the light went out, and he sprang toward the window.\nJimmie Dale gained his feet and leaped forward.  A revolver shot cut\na lane of fire through the blackness; and, above the roar of the\nreport, Whitey Mack’s voice in a fierce yell:",
        "“It’s all right, Lannigan!  I got him!  No–HELL!”  There was a\nterrific crash of breaking glass.  “He’s got away!”",
        "“Not yet, he hasn’t!” gritted Jimmie Dale between his teeth, and his\nclubbed revolver swung crashing to the head of a dark form in front\nof him.",
        "There was a half sigh, half moan.  The form slid limply to the\nfloor.  Lannigan was floundering down the shop, leaping obstacles in\na mad rush, his flashlight picking out the way.",
        "Jimmie Dale stepped swiftly backward, and his hand groped out for\nthe droplight, over the end of the bench, that he had knocked\nagainst in his own rush.  His fingers clutched it–and the lower end\nof the shop was flooded with light.  Except for his felt hat that\nlay a little distance away, there was no sign of Whitey Mack; the\nhuddled form of the man, who but a moment since had chuckled as he\npocketed old Max Diestricht’s gems, lay sprawled, inert, upon the\nfloor, and Lannigan was staring into the muzzle of Jimmie Dale’s\nautomatic.",
        "“Drop that gun, Lannigan!” said Jimmie Dale coolly.  “And I’ll\ntrouble you not to make a noise; it might attract attention from the\nstreet; there’s been too much already.  DROP THAT GUN!”",
        "The revolver clattered from Lannigan’s hand to the floor.  A step\nforward, and Jimmie Dale’s toe sent it spinning under a bench.\nAnother step, and, his revolver still covering the other, he had\nwhipped a pair of handcuffs from the officer’s side pocket.",
        "Lannigan, as though the thought had never occurred to him, offered\nno resistance.  He was staring in a dazed sort of way back and forth\nfrom Jimmie Dale to the man on the floor.",
        "“What’s this mean?” he burst out suddenly, “Where’s–”",
        "“Your wrist, please!” requested Jimmie Dale pleasantly.  “No–the\nleft one.  Thank you\"–as the handcuff snapped shut.  “Now go over\nthere and sit down on the floor beside that fellow.  QUICK!”  Jimmie\nDale’s voice rasped suddenly, imperatively.",
        "Still bewildered, but a little sullen now, Lannigan obeyed.  Jimmie\nDale stooped quickly, and snapped the other link of the handcuff\nover the unconscious man’s right wrist.",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled.",
        "“That’s the approved way of taking your man, isn’t it?  Left wrist\nto the prisoner’s right.  He’s only stunned; he’ll be around in a\nmoment.  Know him?”",
        "Lannigan shook his head.",
        "“Take a good look at him,” invited Jimmie Dale.  “You ought to know\nmost of them in the business.”",
        "Lannigan bent over a little closer, and then, with an amazed cry,\nhis free hand shot forward and tore away the other’s beard.",
        "It Was Whitey Mack!",
        "“My God!” gasped Lannigan.",
        "“Quite so!” said Jimmie Dale evenly.  “You’ll find the diamonds in\nhis pockets, and, excuse me\"–his fingers were running through\nWhitey Mack’s clothes–\"ah, here it is\"–the thin metal case was in\nhis hand–\"a little article that belongs to me, and whose loss, I am\nfree to admit, caused me considerable concern until I was informed\nthat he had only found it without having the slightest idea as to\nwhom it belonged.  It made quite a difference!”  He had opened the\ncase carelessly before Lannigan’s eyes.  “’The Gray Seal!’  I’ll say\nit for you,” said Jimmie Dale whimsically.  “This is what probably\nput the idea into his head, after first, in some way, having\ndiscovered old Max Diestricht’s hiding place; and, if I had given\nhim time enough, he would probably have stuck one of these seals, in\nclumsy imitation of that little eccentricity of mine, on the wall\nover there to stamp the job as genuine.  You begin to get it, don’t\nyou Lannigan?  Pretty sure-fire as an alibi, eh?  And he’d have got\naway with it, too, as far as you were concerned.  He had only to\nfire that shot, smash the window, tuck his false beard, mustache,\nand peaked cap into his pocket, put on his own hat that you see\nthere on the floor–and yell that the man had escaped.  He’d help\nyou chase the thief, too!  Rather neat, don’t you think, Lannigan?\nAnd worth the risk, too, considering the howl that would go up at\nthe theft of those stones, and that, known as the slickest diamond\nthief in the country, he would be the first to be suspected–except\nthat the police themselves, in the person of Inspector Lannigan of\nheadquarters, would be prepared to prove a perfectly good alibi for\nhim.”",
        "Lannigan’s head was thrust forward; his eyes, hard, were riveted on\nWhitey Mack.",
        "“My God!” he said again under his breath.  Then fiercely: “He’ll get\nhis for this!”",
        "It was a moment before Jimmie Dale spoke; he was musingly examining\nthe automatic in his hand.",
        "“I am going now, Lannigan,” he observed quietly.  “I require, say,\nfifteen minutes in which to effect my escape.  It is, of course,\nobvious that an alarm raised by you might prove extremely awkward,\nbut a piece of canvas from that bench there, together with a bit of\nstring, would make a most effective gag.  I prefer, however, not to\nsubmit you to that indignity.  Instead, I offer you the alternative\nof giving me your word to remain quietly where you are for–fifteen\nminutes.”",
        "Lannigan hesitated.",
        "Jimmie Dale smiled.",
        "“I agree,” said Lannigan shortly.",
        "Jimmie Dale stepped back.  The electric-light switch clicked.  The\nplace was in darkness.  There was a moment, two, of utter stillness;\nthen softly, from the front end of the shop, a whisper:",
        "“If I were you, Lannigan, I’d take that gun from Whitey’s pocket\nbefore he comes round and beats you to it.”",
        "And the door had closed silently behind Jimmie Dale.",
        "In the subway, ten minutes before, a freckled-faced messenger boy\nhad squeezed himself into a seat beside Jimmie Dale, yanked a dime\nnovel from a refractory pocket, and, blissfully lost to all the\nworld, had buried his head in its pages.  Jimmie Dale’s glance at\nthe youngster had equally, perforce, embraced the lurid title of the\nthriller, “Dicing with Death,” so imperturbably thrust under his\nnose.  At the time, he had smiled indulgently; but now, as he left\nthe subway and headed for his home on Riverside Drive, the words not\nonly refused to be ignored, but had resolved themselves into a\ncuriously persistent refrain in his mind.  They were exactly what\nthey purported to be, dime-novelish, of the deepest hue of yellow,\nmelodramatic in the extreme; but also, to him now, they were grimly\napt and premonitorily appropriate.  “Dicing with Death\"–there was\nnot an hour, not a moment in the day, when he was not literally\ndicing with death; when, with the underworld and the police allied\nagainst him, a single false move would lose him the throw that left\ndeath the winner!",
        "The risk of the dual life enforced upon him grew daily greater, and\nin the end there must be the reckoning.  He would have been a madman\nto have shut his eyes in the face of what was obvious–but it was\nworth it all, and in his soul he knew that he would not have had it\notherwise even now.  To-night, to-morrow, the day after, would come\nanother letter from the Tocsin, and there would be another “crime\"\nof the Gray Seal’s blazoned in the press–would that be the last\naffair, or would there be another–or to-night, to-morrow, the day\nafter, would he be trapped before even one more letter came!",
        "He shrugged his shoulders, as he ran up the steps of his house.\nThose were the stakes that he himself had laid on the table to wager\nupon the game, he had no quarrel there; but if only, before the end\ncame, or even with the end itself, he could find–HER!",
        "With his latchkey he let himself into the spacious, richly\nfurnished, well-lighted reception hall, and, crossing this, went up\nthe broad staircase, his steps noiseless on the heavy carpet.\nBelow, faintly, he could hear some of the servants–they evidently\nhad not heard him close the door behind him.  Discipline was relaxed\nsomewhat, it was quite apparent, with Jason, that peer of butlers,\naway.  Jason, poor chap, was in the hospital.  Typhoid, they had\nthought it at first, though it had turned out to be some milder form\nof infection.  He would be back in a few days now; but meanwhile he\nmissed the old man sorely from the house.",
        "He reached the landing, and, turning, went along the hall to the\ndoor of his own particular den, opened the door, closed it behind\nhim–and in an instant the keen, agile brain, trained to the little\nthings that never escaped it, that daily held his life in the\nbalance, was alert.  The room was unusually dark, even for night-\ntime.  It was as though the window shades had been closely drawn–a\nthing Jason never did.  But then Jason wasn’t there!  Jimmie Dale,\nsmiling then a little quizzically at himself, reached up for the\nelectric-light switch beside the door, pressed it–and, his finger\nstill on the button, whipped his automatic from his pocket with his\nother hand.  THE ROOM WAS STILL IN DARKNESS.",
        "The smile on Jimmie Dale’s lips was gone, for his lips now had\nclosed together in a tight, drawn line.  The lights in the rest of\nthe house, as witness the reception hall, were in order.  This was\nno ACCIDENT!  Silent, motionless, he stood there, listening.  Was he\ntrapped at last–in his own house!  By whom?  The police?  The thugs\nof the underworld?  It made little difference–the end would differ\nonly in the method by which it was attained!  What was that!  Was\nthere a slight stir, a movement at the lower end of the room–or was\nit his imagination?  His hand fell from the electric-light switch to\nthe doorknob behind his back.  Slowly, without a sound, it began to\nturn under his slim, tapering fingers, whose deft, sensitive touch\nhad made him known and feared as the master cracksman of them all;\nand, as noiselessly, the door began to open.",
        "It was like a duel–a duel of silence.  What was the intruder,\nwhoever he might be, waiting for?  The abortive click of the\nelectric-light switch, to say nothing of the opening of the door\nwhen he had entered, was evidence enough that he was there.  Was the\nother trying to place him exactly through the darkness to make sure\nof his attack!  The door was open now.  And suddenly Jimmie Dale\nlaughed easily aloud–and on the instant shifted his position.",
        "“Well?” inquired Jimmie Dale coolly from the other side of the\nthreshold.",
        "It seemed like a long-drawn sigh fluttering through the room, a gasp\nof relief–and then the blood was pounding madly at his temples, and\nhe was back in the room again, the door closed once more behind him.",
        "“Oh, Jimmie–why didn’t you speak?  I had to be sure that it was\nyou.”",
        "It was her voice!  HERS!  The Tocsin!  HERE!  She was here–here in\nhis house!",
        "“You!” he cried.  “You–here!”  He was pressing the electric-light\nswitch frantically, again and again.",
        "Her voice came out of the darkness from across the room:",
        "“Why are you doing that, Jimmie?  You know already that I have\nturned off the lights.”",
        "“At the sockets–of course!”  He laughed out the words almost\nhysterically.  “Your face–I have never seen your face, you know.\"\nHe was moving quickly toward the reading lamp on his desk.",
        "There was a quick, hurried swish of garments, and she was blocking\nhis way.",
        "“No,” she said, in a low voice; “you must not light that lamp.”",
        "He laughed again, shortly, fiercely now.  She was close to him, his\nhands reached out for her, touched her, and thrilling at the touch,\nswept her toward him.",
        "“Jimmie–Jimmie–are you mad!” she breathed.",
        "Mad!  Yes–he was mad with the wildest, most passionate exhilaration\nhe had ever known.  He found his voice with an effort.",
        "“These months and years that I have tried until my soul was sick to\nfind you!” he cried out.  “And you are here now!  Your face–I must\nsee your face!”",
        "She had wrenched herself away from him.  He could hear her breath\ncoming sharply in little gasps.  He groped his way onward toward the\ndesk.",
        "“WAIT!\"–her tones seemed to ring suddenly vibrant through the room.\n\"Wait, before you touch that lamp!  I–I put you on your honour not\nto light it.”",
        "He stopped abruptly.",
        "“My–honour?” he repeated mechanically.",
        "“Yes!  I came here to-night because there was no other way.  No\nother way–do you understand?  I came, trusting to your honour not\nto take advantage of the conditions that forced me to do this.  I\nhad no fear that I was wrong–I have no fear now.  You will not\nlight that lamp, and you will not make any attempt to prevent my\ngoing away as I came–unknown.  Is there any question about it,\nJimmie?  I am in YOUR house.”",
        "“You don’t know what you are saying!” he burst out wildly.  “I’ve\nrisked my life for a chance like this again and again; I’ve gone\nthrough hell, living in squalour for a month on end as Larry the Bat\nin the hope that I might discover who you are–and do you think I’ll\nlet anything stop me now!  I tell you, no–a thousand times no!”",
        "She made no answer.  There was only her low, quick breathing coming\nfrom somewhere near him.  He made another step toward the lamp–and\nstopped.",
        "“I tell you, no!” he said again, and took another step forward–and\nstopped once more.",
        "Still she made no answer.  A minute passed–another.  His hand\nlifted and swept across his forehead in an agitated way.  Still\nsilence.  She neither moved nor spoke.  His hand dropped slowly to\nhis side.  There was a queer, twisted smile upon his lips.",
        "“You win!” he said hoarsely.",
        "“Thank you, Jimmie,” she said simply.",
        "“And your name, who you are\"–he was speaking, but he did not seem\nto recognise his own voice–\"the hundred other things I’ve sworn I’d\nmake you explain when I found you, are all taboo as well, I\nsuppose!”",
        "“Yes,” she said.",
        "He laughed bitterly.",
        "“Don’t you know,” he cried out, “that between the police and the\nunderworld, our house of cards is likely to collapse at any minute–\nthat they are hunting the Gray Seal day and night!  Is it to be\nalways like this–that I am never to know–until it is too late!",
        "She came toward him out of the darkness impulsively.",
        "“They will never get you, Jimmie,” she said, in a suppressed voice.\nAnd some day, I promise you now, you shall have your reward for to-\nnight.  You shall know–everything.”",
        "“When?”  The word came from him with fierce eagerness.",
        "“I do not know,” she answered gently.  “Soon, perhaps–perhaps\nsooner than either of us imagine.”",
        "“And by that you mean–what?” he asked, and his hand reached out for\nher again through the blackness.",
        "This time she did not draw away.  There was an instant’s hesitation;\nthen she spoke again hurriedly, a note of anxiety in her voice.",
        "“You are beginning all over again, aren’t you, Jimmie?  And I have\ntold you that to-night I can explain nothing.  And, besides, it is\nwhat has brought me here that counts now, and every moment is of–”",
        "“Yes.  I know,” he interposed; “but, then, at least you will tell me\none thing: Why did you come to-night, instead of sending me a letter\nas you always have before?”",
        "“Because it is different to-night than it ever was before,” she\nreplied earnestly.  “Because there is something in what has happened\nthat I cannot explain myself; because there is danger, and where I\ncould not see clearly I feared a trap, and so I dared not send what,\nin a letter, could at best be only vague and incomplete details.  Do\nyou see?”",
        "“Yes,” said Jimmie Dale–but he was only listening in an abstracted\nway.  If he could only see that face, so close to his!  He had\nyearned for that with all his soul for years now!  And she was here,\nstanding beside him, and his hand was upon her arm; and here, in his\nown den, in his own house, he was listening to another call to arms\nfor the Gray Seal from her own lips!  Honour!  Was he but a poor,\nquixotic fool!  He had only to step to the desk and switch on the\nlight!  Why should–he steadied himself with a jerk, and drew away\nhis hand.  She was in HIS house.  “Go on,” he said tersely.",
        "“Do you know, or did you ever hear of old Luther Doyle?” she asked.",
        "“No,” said Jimmie Dale.",
        "“Do you know a man, then, named Connie Myers?”",
        "Connie Myers!  Who in the Bad Lands did not know Connie Myers, who\nboasted of the half dozen prison sentences already to his credit?\nYes; he knew Connie Myers!  But, strangely enough, it was not in the\nBad Lands or as Larry the Bat that he knew the man, or that the\nother knew him–it was as Jimmie Dale.  Connie Myers had introduced\nhimself one night several years ago with a blackjack that had just\nmissed its mark as the man had jumped out from a dark alleyway on\nthe East Side, and he, Jimmie Dale, had thrashed the other to within\nan inch of his life.  He had reason to know Connie Myers–and Connie\nMyers had reason to remember him!",
        "“Yes,” he said, with a grim smile; “I know Connie Myers.”",
        "“And the tenement across the street from where you live as Larry the\nBat–that, of course, you know.”  He leaned toward her wonderingly\nnow.",
        "“Of course!” he ejaculated.  “Naturally!”",
        "“Listen, then, Jimmie!”  She was speaking quickly now.  “It is a\nstrange story.  This Luther Doyle was already over fifty, when, some\neight or nine years ago, his parents died within a few months of\neach other, and he inherited somewhere in the neighbourhood of a\nhundred thousand dollars; but the man, though harmless enough, was\nmildly insane, half-witted, queer, and the old couple, on account of\ntheir son’s mental defects, took care to leave the money securely\ninvested, and so that he could only touch the interest.  During\nthese eight or nine years he has lived by himself in the same old\nfamily house where he had lived with his parents, in a lonely spot\nnear Pelham.  And he has lived in a most frugal, even miserly,\nmanner.  His income could not have been less than six thousand\ndollars a year, and his expenditures could not have been more than\nsix hundred.  His dementia, ironically enough from the day that he\ncame into his fortune, took the form of a most pitiable and abject\nfear that he would die in poverty, misery, and want; and so, year\nafter year, cashing his checks as fast as he got them, never\ntrusting the bank with a penny, he kept hiding away somewhere in his\nhouse every cent he could scrape and save from his income–which to-\nday must amount, at a minimum calculation, to fifty thousand\ndollars.”",
        "“And,” observed Jimmie Dale quietly.  “Connie Myers robbed him of\nit, and–”",
        "“No!”  Her voice was quivering with passion, as she caught up his\nwords.  “Twice in the last month Connie Myers TRIED to rob him, but\nthe money was too securely hidden.  Twice he broke into Doyle’s\nhouse when the old man was out, but on both occasions was\nunsuccessful in his search, and was interrupted and forced to make\nhis escape on account of Doyle’s return.  To-night, an hour ago, in\nan empty room on the second floor of that tenement, in the room\nfacing the landing, old Luther Doyle was MURDERED!”",
        "There was silence for an instant.  Her hand had closed in a tight\npressure on his arm.  The darkness seemed to add a sort of ghastly\nsignificance to her words.",
        "“In God’s name, how do you know all this?” he demanded wildly.  “How\ndo you know all these things?",
        "“Does that matter now?” she answered tensely.  “You will know that\nwhen you know the rest.  Oh, don’t you understand, Jimmie, there is\nnot a moment to lose now?  It was easy to lure a half-witted\ncreature like that anywhere; it was Connie Myers who lured him to\nthe tenement and murdered him there–but from that point, Jimmie, I\nam not sure of our ground.  I do not know whether Connie Myers is\nalone in this or not; but I do know that he is going to Doyle’s\nhouse again to-night to make another search for the money.  There is\nno question but that old Doyle was murdered to give Connie Myers and\nhis accomplices, if there are any, a chance to tear the house inside\nout to find the money, to give them the whole night to work in\nwithout interruption if necessary–but Doyle dead in his own house\ncould have interfered no more with them than Doyle dead in that\ntenement!  Why was he lured to the tenement by Connie Myers when he\ncould much more easily have been put out of the way in his own\nhouse?  Jimmie, there is something behind this, something more that\nyou must find out.  There may be others in this besides Connie\nMyers, I do not know; but there is something here that I am afraid\nof.  Jimmie, you must get that man, you must get the others if there\nare others, and you must stop them from getting the money in that\nhouse to-night!  Do you understand now why I have come here?  I\ncould not explain in a letter; I do not quite seem to be explaining\nnow.  It would seem as though there were no need for the Gray Seal–\nthat simply the police should be notified.  But I KNOW, Jimmie, call\nit intuition, what you will, I know that there is need for us, for\nyou to-night–that behind all this is a tragedy, deeper, blacker,\nthan even the brutal, cold-blooded murder that is already done.”",
        "Her voice, in its passionate earnestness, died away; and an anger,\ncold, grim, remorseless, settled upon Jimmie Dale–settled as it\nalways settled upon him at her call to arms.  His brain was already\nat work in its quick, instant way, probing, sifting, planning.  She\nwas right!  It was strange, it was more than strange that, with the\nadded risk, the danger, the difficulty, the man should have been\nbrought miles to be done away with in that tenement!  Why?  Connie\nMyers took form before him–the coarse features, the tawny hair that\nstraggled across the low forehead, the shifty eyes that were an\nindeterminate colour between brown and gray, the thin lips that\nseemed to draw in and give the jaw a protruding, belligerent effect.\nAnd Connie Myers knew him as Jimmie Dale–it would have to be then\nas Larry the Bat that the Gray Seal must work.  That meant time–to\ngo to the Sanctuary and change.",
        "“The police,” he asked suddenly, aloud, “they have not yet\ndiscovered the body?”",
        "“Not yet,” she replied hurriedly.  “And that is still another reason\nfor haste–there is no telling when they will.  See–here!”  She\nthrust a paper into his hand.  “Here is a plan of old Doyle’s house,\nand directions for finding it.  You must get Connie Myers red-\nhanded, you must make him convict himself, for the evidence through\nwhich I know him to be guilty can never be used against him.  And,\nJimmie, be careful–I know I am not wrong, that there is still\nsomething more behind all this.  And now go, Jimmie, go!  There is\nno time to lose!”  She was pushing him across the room toward the\ndoor.",
        "Go!  The word seemed suddenly to bring dismay.  It was she again who\nwas dominant now in his mind.  Who knew if to-night, when he was\ntaking his life in his hands again, would not be the last!  And she\nwas here now, here beside him–where she might never be again!",
        "She seemed to divine his thoughts, for she spoke again, a strange\nnew note of tenderness in her voice that thrilled him.",
        "“You must never let them get you, Jimmie–for my sake.  It will not\nlast much longer–it is near the end–and I shall keep my promise.\nBut go, now, Jimmie–go!”",
        "“Go?” he repeated numbly.  “Go?  But–but you?”",
        "“I?”  She slipped suddenly away from him, retreating back down the\nroom.  “I will go–as I came.”",
        "“Wait!  Listen!” he pleaded.",
        "There was no answer.",
        "She was there–somewhere back there in the darkness still.  He stood\nhesitant at the door.  It seemed that every faculty he possessed\nurged him back there again–to her.  Could he let her escape him now\nwhen she was so utterly in his power, she who meant everything in\nhis life!  And then, like a cold shock, came that other thought–she\nwho had trusted to his honour!  With a jerk, his hand swept out,\nfelt for the doorknob, and closed upon it.",
        "“Good-night!” he said heavily, and stepped out into the hall.",
        "It seemed for a while, even after he had gained the street and made\nhis way again to the subway, that nothing was concrete around him,\nthat he was living through some fantastical dream.  His head\nwhirled, and he could not think rationally–and then slowly, little\nby little, his grip upon himself came back.  She had come–and gone!\nWith the roar of the subway in his ears, its raucous note seeming to\nstrike so perfectly in consonance with the turmoil within him, he\nsmiled mirthlessly.  After all, it was as it always was!  She was\ngone–and ahead of him lay the chances of the night!",
        "“Dicing with death!”  The words, unbidden, came back once more.  If\nthey were true before, they were doubly applicable now.  It was\ndifferent to-night from what it had ever been before, as she had\nsaid.  Usually, to the smallest detail, everything was laid open,\nclear before him in those astounding letters.  To-night, it was\nvague at best.  A man had been murdered.  Connie Myers had committed\nthe murder under circumstances that pointed strongly to some hidden\nmotive behind and beyond the mere chance it afforded him to search\nhis victim’s house for the hidden cash.  What was it?",
        "Jimmie Dale stared out at the black subway walls.  The answer would\nnot come.  Station after station passed.  At Fourteenth Street he\nchanged from the express to a local, got out at Astor Place, and a\nfew minutes later was walking rapidly down the upper end of the\nBowery.",
        "The answer would not come–only the fact itself grew more and more\ndeeply significant.  The ghastly, callous fiendishness that lured an\nold, half-witted man to his death had Jimmie Dale in that grip of\ncold, merciless anger again, and there was a dull flush now upon his\ncheeks.  Whatever it meant, whatever was behind it, one thing at\nleast was certain–HE WOULD GET CONNIE MYERS!",
        "He was close to the Sanctuary now–it was down the next cross\nstreet.  He reached the corner and turned it, heading east; but his\nbrisk walk had changed to a nonchalant saunter–there were some\npeople coming toward him.  It was the Gray Seal now, alert and\ncautious.  The little group passed by.  Ahead, the tenement\nbordering on the black alleyway loomed up–the Sanctuary, with its\nthree entrances and exits; the home of Larry the Bat.  And across\nfrom it was that other tenement, that held a new interest for him\nnow, where, in an empty room on the second floor, she had said, old\nDoyle still lay.  Should he go there?  He was thinking quickly now,\nand shook his head.  It would take what he did not have to spare–\ntime.  It was already ten o’clock; and, granted that Connie Myers\nhad committed the crime only a little over an hour ago, the man by\nthis time would certainly be on his way to Doyle’s house near\nPelham, if, indeed, he were not already there.  No, there was no\ntime to spare–the question resolved itself simply into how long,\nsince he had already searched twice and failed on both occasions, it\nwould take Connie Myers to unearth old Doyle’s hiding place for the\nmoney.",
        "Jimmie Dale glanced sharply around him, slipped into the alleyway,\nand, crouching against the tenement wall, moved noiselessly along to\nthe side entrance.  A moment more, and he had negotiated the rickety\nstairs with practiced, soundless tread, was inside the squalid\nquarters of Larry the Bat, and the door of the Sanctuary was locked\nand bolted behind him.",
        "Perhaps five minutes passed–and then, where Jimmie Dale, the\nmillionaire, had entered, there emerged Larry the Bat, of the\naristocracy and the elite of the Bad Lands.  But instead of leaving\nby the side door and the alleyway, as he had entered, he went along\nthe lower hallway to the front entrance.  And here, instinctively,\nhe paused a moment at the top of the steps, as his eyes rested upon\nthe tenement on the opposite side of the street.",
        "It was strange that the crime should have been committed there!\nSomething again seemed to draw him toward that empty room on the\nsecond story.  He had decided once that he would not go, that there\nwas not time; but, after all, it would not take long, and there was\nat least the possibility of gaining something more valuable even\nthan time from the scene of the crime itself–there might even be\nthe evidence he wanted there that would disclose the whole of Connie\nMyers’ game.",
        "He went down the steps, and started across the street; but halfway\nover, he hesitated uncertainly, as a child’s cry came petulantly\nfrom the doorway.  It was dark in the street; and, likewise, it was\none of those hot, suffocating evenings when, in the crowded\ntenements of the poorer class, miserable enough in any case, misery\nwas added to a hundredfold for lack of a single God-given breath of\nair.  These two facts, apparently irrelevant, caused Jimmie Dale to\nchange his mind again.  He had not noticed the woman with the baby\nin her arms, sitting on the doorstep; but now, as he reached the\ncurb, he not only saw, but recognised her–and he swung on down the\nstreet toward the Bowery.  He could not very well go in without\npassing her, without being recognised himself–and that was a\nneedless risk.",
        "He smiled a little wanly.  Once the crime was discovered, she would\nnot have hesitated long before informing the police that she had\nseen him enter there!  Mrs. Hagan was no friend of his!  One could\nnot live as he had lived, as Larry the Bat, and not see something in\nan intimate way of the pitiful little tragedies of the poor around\nhim; for, bad, tough, and dissolute as the quarter was, all were not\ndegraded there, some were simply–poor.  Mrs. Hagan was poor.  Her\nhusband was a day labourer, often out of a job–and sometimes he\ndrank.  That was how he, Jimmie Dale, or rather, Larry the Bat, had\ncome to earn Mrs. Hagan’s enmity.  He had found Mike Hagan drunk one\nnight, and in the act of being arrested, and had wheedled the man\naway from the officer on the promise that he would take Hagan home.\nAnd he was Larry the Bat, a dope fiend, a character known to all the\nneighbourhood, and Mrs. Hagan had laid her husband’s condition to\nHIS influence and companionship!  He had taken Mike Hagan home–and\nMrs. Hagan had driven Larry the Bat from the door of her miserable\none-room lodging in that tenement with the bitter words on her\ntongue that only a woman can use when shame and grief and anger are\nbreaking her heart.",
        "He shrugged his shoulders, as, back along the Bowery, he retraced\nhis steps, but now, with the hurried shuffle of Larry the Bat where\nbefore had been the brisk, athletic stride of Jimmie Dale.",
        "At Astor Place again, he took the subway, this time to the Grand\nCentral Station–and, well within an hour from the time he had left\nthe Sanctuary, including the train journey to Pelham, he was\nstanding in a clump of trees that fringed a deserted roadway.  He\nhad passed but few houses, once he was away from Pelham, and, as\nwell as he could judge, there was none now within a quarter of a\nmile of him–except this one of old Luther Doyle’s that showed up\nblack and shadowy just beyond the trees.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes narrowed as he surveyed the place.  It was little\nwonder that, known to have money, an attempt to rob old Doyle should\nhave been made in a place like this!  It was even more grimly\nsignificant than ever of some deeper meaning that, in its loneliness\nan ideal place for a murder, the man should have been lured from\nthere for that purpose to a crowded tenement in the city instead!\nWhat did it mean?  Why had it been done?  He shook his head.  The\nanswer would not come now any more than it had come before in the\nsubway, or in the train on the way out, when he had set his brain so\nfutilely to solve the problem.",
        "From a survey of the house, Jimmie Dale gave attention to the\ndetails of his surroundings: the trees on either side; the open\nspace in front, a distance of fifty yards to the road; the absence\nof any fence.  And then, abruptly, he stole forward.  There was no\nlight to be seen anywhere about the house.  Was it possible that\nConnie Myers was not yet there?  He shook his head again\nimpatiently.  Connie Myers would not have wasted any time–as the\nTocsin had said, there was always present the possibility that the\ncrime in that tenement might be discovered at ANY moment.  Connie\nMyers would have lost no time; for, let the discovery be made, let\nthe police identify the body, as they most certainly would, and they\nwould be out here hotfoot.  Jimmie Dale stood suddenly still.  What\ndid it mean!  He had not thought of that before!  If old Doyle had\nbeen murdered HERE, there would not have been even the possibility\nof discovery until the morning at the earliest, and Connie Myers\nwould have had all the time he wanted!",
        "WHAT WAS THAT SOUND!  A low, muffled tapping, like a succession of\nhammer blows, came from within the house.  Jimmie Dale darted\nforward, reached the side of the house, and dropped on hands and\nknees.  One question at least was answered–Connie Myers was inside.",
        "The plan that she had given him showed an old-fashioned cellarway,\nclosed by folding trapdoors, that was located a little toward the\nrear and, in a moment, creeping along, he came upon it.  His hands\nfelt over it.  It was shut, fastened by a padlock on the outside.\nJimmie Dale’s lips thinned a little, as he took a small steel\ninstrument from his pocket.  Either through inadvertence or by\nintention, Connie Myers had passed up an almost childishly simple\nmeans of entrance into the house!  One side of the trapdoor was\nlifted up silently–and silently closed.  Jimmie Dale was in the\ncellar.  The hammering, much more distinct now, heavy, thudding\nblows, came from a room in the front–the connection between the\ncellar and the house, as shown on the Tocsin’s plan, was through\nanother trapdoor in the floor of the kitchen.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s flashlight played on a short, ladderlike stairway, and\nin an instant he was climbing upward.  The sounds from the front of\nthe house continued now without interruption; there was little fear\nthat Connie Myers would hear anything else–even the protesting\nsqueak of the hinges as Jimmie Dale cautiously pushed back the\ntrapdoor in the flooring above his head.  An inch, two inches he\nlifted it; and, his eyes on a level with the opening now, he peered\ninto the room.  The kitchen itself was intensely dark; but through\nan open doorway, well to one side so that he could not see into the\nroom beyond, there struggled a curiously faint, dim glimmer of\nlight.  And then Jimmie Dale’s form straightened rigidly on the\nstairs.  The blows stopped, and a voice, in a low growl, presumably\nConnie Myers’, reached him.",
        "“Here, take a drive at it from the lower edge!”",
        "There was no answer–save that the blows were resumed again.  Jimmie\nDale’s face had set hard.  Connie Myers was not alone in this, then!\nWell, the odds were a little heavier, DOUBLED–that was all!  He\npushed the trapdoor wide open, swung himself up through the opening\nto the floor; and the next instant, back a little from the\nconnecting doorway, his body pressed closely against the kitchen\nwall, he was staring, bewildered and amazed, into the next room.",
        "On the floor, presumably to lessen the chance of any light rays\nstealing through the tightly drawn window shades, burned a small oil\nlamp.  The place was in utter confusion.  The right-hand side of a\nlarge fireplace, made of rough, untrimmed stone and cement, and\nwhich occupied almost the entire end of the room, was already\npractically demolished, and the wreckage was littered everywhere;\npart of the furniture was piled unceremoniously into one corner out\nof the way; and at the fireplace itself, working with sledge and\nbar, were two men.  One was Connie Myers.  An ironical glint crept\ninto Jimmie Dale’s eyes.  The false beard and mustache the man wore\nwould deceive no one who knew Connie Myers!  And that he should be\nwearing them now, as he knelt holding the bar while the other struck\nat it, seemed both uncalled for and absurd.  The other man, heavily\nbuilt, roughly dressed, had his back turned, and Jimmie Dale could\nnot see his face.",
        "The puzzled frown on Jimmie Dale’s forehead deepened.  Somewhere in\nthe masonry of the fireplace, of course, was where old Luther Doyle\nhad hidden his money.  That was quite plain enough; and that Connie\nMyers, in some way or other, had made sure of that fact was equally\nobvious.  But how did old Luther Doyle get his money IN there from\ntime to time, as he received the interest and dividends whose\naccumulation, according to the Tocsin, comprised his hoard!  And how\ndid he get it OUT again?",
        "“All right, that’ll do!” grunted Connie Myers suddenly.  “We can pry\nthis one out now.  Lend a hand on the bar!”",
        "The other dropped his sledge, turned sideways as he stooped to help\nConnie Myers, his face came into view–and, with an involuntary\nstart, Jimmie Dale crouched farther back against the wall, as he\nstared at the other.  It was Hagan!  Mrs. Hagan’s husband!  Mike\nHagan!”",
        "“My God!” whispered Jimmie Dale, under his breath.",
        "So that was it!  That the murder had been committed in the tenement\nwas not so strange now!  A surge of anger swept Jimmie Dale–and was\nengulfed in a wave of pity.  Somehow, the thin, tired face of Mrs.\nHagan had risen before him, and she seemed to be pleading with him\nto go away, to leave the house, to forget that he had ever been\nthere, to forget what he had seen, what he was seeing now.  His\nhands clenched fiercely.  How realistically, how importunately, how\npitifully she took form before him!  She was on her knees, clasping\nhis knees, imploring him, terrified,",
        "From Jimmie Dale’s pocket came the black silk mask.  Slowly, almost\nhesitantly, he fitted it over his face–Mike Hagan knew Larry the\nBat.  Why should he have pity for Mike Hagan?  Had he any for Connie\nMyers?  What right had he to let pity sway him!  The man had gone\nthe limit; he was Connie Myers’ accomplice–a murderer!  But the man\nwas not a hardened, confirmed criminal like Connie Myers.  Mike\nHagan–a murderer!  It would have been unbelievable but for the\nevidence before his own eyes now.  The man had faults, brawled\nenough, and drank enough to have brought him several times to the\nnotice of the police–but this!",
        "Jimmie Dale’s eyes had never left the scene before him.  Both men\nwere throwing their weight upon the bar, and the stone that they\nwere trying to dislodge–they were into the heart of the masonry\nnow–seemed to move a little.  Connie Myers stood up, and, leaning\nforward, examined the stone critically at top and bottom, prodding\nit with the bar.  He turned from his examination abruptly, and\nthrust the bar into Hagan’s hands.",
        "“Hold it!” he said tersely.  “I’ll strike for a turn.”",
        "Crouched, on his hands and knees, Hagan inserted the point of the\nbar into the crevice.  Connie Myers picked up the sledge.",
        "“Lower!  Bend lower!” he snapped–and swung the sledge.",
        "It seemed to go black for a moment before Jimmie Dale’s eyes, seemed\nto paralyse all action of mind and body.  There was a low cry that\nwas more a moan, the clang of the iron bar clattering on the floor,\nand Mike Hagan had pitched forward on his face, an inert and huddled\nheap.  A half laugh, half snarl purled from Connie Myers’ lips, as\nhe snatched a stout piece of cord from his pocket and swiftly\nknotted the unconscious man’s wrists together.  Another instant,\nand, picking up the bar, prying with it again, the loosened stone\ntoppled with a crash into the grate.",
        "It had come sudden as the crack of doom, that blow–too quick, too\nunexpected for Jimmie Dale to have lifted a finger to prevent it.\nAnd now that the first numbed shock of mingled horror and amazement\nwas past, he fought back the quick, fierce impulse to spring out on\nConnie Myers.  Whether the man was killed or only stunned, he could\ndo no good to Mike Hagan now, and there was Connie Myers–he was\nstaring in a fascinated way at Connie Myers.  Behind the stone that\nthe other had just dislodged was a large hollow space that had been\nleft in the masonry, and from this now Connie Myers was eagerly\ncollecting handfuls of banknotes that were rolled up into the shape\nof little cylinders, each one grotesquely tied with a string.  The\nman was feverishly excited, muttering to himself, running from the\nfireplace to where the table had been pushed aside with the rest of\nthe furniture, dropping the curious little rolls of money on the\ntable, and running back for more.  And then, having apparently\nemptied the receptacle, he wriggled his body over the dismantled\nfireplace, stuck his head into the opening, and peered upward.",
        "“Kinks in his nut, kinks in his nut!” Connie Myers was muttering.\n\"I’ll drop the bar through from the top, mabbe there’s some got\nstuck in the pipe.”",
        "He regained his feet, picked up the bar, and ran with it into what\nwas evidently the front hall–then his steps sounded running\nupstairs.",
        "Like a flash, Jimmie Dale was across the room and at the fireplace.\nLike Connie Myers, he, too, put his head into the opening; and then,\na queer, unpleasant smile on his lips, he bent quickly over the man\non the floor.  Hagan was no more than stunned, and was even then\nbeginning to show signs of returning consciousness.  There was a\nrattle, a clang, a thud–and the bar, too long to come all the way\nthrough, dropped into the opening and stood upright.  Connie Myers’\nfootsteps sounded again, returning on the run–and Jimmie Dale was\nback once more on the other side of the kitchen doorway.",
        "It was all simple enough–once one understood!  The same queer smile\nwas still flickering on Jimmie Dale’s lips.  There was no way to get\nthe money out, except the way Connie Myers had got it out–by\ndigging it out!  With the irrational cunning of his mad brain, that\nhad put the money even beyond his own reach, old Doyle had built his\nfireplace with a hollow some eighteen inches square in a great wall\nof solid stonework, and from it had run a two-inch pipe up somewhere\nto the story above; and down this pipe he had dropped his little\nstring-tied cylinders of banknotes, satisfied that his hoard was\nsafe!  There seemed something pitfully ironic in the elaborate,\ninsane craftiness of the old man’s fear-twisted, demented mind.",
        "And now Connie Myers was back in the room again–and again a puzzled\nexpression settled upon Jimmie Dale’s face as he watched the other.\nFor perhaps a minute the man stood by the table sifting the little\nrolls of money through his fingers gloatingly–then, impulsively, he\npushed these to one side, produced a revolver, laid it on the table,\nand from another pocket took out a little case which, as he opened\nit, Jimmie Dale could see contained a hypodermic syringe.  One more\narticle followed the other two–a letter, which Connie Myers took\nout of an unsealed envelope.  He dropped this suddenly on the table,\nas Mike Hagan, three feet away on the floor, groaned and sat up.",
        "Hagan’s eyes swept, bewildered, confused, around him, questioningly\nat Connie Myers–and then, resting suddenly on his bound wrists,\nthey narrowed menacingly.",
        "“Damn you, you smashed me with that sledge on PURPOSE!” he burst\nout–and began to struggle to his feet.",
        "With a brutal chuckle, Connie Myers pushed Hagan back and shoved his\nrevolver under the other’s nose.",
        "“Sure!” he admitted evenly.  “And you keep quiet, or I’ll finish you\nnow–instead of letting the police do it!”  He laughed out\njarringly.  “You’re under arrest, you know, for the murder of Luther\nDoyle, and for robbing the poor old nut of his savings in his house\nhere.”",
        "Hagan wrenched himself up on his elbow.",
        "“What–what do you mean?” he stammered.",
        "“Oh, don’t worry!” said Connie Myers maliciously.  “I’M not making\nthe arrest, I’d rather the police did that.  I’m not mixing up in\nit, and by and by\"–he lifted up the hypodermic for Hagan to see–\n\"I’m going to shoot a little dope into you that’ll keep you quiet\nwhile I get away myself.”",
        "Hagan’s face had gone a grayish white–he had caught sight of the\nmoney on the table, and his eyes kept shifting back and forth from\nit to Myers’ face.",
        "“Murder!” he said huskily.  “There is no murder.  I don’t know who\nDoyle is.  You said this house was yours–you hired me to come here.\nYou said you were going to tear down the fireplace and build\nanother.  You said I could work evenings and earn some extra money.”",
        "“Sure, I did!”  There was a vicious leer now on Connie Myers’ lips.\n\"But you don’t think I picked you out by ACCIDENT, do you?  Your\nreputation, my bucko, was just shady enough to satisfy anybody that\nit wouldn’t be beyond you to go the limit.  Sure, you murdered\nDoyle!  Listen to this.”  He took up the letter:",
        "“TO THE POLICE: Luther Doyle was murdered this evening in the\ntenement at 67 –– Street.  You’ll find his body in a room on the\nsecond floor.  If you want to know who did it, look in Mike Hagan’s\nroom on the floor above.  There’s a paper stuck under the edge of\nHagan’s table with a piece of chewing gum, where he hid it.  You’ll\nknow what it is when you go out and take a look at Doyle’s house in\nPelham.  Yours truly,  A FRIEND.”",
        "Mike Hagan did not speak–his lips were twitching, and there was\nhorror creeping into his eyes.",
        "“D’ye get me!” sneered Connie Myers.  “Tell your story–who’d\nbelieve it!  I got you cinched.  Twice I tried to get this old dub’s\ncoin out here, and couldn’t find it.  But the second time I found\nsomething else–a piece of paper with a drawing of the fireplace on\nit, and a place in the drawing marked with an X.  That was good\nenough, wasn’t it?  That’s the paper I stuck under your table this\nafternoon when your wife was out–see?  Somebody’s got to stand for\nthe job, and if it’s somebody else it won’t be me–get me!  When I\nhad a look at that fireplace I knew I couldn’t do the job alone in a\nweek, and I didn’t dare blast it with ’soup’ for fear of spoiling\nwhat was inside.  And since I had to have somebody to help me, I\nthought I might as well let him help me all the way through–and\nstand for it.  I picked you, Mike–that’s why I croaked old Doyle in\nyour tenement to-night.  I wrote this letter while I was waiting for\nyou to show up at the station to come out here with me, and I’m\ngoing to see that the police get it in the next hour.  When they\nfind Doyle in the room below yours, and that paper in your room, and\nthe busted fireplace here–I guess they won’t look any farther for\nwho did it.  And say\"–he leaned forward with an ugly grin–\"mabbe\nyou think I’m soft to be telling you all this?  But don’t you fool\nyourself.  You don’t know me–you don’t know who I am.  So tell ’em\nthe TRUTH!  They won’t believe you anyway with evidence like that\nagainst you–and the neater the story the more they’ll think it\nshows brains enough on your part to have pulled a job like this!”",
        "“My God!” Hagan was rocking on his knees, beads of sweat were\nstarting out on his forehead.  “You wouldn’t plant a man like that!\"\nhe cried brokenly.  “You wouldn’t do it, would you?  My God–you\nwouldn’t do that!”",
        "Jimmie Dale’s face under his mask was white and rigid.  There was\nsomething primal, elemental in the savagery that was sweeping upon\nhim.  He had it all now–ALL!  She had been right–there was need\nto-night for the Gray Seal.  So that was the game, inhuman, hellish,\nthe whole of it, to the last filthy dregs–Connie Myers, to protect\nhimself, was railroading an innocent man to death for the crime that\nhe himself had committed!  There was a cold smile on Jimmie Dale’s\nlips now, as he took his automatic from his pocket.  No, it wasn’t\nquite all the game–there was still HIS hand to play!  He edged\nforward a little nearer to the door–and halted abruptly, listening.\nAn automobile had stopped outside on the road.  Hagan was still\npleading in a frenzied way; Connie Myers was callously folding his\nletter, while he watched the other warily–neither of the men had\nheard the sound.",
        "And then, quick, almost on the instant, came a rush of feet, a crash\nupon the front door–an imperative command to open in the name of\nthe law.  THE POLICE!  Jimmie Dale’s brain was working now with\nlightning speed.  Somehow the police had stumbled upon the crime in\nthat tenement; and, as he had foreseen in such an event, had\nidentified Doyle.  But they could not be sure that any one was\npresent here in the house now–they could not see a light any more\nthan he had.  He must get Mike Hagan away–must see that Connie\nMyers did NOT get away.  Myers was on his feet now, fear struck in\nhis turn, the letter clutched in a tight-closed fist, his revolver\nswung out, poised, in the other hand.  Hagan, too, was on his feet,\nand, unheeded now by Connie Myers, was wrenching his wrists apart.",
        "Another crash upon the door–another.  Another demand in a harsh\nvoice to open it.  Then some one running around to the window at the\nside of the house–and Jimmie Dale sprang forward.",
        "There was the roar of a report, a blinding flash almost in Jimmie\nDale’s eyes, as Connie Myers, whirling instantly at his entrance,\nfired–and missed.  It happened quick then, in the space of the\nticking of a watch–before Jimmie Dale, flinging himself forward,\nhad reached the man.  Like a defiant challenge to their demand it\nmust have seemed to the officers outside, that shot of Connie Myers\nat Jimmie Dale, for it was answered on the instant by another\nthrough the side window.  And the shot, fired at random, the\ninterior of the room hidden from the officers outside by the drawn\nshades, found its mark–and Connie Myers, a bullet in his brain,\npitched forward, dead, upon the floor.",
        "“QUICK!” Jimmie Dale flung at Hagan.  “Get that letter out of his\nhand!”  He jumped for the lamp on the floor, extinguished it, and\nturned again toward Hagan.  “Have you got it?” he whispered tensely.",
        "“Yes,” said Hagan, in a numbed way.",
        "“This way, then!” Jimmie Dale caught Hagan’s arm, and pulled the\nother across the room and into the kitchen to the trapdoor.\n\"Quick!” he breathed again.  “Get down there–quick!  And no noise!\nThey don’t know how many are in the house.  When they find HIM\nthey’ll probably be satisfied.”",
        "Hagan, stupefied, dazed, obeyed mechanically–and, in an instant,\nthe trapdoor closed behind them, Jimmie Dale was standing beside the\nother in the cellar.",
        "“Not a sound now!” he cautioned once more.",
        "His flashlight winked, went out, winked again; then held steadily,\nin curious fascination it seemed, as, in its circuit, the ray fell\nupon Hagan–FELL UPON THE TORN, RAGGED EDGE OF A PAPER IN HAGAN’S\nHAND!  With a suppressed cry, Jimmie Dale snatched it away from the\nother.  It was but a torn HALF of the letter!  “The other half!  The\nother half, Hagan–where is it?” he demanded hoarsely.",
        "Hagan, almost in a state of collapse, muttered inaudibly.  The crash\nof a toppling door sounded from above.  Jimmie Dale shook the man\ndesperately.",
        "“Where is it?” he repeated fiercely.",
        "“He–he was holding it tight, it–it tore in his hand,” Hagan\nstammered.  “Does it make any difference?  Oh, let’s get out of\nhere, whoever you are–for God’s sake let’s get out of here!”",
        "Any difference!  Jimmie Dale’s jaws were clamped like a steel vise.\nAny difference!  The difference between life and death for the man\nbeside him–that was all!  He was reading the portion in his hand.\nIt was the last part of the letter, beginning with: “There’s a paper\nstuck under the edge of Hagan’s table–”  From above, from the floor\nof the front room now, came the rush and trample of feet.  He could\nnot go back for the other half.  And any attempt to conceal the fact\nthat Connie Myers had been alone in the house was futile now.  They\nwould find the torn letter in the dead man’s hand, proof enough that\nsome one else had been there.  What was in that part of the letter\nthat was still clutched in that death grip upstairs?  A sentence\nfrom it, that he had heard Connie Myers read, seemed to burn itself\ninto his brain.  “IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO DID IT, LOOK IN MIKE\nHAGAN’S ROOM ON THE FLOOR ABOVE.”  And then, suddenly, like light\nthrough the darkness, came a ray of hope.  He pulled Hagan to the\ncellarway, and stealthily lifted one side of the double trapdoor.\nThere was a chance, desperate enough, one in a thousand–but still a\nchance!",
        "Voices from the house came plainly now, but there was no one in\nsight.  The police, to a man, were evidently all inside.  From the\nroad in front showed the lamp glare of their automobile.",
        "“Run for the car!” Jimmie Dale jerked out from between set teeth–\nand with Hagan beside him, steadying the man by the arm, dashed\nacross the intervening fifty yards.",
        "They had not been seen.  A minute more, and the car, evidently\nbelonging to the local police, for it was headed in the direction of\nNew York, and as though it had come from Pelham, swept down the\nroad, swept around a turn, and Jimmie Dale, with a gasp of relief,\nstraightened up a little from the wheel.",
        "How much time had he?  The police must have heard the car; but,\nequally, occupied as they were, they might well give it no thought\nother than that it was but another car passing by.  There was no\ntelephone in the house; the nearest house was a quarter of a mile\naway, and that might or might not have a telephone.  Could he count\non half an hour?  He glanced anxiously at the crouched figure beside\nhim.  He would have to!  It was the only chance.  They would\ntelephone the contents of the dead man’s half of the letter to the\nNew York police.  Could he get to Hagan’s room FIRST!  “Look in\nHagan’s room,” their part of the letter read–but it did not say for\nWHAT, or exactly WHERE!  If they found nothing, Hagan was safe.\nConnie Myers’ reputation, the fact that he was found in disguise at\nDoyle’s house, was, barring any incriminating evidence, quite enough\nto let Hagan out.  There would only remain in the minds of the\npolice the question of who, beside Connie Myers, had been in old\nDoyle’s house that night?  And now Jimmie Dale smiled a little\nwhimsically.  Well, perhaps he could answer that–and, if not quite\nto the satisfaction of the police, at least to the complete\nvindication of Mike Hagan.",
        "But he could not drive through towns and villages with a mask on his\nface; and there, ahead now, lights were beginning to show.  And more\nthan ever now, with what was before him, it was imperative that Mike\nHagan should not recognise Larry the Bat.  Jimmie Dale glanced again\nat Hagan–and slowed down the car.  They were on the outskirts of a\ntown, and off to the right he caught the twinkling lights of a\nstreet car.",
        "“Hagan,” he said sharply, “pull yourself together, and listen to me!\nIf you keep your mouth shut, you’ve nothing to fear; if you let out\na word of what’s happened to-night, you’ll probably go to the chair\nfor a crime you know nothing about.  Do you understand?–keep your\nmouth shut!”",
        "The car had stopped.  Hagan nodded his head.",
        "“All right, then.  You get out here, and take a street car into New\nYork,” continued Jimmie Dale crisply.  “But when you get there, keep\naway from your home for the next two or three hours.  Hang around\nwith some of the boys you know, and if you’re asked anything\nafterward, say you were batting around town all evening.  Don’t\nworry–you’ll find you’re out of this when you read the morning\npapers.  Now get out–hurry!”  He pushed Hagan from the car.  “I’ve\ngot to make my own get-away.”",
        "Hagan, standing in the road, brushed his hand bewilderingly across\nhis eyes.",
        "“Yes–but you–I–”",
        "“Never mind about that!” Jimmie Dale leaned out, and gripped Hagan’s\narm impressively.  “There’s only one thing you’ve got to think of,\nor remember.  Keep your mouth shut!  No matter what happens, keep\nyour mouth shut–if you want to save your neck!  Good-night, Hagan!”",
        "The car was racing forward again.  It shot streaking through the\nstreets of the town ahead, and, dully, over its own inferno, echoed\nshouts, cries, and execrations of an outraged populace–then out\ninto the night again, roaring its way toward New York.",
        "He had half an hour–perhaps!  It was a good thing Hagan did not\nknow, or had not grasped the significance of that torn letter–the\nman would have been unmanageable with fear and excitement.  It would\npuzzle Hagan to find no paper stuck under his table when he came to\nlook for it!  But that was a minor consideration, that mattered not\nat all,",
        "Half an hour!  On roared the car–towns, black roads, villages,\nwooded lands were kaleidoscopic in their passing.  Half an hour!\nHad he done it?  Had he come anywhere near doing it?  He did not\nknow.  He was in the city at last–and now he had to moderate his\nspeed; but, by keeping to the less frequented streets, he could\nstill drive at a fast pace.  One piece of good fortune had been his–\nthe long motor coat he had found in the car with which to cover the\nrags of Larry the Bat, and without which he would have been obliged\nto leave the car somewhere on the outskirts of the city, and to\ntrust, like Mike Hagan, to other and slower means of transportation.",
        "Blocks away from Hagan’s tenement, he ran the car into a lane,\nslipped off the motor coat, and from his pocket whipped out the\nlittle metal insignia case–and in another moment a diamond-shaped\ngray seal was neatly affixed to the black ebony rim of the steering\nwheel.  He smiled ironically.  It was necessary, quite necessary\nthat the police should have no doubt as to who had been in Doyle’s\nhouse with Connie Myers that night, or to whom they had so\nconsiderately loaned their automobile!",
        "He was running now–through lanes, dodging down side streets, taking\nevery short cut he knew.  Had he beaten the police to Mike Hagan’s\nroom?  It would be easy then.  If they were ahead of him, then, by\nsome means or other, he must still get that paper first.",
        "He was at the tenement now–shuffling leisurely up the steps.  The\nfront door was open.  He entered, and went up the first flight of\nstairs, then along the hall, and up the next flight.  He had half\nexpected the place to be bustling with excitement over the crime;\nbut the police evidently had kept the affair quiet, for he had seen\nno one since he had entered.  But now, as he began to mount the\nthird flight, he went more slowly–some one was ahead of him.  It\nwas very dark–he could not see.  The steps above died away.  He\nreached the landing, started along for Hagan’s room–and a light\nblazed suddenly in his face, and a hard, quick grip on his shoulder\nforced him back against the wall.  Then the flashlight wavered,\nglistened on brass buttons went out, and a voice laughed roughly:",
        "“It’s only Larry the Bat!”",
        "“Larry the Bat, eh?”  It was another voice, harsh and curt.  “What\nare you doing here?”",
        "He was not first, after all!  The telephone message from Pelham–it\nwas almost certainly that–had beaten him!  They were ahead of him,\njust ahead of him, they had only been a few steps ahead of him going\nup the stairs, just a second ahead of him on their way to Hagan’s\nroom!  Jimmie Dale was thinking fast now.  He must go, too–to\nHagan’s room with them–somehow–there was no other way–there was\nHagan’s life at stake.",
        "“Aw, I ain’t done nothin’!” he whined.  “I was just goin’ ter borrow\nthe price of a feed from Mike Hagan–lemme go!”",
        "“Hagan, eh!” snapped the questioner.  “Are you a friend of his?”",
        "“Sure, I am!”",
        "The officers whispered for a moment together.",
        "“We’ll try it,” decided the one who appeared to be in command.\n\"We’re in the dark, anyhow, and the thing may be only a steer.\nMabbe it’ll work–anyway, it won’t do any harm.”  His hand fell\nheavily on Jimmie Dale’s shoulder.  “Mrs. Hagan know you?\"\nbrusquely.",
        "“Sure she does!” sniffled Larry the Bat.",
        "“Good!” rasped the officer.  “Well, we’ll make the visit with you.\nAnd you do what you’re told, or we’ll put the screws on you–see?\nWe’re after something here, and you’ve blown the whole game–savvy?\nYou’ve spilled the gravy–understand?”",
        "In the darkness, Jimmie Dale smiled grimly.  It was far more than he\nhad dared to hope for–they were playing into his hands!",
        "“But I don’t know ’bout any game,” grovelled Larry the Bat\npiteously.",
        "“Who in hell said you did!” growled the officer.  “You’re supposed\nto have snitched the lay to us, that’s all–and mind you play your\npart!  Come on!”",
        "It was two doors down the hall to Mike Hagan’s room, and there one\nof the officers, putting his shoulder to the door, burst it open and\nsprang in.  The other shoved Jimmie Dale forward.  It was quickly\ndone.  The three were in the room.  The door was closed again.",
        "Came a cry of terror out of the darkness, a movement as of some one\nrising up hurriedly in bed; and then Mrs. Hagan’s voice:",
        "“What is it!  Who is it!  Mike!”",
        "The table–it was against the right-hand wall, Jimmie Date\nremembered.  He sidled quickly toward it.",
        "“Strike a light!” ordered the officer in charge.",
        "Jimmie Dale’s fingers were feeling under the edge of the table–a\nquick sweep along it–NOTHING!  He stooped, reaching farther in–\nanother sweep of his arm–and his fingers closed on a sheet of paper\nand a piece of hard gum.  In an instant they were in his pocket.",
        "A match crackled and flared up.  A lamp was lighted.  Larry the Bat\nsulked sullenly against the wall.",
        "Terror-stricken, wide-eyed, Mrs. Hagan had clutched the child lying\nbeside her to her arms, and was sitting bolt upright in bed.",
        "“Now then, no fuss about it!” said the officer in charge, with\nbrutal directness.  “You might as well make a clean breast of Mike’s\nshare in that murder downstairs–Larry the Bat, here, has already\ntold us the whole story.  Come on, now–out with it!”",
        "“Murder!\"–her face went white.  “My Mike– MURDER!”  She seemed for\nan instant stunned–and then down the worn, thin, haggard face\ngushed the tears.  “I don’t believe it!” she cried.  “I don’t\nbelieve it!”",
        "“Come on now, cut that out!” prodded the officer roughly.  “I tell\nyou Larry the Bat, here, has opened everything up wide.  You’re only\nmaking it worse for yourself.”",
        "“Him!”  She was staring now at Jimmie Dale.  “Oh, God!” she cried.\n\"So that’s what you are, are you–a stool-pigeon for the cops?\nWell, whatever you told them, you lie!  You’re the curse of this\nneighbourhood, you are, and if my Mike is bad at all, it’s you\nthat’s helped to make him bad.  But murder–you LIE!”",
        "She had risen slowly from the bed–a gaunt, pitiful figure,\npitifully clothed, the black hair, gray-streaked, streaming thinly\nover her shoulders, still clutching the baby that, too, was crying\nnow.",
        "The officers looked at one another and nodded.",
        "“Guess she’s handing it straight–we’ll have a look on our own\nhook,” the leader muttered.",
        "She paid no attention to them–she was walking straight to Jimmie\nDale.",
        "“It’s you, is it,” she whispered fiercely through her sobs “that\nwould bring more shame and ruin here–you that’s selling my man’s\nlife away with your filthy lies for what they’re paying you–it’s\nyou, is it, that–”  Her voice broke.",
        "There was a frightened, uneasy look in Larry the Bat’s eyes, his\nlips were twitching weakly, he drew far back against the wall–and\nthen, glancing miserably at the officers, as though entreating their\npermission, began to edge toward the door.",
        "For a moment she watched him, her face white with outrage, her hand\nclenched at her side–and then she found her voice again.",
        "“Get out of here!” she said, in a choked, strained way pointing to\nthe door.  “Get out of here–you dirty skate!”",
        "“Sure!” mumbled Larry the Bat, his eyes on the floor.  “Sure!” he\nmumbled–and the door closed behind him.",
