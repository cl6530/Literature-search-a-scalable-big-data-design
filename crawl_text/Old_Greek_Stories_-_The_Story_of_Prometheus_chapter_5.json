        "In those old, old times, there lived two brothers who were not like\nother men, nor yet like those Mighty Ones who lived upon the mountain\ntop. They were the sons of one of those Titans who had fought against\nJupiter and been sent in chains to the strong prison-house of the Lower\nWorld.",
        "The name of the elder of these brothers was Prometheus, or Forethought;\nfor he was always thinking of the future and making things ready for\nwhat might happen to-morrow, or next week, or next year, or it may be in\na hundred years to come. The younger was called Epimetheus, or\nAfterthought; for he was always so busy thinking of yesterday, or last\nyear, or a hundred years ago, that he had no care at all for what might\ncome to pass after a while.",
        "For some cause Jupiter had not sent these brothers to prison with the\nrest of the Titans.",
        "Prometheus did not care to live amid the clouds on the mountain top. He\nwas too busy for that. While the Mighty Folk were spending their time in\nidleness, drinking nectar and eating ambrosia, he was intent upon plans\nfor making the world wiser and better than it had ever been before.",
        "He went out amongst men to live with them and help them; for his heart\nwas filled with sadness when he found that they were no longer happy as\nthey had been during the golden days when Saturn was king. Ah, how very\npoor and wretched they were! He found them living in caves and in holes\nof the earth, shivering with the cold because there was no fire, dying\nof starvation, hunted by wild beasts and by one another–the most\nmiserable of all living creatures.",
        "“If they only had fire,” said Prometheus to himself, “they could at\nleast warm themselves and cook their food; and after a while they could\nlearn to make tools and build themselves houses. Without fire, they are\nworse off than the beasts.”",
        "Then he went boldly to Jupiter and begged him to give fire to men, that\nso they might have a little comfort through the long, dreary months of\nwinter.",
        "“Not a spark will I give,” said Jupiter. “No, indeed! Why, if men had\nfire they might become strong and wise like ourselves, and after a while\nthey would drive us out of our kingdom. Let them shiver with cold, and\nlet them live like the beasts. It is best for them to be poor and\nignorant, that so we Mighty Ones may thrive and be happy.”",
        "Prometheus made no answer; but he had set his heart on helping mankind,\nand he did not give up. He turned away, and left Jupiter and his mighty\ncompany forever.",
        "As he was walking by the shore of the sea he found a reed, or, as some\nsay, a tall stalk of fennel, growing; and when he had broken it off he\nsaw that its hollow center was filled with a dry, soft pith which would\nburn slowly and keep on fire a long time. He took the long stalk in his\nhands, and started with it towards the dwelling of the sun in the far\neast.",
        "“Mankind shall have fire in spite of the tyrant who sits on the mountain\ntop,” he said.",
        "He reached the place of the sun in the early morning just as the\nglowing, golden orb was rising from the earth and beginning his daily\njourney through the sky. He touched the end of the long reed to the\nflames, and the dry pith caught on fire and burned slowly. Then he\nturned and hastened back to his own land, carrying with him the precious\nspark hidden in the hollow center of the plant.",
        "He called some of the shivering men from their caves and built a fire\nfor them, and showed them how to warm themselves by it and how to build\nother fires from the coals. Soon there was a cheerful blaze in every\nrude home in the land, and men and women gathered round it and were warm\nand happy, and thankful to Prometheus for the wonderful gift which he\nhad brought to them from the sun.",
        "It was not long until they learned to cook their food and so to eat like\nmen instead of like beasts. They began at once to leave off their wild\nand savage habits; and instead of lurking in the dark places of the\nworld, they came out into the open air and the bright sunlight, and were\nglad because life had been given to them.",
        "After that, Prometheus taught them, little by little, a thousand things.\nHe showed them how to build houses of wood and stone, and how to tame\nsheep and cattle and make them useful, and how to plow and sow and reap,\nand how to protect themselves from the storms of winter and the beasts\nof the woods. Then he showed them how to dig in the earth for copper and\niron, and how to melt the ore, and how to hammer it into shape and\nfashion from it the tools and weapons which they needed in peace and\nwar; and when he saw how happy the world was becoming he cried out:",
        "“A new Golden Age shall come, brighter and better by far than the old!”",
        "Things might have gone on very happily indeed, and the Golden Age might\nreally have come again, had it not been for Jupiter. But one day, when\nhe chanced to look down upon the earth, he saw the fires burning, and\nthe people living in houses, and the flocks feeding on the hills, and\nthe grain ripening in the fields, and this made him very angry.",
        "“Who has done all this?” he asked.",
        "And some one answered, “Prometheus!”",
        "“What! that young Titan!” he cried. “Well, I will punish him in a way\nthat will make him wish I had shut him up in the prison-house with his\nkinsfolk. But as for those puny men, let them keep their fire. I will\nmake them ten times more miserable than they were before they had it.”",
        "Of course it would be easy enough to deal with Prometheus at any time,\nand so Jupiter was in no great haste about it. He made up his mind to\ndistress mankind first; and he thought of a plan for doing it in a very\nstrange, roundabout way.",
        "In the first place, he ordered his blacksmith Vulcan, whose forge was in\nthe crater of a burning mountain, to take a lump of clay which he gave\nhim, and mold it into the form of a woman. Vulcan did as he was bidden;\nand when he had finished the image, he carried it up to Jupiter, who\nwas sitting among the clouds with all the Mighty Folk around him. It was\nnothing but a mere lifeless body, but the great blacksmith had given it\na form more perfect than that of any statue that has ever been made.",
        "“Come now!” said Jupiter, “let us all give some goodly gift to this\nwoman;” and he began by giving her life.",
        "Then the others came in their turn, each with a gift for the marvelous\ncreature. One gave her beauty; and another a pleasant voice; and another\ngood manners; and another a kind heart; and another skill in many arts;\nand, lastly, some one gave her curiosity. Then they called her Pandora,\nwhich means the all-gifted, because she had received gifts from them\nall.",
        "Pandora was so beautiful and so wondrously gifted that no one could help\nloving her. When the Mighty Folk had admired her for a time, they gave\nher to Mercury, the light-footed; and he led her down the mountain side\nto the place where Prometheus and his brother were living and toiling\nfor the good of mankind. He met Epimetheus first, and said to him:",
        "“Epimetheus, here is a beautiful woman, whom Jupiter has sent to you to\nbe your wife.”",
        "Prometheus had often warned his brother to beware of any gift that\nJupiter might send, for he knew that the mighty tyrant could not be\ntrusted; but when Epimetheus saw Pandora, how lovely and wise she was,\nhe forgot all warnings, and took her home to live with him and be his\nwife.",
        "Pandora was very happy in her new home; and even Prometheus, when he saw\nher, was pleased with her loveliness. She had brought with her a golden\ncasket, which Jupiter had given her at parting, and which he had told\nher held many precious things; but wise Athena, the queen of the air,\nhad warned her never, never to open it, nor look at the things inside.",
        "“They must be jewels,” she said to herself; and then she thought of how\nthey would add to her beauty if only she could wear them. “Why did\nJupiter give them to me if I should never use them, nor so much as look\nat them?” she asked.",
        "The more she thought about the golden casket, the more curious she was\nto see what was in it; and every day she took it down from its shelf and\nfelt of the lid, and tried to peer inside of it without opening it.",
        "“Why should I care for what Athena told me?” she said at last. “She is\nnot beautiful, and jewels would be of no use to her. I think that I will\nlook at them, at any rate. Athena will never know. Nobody else will\never know.”",
        "She opened the lid a very little, just to peep inside. All at once there\nwas a whirring, rustling sound, and before she could shut it down again,\nout flew ten thousand strange creatures with death-like faces and gaunt\nand dreadful forms, such as nobody in all the world had ever seen. They\nfluttered for a little while about the room, and then flew away to find\ndwelling-places wherever there were homes of men. They were diseases and\ncares; for up to that time mankind had not had any kind of sickness, nor\nfelt any troubles of mind, nor worried about what the morrow might bring\nforth.",
        "These creatures flew into every house, and, without any one seeing them,\nnestled down in the bosoms of men and women and children, and put an end\nto all their joy; and ever since that day they have been flitting and\ncreeping, unseen and unheard, over all the land, bringing pain and\nsorrow and death into every household.",
        "If Pandora had not shut down the lid so quickly, things would have gone\nmuch worse. But she closed it just in time to keep the last of the evil\ncreatures from getting out. The name of this creature was Foreboding,\nand although he was almost half out of the casket, Pandora pushed him\nback and shut the lid so tight that he could never escape. If he had\ngone out into the world, men would have known from childhood just what\ntroubles were going to come to them every day of their lives, and they\nwould never have had any joy or hope so long as they lived.",
        "And this was the way in which Jupiter sought to make mankind more\nmiserable than they had been before Prometheus had befriended them.",
        "The next thing that Jupiter did was to punish Prometheus for stealing\nfire from the sun. He bade two of his servants, whose names were\nStrength and Force, to seize the bold Titan and carry him to the topmost\npeak of the Caucasus Mountains. Then he sent the blacksmith Vulcan to\nbind him with iron chains and fetter him to the rocks so that he could\nnot move hand or foot.",
        "Vulcan did not like to do this, for he was a friend of Prometheus, and\nyet he did not dare to disobey. And so the great friend of men, who had\ngiven them fire and lifted them out of their wretchedness and shown them\nhow to live, was chained to the mountain peak; and there he hung, with\nthe storm-winds whistling always around him, and the pitiless hail\nbeating in his face, and fierce eagles shrieking in his ears and tearing\nhis body with their cruel claws. Yet he bore all his sufferings without\na groan, and never would he beg for mercy or say that he was sorry for\nwhat he had done.",
        "Year after year, and age after age, Prometheus hung there. Now and then\nold Helios, the driver of the sun car, would look down upon him and\nsmile; now and then flocks of birds would bring him messages from\nfar-off lands; once the ocean nymphs came and sang wonderful songs in\nhis hearing; and oftentimes men looked up to him with pitying eyes, and\ncried out against the tyrant who had placed him there.",
        "Then, once upon a time, a white cow passed that way,–a strangely\nbeautiful cow, with large sad eyes and a face that seemed almost human.\nShe stopped and looked up at the cold gray peak and the giant body which\nwas chained there. Prometheus saw her and spoke to her kindly:",
        "“I know who you are,” he said. “You are Io who was once a fair and happy\nmaiden in distant Argos; and now, because of the tyrant Jupiter and his\njealous queen, you are doomed to wander from land to land in that\nunhuman form. But do not lose hope. Go on to the southward and then to\nthe west; and after many days you shall come to the great river Nile.\nThere you shall again become a maiden, but fairer and more beautiful\nthan before; and you shall become the wife of the king of that land, and\nshall give birth to a son, from whom shall spring the hero who will\nbreak my chains and set me free. As for me, I bide in patience the day\nwhich not even Jupiter can hasten or delay. Farewell!”",
        "Poor Io would have spoken, but she could not. Her sorrowful eyes looked\nonce more at the suffering hero on the peak, and then she turned and\nbegan her long and tiresome journey to the land of the Nile.",
        "Ages passed, and at last a great hero whose name was Hercules came to\nthe land of the Caucasus. In spite of Jupiter’s dread thunderbolts and\nfearful storms of snow and sleet, he climbed the rugged mountain peak;\nhe slew the fierce eagles that had so long tormented the helpless\nprisoner on those craggy heights; and with a mighty blow, he broke the\nfetters of Prometheus and set the grand old hero free.",
        "“I knew that you would come,” said Prometheus. “Ten generations ago I\nspoke of you to Io, who was afterwards the queen of the land of the\nNile.”",
        "“And Io,” said Hercules, “was the mother of the race from which I am\nsprung.”",
