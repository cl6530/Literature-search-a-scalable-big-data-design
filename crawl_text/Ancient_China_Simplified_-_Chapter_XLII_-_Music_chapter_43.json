        "In these pictures of ancient Chinese life which we are\nendeavouring to present, the idea is to repeat from every point of\nview the main characteristics of that life, so that a strange and\nunfamiliar subject, very loosely depicted in the straggling annals\nof antiquity, may receive fresh rays of light from every possible\nquarter, and thus stand out clearer as a connected whole.",
        "Take, for instance, the subject of music, which always played in\nChinese ceremonial a prominent part not easy for us now to\nunderstand. One of the chief sights of the modern Confucian\nresidence is the music-room, containing specimens of all the\nancient musical instruments, which, on occasion, are still played\nupon in chorus; a picture of them has been published by Father\nTschepe. (See page 128.) According to the description given by\nthis European visitor, the music is of a most discordant and ear-\nsplitting description: but that does not necessarily dispose of\nthe question; for even parts of Wagner’s Ring are a meaningless\nclang to those who hear the music for the first time, and who are\nunable to read the score or to follow out the “classical\" style.\nAs we have said before, the ancient emperors, at their banquets\ngiven to vassals and others, always had musical accompaniment.",
        "In 626 B.C., when the ruler of Ts’in received a mission from “the\nTartar king” (probably a local king or chief), he was much struck\nwith the sagacity of the envoy sent to him. This envoy still spoke\nthe Tsin language or dialect; but his parents, who were of Tsin\norigin, had adopted Tartar manners. The envoy was also an author,\nand his work, in two sections, had survived at least up to the\nsecond century B.C.: he is classed amongst the “Miscellaneous\nWriters.” The subject of the conversation was the superiority of\nsimple Tartar administration as compared with the intricate ritual\nof the Odes, the Book, the Rites, and the “Music” of orthodox\nChina. The beginnings of Lao-tsz’s Taoism seem to peep out from\nthis Tartar’s words, just as they do with other “Miscellaneous\"\nauthors. The wily Ts’in ruler, in order to secure this clever\nenvoy for his own service, sent two bands of female musicians as a\npresent to the Tartar king, so as to make him less virile; 140\nyears later the cunning ruler of Ts’i did much the same thing in\norder to prevent the Duke of Lu from growing too strong; and the\nimmediate consequence was that Confucius left his fickle master in\ndisgust. Ki-chah, Prince of Wu, was entertained whilst at Lu with\nspecimens of music from the different states. When he came to the\nTs’in music, he said: “Ha! ha! the words are Chinese! When Ts’in\nbecomes quite Chinese, it will have a great future.” This remark\nsuggests a Ts’in language or dialect different from that of Tsin,\nand also from that of more orthodox China. In 546 B.C., when a\nmission from Ts ’u to Tsin was accompanied by a high officer from\nthe disputed orthodox state of Ts’ai lying between those two great\npowers, the theory of music as an adjunct to government was\ndiscussed. Confucius’ view a century later was that music best\nreflected a nation’s manners, and that in good old times authority\nwas manifested quite as much in rites and ceremonies as in laws\nand pronouncements. Previous to that, in 582, it had been\ndiscovered that Ts’u had a musical style of her own; and in 579,\nwhen the Tsin envoy was received there in state, among other\ninstruments of music observed there were suspended bells.",
        "Thus both Ts’in and Ts’u at this date were still in the learning\nstage. Before ridiculing the idea that music could in any way\nserve as a substitute for preaching or commanding, we must reflect\nupon the awe-inspiring contribution of music to our own religious\nservices, not to mention the “speaking” effect of our Western\nnocturnes, symphonies, and operatic music generally.",
        "In 562 B.C., when a statesman of Tsin (whose fame in this\nconnection endures to our own days) succeeded in establishing a\npermanent understanding with the Tartars, based upon joint trading\nrights and reasonable mutual concessions, the principle of\ninteresting the Tartars in cultivation, industry, and so on; as a\nreward for his distinguished services, he was presented with\ncertain music, which meant that he had the political right to have\ncertain musical airs performed in his presence. This concession\nceases to seem ridiculous or even strange to us if we reflect what\nan honour it would have been to, say, the Duke of Wellington, or\nto Nelson, had the right to play “God Save the King” at dinner\nbeen granted to his family band of musicians. Four centuries\nbefore this, when the Emperor Muh made his tour amongst the\nTartars, he always commanded that one particular musical air\n(named) should be struck up by his musicians on certain occasions\n(always stated in the narrative). In Tsin, and probably elsewhere,\nmusic-masters seem to have combined soothsaying and philosophy\nwith their functions; thus, in 558 the music-master of that state\nwas questioned on the arts of good government, to which he\nreplied: “Goodness and justice\"–two special antipathies, by the\nway, of Lao-tsz the Taoist, who lived about this time as an\narchive-keeper at the metropolis. In the year 555, either this\nsame man or another musical prophet in Tsin reassured his fellow-\ncountrymen who were dreading a Ts’u invasion with the following\nwords: “I have just been conducting a song consisting of north and\nsouth airs, and the latter sound as though the south would be\ndefeated.” But music also had its lighter uses, for we have seen\nin Chapter VI. how in 549 two Tsin generals took their ease in a\ncomfortable cart, playing the banjo, whilst passing through Cheng\nto attack Ts’u. Music was used at worship as well as at court; in\n527 the ruler of Lu, as a mark of respect for one of his deceased\nministers, abandoned the playing of music, which otherwise would\nhave been a constituent part of the sacrifice or worship he had in\nhand at the moment. Even in modern China, music is prohibited\nduring solemn periods of mourning, and officials are often\ndegraded for attending theatrical performances on solemn fasts. In\n212 B.C., when the First August Emperor was, like Saul or\nBelshazzar, beginning to grow sad at the contemplation of his\nlonely and unloved greatness, he was suddenly startled at the fall\nof a meteoric stone, bearing upon it what looked like a warning\ninscription. He at once ordered his learned men to compose some\nmusic treating of “true men” and immortals, in order to exorcise\nthe evil omen; it may be mentioned that this emperor’s Taoist\nproclivities have apparently had the indirect result that the word\n“true man” has come century by century down to us, with the\nmeaning of “Taoist priest,” or “Taoist inspired person.”",
