        "The ascent to Paradise was accomplished by a fixed gaze into Beatrice’s\neyes, by which Dante, like Glaucus, was made divine, and by which he was\nlifted, with incredible swiftness, through the heavens. As soon as he had\nfixed his eyes on Beatrice’s, who in turn looked towards heaven, they\nfound themselves in the Heaven of the Moon, whose luminous yet pearl-like\nlight enfolded them. While Beatrice was explaining to him that the spots\non the moon were not caused by the varying degrees of atmospheric density,\nas he had supposed, but by the Divine Virtue infused in divine measure\nthrough the angelic dwellers in the first heaven, he met Piccarda, his\nsister-in-law, whose brother, Corso Donati, had torn her from her convent\nto wed her to Rosselin della Tosa, soon after which she died. Here also\nwas Costanza, daughter of Roger I. of Sicily, grandmother of that Manfredi\nwhom he had seen in Purgatory. Here Beatrice instructed Dante as to the\nimperfection of those wills that held not to their vows, but allowed\nviolence to thwart them.",
        "Another look into the smiling eyes, and the two were in the Heaven of\nMercury, where those wills abide in whom love of fame partly extinguished\nlove of God. One of the thousand splendors that advanced towards them was\nthe soul of the Emperor Justinian, who reviewed the Empire, the Church,\ncondemning severely the behavior of the Guelphs and Ghibellines, and told\nof the spirits who inhabited the little planet, whose lives were sweetened\nby living justice, and whose ears were gladdened by the sweetest\nharmonies.",
        "Dante was unaware of his ascent into, Venus, where dwelt those souls who\nwere lovers on earth, until he perceived Beatrice’s added beauty. Amid\nrevolving lights Charles Martel of Hungary appeared, denounced his brother\nRobert of Sicily, and instructed Dante on the subjects of heredity and\ndegeneracy; that “sweet seed can come bitter” because the influence of the\nstar under which the child is born can counteract that of the parent, and\nbecause his state is not always adapted to him by his parents and\nadvisers.",
        "In the sphere of the Sun, consecrated to the great doctors of divinity,\nBeatrice became still more beautiful; but so absorbed was the poet in the\nlove for the Eternal Source of all this splendor that for the first time\nhe forgot her. Out of the whirling lights, shining like precious jewels,\ncame Saint Thomas Aquinas, who pointed out to Dante his noted companions,\nGratian, Peter Lombard, Solomon, Dionysius, Boethius, and Baeda. Thomas\nthen related the story of Saint Francis of Assisi and the founding of his\norder of the Franciscans, upon which Saint Bonaventura of the Franciscans,\nfrom the next flame garland, told of Saint Dominic and the Dominican\norder. Alas! while both orders were great in the beginning, both narrators\nhad to censure their present corruption.",
        "The array of brilliant lights, dividing itself, formed into two disks\nwhich, revolving oppositely, sang the praises of the Trinity. The song of\npraise finished, Saint Thomas explained that Solomon was elevated to this\nsphere for his wisdom and his regal prudence, and warned Dante against the\nerror of rash judgment.",
        "The splendor of Mars was almost blinding; it was ruddier than the others,\nand in it dwelt the souls of the crusaders and martyrs. While Dante’s ears\nwere ravished by exquisite music, his eyes were dazzled by the lights,\nwhich had arranged themselves in the form of a cross. From out the\nsplendor, one star saluted Dante. It was the soul of his ancestor\nCacciaguida, who had waited long for the coming of his descendant. He\nrelated to Dante the story of his life, commenting on the difference\nbetween the simple life of the Florentines of his day and the corrupt\npractices of Dante’s time, and broke to the poet what had already been\ndarkly hinted to him in Hell and Purgatory,–his banishment; how he must\ndepart from Florence and learn how salt is the bread of charity, how\nwearisome the stairs in the abode of the stranger.",
        "As Cacciaguida ceased and pointed out the other well-known dwellers in\nMars, each one on the cross flashed as his name was called,–Joshua, Judas\nMaccabeus, Charlemagne and Roland, Godfrey of Bouillon, Robert Guiscard,\nand others.",
        "In Jupiter, whose whiteness contrasted with the ruddiness of Mars, dwelt\nthe souls of great rulers, certain of whom arranged themselves first to\nform the golden letters of Diligite Justitiam qui judicatis terram(\"Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth”), and then formed\nthemselves into the Roman eagle and sang of the justice and mercy that\ncaused their elevation to this position, and of events about to occur in\nhistory.",
        "Had Beatrice smiled as they ascended to Saturn, Dante would have perished\nas did Semele, from excess of light. In Saturn dwelt the spirits of the\ncontemplative, the monks and hermits, and here was Jacob’s ladder, up and\ndown whose bars of gold sparkled the spirits of the saints, silent for the\nsame reason that Beatrice smiled not. By divine election, Saint Peter\nDamian descended and spoke with Dante, accusing the churchmen of the time\nof worldliness and luxury. “Cephas and our Lord came on earth barefoot and\npoorly clad, but these men are covered with gorgeous raiment and ride upon\nsleek palfreys.” As he closed, a thunder cry of approval went up from the\nother saints.",
        "Up the wonderful ladder passed Dante and his lady into the eighth heaven\nof the Fixed Stars, and looking down saw the little earth and the starry\nheavens through which they had passed. Then, as Beatrice paused with her\nface all aflame, and her eyes full of ecstasy, down came the hosts of\nChrist’s triumphal march, and within the living light, which dazzled\nDante’s eyes until he could not see, also appeared Mary, mother of God,\ncrowned by Gabriel, rising into the Empyrean. Of those who remained\nbehind, Beatrice asked that Dante be sprinkled with the waters of the\nliving Fountain; and while they gave their consent, Saint Peter appeared\nas a fire whirling ecstatically, and singing a divine song. He examined\nthe trembling poet on faith, and his questions being answered\nsatisfactorily, encircled him thrice with his light. Saint James, who next\ncame forth, was likewise pleased with his response on Hope, and he was\nthen blinded by the effulgence of John, so that for a time he could not\nsee the face of his lady.",
        "Of Love he spoke with John, and then talked with Adam. As he listened to\nthe strains of richest melody, he noticed one of the lights–Saint\nPeter–change from white to red, and then, as silence fell, speak, enraged\nat the worldliness of the Holy See. “My cemetery has been made a sewer of\nblood and stench. When thou returnest to earth, reveal what thou hast\nheard. Do not thou conceal what I have not concealed.”",
        "Commanded by Beatrice, Dante looked back at earth once more, and as he\nlooked, was carried up into the heaven of the Primum Mobile, where dwelt\nthe moral philosophers. Here the angelic spirits circled round the point\nof intense light, the divine centre. The nearer God was the circle, the\ngreater virtue it possessed. This order was inverse to that of the\nheavens, but Dante learned from Beatrice that the orbs revolved through\nnarrow paths or wide according to the virtue of their parts, and that a\nstrict agreement of harmony prevailed between the great and the small. The\nangel and the heavens were created simultaneously, and, as direct\nemanations from God, know no decay. Of this and many things concerning the\nCreation, did Beatrice enlighten Dante before the beauty of her smile told\nhim that they were in the Empyrean. “Now shall thou look upon the mighty\nhosts of Paradise.”",
        "The poet’s dazzled eyes saw then a river of light from which issued living\nsparks sunk down into the flowers like rubies set in gold. Instructed by\nBeatrice he drank of the stream and the river changed into a lake; then he\nsaw the Courts of Heaven made manifest, and the splendor of God. The ample\nRose unfolded its leaves before him, breathing praise and perfume, and as\nhe gazed into it Beatrice pointed out the radiant spirits and the thronged\nseats, one of which was reserved for the Emperor Henry of Luxembourg, from\nwhom Dante expected so much, and who died before aught was accomplished.\nAs Dante gazed, the hosts with wings of gold and faces of living flame,\nsinging anthems, alternately sank into the Rose, like a swarm of bees\nsinking into summer flowers, and rose again to view the Divine splendor.\nTurning to question Beatrice again, Dante found in her place Saint Bernard\nof Clairvaux, an old man full of the tenderest pity, who pointed out to\nhim Beatrice in her own place, the third round of the first rank. As from\nafar, Dante pleaded with the beautiful lady who had left her place in\nheaven to go even unto the gates of hell for his sake, to aid him still;\nshe seemed to smile upon him before she again turned her gaze upon the\nEternal Fountain of Light. Saint Bernard explained to the poet the\ndivisions of the Rose and the seats of the saints, and then addressed a\nprayer to the Virgin, asking that Dante be permitted to look upon the\nAlmighty Father. As he prayed, Beatrice and all the blessed ones clasped\ntheir hands to her who likes so well prayers of divine fervor. At a\ngesture from Bernard, the poet looked upward. Then what a radiant vision\nmet his eyes! Three circles he saw of threefold color and one dimension.\nAs he looked, one seemed to take our image, and again was lost in the\ninfinite glory of the Light Divine. As he tried to describe it,\nimagination failed him, though his will remained, moving on with the even\nmotion of the sun and stars.",
