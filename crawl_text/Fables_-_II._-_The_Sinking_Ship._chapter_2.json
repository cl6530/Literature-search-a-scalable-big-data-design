        "“SIR,” said the first lieutenant, bursting into the Captain’s \ncabin, “the ship is going down.”",
        "“Very well, Mr. Spoker,” said the Captain; “but that is no reason \nfor going about half-shaved.  Exercise your mind a moment, Mr. \nSpoker, and you will see that to the philosophic eye there is \nnothing new in our position: the ship (if she is to go down at all) \nmay be said to have been going down since she was launched.”",
        "“She is settling fast,” said the first lieutenant, as he returned \nfrom shaving.",
        "“Fast, Mr. Spoker?” asked the Captain.  “The expression is a \nstrange one, for time (if you will think of it) is only relative.”",
        "“Sir,” said the lieutenant, “I think it is scarcely worth while to \nembark in such a discussion when we shall all be in Davy Jones’s \nLocker in ten minutes.”",
        "“By parity of reasoning,” returned the Captain gently, “it would \nnever be worth while to begin any inquiry of importance; the odds \nare always overwhelming that we must die before we shall have \nbrought it to an end.  You have not considered, Mr. Spoker, the \nsituation of man,” said the Captain, smiling, and shaking his head.",
        "“I am much more engaged in considering the position of the ship,” \nsaid Mr. Spoker.",
        "“Spoken like a good officer,” replied the Captain, laying his hand \non the lieutenant’s shoulder.",
        "On deck they found the men had broken into the spirit-room, and \nwere fast getting drunk.",
        "“My men,” said the Captain, “there is no sense in this.  The ship \nis going down, you will tell me, in ten minutes: well, and what \nthen?  To the philosophic eye, there is nothing new in our \nposition.  All our lives long, we may have been about to break a \nblood-vessel or to be struck by lightning, not merely in ten \nminutes, but in ten seconds; and that has not prevented us from \neating dinner, no, nor from putting money in the Savings Bank.  I \nassure you, with my hand on my heart, I fail to comprehend your \nattitude.”",
        "The men were already too far gone to pay much heed.",
        "“This is a very painful sight, Mr. Spoker,” said the Captain.",
        "“And yet to the philosophic eye, or whatever it is,” replied the \nfirst lieutenant, “they may be said to have been getting drunk \nsince they came aboard.”",
        "“I do not know if you always follow my thought, Mr. Spoker,” \nreturned the Captain gently.  “But let us proceed.”",
        "In the powder magazine they found an old salt smoking his pipe.",
        "“Good God,” cried the Captain, “what are you about?”",
        "“Well, sir,” said the old salt, apologetically, “they told me as \nshe were going down.”",
        "“And suppose she were?” said the Captain.  “To the philosophic eye, \nthere would be nothing new in our position.  Life, my old shipmate, \nlife, at any moment and in any view, is as dangerous as a sinking \nship; and yet it is man’s handsome fashion to carry umbrellas, to \nwear indiarubber over-shoes, to begin vast works, and to conduct \nhimself in every way as if he might hope to be eternal.  And for my \nown poor part I should despise the man who, even on board a sinking \nship, should omit to take a pill or to wind up his watch.  That, my \nfriend, would not be the human attitude.”",
        "“I beg pardon, sir,” said Mr. Spoker.  “But what is precisely the \ndifference between shaving in a sinking ship and smoking in a \npowder magazine?”",
        "“Or doing anything at all in any conceivable circumstances?” cried \nthe Captain.  “Perfectly conclusive; give me a cigar!”",
        "Two minutes afterwards the ship blew up with a glorious detonation.",
