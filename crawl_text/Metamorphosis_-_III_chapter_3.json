        "No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh,\nso it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury.\nHe had suffered it there for more than a month, and his\ncondition seemed serious enough to remind even his father\nthat Gregor, despite his current sad and revolting form, was\na family member who could not be treated as an enemy.  On\nthe contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any\nrevulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.\nBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his\nmobility – probably permanently.  He had been reduced to the\ncondition of an ancient invalid and it took him long, long\nminutes to crawl across his room – crawling over the ceiling\nwas out of the question – but this deterioration in his\ncondition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door\nto the living room being left open every evening.  He got\ninto the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours\nbefore it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his\nroom where he could not be seen from the living room, he\ncould watch the family in the light of the dinner table and\nlisten to their conversation –  with everyone’s permission,\nin a way, and thus quite differently from before.",
        "They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier\ntimes, of course, the ones that Gregor always thought about\nwith longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed\nin some small hotel room.  All of them were usually very\nquiet nowadays.  Soon after dinner, his father would go to\nsleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each\nother to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp,\nwould sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister,\nwho had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in\nthe evenings so that she might be able to get a better\nposition later on.  Sometimes his father would wake up and\nsay to Gregor’s mother “you’re doing so much sewing again\ntoday!”, as if he did not know that he had been dozing – and\nthen he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister\nwould exchange a tired grin.  With a kind of stubbornness,\nGregor’s father refused to take his uniform off even at\nhome; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor’s\nfather would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if\nalways ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his\nsuperior even here.  The uniform had not been new to start\nwith, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier\ndespite the efforts of Gregor’s mother and sister to look\nafter it.  Gregor would often spend the whole evening\nlooking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold\nbuttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in\nit would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful.",
        "As soon as it struck ten, Gregor’s mother would speak gently\nto his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to\nbed, as he couldn’t sleep properly where he was and he\nreally had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get\nto work.  But since he had been in work he had become more\nobstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the\ntable, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then\nharder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for\nhis bed.  Then, however much mother and sister would\nimportune him with little reproaches and warnings he would\nkeep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with\nhis eyes closed and refusing to get up.  Gregor’s mother\nwould tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear,\nGregor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but\nnothing would have any effect on him.  He would just sink\ndeeper into his chair.  Only when the two women took him\nunder the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them\none after the other and say: “What a life!  This is what\npeace I get in my old age!”  And supported by the two women\nhe would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying\nthe greatest load himself, let the women take him to the\ndoor, send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor’s\nmother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so\nthat they could run after his father and continue being of\nhelp to him.",
        "Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had\ntime to give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely\nnecessary?  The household budget became even smaller; so now\nthe maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwoman\nwith white hair that flapped around her head came every\nmorning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else\nwas looked after by Gregor’s mother on top of the large\namount of sewing work she did.  Gregor even learned,\nlistening to the evening conversation about what price they\nhad hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to\nthe family had been  sold, even though both mother and\nsister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and\ncelebrations.  But the loudest complaint was that although\nthe flat was much too big for their present circumstances,\nthey could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way\nof transferring Gregor to the new address.  He could see\nquite well, though, that there were more reasons than\nconsideration for him that made it difficult for them to\nmove, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any\nsuitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing\nholding the family back from their decision to move was much\nmore to do with their total despair, and the thought that\nthey had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything\nexperienced by anyone else they knew or were related to.",
        "They carried out absolutely everything that the world\nexpects from poor people, Gregor’s father brought bank\nemployees their breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by\nwashing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth\nbehind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they\njust did not have the strength to do any more.  And the\ninjury in Gregor’s back began to hurt as much as when it was\nnew.  After they had come back from taking his father to bed\nGregor’s mother and sister would now leave their work where\nit was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother\nwould point to Gregor’s room and say “Close that door,\nGrete”, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would\nsit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they\nwould simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.",
        "Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.  Sometimes\nhe would think of taking over the family’s affairs, just\nlike before, the next time the door was opened; he had long\nforgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would\nappear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the\napprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from\nother businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial\nhotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again,\na cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been\nserious but too slow, – all of them appeared to him, mixed\ntogether with strangers and others he had forgotten, but\ninstead of helping him and his family they were all of them\ninaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared.",
        "Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his\nfamily, he was filled with simple rage about the lack of\nattention he was shown, and although he could think of\nnothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could\nget into the pantry where he could take all the things he\nwas entitled to, even if he was not hungry.  Gregor’s sister\nno longer thought about how she could please him but would\nhurriedly push some food or other into his room with her\nfoot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at\nmidday, and in the evening she would sweep it away again\nwith the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten\nor – more often than not – had been left totally untouched.\nShe still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she\ncould not have been any quicker about it.  Smears of dirt\nwere left on the walls, here and there were little balls of\ndust and filth.  At first, Gregor went into one of the worst\nof these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to\nher, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his\nsister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as\nwell as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to\nit.",
        "At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite\nnew for her and which everyone in the family understood –\ncleaning up Gregor’s room was for her and her alone.\nGregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and\nneeded to use several bucketfuls of water to do it –\nalthough that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay\nflat on the couch, bitter and immobile.  But his mother was\nto be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly\nhad his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed\nthe change in Gregor’s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back\ninto the living room where, despite her mothers raised and\nimploring hands, she broke into convulsive tears.  Her\nfather, of course, was startled out of his chair and the two\nparents looked on astonished and helpless; then they, too,\nbecame agitated; Gregor’s father, standing to the right of\nhis mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of\nGregor’s room to his sister; from her left, Gregor’s sister\nscreamed at her that she  was never to clean Gregor’s room\nagain; while his mother tried to draw his father, who was\nbeside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister,\nquaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small\nfists; and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even\nthought of closing the door to save him the sight of this\nand all its noise.",
        "Gregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and\nlooking after Gregor as she had done before was even more\nwork for her, but even so his mother ought certainly not to\nhave taken her place.  Gregor, on the other hand, ought not\nto be neglected.  Now, though, the charwoman was here.  This\nelderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her\nable to withstand the hardest of things in her long life,\nwasn’t really repelled by Gregor.  Just by chance one day,\nrather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to\nGregor’s room and found herself face to face with him.  He\nwas taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he\nbegan to rush to and fro while she just stood there in\namazement with her hands crossed in front of her.  From then\non she never failed to open the door slightly every evening\nand morning and look briefly in on him.  At first she would\ncall to him as she did so with words that she probably\nconsidered friendly, such as “come on then, you old dung-\nbeetle!”, or “look at the old dung-beetle there!”  Gregor\nnever responded to being spoken to in that way, but just\nremained where he was without moving as if the door had\nnever even been opened.  If only they had told this\ncharwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting\nher disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it!\nOne day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the\nwindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she\nbegan to speak to him in that way once again.  Gregor was so\nresentful of it that he started to move toward her, he was\nslow and infirm, but it was like a kind of attack.  Instead\nof being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the\nchairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth\nopen, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the\nchair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor’s back.\n“Aren’t you coming any closer, then?”, she asked when Gregor\nturned round again, and she calmly put the chair back in the\ncorner.",
        "Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating.  Only if he\nhappened to find himself next to the food that had been\nprepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to\nplay with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more\noften than not, spit it out again.  At first he thought it\nwas distress at the state of his room that stopped him\neating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there.\nThey had got into the habit of putting things into this room\nthat they had room for anywhere else, and there were now\nmany such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been\nrented out to three gentlemen.  These earnest gentlemen –\nall three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering\nthrough the crack in the door one day – were painfully\ninsistent on things’ being tidy.  This meant not only in\ntheir own room but, since they had taken a room in this\nestablishment, in the entire flat and especially in the\nkitchen.  Unnecessary clutter was something they could not\ntolerate, especially if it was dirty.  They had moreover\nbrought most of their own furnishings and equipment with\nthem.  For this reason, many things had become superfluous\nwhich, although they could not be sold, the family did not\nwish to discard.  All these things found their way into\nGregor’s room.  The dustbins from the kitchen found their\nway in there too.  The charwoman was always in a hurry, and\nanything she couldn’t use for the time being she would just\nchuck in there.  He, fortunately, would usually see no more\nthan the object and the hand that held it.  The woman most\nlikely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had\ntime and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one\ngo, but what actually happened was that they were left where\nthey landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor\nmade his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else.\nAt first he moved it because, with no other room free where\nhe could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came\nto enjoy it although moving about in the way left him sad\nand tired to death and he would remain immobile for hours\nafterwards.",
        "The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their\nevening meal at home in the living room that was used by\neveryone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed\nin the evening.   But Gregor found it easy to give up having\nthe door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use\nof it when it was open and, without the family having\nnoticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner.  One\ntime, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room\nslightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who\nrented the room came in in the evening and the light was put\non.  They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had\ntaken his meals with his father and mother, they unfolded\nthe serviettes and picked up their knives and forks.\nGregor’s mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a\ndish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish\npiled high with potatoes.  The food was steaming, and filled\nthe room with its smell.  The gentlemen bent over the dishes\nset in front of them as if they wanted to test the food\nbefore eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who\nseemed to count as an authority for the other two, did\nindeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its\ndish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was\nsufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the\nkitchen.  It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor’s mother\nand sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to\nbreathe again and smiled.",
        "The family themselves ate in the kitchen.  Nonetheless,\nGregor’s father came into the living room before he went\ninto the kitchen, bowed once with his cap in his hand and\ndid his round of the table.  The gentlemen stood as one, and\nmumbled something into their beards.  Then, once they were\nalone, they ate in near perfect silence.  It seemed\nremarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of\neating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they\nhad wanted to Show Gregor that you need teeth in order to\neat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws\nthat are toothless however nice they might be.  “I’d like to\neat something”, said Gregor anxiously, “but not anything\nlike they’re eating.  They do feed themselves.  And here I\nam, dying!”",
        "Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having\nheard the violin being played, but this evening it began to\nbe heard from the kitchen.  The three gentlemen had already\nfinished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a\nnewspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they\nleant back in their chairs reading them and smoking.  When\nthe violin began playing they became attentive, stood up and\nwent on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they\nstood pressed against each other.  Someone must have heard\nthem in the kitchen, as Gregor’s father called out: “Is the\nplaying perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen?  We can stop\nit straight away.”",
        "“On the contrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady\nnot like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is,\nafter all, much more cosy and comfortable?”  “Oh yes, we’d love to”,\ncalled back Gregor’s father as if he had been the violin player\nhimself.  The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.\nGregor’s father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with\nthe music and his sister with the violin.  She calmly prepared\neverything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never rented\na room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards\nthe three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his\nfather leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between\ntwo buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a\nseat by one of the gentlemen and sat – leaving the chair where the\ngentleman happened to have placed it – out of the way in a corner.",
        "His sister began to play; father and mother paid close\nattention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands.\nDrawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a\nlittle and already had his head in the living room. Before,\nhe had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now\nit hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless\nabout the others.  What’s more, there was now all the  more\nreason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust\nthat lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest\nmovement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food\nabout on his back and sides; he was much too indifferent to\neverything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the\ncarpet like he had used to do several times a day.  And\ndespite this condition, he was not too shy to move forward a\nlittle onto the immaculate floor of the living room.",
        "No-one noticed him, though.  The family was totally\npreoccupied with the violin playing; at first, the three\ngentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up\nfar too close behind the music stand to look at all the\nnotes being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s\nsister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they\nwithdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and\ntalking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the\nwindow while Gregor’s father observed them anxiously.  It\nreally now seemed very obvious that they had expected to\nhear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had\nbeen disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole\nperformance and it was only now out of politeness that they\nallowed their peace to be disturbed.   It was especially\nunnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their\ncigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses.  Yet Gregor’s\nsister was playing so beautifully.  Her face was leant to\none side, following the lines of music with a careful and\nmelancholy expression.  Gregor crawled a little further\nforward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he\ncould meet her eyes if the chance came.  Was he an animal if\nmusic could captivate him so?  It seemed to him that he was\nbeing shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been\nyearning for.  He was determined to make his way forward to\nhis sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come\ninto his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her\nplaying here as much as he would.  He never wanted to let\nher out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his\nshocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him;\nhe wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss\nand spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced\nto stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she\nwould sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to\nhim while he told her how he had always intended to send her\nto the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about\nit last Christmas – had Christmas really come and gone\nalready? – if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and\nrefuse to let anyone dissuade him from it.  On hearing all\nthis, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and\nGregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck,\nwhich, since she had been going out to work, she had kept\nfree without any necklace or collar.",
        "“Mr. Samsa!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’s\nfather, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his\nforefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward.  The violin\nwent silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled\nat his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back\nat Gregor.  His father seemed to think it more important to\ncalm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even\nthough they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor\nwas more entertaining that the violin playing had been.  He\nrushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to\ndrive them back into their room at the same time as trying\nto block their view of Gregor with his body.  Now they did\nbecome a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was\nhis father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning\nrealisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the\nnext room without knowing it.  They asked Gregor’s father\nfor explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged\nexcitedly at heir beards and moved back towards their room\nonly very slowly.  Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had overcome\nthe despair she had fallen into when her playing was\nsuddenly interrupted.  She had let her hands drop and let\nviolin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look\nat the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly\npulled herself together, lay the instrument on her mother’s\nlap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where\nshe was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure\nfrom her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly\nmoving toward.  Under his sister’s experienced hand, the\npillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into\norder and she had already finished making the beds and\nslipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the\nroom.  Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was\ndoing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants.\nHe urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at\nthe door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen\nshouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby\nbrought Gregor’s father to a halt.  “I declare here and\nnow”, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor’s\nmother and sister to gain their attention too, “that with\nregard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat\nand with this family” – here he looked briefly but\ndecisively at the floor – “I give immediate notice on my\nroom.  For the days that I have been living here I will, of\ncourse, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider\nwhether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from\nyou, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the\ngrounds for such an action.”  He was silent and looked\nstraight ahead as if waiting for something.  And indeed, his\ntwo friends joined in with the words: “And we also give\nimmediate notice.”  With that, he took hold of the door\nhandle and slammed the door.",
        "Gregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way\nwith his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was\nstretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from\nthe uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen\nthat he was not sleeping at all.  Throughout all this,\nGregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first\nseen him.  His disappointment at the failure of his plan,\nand perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it\nimpossible for him to move.  He was sure that everyone would\nturn on him any moment, and he waited.  He was not even\nstartled out of this state when the violin on his mother’s\nlap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the\nfloor.",
        "“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with\nher hand as introduction, “we can’t carry on like this.\nMaybe you can’t see it, but I can.  I don’t want to call\nthis monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try\nand get rid of it.  We’ve done all that’s humanly possible\nto look after it and be patient, I don’t think anyone could\naccuse us of doing anything wrong.”  “She’s absolutely\nright”, said Gregor’s father to himself.  His mother, who\nstill had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough\ndully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged\nexpression in her eyes.",
        "Gregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her\nforehead.  Her words seemed to give Gregor’s father some\nmore definite ideas.  He sat upright, played with his\nuniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen\nafter their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as\nhe lay there immobile.",
        "“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Gregor’s sister,\nnow speaking only to her father, as her mother was too\noccupied with coughing to listen, “it’ll be the death of\nboth of you, I can see it coming.  We can’t all work as hard\nas we have to and then come home to be tortured like this,\nwe can’t endure it.  I can’t endure it any more.”  And she\nbroke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face\nof her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand\nmovements.  “My child”, said her father with sympathy and\nobvious understanding, “what are we to do?”  His sister just\nshrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness that\nhad taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainly when\nshe had broken into tears.",
        "“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as\na question; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her\ntears as a sign that of that there was no question.",
        "“If he could just understand us”, repeated Gregor’s father,\nclosing his eyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty\nthat that was quite impossible, “then perhaps we could come\nto some kind of arrangement with him.  But as it is ...”",
        "“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s the only way,\nFather.  You’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’s\nGregor.  We’ve only harmed ourselves by believing it for so\nlong.  How can that be Gregor?  If it were Gregor he would\nhave seen long ago that it’s not possible for human beings\nto live with an animal like that and he would have gone of\nhis own free will.  We wouldn’t have a brother any more,\nthen, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him\nwith respect.  As it is this animal is persecuting us, it’s\ndriven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the\nwhole flat and force us to sleep on the streets.  Father,\nlook, just look”, she suddenly screamed, “he’s starting\nagain!”   In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor’s\ncomprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she\npushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more\nwilling to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near\nGregor.  She rushed over to behind her father, who had\nbecome excited merely because she was and stood up half\nraising his hands in front of Gregor’s sister as if to\nprotect her.",
        "But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least\nof all his sister.  All he had done was begin to turn round\nso that he could go back into his room, although that was in\nitself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant\nthat turning round required a great deal of effort and he\nwas using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising\nit and striking it against the floor.  He stopped and looked\nround.  They seemed to have realised his good intention and\nhad only been alarmed briefly.  Now they all looked at him\nin unhappy silence.  His mother lay in her chair with her\nlegs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes\nnearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his\nfather with her arms around his neck.",
        "“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Gregor and\nwent back to work.  He could not help panting loudly with\nthe effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest.  No-\none was making him rush any more, everything was left up to\nhim.  As soon as he had finally finished turning round he\nbegan to move straight ahead.  He was amazed at the great\ndistance that separated him from his room, and could not\nunderstand how he had covered that distance in his weak\nstate a little while before and almost without noticing it.\nHe concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly\nnoticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his\nfamily to distract him.",
        "He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.\nHe did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck\nbecoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough to see that\nnothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood\nup.  With his last glance he saw that his mother had now\nfallen completely asleep.",
        "He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly\nshut, bolted and locked.  The sudden noise behind Gregor so\nstartled him that his little legs collapsed under him. It\nwas his sister who had been in so much of a rush.  She had\nbeen standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly,\nGregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she turned\nthe key in the lock she said loudly to her parents “At\nlast!”.",
        "“What now, then?”, Gregor asked himself as he looked round\nin the darkness.  He soon made the discovery that he could\nno longer move at all.  This was no surprise to him, it\nseemed rather that being able to actually move around on\nthose spindly little legs until then was unnatural.  He also\nfelt relatively comfortable.  It is true that his entire\nbody was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting\nweaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.\nHe could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back\nor the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered\nin white dust.  He thought back of his family with emotion\nand love.  If it was possible, he felt that he must go away\neven more strongly than his sister.  He remained in this\nstate of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the\nclock tower strike three in the morning.  He watched as it\nslowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too.\nThen, without his willing it, his head sank down completely,\nand his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.",
        "When the cleaner came in early in the morning – they’d often\nasked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her\nstrength and in her hurry she still did, so that everyone in\nthe flat knew when she’d arrived and from then on it was\nimpossible to sleep in peace – she made her usual brief look\nin on Gregor and at first found nothing special.  She\nthought he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the\nmartyr; she attributed all possible understanding to him.\nShe happened to be holding  the long broom in her hand, so\nshe tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway.  When\nshe had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of\nherself and poked at him a little, and only when she found\nshe could shove him across the floor with no resistance at\nall did she start to pay attention.  She soon realised what\nhad really happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to\nherself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom\ndoors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms:\n“Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying there,\nstone dead!”",
        "Mr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed\nand had to make an effort to get over the  shock caused by\nthe cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying.\nBut then, each from his own side, they hurried out of bed.\nMr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa\njust came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went\ninto Gregor’s room.  On the way they opened the door to the\nliving room where Grete had been sleeping since the three\ngentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she  had\nnever been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to\nconfirm this.  “Dead?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the\ncharwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked\nfor herself and could have known it even without checking.\n“That’s what I said”,  replied the cleaner, and to prove it\nshe gave Gregor’s body another shove with the broom, sending\nit sideways across the floor.  Mrs. Samsa made a movement as\nif she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete\nit.  “Now then”, said Mr. Samsa, “let’s give thanks to God\nfor that”.  He crossed himself, and the three women followed\nhis example.",
        "Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said:\n“Just look how thin he was.  He didn’t eat anything for so\nlong.  The food came out again just the same as when it went\nin”.  Gregor’s body was indeed completely dried up and flat,\nthey had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted\nup on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them\nlook away.",
        "“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs.\nSamsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents\ninto the bedroom but not without looking back at the body.\nThe cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide.\nAlthough it was still early in the morning the fresh air had\nsomething of warmth mixed in with it.  It was already the\nend of March, after all.",
        "The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked\nround in amazement for their breakfasts;  they had been\nforgotten about.  “Where is our breakfast?”, the middle\ngentleman asked the cleaner irritably.  She just put her\nfinger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the\nmen that they might like to come into Gregor’s room.  They\ndid so, and stood around Gregor’s corpse with their hands in\nthe pockets of their well-worn coats.  It was now quite\nlight in the room.",
        "Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared\nin his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on\nthe other.  All of them had been crying a little; Grete now\nand then pressed her face against her father’s arm.",
        "“Leave my home.  Now!”, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door\nand without letting the women from him.  “What do you\nmean?”, asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat\ndisconcerted, and he smiled sweetly.  The other two held\ntheir hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them\ntogether in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which\ncould only end in their favour.  “I mean just what I said”,\nanswered Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a\nstraight line towards the man.  At first, he stood there\nstill, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head\nwere rearranging themselves into new positions.  “Alright,\nwe’ll go then”, he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if he\nhad been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted\npermission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision.  Mr. Samsa\nmerely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him\nseveral times.  At that, and without delay, the man actually\ndid take long strides into the front hallway; his two\nfriends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and\nhad been listening to what was being said.  Now they jumped\noff after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that\nMr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and\nbreak the connection with their leader.  Once there, all\nthree took their hats from the stand, took their sticks from\nthe holder, bowed without a word and left the premises.  Mr.\nSamsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing;\nbut they had had no reason to mistrust the men’ intentions\nand as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three\ngentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps.\nAs they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and\nwould reappear a few moments later; the further down they\nwent, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them;\nwhen a butcher’s boy, proud of posture with his tray on his\nhead, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they\nwere, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and\nwent, as if relieved, back into the flat.",
        "They decided the best way to make use of that day was for\nrelaxation and to go for a walk; not only had they earned a\nbreak from work but they were in serious need of it.  So\nthey sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal,\nMr. Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her contractor and\nGrete to her principal.  The cleaner came in while they were\nwriting to tell them she was going, she’d finished her work\nfor that morning.  The three of them at first just nodded\nwithout looking up from what they were writing, and it was\nonly when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave\nthat they looked up in irritation.  “Well?”, asked Mr.\nSamsa.  The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on\nher face as if she had some tremendous good news to report,\nbut would only do it if she was clearly asked to.  The\nalmost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had\nbeen source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the time she had\nbeen working for them, swayed gently in all directions.\n“What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the\ncleaner had the most respect for.  “Yes”, she answered, and\nbroke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak\nstraight away, “well then, that thing in there, you needn’t\nworry about how you’re going to get rid of it.  That’s all\nbeen sorted out.”  Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over their\nletters as if intent on continuing with what they were\nwriting; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start\ndescribing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand,\nhe made it quite clear that she was not to.  So, as she was\nprevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly\nremembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved,\ncalled out “Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round sharply\nand left, slamming the door terribly as she went.",
        "“Tonight she gets sacked”, said Mr. Samsa, but he received\nno reply from either his wife or his daughter as the\ncharwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only\njust gained.  They got up and went over to the window where\nthey remained with their arms around each other.  Mr. Samsa\ntwisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there\nwatching for a while.  Then he called out: “Come here, then.\nLet’s forget about all that old stuff, shall we.  Come and\ngive me a bit of attention”.  The two women immediately did\nas he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and\nhugged him and then they quickly finished their letters.\nAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which\nwas something they had not done for months, and took the\ntram out to the open country outside the town.  They had the\ntram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves.  Leant\nback comfortably on their seats, they discussed their\nprospects and found that on closer examination they were not\nat all bad – until then they had never asked each other\nabout their work but all three had jobs which were very good\nand held particularly good promise for the future.  The\ngreatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be\nachieved quite easily by moving house; what they needed now\nwas a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one\nwhich had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a better\nlocation and, most of all, more practical.  All the time,\nGrete was becoming livelier.  With all the worry they had\nbeen having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while\nthey were talking, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost\nsimultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was\nblossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.  They\nbecame quieter.  Just from each other’s glance and almost\nwithout knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to\nfind a good man for her.  And, as if in confirmation of\ntheir new dreams and good intentions, as soon as they\nreached their destination Grete was the first to get up and\nstretch out her young body.",
