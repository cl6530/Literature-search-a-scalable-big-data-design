        "Leave we now the ardor / wherewith they did prepare,\nAnd tell how Lady Kriemhild / and eke her maidens fair\nFrom land of Nibelungen / did journey to the Rhine.\nNe’er did horses carry / such store of raiment rich and fine.",
        "779",
        "Carrying-chests full many / for the way they made ready.\nThen rode the thane Siegfried / with his friends in company\nAnd eke the queen thither / where joy they looked to find.\nWhere now was high rejoicing / they soon in sorest grief repined.",
        "780",
        "At home behind them left they / Lady Kriemhild’s son\nThat she did bear to Siegfried / –’twas meet that that be done.\nFrom this their festive journey / rose mickle sorrow sore:\nHis father and his mother / their child beheld they never more.",
        "781",
        "Then eke with them thither / Siegmund the king did ride.\nHad he e’er had knowledge / what should there betide\nAnon from that high journey, / such had he never seen:\nNe’er wrought upon dear kindred / might so grievous wrong have been.",
        "782",
        "Messengers sent they forward / that the tidings told should be.\nThen forth did ride to meet them / with gladsome company\nUte’s friends full many / and many a Gunther’s man.\nWith zeal to make him ready / unto his guests the king began.",
        "783",
        "Where he found Brunhild sitting, / thither straight went he.\n“How received thee my sister, / as thou cam’st to this country?\nLike preparations shalt thou / for Siegfried’s wife now make.\"\n“Fain do I that; good reason / have I to love her well,” she spake.",
        "784",
        "Then quoth the mighty monarch: / “The morn shall see them here.\nWilt thou go forth to meet them, / apace do thou prepare,\nThat not within the castle / their coming we await.\nGuests more welcome never / greeted I of high estate.”",
        "785",
        "Her maidens and her ladies / straight did she command\nTo choose them rich apparel, / the best within the land,\nIn which the stately company / before the guests should go.\nThe same they did right gladly, / that may ye full surely know.",
        "786",
        "Then eke to offer service / the men of Gunther hied,\nAnd all his doughty warriors / saw ye by the monarch’s side.\nThen rode the queen full stately / the strangers forth to meet,\nAnd hearty was the welcome / as she her loving guests did greet.",
        "787",
        "With what glad rejoicings / the guests they did receive!\nThey deemed that Lady Kriemhild / did unto Brunhild give\nNe’er so warm a welcome / to the land of Burgundy.\nBold knights that yet were strangers / rejoiced each other there to see.",
        "788",
        "Now come was also Siegfried / with his valiant men.\nThe warriors saw ye riding / thither and back again,\nWhere’er the plain extended, / with huge company.\nFrom the dust and crowding / could none in all the rout be free.",
        "789",
        "When the monarch of the country / Siegfried did see\nAnd with him also Siegmund, / spake he full lovingly:\n“Be ye to me full welcome / and to all these friends of mine.\nOur hearts right glad they shall be / o’er this your journey to the\n      Rhine.”",
        "790",
        "“God give thee meed,” spake Siegmund, / a knight in honor grown.\n“Since that my son Siegfried / thee for a friend hath known,\nMy heart hath e’er advised me / that thee I soon should see.\"\nThereto spake royal Gunther: / “Joy hast thou brought full great to me.”",
        "791",
        "Siegfried was there received, / as fitted his high state,\nWith full lofty honors, / nor one did bear him hate.\nThere joined in way right courteous / Gernot and Giselher:\nI ween so warm a welcome / did they make for strangers ne’er.",
        "792",
        "The spouse of each high monarch / greeted the other there.\nEmptied was many a saddle, / and many a lady fair\nBy hero’s hand was lifted / adown upon the sward.\nBy waiting on fair lady / how many a knight sought high reward!",
        "793",
        "So went unto each other / the ladies richly dight;\nThereat in high rejoicing / was seen full many a knight,\nThat by both the greeting / in such fair way was done.\nBy fair maidens standing / saw ye warriors many a one.",
        "794",
        "Each took the hand of other / in all their company;\nIn courteous manner bending / full many might ye see\nAnd loving kisses given / by ladies debonair.\nRejoiced the men of Gunther / and Siegfried to behold them there.",
        "795",
        "They bided there no longer / but rode into the town.\nThe host bade to the strangers / in fitting way be shown,\nThat they were seen full gladly / in the land of Burgundy.\nHigh knights full many tilting / before fair ladies might ye see.",
        "796",
        "Then did of Tronje Hagen / and eke Ortwein\nIn high feats of valor / all other knights outshine.\nWhate’er the twain commanded / dared none to leave undone;\nBy them was many a service / to their high guests in honor shown.",
        "797",
        "Shields heard ye many clashing / before the castle gate\nWith din of lances breaking. / Long in saddle sate\nThe host and guests there with him, / ere that within they went.\nWith full merry pastime / joyfully the hours they spent.",
        "798",
        "Unto the Hall so spacious / rode the merry company.\nMany a silken cover / wrought full cunningly\nSaw ye beyond the saddles / of the ladies debonair\nOn all sides down hanging. / King Gunther’s men did meet them there.",
        "799",
        "Led by the same the strangers / to their apartments passed.\nMeanwhile oft her glances / Brunhild was seen to cast\nUpon the Lady Kriemhild, / for she was passing fair.\nIn lustre vied her color / with the gold that she did wear.",
        "800",
        "Within the town a clamor / at Worms on every hand\nArose amid their followers. / King Gunther gave command\nTo Dankwart his Marshal / to tend them all with care.\nThen bade he fitting quarters / for the retinue prepare.",
        "801",
        "Without and in the castle / the board for all was set:\nIn sooth were never strangers / better tended yet.\nWhatever any wished for / did they straightway provide:\nSo mighty was the monarch / that naught to any was denied.",
        "802",
        "To them was kind attention / and all good friendship shown.\nThe host then at the table / with his guests sat him down.\nSiegfried they bade be seated / where he did sit before.\nThen went with him to table / full many a stately warrior more.",
        "803",
        "Gallant knights twelve hundred / in the circle there, I ween,\nWith him sat at table. / Brunhild the lofty queen\nDid deem that never vassal / could more mighty be.\nSo well she yet was minded, / she saw it not unwillingly.",
        "804",
        "There upon an evening, / as the king with guests did dine,\nFull many a rich attire / was wet with ruddy wine,\nAs passed among the tables / the butlers to and fro.\nAnd great was their endeavor / full honor to the guests to show.",
        "805",
        "As long hath been the custom / at high festivity\nFit lodging there was given / to maid and high lady.\nFrom whence soe’er they came there / they had the host’s good care;\nUnto each guest was meted / of fitting honors fullest share.",
        "806",
        "When now the night was ended / and came forth the dawn,\nFrom chests they carried with them, / full many a precious stone\nSparkled on costly raiment / by hand of lady sought.\nStately robes full many / forth to deck them then they brought.",
        "807",
        "Ere dawn was full appeared, / before the Hall again\nCame knights and squires many, / whereat arose the din\nE’en before the matins / that for the king were sung.\nWell pleased was the monarch / at joust to see the warriors young.",
        "808",
        "Full lustily and loudly / many a horn did blare,\nOf flutes and eke of trumpets / such din did rend the air\nThat loud came back the echo / from Worms the city wide.\nThe warriors high-hearted / to saddle sprung on every side.",
        "809",
        "Arose there in that country / high a jousting keen\nOf many a doughty warrior / whereof were many seen,\nWhom there their hearts more youthful / did make of merry mood;\nOf these ’neath shield there saw ye / many a stately knight and good.",
        "810",
        "There sat within the casements / many a high lady\nAnd maidens many with them, / the which were fair to see.\nDown looked they where did tourney / many a valiant man.\nThe host with his good kinsmen / himself a-riding soon began.",
        "811",
        "Thus they found them pastime, / and fled the time full well;\nThen heard they from the minster / the sound of many a bell.\nForth upon their horses / the ladies thence did ride;\nMany a knight full valiant / the lofty queens accompanied.",
        "812",
        "They then before the minster / alighted on the grass.\nUnto her guests Queen Brunhild / yet well-minded was.\nInto the spacious minster / they passed, and each wore crown.\nTheir friendship yet was broken / by direst jealousy anon.",
        "813",
        "When the mass was ended / went they thence again\nIn full stately manner. / Thereafter were they seen\nJoyous at board together. / The pleasure full did last,\nUntil days eleven / amid the merry-making passed.",
