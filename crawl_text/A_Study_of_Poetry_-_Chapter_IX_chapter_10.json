        "RACE, EPOCH AND INDIVIDUAL",
        "  “Unless there is a concurrence between the contemporary idioms and\n  rhythms of a period, with the individual idiom of the lyrist, half\n  the expressional force of his ideas will be lost.\"\n    ERNEST RHYS, Foreword to Lyric Poetry",
        "We have been considering the typical qualities and forms of lyric poetry.\nLet us now attempt a rapid survey of some of the conditions which have\ngiven the lyric, in certain races and periods and in the hands of certain\nindividuals, its peculiar power.",
        "1. Questions that are involved\nA whole generation of so-called “scientific” criticism has come and gone\nsince Taine’s brilliant experiments with his formula of “race, period and\nenvironment” as applied to literature. Taine’s English Literatureremains a monument to the suggestiveness and to the dangers of his method.\nSome of his countrymen, notably Brunetière in the Evolution de la Poésie\nLyrique en France au XIX Siècle, and Legouis in the Défense de la Poésie\nFrançaise, have discussed more cautiously and delicately than Taine\nhimself the racial and historic conditions affecting lyric poetry in\nvarious periods.",
        "The tendency at present, among critics of poetry, is to distrust formulas\nand to keep closely to ascertainable facts, and this tendency is surely\nmore scientific than the most captivating theorizing. For one thing, while\nrecognizing, as the World War has freshly compelled us to recognize, the\nactuality of racial differences, we have grown sceptical of the old\nendeavors to classify races in simple terms, as Madame de Staël attempted\nto do, for instance, in her famous book on Germany. We endeavor to\ndistinguish, more accurately than of old, between ethnic, linguistic and\npolitical divisions of men. We try to look behind the name at the thing\nitself: we remember that “Spanish” architecture is Arabian, and a good\ndeal of “Gothic” is Northern French. We confess that we are only at the\nbeginning of a true science of ethnology. “It is only in their degree of\nphysical and mental evolution that the races of men are different,\"\nsays Professor W. Z. Ripley, author of Races in Europe. The late\nProfessor Josiah Royce admitted: “I am baffled to discover just what the\nresults of science are regarding the true psychological and moral meaning\nof race differences.... All men in prehistoric times are surprisingly\nalike in their minds, their morals and their arts....  We do not\nscientifically know what the true racial varieties of mental type really\nare.\"\n[Footnote: See Royce’s Race-Questions. New York, 1908.]",
        "I have often thought of these utterances of my colleagues, as I have\nattempted to teach something about lyric poetry in Harvard classrooms\nwhere Chinese, Japanese, Jewish, Irish, French, German, Negro, Russian,\nItalian and Armenian students appear in bewildering and stimulating\nconfusion. Precisely what is their racial reaction to a lyric of Sappho?\nTo an Anglo-Saxon war-song of the tenth century? To a Scotch ballad? To\none of Shakspere’s songs? Some specific racial reaction there must be,\none imagines, but such capacity for self-expression as the student\ncommands is rarely capable of giving more than a hint of it.",
        "And what real response is there, among the majority of contemporary\nlovers of poetry, to the delicate shades of feeling which color the\nverse of specific periods in the various national literatures? We all use\ncatch-words, and I shall use them myself later in this chapter, in the\nattempt to indicate the changes in lyric atmosphere as we pass, for\ninstance, from the Elizabethan to the Jacobean age, or from the “Augustan\"\nto the Romantic epoch in English literature. Is this sensitiveness to the\ntemper of various historic periods merely the possession of a few hundred\nprofessional scholars, who have trained themselves, like Walter Pater, to\nlive in some well-chosen moment of the past and to find in their\nhyper-sensitized responsiveness to its voices a sort of consolation prize\nfor their isolation from the present? Race-mindedness is common, no doubt,\nbut difficult to express in words: historic-mindedness, though more\ncapable of expression, is necessarily confined to a few. Is the response\nto the poetry of past epochs, then, chiefly a response of the individual\nreader to an individual poet, and do we cross the frontiers of race and\nlanguage and historic periods with the main purpose of finding a man after\nour own heart? Or is the secret of our pleasure in the poetry of alien\nraces and far-off times simply this: that nothing human is really alien,\nand that poetry through its generalizing, universalizing power, reveals to\nus the essential oneness of mankind?",
        "2. Graphic Arts and the Lyric\nA specific illustration may suggest an answer. An American collector of\nJapanese prints recognizes in these specimens of Oriental craftsmanship\nthat mastery of line and composition which are a part of the universal\nlanguage of the graphic arts. Any human being, in fact, who has developed\na sensitiveness to artistic beauty will receive a measure of delight from\nthe work of Japanese masters. A few strokes of the brush upon silk, a bit\nof lacquer work, the decoration of a sword-hilt, are enough to set his eye\ndancing. But the expert collector soon passes beyond this general\nenthusiasm into a quite particular interest in the handicraft of special\nartists,–a Motonobu, let us say, or a Sesshiu. The collector finds his\npleasure in their individual handling of artistic problems, their unique\nfaculties of eye and hand. He responds, in a word, both to the\ncosmopolitan language employed by every practitioner of the fine arts, and\nto the local idiom, the personal accent, of, let us say, a certain\nJapanese draughtsman of the eighteenth century.",
        "And now take, by way of confirmation and also of contrast, the attitude of\nan American lover of poetry toward those specimens of Japanese and Chinese\nlyrics which have recently been presented to us in English translations.\nThe American’s ignorance of the riental languages cuts him off from any\nappreciation of the individual handling of diction and metre. A Lafcadio\nHearn may write delightfully about that special seventeen syllable form of\nJapanese verse known as the hokku. Here is a hokku by Basho, one of\nthe most skilled composers in that form. Hearn prints it with the\ntranslation,\n[Footnote: Kwaidan, p. 188. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1904.]\nand explains that the verses are intended to suggest the joyous feeling of\nspring-time:",
        "    “Oki, oki yo!\n  Waga tomo ni sen\n    Néru–kocho!”",
        "(Wake up! Wake up!–I will make thee my comrade, thou sleeping butterfly.)\nAn Occidental reader may recognize, through the translation, the charm of\nthe poetic image, and he may be interested in a technical lyric form\nhitherto new to him, but beyond this, in his ignorance of Japanese, he\ncannot go. Here is a lyric by Wang Ch’ang-Ling, a Chinese poet of the\neighth century:",
        " Tears in the Spring[Footnote: These Chinese lyrics are quoted from The Lute of Jade,\nLondon, 1909. The translations are by L. Cranmer-Byng.]",
        "  “Clad in blue silk and bright embroidery\n  At the first call of Spring the fair young bride,\n  On whom as yet Sorrow has laid no scar,\n  Climbs the Kingfisher’s Tower. Suddenly\n  She sees the bloom of willows far and wide,\n  And grieves for him she lent to fame and war.”",
        "And here is another spring lyric by Po Chü-I (A.D. 772-846), as clear and\nsimple as anything in the Greek Anthology:",
        " The Grass[Footnote: These Chinese lyrics are quoted from The Lute of Jade,\nLondon, 1909. The translations are by L. Cranmer-Byng.]",
        "  “How beautiful and fresh the grass returns!\n  When golden days decline, the meadow burns;\n  Yet autumn suns no hidden root have slain,\n  The spring winds blow, and there is grass again.",
        "  “Green rioting on olden ways it falls:\n  The blue sky storms the ruined city walls;\n  Yet since Wang Sun departed long ago,\n  When the grass blooms both joy and fear I know.”",
        "The Western reader, although wholly at the mercy of the translator,\nrecognizes the pathos and beauty of the scene and thought expressed by the\nChinese poet. But all that is specifically Chinese in lyric form is lost\nto him.",
        "I have purposely chosen these Oriental types of lyric because they\nrepresent so clearly the difference between the universal language of the\ngraphic arts and the more specialized language of poetry. The latter is\nstill able to convey, even through translation, a suggestion of the\nemotions common to all men; and this is true of the verse which lies\nwholly outside the line of that Hebrew-Greek-Roman tradition which has\naffected so profoundly the development of modern European literature. Yet\nto express ’ce que tout le monde pense“–which was Boileau’s version of\nHorace’s ’propria communia dicere“–is only part of the function of\nlyric poetry. To give the body of the time the form and pressure of\nindividual feeling, of individual artistic mastery of the language of\none’s race and epoch;–this, no less than the other, is the task and the\nopportunity of the lyric poet.",
        "3. Decay and Survival\nTo appreciate the triumph of whatever lyrics have survived, even when\nsheltered by the protection of common racial or cultural traditions, one\nmust remember that the overwhelming majority of lyrics, like the majority\nof artistic products of all ages and races and stages of civilization, are\nirretrievably lost. Weak-winged is song! A book like Gummere’s Beginnings\nof Poetry, glancing as it does at the origins of so many national\nliteratures and at the rudimentary poetic efforts of various races that\nhave never emerged from barbarism, gives one a poignant sense of the\nprodigality of the song-impulse compared with the slenderness of the\nactual survivals. Autumn leaves are not more fugitive. Even when preserved\nby sacred ritual, like the Vedas and the Hebrew Psalter, what we possess\nis only an infinitesimal fraction of what has perished. The Sibyl tears\nleaf after leaf from her precious volume and scatters them to the winds.\nHow many glorious Hebrew war-songs of the type presented in the “Song of\nDeborah” were chanted only to be forgotten! We have but a handful of the\nlyrics of Sappho and of the odes of Pindar, while the fragments of lyric\nverse gathered up in the Greek Anthology tantalize us with their\nreminder of what has been lost beyond recall.",
        "Yet if we keep to the line of Hebrew-Greek-Roman tradition, we are equally\nimpressed with the enduring influence of the few lyrics that have\nsurvived. The Hebrew lyric, in its diction, its rhythmical patterns, and\nabove all in its flaming intensity of spirit, bears the marks of racial\npurity, of mental vigor and moral elevation. It became something even more\nsignificant, however, than the spiritual expression of a chosen race. The\nEast met the West when these ancient songs of the Hebrew Psalter were\nadopted and sung by the Christian Church. They were translated, in the\nfourth century, into the Latin of the Vulgate. Many an Anglo-Saxon gleeman\nknew that Latin version. It moulded century after century the liturgy of\nthe European world. It influenced Tyndale’s English version of the Psalms,\nand this has in turn affected the whole vocabulary and style of the modern\nEnglish lyric. There is scarcely a page of the Oxford Book of English\nVerse which does not betray in word or phrase the influence of the\nHebrew Psalter.",
        "Or take that other marvelous example of the expression of emotion in terms\nof bodily sensation, the lyric of the Greeks. Its clarity and unity, its\ndislike of vagueness and excess, its finely artistic restraint, are\ncharacteristic of the race. The simpler Greek lyrical measures were taken\nover by Catullus, Horace and Ovid, and though there were subtle qualities\nof the Greek models which escaped the Roman imitators, the Greco-Roman or\n“classic” restraint of over-turbulent emotions became a European heritage.\nIt is doubtless true, as Dr. Henry Osborn Taylor has pointed out,\n[Footnote: See his Classical Heritage of the Middle Ages, chap. 9, and\nparticularly the passage quoted in the “Notes and Illustrations” to chap.\nv of this volume.]\nthat the Greek and Roman classical metres became in time inadequate to\nexpress the new Christian spirit “which knew neither clarity nor measure.\"\n“The antique sense of form and proportion, the antique observance of the\nmean and avoidance of extravagance and excess, the antique dislike for the\nunlimited or the monstrous, the antique feeling for literary unity, and\nabstention from irrelevancy, the frank love for all that is beautiful or\ncharming, for the beauty of the body and for everything connected with the\njoy of mortal life, the antique reticence as to hopes or fears of what was\nbeyond the grave,–these qualities cease in medieval Latin poetry.”",
        "4. Lyrics of Western Europe\nThe racial characteristics of the peoples of Western Europe began to show\nthemselves even in their Latin poetry, but it is naturally in the rise of\nthe vernacular literatures, during the Middle Ages, that we trace the\nsigns of thnic differentiation. Teuton and Frank and Norseman, Spaniard or\nItalian, betray their blood as soon as they begin to sing in their own\ntongue. The scanty remains of Anglo-Saxon lyrical verse are colored with\nthe love of battle and of the sea, with the desolateness of lonely wolds,\nwith the passion of loyalty to a leader. Read “Deor’s Lament,” “Widsith,\"\n“The Wanderer,” “The Sea-farer,” or the battle-songs of Brunanburh and\nMaldon in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.\n[Footnote: See Cook and Tinker, Select Translations from Old English\nPoetry (Boston, 1902), and Pancoast and Spaeth, Early English Poems(New York, 1911).]\nThe last strophe of “Deor’s Lament,” our oldest English lyric, ends with\nthe line:",
        " “Thaes ofereode, thisses swa maeg” “That he surmounted, so this may I!”\nThe wandering Ulysses says something like this, it is true, in a line of\nthe Odyssey, but to feel its English racial quality one has only to read\nafter it Masefield’s “To-morrow”:",
        "  “Oh yesterday our little troop was ridden through and through,\n  Our swaying, tattered pennons fled, a broken beaten few,\n  And all a summer afternoon they hunted us and slew;\n                   But to-morrow,\n  By the living God, we ’II try the game again!”",
        "When Taillefer, knight and minstrel, rode in front of the Norman line at\nthe battle of Hastings, “singing of Charlemagne and of Roland and of\nOliver and the vassals who fell at Roncevaux,” he typified the coming\ntriumphs of French song in England.\n[Footnote: See E. B. Reed, English Lyrical Poetry, chap. 2. 1912.]\nFrench lyrical fashions would have won their way, no doubt, had there been\nno battle of Hastings. The banners of William the Conqueror had been\nblessed by Rome. They represented Europe, and the inevitable flooding of\nthe island outpost of “Germania” by the tide of European civilization.\nChanson and carole, dance-songs, troubadour lyrics, the ballade,\nrondel and Noël, amorous songs of French courtiers, pious hymns of\nFrench monks, began to sing themselves in England. The new grace and\ndelicacy is upon every page of Chaucer. What was first Provençal and then\nFrench, became English when Chaucer touched it. From the shadow and\ngrimness and elegiac pathos of Old English poetry we come suddenly into\nthe light and color and gayety of Southern France.\n[Footnote: See the passage from Legouis quoted in the “Notes and\nIllustrations” for this chapter.]\nIn place of Caedmon’s terrible picture of Hell–\"ever fire or frost\"–or\nDunbar’s “Lament for the Makers” (Oxford, No. 21) with its refrain:",
        "  ’Timor Mortis conturbat me,“",
        "or the haunting burden of the “Lyke-Wake Dirge” (Oxford, No. 381),",
        "  “This ae nighte, this ae nighte,\n    –Every nighte and alle,\n  Fire and sleet and candle-lighte,\n    And Christe receive thy saule,”",
        "we now find English poets echoing Aucassin and Nicolette:",
        "  “In Paradise what have I to win? Therein I seek not to enter, but only\n  to have Nicolette, my sweet lady that I love so well. For into Paradise\n  go none but such folk as I shall tell thee now: Thither go these same\n  old priests, and halt old men and maimed, who all day and night cower\n  continually before the altars and in the crypts; and such folk as wear\n  old amices and old clouted frocks, and naked folk and shoeless, and\n  covered with sores, perishing of hunger and thirst and of cold, and of\n  little ease. These be they that go into Paradise; with them I have\n  naught to make. But into Hell would I fain go; for into Hell fare the\n  goodly clerks, and goodly knights that fall in tourneys and great wars,\n  and stout men at arms, and all men noble. With these would I liefly go.\n  And thither pass the sweet ladies and courteous that have two lovers or\n  three, and their lords also thereto. Thither goes the gold and the\n  silver, the cloth of vair and cloth of gris, and harpers and makers, and\n  the prince of this world. With these I would gladly go, let me but have\n  with me Nicolette, my sweetest lady.”",
        "5. The Elizabethan Lyric\nThe European influence came afresh to England, as we have seen, with those\n“courtly makers” who travelled into France and Italy and brought back the\nnew-found treasures of the Renaissance. Greece and Rome renewed, as they\nare forever from time to time renewing, their hold upon the imagination\nand the art of English verse. Sometimes this influence of the classics has\nworked toward contraction, restraint, acceptance of human limitations and\nof the “rules” of art. But in Elizabethan poetry the classical influence\nwas on the side of expansion. In that release of vital energy which\ncharacterized the English Renaissance, the rediscovery of Greece and Rome\nand the artistic contacts with France and Italy heightened the confidence\nof Englishmen, revealed the continuity of history and gave new faith in\nhuman nature. It spelled, for the moment at least, liberty rather than\nauthority. It stimulated intellectual curiosity and enthusiasm. Literary\ncriticism awoke to life in the trenchant discussions of the art of poetry\nby Gascoigne and Sidney, by Puttenham, Campion and Daniel. The very titles\nof the collections of lyrics which followed the famous Tottel’s\nMiscellany of 1557 flash with the spirit of the epoch: A Paradise of\nDainty Devices, A Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant Inventions, A Handfull\nof Pleasant Delights, The Phoenix Nest, England’s Helicon, Davison’s\nPoetical Rhapsody.\nBullen, Schelling, Rhys, Braithwaite, and other modern collectors of the\nElizabethan lyric have ravaged these volumes and many more, and have shown\nhow the imported Italian pastoral tallied with the English idyllic mood,\nhow the study of prosody yielded rich and various stanzaic effects, how\nthe diffusion of the passion for song through all classes of the community\ngave a marvelous singing quality to otherwise thin and mere “dildido\"\nlines. Mr. Arnold Dolmetsch and his friends have revived the music of the\nElizabethan song-books, and John Erskine and other scholars have\ninvestigated the relation of the song-books–especially the songs composed\nby musicians such as Byrd, Dowland and Campion–to the form and quality of\nthe surviving lyric verse. But one does not need a knowledge of the\nElizabethan lute and viol, and of the precise difference between a\n“madrigal” and a “catch” or “air” in order to perceive the tunefulness\nof a typical Elizabethan song:",
        " “I care not for these ladies,\n  That must be woode and praide:\n  Give me kind Amarillis,\n  The wanton countrey maide.\n  Nature art disdaineth,\n  Here beautie is her owne.\n    Her when we court and kisse,\n    She cries, Forsooth, let go:\n    But when we come where comfort is,\n    She never will say No.”",
        "It is not that the spirit of Elizabethan lyric verse is always care-free,\neven when written by prodigals such as Peele and Greene and Marlowe. Its\nchildlike grasping after sensuous pleasure is often shadowed by the sword,\nand by quick-coming thoughts of the brevity of mortal things. Yet it is\nalways spontaneous, swift, alive. Its individual voices caught the tempo\nand cadence of the race and epoch, so that men as unlike personally as\nSpenser, Marlowe and Donne are each truly “Elizabethan.” Spenser’s\n“vine-like” luxuriance, Marlowe’s soaring energy, Donne’s grave realistic\nsubtleties, illustrate indeed that note of individualism which is never\nlacking in the great poetic periods. This individualism betrays itself in\nalmost every song of Shakspere’s plays. For here is English race, surely,\nand the very echo and temper of the Renaissance, but with it all there is\nthe indescribable, inimitable timbre of one man’s singing voice.",
        "6. The Reaction\nIf we turn, however, from the lyrics of Shakspere to those of Ben Jonson\nand of the “sons of Ben” who sang in the reigns of James I and Charles I,\nwe become increasingly conscious of a change in atmosphere. The moment of\nexpansion has passed. The “first fine careless rapture” is over. Classical\n“authority” resumes its silent, steady pressure. Scholars like to remember\nthat the opening lines of Ben Jonson’s “Drink to me only with thine eyes\"\nare a transcript from the Greek. In his “Ode to Himself upon the Censure\nof his New Inn” in 1620 Jonson, like Landor long afterward, takes\nscornful refuge from the present in turning back to Greece and Rome:",
        "  “Leave things so prostitute,\n     And take the Alcaic lute;\n   Or thine own Horace, or Anacreon’s lyre;\n     Warm thee by Pindar’s fire.”",
        "The reaction in lyric form showed itself in the decay of sonnet, pastoral\nand madrigal, in the neglect of blank verse, in the development of the\ncouplet. Milton, in such matters as these, was a solitary survival of the\nElizabethans. Metrical experimentation almost ceased, except in the hands\nof ingenious recluses like George Herbert. The popular metre of the\nCaroline poets was the rhymed eight and six syllable quatrain:",
        "  “Yet this inconstancy is such\n     As thou too shalt adore;\n   I could not love thee, Dear, so much\n     Loved I not Honour more.”",
        "The mystics like Crashaw, Vaughan and Traherne wished and secured a wider\nmetrical liberty, and it is, in truth, these complicated patterns of the\ndevotional lyric of the seventeenth century that are of greatest interest\nto the poets of our own day. But contemporary taste, throughout the\ngreater portion of that swiftly changing epoch, preferred verse that\nshowed a conservative balance in thought and feeling, in diction and\nversification. Waller, with his courtier-like instinct for what was\nacceptable, took the middle of the road, letting Cowley and Quarles\nexperiment as fantastically as they pleased. Andrew Marvell, too, a\nPuritan writing in the Restoration epoch, composed as “smoothly\"\nas Waller. Herrick, likewise, though fond of minor metrical experiments,\ncelebrated his quiet garden pleasures and his dalliance with amorous\nfancies in verse of the true Horatian type. “Intensive rather than\nexpansive, fanciful rather than imaginative, and increasingly restrictive\nin its range and appeal”: that is Professor Schelling’s expert summary of\nthe poetic tendencies of the age.",
        "And then the lyric impulse died away in England. Dryden could be\nmagnificently sonorous in declamation and satire, but he lacked the\nsinging voice. Pope likewise, though he “lisped in numbers,” could never,\nfor all of his cleverness, learn to sing. The age of the Augustans, in the\nfirst quarter of the eighteenth century, was an age of prose, of reason,\nof good sense, of “correctness.” The decasyllabic couplet, so resonant in\nDryden, so admirably turned and polished by Pope, was its favorite\nmeasure. The poets played safe. They took no chances with “enthusiasm,\"\neither in mood or metrical device. What could be said within the\nrestraining limits of the couplet they said with admirable point, vigor\nand grace. But it was speech, not song.",
        "7. The Romantic Lyric\nThe revolt came towards the middle of the century, first in the lyrics of\nCollins, then in Gray. The lark began to soar and sing once more in\nEnglish skies. New windows were opened in the House of Life. Men looked\nout again with curiosity, wonder and a sense of strangeness in the\npresence of beauty. They saw Nature with new eyes; found a new richness in\nthe Past, a new picturesque and savor in the life of other races,\nparticularly in the wild Northern and Celtic strains of blood. Life grew\nagain something mysterious, not to be comprehended by the “good sense” of\nthe Augustans, or expressible in the terms of the rhymed couplet. Instead\nof the normal, poets sought the exceptional, then the strange, the\nfar-away in time or place, or else the familiar set in some unusual\nfantastic light. The mood of poetry changed from tranquil sentiment to\nexcited sentiment or “sensibility,” and then to sheer passion. The forms\nof poetry shifted from the conventional to the revival of old measures\nlike blank verse and the Spenserian stanza, then to the invention of new\nand freer forms, growing ever more lyrical. Poetic diction rebelled\nagainst the Augustan conventions, the stereotyped epithets, the frigid\npersonifications. It abandoned the abstract and general for the specific\nand the picturesque. It turned to the language of real life, and then,\ndissatisfied, to the heightened language of passion. If one reads Cowper,\nBlake, Burns and Wordsworth, to say nothing of poets like Byron and\nShelley who wrote in the full Romantic tide of feeling, one finds that\nthis poetry has discovered new themes. It portrays the child, the peasant,\nthe villager, the outcast, the slave, the solitary person, even the idiot\nand the lunatic. There is a new human feeling for the individual, and for\nthe endless, the poignant variety of “states of soul.” Browning, by and\nby, is to declare that “states of soul” are the only things worth a poet’s\nattention.",
        "Now this new individuality of themes, of language, of moods, assisted in\nthe free expression of lyricism, the release of the song-impulse of the\n“single, separate person.” The Romantic movement was revelatory, in a\ndouble sense. “Creation widened in man’s view\"; and there was equally a\nrevelation of individual poetic energy which gave the Romantic lyric an\nextraordinary variety and beauty of form. There was an exaggerated\nindividualism, no doubt, which marked the weak side of the whole movement:\na deliberate extravagance, a cultivated egoism. Vagueness has its\nlegitimate poetic charm, but in England no less than in Germany or France\nlyric vagueness often became incoherence. Symbolism degenerated into\nmeaninglessness. But the fantastic and grotesque side of Romantic\nindividualism should not blind us to the central fact that a rich\npersonality may appear in a queer garb. Victor Hugo, like his young\nfriends of the 1830’s, loved to make the gray-coated citizens of Paris\nstare at his scarlet, but the personality which could create such lyric\nmarvels as the Odes et Ballades may be forgiven for its eccentricities.\nWilliam Blake was eccentric to the verge of insanity, yet he opened, like\nWhitman and Poe, new doors of ivory into the wonder-world.",
        "Yet a lyrist like Keats, it must be remembered, betrayed his personality\nnot so much through any external peculiarity of the Romantic temperament\nas through the actual texture of his word and phrase and rhythm. Examine\nhis brush-work microscopically, as experts in Italian painting examine the\nbrushstrokes and pigments of some picture attributed to this or that\nmaster: you will see that Keats, like all the supreme masters of poetic\ndiction, enciphered his lyric message in a language peculiarly his own. It\nis for us to decipher it as we may. He used, of course, particularly in\nhis earlier work, some of the stock-epithets, the stock poetic\n“properties” of the Romantic school, just as the young Tennyson, in his\nvolume of 1827, played with the “owl” and the “midnight” and the “solitary\nmere,” stock properties of eighteenth-century romance. Yet Tennyson, like\nKeats, and for that matter like Shakspere, passed through this imitative\nphase into an artistic maturity where without violence or extravagance or\neccentricity he compelled words to do his bidding. Each word bears the\nfinger-print of a personality.",
        "Now it is precisely this revelation of personality which gave zest,\nthroughout the Romantic period, to the curiosity about the poetry of alien\nraces. It will be remembered that Romanticism followed immediately upon a\nperiod of cosmopolitanism, and that it preceded that era of intense\nnationalism which came after the Napoleonic wars. Even in that\nintellectual “United States of Europe,” about 1750–when nationalistic\ndifferences were minimized, “enlightenment” was supreme and “propria\ncommunia dicere” was the literary motto–there was nevertheless a rapidly\ngrowing curiosity about races and literatures outside the charmed circle\nof Western Europe. It was the era of the Oriental tale, of Northern\nmythology. Then the poets of England, France and Germany began their\nfruitful interchange of inspiration. Walter Scott turned poet when he\ntranslated Burger’s “Lenore.” Goethe read Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus.\nWordsworth and Coleridge visited Germany not in search of general\neighteenth-century “enlightenment,” but rather in quest of some peculiar\nrevelation of truth and beauty. In the full tide of Romanticism,\nProtestant Germany sought inspiration in Italy and Spain, as Catholic\nFrance sought it in Germany and England. A new sense of race-values\nwas evident in poetry. It may be seen in Southey, Moore, and Byron, in\nHugo’s Les Orientales and in Leconte de Lisle’s Poèmes Barbares.\nModern music has shown the same tendency: Strauss of Vienna writes waltzes\nin Arab rhythms, Grieg composes a Scotch symphony, Dvorák writes an\nAmerican national anthem utilizing negro melodies. As communication\nbetween races has grown easier, and the interest in race-characteristics\nmore intense, it would be strange indeed if lovers of lyric poetry did not\nrange far afield in their search for new complexities of lyric feeling.",
        "8. The Explorer’s Pleasure\nThis explorer’s pleasure in discovering the lyrics of other races was\nnever more keen than it is to-day. Every additional language that one\nlearns, every new sojourn in a foreign country, enriches one’s own\ncapacity for sharing the lyric mood. It is impossible, of course, that any\nrace or period should enter fully into the lyric impulses of another.\nEducated Englishmen have known their Horace for centuries, but it can be\nonly a half-knowledge, delightful as it is. France and England, so near in\nmiles, are still so far away in instinctive comprehension of each other’s\nmode of poetical utterance! No two nations have minds of quite the same\n“fringe.” No man, however complete a linguist, has more than one real\nmother tongue, and it is only in one’s mother tongue that a lyric\nsings with all its over-tones. And nevertheless, life offers few purer\npleasures than may be found in listening to the half-comprehended songs\nuttered by alien lips indeed, but from hearts that we know are like our\nown.",
        "  “This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone,\n  It seems to me there are other men in other lands\n     yearning and thoughtful,\n  It seems to me I can look over and behold them in\n     Germany, Italy, France, Spain,\n  Or far, far away, in China, or in Russia or Japan,\n     talking other dialects,\n  And it seems to me if I could know those men I\n     should become attached to them as I do to\n     men in my own lands,\n  O I know we should be brethren and lovers,\n  I know I should be happy with them.”",
        "9. A Test\nIf the reader is willing to test his own responsiveness, not to the alien\nvoices, but to singers of his own blood in other epochs, let him now read\naloud–or better, recite from memory–three of the best-known English\npoems: Milton’s “Lycidas,” Gray’s “Elegy” and Wordsworth’s “Ode to\nImmortality.” The first was published in 1638, the second in 1751, and the\nthird in 1817. Each is a “central” utterance of a race, a period and an\nindividual. Each is an open-air poem, written by a young Englishman; each\nis lyrical, elegiac–a song of mourning and of consolation. “Lycidas” is\nthe last flawless music of the English Renaissance, an epitome of\nclassical and pastoral convention, yet at once Christian, political and\npersonal. Beneath the quiet perfection of Gray’s “Elegy” there is the\nundertone of passionate sympathy for obscure lives: passionate, but\nrestrained. Wordsworth knows no restraint of form or feeling in\nhis great “Ode\"; its germinal idea is absurd to logic, but not to the\nimagination. This elegy, like the others, is a “lyric cry” of a man, an\nage, and a race; “enciphered” like them, with all the cunning of which the\nartist was capable; and decipherable only to those who know the language\nof the English lyric.",
        "There may be readers who find these immortal elegies wearisome, staled by\nrepetition, spoiled by the critical glosses of generations of\ncommentators. In that case, one may test his sense of race, period\nand personality by a single quatrain of Landor, who is surely not\nover-commented upon to-day:",
        "  “From you, Ianthe, little troubles pass\n  Like little ripples down a sunny river;\n  Your pleasures spring like daisies in the grass,\n  Cut down, and up again as blithe as ever.”",
        "Find the classicist, the aristocrat, the Englishman, and the lover in that\nquatrain!",
        "Or, if Landor seems too remote, turn to Amherst, Massachusetts, and read\nthis amazing elegy in a country churchyard written by a New England\nrecluse, Emily Dickinson:",
        "  “This quiet Dust was Gentlemen and Ladies,\n      And Lads and Girls;\n   Was laughter and ability and sighing,\n      And frocks and curls.\n   This passive place a Summer’s nimble mansion,\n      Where Bloom and Bees\n   Fulfilled their Oriental Circuit,\n      Then ceased like these.”",
