        "The Lowell family of Boston crossed over from England towards the middle\nof the seventeenth century. One of their number afterwards founded the\ncity of Lowell, by establishing manufactures on the Merrimac River, late\nin the eighteenth century; and in more recent times two members of the\nfamily have held the position of judge in the Supreme Court of\nMassachusetts. They are a family of refined intellectual tastes, as well\nas of good business and professional ability, but of a retiring\ndisposition and not often conspicuous in public life,—a family of\ngeneral good qualities, nicely balanced between liberal and conservative,\nand with a poetic vein running through it for the past hundred years or\nmore. In the Class of 1867 there was an Edward J. Lowell who was chosen\nclass odist, and who wrote poetry nearly, if not quite, as good as that\nof his distinguished relative at the same period of life.",
        "James Russell Lowell was born at Elmwood, as it is now called, on\nWashington’s birthday in 1819,—as if to make a good staunch patriot of\nhim; and, what is even more exceptional in American life, he lived and\ndied in the same house in which he was born. It was not such a house as\nthe Craigie mansion, but still spacious and dignified, and denoted very\nfair prosperity for those times.",
        "Elmwood itself extends for some thirty rods on Brattle Street, but the\nentrance to the house is on a cross-road which runs down to the marshes.\nBeyond Elmwood there is a stonecutter’s establishment, and next to that\nMount Auburn Cemetery, which, however, was a fine piece of woodland in\nLowell’s youth, called Sweet Auburn by the Harvard students, much\nfrequented by love-sick swains and strolling parties of youths and\nmaidens.",
        "The Lowell residence was well into the country at that time. There were\nfew houses near it, and Boston could only be reached by a long detour in\na stage; so that an expedition to the city exhausted the better part of a\nday. It was practically further in the country than Concord is at\npresent; and it was here that Lowell enjoyed that repose of mind which is\nessential to vigorous mental development, and could find such interests\nin external nature as the poet requires for the embellishment of his\nverse.",
        "He went to college at the age of fifteen, two years older than Edward\nEverett, but sufficiently young to prove himself a precocious student.\nCambridge boys of good families have always been noted at Harvard for\ntheir gentlemanly deportment. Besides this, Lowell had an immense fund of\nwit and good spirits, and the two together served to make him very\npopular—perhaps too much so for his immediate good. His father had\ngreat hopes of his promising son,—that he would prove a fine scholar and\ntake a prominent part in the commencement exercises. He even offered the\nboy a reward of two hundred dollars in case this should happen; but the\nattractions of student and social life proved too strong for James. He\nwas quick at languages, but slow in mathematics, and as for Butler’s\nanalogy he cannot be blamed for the aversion with which he regarded it.\nHe writes a letter in which he confesses to peeping over the professor’s\nshoulder to see what marks have been given for his recitations, so that\nhis father’s exhortation would seem at one time to have been seriously\nfelt by him; but the effort did not last long, and we find him repeatedly\nreprimanded for neglect of college duties.",
        "He did not live the life of a roaring blade, but more like the humming-\nbird that darts from one plant to another, and gathers sweetness from\nevery flower in the garden. Finally he was rusticated, just after he had\nbeen elected poet of his class, with directions not to return until\ncommencement. We recognize the Puritanic severity of President Quincy in\nthis sentence, which robbed young Lowell of the pleasantest term of\ncollege life, as well as the honor of appearing on the stage on Class\nDay. That his poem should have been read by another to the assembled\nfamilies of his classmates, served to make his absence more conspicuous.\nNor can we discover any sufficient reason for such hard statement.",
        "At the same age that Longfellow was writing for the United States\nLiterary Gazette, Lowell was scribbling verses for an undergraduates’\nperiodical called Harvardiana. They were not very serious\nproductions, and might all be included under the head of bric-a-brac; but\nthere was a-plenty of them. While Longfellow’s verse at nineteen was\nremarkable for its perfection of form, Lowell’s suffered chiefly from a\nlack of this. He had an idea that poetry ought to be an inspiration of\nthe moment; a good foundation to begin with, but which he found\nafterwards it was necessary to modify.",
        "In the preface to one of his Biglow Papers he speaks of his life in\nConcord as being",
        "The men whom he chiefly associated with there were named Barziliai and\nEbenezer, and the hoar frost of the Concord meadows would seem to have\nhad a chilling effect on Lowell’s naturally tolerant and amiable\ndisposition. He was not attracted by Emerson at this time, but, on the\ncontrary, would seem to have felt an aversion to him. The following lines\nin his class poem could not have referred to anyone else:",
        "To confound the strong spiritual assertion of Emerson with the purely\nnegative attitude of the French satirist was a common mistake in those\ndays, and the Lowell of 1838 needs small excuse for it. He must have been\nin a biting humor at this time, for there is a cut all round in his class\npoem, although it is the most vigorous and highly-finished production of\nhis academic years.",
        "After college came the law, in which he succeeded as well as youthful\nattorneys commonly do; and at the age of twenty-five he entered into the\nholy bonds of matrimony.",
        "The union of James Russell Lowell to Maria White, of Watertown, was the\nmost poetic marriage of the nineteenth century, and can only be compared\nto that of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning. Miss White was herself\na poetess, and full of poetical impulse to the brim. Maria would seem to\nhave been born in the White family as Albinos appear in Africa,—for the\nsake of contrast. She shone like a single star in a cloudy sky,—a pale,\nslender, graceful girl, with eyes, to use Herrick’s expression, “like a\ncrystal glasse.” A child was born where she did not belong, and Lowell\nwas the chivalrous knight who rescued her.",
        "It must have been Maria White who made an Emersonian of him. Margaret\nFuller had stirred up the intellectual life of New England women to a\ndegree never known before or since, and Miss White was one of those who\ncame within the scope of her influence. [Footnote: Lowell himself speaks\nof her as being “considered transcendental.\"] She studied German, and\ntranslated poems from Uhland, who might be called the German Longfellow.\nCertain it is that from the time of their marriage his opinions not only\nchanged from what they had been previously, but his ideas of poetry,\nphilosophy, and religion became more consistent and clearly defined. The\npath that she pointed out to him, or perhaps which they discovered\ntogether, was the one that he followed all through life; so that in one\nof his later poems, he said, half seriously, that he was ready to adopt\nEmerson’s creed if anyone could tell him just what it was.",
        "The life they lived together was a poem in itself, and reminds one of\nGoethe’s saying, that “he who is sufficiently provided for within has\nneed of little from without.” They were poor in worldly goods, but rich\nin affection, in fine thoughts, and courageous endeavor. It is said that\nwhen they were married Lowell had but five hundred dollars of his own.\nThey went to New York and Philadelphia, and soon discovering that they\nhad spent more than half of it, they concluded to return home.",
        "The next ten years of Lowell’s life might be called the making of the\nman. He worked hard and lived economically; earning what he could by the\nlaw, and what he could not by magazine writing, which paid poorly enough.\nPublishers had not then discovered that what the general public desires\nis not literature, but information on current topics, and this is the\nlast thing which the true man of letters is able to provide. A magazine\narticle, or a campaign biography of General Grant, could be written in a\nfew weeks, but a solid historical biography of him, with a critical\nexamination of his campaigns, has not yet been written, and perhaps never\nwill be. A literary venture of Lowell and his friends in 1843, to found a\nfirst-rate literary magazine, proved a failure; and it is to be feared\nthat he lost money by it. [Footnote: See Scudder’s Life of Lowell,\niii. 109.]",
        "However the world might use him he was sure of comfort and happiness at\nhis own fireside, where he read Shelley, and Keats, and Lessing, while\nMrs. Lowell studied upon her German translations. The sympathy of a true-\nhearted woman is always valuable, even when she does not quite understand\nthe grievance in question, but the sympathy that Maria Lowell could give\nher husband was of a rare sort. She could sympathize with him wholly in\nheart and intellect. She encouraged him to fresh endeavors and continual\nimprovement. Thus he went on year by year broadening his mind,\nstrengthening his faculties, and improving his reputation. The days of\nfrolicsome gaiety were over. He now lived in a more serious vein, and\nfelt a deeper, more satisfying happiness. It was much more the ideal life\nof a poet than that of Thoreau, paddling up and down Concord River in\nsearch of the inspiration which only comes when we do not think of it.",
        "It may be suspected that he read more literature than law during these\nyears, and we notice that he did not go, like Emerson, to the great\nfountain-heads of poetry,—to Homer or Dante, Shakespeare or Goethe,—but\ncourted the muse rather among such tributaries as Virgil, Moliere,\nChaucer, Keats, and Lessing. It may have been better for him that he\nbegan in this manner; but a remark that Scudder attributes to him in\nregard to Lessing gives us an insight into the deeper mechanism of his\nmind. “Shelley’s poetry,” he said, “was like the transient radiance of\nSt. Elmo’s fire, but Lessing was wholly a poet.” This is exactly the\nopposite of the view he held during his college life, for Lessing worked\nin a methodical and painstaking manner and finished what he wrote with\nthe greatest care.",
        "More than this, Lessing was as Lowell realized afterwards, too critical\nand polemical to be wholly a poet. His “Emilia Galotti” still holds a\nhigh position on the German stage and has fine poetic qualities, but it\nis written in prose. His “Nathan the Wise” was written in verse, but did\nnot prove a success as a drama. In one he attacked the tyranny of the\nGerman petty princes, and in the other the intolerance of the Established\nChurch. We may assume that is the reason why Lowell admired them; but\nLowell was also too critical and polemic to be wholly a poet,—except on\ncertain occasions. In 1847 he published the “Fable for Critics,” the\nkeenest piece of poetical satire since Byron’s “English Bards and Scotch\nReviewers,\"—keen and even saucy, but perfectly good-humored. About the\nsame time he commenced his “Biglow Papers,” which did not wholly cease\nuntil 1866, and were the most incisive and aggressive anti-slavery\nliterature of that period. Soon afterwards he wrote “The Vision of Sir\nLaunfal,” which has become the most widely known of all his poems, and\nwhich contains passages of the purest a priori verse. Goethe, who\nexercised so powerful an influence on Emerson, does not appear to have\ninterested Lowell at all.",
        "The most plaintive of Beethoven scherzos,—that in the Moonlight Sonata,\n—says as if it were spoken in words:",
        "Lowell’s poetic marriage did not last quite ten years. Maria White was\nalways frail and delicate, and she became more so continually.\nLongfellow’s clear foresight noticed the danger she was in years before\nher death, which took place in the autumn of 1853. She left one child,\nMabel Lowell, slender and pale like herself, and with poetical lines in\nher face, too, but fortunately endowed with her father’s good\nconstitution. Only ten years! But such ten years, worth ten centuries of\nthe life of a girl of fashion, who thinks she is happy because she has\neverything she wants. If the truth were known we might find that in the\ntwilight of his life Lowell thought more of these ten years with Maria\nWhite than of the six years when he was Ambassador to England,—with\ntwenty-nine dinner-parties in the month of June.",
        "What would poets do without war? The Trojan war, or some similar\nconflict, served as the ground-work of Homer’s mighty epic; Virgil\nfollowed in similar lines; Dante would never have been famous but for the\nGuelph and Ghibeline struggle. Shakespeare’s plays are full of war and\nfighting; and the wars of Napoleon stimulated Byron, Schiller, and Goethe\nto the best efforts of their lives. In dealing with men like Emerson,\nLongfellow, and Lowell, who were the intellectual leaders of their time,\nit is impossible to escape their influence in the anti-slavery movement,\nand its influence upon them, unpopular as that subject is at present.\nThat was the heroic age of American history, and the truth concerning it\nhas not yet been written. It was as heroic to the South as to the North,\nfor, as Sumner said, the slaveholders would never have made their\ndesperate attack on the Government of this country if they had not been\nthemselves the slaves of their own social organization.",
        "It was the solution of a great historical problem, like that of\nConstitutional Government versus the Stuarts, and it ought to be\ntreated from a national and not a sectional stand-point.",
        "The live men of that time became abolitionists as inevitably as their\nforefathers became supporters of the Declaration of Independence. If\nWebster and Everett had been born twenty years later, they must needs\nhave become anti-slavery, too. Those of Lowell’s friends, like George S.\nHillard and George B. Loring, who for social or political reasons took\nthe opposite side, afterwards found themselves left in the lurch by an\nadverse public opinion.",
        "It was the Mexican war that first aroused Lowell to the seriousness of\nthe extension of slavery, and it was meeting a recruiting officer in the\nstreets of Boston, “covered all over with brass let alone that which\nnature had set on his countenance,” which inspired his writing the\nfirst of the “Biglow Papers.” They were hastily and carelessly written,\nand Lowell himself held them in slight estimation as literature; but they\nbecame immediately popular, as no poetry had that he had published\npreviously. Their freshness and directness appealed to the manliness and\ngood sense of the average New Englander, and the whole community\nresponded to them with repeated applause. There is, after all, much\npoetry in the Biglow Papers, the more genuine because unintentional; but\nthey are full of the keenest wit and a proverbial philosophy which, if\nless profound than Emerson’s, is more capable of a practical application.",
        "The vernacular in which they are written must have been learned at\nConcord,—perhaps on the front stoop of the Middlesex Hotel,—while\nLowell was listening to the pithy conversation of Yankee farmers, not\nonly about their crops and cattle, but also discussing church affairs and\npolitics, local and national. It was the grandfathers of these men who\ndrove the British back from Concord bridge, and it was their sons who\nfought their way from the Rapidan to Richmond. With the help of country\nlawyers they sent Sumner and Wilson to the Senate, and knew what they\nwere about when they did this. For wit, humor, and repartee,—and, it may\nbe added, for decent conversation,—there is no class of men like them.\nBoth Lowell and Emerson have testified to their intrinsic worth.",
        "On one occasion a Concord farmer was driving a cow past Sanborn’s school-\nhouse, when an impudent boy called out, “The calf always follows the\ncow.” “Why aren’t you behind here, then?” retorted the man, with a look\nthat went home like the stroke of a cane. If Lowell had been present he\nwould have been delighted.",
        "The Yankee dialect which he makes use of as a vehicle in these verses is\nnot always as clear-cut as it might be. He says, for instance,",
        "The true New England countryman never flattens a vowel; if he changes it\nhe always makes it sharp. He would be more likely to say: “Pleasure does\nmake us Yankee kind er winch, as if ’twas suthin’ paid for by the inch.\"\nThere are other instances of similar sort; but, nevertheless, if the\nprimitive Yankee should become extinct, as now seems very probable,\nLowell’s masterly portrait of him will remain, and future generations can\nreconstruct him from it, as Agassiz reconstructed an extinct species of\nmammal from fossil bones.",
        "Lowell did not join the Free-soilers, who were now bearing the brunt of\nthe anti-slavery conflict, but attached himself to the more aristocratic\nwing of the old abolitionists, which was led by Edmund Quincy, Maria\nChapman, and L. Maria Child. Lowell was far from being a non-resistant.\nIn fact, he might be called a fighting-man, although he disapproved of\nduelling; and this served to keep him at a distance from Garrison, of\nwhom he wisely remarked that “the nearer public opinion approached to him\nthe further he retreated into the isolation of his own private opinions.\"\nHe wrote regularly for the Anti-Slavery Standard until 1851, when\nthe death of his father-in-law supplied the long-desired means for a\njourney to Italy,—more desired perhaps for his wife’s health than for\nhis own gratification. It may be the fault of his biographers, but I\ncannot discover that Lowell took any share in the opposition to the\nFugitive Slave bill, or in the election of Sumner, which was the signal\nevent that followed it. In his whole life Lowell never made the\nacquaintance of a practical statesman, while Whittier was in constant\ncommunication with prominent members of the Free-soil and Republican\nparties. Sumner went to hear Lowell’s lecture on Milton, and praised it\nas a work of genius.",
        "I have heard the “Vision of Sir Launfal” spoken of more frequently than\nany other of Lowell’s poems. Some of the descriptive passages in it would\nseem to have flowed from his pen as readily as ink from a quill; and\nthere are others which appear to have been evolved with much thought and\ningenuity. One cannot help feeling the sudden change from a June morning\nat Elmwood to a mediaeval castle in Europe as somewhat abrupt; but when\nwe think of it subjectively as a poetic vision which came to Lowell\nhimself seated on his own door-step, this disillusion vanishes, and we\nsympathize heartily with the writer. There is no place in the world where\nJune seems so beautiful as in New England, on account of the dismal,\ncutthroat weather in the months that precede it. Perhaps it is so in\nreality; for what nature makes us suffer from at one time she commonly\natones for it another.",
        "The “Fable for Critics” is written in an easy, nonchalant manner, which\nhelps to mitigate its severity. Thoreau could not have liked very well\nbeing called an imitator of Emerson; but the wit of it is inimitable. “T.\nnever purloins the apples from Emerson’s trees; it is only the windfalls\nthat he carries off and passes for his own fruit.” Emerson remarked on\nthis, that Thoreau was sufficiently original in his own way; and he\nalways spoke of Lowell in a friendly and appreciative manner. The whole\npoem is filled with such homely comparisons, which hit the nail exactly\non the head. The most subtle piece of analysis, however, is Lowell’s\ncomparison between Emerson and Carlyle:",
        "It was the fashion in England at that time to disparage Emerson as an\nimitator of Carlyle; and this was Lowell’s reply to it.",
        "He told Professor Hedge an amusing incident that happened during his\nfirst visit to Rome. Lowell and his wife took lodgings with a respectable\nelderly Italian woman whose husband was in a sickly condition. One\nmorning she met him in the passageway with tearful eyes and said: “Un\ngran’ disgrazie happened last night,—my poor husband went to\nheaven.” Lowell wondered why there was a pope in Rome if going to heaven\nwas considered a disgrace there.",
        "Longfellow’s resignation of his professorship at Harvard was a rare piece\nof good fortune for Lowell; for it was the only position of the kind that\nhe could have obtained there or anywhere else. In fact, it was a question\nwhether the appointment would be confirmed on account of his\ntranscendental tendencies, and his connection with the Anti-slavery\nStandard; but Longfellow threw the whole weight of his influence in\nLowell’s favor, and this would seem to have decided it. From this time\ntill 1873 Lowell was more of a prose-writer than a poet, and his essays\non Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, and other English poets are the best of\ntheir kind,—not brilliant, but appreciative, penetrating, and well-\nconsidered. Wasson said of him that no other critic in the English tongue\ncame so near to expressing the inexpressible as Lowell.",
        "One could wish that his studies in Shakespeare had been more extended. He\ntreats the subject as if he felt it was too great for him; but he was the\nfirst to take notice that the play of Richard III. indicated in its\nmain extent a different hand, and it is now generally admitted to have\nbeen the work of Fletcher. With the keenest insight he noticed that the\nmagician Prospero was an impersonation of Shakespeare himself; and George\nBrandes, the most thoroughgoing of Shakespearean scholars, afterwards\ncame to the same conclusion.",
        "Lowell was the gentlemanly instructor. He appealed to the gentleman in\nthe students who sat before him, and he rarely appealed in vain. Like\nLongfellow he carried an atmosphere of politeness about him, which was\nsufficient to protect him from everything rude and common. He would say\nto his class in Italian: “I shall not mark you if you are tardy, but I\nhope you will all be here on time.” This was a safer procedure with a\nsmall division of Juniors than it would have been with a large division\nof Freshmen or Sophomores. Neither did he take much personal interest in\nhis classes. He always invited them to an entertainment at Elmwood in\nJune, but two or three years later he could not remember their faces\nunless they remained in or about Cambridge. In regard to his efficiency\nas an instructor and lecturer there was a difference of opinion.",
        "He attended the meetings of the college faculty quite regularly\nconsidering the distance of Elmwood from the college grounds; and he was\nonce heard to say that there seemed to be more bad weather on Monday\nnights than at any other time in the week. His presence might have been\ndispensed with for the most part. He rarely spoke in conclave, and when\nthe question came up in regard to the suspension of students he often\ndeclined to vote. His decorum was perfect, but now and then a humorous\nlook could be observed in his eyes, and it may be suspected that he had a\nquiet laugh all to himself on the way homeward. On one occasion, before\nthe meeting had been called to order, Professor Cutler said to him: “Do\nyou not dread B.’s forthcoming translation of the Iliad?” But Lowell,\nseeing that he was watched, replied: “Oh, no, not at all,” at the same\ntime nodding to Cutler with his brows.",
        "He was always well-dressed, and pretty close to the conventional in his\nways,—noted specially for the nicety of his gloves. This was a kind of\nsafeguard to him. Insidious persons suggested that he perfumed his beard,\nbut I do not believe it. He does not appear to have been fond of walking,\nfor we never met him in any part of Cambridge except on the direct road\nfrom Elmwood to the college gate. He had a characteristic gait of his\nown—walking slowly in rather a dreamy manner, and keeping time to the\nmovement of his feet with his arms and shoulders. He was not, however,\nlost in contemplation, for he often scrutinized those who passed him as\nclosely as a portrait painter might.",
        "If one could meet Lowell in a fairly empty horse-car, he would be quite\nsociable and entertaining; but if the horse-car filled up, he would\nbecome reticent again. He clung to his old friends, his classmates, and\nothers with whom he had grown up, and did not easily make new ones. The\nmodesty of his ambition is conspicuous in the fact that he was quite\nsatisfied with the small salary paid him by the college,—at first only\ntwelve hundred dollars. He evidently did not care for luxury.",
        "Lowell’s second marriage was as simple and inevitable as the first. Miss\nDunlap was not an ordinary housekeeper, but the sister of one of Maria\nLowell’s most intimate friends, and she was such a pleasant, attractive\nlady that the wonder is rather he should have waited four years before\nconcluding to offer himself. She was compared to the Greek bust called\nClyte, because her hair grew so low down upon her forehead, and this was\nconsidered an additional charm.",
        "Louisa Alcott had a story that at first she refused Lowell’s offer on\naccount of what people might say; and that then he composed a poem\nanswering her objections in the form of an allegory, and that this\nfinally convinced her. If he had considered material interests he would\nhave married differently.",
        "In November, 1857, the firm of Phillips & Sampson issued the first number\nof the Atlantic Monthly in the cause of high-minded literature,—a\ncause which ultimately proved to be their ruin. Lowell accepted the\nposition of editor, and such a periodical as it proved to be under his\nguidance could not have been found in England, and perhaps not in the\nwhole of Europe; but it could not be made to pay, and two years later\nPhillips & Sampson failed,—partly on that account, and partially the\nvictims of a piratical opposition.",
        "Lowell published Emerson’s “Brahma” in spite of the shallow ridicule with\nwhich he foresaw it would be greeted; but when Emerson sent him his “Song\nof Nature” he returned it on account of the single stanza:",
        "which he declared was more than the Atlantic could be held\nresponsible for. Emerson, who really knew little as to what the public\nthought of him, was for once indignant. He said: “I did not know who had\nconstituted Mr. Lowell my censor, and I carried the verses to Miss\nCaroline Hoar, who read them and said, that she considered those four\nlines the best in the piece.” He permitted Lowell, however, to publish\nthe poem without them, as may be seen by examining the pages of the\nAtlantic, and afterwards published the original copy in his “May\nDay.”",
        "Lowell’s editorship of the North American Review, which followed\nafter this, was not so successful. It was chiefly a political magazine at\nthat time, and to understand politics in a large way—that is,\nsufficiently to write on the subject—one must not only be a close\nobserver of public affairs, but also a profound student of history; and\nLowell was neither. He was not acquainted with prominent men in public\nlife, and depended too much on information derived at dinner-parties, or\nsimilar occasions. During the war period Sumner, Wilson, and Andrew were\nalmost omnipotent in Massachusetts, for the three worked together in a\ncommon cause; but power always engenders envy and so an inside opposition\ngrew up within the Republican party to which Lowell lent his assistance\nwithout being aware of its true character. His articles in the North\nAmerican on public affairs were severely criticised by Andrew and\nWilson, while Frank W. Bird frankly called them “giving aid and comfort\nto the enemy.” It was certainly a doubtful course to pursue at such a\ncritical juncture—when all patriots should have been united—and it\noffended a good many Republicans without conciliating the opposition.\nLowell’s successor in this editorial chair was an old Webster Whig who\nhad become a Democrat.",
        "In 1873 he resigned his professorship and went to Italy for a holiday. He\nsaid to some friends whom he met in Florence: “I am tired of being called\nProfessor Lowell, and I want to be plain Mr. Lowell again. Eliot wanted\nto keep my name on the catalogue for the honor of the university, but I\ndid not like the idea.” This was true republicanism and worthy of a poet.",
        "Lowell was little known on the continent, and he travelled in a quiet,\nunostentatious manner. He went to dine with his old friends, but avoided\nintroductions, and remained at Florence nearly two months after other\nAmericans had departed for Rome. The reason he alleged for this was that\nRome was a mouldy place and the ruins made him feel melancholy; also,\nbecause he preferred oil paintings to frescos. He had just come from\nVenice, and spoke with enthusiasm of the mighty works of Tintoretto,—\nespecially his small painting of the Visitation, above the landing of the\nstaircase in the Scuola of San Rocco. He did not like the easel-paintings\nof Raphael on account of their hard outlines; those in the Vatican did\nhim better justice. This idea he may have derived from William Morris\nHunt, the Boston portrait-painter. He considered the action of the Niobe\ngroup too strenuous to be represented in marble.",
        "Miss Mary Felton liked the Niobe statues; so Lowell said, “Now come back\nwith me, and I will sit on you.” Accordingly we all returned to the Niobe\nhall, where Lowell lectured us on the statues without, however, entirely\nconvincing Miss Felton. Then we went to the hall in the Uffizi Palace,\nwhich is called the Tribune. Mrs. Lowell had never been in the\nTribune, where the Venus de’ Medici is enshrined; so her husband\nopened the door wide and said, “Now go in\"—as if he were opening the\ngates of Paradise.",
        "At Bologna he wished to make an excursion into the mountains, but the\n100 veturino charged about twice the usual price, and though the man\nafterwards reduced his demand to a reasonable figure Lowell would not go\nwith him at all, and told him that such practices made Americans dislike\nthe Italian people. It is to be feared that a strange Italian might fare\njust as badly in America.",
        "Readers of Lowell’s “Fireside Travels” will have noticed that the first\nof them is addressed to the “Edelmann Storg” in Rome. The true translation\nof this expression is “Nobleman Story;” that is, William W. Story,\nthe sculptor, who modelled the statue of Edward Everett in the Boston\npublic garden. Lowell’s biographer, however, does not appear to have\nbeen aware of the full significance of this paraphrase of Story’s name.",
        "When King Bomba II. was expelled from Naples by Garibaldi he retired to\nRome with his private possessions, including a large number of oil\npaintings. Wishing to dispose of some of these, and being aware that\nAmericans paid good prices, he applied to William Story to transact the\nbusiness for him. This the sculptor did in a satisfactory manner;\nwhereupon King Bomba, instead of rewarding Story with a cheque, conferred\non him a patent of nobility. It seems equally strange that Story should\nhave accepted such a dubious honor, and that Lowell should recognize it.",
        "On his return to Cambridge the following year, Lowell found himself a\ngrandfather, his daughter having married a gentleman farmer in Worcester\ncounty. He was greatly delighted, and wrote to E. L. Godkin, editor of\nThe Nation:",
        "“If you wish to taste the real bouquet of life, I advise you to procure\nyourself a grandson, whether by adoption or theft.... Get one, and the\nNation will no longer offend anybody.” [Footnote: Scudder’s\nbiography, ii., 186.]",
        "This was a pretty broad hint, but E. L. Godkin was not the man to pay\nmuch attention to the advice of Lowell or anybody. In fact, he seems to\nhave won Lowell over after this to his own way of thinking.",
        "Lowell certainly became more conservative with age. He did not support\nthe movement for negro citizenship, and had separated himself in a manner\nfrom the other New England poets. After 1872 Longfellow saw little of\nhim, except on state occasions. In 1876 he made a political address that\nshowed that if he had not already gone over to the Democratic party he\nwas very close upon the line. Charles Francis Adams had already gone over\nto Tilden, and had carried the North American Review with him. It\nwould not do to lose Lowell also, so the Republican leaders hit upon the\nshrewd device of nominating him as a presidential elector, an honor which\nhe could not very well decline. When the disputed election of Hayes and\nTilden came, Godkin proposed that, in order to prevent “Mexicanizing the\ngovernment,” one of the Hayes electors should cast his vote for General\nBristow, which would throw the election of President into the House of\nRepresentatives; and he endeavored to persuade Lowell to do this. Lowell\nwent so far as to take legal advice on the subject, but his counsellor\ninformed him that since the election of John Quincy Adams it had been\nvirtually decided that an elector must cast his vote according to the\nticket on which he was chosen. When the electors met at the Parker House\nin January, 1877, Lowell deposited his ballot for Hayes and Wheeler, and\nthe slight applause that followed showed that his colleagues were\nconscious of the position he had assumed.",
        "When President Hayes appointed Lowell to be Minister to Spain, Lowell\nremarked that he did not see why it should have come to him. It really\ncame to him through his friend E. E. Hoar, of Concord, who was brother-\nin-law to Secretary Evarts. His friends wondered that he should accept\nthe position, but the truth was that Lowell at this time was\ncomparatively poor. His taxes had increased, and his income had\ndiminished. He complained to C. P. Cranch that the whole profit from the\nsale of his books during the preceding year was less than a hundred\ndollars, and he thought there ought to be a law for the protection of\nauthors. The real trouble was hard times.",
        "He did not like Madrid, and at the end of a year wrote that it seemed\nimpossible for him to endure the life there any longer. Evarts gave him a\nvacation, and at the end of the second year Hayes promoted him to the\nCourt of St. James.",
        "Such an appointment would have been dangerous enough in 1861, but at the\ntime it was made the relations between the United States and Great\nBritain were sufficiently peaceable to warrant it. Lowell represented his\ncountry in a highly creditable manner. The only difficulty he experienced\nwas with the Fenian agitation, and he managed that with such diplomatic\ntact that no one has yet been able to discover whether he was in favor of\nhome rule for Ireland or not.",
        "He made a number of excellent addresses in England, besides a multitude\nof after-dinner speeches. Perhaps the best of them was his address at the\nColeridge celebration, in which he levelled an attack on the English\ncanonization of what they call “common sense,” but which is really a new\nname for dogmatism. Lowell, if not a transcendentalist, was always an\nidealist, and he knew that ideality was as necessary to Cromwell and\nCanning as it was to Shakespeare and Scott.",
        "He was certainly more popular in England than he had ever been in\nAmerica, and he openly admitted that he disliked to resign his position.\nProfessor Child said, in 1882: “Lowell’s conversation is witty, with a\nbasis of literary cramming; and that seems to be what the English like.\nHe went to twenty-nine dinner parties in the month of June, and made a\nspeech at each one of them.”",
        "In the last years of his life he was greatly infested with imitators who,\nas he said of Emerson in the “Fable for Critics,” stole his fruit and\nthen brought it back to him on their own dishes. Some of them were too\ninfluential to be easily disposed of, and others did not know when they\nwere rebuffed. An old man, failing in strength and vigor, he had to\nendure them as best he could.",
        "The story of Lowell’s visions rests on a single authority, and if there\nwas any truth in it, it seems probable that he would have confided the\nfact to more intimate friends. There are well-authenticated instances of\nvisions seen by persons in a waking condition—this always happens, for\ninstance, in delirium tremens—but they are sure to indicate\nnervous derangement, and are commonly followed by death. If there was\never a poet with a sound mind and a sound body, it was James Russell\nLowell.",
        "Edwin Arnold considered him the best of American poets, while Matthew\nArnold did not like him at all. Emerson, in his last years, preferred him\nto Longfellow, but it is doubtful if he always did so. The strong point\nof his poetry is its intelligent manliness,—the absence of affectation\nand all sentimentality; but it lacks the musical element. He composed\nneither songs nor ballads,—nothing to match Hiawatha, or Gray’s famous\nElegy. America still awaits a poet who shall combine the savoir\nfaire of Lowell with the force of Emerson and the grace and purity of\nLongfellow.",
        "Emerson had an advantage over his literary contemporaries in the vigorous\nlife he lived. You feel in his writing the energy of necessity. The\nacademic shade is not favorable to the cultivation of genius, and Lowell\nreclined under it too much. His best work was already performed before he\nbecame a professor. What he lacks as a poet, however, he compensates for\nas a wit. He is the best of American humorists—there are few who will be\ninclined to dispute that—even though we regret occasional cynicisms,\nlike his jest on Milton’s blindness in “Fireside Travels.”",
