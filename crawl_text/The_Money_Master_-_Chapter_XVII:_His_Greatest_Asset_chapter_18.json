        "Jean Jacques did not go to the house of the widow of Palass Poucette\n“next day” as he had proposed: and she did not expect him.  She had seen\nhis flour-mill burned to the ground on the-evening when they met in the\noffice of the Clerk of the evening Court, when Jean Jacques had learned\nthat his Zoe had gone into farther and farther places away from him.\nPerhaps Virginie Poucette never had shed as many tears in any whole year\nof her life as she did that night, not excepting the year Palass Poucette\ndied, and left her his farm and seven horses, more or less sound, and a\nthreshing-machine in good condition.  The woman had a rare heart and\nthere was that about Jean Jacques which made her want to help him.  She\nhad no clear idea as to how that could be done, but she had held his hand\nat any rate, and he had seemed the better for it.  Virginie had only an\nobjective view of things; and if she was not material, still she could\nbest express herself through the medium of the senses.",
        "There were others besides her who shed tears also–those who saw Jean\nJacques’ chief asset suddenly disappear in flame and smoke and all his\nother assets become thereby liabilities of a kind; and there were many\nwho would be the poorer in the end because of it.  If Jean Jacques went\ndown, he probably would not go alone.  Jean Jacques had done a good fire-\ninsurance business over a course of years, but somehow he had not insured\nhimself as heavily as he ought to have done; and in any case the fire-\npolicy for the mill was not in his own hands.  It was in the safe-keeping\nof M. Mornay at Montreal, who had warned M. Fille of the crisis in the\nmoney-master’s affairs on the very day that the crisis came.",
        "No one ever knew how it was that the mill took fire, but there was one\nman who had more than a shrewd suspicion, though there was no occasion\nfor mentioning it.  This was Sebastian Dolores.  He had not set the mill\nafire.  That would have been profitable from no standpoint, and he had no\ngrudge against Jean Jacques.  Why should he have a grudge?  Jean Jacques’\ngood fortune, as things were, made his own good fortune; for he ate and\ndrank and slept and was clothed at his son-in-law’s expense.  But he\nguessed accurately who had set the mill on fire, and that it was done\naccidentally.  He remembered that a man who smoked bad tobacco which had\nto be lighted over and over again, threw a burning match down after\napplying it to his pipe.  He remembered that there was a heap of flour-\nbags near where the man stood when the match was thrown down; and that\nsome loose strings for tying were also in a pile beside the bags.  So it\nwas easy for the thing to have happened if the man did not turn round\nafter he threw the match down, but went swaying on out of the mill, and\nover to the Manor Cartier, and up staggering to bed; for he had been\ndrinking potato-brandy, and he had been brought up on the mild wines of\nSpain!  In other words, the man who threw down the lighted match which\ndid the mischief was Sebastian Dolores himself.",
        "He regretted it quite as much as he had ever regretted anything; and on\nthe night of the fire there were tears in his large brown eyes which\ndeceived the New Cure and others; though they did not deceive the widow\nof Palass Poucette, who had found him out, and who now had no pleasure at\nall in his aged gallantries.  But the regret Dolores experienced would\nnot prevent him from doing Jean Jacques still greater injury if, and\nwhen, the chance occurred, should it be to his own advantage.",
        "Jean Jacques shed no tears on the night that his beloved flour-mill\nbecame a blackened ruin, and his saw-mill had a narrow escape.  He was\nlike one in a dream, scarcely realizing that men were saying kind things\nto him; that the New Cure held his hand and spoke to him more like a\nbrother than one whose profession it was to be good to those who\nsuffered.  In his eyes was the same half-rapt, intense, distant look\nwhich came into them when, at Vilray, he saw that red reflection in the\nsky over against St. Saviour’s, and urged his horses onward.",
        "The world knew that the burning of the mill was a blow to Jean Jacques,\nbut it did not know how great and heavy the blow was.  First one and then\nanother of his friends said he was insured, and that in another six\nmonths the mill-wheel would be turning again.  They said so to Jean\nJacques when he stood with his eyes fixed on the burning fabric, which\nnothing could save; but he showed no desire to speak.  He only nodded and\nkept on staring at the fire with that curious underglow in his eyes.\nSome chemistry of the soul had taken place in him in the hour when he\ndrove to the Manor Cartier from Vilray, and it produced a strange fire,\nwhich merged into the reflection of the sky above the burning mill.\nLater, came things which were strange and eventful in his life, but that\nunder-glow was for ever afterwards in his eyes.  It was in singular\ncontrast to the snapping fire which had been theirs all the days of his\nlife till now–the snapping fire of action, will and design.  It still\nwas there when they said to him suddenly that the wind had changed, and\nthat the flame and sparks were now blowing toward the saw-mill.  Even\nwhen he gave orders, and set to work to defend the saw-mill, arranging a\nline of men with buckets on its roof, and so saving it, this look\nremained.  It was something spiritual and unmaterial, something, maybe,\nwhich had to do with the philosophy he had preached, thought and\npractised over long years.  It did not disappear when at last, after\nmidnight, everyone had gone, and the smouldering ruins of his greatest\nasset lay mournful in the wan light of the moon.",
        "Kind and good friends like the Clerk of the Court and the New Cure had\nseen him to his bedroom at midnight, leaving him there with a promise\nthat they would come on the morrow; and he had said goodnight evenly, and\nhad shut the door upon them with a sort of smile.  But long after they\nhad gone, when Sebastian Dolores and Seraphe Corniche were asleep, he had\ngot up again and left the house, to gaze at the spot where the big white\nmill with the red roof had been-the mill which had been there in the days\nof the Baron of Beaugard, and to which time had only added size and\nadornment.  The gold-cock weathervane of the mill, so long the admiration\nof people living and dead, and indeed the symbol of himself, as he had\nbeen told, being so full of life and pride, courage and vigour-it lay\namong the ruins, a blackened relic of the Barbilles.",
        "He had said in M. Fille’s office not many hours before, “I will fight it\nall out alone,” and here in the tragic quiet of the night he made his\nresolve a reality.  In appearance he was not now like the “Seigneur” who\nsang to the sailors on the Antoine when she was fighting for the shore of\nGaspe; nevertheless there was that in him which would keep him much the\nsame man to the end.",
        "Indeed, as he got into bed that fateful night he said aloud: “They shall\nsee that I am not beaten.  If they give me time up there in Montreal I’ll\nkeep the place till Zoe comes back–till Zoe comes home.”",
        "As he lay and tried to sleep, he kept saying over to himself, “Till Zoe\ncomes home.”",
        "He thought that if he could but have Zoe back, it all would not matter so\nmuch.  She would keep looking at him and saying, “There’s the man that\nnever flinched when things went wrong; there’s the man that was a friend\nto everyone.”",
        "At last a thought came to him–the key to the situation as it seemed, the\none thing necessary to meet the financial situation.  He would sell the\nbiggest farm he owned, which had been to him in its importance like the\nflour-mill itself.  He had had an offer for it that very day, and a\nbigger offer still a week before.  It was mortgaged to within eight\nthousand dollars of what it could be sold for but, if he could gain time,\nthat eight thousand dollars would build the mill again.  M. Mornay, the\nBig Financier, would certainly see that this was his due–to get his\nchance to pull things straight.  Yes, he would certainly sell the\nBarbille farm to-morrow.  With this thought in his mind he went to sleep\nat last, and he did not wake till the sun was high.",
        "It was a sun of the most wonderful brightness and warmth.  Yesterday it\nwould have made the Manor Cartier and all around it look like Arcady.\nBut as it shone upon the ruins of the mill, when Jean Jacques went out\ninto the working world again, it made so gaunt and hideous a picture\nthat, in spite of himself, a cry of misery came from his lips.",
        "Through all the misfortunes which had come to him the outward semblance\nof things had remained, and when he went in and out of the plantation of\nthe Manor Cartier, there was no physical change in the surroundings,\nwhich betrayed the troubles and disasters fallen upon its overlord.\nThere it all was just as it had ever been, and seeming to deny that\nanything had changed in the lives of those who made the place other than\na dead or deserted world.  When Carmen went, when Zoe fled, when his\ncousin Auguste Charron took his flight, when defeats at law abashed him,\nthe house and mills, and stores and offices, and goodly trees, and well-\nkept yards and barns and cattle-sheds all looked the same.  Thus it was\nthat he had been fortified.  In one sense his miseries had seemed unreal,\nbecause all was the same in the outward scene.  It was as though it all\nsaid to him: “It is a dream that those you love have vanished, that ill-\nfortune sits by your fireside.  One night you will go to bed thinking\nthat wife and child have gone, that your treasury is nearly empty; and in\nthe morning you will wake up and find your loved ones sitting in their\naccustomed places, and your treasury will be full to overflowing as of\nold.”",
        "So it was while the picture of his home scene remained unbroken and\nserene; but the hideous mass of last night’s holocaust was now before his\neyes, with little streams of smoke rising from the cindered pile, and\na hundred things with which his eyes had been familiar lay distorted,\nexcoriated and useless.  He realized with sudden completeness that a\nterrible change bad come in his life, that a cyclone had ruined the face\nof his created world.",
        "This picture did more to open up Jean Jacques’ eyes to his real position\nin life than anything he had experienced, than any sorrow he had\nsuffered.  He had been in torment in the past, but he had refused to see\nthat he was in Hades.  Now it was as though he had been led through the\nstreets of Hell by some dark spirit, while in vain he looked round for\nhis old friends Kant and Hegel, Voltaire and Rousseau and Rochefoucauld,\nPlato and Aristotle.",
        "While gazing at the dismal scene, however, and unheeding the idlers who\npoked about among the ruins, and watched him as one who was the centre of\na drama, he suddenly caught sight of the gold Cock of Beaugard, which had\nstood on the top of the mill, in the very centre of the ruins.",
        "Yes, there it was, the crested golden cock which had typified his own\nlife, as he went head high, body erect, spurs giving warning, and a\nclarion in his throat ready to blare forth at any moment.  There was the\ngolden Cock of Beaugard in the cinders, the ashes and the dust.  His chin\ndropped on his breast, and a cloud like a fog on the coast of Gaspe\nsettled round him.  Yet even as his head drooped, something else\nhappened–one of those trivial things which yet may be the pivot of great\nthings.  A cock crowed–almost in his very ear, it seemed.  He lifted his\nhead quickly, and a superstitious look flashed into his face.  His eyes\nfastened on the burnished head of the Cock among the ruins.  To his\nexcited imagination it was as though the ancient symbol of the Barbilles\nhad spoken to him in its own language of good cheer and defiance.  Yes,\nthere it was, half covered by the ruins, but its head was erect in the\nmidst of fire and disaster.  Brought low, it was still alert above the\nwreckage.  The child, the dreamer, the optimist, the egoist, and the man\nalive in Jean Jacques sprang into vigour again.  It was as though the\nCock of Beaugard had really summoned him to action, and the crowing had\nnot been that of a barnyard bantam not a hundred feet away from him.\nJean Jacques’ head went up too.",
        "“Me–I am what I always was, nothing can change me,” he exclaimed\ndefiantly.  “I will sell the Barbille farm and build the mill again.”",
        "So it was that by hook or by crook, and because the Big Financier had\nmore heart than he even acknowledged to his own wife, Jean Jacques did\nsell the Barbille farm, and got in cash–in good hard cash-eight thousand\ndollars after the mortgage was paid.  M. Mornay was even willing to take\nthe inadequate indemnity of the insurance policy on the mill, and lose\nthe rest, in order that Jean Jacques should have the eight thousand\ndollars to rebuild.  This he did because Jean Jacques showed such amazing\ncourage after the burning of the mill, and spread himself out in a\ngreater activity than his career had yet shown.  He shaved through this\nfinancial crisis, in spite of the blow he had received by the loss of his\nlawsuits, the flitting of his cousin, Auguste Charron, and the farm debts\nof this same cousin.  It all meant a series of manipulations made\npossible by the apparent confidence reposed in him by M. Mornay.",
        "On the day he sold his farm he was by no means out of danger of absolute\ninsolvency–he was in fact ruined; but he was not yet the victim of those\nprocesses which would make him legally insolvent.  The vultures were\nhovering, but they had not yet swooped, and there was the Manor saw-mill\ngoing night and day; for by the strangest good luck Jean Jacques received\nan order for M. Mornay’s new railway (Judge Carcasson was behind that)\nwhich would keep his saw-mill working twenty-four hours in the day for\nsix months.",
        "“I like his pluck, but still, ten to one, he loses,” remarked M. Mornay\nto Judge Carcasson.  “He is an unlucky man, and I agree with Napoleon\nthat you oughtn’t to be partner with an unlucky man.”",
        "“Yet you have had to do with Monsieur Jean Jacques,” responded the aged\nJudge.",
        "M. Mornay nodded indulgently.",
        "“Yes, without risk, up to the burning of the mill.  Now I take my\nchances, simply because I’m a fool too, in spite of all the wisdom I see\nin history and in life’s experiences.  I ought to have closed him up, but\nI’ve let him go on, you see.”",
        "“You will not regret it,” remarked the Judge.  “He really is worth it.”",
        "“But I think I will regret it financially.  I think that this is the last\nflare of the ambition and energy of your Jean Jacques.  That often\nhappens–a man summons up all his reserves for one last effort.  It’s\npartly pride, partly the undefeated thing in him, partly the gambling\nspirit which seizes men when nothing is left but one great spectacular\nsuccess or else be blotted out.  That’s the case with your philosopher;\nand I’m not sure that I won’t lose twenty thousand dollars by him yet.”",
        "“You’ve lost more with less justification,” retorted the Judge, who, in\nhis ninetieth year, was still as alive as his friend at sixty.",
        "M. Mornay waved a hand in acknowledgment, and rolled his cigar from\ncorner to corner of his mouth.  “Oh, I’ve lost a lot more in my time,\nJudge, but with a squint in my eye!  But I’m doing this with no\nastigmatism.  I’ve got the focus.”",
        "The aged Judge gave a conciliatory murmur-he had a fine persuasive voice.\n“You would never be sorry for what you have done if you had known his\ndaughter–his Zoe.  It’s the thought of her that keeps him going.  He\nwants the place to be just as she left it when she comes back.”",
        "“Well, well, let’s hope it will.  I’m giving him a chance,” replied M.\nMornay with his wineglass raised.  “He’s got eight thousand dollars in\ncash to build his mill again; and I hope he’ll keep a tight hand on it\ntill the mill is up.”",
        "Keep a tight hand on it?",
        "That is what Jean Jacques meant to do; but if a man wants to keep a tight\nhand on money he should not carry it about in his pocket in cold, hard\ncash.  It was a foolish whim of Jean Jacques that he must have the eight\nthousand dollars in cash–in hundred-dollar bills–and not in the form of\na cheque; but there was something childlike in him.  When, as he thought,\nhe had saved himself from complete ruin, he wanted to keep and gloat over\nthe trophy of victory, and his trophy was the eight thousand dollars got\nfrom the Barbille farm.  He would have to pay out two thousand dollars in\ncash to the contractors for the rebuilding of the mill at once,–they\nwere more than usually cautious–but he would have six thousand left,\nwhich he would put in the bank after he had let people see that he was\nwell fortified with cash.",
        "The child in him liked the idea of pulling out of his pocket a few\nthousand dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  He had always carried a good\ndeal of money loose in his pocket, and now that his resources were so\nlimited he would still make a gallant show.  After a week or two he would\ndeposit six thousand dollars in the bank; but he was so eager to begin\nbuilding the mill, that he paid over the stipulated two thousand dollars\nto the contractors on the very day he received the eight thousand.  A few\ndays later the remaining six thousand were housed in a cupboard with an\niron door in the wall of his office at the Manor Cartier.",
        "“There, that will keep me in heart and promise,” said Jean Jacques as he\nturned the key in the lock.",
