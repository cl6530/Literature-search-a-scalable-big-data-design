        "THE STORY OF THE MYSTERIOUS MOSCOVITE\nEMPIRE WHICH SUDDENLY BURST UPON\nTHE GRAND POLITICAL STAGE OF EUROPE",
        "IN the year 1492, as you know, Columbus discovered America.\nEarly in the year, a Tyrolese by the name of Schnups,\ntravelling as the head of a scientific expedition for the\nArchbishop of Tyrol, and provided with the best letters\nof introduction and excellent credit tried to reach the mythical\ntown of Moscow. He did not succeed. When he reached the\nfrontiers of this vast Moscovite state which was vaguely supposed\nto exist in the extreme Eastern part of Europe, he was\nfirmly turned back. No foreigners were wanted. And\nSchnups went to visit the heathen Turk in Constantinople, in\norder that he might have something to report to his clerical\nmaster when he came back from his explorations.",
        "Sixty-one years later, Richard Chancellor, trying to discover\nthe North-eastern passage to the Indies, and blown by\nan ill wind into the White Sea, reached the mouth of the Dwina\nand found the Moscovite village of Kholmogory, a few hours\nfrom the spot where in 1584 the town of Archangel was founded.\nThis time the foreign visitors were requested to come\nto Moscow and show themselves to the Grand Duke. They\nwent and returned to England with the first commercial treaty\never concluded between Russia and the western world. Other\nnations soon followed and something became known of this\nmysterious land.",
        "Geographically, Russia is a vast plain. The Ural mountains\nare low and form no barrier against invaders. The\nrivers are broad but often shallow. It was an ideal territory for\nnomads.",
        "While the Roman Empire was founded, grew in power and\ndisappeared again, Slavic tribes, who had long since left their\nhomes in Central Asia, wandered aimlessly through the forests\nand plains of the region between the Dniester and Dnieper\nrivers. The Greeks had sometimes met these Slavs and a few\ntravellers of the third and fourth centuries mention them.\nOtherwise they were as little known as were the Nevada Indians\nin the year 1800.",
        "Unfortunately for the peace of these primitive peoples, a\nvery convenient trade-route ran through their country. This\nwas the main road from northern Europe to Constantinople.\nIt followed the coast of the Baltic until the Neva was reached.\nThen it crossed Lake Ladoga and went southward along the\nVolkhov river. Then through Lake Ilmen and up the small\nLovat river. Then there was a short portage until the Dnieper\nwas reached. Then down the Dnieper into the Black Sea.",
        "The Norsemen knew of this road at a very early date. In\nthe ninth century they began to settle in northern Russia, just\nas other Norsemen were laying the foundation for independent\nstates in Germany and France. But in the year 862, three\nNorsemen, brothers, crossed the Baltic and founded three small\ndynasties. Of the three brothers, only one, Rurik, lived for a\nnumber of years. He took possession of the territory of his\nbrothers, and twenty years after the arrival of this first\nNorseman, a Slavic state had been established with Kiev as its\ncapital.",
        "From Kiev to the Black Sea is a short distance. Soon the\nexistence of an organised Slavic State became known in\nConstantinople. This meant a new field for the zealous\nmissionaries of the Christian faith. Byzantine monks followed the\nDnieper on their way northward and soon reached the heart of\nRussia. They found the people worshipping strange gods\nwho were supposed to dwell in woods and rivers and in mountain\ncaves. They taught them the story of Jesus. There was\nno competition from the side of Roman missionaries. These\ngood men were too busy educating the heathen Teutons to\nbother about the distant Slavs. Hence Russia received its religion\nand its alphabet and its first ideas of art and architecture\nfrom the Byzantine monks and as the Byzantine empire (a\nrelic of the eastern Roman empire) had become very oriental\nand had lost many of its European traits, the Russians suffered\nin consequence.",
        "Politically speaking these new states of the great Russian\nplains did not fare well. It was the Norse habit to divide\nevery inheritance equally among all the sons. No sooner had\na small state been founded but it was broken up among eight\nor nine heirs who in turn left their territory to an ever increasing\nnumber of descendants. It was inevitable that these small\ncompeting states should quarrel among themselves. Anarchy\nwas the order of the day. And when the red glow of the eastern\nhorizon told the people of the threatened invasion of a savage\nAsiatic tribe, the little states were too weak and too divided\nto render any sort of defence against this terrible enemy.",
        "It was in the year 1224 that the first great Tartar invasion\ntook place and that the hordes of Jenghiz Khan, the conqueror\nof China, Bokhara, Tashkent and Turkestan made their first\nappearance in the west. The Slavic armies were beaten near\nthe Kalka river and Russia was at the mercy of the Mongolians.\nJust as suddenly as they had come they disappeared.\nThirteen years later, in 1237, however, they returned. In less\nthan five years they conquered every part of the vast Russian\nplains. Until the year 1380 when Dmitry Donskoi, Grand\nDuke of Moscow, beat them on the plains of Kulikovo, the\nTartars were the masters of the Russian people.",
        "All in all, it took the Russians two centuries to deliver\nthemselves from this yoke. For a yoke it was and a most\noffensive and objectionable one. It turned the Slavic peasants\ninto miserable slaves. No Russian could hope to survive un-\nless he was willing to creep before a dirty little yellow man who\nsat in a tent somewhere in the heart of the steppes of southern\nRussia and spat at him. It deprived the mass of the people of\nall feeling of honour and independence. It made hunger and\nmisery and maltreatment and personal abuse the normal state\nof human existence. Until at last the average Russian, were he\npeasant or nobleman, went about his business like a neglected\ndog who has been beaten so often that his spirit has been broken\nand he dare not wag his tail without permission.",
        "There was no escape. The horsemen of the Tartar Khan\nwere fast and merciless. The endless prairie did not give a\nman a chance to cross into the safe territory of his neighbour.\nHe must keep quiet and bear what his yellow master decided\nto inflict upon him or run the risk of death. Of course, Europe\nmight have interfered. But Europe was engaged upon business\nof its own, fighting the quarrels between the Pope and\nthe emperor or suppressing this or that or the other heresy.\nAnd so Europe left the Slav to his fate, and forced him to\nwork out his own salvation.",
        "The final saviour of Russia was one of the many small states,\nfounded by the early Norse rulers. It was situated in the heart\nof the Russian plain. Its capital, Moscow, was upon a steep\nhill on the banks of the Moskwa river. This little principality,\nby dint of pleasing the Tartar (when it was necessary to\nplease), and opposing him (when it was safe to do so), had,\nduring the middle of the fourteenth century made itself the\nleader of a new national life. It must be remembered that the\nTartars were wholly deficient in constructive political ability.\nThey could only destroy. Their chief aim in conquering new\nterritories was to obtain revenue. To get this revenue in the\nform of taxes, it was necessary to allow certain remnants of\nthe old political organization to continue. Hence there were\nmany little towns, surviving by the grace of the Great Khan,\nthat they might act as tax-gatherers and rob their neighbours\nfor the benefit of the Tartar treasury.",
        "The state of Moscow, growing fat at the expense of the\nsurrounding territory, finally became strong enough to risk\nopen rebellion against its masters, the Tartars. It was successful\nand its fame as the leader in the cause of Russian independence\nmade Moscow the natural centre for all those who\nstill believed in a better future for the Slavic race. In the year\n1458, Constantinople was taken by the Turks. Ten years\nlater, under the rule of Ivan III, Moscow informed the\nwestern world that the Slavic state laid claim to the worldly\nand spiritual inheritance of the lost Byzantine Empire, and\nsuch traditions of the Roman empire as had survived in\nConstantinople. A generation afterwards, under Ivan the Terrible,\nthe grand dukes of Moscow were strong enough to adopt the\ntitle of Caesar, or Tsar, and to demand recognition by the western\npowers of Europe.",
        "In the year 1598, with Feodor the First, the old Muscovite\ndynasty, descendants of the original Norseman Rurik, came to\nan end. For the next seven years, a Tartar half-breed, by the\nname of Boris Godunow, reigned as Tsar. It was during\nthis period that the future destiny of the large masses of the\nRussian people was decided. This Empire was rich in land\nbut very poor in money. There was no trade and there were\nno factories. Its few cities were dirty villages. It was composed\nof a strong central government and a vast number of\nilliterate peasants. This government, a mixture of Slavic,\nNorse, Byzantine and Tartar influences, recognised nothing\nbeyond the interest of the state. To defend this state, it\nneeded an army. To gather the taxes, which were necessary\nto pay the soldiers, it needed civil servants. To pay these many\nofficials it needed land. In the vast wilderness on the east\nand west there was a sufficient supply of this commodity. But\nland without a few labourers to till the fields and tend the\ncattle, has no value. Therefore the old nomadic peasants\nwere robbed of one privilege after the other, until finally, during\nthe first year of the sixteenth century, they were formally\nmade a part of the soil upon which they lived. The Russian\npeasants ceased to be free men. They became serfs or slaves\nand they remained serfs until the year 1861, when their fate\nhad become so terrible that they were beginning to die out.",
        "In the seventeenth century, this new state with its growing\nterritory which was spreading quickly into Siberia, had become\na force with which the rest of Europe was obliged to\nreckon. In 1618, after the death of Boris Godunow, the\nRussian nobles had elected one of their own number to be\nTsar. He was Michael, the son of Feodor, of the Moscow family\nof Romanow who lived in a little house just outside the\nKremlin.",
        "In the year 1672 his great-grandson, Peter, the son of another\nFeodor, was born. When the child was ten years old,\nhis step-sister Sophia took possession of the Russian throne.\nThe little boy was allowed to spend his days in the suburbs of\nthe national capital, where the foreigners lived. Surrounded\nby Scotch barkeepers, Dutch traders, Swiss apothecaries, Italian\nbarbers, French dancing teachers and German school-masters,\nthe young prince obtained a first but rather extraordinary\nimpression of that far-away and mysterious Europe where\nthings were done differently.",
        "When he was seventeen years old, he suddenly pushed\nSister Sophia from the throne. Peter himself became the ruler\nof Russia. He was not contented with being the Tsar of a\nsemi-barbarous and half-Asiatic people. He must be the sovereign\nhead of a civilised nation. To change Russia overnight\nfrom a Byzantine-Tartar state into a European empire was no\nsmall undertaking. It needed strong hands and a capable\nhead. Peter possessed both. In the year 1698, the great\noperation of grafting Modern Europe upon Ancient Russia was\nperformed. The patient did not die. But he never got over\nthe shock, as the events of the last five years have shown very\nplainly.",
