        "More hopeful than all wisdom is one draught of human pity that will not\nforsake us.",
        "Laughing is one of the products of civilization.  In the uncivilized\ntribes laughter is entirely unknown.",
        "Let him who neglects to raise the fallen fear lest, when he falls, no\none will stretch out his hand to lift him up.",
        "Time is a species of wealth which it is impossible for us to hoard, but\nwhich we may spend to good advantage.",
        "Character is the eternal temple that each one begins to rear, yet death\ncan only complete it.  The finer the architecture, the more fit for the\nindwelling of angels.",
        "It is only by labor that thought can be made healthy, and only by\nthought that labor can be made happy; and the two can not be separated\nwith impunity.–John Ruskin.",
        "Don’t moralize to a man who is on his back.  Help him up, set him\nfirmly on his feet, and then give him advice and means.",
        "There is a pleasure in contemplating good; there is a greater pleasure\nin receiving good; but the greatest pleasure of all is in doing good,\nwhich comprehends the rest.",
        "Morality without religion is only a kind of dead reckoning–an endeavor\nto navigate a cloudy sea by measuring the distance we have to run, but\nwithout observation of the heavenly bodies.",
        "Most people keep too strong a hold of their personality to be able to\nforget themselves in their subject; they carry an unacknowledged\nself-consciousness along with them.  If to be single-minded is to have\nan undivided interest in things, they are not single-minded.",
        "Real affection is independent.  A woman may passionately love a man who\ndoes not care for her, and men have gone mad for the sake of women who\nwere indifferent to them.  That affection which survives coldness or\neven contempt on the part of the subject is a stronger proof of its\nstrength than jealousy, however well founded.",
        "To have a respect for ourselves guides our morals, and to have a\ndeference for others governs our manners.",
        "If you want to be miserable, think about yourself, about what you want,\nwhat you like, what respect people pay you, and what people think of\nyou.",
        "One great impediment to the rapid dissemination of new truths is that a\nknowledge of them would convict many sage professors of having long\npromulgated error.",
        "The leaves that give out the sweetest fragrance are those that are the\nmost cruelly crushed; so the hearts of those who have suffered most can\nfeel for others’ woes.",
        "Each of us can so believe in humanity in general as to contribute to\nthat pressure which constantly levers up the race; can surround\nourselves with an atmosphere optimistic rather than the\ncontrary.–Selected.",
        "He who has more knowledge than good works is like a tree with many\nbranches and few roots, which the first wind throws on its face; while\nhe who does more than he says is like a tree with strong roots and few\nbranches, which all the winds can not uproot.–Talmud.",
        "If we waited until it was perfectly convenient, half of the good\nactions of life would never be accomplished, and very few of its\nsuccesses.",
        "A helping word to one in trouble is often like a switch on a railroad\ntrack, but one inch between wreck and smooth rolling prosperity.",
        "Prayer is the key of day and lock of the night; and we should every day\nbegin and end, bid ourselves good morrow and good night, with prayer.",
        "In order to love mankind, expect but little from them; in order to view\ntheir faults without bitterness, pardon them.  The wisest men have\nalways been the most indulgent.",
        "There are souls which fall from heaven like flowers, but ere the pure\nand fresh buds can open they are trodden in the dust of the earth, and\nlie soiled and crushed under the foul tread of some brutal hoof.",
        "Many of the men we calmly set down as failures may have been doing as\nmuch as those who have made ten times as much noise in the world.  A\ngreat deal of the best work in the world is anonymous, if we do not\nconfine the term to writing.",
        "To a man of brave sentiments midnight is as bright as noonday, for the\nillumination is within.",
        "That man who lives in vain lives worse than vain.  He who lives to no\npurpose lives to a bad purpose.–Nevins.",
        "Labor is the law of the world, and he who lives by other men’s means is\nof less value to the world than the buzzing, busy insect.",
        "Deep is the sea, and deep is hell, but pride runneth deeper; it is\ncoiled as a poisonous worm about the foundation of the soul.–Tupper.",
        "The integrity of the heart, when it is strengthened by reason, is the\nprincipal source of justice and wit; an honest man thinks nearly always\njustly.",
        "Be firm, but be not too hasty to decide; weigh well before you act,\nbut, having weighed, act promptly, and abide the result.  This is the\ntest of judgment.",
        "Wit loses its respect with the good when seen in company with malice;\nand to smile at the jest which plants a thorn in another’s breast is to\nbecome a principal in the mischief.",
        "Success never did, never will come to that young man who knows\neverything–in his own opinion.",
        "In love, as in everything else, truth is the strongest of all things,\nand frankness is but another name for truth.",
        "Frequent disappointment teaches us to mistrust our own inclination, and\nshrink even from vows our hearts may prompt.",
        "For children there is no leave-taking, for they acknowledge no past,\nonly the present, that to them is full of the future.",
        "To love, in order to be loved in return, is man, but to love for the\npure sake of loving, is almost the characteristic of an angel.",
        "Fond as a man is of sight-seeing, life is the great show for every\nman–the show always wonderful and new to the thoughtful.",
        "The sweetest book in all the world, if properly read, is the Bible.\nIts leaves are as fragrant as a bed of violets in full bloom.",
        "Pity gilds mortality with rays of immortal light, and through faith\nenables its possessor to triumph over sin, sorrow, tribulation and\ndeath.",
        "If we can not live so as to be happy, let us at least live so as to\ndeserve happiness.–Fichte.",
        "Little by little fortunes are accumulated; little by little knowledge\nis gained; little by little character and reputation are achieved.",
        "Don’t rely for success upon empty praise.  The swimmer upon the stream\nof life must be able to keep afloat without the aid of bladders.",
        "Industry–In seeking a situation, remember that the right kind of men\nare always in demand, and that industry and capacity rarely go\nempty-handed.",
        "Frankness is the child of honesty and courage.  Say just what you mean\nto do on every occasion, and take it for granted that you mean to do\nwhat is right.",
        "To be always intending to lead a new life, but never to find time to\nset about it, is as if a man should put off eating from one day to\nanother till he is starved.",
        "A man loved by a beautiful and virtuous woman carries a talisman that\nrenders him invulnerable; every one feels that such a one’s life has a\nhigher value than that of others.",
        "The great beauty of charity is privacy; there is a sweet force, even in\nan anonymous penny.",
        "Every heart has its secret sorrows, and oftentimes we call a man cold\nwhen he was only sad.",
        "A promise should be given with caution, and kept with care; it should\nbe made with the heart and kept with the head.",
        "“The mind of a young creature,” says Berkely, “can not remain empty; if\nyou do not put into it that which is good, it will be sure to use even\nthat which is bad.”",
        "We all see at sunset the beautiful colors streaming all over the\nwestern sky, but no eyes can behold the hand that overturns the urns\nwhence these streams are poured.",
        "We often live under a cloud, and it is well for us that we should do\nso.  Uninterrupted sunshine would parch our hearts.  We want shade and\nrain to cool and refresh them.",
        "Poverty is very terrible to you, and kills the soul in you sometimes;\nbut it is the north wind that lashed men into vikings; it is the soft,\nluscious south wind that lulls to lotus dreams.",
        "There is nothing so valuable, and yet so cheap, as civility; you can\nalmost buy land with it.",
        "It has been justly said nothing in man is so Godlike as doing good to\nour fellows.–Selected.",
        "Contentment swells a mite into a talent, and makes even the poor richer\nthan the Indies.–Addison.",
        "Never was a sincere word utterly lost, never a magnanimity fell to the\nground; there is some heart always to greet and accept it unexpectedly.",
        "There are people who often talk of the humbleness of their origin, when\nthey are really ashamed of it, though vain of the talent which enabled\nthem to emerge from it.",
        "A witty old deacon put it thus: “Now, brethren, let us get up a supper\nand eat ourselves rich.  Buy your food, then give it to the church;\nthen go and buy it back again; then eat it up, and your church debt is\npaid.”",
        "Self-sacrifice is the essential mark of the Christian, and the absence\nof it is sufficient at once to condemn the man who calls himself by\nthat name and yet has it not, and to declare that he has no right to\nit.–Bolton.",
        "There are many comfortable people in the world, but to call any man\nperfectly happy is an insult.",
        "Women often make light of ruin.  Give them but the beloved objects, and\npoverty is but a trifling sorrow to bear.–Thackeray,",
        "Independence is a name for what no man possesses; nothing in the\nanimate or inanimate world is more dependent than man.",
        "Wealth is to be used only as an instrument of action, not as the\nrepresentative of civil honors and moral excellence.–Jane Porter.",
        "There is nothing purer, nothing warmer than our first friendship, our\nfirst love, our first striving after truth, our first feeling for\nnature.–Jean Paul Richter.",
        "Shakespeare is as much out of the category of eminent authors as he is\nout of the crowd.  He is inconceivably wise; the others\nconceivably.–Representative Men.",
        "A smooth sea never made a skillful mariner.  Neither do uninterrupted\nprosperity and success qualify a man for usefulness and happiness.  The\nstorms of adversity, like the storms of the ocean, arouse the faculties\nand excite the invention, prudence, skill and fortitude of the voyager.",
        "It is not work that hurts men.  It is the corrosion of uncertainty; it\nis the anticipation of trouble; it is living in a state of painful\napprehension.  Therefore we should endeavor to rise out of the\natmosphere of gloomy forebodings.  The man who is lifted above fear and\nits whole brood of mischief can go through twice as much trouble as a\nman who is subject to its influence.",
        "He that looks out upon life from a sour or severe disposition, with\nhard and stringent notions, is ill prepared to meet the experiences of\nthe world; but he who has the sweetness of hope, he who has an\nimagination lit up with cheerfulness, he who has the sense of humor\nwhich softens all things–he who has this atmosphere of the mind–has\nmade himself superior to accident.  As the angel described by Milton,\nwho was smitten by the sword, and whose wounds healed as soon as the\nsword was withdrawn, so ought man to be; and when he receives a spear\nthrust in life, no sooner should the spear be withdrawn than his flesh\nought to “close and be itself again.”",
        "A married man falling into misfortune is more apt to retrieve his\nsituation in the world than a single one, chiefly because his spirits\nare soothed and retrieved by domestic endearments, and his self-respect\nkept alive by finding that, although all abroad is darkness and\nhumiliation, yet there is a little world of love at home over which he\nis monarch.",
