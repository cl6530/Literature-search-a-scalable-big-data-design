        "It has never been my practice to introduce myself to distinguished\npersons, or to attempt in any way to attract their attention, and I now\nregret that I did not embrace some opportunities which occurred to me in\nearly life for doing so; but at the time I knew the men whom I have\ndescribed in the present volume I had no expectation that I should ever\nwrite about them. My acquaintance with them, however, has served to give\nme a more elevated idea of human nature than I otherwise might have\nacquired in the ordinary course of mundane affairs, and it is with the\nhope of transmitting this impression to my readers that I publish the\npresent account. Some of them have a world-wide celebrity, and others who\nwere distinguished in their own time seem likely now to be forgotten; but\nthey all deserve well of the republic of humanity and of the age in which\nthey lived.",
        "THE EVERGREENS, JANUARY 4, 1905.",
        "One bright morning in April, 1865, Hawthorne’s son and the writer were\ncoming forth together from the further door-way of Stoughton Hall at\nHarvard College, when, as the last reverberations of the prayer-bell were\nsounding, a classmate called to us across the yard: “General Lee has\nsurrendered!” There was a busy hum of voices where the three converging\nlines of students met in front of Appleton Chapel, and when we entered\nthe building there was President Hill seated in the recess between the\ntwo pulpits, and old Doctor Peabody at his desk, with his face beaming\nlike that of a saint in an old religious painting. His prayer was\nexceptionally fervid and serious. He asked a blessing on the American\npeople; on all those who had suffered from the war; on the government of\nthe United States; and on our defeated enemies. When the short service\nhad ended, Doctor Hill came forward and said: “It is not fitting that any\ncollege tasks or exercises should take place until another sun has arisen\nafter this glorious morning. Let us all celebrate this fortunate event.”",
        "On leaving the chapel we found that Flavius Josephus Cook, afterwards\nRev. Joseph Cook of the Monday Lectureship, had collected the members of\nthe Christian Brethren about him, and they were all singing a hymn of\nthanksgiving in a very vigorous manner.",
        "There were some, however, who recollected on their way to breakfast the\nsad procession that had passed through the college-yard six months\nbefore,—the military funeral of James Russell Lowell’s nephews, killed\nin General Sheridan’s victory at Cedar Run. There were no recent\ngraduates of Harvard more universally beloved than Charles and James\nLowell; and none of whom better things were expected. To Lowell himself,\nwho had no other children, except a daughter, they were almost like his\nown sons, and the ode he wrote on this occasion touches a depth of pathos\nnot to be met with elsewhere in his poetry. There was not at that time\nanother family in Cambridge or Boston which contained two such bright\nintellects, two such fine characters. It did not seem right that they\nshould both have left their mother, who was bereaved already by a\nfaithless husband, to fight the battles of their country, however much\nthey were needed for this. Even in the most despotic period of European\nhistory the only son of a widow was exempt from conscription. Then to\nlose them both in a single day! Mrs. Lowell became the saint of Quincy\nStreet, and none were so hardened or self-absorbed as not to do her\nreverence.",
        "But now the terrible past was eclipsed by the joy and pride of victory.\nThe great heroic struggle was over; young men could look forward to the\npractice of peaceable professions, and old men had no longer to think of\nthe exhausting drain upon their resources. Fond mothers could now count\nupon the survival of their sons, and young wives no longer feared to\nbecome widows in a night. Everywhere there was joy and exhilaration. To\nmany it was the happiest day they had ever known.",
        "President Hill was seen holding a long and earnest conversation with\nAgassiz on the path towards his house. The professors threw aside their\ncontemplated work. Every man went to drink a glass of wine with his best\nfriend, and to discuss the fortunes of the republic. The ball-players set\noff for the Delta, where Memorial Hall now stands, to organize a full\nmatch game; the billiard experts started a tournament on Mr. Lyon’s new\ntables; and the rowing men set off for a three-hours’ pull down Boston\nharbor. Others collected in groups and discussed the future of their\ncountry with the natural precocity of youthful minds. “Here,” said a\nBoston cousin of the two young Lowells, to a pink-faced, sandy-haired\nball-player, “you are opposed to capital punishment; do you think Jeff.\nDavis ought to be hung?” “Just at present,” replied the latter, “I am\nmore in favor of suspending Jeff. Davis than of suspending the law,\"—an\nopinion that was greeted with laughter and applause. The general\nsentiment of the crowd was in favor of permitting General Lee to retire\nin peace to private life; but in regard to the president of the Southern\nConfederacy the feeling was more vindictive.",
        "We can now consider it fortunate that no such retaliatory measures were\ntaken by the government. Much better that Jefferson Davis, and his\nconfederates in the secession movement, should have lived to witness\nevery day the consequences of that gigantic blunder. The fact that they\nadopted a name for their newly-organized nation which did not differ\nessentially from the one which they had discarded; that their form of\ngovernment, with its constitution and laws, differed so slightly from\nthose of the United States, is sufficient to indicate that their\nseparation was not to be permanent, and that it only required the\nabolition of slavery to bring the Southern States back to their former\nposition in the Union. If men and nations did what was for their true\ninterests, this would be a different world.",
        "At that time the college proper consisted of three recitation buildings,\nand four or five dormitories, besides Appleton Chapel, and little old\nHolden Chapel of the seventeenth century, which still remains the best\narchitecture on the grounds. The buildings were mostly old, plain, and\nhomely, and the rooms of the students simply furnished. In every class\nthere were twelve or fifteen dandies, who dressed in somewhat above the\nheight of the fashion, but they served to make the place more picturesque\nand were not so likely to be mischievous as some of the rougher country\nboys. It was a time of plain, sensible living. To hire a man to make\nfires in winter, and black the boots, was considered a great luxury. A\nmajority of the students blacked their own boots, although they found\nthis very disagreeable. The college pump was a venerable institution, a\nleveller of all distinctions; and many a pleasant conversation took place\nabout its wooden trough. No student thought of owning an equipage, and a\nRussell or a Longworth would as soon have hired a sedan chair as a horse\nand buggy, when he might have gone on foot. Good pedestrianism was the\npride of the Harvard student; and an honest, wholesome pride it was.\nThere was also some good running. Both Julian Hawthorne and Thomas W.\nWard ran to Concord, a distance of sixteen miles, without stopping, I\nbelieve, by the way. William Blaikie, the stroke of the University crew,\nwalked to New York during the Thanksgiving recess—six days in all.",
        "The undergraduates had not yet become acquainted with tennis, the most\ndelightful of light exercises, and foot-ball had not yet been regulated\naccording to the rules of Rugby and Harrow. The last of the pernicious\nfoot-ball fights between Sophomores and Freshmen took place in September,\n1863, and commenced in quite a sanguinary manner. A Sophomore named\nWright knocked over Ellis, the captain of the Freshman side, without\nreason or provocation, and was himself immediately laid prostrate by a\nred-headed Scotch boy named Roderick Dhu Coe, who seemed to have come to\ncollege for the purpose, for he soon afterwards disappeared and was never\nseen there again. With the help of Coe and a few similar spirits, the\nFreshmen won the game. It was the first of President Hill’s reforms to\nabolish this brutal and unseemly custom.",
        "The New York game of base-ball, which has since assumed such mammoth\nproportions, was first introduced in our colleges by Wright and Flagg, of\nthe Class of ’66; and the first game, which the Cambridge ladies\nattended, was played on the Delta in May of that year with the\nTrimountain Club of Boston. Flagg was the finest catcher in New England\nat that time; and, although he was never chosen captain, he was the most\nskillful manager of the game. It was he who invented the double-play\nwhich can sometimes be accomplished by muffing a fly-catch between the\nbases. He caught without mask or gloves and was several times wounded by\nthe ball.",
        "Let us retrace the steps of time and take a look at the old Delta on a\nbright June evening, when the shadows of the elms are lengthening across\nthe grass. There are from fifty to a hundred students, and perhaps three\nor four professors, watching the Harvard nine practise in preparation for\nits match with the formidable Lowell nine of Boston. Who is that slender\nyouth at second base,—with the long nose and good-humored twinkle in his\neye,—who never allows a ball to pass by him? Will he ever become the\nDean of the Harvard Law School? And that tall, olive-complexioned fellow\nin the outfield, six feet two in his ball-shoes,—who would suppose that\nhe is destined to go to Congress and serve his country as Minister to\nSpain! There is another dark-eyed youth leaning against the fence and\nwatching the ball as it passes to and fro. Is he destined to become\nGovernor of Massachusetts? And that sturdy-looking first-baseman,—will\nhe enter the ministry and preach sermons in Appleton Chapel? These young\nmen all live quiet, sensible lives, and trouble themselves little\nconcerning class honors and secret societies. If they have a\ncharacteristic in common it is that they always keep their mental balance\nand never go to extremes; but neither they nor others have any suspicion\nof their several destinies. Could they return and fill their former\nplaces on the ground, how strangely they would feel! But the ground\nitself is gone; their youth is gone, and the honors that have come to\nthem seem less important than the welfare of their families and kindred.",
        "Misdemeanors, great and small, on the part of the students were more\ncommon formerly than they have been in recent years, for the good reason\nthat the chances of detection were very much less. Some of the practical\njokes were of a much too serious character. The college Bible was\nabstracted from the Chapel and sent to Yale; the communion wine was\nstolen; a paper bombshell was exploded behind a curtain in the Greek\nrecitation-room; and Professor Pierce discovered one morning that all his\nblack-boards had been painted white. All the copies of Cooke’s Chemical\nPhysics suddenly disappeared one afternoon, and next morning the best\nscholars in the Junior Class were obliged to say, “Not prepared.”",
        "A society called the Med. Fac. was chiefly responsible for these\nperformances; but so secret was it in its membership and proceedings that\nneither the college faculty nor the great majority of the students really\nknew whether there was such a society in existence or not. A judge of the\nUnited States Circuit Court, who had belonged to it in his time, was not\naware that his own son was a member of it.",
        "Some of the members of this society turned out well, and others badly;\nbut generally an inclination for such high pranks shows a levity of\nnature that bodes ill for the future. A college class is a wonderful\nstudy in human nature, from the time it enters until its members have\narrived at forty or fifty years of age. There was one young man at\nHarvard in those days who was so evidently marked out by destiny for a\ngreat public career that when he was elected to Congress in 1876 his\nclassmates were only surprised because it seemed so natural that this\nshould happen. Another was of so depraved a character that it seemed as\nif he was intended to illustrate the bad boy in a Sunday-school book. He\nwas so untrustworthy that very soon no one was willing to associate with\nhim. He stole from his father, and, after graduating, went to prison for\nforgery and finally was killed by a tornado. There was still another, a\ngreat fat fellow, who always seemed to be half asleep, and was very\nshortly run over and killed by a locomotive. Yet if we could know the\nwhole truth in regard to these persons it might be difficult to decide\nhow much of their good and evil fortune was owing to themselves and how\nmuch to hereditary tendencies and early influences. The sad fact remains\nthat it is much easier to spoil a bright boy than to educate a dull one.",
        "The undergraduates were too much absorbed in their own small affairs to\npay much attention to politics, even in those exciting times. For the\nmost part there was no discrimination against either the Trojans or\nTyrians; but abolitionists were not quite so well liked as others,\nespecially after the close of the war; and it was noticed that the sons\nof pro-slavery families commonly seemed to have lacked the good moral\ntraining (and the respect for industry) which is youth’s surest\nprotection against the pitfalls of life. The larger proportion of\nsuspended students belonged to this class.",
        "During the war period Cambridge social life was regulated by a coterie of\nten or twelve young ladies who had grown up together and who were\ngenerally known as the “Spree,\"—not because they were given to romping,\nfor none kept more strictly within the bounds of a decorous propriety,\nbut because they were accustomed to go off together in the summer to the\nWhite Mountains or to some other rustic resort, where they were supposed\nto have a perfectly splendid time; and this they probably did, for it\nrequires cultivation and refinement of feeling to appreciate nature as\nwell as art. They decided what students and other young ladies should be\ninvited to the assemblies in Lyceum Hall, and they arranged their own\nprivate entertainments over the heads of their fathers and mothers; and\nit should be added that they exercised their authority with a very good\ngrace. They had their friends and admirers among the collegians, but no\nyoung man of good manners and pleasing address, and above all who was a\ngood dancer, needed to beg for an invitation. The good dancers, however,\nwere in a decided minority, and many who considered themselves so in\ntheir own habitats found themselves much below the standard in Cambridge.",
        "Mrs. James Russell Lowell was one of the lady patronesses of the\nassemblies, and her husband sometimes came to them for an hour or so\nbefore escorting her home. He watched the performance with a poet’s eye\nfor whatever is graceful and charming, but sometimes also with a humorous\nsmile playing upon his face. There were some very good dancers among the\nladies who skimmed the floor almost like swallows; but the finest waltzer\nin Cambridge or Boston was Theodore Colburn, who had graduated ten years\npreviously, and with the advantage of a youthful figure, had kept up the\npastime ever since. The present writer has never seen anywhere another\nman who could waltz with such consummate ease and unconscious grace.\nLowell’s eyes followed him continually; but it is also said that Colburn\nwould willingly dispense with the talent for better success in his\nprofession. Next to him comes the tall ball-player, already referred to,\nand it is delightful to see the skill with which he adapts his unusual\nheight to the most petite damsel on the floor. Here the “Spree” is\nomnipotent, but it does not like Class Day, for then Boston and its\nsuburbs pour forth their torrent of beauty and fashion, and Cambridge for\nthe time being is left somewhat in the shade.",
        "Henry James in his “International Episode” speaks as if New York dancers\nwere the best in the world, and they are certainly more light-footed than\nEnglish men and women; but a New York lady, with whom Mr. James is well\nacquainted, says that Bostonians and Austrians are the finest dancers.\nThe true Bostonian cultivates a sober reserve in his waltzing which, if\nnot too serious, adds to the grace of his movement. Yet, when the german\nis over, we remember the warning of the wealthy Corinthian who refused\nhis daughter to the son of Tisander on the ground that he was too much of\na dancer and acrobat.",
        "From 1840 to 1860 Harvard University practically stagnated. The world\nabout it progressed, but the college remained unchanged. Its presidents\nwere excellent men, but they had lived too long under the academic shade.\nThey lacked practical experience in the great world. There were few\nlectures in the college course, and the recitations were a mere routine.\nThe text-books on philosophical subjects were narrow and prejudiced.\nModern languages were sadly neglected; and the tradition that a French\ninstructor once entertained his class by telling them his dreams, if not\ntrue, was at least characteristic. The sons of wealthy Bostonians were\naccustomed to brag that they had gone through college without doing any\nreal studying. To the college faculty politics only meant the success of\nWebster and the great Whig party. The anti-slavery agitation was\nconsidered inconvenient and therefore prejudicial. During the struggle\nfor free institutions in Kansas, the president of Harvard College\nundertook to debate the question in a public meeting, but he displayed\nsuch lamentable ignorance that he was soon obliged to retire in\nconfusion.",
        "The war for the Union, however, waked up the slumbering university, as it\ndid all other institutions and persons. Rev. Thomas Hill was chosen\npresident in 1861, and was the first anti-slavery president of the\ncollege since Josiah Quincy; and this of itself indicated that he was in\naccord with the times,—had not set his face obstinately against them. He\nwas not so practical a man as President Quincy, but he was one of the\nbest scholars in America. His administration has not been looked upon as\na success, but he served to break the ice and to open the way for future\nnavigation. He accepted the position with definite ideas of reform; but\nhe lacked skill in the adaptation of means to ends. He was determined to\nshow no favoritism to wealth and social position, and he went perhaps too\nfar in the opposite direction. One day when the workmen were digging the\ncellar of Gray’s Hall, President Hill threw off his coat, seized a\nshovel, and used it vigorously for half an hour or more. This was\nintended as an example to teach the students the dignity of labor; but\nthey did not understand it so. At the faculty meetings he carried\ninformality of manner to an excess. He depended too much on personal\ninfluence, which, as George Washington said formerly, “cannot become\ngovernment.” He wrote letters to the Sophomores exhorting them not to\nhaze the Freshmen, and, as a consequence, the Freshmen were hazed more\nseverely than ever. Then he suspended the Sophomores in a wholesale\nmanner, many of them for slight offences. However, he stopped the foot-\nball fights, and made the examinations much more strict than they had\nbeen previously. He endeavored to inculcate the true spirit of\nscholarship among the students,—not to study for rank but from a genuine\nlove of the subject. The opposition that his reforms excited made him\nunpopular, and Freshmen came to college so prejudiced against him that\nall his kindness and good will were wasted upon them.",
        "“There goes the greatest man in this country,” said a fashionable Boston\nyouth, one day in the spring of 1866. It was Louis Agassiz returning from\na call on President Hill. Such a statement shows that the speaker\nbelonged to a class of people called Tories, in 1776, and who might\nproperly be called so still. As a matter of fact, Agassiz had long since\npassed the meridian of his reputation, and his sun was now not far from\nsetting. He had returned from his expedition to South America with a\nvaluable collection of fishes and other scientific materials; but his\ntheory of glaciers; which he went there to substantiate, had not been\nproven. Darwin’s “Origin of Species” had already swept his nicely-\nconstructed plans of original types into the fire of futile speculation.\nYet Agassiz was a great man in his way, and his importance was\nuniversally recognized. He had given a vigorous and much-needed impetus\nto the study of geology in America, and as a compendium of all the\ndifferent branches of natural history there was nobody like him. In his\nlifelong single-minded devotion to science he had few equals and no\nsuperiors. He cared not for money except so far as it helped the\nadvancement of his studies. For many years Madam Agassiz taught a select\nschool for young ladies (to which Emerson, among others, sent his\ndaughters), in order to provide funds for her husband to carry on his\nwork. It is to be feared that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was\nrather stingy to him. Edward Everett once made an eloquent address in his\nbehalf to the legislature, but it had no effect. Louis Napoleon’s\nmunificent offers could not induce him to return to Paris, for he\nbelieved that more important work was to be done in the new world,—\nwhich, by the way, he considered the oldest portion of the globe.",
        "In height and figure Agassiz was so much like Doctor Hill that when the\ntwo were together this was very noticeable. They were both broad-\nshouldered, deep-chested men, and of about the same height, with large,\nwell-rounded heads; but Agassiz had an elastic French step, whereas\nDoctor Hill walked with something of a shuffle. One might even imagine\nAgassiz dancing a waltz. Lowell said of him that he was “emphatically a\nman, and that wherever he went he made a friend.” His broad forehead\nseemed to smile upon you while he was talking, and from his simple-\nhearted and genial manners you felt that he would be a friend whenever\nyou wanted one. He was the busiest and at the same time one of the most\naccessible persons in the university.",
        "On one occasion, happening to meet a number of students at the corner of\nUniversity Building, one of them was bold enough to say to him: “Prof.\nAgassiz, would you be so good as to explain to us the difference between\nthe stone of this building and that of Boylston Hall? We know that they\nare both granite, but they do not look alike.” Agassiz was delighted, and\nentertained them with a brief lecture on primeval rocks and the crust of\nthe earth’s surface. He told them that Boylston Hall was made of syenite;\nthat most of the stone called granite in New England was syenite, and if\nthey wanted to see genuine granite they should go to the tops of the\nWhite Mountains. Then looking at his watch he said: “Ah, I see I am late!\nGood day, my friends; and I hope we shall all meet again.” So off he\nwent, leaving each of his hearers with the embryonic germ of a scientific\ninterest in his mind.",
        "Longfellow tells in his diary how Agassiz came to him when his health\nbroke down and wept. “I cannot work any longer,” he said; and when he\ncould not work he was miserable. The trouble that afflicted him was\ncongestion of the base of the brain, a disorder that is not caused so\nfrequently by overwork as by mental emotion. His cure by Dr. Edward H.\nClarke, by the use of bromides and the application of ice, was considered\na remarkable one at the time; but five years later the disorder returned\nagain and cost him his life.",
        "He believed that the Laurentian Mountains, north of the St. Lawrence\nRiver, was the first land which showed itself above the waste of waters\nwith which the earth was originally surmounted.",
        "Perhaps the most picturesque figure on the college grounds was the old\nGreek professor, Evangelinus Apostolides Sophocles; a genuine importation\nfrom Athens, whom the more imaginative sort of people liked to believe\nwas descended from the Greek poet Sophocles of the Periclean age. He was\nmuch too honest himself to give countenance to this rumor, and if you\ninquired of him concerning it, he would say that he should like very well\nto believe it, and it was not impossible, although there were no surnames\nin ancient Greece before the time of Constantine; he had not found any\nevidence in favor of it. He was a short, thick-set man with a large head\nand white Medusa-like hair; but such an eye as his was never seen in an\nAnglo-Saxon face. It reminded you at once of Byron’s Corsair, and\nsuggested contingencies such as find no place in quiet, law-abiding New\nEngland,—the possibility of sudden and terrible concentration. His\nclothing had been long since out of fashion, and he always wore a faded\ncloth cap, such as no student would dare to put on. He lived like a\nhermit in No. 3 Holworthy, where he prepared his own meals rather than\nencounter strange faces at a boarding-house table. Once he invited the\npresident of the college to supper; and the president went, not without\nsome misgivings as to what his entertainment might be. He found, however,\na simple but well-served repast, including a French roll and a cup of\nblack coffee with the grounds in it. The coffee loosened Sophocles’s\nusually reticent tongue, and after that, as the president himself\nexpressed it, they had a delightful conversation. Everybody respected\nSophocles in spite of his eccentric mode of life, and the Freshmen were\nas much afraid of him as if he had been the Minotaur of Crete.",
        "The reason for his economy did not become apparent until after his death.\nWhen he first came to the university he made friends with a gentleman in\nCambridge to whom he was much attached, but who, at the time we write of,\nhad long since been dead. It was to support the daughters of his friend,\nwho would have otherwise been obliged to earn their own living, that he\nsaved his money; and in his will he left them a competency of fifty\nthousand dollars or more.",
        "On one occasion a Freshman was sent to him to receive a private\nadmonition for writing profane language on a settee; but the Freshman\ndenied the accusation. Sophocles’s eyes twinkled. “Did you not,” said he,\n\"write the letters d-a-m-n?” “No,” said the boy, laughing; “it must have\nbeen somebody else.” Sophocles laughed and said he would report the case\nback to the college faculty. A few days later he stopped the youth in the\ncollege yard and, merely saying “I have had your private admonition\nrevoked,” passed on. Professor Sophocles was right. If the Freshman had\ntried to deceive him he would not have laughed but looked grave.",
        "The morning in April, 1861, after President Lincoln had issued his call\nfor 75,000 troops, a Harvard Senior mentioned it to Sophocles, who said\nto him: “What can the government accomplish with 75,000 soldiers? It is\ngoing to take half a million of men to suppress this rebellion.”",
        "He was a good instructor in his way, but dry and methodical. Professor\nGoodwin’s recitations were much more interesting. Sophocles did not\ncredit the tradition of Homer’s wandering about blind and poor to recite\nhis two great epics. He believed that Homer was a prince, or even a king,\nlike the psalmist David, and asserted that this could be proved or at\nleast rendered probable by internal evidence. This much is morally\ncertain, that if Homer became blind it must have been after middle life.\nTo describe ancient battle-scenes so vividly he must have taken part in\nthem; and his knowledge of anatomy is very remarkable. He does not make\nsuch mistakes in that line as bringing Desdemona to life after she has\nbeen smothered.",
        "How can we do justice to such a great-hearted man as Dr. Andrew P.\nPeabody? He was not intended by nature for a revolutionary character, and\nin that sense he was unsuited, like Everett, for the time in which he\nlived. If he had been chosen president of the university after the\nresignation of Doctor Hill, as George S. Hillard and other prominent\ngraduates desired, the great broadening and liberalizing of the\nuniversity, which has taken place since, would have been deferred for the\nnext fifteen years. He had little sympathy with the anti-slavery\nmovement, and was decidedly opposed to the religious liberalism of his\ntime; but Doctor Peabody’s interest lay in the salvation of human souls,\nand in this direction he had no equal. He felt a personal regard in every\nhuman being with whom he was acquainted, and this seemed more important\nto him than abstract schemes for the improvement of the race in general.\nHe was a man of peace and wished all others to be at peace; the confusion\nand irritation that accompanies reform was most disagreeable to him. Many\na Harvard student who trembled on the brink of an abyss, far from home\nand left to his own devices, afterwards looked back to Doctor Peabody’s\nhelping hand as to the hand of a beneficent providence held out to save\nhim from destruction; and those whom he was unable to save thought of him\nno less gratefully.",
        "In the autumn of 1864 a strange sort of student joined the Sophomore\nclass. He soon proved that he was one of the best scholars in it; but to\njudge from his recitations it was long since he had been to school or\nreceived any regular instruction. He lived chiefly on bread and milk, and\nseemed not to have learned how to take exercise. It is feared that he\nsuffered much from loneliness in that busy hive, where everyone has so\nmany small affairs of his own to attend to. Just before the annual\nexaminations he was seized with brain-fever and died. Doctor Peabody\nconducted the funeral services at the boarding-house of the unfortunate\nyouth, and the plainness of the surroundings heightened the eloquence of\nhis address. His prayer on that occasion was so much above the average\ncharacter of his religious discourses that it seemed to come from a\nsecret fountain of the man’s nature, which could only be drawn upon for\ngreat occasions.",
        "With all his tenderness of feeling Doctor Peabody could be a very\nvigorous debater. He once carried on a newspaper argument with Rev. Dr.\nMinor, of Boston, on the temperance question, in which he took the ground\nthat drinking wine and beer did not necessarily lead to intemperance,—\nwhich, rightly considered, indicates a lack of self-control; and he made\nthis point in what his friends, at least, considered a satisfactory and\nconclusive manner.",
        "It is pleasant to think that such a man should have met with unusual\nprosperity in his old age—and the person to whom he owed this\nimprovement of his affairs was Nathaniel Thayer, of Boston. Mr. Thayer\ntook charge of Doctor Peabody’s property and trebled or quadrupled it in\nvalue. Mr. Thayer was very fond of doing such kindnesses to his friends,\nespecially to clergymen. He liked the society of clergymen, and certainly\nin this he showed excellent judgment. During the last ten years of his\nlife he spent his summers at the Isles of Shoals, and generally with one\nor more reverend gentlemen in his company. He was besides a most\nmunificent patron of the university. He provided the means for Agassiz to\ngo on his expedition to South America, and in conjunction with Doctor\nHill reestablished commons for the students—a reform, as he once stated,\nas advantageous to their morals as to their purses. He afterwards built\nthe dormitory which is known by his name. He was so kind-hearted, that he\nwas said to have given up banking because he was not hard-hearted enough\nfor the profession. After his death his family received letters upon\nletters from persons of whom they had never heard, but who wished to\nexpress their gratitude for his generosity.",
        "Prof. Benjamin Pierce, the mathematician, was rather an awe-inspiring\nfigure as he strolled through the college grounds, recognizing few and\nspeaking to none—apparently oblivious to everything except the internal\nlife which he led in the “functions of curves” and “celestial mechanics.\"\nHe was a fine-looking man, with his ashen-gray hair and beard, his wide\nbrow and features more than usually regular. When he was observed\nconversing with President Hill the fine scholars shook their heads wisely\nas if something remarkable was taking place. The president had said in\none of his addresses to the Freshmen that it would require a whole\ngeneration to utilize Professor Pierce’s discoveries in algebra; and I\nbelieve, at last accounts, they have not been utilized yet. He would\noften be seen in the horse-cars making figures on scraps of paper, which\nhe carried with him for the purpose, oblivious as ever to what was taking\nplace about him. To “have a head like old Benny Pierce” has become a\nproverb in Boston and Cambridge.",
        "Neither did he lack independence of character. In his later years he not\nunfrequently attended the meetings of the Radical Club, or Chestnut\nStreet Club, at Mrs. John T. Sargent’s, in Boston, a place looked upon\nwith pious horror by good Doctor Peabody, and equally discredited by the\nyoung positivists whom President Eliot had introduced in the college\nfaculty. His remarks on such occasions were fresh, original, and very\ninteresting; and once he brought down the house with laughter and\napplause by explaining the mental process which prevented him from\nappreciating a joke until after all others had done so. This naive\nconfession made his audience like him.",
        "It is a curious geneological fact that Professor Pierce had a son named\nafter him who would seem to have been born in mirth, to have lived in\ncomedy, and died in a jest. He was a college Yorick who produced roars of\nlaughter in the Dicky and Hasty Pudding clubs. Another son, called\naffectionately by the students “Jimmy Mills,” was also noted for his wit,\nand much respected as an admirable instructor.",
        "Doctor Holmes says, in Parson Turell’s Legacy:",
        "This describes Cambridge as it was forty years since. In spite of its\ntimid conservatism and rather donnish society, as Professor Child termed\nit, it was one of the pleasantest places to live in on this side the\nAtlantic. It was a community of a refined and elegant industry, in which\nevery one had a definite work to do, and seemed to be exactly fitted to\nhis or her place,—not without some great figures, too, to give it\nexceptional interest. There was peace and repose under the academic\nshade, and the obliviousness of its inhabitants to the outside world only\nrendered this more restful.",
        "How changed is it now! The old Holmes house has been long since pulled\ndown to make way for the new Law-School building. Red-gravel paths\nhave been replaced by brick sidewalks; huge buildings rise before\nthe eye; electric cars whiz in every direction; a tall, bristling\niron fence surrounds the college yard; and an enormous clock on the\ntower of Memorial Hall detonates the hours in a manner which is by no\nmeans conducive to the sleep of the just and the rest of the weary. The\nelderly graduate, returning to the dreamland of his youth, finds that it\nhas actually become a dreamland and still exists only in his imagination.",
        "The university has broadened and extended itself wonderfully under the\npresent management, but the simple classic charm of the olden time is\ngone forever.",
        "Fifty years ago it was the fashion at Harvard, as well as at other\ncolleges, for professors to cultivate an austere dignity of manner for\nthe purpose of preserving order and decorum in the recitation-room; but\nthis frequently resulted in having the opposite effect and served as a\ntemptation to the students to play practical jokes on their instructors.\nThe habitual dryness of the college exercises in Latin, Greek, and\nmathematics became still more wearisome from the manner in which these\nwere conducted. The youthful mind thirsting for knowledge found the road\nto it for the most part a dull and dreary pilgrimage.",
        "Professor Francis J. Child would seem to have been the first to break\ndown this barrier and establish more friendly relations with his classes.\nHe was naturally well adapted to this. Perfectly frank and fearless in\nhis dealings with all men, he hated unnecessary conventionality, and at\nthe same time possessed the rare art of preserving his dignity while\nassociating with his subordinates on friendly terms. Always kindly and\neven sympathetic to the worst scapegraces in the division, he could\nassert the superiority of his position with a quickness that often\nstartled those who were inclined to impose on him. He did not call out\nthe names of his class as if they were exceptions to a rule in Latin\ngrammar, but addressed each one of them as if he felt a personal interest\nin the man; so that they felt encouraged to speak out what they knew and\neven remembered their lessons so much the better. As a consequence he was\nuniversally respected, and there were many who felt an affection for him\nsuch as he could never have imagined. His cordial manner was sufficient\nof itself to make his instruction effective.",
        "Francis J. Child was the first scholar in his class at the Boston Latin\nSchool, and afterwards at Harvard. That first scholars do not come to\nmuch good in the world is an illusion of the envious. It is true that\nthey sometimes break down their health by too strenuous an effort, but\nthis may happen to an ambitious person in any undertaking. In Professor\nChild’s case, as in many another, it proved the making of his fortune,\nfor which he did not possess any exceptional advantages. Being of an\namiable disposition and good address, he was offered a tutorship on\ngraduation, and rose from one position in the university to another until\nhe became the first authority on the English language in America. His\nwhole life was spent at Harvard College, with the exception of a few\nshort expeditions to Europe; and his influence there steadily increased\nuntil it became a power that was universally recognized.",
        "He was a short, thick-set man, like Sophocles, but as different as\npossible in general aspect. Sophocles was always slow and measured, but\nProfessor Child was quick and lively in all his movements; and his face\nwore an habitual cheerfulness which plainly showed the sunny spirit\nwithin. Most characteristic in his appearance was the short curly yellow\nhair, so light in color that when it changed with age, his friends\nscarcely noticed the difference.",
        "During his academic years he created a sensation by declining to join the\nHasty Pudding Club. This was looked upon as a piece of inordinate self-\nconceit; whereas, the true reason for it was that he had little money and\npreferred to spend it in going to the theatre. He said afterwards, in\nregard to this, that he was not sorry to have done it, for “the students\nplaced too much importance on such matters.”",
        "Through his interest in fine acting, he became one of the best judges of\noratory, and it was always interesting to listen to him on that subject.\nHe considered Wendell Phillips the perfection of form and delivery, and\nsometimes very brilliant, but much too rash in his statements. Everett\nwas also good, but lacked warmth and earnestness. Choate was purely a\nlegal pleader, and outside of the court-room not very effective. He\nthought Webster one of the greatest of orators, fully equal to Cicero;\nbut they both lacked the poetical element. Sumner’s sentences were florid\nand his delivery rather mechanical, but he made a strong impression owing\nto the evident purity of his motives. The general public, however, had\nbecome suspicious of oratory, so that it was no longer as serviceable as\nformerly.",
        "“After all,” he would say, “the main point for a speaker is to have a\ngood cause. Then, if he is thoroughly in earnest, we enjoy hearing him.\"\nHe once illustrated his subject by the story of a Union general who tried\nto rally the fugitives at Pittsburg Landing, and said, waving his sword\nin the air: “In the name of the Declaration of Independence, I command, I\nexhort you,” etc., while a private soldier leaning against a tree, with a\nquid of tobacco in his mouth, remarked, “That man can make a good\nspeech,” but showed no intentions of moving. This summary, however, gives\nno adequate idea of the brightness of Professor Child’s conversation. He\nwas an animated talker, full of wit and originality.",
        "When the classes at Harvard were smaller than at present, he would\narrange them in University Hall for declamation, so as to cover as much\nspace as possible. They did not understand this until he said, “Now we\nhave a larger audience, if not more numerous;” and this placed every one\nin the best of humor.",
        "Besides his regular college duties, Professor Child had three distinct\ninterests to which he devoted himself in leisure hours with all the\nenergy of an ardent nature. The first of these, editing a complete\nedition of the old English ballads, was the labor of his life, and with\nit his name will always be associated, for it is a work that can neither\nbe superseded nor excelled. He was the first to arouse English scholars\nto the importance of this, as may be read in the dedication of a partial\nedition taken from the Percy manuscripts and published in London in 1861.\nHe recognized in them the true foundation of the finest literature of the\nmodern world, and he considered them so much the better from the fact\nthat they were not composed to be printed, but to be recited or sung.\nMatthew Arnold wrote in a letter from America: “After lecturing at\nTaunton, I came to Boston with Professor Child of Harvard, a very\npleasant man, who is a great authority on ballad poetry,” very warm\npraise, considering the source whence it came. Late in life Professor\nChild edited separate versions in modern English of some curious old\nballads, and sent them as Christmas presents to his friends. It is not\nsurprising that he should have been interested as well in the rude songs\nof the British sailors, which he heard on crossing the ocean. He was\nmightily amused at their simple refrain:",
        "“That rude couplet,” he said, “contains all the original elements of\npoetry. Firstly, the anthropomorphic element; the sailor imagines his\nbowline as if it had life. Secondly, the humorous element, for the\nbowline is all tail. Thirdly, the reflective element; the monotonous\nmotion makes him think of home,—of his wife or sweetheart,—and he ends\nthe second line with ’Kitty, O, my darlin’.’ I like such primitive verses\nmuch better than the ’Pike County Ballads,’ a mixture of sentiment and\nprofanity.”",
        "Then he went on to say: “I want my children, when they grow up, to read\nthe classics. My boy will go to college, of course; and he will translate\nHomer and Virgil, and Horace,—I think very highly of Horace; but the\nliteral meaning is a different thing from understanding the poetry. Then\nmy daughters will learn French and German, and I shall expect them to\nread Schiller and Goethe, Moliere and Racine, as well as Shakespeare and\nMilton. After that they can read what they like, but they will have a\nstandard by which to judge other authors.” He was afraid that the\nstudents wasted too much time in painting play-bills and other similar\nexercises of ingenuity, which lead to nothing in the end.",
        "He gave some excellent advice to a young lady who was about visiting\nEurope for the first time, who doubted if she could properly appreciate\nthe works of art and other fine things that she would be called upon to\nadmire. “Don’t be afraid of that,” said Professor Child; “you will\nprobably like best just those sights which you do not expect to; but if\nyou do not like them, say so, and let that be the end of it. Now, I am so\nunfortunate as not to appreciate Michel Angelo. His great horned Moses is\nnothing more to me than a Silenus in a garden. The fact does not trouble\nme much, for I find enough to interest me as it is, and I can enjoy life\nwithout the Moses.”",
        "After mentioning a number of desirable expeditions, he added: “You will\ngo to Dresden, of course, to see Raphael’s Madonna and Titian’s ’Tribute\nMoney’; and then there are the Green Vaults. I have known the Green\nVaults to have an excellent effect on some ladies of my acquaintance.\nThey did not care one-quarter as much for a diamond ring as they did\nbefore they went into the Green Vaults. You will see a jewelled fireplace\nthere which is worth more than all I own in the world.” The young lady\nlooked, however, as if it would take more than the Green Vaults to cure\nher love for jewelry.",
        "Professor Child’s second important interest was politics, and as a rule\nhe much preferred talking on this to literary subjects.",
        "Josiah Quincy was the most distinguished president that Harvard College\nhas had, unless we except President Eliot; and his admirers have been\naccustomed to refer to his administration as “Consule Planco.” His\npolitics did not differ widely from those of John Quincy Adams, who was\nthe earliest statesman of the anti-slavery struggle, and a true hero in\nhis way. After Quincy, the presidents of the university became more and\nmore conservative, until Felton, who was a pronounced pro-slavery Whig,\nand even attempted to defend the invasion of Kansas in a public meeting.\nThe professors and tutors naturally followed in the train of the\npresident, while a majority of the sons of wealthy men among the\nundergraduates always took the southern side. The son of an abolitionist\nwho wished to go through Harvard in those days found it a penitential\npilgrimage. He was certain to suffer an extra amount of hazing, and to\nendure a kind of social ostracism throughout the course.",
        "For many years before the election of Lincoln, Professors Child, Lowell,\nand Jennison were the only pronounced anti-slavery members of the\nfaculty; and this left Francis J. Child to hear the brunt of it almost\nalone, for Lowell’s connection with the university was semi-detached, and\nalthough he was always prepared to face the enemy in an honest argument,\nhe was not often on the ground to do so.",
        "Now that the most potent cause of political agitation resides in the far-\noff problem of the Philippine Islands it is difficult to realize the\npopular excitement of those times, when both parties believed that the\nvery existence of the nation depended on the result of the elections.\nProfessor Child was not the least of an alarmist, and deprecated all\nunnecessary controversy. In 1861 he even cautioned Wendell Phillips\nGarrison against introducing too strong an appeal for emancipation in his\ncommencement address; but he was as firm as a granite rock on any\nquestion of principle, and when he considered a protest in order he was\ncertain to make one. He did not trust party newspapers for his\ninformation, but obtained it from persons who were in a position to know,\nand his facts were so well supported by the quick sallies of his wit that\nthose who interfered with him once rarely attempted it again. Moreover,\nas we all see now, he had the right on his side.",
        "He was proud of having voted twice for Abraham Lincoln. What he thought\nof John Brown, at the time of the Harper’s Ferry raid, is uncertain; but\nmany years later, when one of his friends published a small book in\nvindication of Brown against the attack of Lincoln’s two secretaries, he\nwrote to him:",
        "“I congratulate you on the success of your statement, which I have read\nwith very great interest. John Brown was like a star and still shines in\nthe firmament. We could not have done without him.”",
        "He considered Governor Andrew’s approbation of John Brown as more\nimportant than anything that would be written about him in the future.",
        "He did not trouble himself much in regard to Lincoln’s second election,\nfor he saw that it was a foregone conclusion; but after Andrew Johnson’s\ntreachery in 1866, he felt there was a need of unusual exertion. When the\nNovember elections arrived, he told his classes: “Next Tuesday I shall\nhave to serve my country and there will be no recitations.” When Tuesday\ncame we found him on the sidewalk distributing Republican ballots and\nsoliciting votes; and there he remained until the polls closed in the\nafternoon. He had little patience with educated men who neglected their\npolitical duties. “Why are you discouraged?” he would ask. “Times will\nchange. Remember the Free-soil movement!” He attended caucuses as\nregularly as the meetings of the faculty, and served as a delegate to a\nnumber of conventions. More than once he aroused the good citizens of\nCambridge to the danger of insidious plots by low demagogues against the\npublic welfare. The poet Longfellow took notice of this and spoke of him\nas an invaluable man.",
        "On another occasion Professor Child was discoursing to his class on\noratory and mentioned the fact that Webster and Choate both came from\nDartmouth; that Wendell Phillips graduated at Harvard, but the university\nhad not seen much of him since. At the mention of Wendell Phillips some\nof the boys from pro-slavery families began to sneer. Professor Child\nraised himself up and said determinedly, “Wendell Phillips is as good an\norator as either of them!” He was chagrined, however, at Phillips’s later\npublic course,—his support of Socialism and General Butler. Neither did\nhe like Phillips’s Phi Beta Kappa oration, in which he advocated the\ndagger and dynamite for tyrants. “A tyrant,” said Professor Child, “is\nwhat anyone chooses to imagine. My hired man may consider me a tyrant and\nblow me up according to Mr. Phillips’s principle.” The assassins of\nGarfield and McKinley evidently supposed that they were ridding the earth\nof two of the worst tyrants that ever existed. Professor Child was\nexceptionally liberal. He even supported Woman Suffrage for a time, but\nhe held Socialism in a kind of holy horror,—such as one feels of a\nperson who is always making blunders.",
        "In 1878 Professor Child and some other political reformers were elected\nto a Congressional convention and went with the hope of securing a\ncandidate who would represent the educated classes,—the incumbent at\nthat time being a shoe manufacturer. They argued and worked hard all day,\nbut without success. Late in the afternoon the shoe manufacturer, a\nworthy man but very ignorant, who afterwards became governor of the\nState, was renominated; and when it was proposed to make the nomination\nunanimous Professor Child called out such an emphatic No that it seemed\nto shake the whole assembly. Not content with this he entered a protest\nnext day in the Boston Advertiser. He was so much used up by the\nexertion that he was unable to attend to his classes. Some years later he\nenjoyed the satisfaction of seeing his candidate, Theodore Lyman,\nnominated and elected.",
        "Emerson once delivered a lecture in Boston on university life in which he\nmade the rather bold statement that “in the course of twenty years the\nrank-list is likely to become inverted.” One of Professor Child’s class\nparaphrased this lecture for a theme, and against the sentence above\nquoted the Professor wrote: “A statement frequently made, but what is the\nfact?” I do not think he liked Emerson quite so well after this, and he\ncan hardly be blamed for feeling so. It was not only a disparagement of\ngood scholarship but like a personal slight upon himself. That Emerson\ngraduated near the foot of his class ought not to prove that an idle\ncollege life is a sign of genius.",
        "Professor Child talked freely in regard to the meetings of the college\nfaculty, for he believed that graduates had a right to know about them.\nHe quoted some amusing anecdotes of a certain professor who led the\nopposition against President Eliot and praised the dignified manner with\nwhich Eliot regarded him. In 1879 he said one day:",
        "“We are in the half-way stage between a college and a university, and\nthere is consequently great confusion. If we once became a university,\npure and simple, all that would be over; but the difficulty is that the\nmaterial which comes to us is so poor. I do not mean that the young men\nare lacking in intelligence, but the great majority of them do not brace\nthemselves to the work. As Doctor Hedge says, the heart of the college is\nin the boating and ball-playing and not in its studies.”",
        "His third occupation and chief recreation was his rose-garden. The whole\nspace between his front piazza and Kirkland Street was filled with rose-\nbushes which he tended himself, from the first loosening of the earth in\nspring until the straw sheaf-caps were tied about them in November. What\nmore delightful occupation for a scholar than working in a rose-garden!\nThere his friends were most likely to find him in suitable weather, and\nwhen June came they were sure to receive a share of the bountiful\nblossoms; nor did he ever forget the sick and suffering.",
        "He was greatly interested to hear of a German doctor at Munich who had a\nrose-garden with more than a hundred varieties in it. “I should like to\nknow that man,” he said; “wouldn’t we have a good talk together?” He\ncomplained that although everybody liked roses few were sufficiently\ninterested in them to distinguish the different kinds. Naturally rose-\nbugs were his special detestation. “Saving your presence,” he said to\nPresident Felton’s daughter, “I will crush this insect;” to which she\naptly replied, “I certainly would not have my presence save him.” When he\nheard of the Buffalo-bug he exclaimed: “Are we going to have another pest\nto contend with? I think it is a serious question whether the insect\nworld is not going to get the better of us.”",
        "After his painful death at the Massachusetts Hospital in September, 1896,\nthe president and fellows of the university voted to set apart little\nHolden Chapel, the oldest building on the college grounds, and yet one of\nthe most dignified, for an English library dedicated to the memory of\nFrancis J. Child. Such an honor had never been decreed for president or\nprofessor before; and it gives him the distinction that we all feel he\ndeserved. It is much more appropriate to him, and satisfactory than a\nmarble statue in Saunders Theatre would have been, or a stained-glass\nwindow in Memorial Hall. Yet his presence still lingers in the memory of\nhis friends, like the fragrance of his own roses, after the petals have\nfallen from their stems.",
        "It has been estimated that there were four hundred poets in England in\nthe time of Shakespeare, and in the century during which Dante lived\nEurope fairly swarmed with poets, many of them of high excellence.\nFrederick II. of Germany and Richard I. of England were both good poets,\nand were as proud of their verses as they were of their military\nexploits. Frederick II. may be said to have founded the vernacular in\nwhich Dante wrote; and Longfellow rendered into English a poem of\nRichard’s which he composed during his cruel imprisonment in Austria. A\nknight who could not compose a song and sing it to the guitar was as rare\nas a modern gentleman of fashion who cannot play golf. When James Russell\nLowell resigned the chair of poetry at Harvard no one could be found who\ncould exactly fill his place, and it was much the same at Oxford after\nMatthew Arnold retired.",
        "The difference between then and now would seem to reside in the fact,\nthat poetry is more easily remembered than prose. From the time of Homer\nuntil long after the invention of printing, not only were ballad-singers\nand harpers in good demand, but the recital of poetry was also a favorite\nmeans of livelihood to indigent scholars and others, who wandered about\nlike the minstrels. The “article,” as Tom Moore called it, was in active\nrequest. Poetry was recited in the camp of Alexander, in the Roman baths,\nin the castles on the Rhine, and English hostelries. Now it is replaced\nby novel-reading, and there are few who know how much pleasure can be\nderived on a winter’s evening by impromptu poetic recitations. If a\npopular interest in poetry should revive again, I have no doubt that\nhundreds of poets would spring up, as it were, out of the ground and fill\nthe air with their pleasant harmonies. The editor of the Atlantic\ninformed Professor Child that he had a whole barrelful of poetry in his\nhouse, much of it excellent, but that there was no use he could make of\nit.",
        "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was as irrepressible a rhymer as John Watts\nhimself, and fortunately he had a father who recognized the value of his\ntalent and assisted him in a judicious manner, instead of placing\nobstacles in his way, as the father of Watts is supposed to have done.\nThe account that Rev. Samuel Longfellow has given us of the youth of his\nbrother is highly instructive, and ought to be of service to all young\nmen who fancy they are destined by nature for a poetic career. He tells\nus how Henry published his first poem in the Portland Gazette, and\nhow his boyish exultation was dashed with cold water the same evening by\nJudge ——, who said of it in his presence: “Stiff, remarkably stiff, and\nall the figures are borrowed.”",
        "The “Fight at Lovell’s Pond” would not have been a remarkable poem for a\nyouth of nineteen, but it showed very good promise for the age at which\nit was written. Few boys at that age can write anything that will hang\ntogether as a poem. Young Longfellow was a better poet at thirteen than\nhis father’s friend, the Judge, was a critic. His verses were by no means\nstiff, but on the contrary showed indications of that natural grace and\nfacility of expression for which he became afterwards distinguished. As\nfor the originality of his comparisons it is doubtful also if the Judge\ncould have proved his point on that question. They were original to\nHenry, if to nobody else.",
        "Fortunately for Henry he was also a fine scholar. The following year saw\nhim enter as a Freshman at Bowdoin College, which was equal to entering\nHarvard at the age of fifteen. Look out for the youngest members of a\ncollege class! They may not distinguish themselves at the university, but\nthey are the ones who, if they live, outstrip all others. But Longfellow\ndid distinguish himself. In his Junior year he composed seventeen poems\nwhich were published, then and afterwards, in the United States\nLiterary Gazette, where his name appeared beside that of William\nCullen Bryant. This was quite exceptional in the history of American\nliterature, and as the editor of the Literary Gazette stated it:\n\"A young tree which puts forth so many blossoms is likely to bear good\nfruits.”",
        "With the close of his college course came the important question of\nLongfellow’s future occupation. His father, with good practical judgment,\nforesaw that poetry alone would not serve to make his son self-supporting\nand independent; but the boy hated to give this up for a more prosaic\nemployment. While the discussion was going on between them, the\nauthorities of Bowdoin solved the problem for them both by offering young\nLongfellow a professorship of modern languages on condition that he would\nspend two years in Europe preparing himself for the position. He had\ngraduated fourth in his class.",
        "Does not this prove the advantage of good scholarship? Was the rank list\ninverted in Longfellow’s case? I think not. He had lived a virtuous and\nindustrious life, not studying for rank or honor, but because he enjoyed\ndoing what was right and fit for a young man to do; and now the reward\nhad come to him, like the sun breaking through the clouds which seemed to\nobscure his future prospects. Still, there was a hard road before him. It\nis very pleasant to travel rapidly through foreign countries, seeing the\nbest that is in them and to return home with a multitude of fresh\nimpressions; but living and working a long time in another country seems\ntoo much like exile. The loneliness of the situation becomes a weary\nburden, and it is dangerous from its very loneliness. Many have died or\nlost their health under such conditions (in fact Longfellow came near\nlosing his life from Roman fever), and he wrote from Paris: “Here one can\nkeep evil at a distance as well as elsewhere, though, to be sure,\ntemptations are multiplied a thousand-fold if he is willing to enter into\nthem.” A young man’s first experience in London or Paris is a dangerous\nsense of freedom; for all the customary restraints of his daily life have\nbeen removed.",
        "Mrs. Stowe says of her beautiful character, “Eva St. Clair,” that all bad\ninfluences rolled off from her like dew from a cabbage leaf, and it was\nthe same with Longfellow throughout. He lived in France, Spain, Italy,\nand Germany, and then returned to Portland, the same true American as\nwhen he left there, without foreign ways or modes of thinking, and with\nno more than the slight aroma of a foreign air upon him. Longfellow and\nhis whole family were natural cosmopolitans. There was nothing of the\nproverbial Yankee in their composition.",
        "Whittier was a Quaker by creed, but he was also much of a Yankee in style\nand manner. Emerson looked like a Yankee, and possessed the cool Yankee\nshrewdness. Lowell’s “Biglow Papers” testified to the fundamental Yankee;\nbut the Longfellows were endowed with a peculiar refinement and purity\nwhich seemed to distinguish them as much in Cambridge or London as it did\nin Portland, where there has always been a rather superior sort of\nsociety. It was like French refinement without being Gallic. No wonder\nthat a famous poet should emanate from such a family.",
        "What we notice especially in the Longfellow Letters during this European\nsojourn is the admonition of Henry’s father, that German literature was\nmore important than Italian,—and the poet was always largely influenced\nby this afterwards; that Henry did not find Paris particularly\nattractive, and on the whole preferred the Spanish character to the\nFrench on account of its deeper under-currents; that he did not seem to\nrealize the danger that menaced him from Spanish brigands, in spite of\nthe black crosses by the roadside; and that he was not vividly impressed\nby the famous works of art in the Louvre gallery. He only notices that\none of Correggio’s figures resembles a young lady in Portland.",
        "Longfellow would seem to have been always the same in regard to his\nappreciation of art. When he was in Italy, in 1869, he visited all the\npicture galleries and evidently enjoyed doing so; but it was easy to see\nthat his brother, Rev. Samuel Longfellow, felt a much livelier interest\nin the subject than he did; and injured frescos or mutilated statues,\nlike the Torso of the Belvidere, were objects of aversion to him. Poets\nand musical composers see more with their ears than they do with their\neyes.",
        "The single work of art that attracted him strongly at this time was a\nstatue of Venus, by Canova, which he compares to the Venus de’ Medici,\nand his brother Samuel remarks that he was always more attracted by\nsculpture than painting. Canova was a genius very similar to Longfellow\nhimself, as nearly as an Italian could be made to match an American, and\nhe was then at the height of his reputation.",
        "In 1829 Longfellow returned to Portland and was immediately chosen a\nprofessor at Bowdoin College, where he remained for the next seven years.\nWhen, in 1836, Professor Ticknor retired from his position as instructor\nof modern languages at Harvard, his place was offered to Longfellow and\naccepted. This brought him into the literary centre of New England, and\none of the first acquaintances he made there was Charles Sumner, who was\nlecturing before the Harvard Law-School.",
        "The friendship between these two great men commenced at once and only\nceased at Sumner’s death in 1874, when Longfellow wrote one of the finest\nof his shorter poems in tribute to Sumner’s memory. It was as poetic a\nfriendship as that between Emerson and Carlyle; but whereas Emerson and\nCarlyle had differences of opinion, Sumner and Longfellow were always of\none mind. When Sumner made his Fanueil Hall speech against the fugitive\nslave law, which was simply fighting revolution with revolution, and\nHarvard College and the whole of Cambridge turned against him, Longfellow\nstood firm; and it may be suspected that he had many an unpleasant\ndiscussion with his aristocratic acquaintances on this point. It was\nconsidered bad enough to support Garrison, but supporting Sumner was a\ngreat deal worse, for Sumner was an orator who wielded a power only\ninferior to Webster. Fortunately for Longfellow, his connection with the\nuniversity ceased not long after Sumner’s election to the Senate; and the\nunpleasantness of his position may have been the leading cause of his\nretirement.",
        "Sumner was the best friend Longfellow had, and perhaps the best that he\ncould have had. There was Emerson, of course, and Longfellow was always\non friendly terms with him; but Emerson had a habit of catechising his\ncompanions which some of them did not altogether like; and this may have\nbeen the case with Longfellow, for they never became very intimate.\nSumner, on the contrary, had always a large stock of information to\ndispense, not only concerning American affairs but those of other\nnations, in which Longfellow never lost his interest. More important to\nhim even than this is the fact that Sumner’s statements were always to be\ntrusted. It may be surmised that it was not so much similarity of opinion\nas the purity of their motives that brought the poet and statesman\ntogether.",
        "As soon as Sumner returned from Washington, in spring or summer, he would\ngo out to call on Longfellow; and it was a pleasant sight to see them\nwalking together on a June evening beneath the overarching elms of\nhistoric Brattle Street. They were a pair of majestic-looking men; and\nthough Longfellow was nearly a head shorter than Sumner, his broad\nshoulders gave him an appearance of strength, as his capacious head and\nstrong, finely cut features evidently denoted an exceptional intellect.\nHe wore his hair poetically long, almost to his coat collar; and yet\nthere was not the slightest air of the Bohemian about him. They seemed to\nbe oblivious of everything except their conversation; and if this could\nhave been recorded it might prove to be as interesting as the poetry of\nthe one and the orations of the other. They were evidently talking on\ngreat subjects, and the earnestness on Sumner’s face was reflected on\nLongfellow’s as in a mirror.",
        "Hawthorne was a classmate of Longfellow, and in the biography of the\nlatter there are a number of letters from one to the other which are\nalways friendly,—but never more than that on Hawthorne’s side,—with one\nexception, where he thanks Longfellow for a complimentary review of\n\"Twice-Told Tales” in the North American. At that time the\nNorth American was considered an authority which could make or\nunmake an author’s reputation; and Longfellow may be said to have opened\nthe door for Hawthorne into the great world. Hawthorne’s friendship for\nPresident Pierce proved an advantage to him financially, but it also\nbecame a barrier between him and the other literary men of his time. Of\ncourse he believed what his friend Pierce told him concerning public\naffairs, and when he found that his other friends had not the same faith\nin Pierce’s veracity he became more strongly a partisan of the pro-\nslavery cause on that account. Longfellow frankly admitted that he did\nnot understand Hawthorne, and he did not believe that anyone at Bowdoin\nCollege understood him. He was the most secretive man that he ever knew;\nbut so far as genius was concerned, he believed that Hawthorne would\noutlive every other writer of his time. He had the will of a great\nconqueror.",
        "Goethe has been called the pampered child of genius, of fortune, and the\nmuse; but if Goethe had greater celebrity he never enjoyed half the\nworldly prosperity of Longfellow. While Emerson was earning a hard\nlivelihood by lecturing in the West, and Whittier was dwelling in a\ncountry farm-house, Longfellow occupied one of the most desirable\nresidences in or about Boston, and had all the means at his command that\na modest man could wish for. The Craigie House was, and still remains,\nthe finest residence in Cambridge,—\"formerly the head-quarters of\nWashington, and afterwards of the Muses.” Good architecture never becomes\nantiquated, and the Craigie House is not only spacious within, but\ndignified without.",
        "One could best realize Longfellow’s opulence by walking through his\nlibrary adjacent to the eastern piazza, and gazing at the magnificent\neditions of foreign authors which had been presented to him by his\nfriends and admirers; especially the fine set of Chateaubriand’s works,\nin all respects worthy of a royal collection. There is no ornament in a\nhouse that testifies to the quality of the owner like a handsome library.",
        "Byron would seem to have been the only other poet that has enjoyed such\nprosperity, although Bryant, as editor of a popular newspaper, may have\napproached it closely; but a city house, with windows on only two sides,\nis not like a handsome suburban residence. Longfellow could look across\nthe Cambridge marshes and see the sunsets reflected in the water of the\nCharles River.",
        "Here he lived from 1843, when he married Miss Appleton, a daughter of one\nof the wealthiest merchant-bankers of Boston, until his death by\npneumonia in March, 1882. The situation seemed suited to him, and he\nalways remained a true poet and devoted to the muses:",
        "He did not believe in a luxurious life except so far as luxury added to\nrefinement, and everything in the way of fashionable show was very\ndistasteful to him. His brother Samuel once said, “I cannot imagine\nanything more disagreeable than to ride in a public procession;” and the\ntwo men were more alike than brothers often are. We notice in the poet’s\ndiary that he abstains from going to a certain dinner in Boston for fear\nof being called upon to make a speech. Craigie House gave Longfellow the\nopportunity in which he most delighted,—of entertaining his friends and\ndistinguished foreign guests in a handsome manner; but conventional\ndinner parties, with their fourteen plates half surrounded by wine-\nglasses, were not often seen there. He much preferred a smaller number of\nguests with the larger freedom of discourse which accompanies a select\ngathering. Many such occasions are referred to in his diary,—as if he\ndid not wish to forget them.",
        "He was the finest host and story-teller in the country. His genial\ncourtesy was simply another expression of that mental grace which made\nhis reputation as a poet, and his manner of reciting an incident,\notherwise trivial, would give it the same additional quality as in his\nverses on Springfield Arsenal and the crooked Songo River, which without\nLongfellow would be little or nothing. Then his fund of information was\nwhat might be expected from a man who had lived in all the countries of\nwestern Europe.",
        "He had humble and unfortunate friends whom he seemed to think as much of\nas though they were distinguished. He recognized fine traits of\ncharacter, perhaps real greatness of character, in out-of-the-way\nplaces,—men whose chief happiness was their acquaintance with\nLongfellow. It was something much better than charity; and Professor\nChild spoke of it on the day of Emerson’s funeral as the finest flower in\nthe poet’s wreath.",
        "Longfellow was one of the kindest friends that the Hungarian exiles found\nwhen they came to Boston in 1852. Longfellow helped Kossuth, subscribed\nto Kalapka’s riding-school, and entertained a number of them at his\nhouse. Afterwards, when one of the exiles set up a business in Hungarian\nwines, Longfellow made a large purchase of him, which he spoke of twenty\nyears later with much satisfaction. He liked Tokay, and also the white\nwine of Capri, which he regretted could not be obtained in America.",
        "Those who supposed that Longfellow was easily imposed upon made a great\nmistake. He had the reputation among his publishers of understanding\nbusiness affairs better than any author in New England; but he was almost\ntoo kind-hearted. Somewhere about 1859 a photographer made an excellent\npicture of his daughters—indeed, it was a charming group—and the man\nbegged Mr. Longfellow for permission to sell copies of it as it would be\nof great advantage to him. Longfellow complied and the consequence was\nthat in 1860 one could hardly open a photograph album anywhere without\nfinding Longfellow’s daughters in it. Then a vulgar story originated that\nthe youngest daughter had only one arm, because her left arm was hidden\nbehind her sister. It is to be hoped that Longfellow never heard of this,\nfor if he did it must have caused him a good deal of pain, in return for\nhis kindness; but that is what one gets. Fortunately the photographs have\nlong since faded out.",
        "Much in the same line was his interest in the children of the poor. A\nragged urchin seemed to attract him much more than one that was nicely\ndressed. Perhaps they seemed more poetic to him, and he could see more\ndeeply into the joys and sorrows of their lives.",
        "Where the Episcopal Theological School now stands on Brattle Street there\nwas formerly a sort of tenement-house; and one day, as we were taking a\nstroll before dinner, we noticed three small boys with dirty faces\nstanding at the corner of the building; and just then one of them cried\nout: “Oh, see; here he comes!” And immediately Longfellow appeared\nleaving the gate of Craigie House. We passed him before he reached the\nchildren, but on looking back we saw that he had stopped to speak with\nthem. They evidently knew him very well.",
        "It is remarkable how the impression should have been circulated that\nLongfellow was not much of a pedestrian. On the contrary, there was no\none who was seen more frequently on the streets of Cambridge. He walked\nwith a springy step and a very slight swing of the shoulders, which\nshowed that he enjoyed it. He may not have walked such long distances as\nHawthorne, or so rapidly as Dickens, but he was a good walker.",
        "His sister, Mrs. Greenleaf, built a memorial chapel in North Cambridge\nfor the Episcopal society there, and from this Longfellow formed the\nhabit of walking in that direction by way of the Botanic Garden.\nSomewhere in the cross streets he became acquainted with two children,\nthe son and daughter of a small shop-keeper. They, of course, told their\nmother about their white-haired acquaintance, and with the fate of\nCharlie Ross before her eyes, their mother warned them to keep out of his\nway. He might be a tramp, and tramps were dangerous!",
        "However, it was not long before the children met their white-haired\nfriend again, and the boy asked him: “Are you a tramp? Mother thinks\nyou’re a tramp, and she wants to know what your name is.” It may be\npresumed that Mr. Longfellow laughed heartily at this misconception, but\nhe said: “I think I may call myself a tramp. I tramp a good deal; but you\nmay tell your mother that my name is Henry W. Longfellow.” He afterwards\ncalled on the mother in order to explain himself, and to congratulate her\non having such fine children.",
        "When the Saturday Club, popularly known as the Atlantic Club, was\norganized, one of the first subjects of discussion that came up was the\nquestion of autographs. Emerson said that was the way in which he\nobtained his postage stamps; but Longfellow confessed that he had given\naway a large number of them. And so it continued to the end. “Why should\nI not do it,” he would say, “if it gives them pleasure?” Emerson looked\non such matters from the stoical point of view as an encouragement to\nvanity; but he would have been more politic to have gratified his\ncurious, or sentimental admirers; for every autograph he gave would have\nmade a purchaser for his publishers.",
        "Harmony did not always prevail in the Saturday Club, for politics was the\nall-embracing subject in those days and its members represented every\nshade of political opinion. Emerson, Longfellow, and Lowell were strongly\nanti-slavery, but they differed in regard to methods. Lowell was what was\nthen called a Seward man, and differed with Emerson in regard to John\nBrown, and with Longfellow in regard to Sumner. Holmes was still more\nconservative; and Agassiz was a McClellan Democrat. William Hunt, the\npainter, believed that the war was caused by the ambition of the leading\npoliticians in the North and South. Longfellow had the advantage of more\ndirect information than the others, and enjoyed the continued successes\nof the Republican party.",
        "In the spring of 1866 a number of Southerners came to Boston to borrow\nfunds in order to rehabilitate their plantations, and were introduced at\nthe Union League Club. Finding themselves there in a congenial element\nthey made speeches strongly tinged with secession doctrines. Sumner, of\ncourse, could not let this pass without making some protest against it,\nand for this he was hissed. The incident was everywhere talked of, and\ncame under discussion at the next meeting of the Saturday Club. Otto\nDresel, a German pianist, who had small reason for being there, said, “It\nwas not Mr. Sumner’s politics but his bad manners that were hissed.\"\nLongfellow set his glass down with emphasis, and replied: “If good\nmanners could not say it, thank heaven bad manners did;” and Lowell\nsupported this with some pretty severe criticism of the Union League\nClub. In justice to the Union League Club, however, it ought to be said\nthat there was applause as well as hisses for Sumner.",
        "Longfellow had a leonine face, but it was that of a very mild lion; one\nthat had never learned the use of teeth and claws. Yet those who knew him\nfelt that he could roar on occasion, if occasion required it. Once at\nLongfellow’s own table the conversation chanced upon Goethe, and a\ngentleman present remarked that Goethe was in the habit of drinking three\nbottles of hock a day. “Who said he did?” inquired the poet. “It is in\nLewes’s biography,” said the gentleman. “I do not believe it,” replied\nLongfellow, “unless,” he added with a laugh, “they were very small\nbottles.” A few days afterwards Prof. William James remarked in regard to\nthis incident that the story was quite incredible.",
        "In his youth Longfellow seems to have taken to guns and fishing-rods more\nregularly than some boys do, but pity for his small victims soon induced\nhim to relinquish the sport. His eldest son, Charles, also took to guns\nvery naturally, and in spite of a severe wound which he received from the\nexplosion of a badly loaded piece, he finally became one of the most\nexpert pigeon-shooters in the State. At the intercession of his father,\nwho considered the game too cruel, he afterwards relinquished this for\ntarget-shooting, in which he succeeded equally well. I was talking one\nday with him on this subject and remarked that I had recently shot two\ncrows with my rifle. “What did you do it for?” interposed his father, in\na deprecatory tone. So I explained to him that crows were outside of the\npale of the law; that they not only were a pest to the farmers but\ndestroyed the eggs and young of singing birds,—in fact, they were bold,\nblack robbers, whose livery betokened their evil deeds. This evidently\ninterested him, and he finally said with a laugh: “If that is the case,\nwe will give you and Charlie a commission to exterminate them.”",
        "There was a story that when young Nicholas Longworth came to Harvard\nCollege in the autumn of 1862 and called on Mr. Longfellow, who had been\nentertained at his father’s house in Cincinnati, the poet said to him:\n\"It is worth that makes the man; the want of it the fellow“\n—a compliment that almost dumfounded his young acquaintance. It is\ncertain that Longfellow addressed a poem to Mrs. Longworth which will be\nfound in the collection of his minor poems, and in which he speaks of her\nas—",
        "In the midst of this unrivalled prosperity, this distinction of genius,\nand public and private honor, on the ninth of July, 1861, there came one\nof the most harrowing tragedies that has ever befallen a man’s domestic\nlife. Longfellow was widowed for the second time, and five children were\nleft without a mother. It seemed as if Providence had set a limit beyond\nwhich human happiness could not pass. It was after this calamity that\nLongfellow undertook his metrical translation of Dante’s “Divina\nCommedia,” a much more difficult and laborious work than writing original\npoetry. As his brother said, “He required an absorbing occupation to\nprevent him from thinking of the past.”",
        "No wonder that in later years he said, in his exquisite verses on the\nMountain of the Holy Cross in Colorado, these pathetic words, “On my\nheart also there is a cross of snow.” In Longfellow’s diary we meet with\nthe names of many books that he read, and these as well as the pertinent\ncomments on them tell much more of his intellectual life than we derive\nfrom his letters. “Adam Bede,” which took the world by storm, did not\nmake so much of an impression on him as Hawthorne’s “Marble Faun,” which\nhe read through in a day and calls a wonderful book. Of “Adam Bede” he\nsays: “It is too feminine for a man; too masculine for a woman.” He says\nof Dickens, after reading “Barnaby Rudge”: “He is always prodigal and\nample, but what a set of vagabonds he contrives to introduce us to!\"\n\"Barnaby Rudge” is certainly the most bohemian and esoteric of Dickens’s\nnovels. He liked much better Miss Muloch’s “John Halifax,\"—a popular\nbook in its time, but not read very much since. He calls Charles Reade a\nclever and amusing writer. We find nothing concerning Disraeli, Trollope,\nor Wilkie Collins. Neither do we hear of critical and historical writers\nlike Ruskin, Matthew Arnold, Carlyle, and Froude. He went, however, to\ncall on Carlyle in England, and was greatly impressed by his\nconversation. The scope of Longfellow’s reading does not compare with\nthat of Emerson or Marian Evans; but the doctors say that “every man of\nforty knows the food that is good for him,” and this is true mentally as\nwell as physically.",
        "He refers more frequently to Tennyson than to any other writer, and\nalways in a generous, cordial manner. Of the “Idyls of the King” he says\nthat the first and third Idyls could only have come from a great poet,\nbut that the second and fourth are not quite equal to the others.",
        "Once, at his sister’s house, he held out a book in his hand and said:\n\"Here is some of the finest dramatic poetry that I have ever read.” It\nwas Tennyson’s “Queen Mary;” but there were many who would not have\nagreed with his estimate of it. Rev. Samuel Longfellow considered the\nstatement very doubtful.",
        "In the summer of 1868 Longfellow went to Europe with his family to see\nwhat Henry James calls “the best of it.” Rev. Samuel Longfellow and T. G.\nAppleton accompanied the party, which, with the addition of Ernest\nLongfellow’s beautiful bride, made a strong impression wherever they were\nseen. In fact their tour was like a triumphal procession.",
        "Longfellow was everywhere treated with the distinction of a famous poet;\nand his fine appearance and dignified bearing increased the reputation\nwhich had already preceded him. His meeting with Tennyson was considered\nas important as the visit of the King of Prussia to Napoleon III., and\nmuch less dangerous to the peace of Europe. It was talked of from\nEdinburgh to Rome.",
        "Longfellow, however, hated lionizing in all its forms, and he avoided\nceremonious receptions as much as possible. He enjoyed the entertainment\nof meeting distinguished people, but he evidently preferred to meet them\nin an unconventional manner, and to have them as much to himself as\npossible. Princes and savants called on him, but he declined every\ninvitation that might tend to give him publicity.",
        "His facility in the different languages was much marvelled at. While he\nwas in Florence a delegation from the mountain towns of Tuscany waited\nupon him and he conversed with them in their own dialect, greatly to\ntheir surprise and satisfaction.",
        "From a number of incidents in this journey, related by Rev. Samuel\nLongfellow, the following has a permanent interest:",
        "When the party came to Verona in May, 1869, they found Ruskin elevated on\na ladder, from which he was examining the sculpture on a monument. As\nsoon as he heard that the Longfellow party was below, he came down and\ngreeted them very cordially. He was glad that they had stopped at Verona,\nwhich was so interesting and so often overlooked; he wanted them to\nobserve the sculptures on the monument,—the softly-flowing draperies\nwhich seemed more as if they had been moulded with hands than cut with a\nchisel. He then spoke in grievous terms of the recent devastation by the\nfloods in Switzerland, which had also caused much damage in the plains of\nLombardy. He thought that reservoirs ought to be constructed on the sides\nof the mountains, which would stay the force of the torrents, and hold\nthe water until it could be made useful. He wished that the Alpine Club\nwould take an interest in the matter. After enjoying so much in\nSwitzerland it would be only fair for them to do something for the\nbenefit of the country. Mr. Appleton then said: “That is a work for\ngovernment to do;” to which Ruskin replied: “Governments do nothing but\nfill their pockets, and issue this,\"—taking out a handful of Italian\npaper currency, which was then much below par.",
        "Everyone has his or her favorite poet or poets, and it is a common\npractice with young critics to disparage one in order to elevate another.\nLongfellow was the most popular American poet of his time, but there were\nothers besides Edgar A. Poe who pretended to disdain him. I have met more\nsuch critics in Cambridge than in England, Germany, or Italy; and the\nreason was chiefly a political one. At a distance Longfellow’s politics\nattracted little attention, but in Cambridge they could not help being\nfelt. In 1862 a strong movement emanated from the Harvard Law-School to\ndefeat Sumner and Andrew, and the lines became drawn pretty sharply. As\nit happened, the prominent conservatives with one or two exceptions all\nlived to the east and north of the college grounds, while Longfellow,\nLowell, Doctor Francis (who baptized Longfellow’s children), Prof. Asa\nGray, and other liberals lived at the west end; and the local division\nmade the contest more acrimonious. The conservatives afterwards felt the\nbitterness of defeat, and it was many years before they recovered from\nthis. A resident graduate of Harvard, who was accustomed to converse on\nsuch subjects as the metaphysics of Hamilton’s quaternions, once said\nthat Longfellow was the paragon of schoolgirls, because he wrote what\nthey would like to so much better than they could. This was contemptible\nenough; but how can one expect a man who discourses on the metaphysics of\nHamilton’s quaternions to appreciate Longfellow’s art, or any art pure\nand simple. “Evangeline,” which is perhaps the finest of Longfellow’s\npoems, is not a favorite with youthful readers.",
        "He was greater as a man, perhaps, than as a poet. Future ages will have\nto determine this; but he was certainly one of the best poets of his\ntime. Professor Hedge, one of our foremost literary critics, spoke of him\nas the one American poet whose verses sing themselves; and with the\nexception of Bryant’s “Robert of Lincoln,” and Poe’s “Raven,” and a few\nother pieces, this may be taken as a judicious statement.",
        "Longfellow’s unconsciousness is charming, even when it seems childlike.\nAs a master of verse he has no English rival since Spenser. The trochaic\nmeter in which “Hiawatha” is written would seem to have been his own\ninvention; [Footnote: At least I can remember no other long poem composed\nin it.] and is a very agreeable change from the perpetual iambics of\nByron and Wordsworth. “Evangeline” is perhaps the most successful\ninstance of Greek and Latin hexameter being grafted on to an English\nstem. Matthew Arnold considered it too dactylic, but the lightness of its\nmovement personifies the grace of the heroine herself. Lines like\nVirgil’s",
        "would not have been suited to the subject.",
        "It has often been said that “Hiawatha” does not represent the red man as\nhe really is, and this is true. Neither does Tennyson represent the\nknights of King Arthur’s court as they were in the sixth century A.D.\nThey are more like modern English gentlemen, and when we read the German\nNeibelungen we recognize this difference. Virgil’s Aeneid does not belong\nto the period of the Trojan war, but this does not prevent the Aeneid\nfrom being very fine poetry. The American Indian is not without his\npoetic side, as is proved by the squaw who knelt down on a flowery\nBrussels carpet, and smoothing it with her hands, said: “Hahnsome!\nhahnsome! heaven no hahnsomer!” There is true poetry in this; and so\nthere is in the Indian cradle-song:",
        "Either of these incidents is sufficient to testify to Longfellow’s\n\"Hiawatha.”",
        "The best poetry is that which forces itself upon our memories, so that it\nbecomes part of our life without the least effort of recollection. Such\nare Emerson’s “Problem,” Whittier’s “Barbara Frietchie,” and Longfellow’s\n\"Santa Filomena.”",
        "Those are fortunate in this life who feel the glad surprise of\nLongfellow.",
        "“Hiawatha” is equally universal in its application to modern life. The\nquestions of the Indian boy and the replies of his nurse, the good\nNikomis, are not confined to the life of the aborigines. Every spirited\nboy is a Hiawatha, and in one form or another goes through the same\nexperiences that Longfellow has represented with such consummate art in\nhis American epic-idyl.",
        "The Lowell family of Boston crossed over from England towards the middle\nof the seventeenth century. One of their number afterwards founded the\ncity of Lowell, by establishing manufactures on the Merrimac River, late\nin the eighteenth century; and in more recent times two members of the\nfamily have held the position of judge in the Supreme Court of\nMassachusetts. They are a family of refined intellectual tastes, as well\nas of good business and professional ability, but of a retiring\ndisposition and not often conspicuous in public life,—a family of\ngeneral good qualities, nicely balanced between liberal and conservative,\nand with a poetic vein running through it for the past hundred years or\nmore. In the Class of 1867 there was an Edward J. Lowell who was chosen\nclass odist, and who wrote poetry nearly, if not quite, as good as that\nof his distinguished relative at the same period of life.",
        "James Russell Lowell was born at Elmwood, as it is now called, on\nWashington’s birthday in 1819,—as if to make a good staunch patriot of\nhim; and, what is even more exceptional in American life, he lived and\ndied in the same house in which he was born. It was not such a house as\nthe Craigie mansion, but still spacious and dignified, and denoted very\nfair prosperity for those times.",
        "Elmwood itself extends for some thirty rods on Brattle Street, but the\nentrance to the house is on a cross-road which runs down to the marshes.\nBeyond Elmwood there is a stonecutter’s establishment, and next to that\nMount Auburn Cemetery, which, however, was a fine piece of woodland in\nLowell’s youth, called Sweet Auburn by the Harvard students, much\nfrequented by love-sick swains and strolling parties of youths and\nmaidens.",
        "The Lowell residence was well into the country at that time. There were\nfew houses near it, and Boston could only be reached by a long detour in\na stage; so that an expedition to the city exhausted the better part of a\nday. It was practically further in the country than Concord is at\npresent; and it was here that Lowell enjoyed that repose of mind which is\nessential to vigorous mental development, and could find such interests\nin external nature as the poet requires for the embellishment of his\nverse.",
        "He went to college at the age of fifteen, two years older than Edward\nEverett, but sufficiently young to prove himself a precocious student.\nCambridge boys of good families have always been noted at Harvard for\ntheir gentlemanly deportment. Besides this, Lowell had an immense fund of\nwit and good spirits, and the two together served to make him very\npopular—perhaps too much so for his immediate good. His father had\ngreat hopes of his promising son,—that he would prove a fine scholar and\ntake a prominent part in the commencement exercises. He even offered the\nboy a reward of two hundred dollars in case this should happen; but the\nattractions of student and social life proved too strong for James. He\nwas quick at languages, but slow in mathematics, and as for Butler’s\nanalogy he cannot be blamed for the aversion with which he regarded it.\nHe writes a letter in which he confesses to peeping over the professor’s\nshoulder to see what marks have been given for his recitations, so that\nhis father’s exhortation would seem at one time to have been seriously\nfelt by him; but the effort did not last long, and we find him repeatedly\nreprimanded for neglect of college duties.",
        "He did not live the life of a roaring blade, but more like the humming-\nbird that darts from one plant to another, and gathers sweetness from\nevery flower in the garden. Finally he was rusticated, just after he had\nbeen elected poet of his class, with directions not to return until\ncommencement. We recognize the Puritanic severity of President Quincy in\nthis sentence, which robbed young Lowell of the pleasantest term of\ncollege life, as well as the honor of appearing on the stage on Class\nDay. That his poem should have been read by another to the assembled\nfamilies of his classmates, served to make his absence more conspicuous.\nNor can we discover any sufficient reason for such hard statement.",
        "At the same age that Longfellow was writing for the United States\nLiterary Gazette, Lowell was scribbling verses for an undergraduates’\nperiodical called Harvardiana. They were not very serious\nproductions, and might all be included under the head of bric-a-brac; but\nthere was a-plenty of them. While Longfellow’s verse at nineteen was\nremarkable for its perfection of form, Lowell’s suffered chiefly from a\nlack of this. He had an idea that poetry ought to be an inspiration of\nthe moment; a good foundation to begin with, but which he found\nafterwards it was necessary to modify.",
        "In the preface to one of his Biglow Papers he speaks of his life in\nConcord as being",
        "The men whom he chiefly associated with there were named Barziliai and\nEbenezer, and the hoar frost of the Concord meadows would seem to have\nhad a chilling effect on Lowell’s naturally tolerant and amiable\ndisposition. He was not attracted by Emerson at this time, but, on the\ncontrary, would seem to have felt an aversion to him. The following lines\nin his class poem could not have referred to anyone else:",
        "To confound the strong spiritual assertion of Emerson with the purely\nnegative attitude of the French satirist was a common mistake in those\ndays, and the Lowell of 1838 needs small excuse for it. He must have been\nin a biting humor at this time, for there is a cut all round in his class\npoem, although it is the most vigorous and highly-finished production of\nhis academic years.",
        "After college came the law, in which he succeeded as well as youthful\nattorneys commonly do; and at the age of twenty-five he entered into the\nholy bonds of matrimony.",
        "The union of James Russell Lowell to Maria White, of Watertown, was the\nmost poetic marriage of the nineteenth century, and can only be compared\nto that of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning. Miss White was herself\na poetess, and full of poetical impulse to the brim. Maria would seem to\nhave been born in the White family as Albinos appear in Africa,—for the\nsake of contrast. She shone like a single star in a cloudy sky,—a pale,\nslender, graceful girl, with eyes, to use Herrick’s expression, “like a\ncrystal glasse.” A child was born where she did not belong, and Lowell\nwas the chivalrous knight who rescued her.",
        "It must have been Maria White who made an Emersonian of him. Margaret\nFuller had stirred up the intellectual life of New England women to a\ndegree never known before or since, and Miss White was one of those who\ncame within the scope of her influence. [Footnote: Lowell himself speaks\nof her as being “considered transcendental.\"] She studied German, and\ntranslated poems from Uhland, who might be called the German Longfellow.\nCertain it is that from the time of their marriage his opinions not only\nchanged from what they had been previously, but his ideas of poetry,\nphilosophy, and religion became more consistent and clearly defined. The\npath that she pointed out to him, or perhaps which they discovered\ntogether, was the one that he followed all through life; so that in one\nof his later poems, he said, half seriously, that he was ready to adopt\nEmerson’s creed if anyone could tell him just what it was.",
        "The life they lived together was a poem in itself, and reminds one of\nGoethe’s saying, that “he who is sufficiently provided for within has\nneed of little from without.” They were poor in worldly goods, but rich\nin affection, in fine thoughts, and courageous endeavor. It is said that\nwhen they were married Lowell had but five hundred dollars of his own.\nThey went to New York and Philadelphia, and soon discovering that they\nhad spent more than half of it, they concluded to return home.",
        "The next ten years of Lowell’s life might be called the making of the\nman. He worked hard and lived economically; earning what he could by the\nlaw, and what he could not by magazine writing, which paid poorly enough.\nPublishers had not then discovered that what the general public desires\nis not literature, but information on current topics, and this is the\nlast thing which the true man of letters is able to provide. A magazine\narticle, or a campaign biography of General Grant, could be written in a\nfew weeks, but a solid historical biography of him, with a critical\nexamination of his campaigns, has not yet been written, and perhaps never\nwill be. A literary venture of Lowell and his friends in 1843, to found a\nfirst-rate literary magazine, proved a failure; and it is to be feared\nthat he lost money by it. [Footnote: See Scudder’s Life of Lowell,\niii. 109.]",
        "However the world might use him he was sure of comfort and happiness at\nhis own fireside, where he read Shelley, and Keats, and Lessing, while\nMrs. Lowell studied upon her German translations. The sympathy of a true-\nhearted woman is always valuable, even when she does not quite understand\nthe grievance in question, but the sympathy that Maria Lowell could give\nher husband was of a rare sort. She could sympathize with him wholly in\nheart and intellect. She encouraged him to fresh endeavors and continual\nimprovement. Thus he went on year by year broadening his mind,\nstrengthening his faculties, and improving his reputation. The days of\nfrolicsome gaiety were over. He now lived in a more serious vein, and\nfelt a deeper, more satisfying happiness. It was much more the ideal life\nof a poet than that of Thoreau, paddling up and down Concord River in\nsearch of the inspiration which only comes when we do not think of it.",
        "It may be suspected that he read more literature than law during these\nyears, and we notice that he did not go, like Emerson, to the great\nfountain-heads of poetry,—to Homer or Dante, Shakespeare or Goethe,—but\ncourted the muse rather among such tributaries as Virgil, Moliere,\nChaucer, Keats, and Lessing. It may have been better for him that he\nbegan in this manner; but a remark that Scudder attributes to him in\nregard to Lessing gives us an insight into the deeper mechanism of his\nmind. “Shelley’s poetry,” he said, “was like the transient radiance of\nSt. Elmo’s fire, but Lessing was wholly a poet.” This is exactly the\nopposite of the view he held during his college life, for Lessing worked\nin a methodical and painstaking manner and finished what he wrote with\nthe greatest care.",
        "More than this, Lessing was as Lowell realized afterwards, too critical\nand polemical to be wholly a poet. His “Emilia Galotti” still holds a\nhigh position on the German stage and has fine poetic qualities, but it\nis written in prose. His “Nathan the Wise” was written in verse, but did\nnot prove a success as a drama. In one he attacked the tyranny of the\nGerman petty princes, and in the other the intolerance of the Established\nChurch. We may assume that is the reason why Lowell admired them; but\nLowell was also too critical and polemic to be wholly a poet,—except on\ncertain occasions. In 1847 he published the “Fable for Critics,” the\nkeenest piece of poetical satire since Byron’s “English Bards and Scotch\nReviewers,\"—keen and even saucy, but perfectly good-humored. About the\nsame time he commenced his “Biglow Papers,” which did not wholly cease\nuntil 1866, and were the most incisive and aggressive anti-slavery\nliterature of that period. Soon afterwards he wrote “The Vision of Sir\nLaunfal,” which has become the most widely known of all his poems, and\nwhich contains passages of the purest a priori verse. Goethe, who\nexercised so powerful an influence on Emerson, does not appear to have\ninterested Lowell at all.",
        "The most plaintive of Beethoven scherzos,—that in the Moonlight Sonata,\n—says as if it were spoken in words:",
        "Lowell’s poetic marriage did not last quite ten years. Maria White was\nalways frail and delicate, and she became more so continually.\nLongfellow’s clear foresight noticed the danger she was in years before\nher death, which took place in the autumn of 1853. She left one child,\nMabel Lowell, slender and pale like herself, and with poetical lines in\nher face, too, but fortunately endowed with her father’s good\nconstitution. Only ten years! But such ten years, worth ten centuries of\nthe life of a girl of fashion, who thinks she is happy because she has\neverything she wants. If the truth were known we might find that in the\ntwilight of his life Lowell thought more of these ten years with Maria\nWhite than of the six years when he was Ambassador to England,—with\ntwenty-nine dinner-parties in the month of June.",
        "What would poets do without war? The Trojan war, or some similar\nconflict, served as the ground-work of Homer’s mighty epic; Virgil\nfollowed in similar lines; Dante would never have been famous but for the\nGuelph and Ghibeline struggle. Shakespeare’s plays are full of war and\nfighting; and the wars of Napoleon stimulated Byron, Schiller, and Goethe\nto the best efforts of their lives. In dealing with men like Emerson,\nLongfellow, and Lowell, who were the intellectual leaders of their time,\nit is impossible to escape their influence in the anti-slavery movement,\nand its influence upon them, unpopular as that subject is at present.\nThat was the heroic age of American history, and the truth concerning it\nhas not yet been written. It was as heroic to the South as to the North,\nfor, as Sumner said, the slaveholders would never have made their\ndesperate attack on the Government of this country if they had not been\nthemselves the slaves of their own social organization.",
        "It was the solution of a great historical problem, like that of\nConstitutional Government versus the Stuarts, and it ought to be\ntreated from a national and not a sectional stand-point.",
        "The live men of that time became abolitionists as inevitably as their\nforefathers became supporters of the Declaration of Independence. If\nWebster and Everett had been born twenty years later, they must needs\nhave become anti-slavery, too. Those of Lowell’s friends, like George S.\nHillard and George B. Loring, who for social or political reasons took\nthe opposite side, afterwards found themselves left in the lurch by an\nadverse public opinion.",
        "It was the Mexican war that first aroused Lowell to the seriousness of\nthe extension of slavery, and it was meeting a recruiting officer in the\nstreets of Boston, “covered all over with brass let alone that which\nnature had set on his countenance,” which inspired his writing the\nfirst of the “Biglow Papers.” They were hastily and carelessly written,\nand Lowell himself held them in slight estimation as literature; but they\nbecame immediately popular, as no poetry had that he had published\npreviously. Their freshness and directness appealed to the manliness and\ngood sense of the average New Englander, and the whole community\nresponded to them with repeated applause. There is, after all, much\npoetry in the Biglow Papers, the more genuine because unintentional; but\nthey are full of the keenest wit and a proverbial philosophy which, if\nless profound than Emerson’s, is more capable of a practical application.",
        "The vernacular in which they are written must have been learned at\nConcord,—perhaps on the front stoop of the Middlesex Hotel,—while\nLowell was listening to the pithy conversation of Yankee farmers, not\nonly about their crops and cattle, but also discussing church affairs and\npolitics, local and national. It was the grandfathers of these men who\ndrove the British back from Concord bridge, and it was their sons who\nfought their way from the Rapidan to Richmond. With the help of country\nlawyers they sent Sumner and Wilson to the Senate, and knew what they\nwere about when they did this. For wit, humor, and repartee,—and, it may\nbe added, for decent conversation,—there is no class of men like them.\nBoth Lowell and Emerson have testified to their intrinsic worth.",
        "On one occasion a Concord farmer was driving a cow past Sanborn’s school-\nhouse, when an impudent boy called out, “The calf always follows the\ncow.” “Why aren’t you behind here, then?” retorted the man, with a look\nthat went home like the stroke of a cane. If Lowell had been present he\nwould have been delighted.",
        "The Yankee dialect which he makes use of as a vehicle in these verses is\nnot always as clear-cut as it might be. He says, for instance,",
        "The true New England countryman never flattens a vowel; if he changes it\nhe always makes it sharp. He would be more likely to say: “Pleasure does\nmake us Yankee kind er winch, as if ’twas suthin’ paid for by the inch.\"\nThere are other instances of similar sort; but, nevertheless, if the\nprimitive Yankee should become extinct, as now seems very probable,\nLowell’s masterly portrait of him will remain, and future generations can\nreconstruct him from it, as Agassiz reconstructed an extinct species of\nmammal from fossil bones.",
        "Lowell did not join the Free-soilers, who were now bearing the brunt of\nthe anti-slavery conflict, but attached himself to the more aristocratic\nwing of the old abolitionists, which was led by Edmund Quincy, Maria\nChapman, and L. Maria Child. Lowell was far from being a non-resistant.\nIn fact, he might be called a fighting-man, although he disapproved of\nduelling; and this served to keep him at a distance from Garrison, of\nwhom he wisely remarked that “the nearer public opinion approached to him\nthe further he retreated into the isolation of his own private opinions.\"\nHe wrote regularly for the Anti-Slavery Standard until 1851, when\nthe death of his father-in-law supplied the long-desired means for a\njourney to Italy,—more desired perhaps for his wife’s health than for\nhis own gratification. It may be the fault of his biographers, but I\ncannot discover that Lowell took any share in the opposition to the\nFugitive Slave bill, or in the election of Sumner, which was the signal\nevent that followed it. In his whole life Lowell never made the\nacquaintance of a practical statesman, while Whittier was in constant\ncommunication with prominent members of the Free-soil and Republican\nparties. Sumner went to hear Lowell’s lecture on Milton, and praised it\nas a work of genius.",
        "I have heard the “Vision of Sir Launfal” spoken of more frequently than\nany other of Lowell’s poems. Some of the descriptive passages in it would\nseem to have flowed from his pen as readily as ink from a quill; and\nthere are others which appear to have been evolved with much thought and\ningenuity. One cannot help feeling the sudden change from a June morning\nat Elmwood to a mediaeval castle in Europe as somewhat abrupt; but when\nwe think of it subjectively as a poetic vision which came to Lowell\nhimself seated on his own door-step, this disillusion vanishes, and we\nsympathize heartily with the writer. There is no place in the world where\nJune seems so beautiful as in New England, on account of the dismal,\ncutthroat weather in the months that precede it. Perhaps it is so in\nreality; for what nature makes us suffer from at one time she commonly\natones for it another.",
        "The “Fable for Critics” is written in an easy, nonchalant manner, which\nhelps to mitigate its severity. Thoreau could not have liked very well\nbeing called an imitator of Emerson; but the wit of it is inimitable. “T.\nnever purloins the apples from Emerson’s trees; it is only the windfalls\nthat he carries off and passes for his own fruit.” Emerson remarked on\nthis, that Thoreau was sufficiently original in his own way; and he\nalways spoke of Lowell in a friendly and appreciative manner. The whole\npoem is filled with such homely comparisons, which hit the nail exactly\non the head. The most subtle piece of analysis, however, is Lowell’s\ncomparison between Emerson and Carlyle:",
        "It was the fashion in England at that time to disparage Emerson as an\nimitator of Carlyle; and this was Lowell’s reply to it.",
        "He told Professor Hedge an amusing incident that happened during his\nfirst visit to Rome. Lowell and his wife took lodgings with a respectable\nelderly Italian woman whose husband was in a sickly condition. One\nmorning she met him in the passageway with tearful eyes and said: “Un\ngran’ disgrazie happened last night,—my poor husband went to\nheaven.” Lowell wondered why there was a pope in Rome if going to heaven\nwas considered a disgrace there.",
        "Longfellow’s resignation of his professorship at Harvard was a rare piece\nof good fortune for Lowell; for it was the only position of the kind that\nhe could have obtained there or anywhere else. In fact, it was a question\nwhether the appointment would be confirmed on account of his\ntranscendental tendencies, and his connection with the Anti-slavery\nStandard; but Longfellow threw the whole weight of his influence in\nLowell’s favor, and this would seem to have decided it. From this time\ntill 1873 Lowell was more of a prose-writer than a poet, and his essays\non Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, and other English poets are the best of\ntheir kind,—not brilliant, but appreciative, penetrating, and well-\nconsidered. Wasson said of him that no other critic in the English tongue\ncame so near to expressing the inexpressible as Lowell.",
        "One could wish that his studies in Shakespeare had been more extended. He\ntreats the subject as if he felt it was too great for him; but he was the\nfirst to take notice that the play of Richard III. indicated in its\nmain extent a different hand, and it is now generally admitted to have\nbeen the work of Fletcher. With the keenest insight he noticed that the\nmagician Prospero was an impersonation of Shakespeare himself; and George\nBrandes, the most thoroughgoing of Shakespearean scholars, afterwards\ncame to the same conclusion.",
        "Lowell was the gentlemanly instructor. He appealed to the gentleman in\nthe students who sat before him, and he rarely appealed in vain. Like\nLongfellow he carried an atmosphere of politeness about him, which was\nsufficient to protect him from everything rude and common. He would say\nto his class in Italian: “I shall not mark you if you are tardy, but I\nhope you will all be here on time.” This was a safer procedure with a\nsmall division of Juniors than it would have been with a large division\nof Freshmen or Sophomores. Neither did he take much personal interest in\nhis classes. He always invited them to an entertainment at Elmwood in\nJune, but two or three years later he could not remember their faces\nunless they remained in or about Cambridge. In regard to his efficiency\nas an instructor and lecturer there was a difference of opinion.",
        "He attended the meetings of the college faculty quite regularly\nconsidering the distance of Elmwood from the college grounds; and he was\nonce heard to say that there seemed to be more bad weather on Monday\nnights than at any other time in the week. His presence might have been\ndispensed with for the most part. He rarely spoke in conclave, and when\nthe question came up in regard to the suspension of students he often\ndeclined to vote. His decorum was perfect, but now and then a humorous\nlook could be observed in his eyes, and it may be suspected that he had a\nquiet laugh all to himself on the way homeward. On one occasion, before\nthe meeting had been called to order, Professor Cutler said to him: “Do\nyou not dread B.’s forthcoming translation of the Iliad?” But Lowell,\nseeing that he was watched, replied: “Oh, no, not at all,” at the same\ntime nodding to Cutler with his brows.",
        "He was always well-dressed, and pretty close to the conventional in his\nways,—noted specially for the nicety of his gloves. This was a kind of\nsafeguard to him. Insidious persons suggested that he perfumed his beard,\nbut I do not believe it. He does not appear to have been fond of walking,\nfor we never met him in any part of Cambridge except on the direct road\nfrom Elmwood to the college gate. He had a characteristic gait of his\nown—walking slowly in rather a dreamy manner, and keeping time to the\nmovement of his feet with his arms and shoulders. He was not, however,\nlost in contemplation, for he often scrutinized those who passed him as\nclosely as a portrait painter might.",
        "If one could meet Lowell in a fairly empty horse-car, he would be quite\nsociable and entertaining; but if the horse-car filled up, he would\nbecome reticent again. He clung to his old friends, his classmates, and\nothers with whom he had grown up, and did not easily make new ones. The\nmodesty of his ambition is conspicuous in the fact that he was quite\nsatisfied with the small salary paid him by the college,—at first only\ntwelve hundred dollars. He evidently did not care for luxury.",
        "Lowell’s second marriage was as simple and inevitable as the first. Miss\nDunlap was not an ordinary housekeeper, but the sister of one of Maria\nLowell’s most intimate friends, and she was such a pleasant, attractive\nlady that the wonder is rather he should have waited four years before\nconcluding to offer himself. She was compared to the Greek bust called\nClyte, because her hair grew so low down upon her forehead, and this was\nconsidered an additional charm.",
        "Louisa Alcott had a story that at first she refused Lowell’s offer on\naccount of what people might say; and that then he composed a poem\nanswering her objections in the form of an allegory, and that this\nfinally convinced her. If he had considered material interests he would\nhave married differently.",
        "In November, 1857, the firm of Phillips & Sampson issued the first number\nof the Atlantic Monthly in the cause of high-minded literature,—a\ncause which ultimately proved to be their ruin. Lowell accepted the\nposition of editor, and such a periodical as it proved to be under his\nguidance could not have been found in England, and perhaps not in the\nwhole of Europe; but it could not be made to pay, and two years later\nPhillips & Sampson failed,—partly on that account, and partially the\nvictims of a piratical opposition.",
        "Lowell published Emerson’s “Brahma” in spite of the shallow ridicule with\nwhich he foresaw it would be greeted; but when Emerson sent him his “Song\nof Nature” he returned it on account of the single stanza:",
        "which he declared was more than the Atlantic could be held\nresponsible for. Emerson, who really knew little as to what the public\nthought of him, was for once indignant. He said: “I did not know who had\nconstituted Mr. Lowell my censor, and I carried the verses to Miss\nCaroline Hoar, who read them and said, that she considered those four\nlines the best in the piece.” He permitted Lowell, however, to publish\nthe poem without them, as may be seen by examining the pages of the\nAtlantic, and afterwards published the original copy in his “May\nDay.”",
        "Lowell’s editorship of the North American Review, which followed\nafter this, was not so successful. It was chiefly a political magazine at\nthat time, and to understand politics in a large way—that is,\nsufficiently to write on the subject—one must not only be a close\nobserver of public affairs, but also a profound student of history; and\nLowell was neither. He was not acquainted with prominent men in public\nlife, and depended too much on information derived at dinner-parties, or\nsimilar occasions. During the war period Sumner, Wilson, and Andrew were\nalmost omnipotent in Massachusetts, for the three worked together in a\ncommon cause; but power always engenders envy and so an inside opposition\ngrew up within the Republican party to which Lowell lent his assistance\nwithout being aware of its true character. His articles in the North\nAmerican on public affairs were severely criticised by Andrew and\nWilson, while Frank W. Bird frankly called them “giving aid and comfort\nto the enemy.” It was certainly a doubtful course to pursue at such a\ncritical juncture—when all patriots should have been united—and it\noffended a good many Republicans without conciliating the opposition.\nLowell’s successor in this editorial chair was an old Webster Whig who\nhad become a Democrat.",
        "In 1873 he resigned his professorship and went to Italy for a holiday. He\nsaid to some friends whom he met in Florence: “I am tired of being called\nProfessor Lowell, and I want to be plain Mr. Lowell again. Eliot wanted\nto keep my name on the catalogue for the honor of the university, but I\ndid not like the idea.” This was true republicanism and worthy of a poet.",
        "Lowell was little known on the continent, and he travelled in a quiet,\nunostentatious manner. He went to dine with his old friends, but avoided\nintroductions, and remained at Florence nearly two months after other\nAmericans had departed for Rome. The reason he alleged for this was that\nRome was a mouldy place and the ruins made him feel melancholy; also,\nbecause he preferred oil paintings to frescos. He had just come from\nVenice, and spoke with enthusiasm of the mighty works of Tintoretto,—\nespecially his small painting of the Visitation, above the landing of the\nstaircase in the Scuola of San Rocco. He did not like the easel-paintings\nof Raphael on account of their hard outlines; those in the Vatican did\nhim better justice. This idea he may have derived from William Morris\nHunt, the Boston portrait-painter. He considered the action of the Niobe\ngroup too strenuous to be represented in marble.",
        "Miss Mary Felton liked the Niobe statues; so Lowell said, “Now come back\nwith me, and I will sit on you.” Accordingly we all returned to the Niobe\nhall, where Lowell lectured us on the statues without, however, entirely\nconvincing Miss Felton. Then we went to the hall in the Uffizi Palace,\nwhich is called the Tribune. Mrs. Lowell had never been in the\nTribune, where the Venus de’ Medici is enshrined; so her husband\nopened the door wide and said, “Now go in\"—as if he were opening the\ngates of Paradise.",
        "At Bologna he wished to make an excursion into the mountains, but the\n100 veturino charged about twice the usual price, and though the man\nafterwards reduced his demand to a reasonable figure Lowell would not go\nwith him at all, and told him that such practices made Americans dislike\nthe Italian people. It is to be feared that a strange Italian might fare\njust as badly in America.",
        "Readers of Lowell’s “Fireside Travels” will have noticed that the first\nof them is addressed to the “Edelmann Storg” in Rome. The true translation\nof this expression is “Nobleman Story;” that is, William W. Story,\nthe sculptor, who modelled the statue of Edward Everett in the Boston\npublic garden. Lowell’s biographer, however, does not appear to have\nbeen aware of the full significance of this paraphrase of Story’s name.",
        "When King Bomba II. was expelled from Naples by Garibaldi he retired to\nRome with his private possessions, including a large number of oil\npaintings. Wishing to dispose of some of these, and being aware that\nAmericans paid good prices, he applied to William Story to transact the\nbusiness for him. This the sculptor did in a satisfactory manner;\nwhereupon King Bomba, instead of rewarding Story with a cheque, conferred\non him a patent of nobility. It seems equally strange that Story should\nhave accepted such a dubious honor, and that Lowell should recognize it.",
        "On his return to Cambridge the following year, Lowell found himself a\ngrandfather, his daughter having married a gentleman farmer in Worcester\ncounty. He was greatly delighted, and wrote to E. L. Godkin, editor of\nThe Nation:",
        "“If you wish to taste the real bouquet of life, I advise you to procure\nyourself a grandson, whether by adoption or theft.... Get one, and the\nNation will no longer offend anybody.” [Footnote: Scudder’s\nbiography, ii., 186.]",
        "This was a pretty broad hint, but E. L. Godkin was not the man to pay\nmuch attention to the advice of Lowell or anybody. In fact, he seems to\nhave won Lowell over after this to his own way of thinking.",
        "Lowell certainly became more conservative with age. He did not support\nthe movement for negro citizenship, and had separated himself in a manner\nfrom the other New England poets. After 1872 Longfellow saw little of\nhim, except on state occasions. In 1876 he made a political address that\nshowed that if he had not already gone over to the Democratic party he\nwas very close upon the line. Charles Francis Adams had already gone over\nto Tilden, and had carried the North American Review with him. It\nwould not do to lose Lowell also, so the Republican leaders hit upon the\nshrewd device of nominating him as a presidential elector, an honor which\nhe could not very well decline. When the disputed election of Hayes and\nTilden came, Godkin proposed that, in order to prevent “Mexicanizing the\ngovernment,” one of the Hayes electors should cast his vote for General\nBristow, which would throw the election of President into the House of\nRepresentatives; and he endeavored to persuade Lowell to do this. Lowell\nwent so far as to take legal advice on the subject, but his counsellor\ninformed him that since the election of John Quincy Adams it had been\nvirtually decided that an elector must cast his vote according to the\nticket on which he was chosen. When the electors met at the Parker House\nin January, 1877, Lowell deposited his ballot for Hayes and Wheeler, and\nthe slight applause that followed showed that his colleagues were\nconscious of the position he had assumed.",
        "When President Hayes appointed Lowell to be Minister to Spain, Lowell\nremarked that he did not see why it should have come to him. It really\ncame to him through his friend E. E. Hoar, of Concord, who was brother-\nin-law to Secretary Evarts. His friends wondered that he should accept\nthe position, but the truth was that Lowell at this time was\ncomparatively poor. His taxes had increased, and his income had\ndiminished. He complained to C. P. Cranch that the whole profit from the\nsale of his books during the preceding year was less than a hundred\ndollars, and he thought there ought to be a law for the protection of\nauthors. The real trouble was hard times.",
        "He did not like Madrid, and at the end of a year wrote that it seemed\nimpossible for him to endure the life there any longer. Evarts gave him a\nvacation, and at the end of the second year Hayes promoted him to the\nCourt of St. James.",
        "Such an appointment would have been dangerous enough in 1861, but at the\ntime it was made the relations between the United States and Great\nBritain were sufficiently peaceable to warrant it. Lowell represented his\ncountry in a highly creditable manner. The only difficulty he experienced\nwas with the Fenian agitation, and he managed that with such diplomatic\ntact that no one has yet been able to discover whether he was in favor of\nhome rule for Ireland or not.",
        "He made a number of excellent addresses in England, besides a multitude\nof after-dinner speeches. Perhaps the best of them was his address at the\nColeridge celebration, in which he levelled an attack on the English\ncanonization of what they call “common sense,” but which is really a new\nname for dogmatism. Lowell, if not a transcendentalist, was always an\nidealist, and he knew that ideality was as necessary to Cromwell and\nCanning as it was to Shakespeare and Scott.",
        "He was certainly more popular in England than he had ever been in\nAmerica, and he openly admitted that he disliked to resign his position.\nProfessor Child said, in 1882: “Lowell’s conversation is witty, with a\nbasis of literary cramming; and that seems to be what the English like.\nHe went to twenty-nine dinner parties in the month of June, and made a\nspeech at each one of them.”",
        "In the last years of his life he was greatly infested with imitators who,\nas he said of Emerson in the “Fable for Critics,” stole his fruit and\nthen brought it back to him on their own dishes. Some of them were too\ninfluential to be easily disposed of, and others did not know when they\nwere rebuffed. An old man, failing in strength and vigor, he had to\nendure them as best he could.",
        "The story of Lowell’s visions rests on a single authority, and if there\nwas any truth in it, it seems probable that he would have confided the\nfact to more intimate friends. There are well-authenticated instances of\nvisions seen by persons in a waking condition—this always happens, for\ninstance, in delirium tremens—but they are sure to indicate\nnervous derangement, and are commonly followed by death. If there was\never a poet with a sound mind and a sound body, it was James Russell\nLowell.",
        "Edwin Arnold considered him the best of American poets, while Matthew\nArnold did not like him at all. Emerson, in his last years, preferred him\nto Longfellow, but it is doubtful if he always did so. The strong point\nof his poetry is its intelligent manliness,—the absence of affectation\nand all sentimentality; but it lacks the musical element. He composed\nneither songs nor ballads,—nothing to match Hiawatha, or Gray’s famous\nElegy. America still awaits a poet who shall combine the savoir\nfaire of Lowell with the force of Emerson and the grace and purity of\nLongfellow.",
        "Emerson had an advantage over his literary contemporaries in the vigorous\nlife he lived. You feel in his writing the energy of necessity. The\nacademic shade is not favorable to the cultivation of genius, and Lowell\nreclined under it too much. His best work was already performed before he\nbecame a professor. What he lacks as a poet, however, he compensates for\nas a wit. He is the best of American humorists—there are few who will be\ninclined to dispute that—even though we regret occasional cynicisms,\nlike his jest on Milton’s blindness in “Fireside Travels.”",
        "Christopher Pearce Cranch was born March 9, 1813, at Alexandria,\nVirginia, and was the son of Judge William Cranch, of the United States\nCircuit Court. His father came originally from Weymouth, Massachusetts,\nand had been appointed to his position through the influence of John\nQuincy Adams. His mother, Anna Greenleaf, belonged to a well known Boston\nfamily. Pearce, as he was always called by his relatives, indicated a\ntalent for the fine arts, as commonly happens, at an early age, and\nunited with this a lively interest in music, singing and playing on the\nflute. These side issues may have prevented him from entering college so\nearly as he might otherwise have done. He graduated at Columbia College,\nin 1832, after a three-year course. He wished to make a profession of\npainting, but Judge Cranch was aware how precarious this would be as a\nmeans of livelihood, and advised him to study for the ministry,—for\nwhich his quiet ways and grave demeanor seemed to have adapted him. He\naccordingly entered the Harvard Divinity-School, and was ordained as a\nUnitarian clergyman.",
        "For the next six years Cranch lived the life of an itinerant preacher. He\npreached all over New England, making friends everywhere, and receiving\nnumerous calls without, however, settling down to a fixed habitation.\nThis would seem to have been a peculiarity of his temperament; for\nin 1875 George William Curtis wrote to Mr. and Mrs. Cranch a letter which\nbegan with “O ye Bedouins\"; and it is true that until that time he can\nhardly be said to have had a habitation of his own. He extended his\nmigration as minister-at-large from Bangor, Maine, to Louisville,\nKentucky. His varied accomplishments made him attractive to the younger\nmembers of the parishes for which he preached, but he never remained long\nenough in one place for their interest to take root.",
        "The wave of German thought and literary interest was now sweeping over\nEngland and America. Repelled by doctors of divinity and the older class\nof scholars, it was seized upon with avidity by the more susceptible\nnatures of the younger generation. Its influence was destined to be felt\nall through the coming period of American literature. C. P. Cranch was\naffected by it, as Emerson, Longfellow and even Hawthorne, were affected\nby it. This, however, did not take place at once, and when Emerson’s\n\"Nature” was published, Cranch was at first repelled by the peculiarity\nof its style. At the house of Rev. James Freeman Clark, in Cincinnati, he\ndrew some innocently satirical illustrations of it. One was of a man with\nan enormous eye under which he wrote: “I became one great transparent\neye-ball\"; and another was a pumpkin with a human face, beneath which was\nwritten: “We expand and grow in the sunshine.” In another sketch Emerson\nand Margaret Fuller were represented driving “over hill and dale” in a\nrockaway.",
        "[Footnote: Sanborn’s Life of Alcott.]",
        "He would make these humorous sketches to entertain his friends at any\ntime, seizing on a half-sheet of paper, or whatever might be at hand; but\nhe did not long continue to caricature Emerson. His first volume of\npoetry, published in 1844, was dedicated to Emerson, and in Dwight’s\n\"Translations from Goethe and Schiller,” there are a number of short\npieces by Cranch, almost perfect in their rendering from German to\nEnglish. Among these the celebrated ballad of “The Fisher” is translated\nso beautifully as to be slightly, if at all, inferior to the original.\nThe stanza,",
        "may have appealed strongly to Cranch at this time; for we find that in\nOctober, 1841, he was married at Fishkill-on-the-Hudson to a young lady\nof an old Knickerbocker family, Miss Elizabeth De Windt. If she did not\ncome to him out of the Hudson, there can be no doubt that he courted her\nby the banks of the most beautiful river in North America.",
        "Cranch had given up the clerical profession six months before this, and\nhad adopted that of a landscape painter, for which he would seem to have\nstudied with some artist in New York City,—unknown to fame, and long\nsince forgotten. He continued to sketch and paint, and write prose and\nverse on the Hudson until 1846, when he embarked with his wife on a\nsailing packet for Marseilles. He had the good fortune to find a fellow-\npassenger in George William Curtis, and during the voyage of seven weeks,\na lifelong friendship grew up between these two highly gifted men.",
        "The volume of poems which he published in 1844 is now exceedingly rare;\nyet many of the pieces belong to a high order of excellence. In ease and\ngrace of versification they resemble Longfellow, but in thought they are\nmore like Emerson or Goethe. Consider this opening from “The Riddle”:",
        "This is sonorous. It has a majesty of expression and a greatness of\nthought which makes Longfellow’s “Psalm of Life” seem weak and even\ncommon-place. The whole poem is pitched in the same key, and Cranch never\nequalled it again, excepting once, and then in a very different manner.\nRev. Gideon Arch, a Hungarian scholar, philologist, and exile of 1849,\nsaid of his “Endymion” that there were Endymions in all languages, but\nthat Cranch’s was the best. To resuscitate it from the oblivion into\nwhich it has fallen, it is given entire:",
        "This has the very sheen of moonlight upon it, and certainly is to be\npreferred to Dr. Johnson’s scholastic “Endymion”:",
        "If Cranch had continued in this line, and perhaps have improved upon it,\nhe would surely have become one of the foremost American poets, but a\npoet cannot live by verse alone, and after he began to be thoroughly in\nearnest with his painting, his rhythmic genius fell into the background.\nFrom Marseilles George W. Curtis proceeded to Egypt, where he wrote his\nwell known book of Nile travels, while Cranch set out for Rome to perfect\nhis art.",
        "He studied there at a night-school, painting in water colors from nude\nmodels and arrangements of drapery, but not taking lessons from any\nregular instructor. He never applied himself much to figure-painting,\nhowever. He sold his paintings chiefly to American travellers, and when\nthe Revolution broke out in 1848, he returned to Sorrento, where his\nsecond child, Mrs. Leonora Scott, was born. His first child was born the\nyear previous, in Rome, but afterwards died. In 1851, he returned to New\nYork and Fishkill, but not meeting with such good appreciation there as\nhe had in Italy, he went to Europe again in the autumn of 1853, and\nresided in Paris. One cause of this may have been the unfriendliness of\nhis brother-in-law, who was a leading art critic in New York City, and\nwho disliked Cranch on account of his wife, and never neglected an\nopportunity of disparaging his work.",
        "One of his early landscapes is now before me. I think it must have been\npainted anterior to his sojourn in Rome, owing to the coldness of the\ncoloring. It represents a scene on the Hudson near Fishkill, with some\ncattle in the foreground, and a rather bold-looking mountain on the\nopposite side of the river. The clouds above the mountain are light and\nfleecy; the foliage soft and graceful; the cattle also are fine, but the\neffect is like a chilly spring day when one requires a winter overcoat.\nAn allegorical piece, illustrating Heine’s fir-tree dreaming of the palm,\nhas a much pleasanter effect, although it represents a wintry scene.",
        "His art improved greatly in Paris, and he also wrote a number of short\npoems which his friend, James Russell Lowell, published in the\nAtlantic Monthly. In 1856 George L. Stearns sent him an order for\na painting, which Cranch executed the following year, and wrote Mr.\nStearns this explanation concerning it, in a very interesting letter\ndated Paris, March 18, 1857:",
        "“Your picture is done and is quite a favorite with those who have seen\nit. In fact, I think so well of it that I shall probably send it to the\nExposition, which opens soon. After that it shall be sent to you. It is\nan oak and a sunset—a warm and low-toned picture—and I am sure you\nwill like it.”",
        "This landscape represents two vigorous oak trees by the bank of a river,\nwith a sunset seen through the branches, and reflected in the water. The\nscene is remarkably like a similar one on Concord River, about two\nhundred yards below the spot where Hawthorne and Channing discovered the\nbody of the schoolmistress who drowned herself, as Hawthorne supposed,\nfrom lack of sympathy. It seems as if the original sketch must have been\nmade at that point. It is of a deep rich coloring, smoothly and\ndelicately finished,—a painting that no one has yet been able to find\nfault with. Rev. Samuel Longfellow, who knew almost every picture in the\ngalleries of Europe, considered it equal to a Ruysdael, and he liked it\nbetter than a Ruysdael.",
        "In the letter above referred to Cranch also writes:",
        "“Since your letter (a long time ago) I have written you a good many\nepistles (in a kind of invisible ink of my invention) which probably you\nhave never received.",
        "“The truth is, I am a distinguished case of total depravity in the matter\nof correspondence. Letters ought to flow from one as easily and\nspontaneously as spoken words. But then one must write all the time and\nreport life continuously, as one does in speech. A letter does nothing\nbut give some little detached morsel of one’s life—and we say to\nourselves what is the use of holding up to a friend three thousand miles\noff such unsatisfactory statements, such dribblings and droppings? ’Write\nwhat is uppermost,’ says one at your elbow. Ah, if we could only say what\nis uppermost; as I sit down for instance to write (say this letter) I am\ncaught into a sort of whirl of thoughts, in which it is impossible to say\nexactly what is foremost and what is hindmost. Then if I only attempt to\nnarrate events, where am I to begin—so you see (I am theorizing about\nletters) a letter must be a sort of epitome of a friend’s being and life\nor else nothing. Applying the theory to myself, finding myself unable to\nshut my genie in a box and carry him on my shoulders, I simply go and\nstate that there is such a box with a genie supposed to be in it, lying\nat the custom-house, and here is the roughest sort of sketch of it,” etc.",
        "This is characteristic of the man. He lived largely in an atmosphere of\npoetic pleasantry, which served as an alleviation to his cares and as an\nattraction to his friends.",
        "Cranch did not always succeed so well. He never became a mannerist, but\nthere was too much similarity in his subjects, and the treatment too\noften bordered on the commonplace. Tintoretto said: “Colors can be bought\nat the paint-shop, but good designs are only obtained by sleepless nights\nand much reflection.” It is doubtful if Cranch ever laid awake over his\nwork, either in poetry or painting. He had a dreamy, phlegmatic\ndisposition, which seemed to carry him through life without much effort\nof the will. He once confessed that when he was a boy he would never fire\na gun for fear it might kick him over, and when he was at Hampton beach\nin 1875 he was in the habit of going out to sketch at a certain hour with\nprosaic regularity. He did not seem to be on the watch, as an artist\nshould, for rare effects of light and scenery, and he talked of art with\nvery little enthusiasm. Yet he lived the true life of his profession,\nenjoying his work, contented with little praise, and without envy of\nthose who were more fortunate. What is called odium artisticum was\nunknown to him.",
        "He was an unpretending, courteous American gentleman. His disposition was\nperfect, and no one could remember having seen him out of temper. His\npleasant flow of wit and humor, together with his varied accomplishments,\nmade him a very brilliant man in society, and he counted among his\nfriends the finest literati in Rome, London, and the United\nStates. He knew Thackeray as he knew Curtis and Lowell, and was once\ndining with him in a London chop-house, when Thackeray said: “Have you\nread the last number of The Newcombs?—if not, I will read it to you.\"\nAccordingly he gave the waiter a shilling to obtain the document, and\nread it aloud to Cranch and a friend who was with him.",
        "[Footnote: Both mentioned in Hawthorne’s Notebook.]",
        "Cranch could never understand this, for it was the last thing he would\nhave done himself without an invitation; but he enjoyed the reading, and\noften referred to it.",
        "When he returned to America in 1863 he went to live on Staten Island in\norder to be near George William Curtis, who cared for him as Damon did\nfor Pythias, and who served to counteract the ill-omened influence of\nCranch’s brother-in-law. The Century Club purchased one of his pictures,\nan allegorical subject, which I believe still hangs in their halls. From\n1873 to 1877 Lowell would seem to have frequented Cranch’s house in\npreference to any other in Cambridge.",
        "When Cranch first went to live there he occupied a small but sunny and\notherwise desirable house on the westerly side of Appian Way,—a name\nthat amused him mightily,—but in 1876 he purchased the house on the\nsouthwestern corner of Ellery and Harvard Streets. Having arranged his\nhousehold goods there he sent one of his own paintings as a present to\nEmerson in order to renew their early acquaintance. Emerson responded to\nit by a characteristic note, in which he said that his son and daughter,\nwho were both good artists, had expressed their approval of his present.\nHe then referred to the danger which arises from a multiplicity of\ntalents, and said: “I well recollect how you made the frogs vocal in the\nponds back of Sleepy Hollow.”",
        "Cranch did not feel that this was very complimentary, but a few days\nlater there came an invitation for Mr. and Mrs. Cranch to spend the day\nat Concord. Emerson met them at the railway station with his carryall. He\nhad on an old cylinder hat which had evidently seen good service, and yet\nbecame him remarkably. He was interested to hear what George William\nCurtis thought about politics, and to find that it agreed closely with\nthe opinion of his friend, Judge Hoar. The Cranchs had a delightful\nvisit.",
        "Cranch’s baritone voice was like his poem, the “Riddle,” deep, rich and\nsonorous. He might have earned a larger income with it, perhaps, than he\ndid by writing and painting. He sang comic songs in a manner peculiarly\nhis own,—as if the words were enclosed in a parenthesis,—as much as to\nsay, “I do not approve of this, but I sing it just the same,” and this\nmade the performance all the more amusing. He sang Bret Harte’s “Jim” in\na very effective manner, and he often sang the epitaph on Shakespeare’s\ntomb,",
        "as a recitative, both in English and Italian,—In questa tomba.\nHe seemed to bring out a hidden force in his singing, which was not\napparent on ordinary occasions. His reading of poetry was also fine, but\nhe depended in it rather too much on his voice, too little on the meaning\nof the verse. It was not equal to Celia Thaxter’s reading.",
        "The same types of physiognomy continually reappear among artists. William\nM. Hunt looked like Horace Vernet, and Cranch in his old age resembled\nthe Louvre portrait of Tintoretto, although his features were not so\nstrong. He used to say in jest that he was descended from Lucas Cranach,\nbut that the second vowel had dropped out. He cared as little for the\nfashions as poets and artists commonly do, but there was no dandy in\nBoston who appeared so well in a full dress suit.",
        "In 1873 the Velasquez method of painting was in full vogue at Boston.\nCranch did not believe in imitations, or in adopting the latest style\nfrom Paris, and he set himself against the popular hue-and-cry somewhat\nto his personal disadvantage. Charles Perkins and the other art scholars\nwho founded the Art Museum in Copley Square were all on Cranch’s side,\nbut that did not seem to help him with the public. “They cannot bend the\nbow of Ulysses,” said Cranch in some disgust. He preferred Murillo to\nVelasquez, and once had quite an argument with William Hunt on the\nsubject in Doll & Richards’s picture-store. Hunt asserted that there was\nno essential difference between a sketch and a finished picture,—he\nmight have said there was no difference between a boy and a man,—that\nall the artist needed was to express himself, and that it was immaterial\nin what way he did so. Cranch thought afterwards, though unfortunately it\ndid not occur to him at the moment, that the test of such a theory would\nbe its application to sculpture. He wondered what Raphael would have\nthought of it.",
        "It was quite a grief to Cranch that his own daughter, who inherited his\ntalent, should have deserted him at this juncture, and gone over to the\nopposition. She filled his house with rough, heavily-shaded studies of\nstill-life, flowers, and faces of her friends; but of all Hunt’s pupils,\nMiss Cranch, Miss Knowlton, and Miss Lamb were the only ones who achieved\nartistic distinction in their special work.",
        "It was in order to withdraw her from this Walpurgis art-dance that Cranch\nundertook his last journey to Paris in his seventieth year. There the\nyoung lady quickly dropped her Boston method, and, acquiring a more\nconservative handling, became an excellent portrait painter; too soon,\nhowever, obliged to relinquish her art on account of ill-health.",
        "Cranch’s landscapes now adorn the walls of private houses; very largely\nthe houses of his numerous friends. He did not paint in the fashion of\nthe time, but like Millet followed a fashion of his own; and I do not\nknow of any of his pictures in public collections, although there are\nmany that deserve the honor. The best landscape of his that I have seen\nwas painted just before his last visit to Paris. It represents a low-\ntoned sunset like the “Two Oaks\"; an autumnal scene on a narrow river,\nwith maples here and there upon its banks. The sky is covered by a dull\ngray cloud, but in the west the sun shines through a low opening and\ngives promise of a better day. The peculiar liquid effect of the setting\nsun is wonderfully rendered, and the rich browns and russets of the\nfoliage lead up, as it were, like a flight of steps to this final glory,\n—a restful and impressive scene. This landscape is not painted in the\nsmooth manner of the “Two Oaks,” but with soft, flakelike touches which\nslightly remind one of Murillo. Its coloring has the peculiarity that\nartificial light wholly changes its character, whereas Cranch’s\npaintings, previous to 1875, appear much the same by electric light that\nthey do in daytime. It is called the “Home of the Wood Duck.”",
        "Between 1870 and 1880 he published a number of poems in the Atlantic\nMonthly as well as a longer piece called “Satan,” for which it was\nsaid by a certain wit that he received the devil’s pay. His two books for\nyoung folks, “The Last of the Huggermuggers” and “Kobboltozo,” ought not\nto be overlooked, for the illustrations in them are the only remains we\nhave of his rare pencil drawings, as good, if not better, than\nThackeray’s drawings.",
        "It is likely that the parents read these stories with more pleasure than\ntheir children; for they not only contain a deal of fine wit, but there\nis a moral allegory running through them both. An American vessel is\nwrecked on a strange island, and the sailors who have escaped death are\nastonished at the gigantic proportions of the sand and the sea-shells,\nand of the bushes by the shore. Presently the Huggermuggers appear, and\nthe American mariners in terror run to hide themselves; but they soon\nfind that these giants are the kindliest of human beings. There are also\ndwarfs on the island, larger than ordinary men, but small compared with\nthe Huggermuggers. They are disagreeable, envious creatures, who wish to\nruin the giants in order to have the island more entirely to themselves.\nHaving accomplished this in a somewhat mysterious manner, they attempted\nto improve their own stature by eating a certain shell-fish which had\nbeen the favorite food of the giants; but the shell-fish had also\ndisappeared with the Huggermuggers, and after searching for it a long\ntime they finally summoned the Mer-King, the genius of the sea, who\nraised his head above the water in a secluded cove and spoke these\nverses:",
        "This is an allegory, but of very general application; and it has more\nespecially a political application. Cranch may have intended it to\nillustrate the life of Alexander Hamilton.",
        "Cranch was not a giant himself, but he knew how to distinguish true\ngreatness from the spurious commodity. Emerson considered his varied\naccomplishments his worst enemy; but that depends on how you choose to\nlook at it. It is probable enough that if Cranch had followed out a\nsingle pursuit to its perfection, and if he had not lived so many years\nin Europe, he would have been a more celebrated man; but Cranch did not\ncare for celebrity. He was content to live and to let live. Men of great\nforce, like Macaulay and Emerson, who impress their personality on the\ntimes in which they live, communicate evil as well as good; but Cranch\nhad no desire to influence his fellow men, and for this reason his\ninfluence was of a purer quality. It was like the art of Albert Durer. No\none could conceive of Cranch’s injuring anybody; and if all men were like\nhim there would be no more wars, no need of revolutions. Force, however,\nis necessary to combat the evil that is already established.",
        "He died at his house on Ellery Street January 20, 1890, as gently and\npeacefully as he had lived. There is an excellent portrait of him by\nDuveneck in the rooms of the University Club, at Boston; but the sketch\nof his life, by George William Curtis, was refused on the ground that he\nwas an Emersonian. The same objection might have been raised against\nLowell, or Curtis himself with equally good reason.",
        "Thomas G. Appleton, universally known as “Tom” Appleton, was a notable\nfigure during the middle of the last century not only in Boston and\nCambridge, but in Paris, Rome, Florence, and other European cities. He\nwas descended from one of the oldest and wealthiest families of Boston,\nand graduated from Harvard in 1831, together with Wendell Phillips and\nGeorge Lothrop Motley. He was not distinguished in college for his\nscholarship, but rather as a wit, a bon vivant, and a good fellow.\nYet his companions looked upon him as a strong character and much above\nthe average in intellect. After taking his degree of Bachelor of Arts he\nwent through the Law School, and attempted to practise that profession in\nBoston. At the end of the first year, happening to meet Wendell Phillips\non the sidewalk, the latter inquired if he had any clients. He had not;\nneither had Phillips, and they both agreed that waiting for fortune in\nthe legal profession was wearisome business. They were both well adapted\nto it, and the only reason for their ill success would seem to have been\nthat they belonged to wealthy and rather aristocratic families, amongst\nwhom there is little litigation.",
        "At the same time Sumner was laying the foundation by hard study for his\nfuture distinction as a legal authority, and Motley was discussing Goethe\nand Kant with the youthful Bismarck in Berlin. Wendell Phillips soon gave\nup his profession to become an orator in the anti-slavery cause; and Tom\nAppleton went to Rome and took lessons in oil painting.",
        "Nothing can be more superficial than to presume that young men who write\nverses or study painting think themselves geniuses. A man may have a\ngenius for mechanics; and in most instances men and women are attracted\nto the arts from the elevating character of the occupation. It is not\nlikely that Tom Appleton considered himself a genius, for although he had\nplenty of self-confidence, his opinion of himself was always a modest\none. He painted the portraits of some of his friends, but he never fairly\nmade a profession of it. However, he learned the mechanism of pictorial\nart in this way, and soon became one of the best connoisseurs of his\ntime.",
        "His finest enjoyment was to meet with some person, especially a stranger,\nwith whom he could discuss the celebrated works in the galleries of\nEurope. He soon became known as a man who had something to say, and who\nknew how to say it. He told the Italian picture-dealers to cheat him as\nmuch as they could, and he gave amusing accounts of their various\nattempts to do this. He knew more than they did.",
        "After this time he lived as much in Europe as he did in America. Before\n1860 he had crossed the Atlantic nearly forty times. The marriage of his\nsister to Henry W. Longfellow was of great advantage to him, for through\nLongfellow he made the acquaintance of many celebrated persons whom he\nwould not otherwise have known, and being always equal to such occasions\nhe retained their respect and good will. One might also say, “What could\nLongfellow have done without him?” His conversation was never\nforced, and the wit, for which he became as much distinguished in social\nlife as Lowell or Holmes, was never premeditated, often making its\nappearance on unexpected occasions to refresh his hearers with its\nsparkle and originality.",
        "In the “Autocrat of the Breakfast Table” Doctor Holmes quotes this saying\nby the “wittiest of men,” that “good Americans, when they die, go to\nParis.” Now this wittiest of men was Tom Appleton, as many of us knew at\nthat time. He said of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Supper” that it probably\nhad faded out from being stared at by sightseers, and that the same thing\nmight have happened to the Sistine Madonna if it had not been put under\nglass,—these being the two most popular paintings in Europe. His fund of\nanecdotes was inexhaustible.",
        "Earlier in life he was occasionally given to practical jokes. A woman who\nkept a thread and needle store in Boston was supposed to have committed\nmurder, and was tried for it but acquitted. One day, as Appleton was\ngoing by her place of business with a friend he said: “Come in here with\nme; I want to see how that woman looks.” Then surveying the premises, as\nif he wished to find something to purchase, he asked her if she had any\n\"galluses” for sale,—gallus being a shop-boy’s term at the time for\nsuspenders.",
        "When the Art Museum in Boston was first built its odd appearance\nattracted very general attention, and some one asked Tom Appleton what he\nthought of it. “Well,” he said, “I have heard that architecture is a kind\nof frozen music, and if so I should call the Art Museum frozen ’Yankee\nDoodle.’”",
        "Thomas G. Appleton was no dilettante; his interest in the subject was\nserious and abiding. He did not wear his art as he did his gloves, nor\ndid he turn it into an intellectual abstraction. There was nothing he\ndisliked more than the kind of pretension which tries to make a knowledge\nof art a vehicle for self-importance. “Who,” he said, “ought not to feel\nhumble before a painting of Titian’s or Correggio’s? It is only when we\nfeel so that we can appreciate a great work of art.” He believed that an\nimportant moral lesson could be inculcated by a picture as well as by a\npoem,—even by a realistic Dutch painting. “Women worship the Venus of\nMilo now,” he said, “just as they did in ancient Greece, and it is good\nfor them, too.” He respected William Morris Hunt as the best American\npainter of his time, but thought he would be a better painter if he were\nnot so proud. Pride leads to arrogance, and arrogance is blinding.",
        "After he came into possession of his inheritance he showed that he could\nmake a good use of money. One of his first acts was to purchase a set of\nengravings in the Vatican, valued at ten thousand dollars, for the Boston\nPublic Library. “I was not such a fool as to pay that sum for it,\nthough,” he remarked to Rev. Samuel Longfellow. He visited the studios of\nstruggling artists in Rome and Boston, gave them advice and\nencouragement,—made purchases himself, sometimes, and advised his\nfriends to purchase when he found a painting that was really excellent.\nHe also purchased some valuable old paintings to adorn his house on\nCommonwealth Avenue.",
        "He placed two of these at one time on free exhibition at Doll’s picture-\nstore, and going into the rooms where they hung, I found Tom Appleton\nexplaining their merits to a group of remarkably pretty school-girls.",
        "At the same moment, another gentleman who knew Mr. Appleton entered, and\nsaid, “Ah! a Palma Vecio, Mr. Appleton; how delightful! It is a Palma, is\nit not?”",
        "“That,” replied Mr. Appleton, “is probably a Palma; but what do you say\nto this, which I consider a much better picture?” The gentleman did not\nknow; but it looked like Venetian coloring.",
        "“Quite right,” said Mr. Appleton; “I bought it at the sale of a private\ncollection in Rome, and it was catalogued as a Tintoretto, but I said,\n’No, Bassano;’ and it is the best Bassano I ever saw. The Italians call\nit ’Il Coconotte.’”",
        "Mr. Appleton had no intention of palming off doubtful paintings on his\nfriends or the public; but in regard to “Il Coconotte” he was\nconfident of its true value, and rightly so. The painting, so called from\na head in the group covered very thinly with hair, was the pride of his\ncollection and one of the best of Bassano’s works. The other painting\nlooked to me like a Palma, and I have always supposed that it was one.",
        "After this Mr. Appleton branched off on to an interesting anecdote\nconcerning an Italian cicerone, and finally left his audience as well\nentertained as if they had been to the theatre.",
        "In 1871 he published a volume of poems for private circulation, in which\nthere were a number of excellent pieces, and especially two which deserve\na place in any choice collection of American poetry. One is called the\n\"Whip of the Sky” and relates to a subject which Mr. Appleton often dwelt\nupon,—the unnecessary haste and restlessness of American life, and is\ngiven here for the wider circulation which it amply deserves:",
        "Celia Thaxter, the finest of poetic readers, read this to me one\nSeptember morning at the Isles of Shoals, and at the conclusion she\nremarked: “If that could only be read every year in our public schools it\nmight do the American people some good.”",
        "As compared with this, the sonnet on Pompeii has the effect of a strong\ncomplementary color,—for instance, like orange against dark blue. It\nechoes the pathetic reverie that we feel on beholding the monuments of\nthe mighty past. It contains not the pathos of yesterday, nor of a\nhundred years ago, but as Emerson says, “of the time out of mind.”",
        "Tom Appleton was greatly interested in the performances of the\nspiritualists, trance mediums, and other persons pretending to\nsupernatural powers. How far he believed in this occult science can now\nonly be conjectured, but he was not a man to be easily played upon. He\nthought at least that there was more in it than was dreamed of by\nphilosophers. When the Longfellow party was at Florence in April, 1869,\nPrince George of Hanover, recently driven from his kingdom by Bismarck,\ncalled to see the poet, and finding that he had gone out, was entertained\nby Mr. Appleton with some remarkable stories of hypnotic and\nspiritualistic performances. The prince, who was a most amiable looking\nyoung German, was evidently very much interested.",
        "Deafness came upon Mr. Appleton in the last years of his life, though not\nso as to prevent his enjoying the society of those who had clear voices\nand who spoke distinctly. When one of his friends suggested that the\ntrouble might be wax in his ears, he shook his head sadly and said: “Oh\nno: not wax, but wane.”",
        "He was finally taken ill while all alone in New York City, and the\nLongfellows were telegraphed for. When one of his relatives came to him\nhe spoke of his malady in a stoically humorous manner; and his last words\nwere when he was dying: “How interesting this all is!” A man never left\nthis world with a more perfect faith in immortality!",
        "I have often been inside the old Holmes house in Cambridge. It served as\na boarding-house during our college days, but afterwards Professor James\nB. Thayer rented it for a term of years, until it was finally swept away\nlike chaff by President Eliot’s broom of reform. The popular notion that\nit was a quaint-looking old mansion of the eighteenth century, which\nseems to have been encouraged by Doctor Holmes himself, is a\nmisconception. It was a two-and-a-half story, low-studied house, such as\nwere built at the beginning of the last century, with a roof at an angle\nof forty-five degrees and a two-story ell on the right side of the front\ndoor. Doctor Holmes says:",
        "Now, any one who looks carefully at the picture of the old Holmes\nhouse, in Morse’s biography of the Doctor, will perceive that this\nwas not the style of roof which the house had,—at least, in its later\nyears.",
        "Doctor Holmes graduated at Harvard in 1829 at the age of twenty. His\nclass has been a celebrated one in Boston, and there were certainly some\ngood men in it,—especially Benjamin Pierce and James Freeman Clarke,—\nbut I think it was Doctor Holmes’s class-poems that gave it its chief\ncelebrity, which, after all, means that it was a good deal talked about.\nIn one of these he said:",
        "He was said to have composed twenty-nine poems for his class, and then\ndeclared that he had reached the proper limit,—that it would not be\nprudent to go beyond the magical number. It was not a dissipated class,\nbut one with a good deal of life in it, much given to late hours and\njokes, practical and unpractical. The Doctor himself is mysteriously\nsilent concerning his college course, and so are his biographers; but we\nmay surmise that it was not very different in general tenor from\nLowell’s; although his Yankee shrewdness would seem to have preserved him\nfrom serious catastrophes.",
        "In the “Autocrat of the Breakfast Table” Doctor Holmes mentions an early\nacquaintance with Margaret Fuller, which is not referred to by Mr. Morse,\nbut must have arisen either at Mrs. Prentiss’s Boston school or at the\nCambridgeport school which young Oliver afterwards attended. Even at that\nage he recognized Margaret’s intellectual gifts, and he was not a little\nemulous of her; for he fancied that he “had also drawn a small prize in\nthe great literary lottery.” He looked into one of her compositions,\nwhich was lying on the teacher’s desk, and felt quite crest-fallen by\ndiscovering a word in it which he did not know the meaning of. This word\nwas trite; and it may he suspected that a good many use it without\nbeing aware of its proper significance.",
        "Margaret Fuller rose to celebrity with the spontaneity of true genius,\nand left her name high upon the natural bridge of American literature.\nHolmes did not come before the public until years after her death; and\nthen perhaps it might not have happened but for James Russell Lowell and\nthe Atlantic. He was a bright man, and possessed a peculiar mental\nquality of his own; but as we think of him now we can hardly call him a\ngenius. He would evidently have liked in his youth to have made a\nprofession of literature; but his verse lacked the charm and universality\nwhich made Longfellow popular so readily; nor did he possess the daring\nspirit of innovation with which Emerson startled and convinced his\ncontemporaries. He first tried the law, and as that did not suit his\ntaste he fell into medicine, but evidently without any natural bent or\ninclination for the profession. He was fond of the university, and when,\nafter a temporary professorship at Dartmouth he was appointed lecturer on\nanatomy at the Harvard Medical-School, his friends realized that he had\nfound his right position.",
        "Lecturing on anatomy is a routine, but by no means a sinecure. It\nrequires a clearness and accuracy of statement which might be compared to\nthe work of an optician. Some idea of it can be derived from the fact\nthat there may be eight or ten points to a human bone, each of which has\na name of eight or ten syllables,—only to be acquired by the hardest\nstudy. Doctor Holmes’s lecturing manner was incisive and sometimes\npungent, like his conversation, but always good-humored and well\ncalculated to make an impression even on the most lymphatic temperaments.\nWhile it may be said that others might have done it as well, it is\ndoubtful if he could have been excelled in his own specialty. His ready\nfund of wit often served to revive the drooping spirits of his audience,\nand many of his jests have become a kind of legendary lore at the\nMedical-School. Most of them, however, were of a too anatomical character\nto be reproduced in print.",
        "So the years rolled over Doctor Holmes’s head; living quietly, working\nsteadily, and accumulating a store of proverbial wisdom by the way. In\nJune, 1840, he married Amelia Lee Jackson, of Boston, an alliance which\nbrought him into relationship with half the families on Beacon Street,\nand which may have exercised a determining influence on the future course\nof his life. Doctor Holmes was always liberally inclined, and ready to\nwelcome such social and political improvements as time might bring; but\nhe never joined any of the liberal or reformatory movements of his time.\nCertain old friends of Emerson affirmed, when Holmes published his\nbiography of the Concord sage in 1885, that no one else was so much given\nto jesting as Emerson in his younger days. This may have been true; but\nit is also undeniable that Emerson himself had changed much during that\ntime, and that the socialistic Emerson of 1840 was largely a different\nperson from the author of “Society and Solitude.” Holmes had already\ncomposed one of the fairest tributes to Emerson’s intellectual quality\nthat has yet been written.",
        "Emerson began his course in direct apposition to the conventional world;\nbut he was the great magnet of the age, and the world could not help\nbeing attracted by him. It modified its course, and Emerson also modified\nhis, so that the final reconciliation might take place. Meanwhile Doctor\nHolmes pursued the even tenor of his way. Concord does not appear to have\nbeen attractive to him. He had a brother, John Holmes, who was reputed by\nhis friends to be as witty as the “Autocrat” himself, but who lived a\nquiet, inconspicuous life. John was an intimate friend of Hon. E. R. Hoar\nand often went to Concord to visit him; but I never heard of the Doctor\nbeing seen there, though it may have happened before my time. He does not\nspeak over-much of Emerson in his letters, and does not mention\nHawthorne, Thoreau or Alcott, so far as we know, at all. They do not\nappear to have attracted his attention.",
        "We are indebted to Lowell for all that Doctor Holmes has given us. The\nDoctor was forty-eight when the Atlantic Monthly appeared before\nthe public, and according to his own confession he had long since given\nup hope of a literary life. We hardly know another instance like it; but\nso much the better for him. He had no immature efforts of early life to\nregret; and when the cask once was tapped, the old wine came forth with a\nfine bouquet. When Phillips & Sampson consulted Lowell in regard to the\neditorship of the Atlantic, he said at once: “We must get\nsomething from Oliver Wendell Holmes.” He was Lowell’s great discovery\nand proved to be his best card,—a clear, shining light, and not an\nignis fatuus.",
        "When the “Autocrat of the Breakfast Table” first appeared few were in the\nsecret of its authorship and everybody asked: “Who is this new luminary?\"\nIt was exactly what the more intelligent public wanted, and Holmes jumped\nat once into the position in literature which he has held ever since.\nReaders were delighted with his wit, surprised at his originality and\nimpressed by his proverbial wisdom. It was the advent of a sound, healthy\nintelligence, not unlike that of President Lincoln, which could deal with\ncommon-place subjects in a significant and characteristic manner. The\nlandlady’s daughter, the schoolmistress, little Boston, and the young man\ncalled John, are as real and tangible as the dramatis personae in\none of Moliere’s plays. They seem more real to us than many of the\ndistinguished men and women whom we read of in the newspapers.",
        "Doctor Holmes is the American Sterne. He did not seek a vehicle for his\nwit in the oddities and mishaps of English middle-class domestic life,\nbut in the contrasts and incongruities of a Boston boarding-house. He\ninforms us at the outset that he much prefers a family with an ancestry—\none that has had a judge or a governor in it, with old family portraits,\nold books and claw-footed furniture; but if Doctor Holmes had depended on\nsuch society for his material he would hardly have interested the public\nwhom he addressed. One of Goethe’s critics complained that the class of\npersons he had introduced in “Wilhelm Meister” did not belong to good\nsociety; and to this the “aristocratic” poet replied: “I have often been\nin society called good, from which I have not been able to obtain an idea\nfor the shortest poem.”",
        "So it is always: the interesting person is the one who struggles. After\nthe struggle is over, and prosperity commences, the moral ends,—young\nCorey and his bride go off to Mexico. The lives of families are\nrepresented by those of its prominent individuals. The ambitious son of\nan old and wealthy family makes a new departure from former precedents,\nthus creating a fresh struggle for himself, and becomes an orator, like\nWendell Philips, or a scientist, like Darwin.",
        "In the “Autocrat” we recognize the dingy wall-paper of the dining-room,\nthe well-worn furniture, the cracked water-pitcher, and the slight aroma\nof previous repasts; but we soon forget this unattractive background, for\nthe scene is full of genuine human life. The men and women who congregate\nthere appear for what they really are. They wear no mental masks and\nother disguises like the people we meet at fashionable entertainments;\nand each acts himself or herself. Boarding-houses, sanitariums, and sea\nvoyages are the places to study human nature. When a man is half seasick\nthe old original Adam shows forth in him through all the wrappings of\neducation, social restraint, imitation and attempts at self-improvement,\nwith which he has covered it over for so many years. Once on a Cunard\nsteamship I heard an architect from San Francisco tell the story of the\nhoop-snake, which takes its tail in its teeth and rolls over the prairies\nat a speed equal to any express train. He evidently believed the story\nhimself, and as I looked round on the company I saw that they all\nbelieved it, too, excepting Captain Martyn, who gave me a sly look from\nthe corner of his eye. “Rocked in the cradle of the deep,” they had\nbecome like children again, and were ready to credit anything that was\ntold in a confident manner. But Doctor Holmes’s digressions are\ninfectious.",
        "The “Autocrat of the Breakfast Table” is an irregular panorama of human\nlife without either a definite beginning or end,—unless the autocrat’s\noffering himself to the schoolmistress (an incident which only took place\non paper) can be considered so; but it is by no means a patchwork. He\ntalks of horse-racing, the Millerites, elm trees, Doctor Johnson, the\ncomposition of poetry and much else; but these subjects are introduced\nand treated with an adroitness that amounts to consummate art. He is\nalways at the boarding-house, and if his remarks sometimes shoot over the\nheads of his auditors, this is only because he intends that they should.\nThe first ten or fifteen pages of the “Autocrat” are written in such a\ncold, formal and pedantic manner that the wonder is that Lowell should\nhave published it. After that the style suddenly changes and the Doctor\nbecomes himself. It is like a convention call which ends in a sympathetic\nconversation.",
        "Doctor Holmes’s humor permeates every sentence that he wrote. Even in his\nmost serious moods we meet with it in a peculiar phrase, or the use of\nsome exceptional word.",
        "Now and then his wit is very brilliant, lighting up its surroundings like\nthe sudden appearance of a meteor. The essence of humor consists in a\ncontrast which places the object or person compared at a disadvantage. If\nthe contrast is a dignified one we have high comedy; but if the reverse,\nlow comedy. Some of Holmes’s comparisons make the reader laugh out aloud.\nHe says that a tedious preacher or lecturer, with an alert listener in\nthe audience, resembles a crow followed by a king-bird,—a spectacle\nwhich of itself is enough to make one smile; and as for an elevated\ncomparison, what could be more so, unless we were to seek one in the\nmoon. There is a threefold wit in it; but the full force of this can only\nbe appreciated in the original text.",
        "Nature commonly sets her own stamp on the face of a humorist. The long\npointed nose of Cervantes is indicative of immeasurable fun, and there\nhave been many similar noses on the faces of less distinguished wits.\nDoctor Holmes ridiculed phrenology as an attempt to estimate the money in\na safe by the knobs on the outside, but he evidently was a believer in\nphysiognomy, and he exemplified this in his own case. His face had a\ncomical expression from boyhood; its profile reminded one of those\nprehistoric images which Di Cesnola brought from Cyprus. As if he were\nconscious of this he asserted his dignity in a more decided manner than a\nman usually does who is confident of the respect of those about him. Thus\nhe acquired a style of his own, different from that of any other person\nin Boston. He was not a man to be treated with disrespect or undue\nfamiliarity.",
        "A medical student named Holyoke once had occasion to call on him, and as\nsoon as he had introduced himself Doctor Holmes said: “There, me friend,\nstand there and let me take an observation of you.” He then fetched an\nold book from his library which contained a portrait of Holyoke’s\ngrandfather, who had also been a physician. He compared the two faces,\nsaying: “Forehead much the same; nose not so full; mouth rather more\nfeminine; chin not quite so strong; but on the whole a very good\nlikeness, and I have no doubt you will make an excellent doctor.” After\nHolyoke had explained his business Doctor Holmes finally said: “I liked\nyour grandfather, and shall always be glad to see you here.”",
        "Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., was class poet of 1861, an honor which\npleased his father very much. Immediately after graduating he went to the\nwar, and came near losing his life at the battle of Antietam. A rifle-\nball passed through both lungs, and narrowly missed his heart. Alexander\nHamilton died of exactly such a wound in seven hours; and yet in three\ndays Captain Holmes was able to write to his father. The Doctor started\nat once for the seat of war, and met with quite a series of small\nadventures which he afterwards described in a felicitous article in the\nAtlantic, called “My Hunt after the Captain.” His friend, Dr.\nHenry P. Bowditch, lost his son in the same battle, and when they met at\nthe railway depot Holmes said: “I would give my house to have your\nfortune like mine.”",
        "In a letter to Motley dated February 3, 1862, he says:",
        "“I was at a dinner at Parker’s the other day where Governor Andrew and\nEmerson, and various unknown dingy-linened friends of progress met to\nhear Mr. Conway, the not unfamous Unitarian minister of Washington,—\nVirginia-born, with seventeen secesh cousins, fathers, and other\nrelatives,—tell of his late experience at the seat of Government. He is\nan out-and-out immediate emancipationist,—believes that is the only way\nto break the strength of the South; that the black man is the life of the\nSouth; that they dread work above all things, and cling to the slave as\nthe drudge that makes life tolerable to them. I do not know if his\nopinion is worth much.”",
        "This was a meeting of the Bird Club which Doctor Holmes attended and the\ndingy-linened friends of progress were such men as Dr. Samuel G. Howe,\nGovernor Washburn, Governor Claflin, Dr. Estes Howe, and Frank B.\nSanborn. It has always been a trick of fashionable society, a trick as\nold as the age of Pericles, to disparage liberalism by accusing it of\nvulgarity; but we regret to find Doctor Holmes falling into line in this\nparticular. He always speaks of Sumner in his letters with something like\na slur—not to Motley, for Motley was Sumner’s friend, but to others who\nmight be more sympathetic. This did not, however, prevent him from going\nto Sumner in 1868 to ask a favor for his second son, who wanted to be\nprivate secretary to the Senator and learn something of foreign affairs.\nSumner granted the request, although he must have been aware that the\nDoctor was not over-friendly to him; but it proved an unfortunate\ncircumstance for Edward J. Holmes, who contracted malaria in Washington,\nand this finally resulted in an early death.",
        "Why is it that members of the medical profession should take an\nexceptional interest in poisonous reptiles? Professor Reichert and Dr. S.\nWeir Mitchell spent a large portion of their leisure hours for several\nyears in experimenting with the virus of rattlesnakes, and of the Gila\nmonster, without, however, quite exhausting the subject. Doctor Holmes\nkept a rattlesnake in a cage for a pet, and was accustomed to stir it up\nwith an ox-goad. A New York doctor lost his life by fooling with a\npoisonous snake, and another in Liverpool frightened a whole congregation\nof scientists with two torpid rattlesnakes which suddenly came to life on\nthe president’s table. Does it arise from their custom of dealing with\ndeadly poisons, or is it because they officiate as the high priests of\nmortality?",
        "Doctor Holmes’s “Elsie Venner” was one of the offshoots of this peculiar\nmedical interest, and when we think of it in that light the story seems\nnatural enough. The idea of a snaky woman is as old as the fable of\nMedusa. I read the novel when I was fifteen, and it made as decided an\nimpression on me as “Ivanhoe” or “Pickwick.” I remember especially a\nproverbial saying of the old doctor who serves as the presiding genius of\nthe plot: he knew “the kind of people who are never sick but what they\nare going to die, and the other kind who never know they are sick until\nthey are dead.” If Doctor Holmes had taken this as his text, and written\na novel on those lines, he might have created a work of far-reaching\nimportance. He appears to have known very little concerning poisonous\nreptiles; had never heard of the terrible fer-de-lance, which infests the\ncane-swamps of Brazil—a snake ten feet in length which strikes without\nwarning and straight as a fencer’s thrust. But “Elsie Venner” and\nHolmes’s second novel, “The Guardian Angel,” are, to use Lowell’s\nexpression on a different subject:",
        "In the autumn of 1865 some Harvard students, radically inclined, obtained\npossession of a religious society in the college called the Christian\nUnion, revolutionized it and changed its name to the Liberal Fraternity.\nThey then invited Emerson, Henry James, Sr., Doctor Holmes, and Colonel\nHigginson to deliver lectures in Cambridge under their auspices. This was\na pretty bold stroke, but Holmes evidently liked it. He said to the\ncommittee that waited upon him: “What is your rank and file? How deep do\nyou go down into the class?” He also promised to lecture, and that he did\nnot was more the fault of the students than his own. He was by no means a\nradical in religious matters, but he hated small sectarian differences—\nthe substitution of dogma for true religious feeling. In his poem at the\ngrand Harvard celebration in 1886 he made a special point of this\nprinciple:",
        "Creeds are necessary, however, and an enlightened education teaches us\nnot to value them above their true worth.",
        "In 1867 Doctor Holmes published a volume of poetry which was generally\nwell received, but was criticised in the Nation with needless and\nunmerciful severity. Rev. Edward Everett Hale and other friends of his\nhad already been attacked in the same periodical, and the Doctor thought\nhe knew the man who did it; but whether he was right in his conjecture\ncannot be affirmed. There can be no doubt that these diatribes were\nwritten by a Harvard professor who owned a large interest in the\nNation, and who was obliged to go to Europe the following year in\norder to escape the odium of an imprudent speech at a public dinner. In\nthis critique Holmes’s poetry was summed up under the heading of\n\"versified misfortunes\"; and Holmes himself wrote to Mrs. Stowe that the\nobject of the writer was evidently “to injure at any rate, and to wound\nif possible.”",
        "It was certainly contemptible to treat a man like Doctor Holmes in this\nmanner,—one so universally kind to others, and whose work was always, at\nleast, above mediocrity. He behaved in a dignified manner in regard to\nit, and he made no attempt at self-justification, although the wound was\nevidently long in healing. What recourse has a man who places himself\nbefore the public against the envenomed shafts of an invisible adversary?\nOf this at least we may be satisfied, that whatever is extravagant and\noverwrought always brings its own reaction in due course; and Doctor\nHolmes’s reputation does not appear to have suffered permanently from\nthis attack. The general public, especially the republic of womankind,\nforms its own opinion, and pays slight attention to literary criticisms\nof that description.",
        "Holmes’s poetry rarely rises to eloquence, but neither does it descend to\nsentimentality. It resembles the man’s own life, in which there were no\nbold endeavors, great feats, or desperate struggles; but it was a life so\njudicious, healthful and highly intellectual that we cannot help admiring\nit. “Dorothy Q.” is perhaps the best of his short poems, as it is the\nmost widely known. The name itself is slightly humorous, but it is a\nperfect work of art, and the line,",
        "has the beautiful hush of a sanctuary in it. A finer verse could not be\nwritten. Also for a comic piece nothing equal to “The Wonderful One-hoss\nShay” has appeared since Burns’s “Tam O’Shanter.” It is based on a\nlogical illusion which brings it down to recent times, and the gravity\nwith which the story is narrated makes its impossibility all the more\namusing. The building of the chaise is described with a practical\naccuracy of detail, and yet with a poetical turn to every verse:",
        "I believe that even cultivated readers have found more real satisfaction\nin the “One-Hoss Shay” than in many a more celebrated lyric.",
        "Doctor Holmes lived amid a comparatively narrow circle of friends and\nacquaintances. He attended the Saturday Club, but Lowell appears to have\nbeen the only member of it with whom he was on confidential terms. He was\nrarely seen or heard of in Longfellow’s house. In the winter of 1878 he\nmet Mrs. L. Maria Child for the first time at the Chestnut Street Club.\nIt appears that she did not catch his name when he was introduced to her,\nand stranger still did not recognize his face. When the Doctor inquired\nconcerning her literary occupation she replied that she considered\nherself too old to drive a quill any longer, and then fortunately added:\n\"Now, there is Doctor Holmes, I think he shows his customary good\njudgment in retiring from the literary field in proper season.” What the\nDoctor thought of this is unknown, but he still continued to write.",
        "At the age of seventy his alma mater conferred on Doctor Holmes an\nLL.D., and this was followed soon afterwards by Oxford and Cambridge, in\nEngland; but why was it not given ten or fifteen years earlier, when\nHolmes was in his prime? Then it might have been a service and a\nsatisfaction to him; but when a man is seventy such tributes have small\nvalue for him. There had been an Atlantic breakfast for Doctor\nHolmes in Boston, and a Holmes breakfast in New York. He was in the\npublic eye, and by honoring him the University honored itself. So Harvard\nconferred an LL.D. on General Winfield Scott just before the fatal battle\nof Bull Run,—instead of after his brilliant Mexican campaign. If the\ndegree was not conferred on Holmes for his literary work, what reason\ncould be assigned for it; and if he deserved it on that account, Emerson\nand Hawthorne certainly deserved it much more. Let us be thankful that no\nsuch mischief was contemplated. If honorary degrees are to be given in\norder to attract attention to a university, or worse still, for the\npurpose of obtaining legacies, they had better be abolished altogether.",
        "During his last visit to England Doctor Holmes was the guest of F. Max\nMuller at Oxford, and years afterwards Professor Muller wrote to an\nAmerican correspondent concerning him and others:",
        "“Froude was a dear friend of mine, related to my wife; so was Kingsley—\ndear soul. Renan used to fetch books for me when we first met at the\nBibliothique Royale. Emerson stayed at my house on his last visit here.\nBut the best of all my American friends was Wendell Holmes. When he left\nus he said, ’I have talked to thousands of people—you are the only one\nwith whom I have had a conversation.’ We had talked about [Greek: ta\nmegisthta]—the world as the logos, as the thought of God. What a pure\nsoul his was—a real Serene Highness.”",
        "This is trancendentalism from the fountainhead; and here Doctor Holmes\nmay fairly be said to have avenged himself on the Nation’s\nexcoriating critic.",
        "It is less than four miles from Harvard Square to Boston City Hall, a\nbuilding rather exceptional for its fine architecture among public\nedifices, but the change in 1865 was like the change from one sphere of\nhuman thought and activity to another. In Boston politics was everything,\nand literature, art, philosophy nothing, or next to nothing. There was\nmercantile life, of course, and careworn merchants anxiously waiting\nabout the gold-board; but there were no tally-ho coaches; there was no\ngolf or polo, and very little yachting. Fashionable society was also at a\nlow ebb, and as Wendell Phillips remarked in 1866, the only parties were\nboys’ and girls’ dancing-parties. A large proportion of the finest young\nmen in the city had, like the Lowells, shed their blood for the Republic.\nThe young people danced, but their elders looked grave.",
        "At this time the political centre of Massachusetts and, to a certain\nextent of New England, was the Bird Club, which met every Saturday\nafternoon at Young’s Hotel to dine and discuss the affairs of the nation.\nIts membership counted both Senators, the Governor, a number of ex-\nGovernors and four or five members of Congress. They were a strong team\nwhen they were all harnessed together.",
        "Francis William Bird, the original organizer of the club, was born in\nDedham, October 22, 1809, and the only remarkable fact concerning his\nancestry would seem to be that his great-grandmother was a Hawthorne, of\nthe same family as Nathaniel Hawthorne; but there was no trace of that\nstrongly-marked lineage in his composition. As a boy he was quick at\nmathematics, but not much of a student, so that he was full eighteen\nyears of age before he entered Brown University. His college course also\nleft him in a depleted physical condition, and it was several years later\nwhen he commenced the actual labor of life. His father had intended him\nfor the law; but this did not agree with his health, and his physician\nadvised a more active employment. Accordingly we find him in 1835 engaged\nin the manufacture of paper at East Walpole, an occupation in which he\ncontinued until 1892,—always suffering from dyspepsia, but always equal\nto whatever occasion demanded of him. He was a tall, thin, wiry-looking\nman, with a determined expression, but of kind and friendly manners.",
        "He must have been a skilful man of business, for all the great financial\nstorms of the half century, in which he lived and worked, rolled over him\nwithout causing him any serious embarrassment. His note was always good,\nand his word was as good as his note. He always seemed to have money\nenough for what he wanted to do. In prosperous times he spent generously,\nalthough habitually practising a kind of stoical severity in regard to\nhis private affairs. He considered luxury the bane of wealth, and\ncontinually admonished his children to avoid it. He was an old-fashioned\nPuritan with liberal and progressive ideas.",
        "After his marriage in 1843 to Miss Abigail Frances Newell, of Boston, he\nbuilt a commodious house in a fine grove of chestnuts on a hill-side at\nEast Walpole; and there he brought up his children like Greeks and\nAmazons. Chestnut woods are commonly infested with hornets, but he\ndirected us boys not to molest them, for he wished them to learn that\nhornets would not sting unless they were interfered with; an excellent\nprinciple in human nature. Mrs. Bird resembled her husband so closely in\nface and figure, that they might have been mistaken for brother and\nsister. She was an excellent New England woman of the old style, and well\nadapted to make her husband comfortable and happy.",
        "The connection between manufacturing and politics is a direct and natural\none. A man who employs thirty or forty workmen, and treats them fairly,\ncan easily obtain an election to the Legislature without exercising any\ndirect influence over them; but Frank Bird’s workmen felt that he had a\npersonal interest in each one of them. He never was troubled with\nstrikes. When hard times came his employees submitted to a reduction of\nwages without murmuring, and when business was good they shared again in\nthe general prosperity. As a consequence Mr. Bird could go to the\nLegislature as often as he desired; and when he changed from the\nRepublican to the Democratic party, in 1872, they still continued to vote\nfor him, until at the age of seventy-one he finally retired from public\nlife.",
        "On one election day he is said to have called his men together, and to\nhave told them: “You will have two hours this afternoon to cast your\nvotes in. The mill will close at 4 o’clock, and I expect every man to\nvote as I do. Now I am going to vote just as I please, and I hope you\nwill all do the same; but if any one of my men does not vote just as he\nwants to, and I find it out, I will discharge him to-morrow.” One can\nimagine Abraham Lincoln making a speech like this, on a similar occasion.",
        "Frank W. Bird, like J. B. Sargent, of New Haven, was a rare instance of\nan American manufacturer who believed in free-trade. This was one reason\nwhy he joined the Democratic party in 1872. He considered that protection\nencouraged sleazy and fraudulent work, and placed honest manufacturers at\na disadvantage; though he obtained these ideas rather from reading\nEnglish magazines than from any serious study of his own. He was\nnaturally much more of a Democrat than a Whig, or Federalist, but he\nopposed the doctrine of State Rights, declaring that it was much more\nresponsible for the Civil War than the anti-slavery agitation was.",
        "The same political exigency which roused James Russell Lowell also\nbrought Francis William Bird before the public. In company with Charles\nFrancis Adams he attended the Buffalo convention, in 1848, and helped to\nnominate Martin Van Buren for the Presidency. He was, however, doing more\neffective work by assisting Elizur Wright in publishing the\nChronotype (the most vigorous of all the anti-slavery papers),\nboth with money and writing; and in a written argument there were few who\ncould equal him. He appears to have been the only person at that time who\ngave Elizur Wright much support and encouragement.",
        "In 1850 Bird was elected to the State Legislature and worked vigorously\nfor the election of Sumner the ensuing winter. His chief associates\nduring the past two years had been Charles Francis Adams, the most\ndistinguished of American diplomats since Benjamin Franklin, John A.\nAndrew, then a struggling lawyer, and Henry L. Pierce, afterwards Mayor\nof Boston. Now a greater name was added to them; for Sumner was not only\nan eloquent orator, perhaps second to Webster, but he had a worldwide\nreputation as a legal authority.",
        "Adams, however, failed to recognize that like his grandfather he was\nliving in a revolutionary epoch, and after the Kansas struggle commenced\nhe became continually more conservative—if that is the word for it—and\nfinally in his Congressional speech in the winter of 1861 he made the\nfatal statement that personally he would be “in favor of permitting the\nSouthern States to secede,\" although he could not see that there was any\nlegal right for it. This acted as a divider between him and his former\nassociates, until in 1876 he found himself again in the same party with\nFrank W. Bird.",
        "During the administration of Governor Banks, that is, between 1857 and\n1860, Bird served on the Governor’s council, although generally in\nopposition to Banks himself. He went as a delegate to the Chicago\nConvention of 1860, where he voted at first for Seward, and afterwards\nfor Lincoln. From that time forward, until 1880, he was always to be\nfound at the State House, and devoted so much time to public affairs that\nit is a wonder his business of paper manufacturing did not suffer from\nit. Yet he always seemed to have plenty of time, and was never so much\nabsorbed in what he was doing but that he could give a cordial greeting\nto any of his numerous friends. His face would beam with pleasure at the\nsight of an old acquaintance, and I have known him to dash across the\nstreet like a school-boy in order to intercept a former member of the\nLegislature who was passing by on the other side. Such a man has a good\nheart.",
        "Frank Bird’s abilities fitted him for higher positions than he ever\noccupied; but he was so serviceable in the Legislature that all his\nfriends felt that he ought to remain there. He was inexorable in his\ndemand for honest government, and when he rose to speak all the guilty\nconsciences in the house began to tremble. He was the terror of the\nlobbyist, and of the legislative log-roller. This made him many enemies,\nbut he expected it and knew how to meet them. He was especially feared\nwhile Andrew was Governor, for every one knew that he had consulted with\nAndrew before making his motion. He was the Governor’s man of business.",
        "He came to know the character of every politician in the State,—what his\nopinions were, and how far he could be depended on. In this way he also\nbecame of great service to Sumner and Wilson, who wished to know what was\ntaking place behind their backs while they were absent at Washington.\nSumner did not trouble himself much as to public opinion, but this was of\ngreat importance to Wilson, who depended on politics for his daily bread.\nBoth, however, wanted to know the condition of affairs in their own\nState, and they found that Frank Bird’s information was always\ntrustworthy,—for he had no ulterior object of his own.",
        "Thus he acquired much greater influence in public affairs than most of\nthe members of Congress. When Mr. Baldwin, who represented his district,\nretired in 1868, Frank Bird became a candidate for the National\nLegislature, but he suffered from the disadvantage of living at the small\nend of the district, and the prize was carried off by George F. Hoar,\nafterwards United States Senator; but going to Congress in the seventies\nwas not what it had been in the fifties and sixties, when the halls of\nthe Capitol resounded with the most impressive oratory of the nineteenth\ncentury.",
        "Frank Bird did not pretend to be an orator. His speeches were frank,\nmethodical and directly to the point; and very effective with those who\ncould be influenced by reason, without appeals to personal prejudice. He\nhated flattery in all its forms, and honestly confessed that the\ntemptation of public speakers to cajole their audiences was the one great\ndemon of a democratic government. He liked Wendell Phillips on account of\nthe manly way in which he fought against his audiences, and strove to\nbring them round to his own opinion.",
        "He was as single-minded as Emerson or Lincoln. In November, 1862, Emerson\nsaid to me: “I came from Springfield the other day in the train with your\nfather’s friend, Frank Bird, and I like him very much. I often see his\nname signed to newspaper letters, and in future I shall always read\nthem.” Strangely enough, a few days later I was dining with Mr. Bird and\nhe referred to the same incident. When I informed him that Emerson had\nalso spoken of it he seemed very much pleased.",
        "If any one paid him a compliment or expressed gratitude for some act of\nkindness, he would hesitate and become silent for a moment, as if he were\nreflecting whether he deserved it or not; and then would go on to some\nother subject.",
        "His acts of kindness were almost numberless. He assisted those whom\nothers would not assist; and if he suspected that a small office-holder\nwas being tyrannized over, he would take no rest until he had satisfied\nhimself of the truth of the case. In February, 1870, he learned that a\nhigh official in the Boston Post-office, who was supported in his\nposition by the Governor of the State, was taking advantage of this to\nlevy a blackmail on his subordinates, compelling them to pay him a\ncommission in order to retain their places. Frank Bird was furious with\nhonest indignation. He said: “I will go to Washington and have that man\nturned out if I have to see Grant himself for it\"; and so he did.",
        "One evening at Walpole a poor woman came to him in distress, because her\nonly son had been induced to enlist in the Navy, and was already on board\na man-of-war at the Boston Navy-yard. Mr. Bird knew the youth, and was\naware that he was very slightly feeble-minded. The vessel would sail in\nthree days, and there was no time to be lost. He telegraphed the facts as\nbriefly as possible to Senator Wilson, and in twenty-four hours received\nan order to have the widow’s son discharged. Then he would not trust the\norder to the commandant, who might have delayed its execution, but sent\nit to an agent of his own in the Navy-yard, who saw that the thing was\ndone.",
        "Frank Bird’s most distinguished achievement in politics was the\nnomination of Andrew for Governor in 1860. Governor Banks was not\nfavorable to Andrew and his friends, and used what influence he possessed\nfor the benefit of Henry L. Dawes. An organization for the nomination of\nDawes had already been secretly formed before Frank Bird was acquainted\nwith Banks’s retirement from the field. Bird and Henry L. Pierce were at\nPlymouth when they first heard of it, about the middle of July, and they\nimmediately returned to Boston, started a bureau, opened a subscription-\nlist, and with the cooperation of the Bird Club carried the movement\nthrough. It would have made a marked difference in public affairs during\nthe War for the Union if Dawes had been Governor instead of Andrew.\n[Footnote: Dawes was an excellent man in his way, but during eighteen\nyears in the United States Senate he never made an important speech.]",
        "Frank Bird had this peculiarity, that the more kindly he felt to those\nwho were unfortunate in life, the more antagonistic he seemed to those\nwho were exceptionally prosperous. He appeared to have a sort of spite\nagainst handsome men and women, as if nature had been over-partial to\nthem in comparison with others. He was not a pedantic moralist, but at\nthe same time rather exacting in his requirements of others, as he was of\nhimself.",
        "The Bird Club was evolved out of the conditions of its times, like a\nnatural growth. Its nucleus was formed in the campaign of 1848, when\nBird, Andrew, Henry L. Pierce, and William S. Robinson fell into the\nhabit of dining together and discussing public affairs every Saturday\nafternoon. It was not long before they were joined by Elizur Wright and\nHenry Wilson. Sumner came to dine with them, when he was not in\nWashington, and Dr. S. G. Howe came with him. The Kansas excitement\nbrought in George L. Stearns and Frank B. Sanborn,—one the president and\nthe other the secretary of the Kansas Aid Society. In 1860 the club had\nfrom thirty to forty members, and during the whole course of its\nexistence it had more than sixty members; but it never had any regular\norganization. A member could bring a friend with him, and if the friend\nwas liked, Mr. Bird would invite him to come again. No vote ever appears\nto have been taken. Mr. Bird sat at the head of the table, and if he was\nlate or absent his place would be supplied by George L. Stearns. At his\nright hand sat Governor Andrew, and either Sumner or Stearns on his left.\nDoctor Howe and Wilson sat next to them, and were balanced on the\nopposite side by Sanborn, Governor Washburn, and two or three members of\nCongress. However, there was no systematic arrangement of the guests at\nthis feast, although the more important members of the club naturally\nclustered about Mr. Bird.",
        "N. P. Banks never appeared there, either as Governor or General; and from\nthis it was argued that he was ambitious to become Senator; or it may\nhave been owing to his differences with Bird, while the latter was on the\nGovernor’s Council. In this way the Bird Club became the test of a man’s\npolitical opinion, and prominent politicians who absented themselves from\nit were looked upon with more or less distrust.",
        "The discussions at the club were frank, manly, and unreserved. Members\nwho talked from the point were likely to be corrected without ceremony,\nand sometimes received pretty hard knocks. On one occasion General B. F.\nButler, who had come into the club soon after his celebrated contraband-\nof-war order, was complaining that the New York Republicans had nominated\nGeneral Francis C. Barlow for Secretary of State, and that General Barlow\nhad not been long enough in the Republican party to deserve it, when\nRobinson replied to him that Barlow had been a Republican longer than\nsome of those present, and Frank Bird remarked that he was as good a\nRepublican as any that were going. Butler looked as if he had swallowed a\npill.",
        "William S. Robinson was at once the wit and scribe of the club, and the\nonly newswriter that was permitted to come to the table. He enjoyed the\nadvantage of confidential talk and authentic information, which no other\nwriter of that time possessed, and his letters to the Springfield\nRepublican, extending over a period of fifteen years, come next in\nvalue to the authentic documents of that important period. They possessed\nthe rare merit of a keen impartiality, and though sometimes rather sharp,\nwere never far from the mark. He not only criticised Grant and the\npolitical bosses of that time, but his personal friends, Sumner, Wilson,\nand Frank Bird himself.",
        "In 1872 Emerson said to a member of the club: “I do not like William\nRobinson. His hand is against every man\"; but it is doubtful if Robinson\never published so hard a criticism of any person, and certainly none so\nunjust. Emerson without being aware of it was strongly influenced by a\ncabal for the overthrow of Robinson, in which General Butler took a\nleading hand. Robinson was clerk of the State Senate, and could not\nafford to lose his position; afterwards, when he did lose it, he fell\nsick and died. He preferred truth-telling and poverty to a compromising\nprosperity, and left no one to fill his place.",
        "Frank B. Sanborn was for a time editor of the Boston Commonwealth,\nand afterwards of the Springfield Republican; but he was better\nknown as the efficient Secretary of the Board of State Charities, a\nposition to which he was appointed by Governor Andrew, and from which he\nwas unjustly removed by Governor Ames, twenty years later. He was an\nindefatigable worker, and during that time there was not an almshouse or\nother institution, public or private, in the State for the benefit of the\nunfortunate portion of mankind where he was not either feared or\nrespected—a man whose active principle was the conscientious performance\nof duty. He was also noted for his fidelity to his friends. He cared for\nthe family of John Brown and watched over their interests as if they had\nbeen his own family; he made a home for the poet Channing in his old age,\nand was equally devoted to the Alcotts and others, who could not\naltogether help themselves. He was himself a charitable institution.",
        "Henry Wilson is also worth a passing notice, for the strange resemblance\nof his life to President Lincoln’s, if for no other reason. His name was\noriginally Colbath, and he was reputed to have been born under a barbery-\nbush in one of the green lanes of New Hampshire. The name is an\nexceptional one, and the family would seem to have been of the same\nroving Bedouin-like sort as that of Lincoln’s ancestors. He began life as\na shoemaker, was wholly self-educated, and changed his name to escape\nfrom his early associations. He would seem to have absorbed all the\nvirtue in his family for several generations. No sooner had he entered\ninto politics than he was recognized to have a master hand. He rose\nrapidly to the highest position in the gift of his State, and finally to\nbe Vice-President. If his health had not given way in 1873 he might even\nhave become President in the place of Hayes; for he was a person whom\nevery man felt that he could trust. His loyalty to Sumner bordered on\nveneration, and was the finest trait in his character. There was no\npretense in Henry Wilson’s patriotism; everyone felt that he would have\ndied for his country.",
        "In 1870 General Butler disappeared from the club, to the great relief of\nSumner and his immediate friends. He had already shown the cloven foot by\nattacking the financial credit of the government; and the question was,\nwhat would he do next? He had found the club an obstacle to his further\nadvancement in politics, and when in the autumn campaign Wendell Phillips\nmade a series of attacks on the character of the club, and especially on\nBird himself, the hand of Butler was immediately recognized in it, and\nhis plans for the future were easily calculated. It is probable that\nPhillips supposed he was doing the public a service in this, but the\nmethods he pursued were not much to his credit. Phillips learned that the\npresident of the Hartford and Erie Railroad had recently given Mr. Bird\nan Alderney bull-calf, and as he could not find anything else against\nBird’s character he made the most of this. He spoke of it as of the\nnature of a legislative bribe, and in an oration delivered in the Boston\nMusic Hall he called it “a thousand dollars in blood.”",
        "“Who,” he asked of his audience, “would think of exchanging a bird\nfor a bull!”",
        "This was unfortunate for the calf, which lost its life in consequence;\nbut it was not worth more than ten dollars, and the contrast between the\nrespective reputations of General Butler and Mr. Bird made Wendell\nPhillips appear in rather a ridiculous light.",
        "The following year, 1871, as the Bird Club expected, General Butler made\na strong fight for the gubernatorial nomination, and the club opposed him\nin a solid body. Sanborn at this time was editing the Springfield\nRepublican, and he exposed Butler’s past political course in an\nunsparing manner. Butler made speeches in all the cities and larger towns\nof the State, and when he came to Springfield he singled out Sanborn,\nwhom he recognized in the audience, for a direct personal attack. Sanborn\nrose to reply to him, and the contrast between the two men was like that\nbetween Lincoln and Douglas; Sanborn six feet four inches in height, and\nButler much shorter, but very thick-set. The altercation became a warm\none, and Butler must have been very angry, for he grew red in the face\nand danced about the platform as if the boards were hot under his feet.\nThe audience greeted both speakers with applause and hisses.",
        "It was a decided advantage for General Butler that there were three other\ncandidates in the field; but both Sumner and Wilson brought their\ninfluence to bear against him, and this, with Sanborn’s telling\neditorials, would seem to have decided his defeat; for when the final\nstruggle came at the Worcester Convention the vote was a very close one\nand a small matter might have changed it in his favor.",
        "The difference between Sumner and the administration, in 1872, on the San\nDomingo question accomplished what Phillips and Butler were unable to\neffect. Frank Bird and Sumner’s more independent friends left the club,\nwhich was then dining at Young’s Hotel, and seceded to the Parker House,\nwhere Sumner joined them not long afterwards. Senator Wilson and the more\ndeep-rooted Republicans formed a new organization called the\nMassachusetts Club, which still existed in the year 1900.",
        "The great days of the Bird Club were over. With the death of Sumner, in\n1874, its political importance came to an end, and although its members\ncontinued to meet for five or six years longer, it ceased to attract\npublic attention.",
        "At the age of eighty Frank W. Bird still directed the financial affairs\nof his paper business, but he looked back on his life as a “wretched\nfailure.” No matter how much he accomplished, it seemed to him as nothing\ncompared with what he had wished to do. Would there were more such\nfailures!",
        "Charles Pickney Sumner, the father of Charles Sumner, was a man of an\nessentially veracious nature. He was high sheriff of Suffolk County,\nMassachusetts, and when there was a criminal to be executed he always\nperformed the office himself. Once when some one inquired why he did not\ndelegate such a disagreeable task to one of his deputies, he is said to\nhave replied, “Simply because it is disagreeable.” It was this elevated\nsense of moral responsibility which formed the keynote of his son’s\ncharacter.",
        "Charles Sumner’s mother was Miss Relief Jacobs, a name in which we\ndistinguish at once a mixture of the Hebrew and the Puritan. She belonged\nin fact to a Christianized Jewish family, but how long since her\nancestors became Christianized remains in doubt. Yet it is easy to\nrecognize the Hebrew element in Sumner’s nature; the inflexibility of\npurpose, the absolute self-devotion, and even the prophetic forecast.\nSumner was an old Hebrew prophet in the guise of an American statesman.\nTrue to his mother’s name, he was at once a Puritan and an Israelite in\nwhom there was no guile; for he was wholly exempt from covetousness and\nother meaner qualities of the Hebrew nature. In such respects Jews and\nYankees are much alike. Either they are generous and high-minded, or they\nare not.",
        "Charles was rather a peculiar boy, as great men are apt to be in their\nyouth. He cared little for boyish games, and still less for the bright\neyes of the girls. He had remarkably long arms and legs, which were too\noften in the way of his comrades, and from which he derived the nickname\nat the Latin-School of “gawky Sumner\"; and it may be well to notice here\nthat there is no better sign for future superiority than for a lad to be\nridiculed in this manner; while the wags who invent such sobriquets\nusually come to no good end. [Footnote: More than one such has died the\ndeath of an inebriate.] There is sufficient evidence, however, that\nSumner was well liked both at school and at college.",
        "He had his revenge on declamation day, for whereas others stumbled\nthrough their pieces, he seemed perfectly at home on the platform; his\nawkwardness disappeared and his performance gave plain indications of the\nfuture orator. Wendell Phillips was in the class after him, and they both\nwere excellent speakers.",
        "Sumner’s early life was not like that of Lincoln, neither was he obliged\nto split rails for a living; but it was a life of good stoical training\nnevertheless. Sheriff Sumner had eight children living at one time, and\nwith the natural desire to give them as good an education as his own, he\ncould not afford to spend much on external elegances. It was not until\nCharles had become a distinguished lawyer that his mother dispensed with\nthe iron forks and spoons on her dinner table; and this gives a fair idea\nof their domestic economy. We learn from Pierce’s biography that his\ncollege expenses did not exceed two hundred dollars a year; and this\nincluded everything.",
        "He entered at Harvard in the class of 1830; a year after Doctor Holmes\nand a year before Wendell Phillips. Much more is known concerning his\ncollege life than that of other distinguished men of that time, and it is\nhighly interesting to recognize the mature man foreshadowed in the youth\nof eighteen. He was a good scholar in everything but mathematics; yet, at\nthe same time, he cared little for rank. He was an enthusiastic reader,\nand sometimes neglected his studies for a book in which he was more\ndeeply interested. He also liked to converse about the books he read, and\nin this way acquired a reputation for loquacity which never left him as\nlong as he lived. It was sometimes troublesome to his friends, but it was\nof great advantage to him as a public speaker. He lived a quiet, sober,\nindustrious life in college, attracting comparatively little attention\nfrom either his instructors or his fellow students. Yet, he showed the\nindependence of his character by attending a cattle-show at Brighton, a\nproceeding for which he would have been suspended if it had been\ndiscovered by the college faculty. There were many foolish, monkish\nrestrictions at Harvard in those days, and among them it was not\nconsidered decorous for a student to wear a colored vest. He might wear a\nwhite vest, but not a buff or a figured one. Sumner preferred a buff\nvest, and insisted on wearing it. When he was reprimanded for doing so he\ndefended his course vigorously, and exposed the absurdity of the\nregulation in such plain terms that the faculty concluded to let him\nalone for the future. [Footnote: In 1860 he still continued to wear a buff\nvest in summer weather.] He was exceedingly fond of the Greek and Latin\nauthors, and quoted from them in his letters at this time, as he did\nafterwards in his speeches. His college course was not a brilliant one\nlike Everett’s and Phillips’s, but seems to have been based on a more\nsolid ground-work.",
        "It was in the Law-School that Sumner first distinguished himself. Judge\nStory, who had left the United States Supreme Bench to become a Harvard\nprofessor, was the chief luminary of the school and the finest instructor\nin law of his time. He soon discovered in Sumner a pupil after his own\nheart, and in spite of the disparity of their ages they became intimate\nfriends. This is the more significant because Phillips was also in the\nsame class, and the more brilliant scholar of the two; but Judge Story\nsoon discovered that Phillips was studying as a means to an end, while\nSumner’s interest in the law was like that of a great artist who works\nfrom the pure love of his subject.",
        "William W. Story, who was a boy at this time, records the fact that\nSumner was always pleasant and kind to children.",
        "At the age of twenty-four Charles Sumner was himself appointed an\ninstructor at the Law-School; and during the two following years he\nedited the reports of Judge Story’s decisions in the United States\nCircuit Courts.",
        "It is evident from James Russell Lowell’s “Fable for Critics” that the\npersonalities of his contemporaries troubled him: he could not see over\ntheir heads. In 1837 Sumner went to Europe and we find from his letters\nto Judge Story, George S. Hillard, and others, that he had already\nobtained a vantage ground from which the civilized world lay before him,\nas all New England does from the top of Mount Washington. He goes into a\nFrench law court, and analyzes the procedure of French justice in a\nletter which has the value of an historical document. He noticed that\nNapoleon was still spoken of as l’Empereur, although there was a\nking in France,—a fact pregnant with future consequences. He remained in\nParis until he was a complete master of the French language, and attended\none hundred and fifty lectures at the university and elsewhere. He\nenjoyed the grand opera and the acting in French theatres; nor did he\nneglect to study Italian art. He was making a whole man of himself; and\nit seemed as if an unconscious instinct was guiding him to his destiny.",
        "Fortunate was the old Sheriff to have such a son; but Charles Sumner was\nalso fortunate to have had a father who was willing to save and economize\nfor his benefit. Otherwise he might have been a sheriff himself.",
        "Judge Story’s letters of introduction opened the doors wide to him in\nEngland. In the course of ten months he became acquainted with almost\nevery distinguished person in the United Kingdom. He never asked for\nintroductions, and he never presented himself without one. He was handed\nfrom one mansion to another all the way from London to the Scotch\nHighlands. Only twenty-seven years of age, he was treated on an equality\nby men ten to fifteen years his senior; and he proved himself equal to\ntheir expectations. No American except Lowell has ever made such a\nfavorable impression in England as Sumner; but this happened in Sumner’s\nyouth, while Lowell in his earlier visits attracted little attention.",
        "It is perfectly true that if he had been the son of an English sheriff\nthis would not have happened; but he encountered the same obstacles in\nBoston society that he would have done under similar conditions in Great\nBritain. The doors of Wentworth House and Strachan Park were open to him,\nbut those of Beacon Street were closed,—and perhaps it was better for\nhim on the whole that they were.",
        "Sumner’s letters from Europe are at least as interesting as those written\nby any other American. Such breadth of vision is not often united with\nclearness and accuracy of detail. All his letters ought to be published\nin a volume by themselves. Sumner returned to America the following year\nand settled himself quietly and soberly to his work as a lawyer. He was\nnot a success, however, as a practitioner in the courts, unless he could\nplead before a bench of judges. In the Common Pleas an ordinary\npettifogger would often take a case away from him. He could not, if he\nwould, have practised those seductive arts by which Rufus Choate drew the\njury into his net, in spite of their deliberate intentions to the\ncontrary. Yet, Sumner’s reputation steadily improved, so that when\nLongfellow came to live in Cambridge he found Sumner delivering lectures\nat the Harvard Law-School, where he might have remained the rest of his\nlife, if he had been satisfied with a merely routine employment, and the\nfortunes of the republic had not decided differently.",
        "The attraction between Sumner and Longfellow was immediate and permanent.\nIt was owing more perhaps to the essential purity of their natures, than\nto mutual sympathy in regard to art and literature; although Longfellow\nheld Sumner’s literary judgment in such respect that he rarely published\na new poem without first subjecting his work to Sumner’s criticism.",
        "Those who admired Sumner at this time, for his fine moral and\nintellectual qualities, had no adequate conception of the far nobler\nquality which lay concealed in the depths of his nature. Charles Sumner\nwas a hero,—one to whom life was nothing in comparison with his duty.",
        "It was in the anti-Irish riot of June, 1837, that he first gave evidence\nof this. Nothing was more hateful to him than race prejudice, and what\nmight be called international malignity, which he believed was the most\nfrequent cause of war.",
        "As soon as Sumner was notified of the disturbance, he hastened to the\nscene of action, seized on a prominent position, and attempted to address\nthe insurgents; but his pacific words only excited them to greater fury.\nThey charged on him and his little group of supporters, knocked him down\nand trampled on him. Dr. S. G. Howe, who stood near by, a born fighter,\nprotected Sumner’s prostrate body, and finally carried him to a place of\nsafety, although twice his own size. Sumner took his mishap very coolly,\nand, as soon as he could talk freely, addressed his friends on the evils\nresulting from race prejudice.",
        "This incident may have led Sumner to the choice of a subject for his\nFourth of July oration in 1845. The title of this address was “The True\nGrandeur of Nations,” but its real object was one which Sumner always had\nat heart, and never relinquished the hope of,—namely, the establishment\nof an international tribunal, which should possess jurisdiction over the\ndifferences and quarrels between nations, and so bring warfare forever to\nan end. The plan is an impracticable one, because the decisions of a\ncourt only have validity if it is able to enforce them, and how could the\ndecisions of an international tribunal have value in case the parties\nconcerned declined to accept them? It would only result in waging war in\norder to prevent war. Yet, of all the Fourth of July orations that were\ndelivered in the nineteenth century, Sumner’s and Webster’s are the only\ntwo that have survived; and the “True Grandeur of Nations” has recently\nbeen published by the London Peace Society as an argument in favor of\ntheir philanthropic movement.",
        "Sumner was now in the prime of manhood, and a rarely handsome man. He had\nan heroic figure, six feet two inches in height, and well proportioned in\nall respects. His features, too large and heavy in his youth, had become\nstrong and regular, and although he had not acquired that leonine look of\nreserved power with which he confronted the United States Senate, his\nexpression was frank and fearless. As L. Maria Child, who heard him\nfrequently, said, he seemed to be as much in his place on the platform as\na statue on its pedestal. His gestures had not the natural grace of\nPhillips’s or the more studied elegance of Everett, but he atoned for\nthese deficiencies by the manly earnestness of his delivery. He made\nan impression on the highly cultivated men and women who composed his\naudience which they always remembered.",
        "The question has often been raised by the older abolitionists, “Why did\nnot Sumner take an earlier interest in the anti-slavery struggle?” The\nanswer is twofold. That he did not join the Free-soilers in 1844 was most\nprobably owing to the influence of Judge Story, who had already marked\nSumner out for the Supreme Bench, and wished him to concentrate his\nenergies in that direction. His friends, too, at this time—Hillard,\nFelton, Liebe, and even Longfellow—were either opposed to introducing\nthe slavery question into politics or practically indifferent to it.",
        "On the other hand, Sumner never could agree with Garrison’s position on\nthis question. He held the Constitution in too great respect to admit\nthat it was an agreement with death and a government with the devil. He\nbelieved that the founders of the Constitution were opposed to slavery,\nand that the expression, “persons held to labor,” was good evidence of\nthis. One of his finest orations in the Senate was intended to prove this\npoint. Furthermore he perceived the futility of Garrison’s idea—and this\nwas afterwards disproved by the war—that if it were not for the National\nGovernment the slaves would rise in rebellion and so obtain their\nfreedom. He always asserted that slavery would be abolished under the\nConstitution or not at all. Like Abraham Lincoln he waited for his time\nto come.",
        "Charles Sumner was the reply that Massachusetts made to the Fugitive\nSlave Law, and a telling reply it was. Unlike his legal contemporaries he\nrecognized the law as a revolutionary act which, unless it was\nsuccessfully opposed, would strike a death-blow at American freedom. He\nsaw that it could only be met by counter-revolution, and he prepared his\nmind for the consequences. It was only at such a time that so\nuncompromising a statesman as Sumner could have entered into political\nlife; for the possibility of compromise had passed away with the\nsuspension of the writ of habeas corpus, and Sumner’s policy of\n\"no compromise” was the one which brought the slavery question to a\nsuccessful issue. For fifteen years in Congress he held to that policy as\nfaithfully as a planet to its course, and those who differed with him\nwere left in the rear.",
        "Sumner’s first difference was with his conservative friends, and\nespecially with his law-partner, George S. Hillard, a brilliant man in\nhis way, and for an introductory address without a rival in Boston.\nHillard was at heart as anti-slavery as Sumner, and his wife had even\nassisted fugitive slaves, but he was swathed in the bands of fashionable\nsociety, and he lacked the courage to break loose from them. He adhered\nto the Whigs and was relegated to private life. They parted without\nacrimony, and Sumner never failed to do his former friend a service when\nhe found an opportunity.",
        "His difference with Felton was of a more serious kind. Emerson, perhaps,\njudged Felton too severely,—a man of ardent temperament who was always\nin danger of saying more than he intended.",
        "Sumner’s election to the Senate was a chance in ten thousand. It is well\nknown that at first he declined to be a candidate. He did not think he\nwas fitted for the position, and when Caleb Gushing urged him to court\nthe favor of fortune he said: “I will not leave my chair to become United\nStates Senator.” Whatever vanity there might be in the man, he was\nentirely free from the ambition for power and place.",
        "There were several prominent public men at the time who would have given\nall they owned for the position, but they were set aside for the man who\ndid not want it,—the bold jurist who dared to set himself against the\nveteran statesmen of his country. It reads like a Bible-tale, or the\nstory of Cincinnatus taken from his plow to become dictator.",
        "The gates of his alma mater were now closed to Sumner, not only\nduring his life but even long after that. Such is the fate of\nrevolutionary characters, that they tear asunder old and familiar bonds\nin order to contract new ties. In Washington he found a broader and more\nvigorous life, if less cultivated, and the Free-soil leaders with whom he\nnow came in contact in his own State were much more akin to his own\nnature than Story, and Felton, and Hillard. Sumner was never popular in\nWashington, as he had been among the English liberals and Cambridge men\nof letters; but he was respected on all sides for his fearlessness, his\nability, and the veracity of his statements. His previous life now proved\na great advantage to him in most respects, but he had become accustomed\nto dealing and conversing with a certain class of men, and this made it\ndifficult for him to assimilate himself to a wholly different class.\nSumner’s ardent temperament required constant self-control in this new\nand trying position; and a man who continually reflects beforehand on his\nown actions acquires an appearance of greater reserve than a person of\nreally cold nature.",
        "Seward had thus far been the leader of the Free-soil and Republican\nparties, not only before the country at large but in the Senate. It was\nsoon found, however, that Sumner was not only a more effective speaker,\nbut possessed greater resources for debate. Judge Story had noticed long\nbefore that facts were so carefully and systematically arranged in\nSumner’s mind that whatever spring was touched he could always respond to\nthe subject with a full and exact statement. He was like a librarian who\ncould lay his hand on the book he wanted without having to look for it in\nthe catalogue,—and this upon a scale which seems almost incredible.\nWebster possessed the same faculty, but united it with a sense of\nartistic beauty which Sumner could not equal.",
        "Sumner, however, was the best orator in Congress at this time, as well as\nthe best legal authority. On all constitutional questions it was felt\nthat he had Judge Story’s support behind him. His oration on “Freedom\nNational, Slavery Sectional,” was a revelation, not only to the\nopposition, but to his own party. From that time forth, he became the\nspokesman of his party on all the more important questions.",
        "It frequently happens that the essential character of a government\nchanges while its form remains the same. In 1801 France was nominally a\nRepublic, but its administration was Imperial. In 1853 the United States\nceased to be a democracy and became an oligarchy, governed by thirty\nthousand slave-holders,—until the people reconquered their rights on the\nfield of battle. Accustomed to despotic power in their own States for\nmore than two generations, and justifying themselves always by divine\nright, the slave-holders possessed all the self-confidence, pretension,\nand arrogance of the old French nobility. They were a self-deluded class\nof men, of all classes the most difficult to deal with, and Sumner was\nthe Mirabeau who faced them at Washington and who pricked the bubble of\ntheir Olympian pretensions by a most pitiless exposure of their true\ncharacter.",
        "Those men had come to believe that the ownership of slaves was equivalent\nto a patent of nobility, and they were encouraged in this monarchical\nillusion by the nobility of Europe. In Disraeli’s “Lothair” an English\nduke is made to say: “I consider an American with large estates in the\nSouth a genuine aristocrat.” The pretension was ridiculous, and the only\nway to combat it was to make it appear so. Sumner characterized Butler,\nof South Carolina, and Douglas, of Illinois, who was their northern man\nof business, as the Don Quixote and Sancho Panza of an antiquated cause.\nThe satire hit its mark only too exactly; and two days later Sumner was\nassaulted for it in an assassin-like manner,—struck on the head from\nbehind while writing at his desk, and left senseless on the floor. Sumner\nwas considered too low in the social scale for the customary challenge to\na duel, and there was no court in Washington that would take cognizance\nof the outrage.",
        "The following day, when Wilson made the most eloquent speech of his life\nin an indignant rebuke to Butler and Brooks, Butler started from his seat\nto attack him, but was held back by his friends. They might as well have\nallowed him to go, for Wilson was a man of enormous strength and could\neasily have handled any Southerner upon the floor.",
        "In “The Crime against Kansas” there are two or three sentences which\nSumner afterwards expunged, and this shows that he regretted having said\nthem; but it is the greatest of his orations, and Webster’s reply to\nHayne is the only Congressional address with which it can be compared.\nOne is in fact the sequence of the other; Webster’s is the flower, and\nSumner’s the fruit; the former directed against the active principle of\nsedition, and the latter against its consequences; and both were directed\nagainst South Carolina, where the war originated. Sumner’s speech has not\nthe finely sculptured character of Webster’s, but its architectural\nstructure is grand and impressive. His Baconian division of the various\nexcuses that were made for the Kansas outrages into “the apology\ntyrannical, the apology imbecile, the apology absurd, and the apology\ninfamous,” was original and pertinent.",
        "Preston S. Brooks only lived about six months after his assault on\nSumner, and some of the abolitionists thought he died of a guilty\nconscience. Both in feature and expression he bore a decided likeness to\nJ. Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Lincoln. It might have proved\nthe death of Sumner, but for the devotion of his Boston physician, Dr.\nMarshall S. Perry, who went to him without waiting to be telegraphed for.\nIt was also fortunate for him that his brother George, a very intelligent\nman, happened to be in America instead of Europe, where he lived the\ngreater part of his life. The assault on Sumner strengthened the\nRepublican party, and secured his re-election to the Senate; but it\nproduced nervous irritation of the brain and spinal cord, a disorder\nwhich can only be cured under favorable conditions, and even then is\nlikely to return if the patient is exposed to a severe mental strain.\nSumner’s cure by Dr. Brown-Sequard was considered a remarkable one, and\nhas a place in the history of medicine. The effect of bromide and ergot\nwas then unknown, and the doctor made such good use of his cauterizing-\niron that on one occasion, at least, Sumner declared that he could not\nendure it any longer. Neither could he tell positively whether it was\nthis treatment or the baths which he afterwards took at Aix-les-Bains\nthat finally cured him. His own calm temperament and firmness of mind may\nhave contributed to this as much as Dr. Brown-Sequard.",
        "When Sumner returned to Boston, early in 1860, all his friends went to\nDr. S. G. Howe to know if he was really cured, and Howe said: “He is a\nwell man, but he will never be able to make another two hours’ speech.\"\nYet Sumner trained himself and tested his strength so carefully that in\nthe following spring he delivered his oration on the barbarism of\nslavery, more than an hour in length, before the Senate; and in 1863 he\nmade a speech three hours in length, a herculean effort that has never\nbeen equalled, except by Hamilton’s address before the Constitutional\nConvention of 1787.",
        "I remember Sumner in the summer of 1860 walking under my father’s grape\ntrellis, when the vines were in blossom, with his arms above his head,\nand saying: “This is like the south of France.” To think of Europe, its\nart, history, and scenery, was his relaxation from the cares and\nexcitement of politics; but there were many who did not understand this,\nand looked upon it as an affectation. Sumner in his least serious moments\nwas often self-conscious, but never affected. He talked of himself as an\ninnocent child talks. On all occasions he was thoroughly real and\nsincere, and he would sometimes be as much abashed by a genuine\ncompliment as a maiden of seventeen.",
        "At the same time Sumner was so great a man that it was simply impossible\nto disguise it, and he made no attempt to do this. The principle that all\nmen are created equal did not apply in his case. To realize this it was\nonly necessary to see him and Senator Wilson together. Wilson was also a\nman of exceptional ability, and yet a stranger, who did not know him by\nsight, might have conversed with him on a railway train without\nsuspecting that he was a member of the United States Senate; but this\ncould not have happened in Sumner’s case. Every one stared at him as he\nwalked the streets; and he could not help becoming conscious of this.\nThat there were moments when he seemed to reflect with satisfaction on\nhis past life his best friends could not deny; but the vanity that is\nborn of a frivolous spirit was not in him. He was more like a Homeric\nhero than a Sir Philip Sidney, and considering the work he had to do it\nwas better on the whole that he should be so.",
        "He carried the impracticable theory of social equality to an extent\nbeyond that of most Americans, and yet he was frequently complained of\nfor his reserve and aristocratic manners. The range of his acquaintance\nwas the widest of any man of his time. It extended from Lord Brougham to\nJ. B. Smith, the mulatto caterer of Boston, who, like many of his race,\nwas a person of gentlemanly deportment, and was always treated by Sumner\nas a valued friend. As the champion of the colored race in the Senate\nthis was diplomatically necessary; but to the rank and file of his own\nparty he was less gracious. He had not grown up among them, but had\nentered politics at the top, so that even their faces were unfamiliar to\nhim. The representatives of Massachusetts, who voted for him at the State\nHouse, were sometimes chagrined at the coldness of his recognition,—a\ncoldness that did not arise from lack of sympathy, but from ignorance of\nthe individual. Before Sumner could treat a stranger in a friendly\nmanner, he wished to know what sort of a person he had to deal with.\nThere is a kind of insincerity in universal cordiality,—like that of the\ncandidate who is seeking to obtain votes.",
        "A recent writer, who complains of Sumner’s lack of graciousness, would do\nwell to ask his conscience what the reason for it was. If he will drop\nthe three last letters of his own name the solution will be apparent to\nhim.",
        "The more Sumner became absorbed in public affairs the less he seemed to\nbe suited to general society,—or general society to him. He was always\nready to talk on those subjects that interested him, but in general\nconversation, in the pleasant give-and-take of wit and anecdote, he did\nnot feel so much at home as he had in his Cambridge days. His thoughts\nwere too serious, and the tendency of his mind was argumentative.",
        "Every man is to a certain extent the victim of his occupation; and the\nformalities of the Senate were ever tightening their grasp on Sumner’s\nmode of life. One afternoon, as he was leaving Dr. Howe’s garden at South\nBoston, the doctor’s youngest daughter ran out from the house, and called\nto him, “Good-bye, Mr. Sumner.” His back was already turned, but he faced\nabout like an officer on parade, and said with formal gravity: “Good\nevening, child,” so that Mrs. Howe could not avoid laughing at him. Yet\nSumner was fond of children in his youth. L. Maria Child heard of this\nincident and made good use of it in one of her story-books.",
        "The grand fact in Sumner’s character, however, rests beyond dispute that\nhe never aspired to the Presidency. That lingering Washington malady\nwhich victimized Clay, Webster, Calhoun, Seward, Chase, Sherman, and\nBlaine, and made them appear almost like sinners in torment, never\nattacked Sumner. He had accepted office as a patriotic duty, and, like\nWashington, he was ready to resign it whenever his work would be done.",
        "Sumner’s speech on the barbarism of slavery, timed as it was to meet the\nBaltimore convention, was evidently intended to drive a wedge into the\nsplit between the Northern and Southern Democrats, but it also must have\nencouraged the secession movement. Sumner, however, can hardly be blamed\nfor this, after the indignity he had suffered. That a high member of the\nGovernment could have been assaulted with impunity in open day indicated\na condition of affairs in the United States not unlike that of France at\nthe time when Count Toliendal was judicially murdered by Louis XV.\nWashington City was an oligarchical despotism.",
        "A dark cloud hung over the Republic during the winter of 1860-’61. The\nimpending danger was that war would break out before Lincoln could be\ninaugurated. Such secrecy was observed by the Republican leaders that\neven Horace Greeley could not fathom their intentions. Late in December\nJohn A. Andrew and George L. Stearns went to Washington to survey the\nground for themselves, and the latter wrote to William Robinson, “The\nwatchword is, keep quiet.” He probably obtained this from Sumner,\nand it gives the key to the whole situation.",
        "It demolishes Von Hoist’s finely-spun melodramatic theory in regard to\nthat period of our history, in which he finally compares the condition of\nthe United States to a drowning man who sees lurid flames before his\neyes. In the Republican and Union parties there were all shades of\ncompromise sentiment,—from those who were ready to sacrifice anything in\norder to prevent secession, to Abraham Lincoln, who was only willing to\nsurrender the barren and unpopulated State of New Mexico to the\nslaveholders. [Footnote: A not unreasonable proposition.] But Sumner,\nWade, Trumbull, Wilson, and King stood together like a rocky coast\nagainst which the successive waves of compromise dashed without effect.\nVon Hoist was notified of this fact years before the last volume of his\nhistory was published, but he disregarded it evidently because it\ninterfered with his favorite theory.",
        "The last of January, however, a report was circulated in Boston that\nSumner had joined the compromisers for the sake of consistency with the\npeace principles which he had advocated in his Fourth of July oration.\nBoston newspapers made the most of this, although it did not seem likely\nto Sumner’s friends, and George L. Stearns finally wrote to him for\npermission to make a denial of it. Sumner first replied to him by\ntelegraph saying: “I am against sending commissioners to treat of\nsurrender by the North. Stand firm.” Then he wrote him this memorable\nletter.",
        "WASHINGTON, 3d Feb., ’61.",
        "My Dear Sir:",
        "There are but few who stand rooted, like the oak, against a storm. This\nis the nature of man. Let us be patient.",
        "My special trust is this: No possible compromise or concession will be\nof the least avail. Events are hastening which will supersede all\nsuch things. This will save us. But I like to see Mass. in this breaking\nup of the Union ever true. God keep her from playing the part of Judas\nor—of Peter! You may all bend or cry pardon—I will not. Here I am, and\nI mean to stand firm to the last. God bless you!",
        "Ever yours,",
        "CHARLES SUMNER.",
        "The handwriting of this letter is magnificent. Sumner had a strongly\ncharacteristic hand with something of artistic grace in it, too; but in\nthis instance his writing seems like the external expression of the mood\nhe was in when he wrote the letter.",
        "The question may be asked, Why then did not Sumner rise in the Senate and\nmake one of his telling speeches against compromise during that long,\nwearisome session? I think the answer will be found in the watchword:\n\"Keep quiet!” He perfectly understood the game that Seward was playing\nand he was too wise to interfere with it. Seward was the cat and\ncompromise was the mouse. Whatever mistakes he may have afterwards made,\nSeward at this time showed a master hand. He encouraged compromise, but\nhe must have been aware that the proposed constitutional amendment, which\nwould forever have prevented legislation against slavery, would not have\nbeen confirmed by the Northern States. He could easily count the\nlegislatures that would reject it. It finally passed through Congress on\nthe last night of this session by a single vote, and was ratified by only\nthree States!",
        "As soon as Lincoln was inaugurated there was no more talk of compromise,\nand Seward was firmness itself. He declined to receive the disunion\ncommissioners; [Footnote: At the same time he coquetted with them\nunofficially.] he compelled the Secretary of War to reinforce Fort\nPickens; he overhauled General Scott, who proved an impediment to\nvigorous military operations. These facts tell their own tale.",
        "After Seward and Chase had left the Senate Sumner was facile\nprinceps. Trumbull was a vigorous orator and a rough-rider in debate,\nbut he did not possess the store of legal knowledge and the vast fund of\ngeneral information which Sumner could draw from. One has to read the\nfourth volume of Pierce’s biography to realize the dimensions of Sumner’s\nwork during the period from 1861 to 1869. Military affairs he never\ninterfered with, but he was Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs,\nthe most important in the Senate, and in the direction of home politics\nhe was second to none. No other voice was heard so often in the\nlegislative halls at Washington, and none heard with more respect. A list\nof the bills that he introduced and carried through would fill a long\ncolumn.",
        "The test of statesmanship is to change from the opposition to the\nleadership in a Government,—from critical to constructive politics. Carl\nSchurz was a fine orator and an effective speaker on the minority side,\nbut he commenced life as a revolutionist and always remained one. If he\nhad once attempted to introduce legislation, he would have shown his\nweakness, exactly where Sumner proved his strength. Froude says that to\nbe great in politics “is to recognize a popular movement, and to have the\ncourage and address to lead it\"; but three times Sumner planted his\nstandard away in advance of his party, and stood by it alone until his\nfollowers came up to him.",
        "He was always in advance of his party, but conspicuously so in regard to\nthe abolition of slavery, the exposure of Andrew Johnson’s perfidy, and\nthe reconstruction of the rebellious States. We might add the annexation\nof San Domingo as a fourth; for I believe there are few thinking persons\nat present who do not feel grateful to him for having saved the country\nfrom that uncomfortable acquisition.",
        "The bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia was introduced by\nWilson. Sumner did not like to be always proposing anti-slavery measures\nhimself, and he wished Wilson to have the honor of it. Wilson would not,\nof course, have introduced the measure without consulting his colleague.",
        "Lincoln evidently desired to enjoy the sole honor of issuing the\nEmancipation Proclamation of 1862, and he deserved to have it; but Sumner\nthought it might safely have been done after the battles of Fort\nDonaldson and Shiloh, and the victories of Foote and Farragut on the\nMississippi, six months before it was issued; and he urged to have it\ndone at that time. Whether his judgment was correct in this, it is\nimpossible to decide.",
        "Early in July, 1862, he introduced a bill in the Senate for the\norganization of the “contrabands” and other negroes into regiments,—a\npolicy suggested by Hamilton in 1780,—and no one can read President\nLincoln’s Message to Congress in December, 1864, without recognizing that\nit was only with the assistance of negro troops that the Union was\nfinally preserved.",
        "In spite of the continued differences between Sumner and Seward on\nAmerican questions they worked together like one man in regard to foreign\npolitics. Sumner’s experience in Europe and his knowledge of public men\nthere was much more extensive than Seward’s, and in this line he was of\ninvaluable assistance to the Secretary of State.",
        "Lowell could make a holiday of six years at the Court of St. James, but\nduring the war it was a serious matter to be Minister to England. In the\nsummer of 1863 affairs there had reached a climax. The Alabama and\nFlorida were scaring all American ships from the ocean, and five\nironclad rams, built for the confederate government, were nearly ready to\nput to sea from English ports. If this should happen it seemed likely\nthat they would succeed in raising the blockade. As a final resort\nLincoln and Seward sent word to Adams to threaten the British Government\nwith war unless the rams were detained.",
        "Meanwhile it was necessary to brace up the American people to meet the\npossible emergency. On September 10 Sumner addressed an audience of three\nthousand persons in Cooper Institute, New York, for three hours on the\nforeign relations of the United States; and there were few who left the\nhall before it was finished. He arraigned the British Government for its\ninconsistency, its violation of international law, and its disregard of\nthe rights of navigators. It was not only a heroic effort, but a self-\nsacrificing one; for Sumner knew that it would separate him forever from\nthe larger number of his English friends.",
        "At the same time Minister Adams had an equally difficult task before him.\nWar with England seemed to be imminent. He held a long consultation with\nBenjamin Moran, the Secretary of Legation, and they finally concluded to\nsee if an opinion could be obtained on the confederate rams from an\nEnglish legal authority. They went to Sir Robert Colyer, one of the lords\nof the admiralty, and asked him if he was willing to give them an\nopinion. He replied that he considered the law above politics, and that\nhe wished to do what was right. After investigating the subject Colyer\nmade a written statement to the effect that the United States was wholly\njustified in demanding detention of the rams. Adams then placed this\nopinion together with Lincoln’s notification before the British Cabinet,\nbut the papers were returned to him with a refusal of compliance. “There\nis nothing now,” said Adams to Moran, “but for us to pack up and go\nhome\"; but Moran replied, “Let us wait a little; while there is life\nthere is hope\"; and the same evening Adams was notified that Her\nMajesty’s Government still had the subject under consideration. The rams\nproved a dead loss.",
        "When Benjamin Moran related this incident to the Philadelphia Hock Club\nafter his return, he added: “We owe it to our Irish-American citizens as\nmuch as to the monitors that we did not suffer from English\ninterference.”",
        "Seward, and also Chase, wished to issue letters of reprisal to privateers\nto go in search of the Alabama, but Sumner opposed this in an able\nspeech on the importance of maintaining a high standard of procedure for\nthe good reputation of the country; and he carried his point.",
        "Sumner’s greatest parliamentary feat was occasioned by Trumbull’s\nintroduction of a bill for the reconstruction of Louisiana in the winter\nof 1864. There were only ten thousand loyal white voters in the State;\nand nothing could be more imprudent or prejudicial than such a hasty\nattempt at reorganization of the rebellious South, before the war was\nfairly ended. It was like a man building an annex to one side of his\nhouse while the other side was on fire; yet it was known to be supported\nby Seward, and, as was alleged, also by Lincoln. It was thrust upon\nCongress at the last moment, evidently in order to prevent an extended\ndebate, and Sumner turned this to his own advantage. For two days and\nnights his voice resounded through the Senate chamber, until, with the\nassistance of his faithful allies, Wade and Wilson, he succeeded in\npreventing the bill from being brought to a vote. It was an extreme\ninstance of human endurance, without parallel before or since, and may\npossibly have shortened Sumner’s life. Five weeks later President\nLincoln, in his last speech, made the significant proposition of\nuniversal amnesty combined with universal suffrage. Would that he could\nhave lived to see the completion of his work!",
        "Something may be said here of Sumner’s influence with Mrs. Lincoln. If\nDon Piatt is to be trusted, Mrs. Lincoln came to Washington with a\nstrong feeling of antipathy towards Seward and “those eastern\nabolitionists.” She was born in a slave state and had remained pro-\nslavery,—a fact which did not trouble her husband because he did not\nallow it to trouble him. Fifteen months in Washington brought a decided\nchange in her opinions, and Sumner would seem to have been instrumental\nin this conversion. It is well known that she preferred his society to\nthat of others. She had studied French somewhat, and he encouraged her to\ntalk it with him,—which was looked upon, of course, as an affectation on\nboth sides.",
        "At the time of General McClellan’s removal, October, 1862, Mrs. Lincoln\nwas at the Parker House in Boston. Sumner called on her in the forenoon,\nand she said at once: “I suppose you have heard the news, and that you\nare glad of it. So am I. Mr. Lincoln told me he expected to remove him\nbefore I left Washington.”",
        "Sumner resembled Charles XII. of Sweden in this: there is no evidence\nthat he ever was in love. His devotion to the law in early life,\nsurrounded as he was by interesting friends, may have been antagonistic\nto matrimony. The woman he ought to have married was the noble daughter\nof his old friend, Cornelius Felton, whom he often met, but whose worth\nhe never recognized. The marriage which he contracted late in life was\nnot based on enduring principles, and soon came to a grievous end. It was\nmore like the marriages that princes make than a true republican\ncourtship. Sumner apparently wanted a handsome wife to preside at his\ndinner parties in Washington, but he chose her from among his opponents\ninstead of from among his friends.",
        "Since there has been much foolish talk upon this subject, it may be well\nto state here that the true difficulty between Mr. and Mrs. Sumner was\nowing to the company which he invited to his house. She only wished to\nentertain fashionable people, but a large proportion of Sumner’s friends\ncould not be included within these narrow limits. As Senator from\nMassachusetts that would not do for him at all. This is the explanation\nthat was given by Mrs. Sumner’s brother, and it is without doubt the\ncorrect one; but women in such cases are apt to allege something\ndifferent from the true reason.",
        "Sumner’s most signal triumph happened on the occasion of President\nJohnson’s first Message to Congress in January, 1865. He rose from his\nseat and characterized it as a “whitewashing document.” That day he stood\nalone, yet within six weeks every Republican Senator was at his side.",
        "Sumner knew how to be silent as well as to talk. On one occasion he was\nmaking a speech in the Senate when he suddenly heard Schuyler Colfax\nbehind him saying, “This is all very good, Sumner, but here I have the\nAppropriation bills from the House, and the Democrats know nothing about\nthem.” Sumner instantly resumed his seat, and the bills were acted on\nwithout serious opposition. He would sometimes sit through a dinner at\nthe Bird Club without saying very much, but if he once started on a\nsubject that interested him there was no limit to it.",
        "Sumner’s speech on the “Alabama claims” was considered a failure because\nthe administration did not afterwards support him; and it is true that no\ngovernment would submit to a demand for adventitious damages so long as\nit could prevent this; but it was a far-reaching exposure of an\nunprincipled foreign policy, and this speech formed the groundwork for\nthe Treaty of Washington and the Geneva arbitration. It was a more\nimportant case than the settlement of the Northeastern boundary.",
        "Sumner died the death of a hero. The administration of General Grant\nmight well be called the recoil of the cannon: it was the reactionary\neffect of a great military movement on civil affairs. Sumner alone\nwithstood the shock of it, and he fought against it for four years like a\nveteran on his last line of defence, feeling victory was no longer\npossible. Many of his friends found the current too strong for them; his\nown party deserted him; even the Legislature of his own State turned\nagainst him in a senseless and irrational manner. Still his spirit was\nunconquerable, and he continued to face the storm as long as life was in\nhim. It was a magnificent spectacle.",
        "It was the last battlefield of a veteran warrior, and although Sumner\nretired from it with a mortal wound, he had the satisfaction of winning a\nglorious victory. No end could have been more appropriate to such a life.\nDulce et decorum est pro patria mori.",
        "Since Richard Coeur de Leon forgave Bertram de Gordon, who caused his\ndeath, there has never been a more magnanimous man than Charles Sumner.\nOnce when L. Maria Child was anathematizing Preston S. Brooks in his\npresence, he said: “You should not blame him. It was slavery and not\nBrooks that struck me. If Brooks had been born and brought up in New\nEngland, he would no more have done the thing he did than Caleb Cushing\nwould have done it,\"—Cushing always being his type of a pro-slavery\nYankee.",
        "In 1871 Charles W. Slack, the editor of the Boston Commonwealth,\nfor whom Sumner had obtained a lucrative office, turned against his\nbenefactor in order to save his position. When I spoke of this to Sumner,\nhe said: “Well, it is human nature. Slack is growing old, and if he keeps\nhis office for the next six years, he will have a competency. I have no\ndoubt he feels grateful to me, and regrets the course he is taking.” At\nthe same time, he spoke sadly.",
        "Sumner resembled Lord Chatham more closely than any statesman of the\nnineteenth century. He carried his measures through by pure force of\nargument and clearness of foresight. From 1854 to 1874 it was his policy\nthat prevailed in the councils of the nation. He succeeded where others\nfailed.",
        "He defeated Franklin Pierce, Seward, Trumbull, Andrew Johnson, Hamilton\nFish, and even Lincoln, on the extradition of Mason and Slidell. He tied\nJohnson down, so that he could only move his tongue.",
        "In considering Sumner’s oratory, we should bear in mind what Coleridge\nsaid to Allston, the painter,—\"never judge a work of art by its\ndefects.” His sentences have not the classic purity of Webster’s, and his\ndelivery lacked the ease and elegance of Phillips and Everett. His style\nwas often too florid and his Latin quotations, though excellent in\nthemselves, were not suited to the taste of his audiences. But Sumner was\nalways strong and effective, and that is, after all, the main point. Like\nWebster he possessed a logical mind, and the profound earnestness of his\nnature gave an equally profound conviction to his words. Besides this,\nSumner possessed the heroic element, as Patrick Henry and James Otis\npossessed it. After Webster’s death there was no American speaker who\ncould hold an audience like him.",
        "Matthew Arnold, in his better days, said that Burke’s oratory was too\nrich and overloaded. This is true, but it is equally true that Burke is\nthe only orator of the eighteenth century that still continues to be\nread. He had a faulty delivery and an ungainly figure, but if he emptied\nthe benches in the House of Commons he secured a larger audience in\ncoming generations. The material of his speeches is of such a vital\nquality that it possesses a value wholly apart from the time and occasion\nof its delivery.",
        "Much the same is true of Sumner, who would have had decidedly the\nadvantage of Burke so far as personal impressiveness is concerned. His\nPhi Beta Kappa address of 1845 is so rich in material that it is even\nmore interesting to read now than when it was first delivered, and his\nremarks on Allston in that oration might be considered to advantage by\nevery art critic in the country. It should always be remembered that a\nspeech, like a play, is written not to be read, but to be acted; and\nthose discourses which read so finely in the newspapers are not commonly\nthe ones that sounded the best when they were delivered.",
        "Great men create great antagonisms. The antagonism which Lincoln excited\nwas concentrated in Booth’s pistol shot, and the Montagues and Capulets\nbecame reconciled over his bier; but the antagonism against Sumner still\ncontinues to smoke and smoulder like the embers of a dying conflagration.",
        "The finest modern statue in Berlin is that of General Ziethen, the great\nHussar commander in the Seven Years’ War. [Footnote: Von Schlater’s\nstatue of the Great Elector is of course a more magnificent work of art.]\nHe stands leaning on his sabre in a dreamy, nonchalant attitude, as if he\nwere in the centre of indifference and life had little interest for him.\nYet there never was a man more ready for action, or more quick to seize\nupon and solve the nodus of any new emergency. The Prussian\nanecdote-books are full of his exploits and hairbreadth escapes, a number\nof which are represented around the base of the statue. He combined the\nintelligence of the skilful general with the physical dexterity of an\nacrobat.",
        "Very much such a man was Samuel Gridley Howe, born in Boston November 10,\n1801, whom Whittier has taken as the archetype of an American hero in his\ntune.",
        "If a transient guest at the Bird Club should have seen Doctor Howe\nsitting at the table with his indifferent, nonchalant air, head leaning\nslightly forward and his grayish-black hair almost falling into his eyes,\nhe would never have imagined that he was the man who had fought the Turks\nhand-to-hand like Cervantes and Sir John Smith; who had been imprisoned\nin a Prussian dungeon; who had risked his life in the July Revolution at\nParis; and who had taken the lead in an equally important philanthropic\nrevolution in his own country.",
        "Next to Sumner he is the most distinguished member of the club, even more\nso than Andrew and Wilson; a man with a most enviable record. He does not\ntalk much where many are gathered together, but if he hears an imprudent\nstatement, especially an unjust estimate of character, his eyes flash out\nfrom beneath the bushy brows, and he makes a correction which just hits\nthe nail on the head. He is fond of his own home and is with difficulty\nenticed away from it. Once in awhile he will dash out to Cambridge on\nhorseback to see Longfellow, but the lion-huntresses of Boston spread\ntheir nets in vain for him. He will not even go to the dinner parties for\nwhich Mrs. Howe is in constant demand, but prefers to spend the evening\nwith his children, helping them about their school lessons, and listening\nto the stories of their everyday experiences.",
        "There never was a more modest, unostentatious hero; and no one has\nrecorded his hairbreadth escapes and daring adventures, for those who\nwitnessed them never told the tale, nor would Doctor Howe willingly speak\nof them himself. He was of too active a temperament to be much of a\nscholar in his youth, although in after life he went through with\nwhatever he undertook in a thorough and conscientious manner. He went to\nBrown University, and appears to have lived much the same kind of life\nthere which Lowell did at Harvard,—full of good spirits, admired by his\nclassmates, as well as by the young ladies of Providence, and\nexceptionally fond of practical jokes; always getting into small\ndifficulties and getting out of them again with equal facility. He was so\namiable and warm-hearted that nobody could help loving him; and so it\ncontinued to the end of his life.",
        "He could not himself explain exactly why he joined the Greek Revolution.\nHe had suffered himself while at school from the tyranny of older boys,\nand this strengthened the sense of right and justice that had been\nimplanted in his nature. He had not the romantic disposition of Byron;\nneither could he have gone from a desire to win the laurels of Miltiades,\nfor he never indicated the least desire for celebrity. It seems more\nlikely that his adventurous disposition urged him to it, as one man takes\nto science and another to art.",
        "It was certainly a daring adventure to enlist as a volunteer against the\nTurks. Byron might expect that whatever advantage wealth and reputation\ncan obtain for an individual he could always count upon; but what chances\nwould young Howe have in disaster or defeat? I never heard that Byron did\nmuch fighting, though he spent his fortune freely in the cause; and\nDoctor Howe, as it happened, was not called upon to fight in line of\nbattle, though he was engaged in some pretty hot skirmishes and risked\nhimself freely.",
        "He went to Greece in the summer of 1824 and remained till after the\nbattle of Navarino in 1827. Greece was saved, but the land was a desert\nand its people starving. Doctor Howe returned to America to raise funds\nand beg provisions for liberated Hellas, in which he was remarkably\nsuccessful; but we find also that he published a history of the Greek\nRevolution, the second edition of which is dated 1828. For this he must\nhave collected the materials before leaving Greece; but as it contains an\naccount of the sea-fight of Navarino, it must have been finished after\nhis return to America. The book was hastily written, and hastily\npublished. To judge from appearances it was hurried through the press\nwithout being revised either by its author or a competent proofreader;\nbut it is a vigorous, spirited narrative, and the best chronicle of that\nperiod in English. Would there were more such histories, even if the\nwriting be not always grammatical. Doctor Howe does not sentimentalize\nover the ruins of Sparta or Plato’s Academy, but he describes Greece as\nhe found it, and its inhabitants as he knew them. He possesses what so\nmany historians lack, and that is the graphic faculty. He writes in a\nbetter style than either Motley or Bancroft. His book ought to be revised\nand reprinted.",
        "We quote from it this clearsighted description of the preparation for a\nGraeco-Turkish sea-fight:",
        "    “Soon the proud fleet of the Capitan Pashaw was seen coming down\n    toward Samos, and the Greek vessels advanced to meet it. And here\n    one cannot but pause a moment to compare the two parties, and\n    wonder at the contrast between them. On one side bore down a long line\n    of lofty ships whose very size and weight seemed to give them\n    a slow and stately motion; completely furnished at every point for\n    war; their decks crowded with splendidly armed soldiers, and their\n    sides chequered with double and triple-rows of huge cannon that it\n    seemed could belch forth a mass of iron which nothing could resist.\n    On the other side came flying along the waves a squadron of light\n    brigs and schooners, beautifully modelled, with sails of snowy white,\n    and with fancifully painted sides, showing but a single row of\n    tiny cannon. There seemed no possibility of a contest; one fleet\n    had only to sail upon the other, and by its very weight, bear the\n    vessels under water without firing a gun.",
        "    “But the feelings which animated them were very different. The Turks\n    were clumsy sailors; they felt ill at ease and as if in a new\n    element; but above all, they felt a dread of Greek fire-ships,\n    which made them imagine every vessel that approached them to be\n    one. The Greeks were at home on the waves,—active and fearless\n    mariners, they knew that they could run around a Turkish frigate\n    and not be injured; they knew the dread their enemies had of\n    fire-ships, and they had their favorite, the daring Kanaris, with\n    them.”",
        "The heroic deeds of the modern Greeks fully equalled those of the\nancients; and the death of Marco Bozzaris was celebrated in all the\nlanguages of western Europe. William Muller, the German poet, composed a\nvolume of fine lyrics upon the incidents of the Greek Revolution; so that\nafter his death the Greek Government sent a shipload of marble to Germany\nfor the construction of his monument.",
        "One day Doctor Howe, with a small party of followers, was anchored in a\nyawl off the Corinthian coast, when a Turk crept down to the shore and\ncommenced firing at them from behind a large tree. After he had done this\ntwice, the doctor calculated where he would appear the third time, and\nfiring at the right moment brought him down with his face to the earth.\nDoctor Howe often fired at Turks in action, but this was the only one\nthat he felt sure of having killed; and he does not appear to have even\ncommunicated the fact to his own family.",
        "After Doctor Howe’s triumphant return to Greece with a cargo of\nprovisions in 1828 he was appointed surgeon-general of the Greek navy,\nand finally, as a reward for all his services, he received a present of\nByron’s cavalry helmet,—certainly a rare trophy. [Footnote: This helmet\nhung for many years on the hat tree at Dr. Howe’s house in South Boston.]",
        "Doctor Howe’s mysterious imprisonment in Berlin in 1832 is the more\nenigmatical since Berlin has generally been the refuge of the oppressed\nfrom other European countries. The Huguenots, expelled by Louis XIV.,\nwent to Berlin in such numbers that they are supposed by Menzel to have\nmodified the character of its inhabitants. The Salzburg refugees were\nwelcomed in Prussia by Frederick William I., who had an official hanged\nfor embezzling funds that were intended for their benefit. In 1770\nFrederick the Great gave asylum to the Jesuits who had been expelled from\nevery Catholic capital in Europe; and when the brothers Grimm and other\nprofessors were banished from Cassel for their liberalism, they were\nreceived and given positions by Frederick William IV. Why then should the\nPrussian government have interfered with Doctor Howe, after he had\ncompleted his philanthropic mission to the Polish refugees? Why was he\nnot arrested in the Polish camp when he first arrived there?",
        "The futile and tyrannical character of this proceeding points directly to\nMetternich, who at that time might fairly be styled the Tiberias of\nGermany. The Greek Revolution was hateful to Metternich, and he did what\nhe could to prevent its success. His intrigues in England certainly\ndelayed the independence of Greece for two years and more. He foresaw\nclearly enough that its independence would be a constant annoyance to the\nAustrian government,—and so it has proved down to the present time.\nMetternich imagined intrigues and revolution in every direction; and\nbesides, there can be no doubt of the vindictiveness of his nature. The\ncunning of the fox is not often combined with the supposed magnanimity of\nthe lion.",
        "The account of his arrest, which Doctor Howe gave George L. Stearns,\ndiffers very slightly from that in Sanborn’s biography. According to the\nformer he persuaded the Prussian police, on the ground of decency, to\nremain outside his door until he could dress himself. In this way he\ngained time to secrete his letters. He tore one up and divided the small\npieces in various places. While he was doing this he noticed a bust of\nsome king of Prussia on top of the high porcelain stove which forms a\npart of the furniture of every large room in Berlin. Concluding it must\nbe hollow he tipped it on edge and inserted the rest of his letters\nwithin. The police never discovered this stratagem, but they searched his\nroom in the most painstaking manner, collecting all the pieces of the\nletter he had torn up, so that they read every word of it. Whether his\nletters were really of a compromising character, or he was only afraid\nthat they might be considered so, has never been explained.",
        "The day after his arrest he was brought before a tribunal and asked a\nmultitude of questions, which he appears to have answered willingly\nenough; and a week or more later the same examiners made a different set\nof inquiries of him, all calculated to throw light upon his former\nanswers. Doctor Howe admitted afterwards that if he had attempted to\ndeceive them they would certainly have discovered the fact. He was in\nprison five weeks, for which the Prussian government had the impudence to\ncharge him board; and why President Jackson did not demand an apology and\nreparation for this outrage on a United States citizen is not the least\nmysterious part of the affair.",
        "A good Samaritan does not always find a good Samaritan. After his return\nto Paris Doctor Howe went to England, but was taken so severely ill on\nthe way that he did not know what might have become of him but for an\nEnglish passenger with whom he had become acquainted and who carried him\nto his own house and cared for him until he was fully recovered. This\nexcellent man, name now forgotten, had a charming daughter who materially\nassisted in Howe’s convalescence, and he said afterwards that if he had\nnot been strongly opposed to matrimony at that time she would probably\nhave become his wife. He was not married until ten years later; but he\nalways remembered this incident as one of the pleasantest in his life.",
        "The true hero never rests on his laurels. Doctor Howe had no sooner\nreturned from Europe than he set himself to work on a design he had\nconceived in Paris for the instruction of the blind. Next to Doctor\nMorton’s discovery of etherization, there has been no undertaking equal\nto this for the amelioration of human misery. He brought the best methods\nfrom Europe, and improved upon them. Beginning at first in a small way,\nand with such means as he could obtain from the merchants of Boston, he\nwent on to great achievements. He had the most difficulty in dealing with\nlegislative appropriations and enactments, for as he was not acquainted\nwith the ruling class in Massachusetts, they consequently looked upon him\nwith suspicion. He not only made the plan, but he carried it out; he\norganized the institution at South Boston and set the machinery in\nmotion.",
        "The story of Laura Bridgman is a tale told in many languages. The deaf\nand blind girl whom Doctor Howe taught to read and to think soon\nbecame as celebrated as Franklin or Webster. She was between seven and\neight years old when he first discovered her near Hanover, N. H., and for\nfive years and a half she had neither seen nor heard. It is possible that\nshe could remember the external world in a dim kind of way, and she must\nhave learned to speak a few words before she lost her hearing. Doctor\nHowe taught her the names of different objects by pasting them in raised\nletters on the objects about her, and he taught her to spell by means of\nseparate blocks with the letters upon them. She then was taught to read\nafter the usual method of instructing the blind, and communicated with\nher fingers after the manner of deaf mutes. Doctor Howe said in his\nreport of the case:",
        "“Hitherto, the process had been mechanical, and the success about as\ngreat as teaching a very knowing dog a variety of tricks. The poor child\nhad sat in mute amazement and patiently imitated everything her teacher\ndid; but now the truth began to flash upon her; her intellect began to\nwork; she perceived that here was a way by which she could herself make\nup a sign of anything that was in her own mind, and show it to another\nmind, and at once her countenance lighted up with a human expression; it\nwas no longer a dog or parrot,—it was an immortal spirit, eagerly\nseizing upon a new link of union with other spirits!”",
        "Finally she was educated in the meaning of the simplest abstract terms\nlike right and wrong, happy and sad, crooked and straight, and in this\nshe evinced great intelligence, for she described being alone as all\none, and being together all two,—the original meaning of\nalone and altogether, which few persons think of. In trying to express\nherself where she found some difficulty she made use of agglutinative\nforms of speech. [Footnote: Like the Aztecs, Kanackers and other\nprimitive races.]",
        "The education of Laura has rare value as a psychological study; for it\nproves incontestably that mind is a thing in itself, and not merely a\ncombination of material forces, as the philosophers of our time would\nhave us believe. Laura Bridgman’s mind was there, though wholly unable to\nexpress itself, and so soon as the magic key was turned, she developed as\nrapidly and intelligently as other girls of her age. She soon became much\nmore intelligent than the best trained dog who has all his senses in an\nacute condition; and she developed a sensibility toward those about her\nsuch as Indian or Hottentot girls of the same age would not have done at\nall. She soon began to indicate that sense of order which is the first\nstep on the stairway of civilization. If these qualities had not been in\nher they never could have come out.",
        "Why is it that so many superior women remain unmarried, and why do men of\nsuperior intellect and exceptional character so often mate themselves\nwith weak or narrow-minded women? That a diffident man, with a taste for\nplaying on the flute, should be captured by a virago, is not so\nremarkable,—that is his natural weakness; but it is also true that the\nworthiest man often chooses indifferently. This thing they call matrimony\nis in fact like diving for pearls: you bring up the oyster, but what it\ncontains does not appear until afterward. A friend of Sumner, who\nimagined his wife had a beautiful nature because she was fond of wild-\nflowers, discovered too late that she cared more for botany than for her\nhusband.",
        "Chevalier Howe met with better fortune. He waited long and to good\npurpose. It was fitting that such a man should marry a poetess; and he\nfound her, not in her rose-garden or some romantic sylvan retreat, but in\nthe city of New York. Miss Julia Ward was the daughter, as she once\nstyled herself, of the Bank of Commerce, but her mind was not bent on\nmoney or a fashionable life. She was graceful, witty and charming in the\ndrawing-room; but there was also a serious vein in her nature which could\nonly be satisfied by earnest thought and study. She went from one book to\nanother through the whole range of critical scholarship, disdaining\neverything that was not of the best quality. She soon knew so much that\nthe young men became afraid of her, but she cared less for their\nadmiration than for her favorite authors. Above all, the deep religious\nvein in her nature, which never left her, served as a balance to her\nromantic disposition. Her first admirer is said to have been an eloquent\npreacher who came to New York while Miss Ward was in her teens.",
        "Another man might have crossed Julia Ward’s path and only have remembered\nher as a Sumner friend. Doctor Howe recognized the opportunity, and had\nno intention of letting it slip. His reputation and exceptional character\nattracted her; and he wooed and won her with the same courage that he\nfought the Greeks. Her sister married Crawford, the best sculptor of his\ntime, whom Sumner helped to fame and fortune.",
        "Doctor Howe’s wedding journey, which included a complete tour of Europe,\nseems to have been the first rest that he had taken in twenty years. Such\nwedding journeys are frequent enough now, but it is a rare bride that\nfinds the doors of distinguished houses opened to her husband from\nEdinburgh to Athens. Was it not a sufficient reward for any man’s service\nto humanity?",
        "For that matter Doctor Howe’s lifelong work received comparatively slight\nrecognition or reward. A few medals were sent to him from Europe,—a gold\none from the King of Prussia,—and he was always looked upon in Boston\nas a distinguished citizen; but his vocation at the Blind Asylum withdrew\nhim from the public eye, and the public soon forgets what happened\nyesterday. What a blaze of enthusiasm there was for Admiral Dewey in\n1899, and how coldly his name was received as a presidential candidate\none year later!",
        "Doctor Howe was once nominated for Congress as a forlorn hope, and his\nname was thrice urged unavailingly for foreign appointments. He certainly\ndeserved to be made Minister to Greece, but President Johnson looked upon\nhim as a very “ultra man”,—the real objection being no doubt that he was\na friend of Sumner, and the second attempt made by Sumner himself was\ndefeated by Hamilton Fish. Doctor Howe was fully qualified at any time to\nbe Minister to France, and as well qualified as James Russell Lowell for\nthe English Mission; but the appointment of such men as Lowell and Howe\nhas proved to be a happy accident rather than according to the natural\norder of events. What reward did Doctor Morton ever obtain, until twenty-\nfive years after his death his name was emblazoned in memorial hall of\nBoston State House! It is an old story.",
        "Yet Doctor Howe may well be considered one of the most fortunate\nAmericans of his time. Lack of public appreciation is the least evil that\ncan befall a man of truly great spirit,—unless indeed it impairs the\nusefulness of his work, and Edward Everett, who had sympathized so\ncordially with Doctor Howe’s efforts in behalf of the Greeks, could also\nhave told him sympathetically that domestic happiness was fully as\nvaluable as public honor. Fortunate is the man who has wandered much over\nthe earth and seen great sights, only the better to appreciate the quiet\nand repose of his own hearth-stone! The storm and stress period of Doctor\nHowe’s life was over, and henceforth it was to be all blue sky and smooth\nsailing.",
        "Sumner expressed a kind of regret at Doctor Howe’s marriage,—a regret\nfor his own loneliness; but he found afterwards that instead of losing\none friend he had made another. His visits to South Boston were as\nfrequent as ever, and he often brought distinguished guests with him,—\nEnglish, French, and German. There was no lady in Boston whom he liked to\nconverse with so well as Mrs. Howe; and if he met her on the street he\nwould almost invariably stop to speak with her a few minutes. He\nsometimes suffered from the keen sallies of her wit, but he accepted this\nas part of the entertainment, and once informed her that if she were\npresident of the Senate it would be much better for the procedure of the\npublic business.",
        "George Sumner also came; like his brother, a man much above the average\nin general ability, and considered quite equal to the Delivery of a\nFourth of July oration. He was the more entertaining talker of the two,\nand in other respects very much like Tom Appleton,—better known on the\nParis boulevards than in his native country. Instead of being witty like\nAppleton he was brilliantly encyclopaedic; and they both carried their\nstatements to the verge of credibility.",
        "Doctor Howe organized the blind asylum so that it almost ran itself\nwithout his oversight, and as always happens in such cases he was\nidolized by those who were under his direction. There was something\nexceedingly kind in his tone of voice,—a voice accustomed to command and\nyet much subdued. His manner towards children was particularly charming\nand attractive. He exemplified the lines in Emerson’s “Wood-notes”:",
        "applied to Doctor Howe more completely than to the person for whom they\nwere originally intended; for Thoreau’s bachelor habits and isolated mode\nof life prevented him from being an attractive person to the generality\nof mankind.",
        "It was said of James G. Blaine that he left every man he met with\nthe impression that he was his best friend. This may have been well\nintended, but it has the effect of insincerity, for the thing is\npractically impossible. The true gentleman has always a kind manner, but\nhe does not treat the man whom he has just been introduced to as a\nfriend; he waits for that until he shall know him better. It is said of\nAmericans generally that they are generous and philanthropic, but that\nthey do not make good friends,—that their idea of friendship depends too\nmuch on association and the influence of mutual interests, instead of the\nunderlying sense of spiritual relationship. When they cease to have\nmutual interests the friendship is at an end, or only continues to exist\non paper. Doctor Howe was as warm-hearted as he was firm-hearted, but he\nnever gave his full confidence to any one until he had read him through\nto the backbone. His friends were so fond of him that they would go any\ndistance to see him. His idea of friendship seemed to be like that of the\nfriends in the sacred band of Thebes, whose motto was either to avenge\ntheir comrades on the field of battle or to die with them.",
        "He did not like a hypocritical morality, which he said too often resulted\nin the hypocritical sort. He complained of this in Emerson’s teaching,\nwhich he thought led his readers to scrutinize themselves too closely as\nwell as to be too censorious of others; and he respected Emerson more for\nhis manly attitude on the Kansas question than for anything he wrote.",
        "He always continued to be the chevalier. He was like Hawthorne’s gray-\nhaired champion, who always came to the front in a public emergency, and\nthen disappeared, no one knew whither. When the Bond Street riot took\nplace in 1837, there was Doctor Howe succoring the oppressed; in 1844 he\njoined the Conscience Whigs and was one of the foremost among them; he\nhelped materially toward the election of Sumner in 1851, and for years\nafterwards was a leader in the vigilance committee organized to resist\nthe Fugitive Slave law. He stood shoulder to shoulder with George L.\nStearns in organizing resistance to the invasions of Kansas by the\nMissourians; and again in 1862 when Harvard University made its last\ndesperate political effort in opposition to Lincoln’s Emancipation\nProclamation; but when his friends and his party came into power Howe\nneither asked nor hinted at any reward for his brilliant services.",
        "Edward L. Pierce, the biographer of Sumner, was not above exhibiting his\nprejudices as to certain members of the Bird Club, both by what he has\nwritten and what he neglected to write. He says of the Chevalier: “Dr.\nHowe, who had a passion for revolutions and civil disturbances of all\nkinds, and had no respect for the restrictions of international law or\ncomity, was vexed with Sumner for not promoting the intervention of the\nUnited States in behalf of the insurgent Cubans.”",
        "This reminds one of Boswell’s treatment of Doctor Johnson’s friends. Like\nJohn Adams and Hampden, Doctor Howe was a revolutionary character,—and\nso were Sumner and Lincoln,—but he was a man in all matters prudent,\ndiscreet and practical. He was as much opposed to inflammatory harangues\nand French socialistic notions as he was to the hide-bound conservatism\nagainst which he had battled all his life. Like Hampden and Adams his\nrevolutionary strokes were well timed and right to the point. Experience\nhas proved them to be effective and salutary. It was the essential merit\nof Sumner and his friends that they recognized the true character of the\ntimes in which they lived and adapted themselves to it. Thousands of\nwell-educated men lived through the anti-slavery and civil war period\nwithout being aware that they were taking part in one of the great\nrevolutionary epochs of history. That Doctor Howe and Senator Sumner\ndiffered in regard to the Cuban rebellion is a matter of small moment.\nHowe considered the interests of the Cubans; Sumner the interests of\nrepublicanism in Spain and in Europe generally. Both were right from\ntheir respective standpoints.",
        "At the beginning of the war he was sixty years of age,—too old to take\nan active part in it. This cannot be doubted, however, that if he had\nbeen thirty years younger he would either have won distinction as a\ncommander or have fallen on the, field of honor. The best contribution\nfrom the Howe family to the war was Julia Ward Howe’s “Battle Hymn of the\nRepublic.” The war was a grand moral struggle, a conflict of historical\nforces; and neither Lowell, Emerson, nor Whittier expressed this so fully\nand with such depth of feeling as Mrs. Howe. There are occasions when\nwoman rises superior to man, and this was one of them. It was evidently\ninspired by the John Brown song, that simple martial melody; but it rises\nabove the personal and temporal into the universal and eternal. Its\nmeasure has the swing of the Greek tragic chorus, extended to embrace the\nwider scope of Christian faith, and its diction is of an equally classic\npurity and vigor. The last stanza runs:",
        "This was the fine fruit of Mrs. Howe’s early religious faith. It welled\nup in her nature from a deep undercurrent, which few would have suspected\nwho only met her at Sam G. Ward’s dinner parties and other fashionable\nentertainments. Yet, there was always a quiet reserve in her laughter,\nand her wittiest remarks were always followed by a corresponding\nseriousness of expression. Although she studied Spinoza, admired Emerson,\nand attended meetings of the Radical Club on Chestnut Street, she never\nseparated herself from the Church, and always expressed her dissent from\nany opinion that seemed to show a lack of reverence.",
        "On a certain occasion when a member of the club spoke of newspapers as\nlikely to supersede the pulpit, Mrs. Howe replied to him: “God forbid\nthat should happen. God forbid we should do without the pulpit. It is the\nold fable of the hare and the tortoise. We need the hare for light\nrunning, but the slow, steady tortoise wins the goal at last.” Religious\nsubjects, however, were not so much discussed at the Radical Club as\nphilosophy and politics,—and in these Mrs. Howe felt herself very much\nat home.",
        "On another occasion, when a member of the club said that he was prepared,\nlike Emerson, to accept the universe, Mrs. Howe interposed with the\nremark that it was Margaret Fuller who accepted the universe; she “was\nnot aware that the universe had been offered to Emerson.” She said this\nbecause Margaret Fuller was a woman.",
        "Once, when writing for the newspapers was under discussion, Mrs. Howe\nremarked that in that kind of composition one felt prescribed like St.\nSimeon Stylites by the limitations of the column.",
        "One of the best of her witty poems describes Boston on a rainy day, and\nis called “Expluvior,” an innocent parody on Longfellow’s “Excelsior,\"\nwhich, by the way, ought to have been called Excelsius.",
        "is one of the most characteristic verses; but in the last stanza she\nwishes to construct a dam at the foot of Beacon Hill and cause a flood\nthat would sweep the rebel sympathizers out of Boston.",
        "The office of the Blind Asylum was formerly near the middle of Bromfield\nStreet on the southern side. This is now historic ground. Between 1850\nand 1870 some of the most important national councils were held there in\nDr. Howe’s private office. It was the first place that Sumner went to in\nthe morning and the last place that Governor Andrew stopped before\nreturning to his home at night. There Dr. Howe and George L. Stearns\nconsulted with John Brown concerning measures for the defence of Kansas;\nand there Howe, Stearns, and Bird concerted plans for the election of\nAndrew in 1860, and for the re-election of Sumner in 1862. It was a\nquiet, retired spot in the midst of a hustling city, where a celebrated\nman could go without attracting public attention.",
        "Chevalier Howe outlived Sumner just one year, and Wilson followed him not\nlong after.",
        "Sebago is one of the most beautiful of the New England lakes, and has\nbeen celebrated in Longfellow’s verse for its curiously winding river\nbetween the upper and the lower portion, as well as for the Indian\ntraditions connected with it. John A. Andrew’s grandfather, like\nHawthorne’s father, lived in Salem and both families emigrated to Sebago,\nthe former locating himself in the small town of Windham. At the time\nwhen Hawthorne was sailing his little boat on the lake, at the age of\nfourteen, John Andrew was in his nurse’s arms,—born May 31, 1818. Like\nHawthorne and Longfellow he went to Bowdoin College, but did not\ndistinguish himself there as a scholar,—had no honors at commencement.\nWe are still in ignorance concerning his college life, what his interests\nwere, and how he spent his time; but Andrew never cared much for anything\nwhich had not an immediate and practical value. Greek and Latin, merely\nfor their own sake as ancient languages, did not appeal to him; nor did\nthe desiccated history and cramping philosophy of those days attract him\nmore strongly. Yet he ultimately developed one of the finest of American\nintellects.",
        "He was admitted to the Suffolk bar at the age of twenty-two. He had\nalready formed decided opinions on the slavery question. The practitioner\nwith whom he studied was precisely the opposite of Andrew,—a brilliant\nscholar, but formal and unsympathetic. Although a young man of fine\npromise he was soon excelled by his less learned but more energetic\npupil. At the age of twenty-six we find Andrew presiding at a convention\nof Free-soilers, the same which nominated Dr. S. G. Howe for Congress.\nWhy he did not appear in politics between 1844 and 1859 is something of a\nmystery, which may be explained either by his devotion to his profession\nor his unwillingness to make politics a profession. He was in constant\ncommunication with Charles Francis Adams, Frank W. Bird, and other\nleading independents, and played a part in the election of Sumner as well\nas at various nominating conventions; but he apparently neither sought\noffice nor was sought for it. It may have been a modest conscientiousness\nof his own value, which prevented the acceptance of public honors until\nhe was prepared to claim the best; but the fact is difficult to account\nfor on any supposition.",
        "Neither was his success at the bar remarkable. He never earned a large\nincome, and died comparatively poor. There were few who cared to meet him\nin debate, yet his legal scholarship was not exceptional, and his\npolitical opinions may have proved an impediment to him in a city which\nwas still devoted to Webster and Winthrop. Moreover, his kindness of\nheart prompted him to undertake a large number of cases for which he\nreceived little or no remuneration. As late as 1856 he was known as the\npoor man’s lawyer rather than as a distinguished pleader. One cannot help\nreflecting what might have been John A. Andrew’s fortune if he had been\nborn in Ohio or Illinois. In the latter State he would have proved a most\nimportant political factor; for he was fully as able a speaker as\nDouglas, and he combined with this a large proportion of those estimable\nqualities which we all admire in Abraham Lincoln. He had not the wit of\nLincoln, nor his immense fund of anecdote, which helped so much to make\nhim popular, but the cordial manners and manly frankness of Andrew were\nvery captivating. He would have told Douglas to his face that he was a\ndemagogue, as Mirabeau did to Robespierre, and would have carried the\naudience with him. It certainly seems as if he would have risen to\ndistinction there more rapidly than in old-fashioned, conventional\nBoston.",
        "Governor Andrew was an inch shorter than the average height of man, and\nmuch resembled Professor Child in personal appearance. He was a larger\nman than Professor Child, and his hair was darker, but he had the same\nround, good-humored face, with keen penetrating eyes beneath a brow as\nfinely sculptured as that of a Greek statue, and closely curling hair\nabove it. He was broad-shouldered, remarkably so, and had a strong figure\nbut not a strong constitution. His hands were soft and as white as a\nwoman’s; and though his step was quick and elastic he disliked to walk\nlong distances, and was averse to physical exercise generally.",
        "He also resembled Professor Child in character,—frank without bluntness;\nsincere both formally and intellectually,—full to the brim of moral\ncourage. He was not only kind-hearted, but very tender-hearted, so that\nhis lips would quiver on occasions and his eyes fill with tears,—what\ndoctors improperly call a lachrymose nature; but in regard to a question\nof principle or public necessity he was as firm as Plymouth Rock. Neither\ndid he deceive himself, as kindly persons are too apt to do, in regard to\nthe true conditions of the case in hand. He would interrogate an\napplicant for assistance in as judicious a manner as he would a witness\nin a court room. He never degenerated into the professed philanthropist,\nwho makes a disagreeable and pernicious habit of one of the noblest\nattributes of man. “A mechanical virtue,” he would say, “is no virtue at\nall.”",
        "The impressions of youth are much stronger and more enduring than those\nof middle life, and I still remember Andrew as he appeared presiding at\nthe meeting for the benefit of John Brown’s wife and daughters in\nNovember, 1859. This was his first notable appearance before the public,\nand nothing could have been more daring or more likely to make him\nunpopular; and yet within twelve months he was elected Governor. His\nattitude and his whole appearance was resolute and intrepid. He had set\nhis foot down, and no power on earth could induce him to withdraw it. A\nclergyman who had been invited to speak at the meeting had at first\naccepted, but being informed by some of his parishioners that the thing\nwould not do, declined with the excuse that he had supposed there would\nbe two sides to the question. “As if,” said Andrew, “there could be two\nsides to the question whether John Brown’s wife and daughters should be\npermitted to starve.” Thomas Russell, Judge of the Superior Court, sat\nclose under the platform, clapping his hands like pistol shots.",
        "John A. Andrew’s testimony before the Harper’s Ferry investigating\ncommittee has a historical value which Hay and Nicolay, Wilson, and\nVon Holst would have done well to have taken into consideration; but the\ndefinitive history of the war period is yet to be written. There was no\nreason why Andrew should have been summoned. He had never met John Brown\nbut once—at a lady’s house in Boston—and had given him twenty-five\ndollars without knowing what was to be done with it. Jefferson Davis and\nthe other Southern members of the committee evidently sent for him to\nmake capital against the Republican party, but the result was different\nfrom what they anticipated. Andrew told them squarely that the Harper’s\nFerry invasion was the inevitable consequence of their attempt to force\nslavery on Kansas against the will of its inhabitants, and that the\nPottawatomie massacre, whether John Brown was connected with it or not,\nwas not so bad in its moral effect as the assault on Sumner. It was what\nthey might expect from attempting to tyrannize over frontier farmers. It\nis not to be supposed that such men will be governed by the nice sense of\njustice of an eastern law court.",
        "His testimony in regard to the personal magnetism of John Brown is of\ngreat value; but he also admitted that there was something about the old\nman which he could not quite understand,—a mental peculiarity which may\nhave resulted from his hard, barren life, or the fixedness of his\npurpose.",
        "Andrew had already been elected to the Legislature, and had taken his\nseat there in January, 1860. Almost in an instant he became the leader of\nhis party in the House. Always ready to seize the right moment, he united\nthe two essential qualities of a debater, a good set speech and a\npertinent reply. Perfectly fearless and independent, he was exactly the\nman to guide his party through a critical period. There were few in the\nhouse who cared to interfere with him.",
        "Andrew was chairman of the Massachusetts delegation at the Chicago\nConvention in May, and although he voted for Seward he was directly\ninstrumental in the nomination of Lincoln. It is said to have been at his\nsuggestion that the Massachusetts delegation called together the\ndelegations of those States that defeated Fremont in 1856, and inquired\nof them which of the candidates would be most certain to carry their\nconstituencies; and with one accord they all answered Lincoln. Thus\nLincoln’s nomination was practically assured before the voting began.",
        "It has been repeatedly asserted that the nomination of Andrew for\nGovernor was the result of a general popular movement; but this was\nsimply impossible. He was chiefly known to the voters of the State at\nthat time as the presiding officer of a John Brown meeting, and that was\nquite as likely to retard as to advance his interests. He had, however,\nbecome a popular leader in the Legislature, and the fact that Governor\nBanks was opposed to him and cast his influence in favor of a Pittsfield\ncandidate, left a sort of political vacuum in the more populous portion\nof the State, which Frank W. Bird and Henry L. Pierce took advantage of\nto bring his name forward. Sumner and Wilson threw their weight into the\nscales, and Andrew was easily nominated; but he owed this to Frank W.\nBird more than to any other supporter.",
        "In the New York Herald of December 20, 1860, there was the\nfollowing item: “Governor-elect Andrew, of Massachusetts, and George L.\nStearns have gone to Washington together, and it is said that the object\nof their visit is to brace up weak-kneed Republicans.” This was one\nobject of their journey, but they also went to survey the ground and see\nwhat was the true state of affairs at the Capital. Stearns wrote from\nWashington to the Bird Club: “The watchword here is ’Keep quiet,’” a\nsentence full of significance for the interpretation of the policy\npursued by the Republican leaders that winter. Andrew returned with the\nconviction that war was imminent and could not be prevented. His\ncelebrated order in regard to the equipment of the State militia followed\nimmediately, and after the bombardment of Fort Sumter this was looked\nupon as a true prophecy. He foresaw the difficulty at Baltimore, and had\nalready chartered steamships to convey regiments to Washington, in case\nthere should be a general uprising in Maryland.",
        "Both Sumner and Wilson opposed the appointment of General Butler to the\ncommand of the Massachusetts Volunteers, and preferred Caleb Gushing, who\nafterwards proved to be a more satisfactory member of the Republican\nparty than Butler; but, on the whole, Andrew would seem to have acted\njudiciously. They were both bold, ingenious and quick-witted men, but it\nis doubtful if Gushing possessed the dash and intrepidity which Butler\nshowed in dealing with the situation at Baltimore. That portion of his\nmilitary career was certainly a good success, and how far he should be\nheld responsible for the corrupt proceedings of his brother at New\nOrleans I do not undertake to decide.",
        "It is likely that Governor Andrew regretted his choice three weeks later,\nwhen General Butler offered his services to the Governor of Maryland to\nsuppress a slave insurrection which never took place, and of which there\nwas no danger then or afterwards. A sharp correspondence followed between\nthe Governor and the General, in which the latter nearly reached the\npoint of insubordination. For excellent reasons this was not made public\nat the time, and is little known at the present day; but General Butler\nowed his prominence in the war wholly to Governor Andrew’s appointment.",
        "Another little-known incident was Andrew’s action in regard to the\nmeeting in memory of John Brown, which was held on December 2, 1861, by\nWendell Phillips, F. B. Sanborn and others, who were mobbed exactly as\nGarrison was mobbed thirty years earlier. The Mayor would do nothing to\nprotect them, and when Wendell Phillips went to seek assistance from\nAndrew the latter declined to interfere. It would be a serious matter to\ninterfere with the Mayor, and he did not feel that the occasion demanded\nit. Moreover he considered the celebration at that time to be prejudicial\nto the harmony of the Union cause. Phillips was already very much\nirritated and left the Governor’s office in no friendly mood. Andrew\nmight have said to him: “You have been mobbed; what more do you want?\nThere is no more desirable honor than to be mobbed in a good cause.”",
        "Governor Andrew’s appointments continued to be so favorable to the\nDemocrats that Martin F. Conway, the member of Congress from Kansas,\nsaid: “The Governor has come into power with the help of his friends, and\nhe intends to retain it by conciliating his opponents.” It certainly\nlooked like this; but no one who knew Andrew intimately would believe\nthat he acted from interested motives. Moreover it was wholly unnecessary\nto conciliate them. It is customary in Massachusetts to give the Governor\nthree annual terms, and no more; but Andrew was re-elected four times,\nand it seemed as if he might have had as many terms as Caius Marius had\nconsulships if he had only desired it.",
        "His object evidently was to unite all classes and parties in a vigorous\nsupport of the Union cause, and he could only do this by taking a number\nof colonels and other commissioned officers from the Democratic ranks.\nFor company officers there was no better recommendation to him than for a\nyoung man to be suspended, or expelled, from Harvard University. “Those\nturbulent fellows,” he said, “always make good fighters, and,” he added\nin a more serious tone, “some of them will not be greatly missed if they\ndo not return.” The young aristocrat who was expelled for threatening to\ntweak his professor’s nose obtained a commission at once.",
        "Another case of this sort was so pathetic that it deserves to be\ncommemorated. Sumner Paine (named after Charles Sumner), the finest\nscholar in his class at Harvard, was suspended in June, 1863, for some\ntrifling folly and went directly to the Governor for a commission as\nLieutenant. Having an idea that the colored regiments were a particular\nhobby with the Governor, he asked for a place in one of them; but Andrew\nreplied that the list was full; he could, however, give him a Lieutenancy\nin the Twentieth Massachusetts, which was then in pursuit of General Lee.\nSumner Paine accepted this, and ten days later he was shot dead on the\nfield of Gettysburg. Governor Andrew felt very badly; for Paine was not\nonly a fine scholar but very handsome, and, what is rare among hard\nstudents, full of energy and good spirits.",
        "Governor Andrew tried a number of conclusions, as Shakespeare would call\nthem, with the National Government during the war, but the most serious\ndifficulty of this kind resulted from Secretary Stanton’s arbitrary\nreduction of the pay of colored soldiers from thirteen to eight dollars a\nmonth. This, of course, was a breach of contract, and Governor Andrew\nfelt a personal responsibility in regard to it, so far as the\nMassachusetts regiments were concerned.",
        "He first protested against it to the Secretary of War; but, strange to\nsay, Stanton obtained a legal opinion in justification of his order from\nWilliam Whiting, the solicitor of the War Department. Governor Andrew\nthen appealed to President Lincoln, who referred the case to Attorney-\nGeneral Bates, and Bates, after examining the question, reported\nadversely to Solicitor Whiting and notified President Lincoln that the\nGovernment would be liable to an action for damages. The President\naccordingly referred this report to Stanton, who paid no attention\nwhatever to it.",
        "Meanwhile the Massachusetts Legislature had passed an act to make good\nthe deficiency of five dollars a month to the Massachusetts colored\nregiments, but the private soldiers, with a magnanimity that should never\nbe forgotten, refused to accept from the State what they considered due\nthem from the National Government. At last Governor Andrew applied to\nCongress for redress, declaring that if he did not live to see justice\ndone to his soldiers in this world he would carry his appeal “before the\nTribunal of Infinite Justice.”",
        "Thaddeus Stevens introduced a bill for the purpose June 4,1864, and after\nwaiting a whole year the colored soldiers received their dues. Andrew\ndeclared in his message to Congress that this affair was a disgrace to\nthe National Government; and I fear we shall have to agree with him.\n[Footnote: At this time there were not less than five thousand officers\ndrawing pay in the Union armies above the requisite proportion of one\nofficer to twenty-two privates.]",
        "Sixty years ago Macaulay noticed the injurious effects on oratory of\nnewspaper publication. Parliamentary speeches were written to be read\nrather than to be listened to. It was a peculiarity of Andrew, however,\nthat he wrote his letters and even his messages to the Legislature as if\nhe were making a speech. In conversation he was plain, sensible and\nkindly.",
        "He made no pretensions to oratory in his public addresses, but his\ndelivery was easy, clear, and emphatic. At times he spoke rather rapidly,\nbut not so much so as to create a confused impression. I never knew him\nto make an argumentum ad hominem, nor to indulge in those\nrhetorical tricks which even Webster and Everett were not wholly free\nfrom. He convinced his hearers as much by the fairness of his manner as\nby anything that he said.",
        "The finest passage in his speeches, as we read them now, is his tribute\nto Lincoln’s character in his address to the Legislature, following upon\nLincoln’s assassination. After describing him as the man who had added\n\"martyrdom itself to his other and scarcely less emphatic claims to human\nveneration, gratitude and love,” he continued thus: “I desire on this\ngrave occasion to record my sincere testimony to the unaffected\nsimplicity of his manly purpose, to the constancy with which he devoted\nhimself to his duty, to the grand fidelity with which he subordinated\nhimself to his country, to the clearness, robustness, and sagacity of his\nunderstanding, to his sincere love of truth, his undeviating progress in\nits faithful pursuit, and to the confidence which he could not fail to\ninspire in the singular integrity of his virtues and the conspicuously\njudicial quality of his intellect.”",
        "Could any closer and more comprehensive description be given of Andrew’s\nown character; and is there another statement so appreciative in the\nvarious biographies of Lincoln?",
        "The instances of his kindness and helpfulness were multitudinous, but\nhave now mostly lapsed into oblivion. During his five years in office it\nseemed as if every distressed man, woman, and child came to the Governor\nfor assistance. William G. Russell, who declined the position of Chief\nJustice, once said of him: “There was no better recommendation to\nAndrew’s favor than for a man to have been in the State’s prison, if it\ncould only be shown that he had been there longer than he deserved.”",
        "Andrew considered the saving of a human soul more important than rescuing\na human life. That he was often foiled, deceived, and disappointed in\nthese reformatory attempts is perfectly true; but was it not better so\nthan never to have made them? For a long time he had charge of an\nintemperate nephew, who even sold his overcoat to purchase drink; but the\nGovernor never deserted the fellow and cared for him as well as he could.",
        "This is the more significant on account of Andrew’s strong argument\nagainst prohibitory legislation, which was the last important act of his\nlife.",
        "In February, 1864, there was a military ball at Concord for the benefit\nof the Thirty-second Massachusetts Regiment. Governor Andrew was present,\nand seeing the son of an old friend sitting in a corner and looking much\nneglected while his brother was dancing and having a fine time, the\nGovernor went to him, took him by the arm and marched several times\naround the hall with him. He then went to Mrs. Hawthorne, inquired what\nher husband was writing, and explained the battle of Gettysburg to her,\ndrawing a diagram of it on a letter which he took from his coat pocket.\nYears afterwards Mrs. Hawthorne spoke of this as one of the pleasantest\ninterviews of her life.",
        "He would come in late to dinner at the Bird Club, looking so full of\nforce that he seemed as much like a steam-engine as a man. They usually\napplauded him, but he paid no attention to it. “Waiter, bring me some\nminced fish with carrots and beets,” he would say. His fish-dinner became\nproverbial, but he complained that they could not serve it at fine hotels\nin the way our grandmothers made it. He said it did not taste the same.",
        "His private secretary states that Governor Andrew’s favorite sans\nsouci was to take a drive into the country with some friend, and\nafter he had passed the thickly settled suburbs to talk, laugh and jest\nas young men do on a yachting excursion,—but his talk was always\nrefined. There was no recreation that Professor Francis J. Child liked\nbetter than this.",
        "Andrew’s valedictory address on January 5, 1865, which was chiefly\nconcerned with the reconstruction of the Southern States, was little\nunderstood at the time even by his friends; and in truth he did not make\nout his scheme as clearly as he might have done. He considered negro\nsuffrage the first essential of reconstruction, but he did not believe in\nenfranchising the colored people and disfranchising the whites. He\nforesaw that this could only end in disaster; and he advised that the\nrebellious States should remain under military government until the white\npeople of the South should rescind their acts of secession and adopt\nnegro suffrage of their own accord. There would have been certain\nadvantages in this over the plan that was afterwards adopted—that is,\nSumner’s plan—but it included the danger that the Southern States might\nhave adopted universal suffrage and negro citizenship for the sake of\nCongressional representation, and afterwards have converted it into a\ndead letter, as it is at present. Andrew considered Lincoln’s attempts at\nreconstruction as premature, and therefore injudicious.",
        "For nearly twenty-five years John A. Andrew was a parishioner of Rev.\nJames Freeman Clarke, who preached in Indiana Place Chapel. In 1848 Rev.\nMr. Clarke desired to exchange with Theodore Parker, but older members of\nhis parish strenuously opposed it. Andrew, then only twenty-seven years\nold, came forward in support of his pastor, and argued the case\nvigorously, not because he agreed with Parker’s theological opinions, but\nbecause he considered the opposition illiberal. After this both Andrew\nand Clarke would seem to have become gradually more conservative, for\nwhen the latter delivered a sermon or lecture in 1866 in opposition to\nEmerson’s philosophy, the ex-Governor printed a public letter requesting\nhim to repeat it. It is easy to trace the influence of James Freeman\nClarke in Governor Andrew’s religious opinions and Andrew’s influence on\nRev. Mr. Clarke’s politics. Each was a firm believer in the other.",
        "The movement to supersede Sumner with Andrew as United States Senator, in\n1869, originated in what is called the Back Bay district. It was not\nbecause they loved Andrew there, but because they hated Sumner, who\nrepresented to their minds the loss of political power which they had\nenjoyed from the foundation of the Republic until his election in 1850,\nand have never recovered it since. Andrew’s political record and his\ndemocratic manners could hardly have been to their liking.",
        "The Boston aristocracy counted for success on the support of the Grand\nArmy veterans, who were full of enthusiasm for Andrew; but it is not\nprobable that the ex-Governor would have been willing to lead a movement\nwhich his best friends disapproved of, and which originated with the same\nclass of men who tried so hard to defeat him in 1862. Moreover, they\nwould have found a very sturdy opponent in Senator Wilson. It was Wilson\nwho had made Sumner a Senator, and for fifteen years they had fought side\nby side without the shadow of a misunderstanding between them. Under such\nconditions men cannot help feeling a strong affection for one another.\nBesides this, Wilson would have been influenced by interested motives.\nSumner cared nothing for the minor Government offices—the classified\nservice—except so far as to assist occasionally some unfortunate person\nwho had been crowded out of the regular lines; and this afforded Wilson a\nfine opportunity of extending his influence. If Andrew were chosen\nSenator in the way that was anticipated Wilson knew well enough that this\npatronage would have to be divided between them.",
        "Andrew could not have replaced Sumner in the Senate. He lacked the\nphysical strength as well as the experience, and that extensive range of\nlegal and historical knowledge which so often disconcerted Sumner’s\nopponents. He had a genius for the executive, and the right position for\nhim would have been in President Grant’s cabinet. That he would have been\noffered such a place can hardly be doubted.",
        "But Governor Andrew’s span of life was over. He might have lived longer\nif he had taken more physical exercise; but the great Civil War proved\nmore fatal to the statesmen who were engaged in it than to the generals\nin the field. None of the great leaders of the Republican party lasted\nvery long after this.",
        "Andrew’s friends always felt that the man was greater than his position,\nand that he really missed the opportunity to develop his ability to its\nfull extent. His position was not so difficult as that of Governor\nMorgan, of New York, or Governor Morton, of Indiana; for he was supported\nby one of the wealthiest and most patriotic of the States. It was his\nclear insight into the political problems of his time and the\nfearlessness with which he attacked them that gave him such influence\namong his contemporaries, and made him felt as a moral force to the\nutmost limits of the Union. No public man has ever left a more stainless\nreputation, and we only regret that he was not as considerate of himself\nas he was of others.",
        "The first colored regiment in the Civil War was organized by General\nHunter at Beaufort, S. C., in May, 1862, without permission from the\nGovernment; and some said, perhaps unjustly, that he was removed from his\ncommand on that account. It was reorganized by General Saxton the\nfollowing August, and accepted by the Secretary of War a short time\nafterwards. Rev. T. W. Higginson, who had led the attack on Boston Court\nHouse in the attempt to rescue Anthony Burns, was commissioned as its\nColonel.",
        "In August also George L. Stearns, being aware that Senator Sumner was\npreparing a speech to be delivered at the Republican State convention,\nwent to his house on Hancock Street and urged that he should advocate in\nit the general enlistment of colored troops; but Sumner said decisively,\n\"No, I do not consider it advisable to agitate that question until the\nProclamation of Emancipation has become a fact. Then we will take another\nstep in advance.” At a town meeting held in Medford, in December, Mr.\nStearns made a speech on the same subject, and was hissed for his pains\nby the same men who were afterwards saved from the conscription of 1863\nby the negroes whom he recruited.",
        "Lewis Hayden, the colored janitor of the State House, always claimed the\ncredit of having suggested to Governor Andrew to organize a colored\nregiment of Massachusetts Volunteers. William S. Robinson, who was then\nClerk of the State Senate, supported Hayden in this; but he also remarked\nthat Representative Durfee, of New Bedford, proposed a bill in May, 1861,\nfor the organization of a colored regiment, and that it was only defeated\nby six votes.",
        "As soon as the Proclamation of Emancipation had been issued the Governor\nwent to Washington for a personal interview with the Secretary of War,\nand returned with the desired permission. Mr. Stearns went with him and\nobtained a commission for James Montgomery, who had defended the Kansas\nborder during Buchanan’s administration, to be Colonel of another colored\nregiment in South Carolina. Colonel Montgomery arrived at Beaufort about\nthe first of February.",
        "Governor Andrew formed the skeleton of a regiment with Robert G. Shaw as\nColonel, but was able to obtain few recruits. There were plenty of sturdy\nnegroes about Boston, but they were earning higher wages than ever\nbefore, and were equally afraid of what might happen to them if they were\ncaptured by the Confederate forces. Colonel Hallowell says: “The Governor\ncounselled with certain leading colored men of Boston. He put the\nquestion, Will your people enlist in my regiments? ’They will not,’ was\nthe reply of all but Hayden. ’We have no objection to white officers, but\nour self-respect demands that competent colored men shall be at least\neligible to promotion.’” By the last of February less than two companies\nhad been recruited, and the prospects of the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts\ndid not look hopeful.",
        "When Governor Andrew was in doubt he usually sent for Frank W. Bird and\nGeorge L. Stearns, but this time Mr. Stearns was before him. To the\nGovernor’s question, “What is to done?” he replied, “If you will obtain\nfunds from the Legislature for their transportation, I will recruit you a\nregiment among the black men of Ohio and Canada West. There are a great\nmany runaways in Canada, and those are the ones who will go back and\nfight.” “Very good,” said the Governor; “go as soon as you can, and our\nfriend Bird will take care of the appropriation bill.” A handsome\nrecruiting fund for incidental expenses had already been raised, to which\nMr. Stearns was, as usual, one of the largest subscribers.",
        "He arrived at Buffalo, New York, the next day at noon, and went to a\ncolored barber to have his hair cut. He disclosed the object of his\nmission, and the barber promised to bring some of his friends together to\ndiscuss the matter that evening. The following evening Mr. Steams called\na meeting of the colored residents of Buffalo, and made an address to\nthem, urging the importance of the occasion, and the advantage it would\nbe to their brethren in slavery and to the future of the negro race, if\nthey were to become well-drilled and practiced soldiers. “When you have\nrifles in your hands,” he said, “your freedom will be secure.” To the\nobjection that only white officers were being commissioned for the\ncolored regiments he replied: “See how public opinion changes; how\nrapidly we move forward! Only three months ago I was hissed in a town\nmeeting for proposing the enlistment of colored troops; and now here we\nare! I have no doubt that before six months a number of colored officers\nwill be commissioned.” His speech was received with applause; but when he\nasked, “Now who will volunteer?” there was a prolonged silence. At length\na sturdy-looking fellow arose and said: “I would enlist if I felt sure\nthat my wife and children would not suffer for it.” “I will look after\nyour family,” said Mr. Stearns, “and see that they want for nothing; but\nit is a favor I cannot promise again.” After this ten or twelve more\nenrolled themselves, and having provided for their maintenance until they\ncould be transported to the camp at Readville, he went over to Niagara,\non the Canada side, to see what might be effected in that vicinity.",
        "In less than a week he was again in Buffalo arranging a recruiting\nbureau, with agencies in Canada and the Western States as far as St.\nLouis—where there were a large number of refugees who had lately been\nliberated by Grant’s campaign at Vicksburg. Mr. Lucian B. Eaton, an old\nlawyer and prominent politician of the city, accepted the agency there as\na work of patriotic devotion. Among Mr. Stearns’s most successful agents\nwere the Langston brothers, colored scions of a noble Virginia family,—\nboth excellent men and influential among their people. All his agents\nwere required to write a letter to him every evening, giving an account\nof their day’s work, and every week to send him an account of their\nexpenses. Thus Mr. Stearns sat at his desk and directed their movements\nby telegraph as easily as pieces on a chess-board. The appropriation for\ntransportation had already passed the Massachusetts Legislature, but\nwhere this did not suffice to meet an emergency he drew freely on his own\nresources.",
        "By the last of April recruits were coming in at the rate of thirty or\nforty a day, and Mr. Stearns telegraphed to the Governor: “I can fill up\nanother regiment for you in less than six weeks,\"—a hint which resulted\nin the Massachusetts Fifty-fifth, with Norwood P. Hallowell, a gallant\nofficer who had been wounded at Antietam, for its commander.",
        "The Governor, however, appears to have suddenly changed his mind, for on\nMay 7th Mr. Stearns wrote to his wife:",
        "“Yesterday at noon I learned from Governor Andrew by telegram that he did\nnot intend to raise another regiment. I was thunderstruck. My work for\nthree weeks would nearly, or quite, fall to the ground. I telegraphed in\nreply: ’You told me to take all the men I could get without regard to\nregiments. Have two hundred men on the way; what shall I do with them?’\nThe reply came simultaneously with your letter: ’Considering your\ntelegraph and Wild’s advice, another regiment may proceed, expecting it\nfull in four weeks. Present want of troops will probably prevent my being\nopposed.’ I replied: ’I thank God for your telegram received this\nmorning. You shall have the men in four weeks.’ Now all is right.”",
        "The Surgeon-General had detailed one Dr. Browne for duty at Buffalo to\nexamine Mr. Stearns’s recruits, and if found fit for service by him there\nwas presumably no need of a second examination. This, however, did not\nsuit the medical examiner at Readville, who either from ill will or from\nsome unknown motive, insisted on rejecting every sixth man sent there\nfrom the West. Thus there was entailed on Mr. Stearns an immense expense\nwhich he had no funds to meet, and he was obliged to make a private loan\nof ten thousand dollars without knowing in the least how or where he was\nto be reimbursed.",
        "Finally, on May 8, Mr. Stearns made a remonstrance against this abuse to\nGovernor Andrew in a letter in which he also gave this account of\nhimself:",
        "This letter is now in the archives of the State\nHouse at Boston, and on the back of it Governor\nAndrew has written:",
        "“JOHN A. ANDREW.”",
        "Shortly after this Mr. Stearns returned to Boston for a brief visit, and\nwas met in the street by a philanthropic lady, Mrs. E. D. Cheney, who\nasked: “Where have you been all this time, Mr. Stearns? I supposed you\nwere going to help us organize the colored regiment? You will be glad to\nknow that it is doing well. We have nearly a thousand men.” Mr. Stearns\nmade no reply, but bowed and passed on. This is the more surprising, as\nMrs. Cheney was president of a society of ladies who had presented the\nFifty-fourth Regiment with a flag; but the fault would seem to have been\nmore that of others than her own. At the celebration which took place on\nthe departure of the regiment for South Carolina, however, Wendell\nPhillips said: “We owe it chiefly to a private citizen, to George L.\nStearns, of Medford, that these heroic men are mustered into the\nservice,\"—a statement which astonished a good many. [Footnote: The\nstatement made by Governor Andrew’s private secretary concerning the\ncolored regiments in his memoir of the Governor would seem to have been\nintentionally misleading.]",
        "The Governors of the Western States had never considered their colored\npopulation as of any importance, but now, when it was being drained off\nto fill up the quota of Massachusetts troops they began to think\ndifferently. The Governor of Ohio advised Governor Andrew that no more\nrecruiting could be permitted in his State unless the recruits were\nassigned to the Ohio quota. Andrew replied that the Governor of Ohio was\nat liberty to recruit colored regiments of his own; but the Massachusetts\nFifty-fifth, having now a complement, it was decided not to continue the\nbusiness any further, and Mr. Stearns’s labors at Buffalo were thus\nbrought to an end about the middle of June. He had recruited fully one-\nhalf of the Fifty-fourth, and nearly the whole of the Fifty-fifth\nregiments.",
        "He now conceived the idea of making his recruiting bureau serviceable by\nplacing it in the hands of the Government. He therefore went to\nWashington and meeting his friend, Mr. Fred Law Olmstead, at Willard’s\nHotel, the latter offered to go with him to the War Department and\nintroduce him to Secretary Stanton. They found Stanton fully alive to the\noccasion, and in reply to Mr. Stearns’s offer he said:",
        "“I have heard of your recruiting bureau, and I think you would be the\nbest man to run the machine you have constructed. I will make you an\nAssistant Adjutant-General with the rank of Major, and I will give you\nauthority to recruit colored regiments all over the country.”",
        "Stearns thanked him, and replied that there was nothing which he had so\nmuch at heart as enlisting the black men on a large scale; for no people\ncould be said to be secure in their freedom unless they were also\nsoldiers; but his wife was unwell, and had suffered much from his absence\nalready, and he did not feel that he ought to accept the offer without\nher consent. In answer to the question how funds for recruiting were to\nbe obtained without any appropriation by Congress, Mr. Stanton said they\ncould be supplied from the Secret Service fund.",
        "When Mr. Stearns and Mr. Olmstead were alone on the street again, the\nlatter said: “Mr. Stearns, go to your room and sleep if you can.”",
        "Having returned to Boston, to arrange his affairs for a prolonged\nabsence, and having obtained his wife’s consent, Mr. Stearns ordered his\nrecruiting bureau to report at Philadelphia, where he soon after followed\nit.",
        "The battle of Gettysburg had stirred Philadelphia to its foundations, and\nits citizens were prepared to welcome anything that promised a vigorous\nprosecution of the war. Major Stearns was at once enrolled among the\nmembers of the Union League Club, the parent of all the union leagues in\nthe country, and was invited to the meetings of various other clubs and\nfashionable entertainments. A recruiting committee was formed from among\nthe most prominent men in the city. Camp William Penn, while the colored\nregiment was being drilled, became a fashionable resort, and fine\nequipages filled the road thither every after-noon. By the middle of July\nthe first regiment was nearly full.",
        "Fine weather does not often last more than a few weeks at a time, and in\nthe midst of these festivities suddenly came Secretary Stanton’s order\nreducing the pay of colored soldiers from thirteen to eight dollars a\nmonth. This was a breach of contract and the men had a right to their\ndischarge if they wished it; but that, of course, was not permitted them.\nSuch an action could only be excused on the ground of extreme necessity.\nThe Massachusetts Legislature promptly voted to pay the deficiency to the\nFifty-fourth and Fifty-fifth regiments; but the one at Philadelphia was\nin organization, and Mr. Stearns found himself in the position of a man\nwho has made promises which he is unable to fulfil.",
        "Hon. William D. Kelley and two other gentlemen of the committee went with\nMajor Stearns to Washington to see Stanton, and endeavored to persuade\nhim to revoke the order. Kelley was one of the most persistent debaters\nwho ever sat in Congress, and he argued the question with the Secretary\nof War for more than an hour,—to the great disgust of the latter,—but\nStanton was as firm as Napoleon ever was. Major Stearns never had another\npleasant interview with him.",
        "The Secretary’s argument was that some white regiments had complained of\nbeing placed on an equality with negroes, and that it interfered with\nrecruiting white soldiers. There was doubtless some reason in this; but\nthe same result might have been obtained by a smaller reduction.",
        "The next morning some one remarked to Major Stearns that it was\nexceedingly hot weather, even for Washington, and his reply was: “Yes,\nbut the fever within is worse than the heat without.” He talked of\nresigning; but finally said, decisively, “I will go and consult with\nOlmstead.”",
        "He found Mr. Olmstead friendly and sympathetic. He spoke of Secretary\nStanton in no complimentary terms, but he advised Mr. Stearns to continue\nwith his work, and endure all that he could for the good of the cause,—\nnot to be worried by evils for which he was in no way responsible. Mr.\nStearns returned to Willard’s with a more cheerful countenance.",
        "In the afternoon Judge Kelley came in with the news of the repulse of the\nFifty-fourth Massachusetts regiment at Fort Wagner and the death of\nColonel Shaw.",
        "There was a colored regiment in process of formation at Baltimore, and\nanother was supposed to be organizing at Fortress Monroe.",
        "Both were nominally under Mr. Stearns’s supervision, and he inspected the\nformer on his return trip to Philadelphia, and sent his son to\ninvestigate and report on the latter. Not the trace of a colored regiment\ncould be discovered at Fortress Monroe, but there were scores of Union\nofficers lounging and smoking on the piazza of the Hygeia Hotel. Mr.\nStearns thought that business economy had better begin by reducing the\nnumber of officers rather than the pay of the soldiers. On July 28 Major\nStearns wrote from Baltimore:",
        "No private business could succeed if carried on after the manner of the\nNational Government at that time, and this was not the fault of Lincoln’s\nadministration at all, but of the whole course of Jackson democracy from\n1829 to 1861. The clerks in the various departments did not hold their\npositions from the heads of those departments, but from outside\npoliticians who had no connection with the Government business, and as a\nconsequence they were saucy and insubordinate. They found it to their\ninterest to delay and obstruct the procedure of business in order to give\nthe impression that they were overworked, and in that way make their\npositions more secure and if possible of greater importance.",
        "Major Stearns had found himself continually embarrassed in his Government\nservice from lack of sufficient funds, and the continual delay in having\nhis accounts audited. The auditors of the War Department repeatedly took\nexception to expenditures that were absolutely necessary, and he was\nobliged to advance large sums from his own capital in order to provide\nthe current expenses of his agents. In this emergency he returned to\nBoston and held a conference with Mr. John M. Forbes and other friends;\nand they all agreed that he ought to be better supported in the work of\nrecruiting than he had been. A subscription was immediately set on foot,\nand in a few days a recruiting fund of about thirty thousand dollars was\nraised and placed in charge of Mr. R. P. Hallowell.",
        "On September 1, Secretary Stanton transferred Major Stearns to Nashville,\nwhere he could obtain recruits in large numbers, not only from Tennessee\nbut from the adjoining States. Fugitives flocked to his standard from\nAlabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky. For the succeeding five months he\norganized colored regiments so rapidly that it was with difficulty the\nGeneral commanding at Nashville could supply the necessary quota of\nofficers for them. His letter-writing alone rarely came to less than\ntwenty pages a day, and besides this he was obliged to attend personally\nto innumerable details which were constantly interfering with more\nimportant affairs. Serious questions concerning the rights and legal\nposition of the freedmen were continually arising, and these required a\ncool head and a clear understanding for their solution.",
        "Edward J. Bartlett, of Concord, who was one of his staff in Nashville,\nstated afterwards that he never saw a man who could despatch so much\nbusiness in a day as George L. Stearns. He says:",
        "    “I shall never forget the fine appearance of the first regiment we\n    sent off. They were all picked men, and felt a just pride in wearing\n    the blue. As fast as we obtained enough recruits they were formed\n    into regiments, officered and sent to the front. When men became\n    scarce in the city we made trips into the country, often going beyond\n    the Union picket line, and generally reaping a harvest of slaves.\n    These expeditions brought an element of danger into our lives, for\n    our forage parties were fired into by the enemy more than once, but we\n    always succeeded in bringing back our men with us. The black regiments\n    did valuable service for the Union, leaving their dead on many a\n    southern battle-field. Mr. Stearns was a noble man, courteous, with\n    great executive ability, and grandly fitted for the work he was\n    engaged in.”",
        "At this time Major Stearns’s friend, General Wilde, was recruiting a\ncolored brigade in North Carolina, and General Ullman was organizing\ncolored regiments in Louisiana.",
        "Major Stearns’s labors were brought to a close in February, 1864, by the\neccentric conduct of Secretary Stanton,—the reason for which has never\nbeen explained. He obtained leave of absence to return to Boston at\nChristmas time, and after a brief visit to his family went to Washington\nand called upon the Secretary of War, who declined to see him three days\nin succession. On the evening of the fourth day he met Mr. Stanton at an\nevening party and Stanton said to him in his roughest manner: “Major\nStearns, why are you not in Tennessee?” This was a breach of official\netiquette on the part of the Secretary of War and Major Stearns sent in\nhis resignation at once. His reason for doing so, however, was not so\nmuch on account of this personal slight as from the conclusion that he\nhad accomplished all that was essential to be done in this line. His\nchief assistant at Nashville, Capt. R. D. Muzzey, was an able man and\nperfectly competent to run the machine which Mr. Stearns had constructed.",
        "The importance of his work cannot readily be measured. It was no longer\neasy to obtain white volunteers. With a population ten millions less than\nthat of France, the Northern States were maintaining an army much larger\nthan the one which accompanied Napoleon to Moscow. General Thomas’s right\nwing, at the battle of Nashville, was formed almost entirely of colored\nregiments. They were ordered to make a feint attack on the enemy, so as\nto withdraw attention from the flanking movement of his veterans on the\nleft; but when the charge had once begun their officers were unable to\nkeep them in check—the feint was changed into a real attack and\ncontributed largely to the most decisive victory of the whole war.",
        "In his last annual Message President Lincoln congratulated Congress on\nthe success of the Government’s policy in raising negro regiments, and on\nthe efficiency of the troops organized in this way. It seems very\ndoubtful if the war could have been brought to a successful termination\nwithout them.",
        "In 1898 the Legislature of Massachusetts, at the instance of the veterans\nof the Fifty-fourth and Fifty-fifth regiments, voted to have a memorial\ntablet for the public services of George Luther Stearns set up in the\nDoric Hall of Boston State House, and the act was approved by Governor\nWalcott, who sent the quill with which he signed it to Major Stearns’s\nwidow.",
        "Delivered in the First Parish Church of Medford on the Sunday\nfollowing Major Stearns’s death, April 9, 1867.",
        "“We do not know how to prize good men until they depart. High virtue has\nsuch an air of nature and necessity that to thank its possessor would be\nto praise the water for flowing or the fire for warming us. But, on the\ninstant of their death, we wonder at our past insensibility, when we see\nhow impossible it is to replace them. There will be other good men, but\nnot these again. And the painful surprise which the last week brought us,\nin the tidings of the death of Mr. Stearns, opened all eyes to the just\nconsideration of the singular merits of the citizen, the neighbor, the\nfriend, the father, and the husband, whom this assembly mourns. We recall\nthe all but exclusive devotion of this excellent man during the last\ntwelve years to public and patriotic interests. Known until that time in\nno very wide circle as a man of skill and perseverance in his business;\nof pure life; of retiring and affectionate habits; happy in his domestic\nrelations,—his extreme interest in the national politics, then growing\nmore anxious year by year, engaged him to scan the fortunes of freedom\nwith keener attention. He was an early laborer in the resistance to\nslavery. This brought him into sympathy with the people of Kansas. As\nearly as 1855 the Emigrant Aid Society was formed; and in 1856 he\norganized the Massachusetts State Kansas Committee, by means of which a\nlarge amount of money was obtained for the ’free-State men,’ at times of\nthe greatest need. He was the more engaged to this cause by making in\n1857 the acquaintance of Captain John Brown, who was not only an\nextraordinary man, but one who had a rare magnetism for men of character,\nand attached some of the best and noblest to him, on very short\nacquaintance, by lasting ties. Mr. Stearns made himself at once necessary\nto Captain Brown as one who respected his inspirations, and had the\nmagnanimity to trust him entirely, and to arm his hands with all needed\nhelp.",
        "“For the relief of Kansas, in 1856-57, his own contributions were the\nlargest and the first. He never asked any one to give so much as he\nhimself gave, and his interest was so manifestly pure and sincere that he\neasily obtained eager offerings in quarters where other petitioners\nfailed. He did not hesitate to become the banker of his clients, and to\nfurnish them money and arms in advance of the subscriptions which he\nobtained. His first donations were only entering wedges of his later;\nand, unlike other benefactors, he did not give money to excuse his entire\npreoccupation in his own pursuits, but as an earnest of the dedication of\nhis heart and hand to the interests of the sufferers,—a pledge kept\nuntil the success he wrought and prayed for was consummated. In 1862, on\nthe President’s first or preliminary Proclamation of Emancipation, he\ntook the first steps for organizing the Freedman’s Bureau,—a department\nwhich has since grown to great proportions. In 1863, he began to recruit\ncolored soldiers in Buffalo; then at Philadelphia and Nashville. But\nthese were only parts of his work. He passed his time in incessant\nconsultations with all men whom he could reach, to suggest and urge the\nmeasures needed for the hour. And there are few men of real or supposed\ninfluence, North or South, with whom he has not at some time\ncommunicated. Every important patriotic measure in this region has had\nhis sympathy, and of many he has been the prime mover. He gave to each\nhis strong support, but uniformly shunned to appear in public. For\nhimself or his friends he asked no reward: for himself, he asked only to\ndo the hard work. His transparent singleness of purpose, his freedom from\nall by-ends, his plain good sense, courage, adherence, and his romantic\ngenerosity disarmed first or last all gainsayers. His examination before\nthe United States Senate Committee on the Harper’s Ferry Invasion, in\nJanuary, 1860, as reported in the public documents, is a chapter well\nworth reading, as a shining example of the manner in which a truth-\nspeaker baffles all statecraft, and extorts at last a reluctant homage\nfrom the bitterest adversaries.",
        "“I have heard, what must be true, that he had great executive skill, a\nclear method, and a just attention to all the details of the task in\nhand. Plainly he was no boaster or pretender, but a man for up-hill work,\na soldier to bide the brunt; a man whom disasters, which dishearten other\nmen, only stimulated to new courage and endeavor.",
        "“I have heard something of his quick temper: that he was indignant at\nthis or that man’s behavior, but never that his anger outlasted for a\nmoment the mischief done or threatened to the good cause, or ever stood\nin the way of his hearty co-operation with the offenders, when they\nreturned to the path of public duty. I look upon him as a type of the\nAmerican republican. A man of the people, in strictly private life, girt\nwith family ties; an active and intelligent manufacturer and merchant,\nenlightened enough to see a citizen’s interest in the public affairs, and\nvirtuous enough to obey to the uttermost the truth he saw,—he became, in\nthe most natural manner, an indispensable power in the State. Without\nsuch vital support as he, and such as he, brought to the government,\nwhere would that government be! When one remembers his incessant service;\nhis journeys and residences in many States; the societies he worked with;\nthe councils in which he sat; the wide correspondence, presently enlarged\nby printed circulars, then by newspapers established wholly or partly at\nhis own cost; the useful suggestions; the celerity with which his purpose\ntook form; and his immovable convictions,—I think this single will was\nworth to the cause ten thousand ordinary partisans, well-disposed enough,\nbut of feebler and interrupted action.",
        "“These interests, which he passionately adopted, inevitably led him into\npersonal communication with patriotic persons holding the same views,—\nwith two Presidents, with members of Congress, with officers of the\ngovernment and of the army, and with leading people everywhere. He had\nbeen always a man of simple tastes, and through all his years devoted to\nthe growing details of his prospering manufactory. But this sudden\nassociation now with the leaders of parties and persons of pronounced\npower and influence in the nation, and the broad hospitality which\nbrought them about his board at his own house, or in New York, or in\nWashington, never altered one feature of his face, one trait in his\nmanners. There he sat in the council, a simple, resolute Republican, an\nenthusiast only in his love of freedom and the good of men; with no pride\nof opinion, and with this distinction, that, if he could not bring his\nassociates to adopt his measure, he accepted with entire sweetness the\nnext best measure which could secure their assent. But these public\nbenefits were purchased at a severe cost. For a year or two, the most\naffectionate and domestic of men became almost a stranger in his\nbeautiful home. And it was too plain that the excessive toil and\nanxieties into which his ardent spirit led him overtasked his strength\nand wore out prematurely his constitution. It is sad that such a life\nshould end prematurely; but when I consider that he lived long enough to\nsee with his own eyes the salvation of his country, to which he had given\nall his heart; that he did not know an idle day; was never called to\nsuffer under the decays and loss of his powers, or to see that others\nwere waiting for his place and privilege, but lived while he lived, and\nbeheld his work prosper for the joy and benefit of all mankind,—I count\nhim happy among men.",
        "“Almost I am ready to say to these mourners, Be not too proud in your\ngrief, when you remember that there is not a town in the remote State of\nKansas that will not weep with you as at the loss of its founder; not a\nSouthern State in which the freedmen will not learn to-day from their\npreachers that one of their most efficient benefactors has departed, and\nwill cover his memory with benedictions; and that, after all his efforts\nto serve men without appearing to do so, there is hardly a man in this\ncountry worth knowing who does not hold his name in exceptional honor.\nAnd there is to my mind somewhat so absolute in the action of a good man,\nthat we do not, in thinking of him, so much as make any question of the\nfuture. For the Spirit of the Universe seems to say: ’He has done well;\nis not that saying all?’”",

        "The influence of Ohio in the United States of America during the past\nhalf century may be compared to that of Virginia during the first forty\nyears of the Republic. All of our Presidents, elected as such since 1860,\nhave come from Ohio, or adjacent territory. Cleveland came from beyond\nthe Alleghenies, and Lincoln was born on the southern side of the Ohio\nRiver. General Grant and General Sherman came from Ohio; and so did\nSalmon P. Chase, and John Brown, of Harper’s Perry celebrity. Chase gave\nthe country the inestimable blessing of a national currency; and even the\nVirginians admitted that John Brown was a very remarkable person.",

        "Sitting in the same school-house with John Brown, in 1816, was a boy\nnamed Elizur Wright who, like Brown, came from Connecticut, and to whom\nthe people of this country are also somewhat under obligation. Every\nwidow and orphan in the United States who receives the benefit of a life-\ninsurance policy owes a blessing to Elizur Wright, who was the first to\nestablish life insurance in America on a strong foundation, and whose\nreports on that subject, made during his long term as Insurance\nCommissioner for Massachusetts, have formed a sort of constitution by\nwhich the policy of all life-insurance companies is still guided. His\nname deserves a place beside those of Horace Mann and William Lloyd\nGarrison.",
        "Apart from this, his biography is one of the most interesting, one of the\nmost picturesque, when compared with those of the many brilliant men of\nhis time. His grandfather was a sea captain, and his father, who was also\nnamed Elizur, was a farmer in Canaan, Connecticut. His mother’s name was\nClarissa Richards, and he was born on the twelfth of February, 1804. In\nthe spring of 1810 the family moved to Talmage, Ohio, making the journey\nin a two-horse carriage with an ox-team to transport their household\ngoods. Their progress was necessarily slow, and it was nearly six weeks\nbefore they reached Talmage, as it was generally necessary to camp at\nnight by the way-side. This romantic journey, the building of their log-\ncabin, the clearing of the forest, and above all his solitary watches in\nthe maple-orchard (where he might perhaps be attacked by wolves), made a\ndeep poetic impression on young Elizur, and furnished him with a store of\npleasant memories in after life.",
        "They lived at first in a log-cabin, and afterwards his father built a\nsquare frame-house with a piazza and veranda in front, which is still\nstanding. The school where Elizur, Jr., met John Brown was at a long\ndistance for a boy to walk. He does not appear to have made friends with\nJohn, remarkably alike as they were in veracity, earnestness, and\nadherence to principle; but John was somewhat the elder, and two or three\nyears among boys counts for more than ten among grown people. In later\nlife, however, Mr. Wright told an interesting anecdote of young Brown,\nwhich runs as follows:",
        "John was the best-behaved boy in the school, and for this reason the\nteacher selected him to occupy a vacant place beside the girls. Some\nother boys were jealous of this, and after calling Brown a milk-sop,\nattacked him with snowballs. John proved himself as good a fighter then\nas he did afterwards at Black Jack. He made two or three snow-balls,\nrushed in at close quarters, and fought with such energy that he finally\ndrove all the boys before him.",
        "Elizur Wright may have taken note of this affair, and it served him when\nhe entered Yale College in 1822. He had never heard of hazing, and when\nthe Sophomores came to his room to tease him, he received them with true\nWestern cordiality. He found out his mistake quickly enough, and at the\nfirst insult he rose in wrath and ordered them out with such furious\nlooks that they concluded it was best to go.",
        "He helped to support himself during his college course not only by\nteaching in winter, but by making fires, waiting on table, and ringing\nthe recitation bell. In spite of these menial services, he was popular in\nhis class and had a number of aristocratic friends,—among them Philip\nVan Rensselaer. He was one of the best scholars in his class,—first in\nmathematics, and so fluent in Greek that to the end of his life he could\nread it with ease.",
        "He did not wait for graduation. In May, 1826, the Groton Academy suddenly\nwanted a teacher, and Elizur Wright was invited to take the position. The\ncollege faculty sent him his degree a month later,—which they might not\nhave done if they had known how little he cared for it. In his school at\nGroton was a pretty, dark-eyed girl named Susan Clark, who, for two years\npreviously, had been at school with Margaret Fuller and was very well\nacquainted with her. Elizur Wright became interested in Miss Clark, and\nthree years later they were married.",
        "One day, while he was living at Groton, Mr. Wright went by the Boston\nstage to Fitchburg, and on his return held a long conversation with a\nfellow-passenger, a tall, slender young man with aquiline features, who\ngave his name as Ralph Waldo Emerson. Mr. Wright found him an exceedingly\ninteresting gentleman, but of so fragile an appearance that it seemed\nimpossible that he should live many years.",
        "From this time the paths of these two young scholars diverged. Emerson\nbecame an idealist and an ethical reformer. Elizur Wright became a\nrealist and a political reformer. Realism seems to belong to the soil of\nOhio.",
        "Ill health came next in turn, a natural consequence of his severe life at\nYale College. He was obliged to leave his school, and for an occupation\nhe circulated tracts for the American Congregational Society, making a\nstipulation, however, which was characteristic of him, that he should not\ndistribute any that ran contrary to his convictions. In this itinerant\nfashion he became sufficiently recuperated at the end of a year to marry\nMiss Clark, September 13, 1829, and accept the professorship of\nmathematics at Western Reserve College, at Hudson, Ohio. There he\nremained till 1833, strengthening himself in the repose of matrimony for\nthe conflict that lay before him,—a conflict that every justice-loving\nman feels that he will have to face at one time or another.",
        "This probably came sooner than he expected. Some anti-slavery tracts,\ncirculated by Garrison, reached Western Reserve College and set the place\nin a ferment. Elizur Wright became the champion of the anti-slavery\nmovement, not only in the town of Hudson but throughout the State. What\nGarrison was in New England he became in the West. In the spring of 1833\nhe resigned his professorship and spent the next five months delivering\nlectures on the slavery question. In December of the same year the first\nnational anti-slavery convention met in Philadelphia, and Elizur Wright\nwas unanimously chosen secretary of it. After that he went to New York to\nedit a newspaper, the Anti-Slavery Reporter, remaining until 1839.\nDuring the pro-slavery riot in New York he was attacked on the sidewalk\nby two men with knives, but instantly rescued by some teamsters who were\npassing. When he reached his home in Brooklyn he found a note from the\nMayor advising him to leave the city for some days; to which he replied\nadvising the Mayor to stop the New York ferry-boats. Meanwhile, as Mrs.\nWright was too ill to be removed, he purchased an axe and prepared to\ndefend his house to the last extremity. The Mayor, however, adopted his\nadvice, and by this excellent stratagem Brooklyn was saved from the fury\nof the mob. In 1837 he moved to Dorchester, Massachusetts, to prosecute a\nsimilar work in Boston.",
        "Nothing is more remarkable in Mr. Wright’s life than his perfect self-\npoise and peace of mind during such a long period of external agitation.\nIt is doubtful, in spite of his highly nervous temperament, if he ever\nlost a night’s sleep. When he was editing the Chronotype, and\nwaiting for the telegraphic news to arrive, he would sometimes lie down\non a pile of newspapers and go to sleep in less than half a minute. For\nmental relaxation he studied the higher mathematics and wrote poetry—\nmuch of it very good. His faith in Divine Providence was absolute. He had\nthe soul of a hero.",
        "During his first years in Boston, Elizur Wright translated La Fontaine’s\nFables into English verse,—one of the best metrical versions of a\nforeign poet,—and it is much to be regretted that the book is out of\nprint. It did not sell, of course, and Elizur Wright, determined that\nneither he nor the publisher should lose money on it, undertook to sell\nit himself. In carrying out this plan he met with some curious\nexperiences. He called on Professor Ticknor, who received him kindly,\nspoke well of his translation, offered to dispose of a number of copies,\nbut—advised him to keep clear of the slavery question.",
        "He went to Washington with the twofold object of selling his book and\ntalking emancipation to our national legislators; and he succeeded in\nboth attempts, for there were few men who liked to argue with Elizur\nWright. His brain was a store-house of facts and his analysis of them\nequally keen and cutting. One Congressman, a very gentlemanly Virginian,\nsaid to him: “Mr. Wright, I wish you could go across the Potomac and look\nover my district. I think you will find that African slavery is not half\nas bad as it is represented.” Elizur Wright went and returned with the\nemphatic reply: “I find it much worse than I expected.” Having disposed\nof more than half of his edition in this manner, in the spring of 1842 he\nwent to England, and with the kind assistance of Browning and Pringle\nsucceeded in placing the rest of his books there to his satisfaction.\nHaving a great admiration for Wordsworth’s poetry, he made a long journey\nto see that celebrated author, but only to be affronted by Wordsworth’s\nsaying that America would be a good place if there were only a few\ngentlemen in it. With Carlyle he had, as might have been expected, a\nfurious argument on the slavery question, and “King Thomas,” as Dr.\nHolmes calls him, encountered for once a head as hard as his own. The\nBrownings, Robert and Elizabeth, received him with true English\nhospitality. More experienced than Wordsworth in the great world, they\nrecognized Elizur Wright to be what he was,—a man of intellect and rare\nintegrity. Mr. Wright always spoke of Browning as one of the most\nsatisfactory men with whom he had ever conversed.",
        "In 1840, as is well known, the anti-slavery movement became divided into\nthose who still believed in the efficacy of “moral suasion” and those who\nconsidered that the time had come for introducing the question into\npractical politics. The Texas question made the latter course inevitable,\nand Elizur Wright concluded that moral suasion had done its work. As he\nexpressed it, in a letter to Mrs. Maria Chapman: “Garrison has already\nleft his enemies thrice dead behind him.” He was a delegate to the\nconvention of April 1, 1840, which nominated James G. Birney for the\nPresidency, and took an active share in the Free-soil movement of 1844,—\na movement which produced exactly the opposite effect from that which was\nintended; for the defeat of Henry Clay opened the door for the Mexican\nwar and the annexation of a much larger territory than Texas. If Clay had\nbeen elected, the history of the United States must have been different\nfrom what it has proved.",
        "How Elizur Wright supported his family during this long period of\nphilanthropy will always be a mystery, but support them he did. He had no\nregular salary like Garrison, but, in an emergency, he could turn his\nhand to almost anything, and earn money by odd jobs. Fortunately, he had\na wife who was not afraid of any kind of house-work. He purchased his\nclothes of a tailor named Curtis, who kept a sailors’ clothing store on\nNorth Street, and his mode of living otherwise was not less economical.",
        "That his children suffered by their father’s philanthropy must be\nadmitted, but it is a general rule that the families of public\nbenefactors also contribute largely to the general good. His eldest\ndaughters inherited their father’s intellect, and as they grew up\ncheerfully assisted him in various ways.",
        "When the Mexican war began there was great indignation over it in New\nEngland, and Lowell wrote his most spirited verses in opposition to it.\nElizur Wright took advantage of the storm to establish a newspaper, the\nChronotype, in opposition to the Government policy. He began this\nenterprise almost without help, but soon obtained assistance from leading\nFree-soilers like John A. Andrew, Dr. S. G. Howe, and especially Frank W.\nBird, the most disinterested of politicians, who gave several thousand\ndollars in support of the Chronotype. The object of the paper,\nstated in Mr. Wright’s own words, was “To examine everything that is new\nand some things that are old, without fear or favor; to promote good\nnature, good neighborhood, and good government; to advocate a just\ndistribution of the proper reward, whether material or immaterial, both\nof honest labor and rascally violence, cunning and idleness; last, but\nnot least, to get an honest living.” In 1848 he had a list of six\nthousand subscribers; and his incisive pen was greatly feared. The\nPost, which was the Government organ in Boston, attacked him once,\nbut met with such a crushing rejoinder that its editor concluded not to\ntry that game again. His capacity for brain labor was wonderful. He could\nwork fourteen hours a day, and did not seem to need recreation at all.",
        "In the campaign of 1844 Elizur Wright made a number of speeches for the\nFree-soil candidate in various New England cities. One morning he was\nreturning from a celebration at Nashua, when at the Lowell station Daniel\nWebster entered the train with two or three friends, and turned over the\nseat next to Mr. Wright. A newsboy followed Webster, and they all\npurchased papers. Elizur Wright purchased a Whig paper, and seeing a\nstatement in it concerning the Free-soil candidate which he believed from\ninternal evidence to be untrue, he said quite loud: “Well! this is the\nfinest roorback I have met with.” Webster inquired what it was, and,\nafter looking at the statement, pronounced it genuine. A short argument\nensued, which closed with Webster’s proposing to bet forty pounds\nthat the allegation was true. “I am not a betting man,” replied Wright,\n\"but since the honor of my candidate is at stake, I accept your wager.\"\nWebster then gave him his card, and Wright returned it by writing\nhis name on a piece of the newspaper.",
        "Elizur Wright no sooner reached his office than he found letters and\ndocuments there disproving the Whig statement in toto, and later\nin the day he carried them over to Mr. Webster, who had an office in what\nwas then Niles’s Block. Mr. Webster looked carefully through them,\ncongratulated Mr. Wright on his good fortune, and handed him two hundred-\ndollar bills. Peter Harvey, who was in Webster’s office at the time,\nafterwards stopped Elizur Wright on the sidewalk and said to him: “Mr.\nWright, you could have afforded to lose that wager much better than\nWebster could.”",
        "It is remarkable how all the different interests in this man’s life—\nmathematics, philanthropy, journalism, and the translation of La\nFontaine—united together like so many different currents to further the\ngrand achievement of his life. While in England he had taken notice of\nthe life-insurance companies there, which were in a more advanced stage\nthan those in America. They interested him as a mathematical study, and\nalso from the humanitarian point of view. He purchased “David Jones on\nAnnuities,” and the best works on life insurance. These he read with the\nsame ardor with which young ladies devour an exciting novel, and without\nthe least expectation that they might ever bring dollars and cents to\nhim; until one day in the spring of 1852 an insurance solicitor placed an\nadvertising booklet in his hand as he was entering the office of the\nChronotype.",
        "Elizur Wright looked it over and perceived quickly enough that no company\ncould undertake to do what this one pretended to and remain solvent. The\nbooklet served him for an editorial, and before one o’clock the next day\nagents from every life company in Boston were collected in his office.\nThey supposed at first that it was an attempt at blackmail, but soon\ndiscovered that Elizur Wright knew more about the subject than any of\nthem. Neither threats nor persuasions had any effect on this\nuncompromising backwoodsman. Only on one condition would Mr. Wright\nretract his statements,—that the companies should reform their circulars\nand place their affairs in a more sound condition. The consequence of\nthis was an invitation from the presidents of several of the companies\nfor Mr. Wright to call at their offices and discuss the subject with\nthem.",
        "The situation was this, and Mr. Wright saw it clearly: the presidents of\nthe companies were excellent men,—as honorable and trustworthy as the\npresidents of our best national banks,—and they knew how to organize and\nconduct their companies in all business matters, but of life insurance as\na science they knew as little as they knew of Greek. In those days there\nwas a prejudice against college graduates which prevented their obtaining\nthe highest mercantile positions, and it is doubtful if there was any\nperson connected with the life-insurance companies who could solve a\nproblem in the higher mathematics. The consequence of this was that it\nplaced the presidents quite at the mercy of their own accountants. Recent\nevents have proved with what facility the teller of a bank can abstract\ntwenty or thirty thousand dollars without its appearing in the accounts.\nTemptations and opportunities of this sort must have been much greater in\nlife-insurance companies, as they were formerly conducted, than it is now\nin banks. Money may have been stolen without its having been discovered.",
        "Besides this, the temptations of the companies to continually over-bid\none another for public favor was another evil which, sooner or later,\nwould lead some of them into bankruptcy. This danger could only be\naverted by placing their rates of insurance on a scientific basis, which\nshould be the same and unalterable for all companies.",
        "The charters of the companies had been drafted in the interest of the\nmanagement, without much consideration for the rights or advantages of\nthose who were insured. There were no laws on the statute book which\nwould practically prevent directors of life-insurance companies from\ndoing as they pleased with the immense trust properties in their\npossession. After two or three interviews with Elizur Wright the\npresidents of the companies came to the conclusion that he was exactly\nthe man that they wanted, and they commissioned him to draw up a revised\nset of tables and rates which could serve them for a uniform standard.\nThis work occupied him and two of his daughters for a full year, for\nwhich he was compensated with the paltry sum of two thousand dollars. The\ntime was fast approaching, however, when Elizur Wright would be in a\nposition to dictate his own terms to the insurance companies.",
        "It was now that the Bird Club, the most distinguished political club of\nits time, became gradually formed out of the leading elements of the\nFree-soil party. At one time this club counted among its members two\nSenators, three Governors, and a number of Congressmen, and it was a\npower in the land. Elizur Wright’s services as editor of the\nChronotype gave him an early entrance to it; and having life\ninsurance on the brain, as it were, other members of the club soon became\ninterested in the subject as a political question. In this way Mr. Wright\nwas soon able to effect legislation. Sumner, Wilson, Andrew, and Bird\ngave him an almost unqualified support. In 1858 he was appointed\nInsurance Commissioner for Massachusetts, a position which he held until\n1866. As Commissioner he formulated the principal legislation on life\ninsurance; and his reports, which have been published in a volume, are\nthe best treatise in English on the practical application of life-\ninsurance principles.",
        "In 1852 he resigned the editorship of the Chronotype, and from\nthat time till 1858 he was occupied with life-insurance work, the editing\nof a paper called the Railroad Times, and making a number of\nmechanical inventions, most important of which was a calculating machine,\nenough in itself to give a man distinction.",
        "This machine was simply a Gunther rule thirty feet in length wrapped on a\ncylinder and turned by a crank. Gunther’s rule is a measure on which\nlogarithms are represented by spaces, so that by adding and subtracting\nspaces on this cylinder Mr. Wright could perform the longest sums in\nmultiplication and division in two or three minutes of time.",
        "Not only did the Massachusetts insurance companies come under Mr.\nWright’s surveillance, but the New York Life, the Connecticut Mutual, and\nthe Mutual Benefit of New Jersey, all large and powerful companies, were\nobliged to conform to his regulations, for their Boston offices were too\nlucrative to be surrendered. About this time Gladstone caused an\noverhauling of the English life-insurance companies, and a number which\nproved to be unsound were obliged to surrender their charters. Among\nthese latter were two companies which held offices in Boston, and whose\ncharacter had already been exposed by Elizur Wright.",
        "In 1850, when he became Commissioner, Mr. Wright sent to their agents for\na statement of their financial standing, and not receiving a reply\nrequested them to leave the State. Finding that the matter could not be\nevaded, they at length forwarded two reports signed by two actuaries,\nboth Fellows of the Royal Society, which were not of a satisfactory\ncharacter, so that Mr. Wright insisted on his previous order. The agents\nthen applied for support to Prof. Benjamin Pierce, the distinguished\nmathematician of Harvard University, and one of the most aggressively\npro-slavery men about Boston. He probably looked upon Elizur Wright as a\nvulgar fanatic, and supposing that a Fellow of the Royal Society must\nnecessarily be an honorable man, came forward in support of Messrs.\nNeisen and Woolhouse without sufficiently investigating the question at\nissue; and the result was a controversy between Elizur Wright and himself\nin which he was finally beaten off the field.",
        "The statements of both Neisen and Woolhouse was proved to be fraudulent,\nand the two English companies were expelled from the State.",
        "Mr. Wright’s insurance reports brought him such celebrity that all the\ncompanies wished to have his name connected with them. His son, Walter C.\nWright, became actuary of the New England Life, and his daughter, Miss\nJane Wright, was made actuary of the Mutual Union Company. Mr. Wright and\nhis eldest son, John, set up a business for calculating the value of\ninsurance policies, in which the logarithm machine helped them to obtain\na large income. With his first ten thousand dollars Mr. Wright purchased\na large house and a tract of land in Middlesex Fells, where his family\nstill resides.",
        "In 1865 the office of Life Insurance Commissioner was filched from him by\na trade politician who knew as much of the subject as fresh college\ngraduates do of the practical affairs of life. Mr. Wright always\nregretted this, for he felt that his work was not yet complete; and it is\na fact that American life insurance, with its good and bad features,\nstill remains almost exactly as he left it.",
        "It was only after Elizur Wright had ceased to be Commissioner that he\ndiscovered a serious error in the calculation of the companies, which may\nbe explained in the following manner:",
        "In the beginning, nearly all the insurance policies were made payable at\ndeath, with annual premiums; but the introduction of endowment policies,\npayable at a certain age, effected a peculiar change in their affairs, of\nwhich the managers of the companies were not sensible. Elizur Wright\nperceived that there were two distinct elements in the endowment policies\nwhich placed them at a disadvantage with ordinary life policies, and he\ncalled this combination “savings-bank life insurance.” An endowment\npolicy, being payable at a fixed date, required a larger premium than one\nwhich ran on indefinitely and by customary usage, and the agent who\nnegotiated the policy received the same percentage for commission that he\nwould on an ordinary-life policy; that is, he received a much larger\ncommission in proportion. This evil was increased in cases where\nendowment policies were paid for, as often happened, in five or ten\ninstalments; and where they were paid for in a single instalment the\nagent received four or five times what he was properly entitled to.",
        "The same principle was observed by the companies in the distribution of\ntheir surplus, so that the holders of endowment policies were practically\nmulcted at both ends of the line.",
        "In his reports as Insurance Commissioner Elizur Wright had recommended\nthis class of policies as a salutary provision against poverty in old\nage, and he felt under obligations to the public to correct this\ninjustice, [Footnote: On a policy of ten thousand dollars, it would\namount to an appreciable sum.] but the insurance agents had also\nadvocated them for evident reasons and were naturally opposed to any\nproject of reform. The managers of the companies also treated the subject\ncoldly, for the discrimination against endowments enabled them to\naccumulate a larger reserve which made them appear to better advantage\nbefore the general public. The numerous agents and solicitors formed a\nsolid body of opposition and raised a chorus against Elizur Wright like\nthat which the robins make when you pick your own cherries. This class of\npersons when they are actuated by a common impulse make a formidable\nimpression.",
        "Mr. Wright, after arguing his case with the insurance companies for\nnearly a year without effect, appealed to the public through the\nnewspapers. This, however, had unexpected consequences. Mr. Wright’s\nletters produced the impression, which he did not intend at all, that the\ninsurance companies were unsound, and policy-holders rushed to the\noffices to make inquiries. Many surrendered their policies.",
        "In this emergency the officers of the companies went to the editors and\nexplained to them that their business would be ruined if Mr. Wright was\npermitted to continue his attacks on them. They then made Mr. Wright what\nmay have been intended for a magnanimous offer, though he did not look on\nit in that light,—namely, an offer of ten thousand dollars a year, if he\nwould retire from the actuary business and not molest them any longer.\n[Footnote: These events took place thirty years ago and have no relation\nto the present condition and practice of American insurance companies.]\nElizur Wright refused this, as he might have declined the offer of a\ncigar, and appealed to the Legislature. The companies then withdrew their\nbusiness from Mr. Wright and thus reduced his income from twelve thousand\ndollars a year to about three thousand; but this troubled him no more\nthan it would have Diogenes.",
        "In the summer of 1872 a portly gentleman called at Elizur Wright’s office\non State Street and introduced himself as the president of a well-known\nWestern insurance company. As it was a pleasant day Mr. Wright invited\nhis visitor to Pine Hill, where they could converse to better advantage\nthan in a Boston office; but being much absorbed in his subject, while\npassing through Medford Centre, he neglected to order a dinner; and the\nconsequence of this was that his portly friend was obliged to make a\nlunch on cold meat and potato salad. That same evening Mr. Wright’s\ndaughter twitted him on his lack of forethought, and hoped such a thing\nwould not happen again, to which he only replied: “The kindest thing you\ncan do for such a man is to starve him.” Such was his philosophy on all\noccasions.",
        "He devised a plan for combining life insurance with a savings bank, by\nwhich the laboring man could obtain a certain amount of insurance for his\nfamily (or old age) instead of interest upon his deposits. This was an\nadmirable idea, and if he had undertaken to carry it out in the prime of\nlife he might have succeeded in realizing it; but he was now upwards of\nseventy, and his friends concluded that the experiment would be a risky\none, as a favorable result would depend entirely on Mr. Wright’s\nlongevity. At the same time he had another enterprise in hand, namely, to\nconvert the Middlesex Fells, in which Pine Hill is situated, into a\npublic park. This was greatly needed for the crowded population on the\nnorthern side of Boston, and though the plan was not carried out until\nafter his death, he was the originator and earliest promoter of it.",
        "Elizur Wright’s most conspicuous trait was generosity. He lived for the\nworld and not for himself. He was a man of broad views and great designs;\na daring, original thinker. He respected Emerson, but preferred the\nphilosophy of John Stuart Mill, from the study of which he became an\nadvocate of free trade and woman suffrage.",
        "He died November 21, 1885, in the midst of a rain-storm which lasted six\ndays and nights. He lies interred at Mt. Hope Cemetery.",
        "A distinguished American called upon Charles Darwin, and in the course\nof conversation asked him what he considered the most important discovery\nof the nineteenth century. To which Mr. Darwin replied, after a slight\nhesitation: “Painless surgery.” He thought this more beneficial in its\neffects on human affairs than either the steam-engine or the telegraph.\nLet it also be noted that he spoke of it as an invention, rather than as\na discovery.",
        "The person to whom all scientific men now attribute the honor of this\ndiscovery, or invention, is Dr. William T. G. Morton; and, although in\nthat matter he was not without slight assistance from others, as well as\npredecessors in the way of tentative experiments, yet it was Doctor\nMorton who first proved the possibility of applying anaesthesia to\nsurgical operations of a capital order; and it was he who pushed his\ntheory to a practical success. It may also be admitted that Columbus\ncould not have discovered the Western Hemisphere without the assistance\nof Ferdinand and Isabella; but it was Columbus who divined the existence\nof the American continent, and afterwards proved his theory to be true.\nThere is an underlying similarity between the labors and lives of\nColumbus and Morton, in spite of large superficial differences.",
        "William Thomas Greene Morton was born August 19, 1819, in Charlton,\nMassachusetts, a small town in the Connecticut Valley. His father was a\nflourishing farmer and lived in an old-fashioned but commodious country\nhouse, with a large square chimney in the centre of it. William was not\nonly a bright but a very dexterous boy, and was sent to school in the\nacademy at Northfield, and afterwards at Leicester. It is a family\ntradition that he early showed an experimental tendency by brewing\nconcoctions of various kinds for the benefit of his young companions, and\nthat he once made his sister deathly sick in this manner. His father,\nfinding him a more energetic boy than the average of farmers’ sons,\nadvised him to go to Boston, to seek whatever fortune he could find\nthere.",
        "This resulted in his obtaining employment, probably through the Charlton\nclergyman, in the office of a religious periodical, the Christian\nWitness; but the situation, though a comfortable one, was not adapted\nto his tastes, and from some unexplained attraction to the profession, he\ndecided to study dentistry. This he accordingly did, graduating at the\nBaltimore Dental College in 1842. He then engaged an office in Boston,\nand soon acquired a lucrative practice. He was an uncommonly handsome\nman, with a determined look in his eye, but also a kindly expression and\npleasing manners, which may have brought him more practice than his skill\nin dentistry,—although that was also good.",
        "The following year he was married to Miss Elizabeth Whitman, of\nFarmington, Connecticut, whose uncle, at least, had been a member of\nCongress,—a highly genteel family in that region. In fact, her parents\nobjected to Doctor Morton on account of his profession, and it was only\nafter his promise to study medicine and become a regular practitioner\nthat they consented to the match. Accordingly, Doctor Morton in the\nautumn of 1844 commenced a course at the Harvard Medical-School.",
        "Mrs. Morton was a handsome young woman, with a fair face and elegant\nfigure. It would have been difficult to find a better looking couple\nanywhere in the suburbs, and with good health and strength it seemed as\nif fortune would certainly smile on them. Doctor Morton built a summer\ncottage at Wellesley, where the public library now stands, and planted a\ngrove of trees about it; but a mere earthly paradise could not satisfy\nhim. He was not an ambitious man, or he would not have chosen the dental\nprofession; but the food he lived on was not of this world. He had the\ndaring spirit, the speculative temperament, and restless energy of the\nborn discoverer. Already he had made improvements in the manufacture of\nartificial teeth. He was the first, or one of the first, to recognize the\nimportance of chemistry in connection with the practice of medicine. He\nhad no sooner returned to Boston than he commenced the study of chemistry\nwith Dr. Charles T. Jackson, spending from six to ten hours a week in his\nlaboratory; and he thus became acquainted with the properties and\npeculiarities of most of the chemical ingredients known at that time.",
        "Mrs. Morton soon discovered with awe and trepidation that she had married\nno ordinary man. That he had a real skeleton in his closet was to have\nbeen expected; but, besides this, there were rows of mysterious-looking\nbottles, with substances in them quite different from the medicines which\nwere prescribed by the doctors in Farmington. He tried experiments on\ntheir black water-spaniel and nearly killed him; and even descended to\nfishes and insects. He would muse for hours by himself, and if she asked\nhim what he was thinking of he gave her no explanation that she could\nunderstand. Although he was so attractive and pleasing, he did not care\nmuch for human society. [Footnote: McClure’s Magazine, September, 1896.]\nHe was kind and good to her, and with that she was content. A more\ndevoted wife, or faithful mother, has not been portrayed in poetry or\nromance.",
        "These phenomena in Doctor Morton’s early life remind one of certain\nprocesses in the budding of a flower. They indicate a tendency to some\nobject which perhaps was not at the time wholly clear to the man himself.\nImpelled by the humanitarian spirit of the age, he moved forward with a\nclear eye and firm hand to grasp the opportunity when it arrived,—nor\nwas it long delayed.",
        "In considering the discovery of etherization we ought to eliminate all\nevidence of an ex parte character, unless it is supported\ncircumstantially; but there is no reason why we should disbelieve Mrs.\nMorton’s statement that her husband made experiments with sulphuric\nether; that his clothes smelt of it; and that he tried to persuade\nlaboring-men to allow him to experiment upon them with it. As Dr. J.\nCollins Warren says: “Anaesthesia had been the dream of many surgeons and\nscientists, but it had been classed with aerial navigation and other\nimprobable inventions.” [Footnote: Anaesthesia in Surgery, 15.] As long\nago as 1818 Faraday had discovered the chief properties of ether, with\nthe exception of its effect in deadening sensibility. In 1836 Dr. Morrill\nWyman and Dr. Samuel Parkman had experimented with it on themselves at\nthe Massachusetts Hospital, but without taking a sufficient quantity to\nproduce unconsciousness. It was actually employed in 1842 by Dr. Crawford\nW. Long, at the University of Pennsylvania, in some minor cases of\nsurgery, but he would seem to have lost confidence in his method and\nafterwards abandoned it.",
        "In December, 1844, Horace Wells, a dentist of Hartford, had a tooth\nextracted by his own request while under the influence of nitrous oxide;\nand the following month he came to Boston, and having made his discovery\nknown, an operation at the hospital was undertaken with his assistance,\nbut the patient screamed, and it proved a failure so far as anaesthesia\nwas concerned.",
        "From these facts we readily draw the following conclusions: That the\ndiscovery of painless surgery was essentially a practical affair for\nwhich only a slight knowledge of chemistry was required; that it was not\na discovery made at hap-hazard, but one that necessitated a skilful hand\nand a clear understanding of the subject; and that the supposition which\nhas sometimes been advanced that Doctor Morton was necessarily indebted\nto Doctor Jackson for a knowledge of the hypnotic effect of ether is\nwholly gratuitous.",
        "We will now quote directly from Doctor Warren’s lecture on “The Influence\nof Anaesthesia on the Surgery of the Nineteenth Century,” delivered\nbefore the American Surgical Association in 1897:",
        "“Morton having acquainted himself by conversation with Mr. Metcalf and\nMr. Burnett, both leading druggists, as to purity and qualities of ether,\nand having also conversed with Mr. Wightman, a philosophical instrument-\nmaker, and with Doctor Jackson as to inhaling apparatus, proceeded to\nexperiment upon himself. After inhaling the purer quality of ether from a\nhandkerchief he awoke to find that he had been insensible for seven or\neight minutes.",
        "“The same day a stout, healthy man came to his office suffering from\ngreat pain and desiring to have a tooth extracted. Dreading the pain, ho\naccepted willingly Morton’s proposal to use ether, and the tooth was\nextracted without suffering. Morton reported his success the next day to\nJackson, and conversed with him as to the best methods of bringing his\ndiscovery to the attention of the medical profession and the public.\nJackson pointed out that tooth-pulling was not a sufficient test, as many\npeople claimed to have teeth pulled without pain. It was finally decided\nthat the crucial test lay in a public demonstration in the operating\ntheatre of a hospital in a surgical case.”",
        "There is one statement in the above to which, according to our rules of\nliterary procedure, we feel obliged to take exception,—that is, the\nstatement concerning the interview between Morton and Jackson after the\nsuccessful administration of ether to Morton’s patient. It is\nsubstantially Doctor Jackson’s own statement. Doctor Morton gave a wholly\ndifferent account before the Congressional Committee of 1852. He said:",
        "“I went to Doctor Jackson, told him what I had done, and asked him\nto give me a certificate that ether was harmless in its effects. This\nhe positively refused to do. I then told him I should go to the principal\nsurgeons and have the question thoroughly tried. I then called on Doctor\nWarren, who promised me an early opportunity to try the experiment, and\nsoon after I received the invitation....“",
        "Now as these are both ex parte statements, and as there are no\nwitnesses on either side, according to the rule we have already\nestablished, they will both have to be eliminated. [Footnote: The\nCongressional Committee of 1852 did not find Doctor Jackson’s report of\nthis interview trustworthy.] Doctor Morton, however, says previously that\nit was Doctor Hayward with whom he consulted as to the best method of\nbringing his discovery before the world.",
        "In the consideration of this subject we come upon a man of rare\ncharacter—rare even, in his profession. Dr. John C. Warren was the\nperfect type of an Anglo-Saxon surgeon. His courage and dexterity were\nfully equalled by his kindness and sympathy for the patient. Cool and\ncollected in the most trying emergencies, it has been said of him that he\nnever performed a capital operation without feeling a pain in his heart;\nand the evidence of this was marked upon his face, so that it is even\nvisible in the photographs of him. He deserved to have his portrait\npainted by Rubens. In 1847 Dr. Mason Warren published a review of\netherization, in which he makes this important statement:",
        "“In the autumn of 1846 Dr. W. T. G. Morton, a dentist in Boston, a person\nof great ingenuity, patience, and pertinacity of purpose, called on me\nseveral times to show some of his inventions. At that time I introduced\nhim to Dr. John C. Warren. Shortly after, in October, I learned from\nDoctor Warren that Doctor Morton had visited him and informed him that he\nwas in possession of or had discovered a means of preventing pain, which\nhe had proved in dental operations, and wished Doctor Warren to give him\nan opportunity in a surgical operation. After some questions on the\nsubject in regard to its action and the safety of it, Doctor Warren\npromised that he would do so.... The operation was therefore deferred\nuntil Friday, October 16, when the ether was administered by Doctor\nMorton, and the operation performed by Doctor Warren.”",
        "It was eminently fitting that Dr. John C. Warren should be the one to\nintroduce painless surgery to the medical profession. Next to Morton he\ndeserves the highest credit for the revolution which it effected: a\nglorious revolution, fully equal to that of 1688. His quick recognition\nof Morton’s character, and the confidence he placed in him as the man of\nthe hour, deserve the highest commendation. Doctor Warren had invited\nDoctor Jackson to attend this critical experiment with sulphuric ether at\nthe Massachusetts Hospital; but he declined with the trite excuse that he\nwas obliged to go out of town. This has been generally interpreted by the\nmedical profession as a lack of courage on Jackson’s part to face the\nmusic, but it may also have been owing to his jealousy of Morton.",
        "This happened October 16th, and on November 13th, Dr. C. T. Jackson wrote\nto M. Elie de Beaumont, a member of the French Academy, this remarkable\nletter:",
        "“I request permission to communicate through your medium to the Academy\nof Sciences a discovery which I have made, and which I believe important\nfor the relief of suffering humanity, as well as of great value to the\nsurgical profession. Five or six years ago I noticed the peculiar state\nof insensibility into which the nervous system is thrown by the\ninhalation of the vapor of pure sulphuric ether, which I respired\nabundantly,—first by way of experiments, and afterwards when I had a\nsevere catarrh, caused by the inhalation of chlorine gas. I have latterly\nmade a useful application of this fact by persuading a dentist of this\ncity to administer the vapor of ether to his patients, when about to\nundergo the operation of extraction of teeth. It was observed that\npersons suffered no pain in the operation, and that no inconvenience\nresulted from the administration of the vapor.”",
        "It was the opinion of Robert Rantoul and other members of the\nCongressional Committee that Doctor Jackson suffered from a “heated and\ndisordered imagination,” and that is the most charitable view that one\ncan take of such a letter as this. Whatever may have been the result of\nDoctor Jackson’s investigations with sulphuric ether, it is certain that\nhe added nothing to the scientific knowledge of his time in that respect;\n[Footnote: Edinburgh Medical Journal, April 1, 1857.] and if he persuaded\nDoctor Morton to make use of it, why was he not present to oversee his\nsubordinate? also, why did he make a charge on his books a few days later\nagainst Doctor Morton of five hundred dollars for advice and information\nconcerning the application of ether? It is not customary to charge\nsubordinates for their service but to reward them. The two horns of this\ndilemma are sharp and penetrating.",
        "In a later memorial of the same general tenor, which Doctor Jackson\nforwarded to Baron Humboldt, he stated that he had applied to other\ndentists in Boston to make the experiment of etherization, but found them\nunwilling to take the risk; but the names of the dentists have never been\nmade public, nor did any such appear afterwards to testify in Doctor\nJackson’s behalf.",
        "Still more remarkable was the action of the French Academy of Arts and\nSciences in these premises. The French Academy was founded by Richelieu,\nbut abolished in the first French Revolution, with so many other\nenchanted phantasms. Napoleon re-established it, and gave it new life and\nvigor by a discriminating choice of membership; but it is a close\ncorporation which renews itself by its own votes, and such a body of men\nis always in danger of becoming a mutual admiration society, and if this\nhappens its public utility is at an end. In the present instance the\naction of the French Academy was illogical, unscientific, and\nmischievous.",
        "Doctor Jackson’s letter was brought before that august body on January\n18, 1847, but previous to that time Doctor Warren had written to Doctor\nVelpeau, an eminent French surgeon, concerning the success of\netherization at the Massachusetts Hospital, and suggesting the use of it\nin the hospitals at Paris; and Doctor Velpeau referred to this fact at\nthe meeting of January 18th. The contents of this letter have never been\nmade public; but it is incredible that Doctor Jackson’s claim should have\nreceived any support from it. Nevertheless, the members of the French\nAcademy decided to divide one of the Mouthyon prizes (of five thousand\nfrancs for great scientific discoveries) between Dr. W. T. G. Morton and\nElie de Beaumont’s American friend, Dr. C. T. Jackson; and they\nconferred this particular favor on Dr. Jackson at his own\nrepresentation, without one witness in his favor, and without making an\ninquiry into the circumstances of the discovery. Could the Northfield\nAcademy of boys and girls have acted in a more heedless or unscientific\nmanner?",
        "After the justice of this decision had been questioned, the French\nAcademy promulgated a defence of their previous action, of which the\nessence was that the scientific theory of Doctor Jackson was as essential\nto the discovery of etherization as the practical skill of Doctor Morton;\nthat is, they attempted to decide a matter of fact by an a priori\ndogmatism. Was not the instruction that Doctor Morton received from the\ndental college in Baltimore also essential to the discovery,—and to go\nbehind that,—what he learned at the primary school at Churiton? When\nlearning is divorced from reason it becomes mere pedantry or sublimated\nignorance, and is more dangerous to the community than unlettered\nignorance can be.",
        "This blunder of the French Academy had evil consequences for both Morton\nand Jackson; for it placed the latter in a false position towards the\nworld, and brought about a collision between them which not only lasted\nduring their lives, but was also carried on by their friends and\nrelatives long afterwards. It is doubtful if Jackson would have contested\nMorton’s claim without European support.",
        "With true dignity of character Doctor Morton declined to divide the\nMouthyon prize with Doctor Jackson, and the French Academy accordingly\nhad a large gold medal stamped in his honor, and as this did not exhaust\nthe original donation, the remainder of the sum was expended on a highly\nornamental case. The trustees of the Massachusetts Hospital partly\nsubscribed and partly collected a thousand dollars which they presented\nto Doctor Morton in a handsome silver casket. The King of Sweden sent him\nthe Cross of the Order of Wasa; and he also received the Cross of the\nOrder of St. Vladimir from the Tsar of Russia. He was only twenty-seven\nyears of age at this time.",
        "The ensuing eight years of Morton’s life were spent in a desperate effort\nfor recognition—recognition of the importance of his discovery and of\nhis own merits as the discoverer. No one can blame him for this. As\nevents proved, it would have been far better for him if he had finished\nhis course at the medical-school and set up his sign in the vicinity of\nBeacon Street; but the wisest man can but dimly foresee the future.\nDoctor Morton had every reason to believe that there was a fortune to be\nmade in etherization. He consulted Rufus Choate, who advised him to\nobtain a patent or proprietary right in his discovery. Hon. Caleb Eddy\nundertook to do this for him, and being supported by a sound opinion from\nDaniel Webster, easily obtained it. Now, however, Morton’s troubles\nbegan.",
        "He exempted the Massachusetts Hospital from the application of his\nroyalty, and it was only right that he should do so; but, unfortunately,\nit was the only large hospital where etherization was regularly\npractised. In order to extend its application Doctor Morton secured the\nservices of three young physicians, practised them in the use of the gas,\nand paid them a thousand dollars each to go forth into the world as\nproselytes of his discovery; but they met everywhere with a cold\nreception, and were several times informed that if the Massachusetts\nHospital enjoyed the use of etherization, other hospitals ought to have\nthe same privilege; so that his enterprise proved of no immediate\nadvantage.",
        "The Mexican War was now at its height, and Doctor Morton offered the use\nof etherization to the government for a very small royalty, but his offer\nwas declined by the Secretary of War. He soon discovered, however, that\nsurgeons in the army and navy were making free use of it,—contrary to\nlaw and the rights of men. Individuals all over the country—dentists and\nsurgeons—were doing the same thing; and it was more difficult to prevent\nthis than to execute the game-laws. For such an order of affairs the\ndecision of the French Academy was largely responsible, for if men only\nfind a shadow of right on the side of self-interest, they are likely\nenough to take advantage of it.",
        "Meanwhile Doctor Jackson, with a few friends and a large body of\nHomoeopaths who acted in opposition to the regulars of the Massachusetts\nHospital, kept up a continual fusillade against Doctor Morton; but this\ndid him little harm, for early in 1847 the trustees of the hospital\ndecided, by a unanimous vote, that the honor of discovering etherization\nproperly belonged to him.",
        "Doctor Jackson questioned the justice of this decision, and applied for a\nreconsideration of the subject. Whereupon the subject was reconsidered\nthe following year, and the same verdict rendered as before. Doctor\nJackson then carried his case to the Boston Academy of Arts and Sciences,\nwhen Professor Agassiz asked him the pertinent question: “But, Doctor\nJackson, did you make one little experiment?” adding drily, after\nreceiving a negative reply: “It would have been better if you had.”",
        "It is to be regretted that Doctor Jackson should have attacked Doctor\nMorton’s private life (which appears to have been fully as commendable as\nhis own), and also that R. W. Emerson should have entered the lists in\nfavor of his brother-in-law. In one of his later books Emerson designates\nDoctor Jackson as the discoverer of etherization. This was setting his\nown judgment above that of the legal and medical professions, and even\nabove the French Academy; but Emerson had lived so long in intuitions and\npoetical concepts that he was not a fairly competent person to judge of a\nmatter of fact. It is doubtful if he made use of the inductive method of\nreasoning during his life.",
        "Doctor Morton sought legal advice in regard to the infringement of his\npatent rights; but he found that legal proceedings in such cases were\nvery expensive, and was counselled to apply to Congress for redress and\nassistance. This seemed to him a good plan, for if he could exchange his\nrights in etherization for a hundred thousand dollars, he would be\nsatisfied; but in the end it proved a Nessus shirt to strangle the life\nout of him. He soon found that Congress could not be moved by a sense of\njustice, but only by personal influence. He gave up his business in\nBoston and went to Washington with his family, but this soon exhausted\nhis slender resources. Knowing devils informed him that if he wished to\nobtain a hundred thousand dollars from the government he would have to\nexpend fifteen or twenty thousand in lobbying, but the idea of this was\nhateful to him, and he declined to make the requisite pledges.",
        "The winter of 1850 and of 1851 passed without result, until finally in\nDecember of the latter year, Bissel, of Illinois, made a speech in Doctor\nMorton’s favor, calling attention to the fact that the government had\nbeen pirating his patent, and proposing that the subject be referred to a\ncommittee. Robert Rantoul seconded the motion, and the step was taken. It\nwas considered better for the chances of success that the proposition\nshould come from a Western man.",
        "This committee continued its meeting throughout the winter and made a\nthorough-going examination of the question before it. The frankness and\nplain character of Doctor Morton’s testimony is much in his favor, and\nthe description he gave of his own proceedings previous to the first\noperation in the Massachusetts Hospital show how hard he wrestled with\nhis discovery,—wrestled like Jacob of old,—working half the night with\nan instrument-maker to devise a suitable apparatus for inhalation. Doctor\nJackson and Horace Wells also presented their claims to the committee and\nwere respectfully considered.",
        "The report of this committee is a valuable document,—a study for young\nlawyers in the sifting of evidence,—and of itself a severe criticism on\nthe judgment of the French Academy, which it considered at too great a\ndistance to judge fairly of the circumstances attending the advent of\npainless surgery. The committee decided unanimously that Doctor Wells did\nnot carry his experiments far enough to reach a decided result; that\nDoctor Jackson’s testimony was contradictory and not much to be depended\non; and that the credit of discovering painless surgery properly\nappertained to Dr. W. T. G. Morton. They recommended an appropriation of\na hundred thousand dollars to be given to Doctor Morton in return for the\nfree use of etherization by the surgeons of the army and navy.",
        "A hundred thousand dollars was little enough. The British Government paid\nthirty thousand pounds as a gratuity for the discovery of vaccination;\nand more recently a poor German student made a much larger sum by the\ninvention of a drug which has since fallen into disuse. Half a million\nwould not have been more than Morton deserved, and a hundred thousand\nmight have been bestowed on Wells.",
        "Doctor Morton must have thought now that the clouds were lifting for him\nat last; but they soon settled down darker than ever. The committee’s\nreport was only printed towards the close of the session, and Congress,\ngone rabid over the Presidential election, neglected to consider it.\nNeither did it take further action the following winter. A year later a\nbill was introduced in the Senate for Doctor Morton’s relief, and was\nably supported by Douglas, of Illinois, and Hale, of New Hampshire. It\npassed the Senate by a small majority, but was defeated by the “mud-gods\"\nof the House—defeated by men who were pilfering the national treasury in\nsinecures for their relatives and supporters. In the history of our\ngovernment I know of nothing more disgraceful than this,—except the\nexculpation of Brooks for his assault on Sumner.",
        "Doctor Morton was a ruined man. His slender means had long since been\nexhausted, and he had been running in debt for the past two or three\nyears, as Hawthorne did at the old manse. Even his house at Wellesley was\nmortgaged. His business was gone, and his health was shattered. He felt\nas a man does in an earthquake. The government could not have treated him\nmore cruelly unless it had put him to death.",
        "It was now, as a final resort, that he went to see President Pierce,\nalways a kindly man, except where Kansas affairs were concerned; and\nPierce advised him to bring a suit for infringement of his rights against\na surgeon in the navy. Doctor Morton found a lawyer who was willing to\ntake the risk for a large share of the profits, and gained his case. His\nhouse was saved, but he returned to Wellesley poorer than when he came to\nBoston to seek his fortune, a youth of eighteen.",
        "There was great indignation at the Massachusetts Hospital when the result\nof Doctor Morton’s case before Congress was known there, and soon after\nhis return an effort was made to raise a substantial testimonial for him.\nThat noble-hearted physician, Dr. Henry I. Bowditch, interested himself\nso conspicuously in this that Doctor Morton named his youngest son for\nhim.",
        "A similar effort was made by the medical profession in New York city, and\na sufficient sum obtained to render Doctor Morton moderately comfortable\nduring the remainder of his earthly existence, and to educate his eldest\nson.",
        "Doctor Morton’s health was too much shattered for professional work now,\nand he resigned himself to his fate. He raised cattle at Wellesley, and\nimported fine cattle as a healthful out-of-door occupation. In the autumn\nof 1862 he joined the Army of the Potomac as a volunteer surgeon, and\napplied ether to more than two thousand wounded soldiers during the\nbattles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and the Wilderness. At the\nsame time Senator Wil- [*printer’s error—double line and missing text]\nrevive the gratuity for Morton in Congress, but the decision of the French\nAcademy was in men’s minds, and a vicious precedent proved stronger than\nreason.",
        "I saw Doctor Morton for the last time about nine months before his death;\nand the impression his appearance made on me was indelible. He was\nwalking in the path before his house with his eldest daughter, and he\nseemed like the victim of an old Greek tragedy—a noble Oedipus who had\nsolved the Sphynx’s riddle, attended by his faithful Antigone.",
        "In July, 1868, a torrid wave swept over the Northern States which carried\noff many frail and delicate persons in the large cities, and Doctor\nMorton was one of those who suffered from it. He happened to be in New\nYork City at the time, and went to Central Park to escape the feeling of\nsuffocation which oppressed him, but never returned alive. He now lies in\nMount Auburn Cemetery, with a modest monument over his grave erected by\nhis Boston friends, with this epitaph composed by Dr. Jacob Bigelow:",
        "INVENTOR AND REVEALER OF ANAESTHETIC INHALATION BY WHOM, PAIN IN SURGERY\nWAS ARRESTED AND ANNULLED BEFORE WHOM, IN ALL TIME, SURGERY WAS AGONY\nSINCE WHOM, SCIENCE HAS CONTROL OF PAIN",
        "Doctor Morton was a self-made man, but not a rough diamond,—rather one\nof Nature’s gentlemen. The pleasant urbanity of his manner was so\nconspicuous that no person of sensibility could approach him without\nbeing impressed by it. His was a character such as those who live by\nacademic rules would be more likely to misjudge than to comprehend.",
        "The semi-centennial of painless surgery was celebrated, in 1896, in\nBoston, New York, London, and other cities, and the credit of its\ndiscovery was universally awarded to William T. G. Morton. About the same\ntime it happened that the Massachusetts State House was reconstructed,\nand William Endicott, as Commissioner, and a near relative of Robert\nRantoul, had Morton’s name emblazoned in the Hall of Fame with those of\nFranklin, Morse, and Bell. This may be said to have decided the\ncontroversy; but, like many another benefactor of mankind, Doctor\nMorton’s reward on earth was a crown of thorns.",
        "February, 1869",
        "(Rewritten in 1897)",
        "As I look out of P——’s windows on the Via Frattina every morning at\nthe plaster bust of Pius IX., I like his face more and more, and feel\nthat he is not an unworthy companion to George Washington and the young\nAugustus. [Footnote: Three busts in a row.] I think there may be\nsomething of the fox, or rather of the crow, in his composition,\nbut his face has the wholeness of expression which shows a sound and\nhealthy mind,—not a patchwork character. I was pleased to hear that he\nwas originally a liberal; and the first, after the long conservative\nreaction of Metternich, to introduce reforms in the states of the Church.\nThe Revolution of 1848 followed too quickly, and the extravagant\nproceedings of Mazzini and Garibaldi drove him into the ranks of the\nconservatives, where he has remained ever since. Carlyle compared him to\na man who had an old tin-kettle which he thought he would mend, but as\nsoon as he began to tinker it the thing went to pieces in his hands. The\nRevolution of 1848 proved an unpractical experiment, but it opened the\nway for Victor Emanuel and a more sound liberalism in 1859.",
        "We attended service at the Sistine Chapel yesterday in company with two\nyoung ladies from Philadelphia, who wore long black veils so that Pius\nIX. might not catch the least glimpse of their pretty faces. I was\ndisappointed in my hope of obtaining a view of the Pope’s face. Cardinal\nBonaparte sat just in front of us, a man well worth observing. He looks\nto be the ablest living member of that family, and bears a decided\nresemblance to the old Napoleon. His features are strong, his eyes keen,\nand he wears his red cap in a jaunty manner on the side of his head. When\nthe blessing was passed around the conclave of Cardinals, Bonaparte\ntransferred it to his next neighbor as if he meant to put it through him.\nIt is supposed that he will be the successor of Pius IX.; but, as Rev.\nSamuel Longfellow says, that will depend very much upon whether Louis\nNapoleon is alive at the time of the election.",
        "The singing in the Sistine Chapel is not worth listening to, besides\nhaving unpleasant associations; so during the service we had an excellent\nopportunity to study Michael Angelo’s Last Judgment—for there was\nnothing else to be done.",
        "Kugler considers the picture an inharmonious composition, and that\nnothing could be more disagreeable than the stout figure of St.\nBartholomew holding a flaying knife in one hand and his own mortal hide\nin the other. This is not a pleasant spectacle; but Michael Angelo did\nnot paint for other people’s pleasure, but rather to satisfy his own\nconscience. It was customary to introduce St. Bartholomew in this manner,\nfor there was no other way in which he could be identified. We found the\ntowering form of St. Christopher on the left side of the Saviour rather\nmore of an eyesore than St. Bartholomew, whose expression of awe\npartially redeems his appearance.",
        "The Saviour has a herculean frame, but his face and head are magnificent.\nHe has no beard, and his hair is arranged in festoons which gives the\nimpression of a wreath of grape leaves. The expression of his face is the\nnoblest I have seen in any work of art in Rome; the face that has risen\nthrough suffering; calm, compassionate, immutable. The Madonna seems like\na girl beside this stalwart form, and she draws close to her son with\nnaive timidity at the vast concourse which crowds about them. Her face is\nexpressive of resignation and compassion rather than any joyful feeling.",
        "The left side of this vast painting, in which the bodies of men and women\nare rising from their graves, is less interesting than the right side,\nwhere the saints and blessed are gathered together above and the sinners\nare hurled down below. Michael Angelo’s saints and apostles look like\nvigorous men of affairs, and are all rather stout and muscular. The\nattitudes of some of them are by no means conventional, but they are\nnatural and unconstrained. St. Peter, holding forth the keys, is a\nmagnificent figure. The group of the saved who are congregated above the\nsaints is the pleasantest portion of the picture. Here Damion and Pythias\nembrace each other; a young husband springs to greet the wife whom he\nlost too early; a poor unfortunate to whom life was a curse is timidly\nraising his eyes, scarcely believing that he is in paradise; men with\nfine philosophic heads converse together; and a number of honest serving-\nwomen express their astonishment with such gestures as are customary\namong that class of persons.",
        "In the lunettes above, wingless angels are hovering with the cross, the\ncolumn, and other instruments of Christ’s agony, which they clasp with a\nloving devotion. In the lower right-hand corner, Charon appears (taken\nfrom pagan mythology) with a boat-load of sinners, whom he smites with\nhis oar according to Dante’s description. He is truly a terrible demon,\nand his fiery eyes gleam across the length of the chapel. Minos, who\nreceives the boat-load in the likeness of Biagio da Cesena, the pope’s\nmaster of ceremonies, is another to match him. A modern fop with banged\nhair is stepping from the boat to the shore of hell. This is said to be\nthe best painted portion of the picture,—most life-like and free from\nmannerism. It is a mighty work, and too little appreciated, like many\nother works of art, chiefly owing to the critics, who do not understand\nit, and write a lingo of their own which is not easy to make out and does\nnot come to much after all. [Footnote: All this shows what a heart there\nwas in Michael Angelo, and dissipates the assertion of a recent English\nbiographer that Michael Angelo painted masks instead of faces, with\nlittle or no expression.]",
        "After the service we went into St. Peter’s with the ladies, and walked\nthe whole circuit of the church. Our ladies talked meanwhile exactly as\nthey might at an American watering-place, without apparently observing\nanything about them. When we came to the statue of St. Peter, P—— said,\npointing to the big toe: “You see there the mischief that can be done by\ntoo much kissing.” Nearly a third of the toe has been worn away by the\noscular applications of the faithful.",
        "Feb. 4.—Dr. B. B. Appleton, an American resident of Florence, is\nhere on a flying visit. We have heard from many sources of the kindness\nof this man to American travellers, especially to young students. In\nfact, he took P—— into his house while at Florence, and entertained him\nin the most generous manner. He has done the same for Mrs. Julia Ward\nHowe and many others. He lives with an Italian family who were formerly\nin the service of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and who were ruined by the\nrecent change of rulers. Dr. Appleton boards with them, and helps to\nsupport them in other ways. In spite of his goodness he does not seem to\nbe happy.",
        "One of his chief friends in Florence is Fraulein Assig, who was banished\nfrom Prussia together with her publisher for editing Von Humboldt’s\nmemoirs, which were perhaps too severely critical of the late king of\nPrussia. The book, however, had an excellent sale, and she now lives\ncontentedly in Florence, where she is well acquainted both with prominent\nliberals and leading members of the government. Dr. Appleton reports that\na cabinet officer lately said to her, “We may move to Rome at any time.”",
        "Louis Napoleon is the main-stay of the papacy, and the only one it has.\nThe retrocession of Venetia to Italy has separated Austria effectually\nfrom the states of the Church, and the Spaniards are too much taken up\nwith their internal affairs to interfere at present in the pope’s behalf.\nNapoleon’s health is known to be delicate, and prayers for his\npreservation are offered up daily in Roman churches. If he should die\nbefore his son comes of age great political changes may be looked for.",
        "Meanwhile murmurs of discontent are heard on all sides. The city is\nunclean and badly cared for. The civil offices are said to be filled\nmainly with nephews of cardinals and other prelates. Even Italians\nof the lower classes know enough of political economy to foresee that if\nRome was the capital of Italy it would be more prosperous than it is at\npresent. The value of land would rise, and all the small trades would\nflourish. This is what is really undermining the power of Pius IX. A most\ncurious sign of the times is the general belief among the Roman populace\nthat the Pope has an evil eye. How long since this originated I have not\nbeen able to learn; but it is not uncommon for those who chance to see\nthe pope in his carriage, especially women, to go immediately into the\nnearest church for purification. A few days since the train from Rome to\nFlorence ran into a buffalo, and the locomotive was thrown off the track.\nEven this was attributed to the fact that the engineer had encountered\nthe pope near the Quirinal the previous Sunday.",
        "Dr. Appleton told us a story at dinner about the youth of Louis Napoleon.\nHis Florentine housekeeper, Gori, remembers Hortense and her two sons\nvery distinctly; for Louis once met him in the Boboli Gardens and\ninsisted on his smoking a cigar, in order to laugh at him when it had\nmade him sick,—as it was Gori’s first experience with tobacco. He also\nsays that on one occasion when the young princes had some sort of a feast\ntogether, the others all gave the caterer from five to ten francs as a\npour-boir, but Louis Napoleon gave him a twenty-franc piece. When\nhis companions expressed their surprise at this Louis said: “It is only\nright that I should do so, for some day I shall be Emperor.”",
        "As a rule few Italian men attend church. The women go; but the men, if\nnot heretical, are at least rather indifferent, on the subject of\nreligion. Macaulay refers to this fact in his essay on Macchiavelli, and\nDr. Appleton, who has lived among them, knows it to be true. To make\namends for it, English and American ladies are returning to the fold of\nSt. Peter in large numbers; and many of them bring their male relatives\neventually with them. I believe this to be largely a matter of fashion.\nThey have always accepted the Protestant creed as a matter of course, and\ncoming here, where they are separated from all previous associations,\nthey find themselves out of tune with their surroundings. They feel\nlonely, as all travellers do at times, and being in need of sympathy are\neasily impressed by those about them. Most of them have Catholic maids,\nwho often serve as stepping-stones to the acquaintance of the priest.\nConversion gives them a kind of importance, which Catholic ladies of rank\nknow how to make the most of. The external grandeur of Catholicism as we\nsee it here has also its due influence.",
        "Feb. 9.—I was greatly disgusted last evening while calling on two\nNew England ladies, who were formerly my schoolmates, to have a pompous\npriest walk in and take possession of the parlor, spoiling my pleasant\ntete-a-tete. He sat in the middle of the room like a pail of\nwater, and stared about in the most ill-mannered way. My friends remarked\nthat he was the abbate of the Pantheon, and he inquired if I had\nbeen to see it; to which I replied that I had, and that I considered it\nthe noblest building in Rome. This seemed to be a new idea to him, and\none which he did not altogether like. Not long since I came upon a priest\ndrinking wine with some young artists, and laughing at jokes for which a\nstage-driver might be ashamed. There are fine exceptions among them, but\nas a class they appear to me coarse and even vicious,—by no means\nspiritually attractive. Monks are not attractive either, but in their way\nthey are much more interesting. Religion seems to be meat and drink to\nthem.",
        "P—— and I were invited to dine by an American Catholic lady who was\nformerly a friend of Margaret Fuller, and who having been incautiously\nleft in Rome by her husband, embraced Catholicism before he was fairly\nacross the Atlantic,—to his lasting sorrow and vexation. Being in an\ninfluential position she has made many converts, and it is said that she\nhas come to Rome on the present occasion to be sainted by the pope. She\nhas already loaned P—— a biography of Father Lacordaire, which he has\nnot had leisure to read. He referred to it, as soon as politeness\npermitted, with a shrewd inquiry as to whether the book did not give\nrather a rose-colored view of practical Catholicism. Mrs. X—— turned to\nher daughters and said with all imaginable sweetness: “Just hear him,—\nthe poor child!” Then she went off into a long, eloquent, and really\ninteresting discourse on the true, sole, and original Christian Church.\nShe admitted, however, that during the sixteenth century the Christian\nfaith had much fallen into decay, and that Martin Luther was not to be\nblamed for his exhortations against the evil practices of popes and\ncardinals. Now that the Church had been reformed it was altogether\ndifferent. She told us how she became converted. It came to her like a\nvision on a gloomy winter day, while she was looking into the embers of a\nwood-fire.",
        "Then she talked about Margaret Fuller, whom she called the most brilliant\nwoman she had ever known. She had never loved another woman so much; but\nit was a dangerous love. If she wrote a rather gushing letter to\nMargaret, she would receive in reply, “How could you have written so\nbeautifully! You must have been inspired.” This, she said, had all the\neffect of flattery without being intended for it, and was so much the\nmore mischievous. “Emerson and Margaret Fuller,” said Mrs. X——, “put\ninspiration in the place of religion. They believed that some people had\ndirect communication with the Almighty.” P—— and I thought this might\nbe true of Miss Fuller, but doubted it in Emerson’s case.",
        "Miss X—— told me that she had lately ascended to the rotunda of the\nCapitol, from which the pope’s flag flies all day, and that she had asked\nthe Swiss guard what he would do if she hoisted the tricolor there. He\nreplied: “I should shoot you.” Nothing could be more kind or truly\ncourteous than the manner in which these ladies treated us.",
        "Another distinguished convert here is Mrs. Margaret Eveleth, a rare,\nspirituelle woman, who was born within a mile of my father’s house. She\nwas formerly a Unitarian, but soon became a Catholic on coming to Rome.\nWhile she was in process of transition from one church to the other she\nwrote a number of letters to her former pastor in New York, requesting\ninformation on points of faith. Not one of these letters was ever\nanswered, and it is incredible to suppose that they would not have been\nif he had received them. It is highly probable that they never left Rome.\nI have myself been warned to attach my stamps to letters firmly, so that\nthey may not be stolen in passing through the Post-office. Postage here\nis also double what it is in Florence.",
        "Feb. 12.—I have been looking for some time to find a good picture\nof Marcus Aurelius, and have generally become known among Roman\nphotographers as the man who wants the Marc Aureli. This morning I\nhad just left my room when I discovered Rev. Samuel Longfellow in a\nphotograph shop in the Via Frattina. “I was just coming to see you,” he\nsaid; “and I stopped here to look for a photograph of Marcus Aurelius.\"\nHe laughed when I told him that I had been on the same quest, and\nsuggested that we should walk to the Capitol together and look at the\nstatue and bust of our favorite emperor. “I think he was the greatest of\nthe Romans,” said Mr. Longfellow, “if not the noblest of all the\nancients.”",
        "So we walked together—as we never shall again—through the long Corso\nwith its array of palaces, past the column of Aurelius and the fragments\nof Trajan’s forum, until we reached the ancient Capitol of Rome,\nrearranged by Michael Angelo. Here we stood before the equestrian statue\nof Marcus Aurelius, and considered how it might be photographed to\nadvantage. “I do not think,” said Rev. Mr. Longfellow, “that we can\nobtain a satisfactory picture of it. The face is too dark to be\nexpressive, and it is the man’s face that I want; and I suppose you do\nalso.”",
        "I asked him how he could explain the creation of such a noble statue in\nthe last decline of Greek art; he said he would not attempt to explain it\nexcept on the ground that things do not always turn out as critics and\nhistorians would have them. It was natural that the arts should revive\nsomewhat under the patronage of Hadrian and the Antonines.",
        "We went into the museum of the Capitol to look for the bust of the young\nAurelius, which shone like a star (to use Homer’s expression) among its\nfellows, but we discovered from the earth-stains on portions of it why\nthe photographers had not succeeded better with it. We decided that our\nbest resource would be to have Mr. Appleton’s copy of it photographed,\nand Rev. Mr. Longfellow agreed to undertake the business with me in the\nforenoon of the next day.",
        "The busts of the Roman emperors were interesting because their characters\nare so strongly marked in history. The position would seem to have made\neither brutes or heroes of them. Tiberius, who was no doubt the natural\nson of Augustus, resembles him as a donkey does a horse. Caligula, Nero,\nand Domitian had small, feminine features; Nero a bullet-head and sensual\nlips, but the others quite refined. During the first six years of Nero’s\nreign he was not so bad as he afterwards became; and I saw an older bust\nof him in Paris which is too horrible to be looked at more than once.\nVespasian has a coarse face, but wonderfully good-humored; and Titus,\ncalled “the delight of mankind,” looks like an improvement on Augustus.\nThe youthful Commodus bears a decided resemblance to his father, and\nthere is no indication in his face to suggest the monster which he\nfinally became.",
        "Early in the next forenoon I reached the Hotel Costanzi in good season\nand inquired for the Rev. Mr. Longfellow. He soon appeared, together with\nMr. T. G. Appleton, who was evidently pleased at my interest in the young\nAurelius, and remarked that it was a more interesting work than the young\nAugustus. The bust had been sent to William Story’s studio to be cleaned,\nand thither we all proceeded in the best possible spirits.",
        "We found a photographer named Giovanni Braccia on the floor a\npiano above Mr. Story; and after a lengthy discussion with him, in\nwhich Mr. Longfellow was the leading figure, he agreed to take the\nphotographs at two napoleons a dozen. [Footnote: These pictures proved to\nbe fine reproductions, and are still to be met with in Boston and\nCambridge parlors.] When the bust was brought in Mr. Longfellow called my\nattention to the incisions representing pupils in the eyes, which he said\nwere a late introduction in sculpture, and not generally considered an\nimprovement. After this Mr. Appleton called to us to come with him to the\nstudio of an English painter in the same building, whose name I cannot\nnow recollect. He was the type of a graceful, animated young artist, and\nhad just finished a painting representing ancient youths and maidens in a\nprocession with the light coming from the further side, so that their\nfaces were mostly in shadow, with bright line along the profile,—an\neffect which it requires skill to render.",
        "On returning to the street we looked into Mr. Story’s outer room again,\nwhere the casts of all his statues were seated in a double row like\npersons at a theatre. Mr. Appleton was rather severe in his criticism of\nthem, though he admitted that the Cleopatra (which I believe was a\nreplica) had a finely modulated face.",
        "Feb. 15.—Warrington Wood invited P—— and myself to lunch with\nhim in his studio, and at the appointed time a waiter appeared from the\nLapre with a great tin box on his shoulder filled with spaghetti,\nroast goat, and other Italian dishes. We had just spread these on a table\nin front of the clay model of Michael and Satan, when Wood’s marble-\ncutter rushed in to announce the King and Queen of Naples. Wood hastily\nthrew a green curtain over the dishes, while P—— and I retreated to the\nfurther end of the room.",
        "The Queen of Naples is a fine-looking and spirited person, still quite\nyoung, and talks English well. She conversed with Wood and asked him a\nnumber of questions about his group, and also about the stag-hound, Eric,\nthat was standing sentinel. The King said almost nothing, and moving\nabout as if he know not what to do with himself, finally backed up\nagainst the table where our lunch was covered by the green cloth. I think\nhe had an idea of sitting down on it, but the dishes set up such a\nclatter that he beat a hasty retreat. The King did not move a muscle of\nhis countenance, but the Queen looked around and said something to him in\nItalian, laughing pleasantly. She is said to be friendly to Americans and\nis quite intimate with Miss Harriet Hosmer. She is at least a woman of\nnoble courage, and when Garibaldi besieged Naples she went on to the\nramparts and rallied the soldiers with the shells bursting about her.",
        "They subscribed themselves in Wood’s register under the name of Bourbon,\nand after their departure we found our lunch cold, but perhaps we\nrelished it better for this visitation of royalty. Then we all went to\nthe carnival, where an Italian lazzaroni attempted to pick Wood’s\npocket, but was caught in the act and soundly kicked by Wood.",
        "This was the most entertaining event of the afternoon. The best part of\nthe carnival was the quantity of fresh flowers that were brought in from\nthe country and sold at very moderate prices. P—— distinguished himself\nthrowing bouquets to ladies in the balconies. It is said that he has an\nadmirer among them. For the first hour or so I found it entertaining\nenough, but after that I became weary of its endless repetition. Eighty\nyears since Goethe, seated in one of these balconies, was obliged to ask\nfor paper and pencil to drive away ennui, as he afterwards\nconfessed. The carnival now is almost entirely given up to the English\nand Americans; while many of the lower class of Italians mix in it\ndisguised in masks and fancy dresses. Four masked young women greeted us\nwith confetti and danced about me on the sidewalk. One tipped up my hat\nbehind and another whispered a name in my ear which I did not suppose was\nknown in Europe. I have not yet discovered who they were.",
        "Feb. 19.—I have had the pleasure of dining with that remarkable\nwoman and once distinguished actress, Miss Charlotte Cushman. Her nephew\nwas consul at Rome, appointed by William II. Seward, who was one of her\nwarmest American friends. She is still queen of the stage, and of her own\nhousehold, and unconsciously gives orders to the servants in a dramatic\nmanner which is sometimes very amusing. So it was to hear her sing,\n\"Mary, call the cattle home,” as if she were sending for the heavy\nartillery. She impresses me, however, as one of the most genuine of\nwomankind; and her conversation is delightful,—so sympathetic,\nappreciative, full of strong good sense, and fresh original views. She\nhas small mercy on newly-converted Catholics. “The faults of men,” she\nsaid, “are chiefly those of strength, but the faults of my own sex arise\nfrom weakness.” I happened to refer to Mr. Appleton’s bust of Aurelius,\nand she said she was surprised he had purchased it, for it did not seem\nto her a satisfactory copy; a conclusion that I had been slowly coming to\nmyself. She has a bronze replica of Story’s “Beethoven” which, like most\nof his statues, is seated in a chair, and a rather realistic work, as\nMiss Cushman admitted. I judged from the conversation at table that she\nis not treated with full respect by the English and American society\nhere, although looked upon as a distinguished person. The reason for this\nmay be more owing to the social position of her relatives than her former\nprofession. Mrs. Trelawney, the wife of Byron’s eccentric friend, spoke\nof her to me a few days ago in terms of the highest esteem. She is a\ngreat-hearted woman, and her presence would be a moral power anywhere.",
        "There is snobbishness enough in Rome—English, American, and Italian.\nDoolittle, who is the son of a highly respectable New York lawyer, went\nto the hunt last week, as he openly confessed, to give himself\ndistinction. A young lady was thrown from her horse, and he was the first\nperson to come to her assistance. She thanked him for it at the time, but\ntwo days afterwards declined to recognize his acquaintance. This was\nprobably because he was an artist, or rather sets up for one, for he is\nmore like a gentleman of leisure.",
        "The Longfellow party will soon depart for Naples, and I went to the\nCostanzi to make my final call. Mr. Henry W. Longfellow was alone in his\nparlor cutting the leaves of a large book. He said that his brother had\ngone to the Pincion with the ladies, but would probably return soon.\nEverything this man says and does has the same grace and elevated tone as\nhis poetry. I took a chair and pretty soon he said to me, “How do you\nlike your books, Mr. S——? For my part, I prefer to cut the leaves of a\nbook, for then I feel as if I had earned the right to read it.” I replied\nthat I liked books with rough edges if they were printed on good paper;\nand then he said, “See this remarkable picture.”",
        "I drew my chair closer to him, and he showed me a large colored chart of\nHell and Purgatory, according to the theory that prevailed in Dante’s\ntime. Satan with his three faces was represented in the centre, and on\nthe other side rose the Mount of Purgatory.",
        "“It is an Italian commentary,” he said, “on the Divina Commedia,\"\nwhich had been sent to him that day; and he added that some of the\ninformation in it was of a very curious sort.",
        "I asked him if he could read Italian as easily as English. “Very nearly,\"\nhe replied; “but the fine points of Italian are as difficult as those of\nGerman.”",
        "He inquired how I and my friends spent our evenings in Rome, and I said,\n\"In all kinds of study and reading, but just now P—— was at work on\nBrowning’s ’Ring and the Book.’”",
        "Mr. Longfellow laughed. “I do not wonder you call it work,” he said. “It\nseems to me a story told in so many different ways may be something of a\ncuriosity—not much of a poem.” [Footnote: I have since observed that\npoets as a class are not fair critics of poetry; for they are sure to\nprefer poetry which is like their own. This is true at least of Lowell,\nEmerson, or Matthew Arnold; but when I came to read “The Ring and the\nBook” I found that Longfellow’s objection was a valid one.]",
        "I remarked that Rev. Mr. Longfellow had a decided partiality for\nBrowning. “Yes,” he said; “Sam likes him, and my friend John Weiss\nprefers him to Tennyson. My objection is to his diction. I have always\nfound the English language sufficient for my purpose, and have never\ntried to improve on it. Browning’s ’Saul’ and ’The Ride from Ghent to\nAix’ are noble poems.”",
        "“Carlyle also,” I said, “has a peculiar diction.” “That is true,” he\nreplied, “but one can forgive anything to a writer who has so much to\ntell us as Carlyle. Besides, he writes prose, and not poetry.”",
        "He took up a photograph which was lying on the table and showed it to me,\nsaying, “How do you like Miss Stebbins’s ’Satan’?” I told him I hardly\nknew how to judge of such a subject. Then we both laughed, and Mr.\nLongfellow said: “I wonder what our artists want to make Satans for. I\ndoubt if there is one of them that believes in the devil’s existence.”",
        "I noticed on closer examination that the features resembled those of Miss\nStebbins herself. Mr. Longfellow looked at it closely, and said, “So it\ndoes,—somewhat.” Then I told him that I asked Warrington Wood how he\nobtained the expression for his head of Satan, and that he said he did it\nby looking in the glass and making up faces. Mr. Longfellow laughed\nheartily at this, saying, “I suppose Miss Stebbins did the same, and that\nis how it came about. Our sculptors should be careful how they put\nthemselves in the devil’s place. Wood has modelled a fine angel, and his\ngroup (Michael and Satan) is altogether an effective one.”",
        "Rev. Mr. Longfellow and the ladies now came in, and as it was late I\nshook hands with them all.",
        "It is reported that when Mr. Longfellow met Cardinal Antonelli he\nremarked that Rome had changed less in the last fifteen years than other\nlarge cities, and that Antonelli replied, “Yes; God be praised for it!”",
        "Feb. 25.—The elder Herbert [Footnote: The elder of two brothers,\nsons of an English artist.] has painted a fine picture, and we all went\nto look at it this afternoon, as it will be packed up to-morrow for the\nRoyal Exhibition at London. He has chosen for his subject the verse of a\nGreek poet, otherwise unknown:",
        "Herbert has substituted buffalos for oxen as being more picturesque,\nthough they were not imported into Italy until some time in the Middle\nAges. It is generally predicted that Herbert will become an R. A. like\nhis father; but the subject is even more to his credit than his treatment\nof it. It is discussed at the Lapre whether this verse has been\nequalled by Tennyson or Longfellow, and the conclusion was: “Not proven.”",
        "March 1.—The Longfellows are gone, and Rome is filling up with a\ndifferent class of people who have come here to witness the fatiguing\nspectacles of Easter. One look at Michael Angelo’s “Last Judgment” would\nbe worth the whole of it to me.",

        "A hundred years ago A. Bronson Alcott was born, and thirty-three years\nlater his daughter Louisa was born, happily on the same day of the year,\nas if for this very purpose,—that you might testify your appreciation of\nthe good work they did in this world, at one and the same moment. It was\na fortunate coincidence, which we like to think of to-day, as it\nundoubtedly gave pleasure to Bronson Alcott and his wife sixty-seven\nyears ago.",
        "How genuine were Mr. Alcott and his daughter, Louisa! “All else,” says\nthe sage, “is superficial and perishable, save love and truth only.” It\nis through the love and truth that was in these two that we still feel\ntheir influence as if they were living to-day. How well I recollect Mr.\nAlcott’s first visit to my father’s house at Medford, when I was a boy! I\nhad the same impression of him then that the consideration of his life\nmakes on me now,—as an exceptional person, but one greatly to be\ntrusted. I could see that he was a man who wished well to me, and to all\nmankind; who had no intention of encroaching on my rights as an\nindividual in any way whatever; and who, furthermore, had no suspicion of\nme as a person alien to himself. The criticism made of him by my young\nbrother held good of him then and always,—that “he looked like one of\nChrist’s disciples.” His aspect was intelligently mild and gentle,\nunmixed with the slightest taint of worldly self-interest.",
        "He heard that Goethe had said, “We begin to sin as soon as we act;” but\nhe did not agree to this, and was determined that one man at least should\nlive in this world without sinning. He carried this plan out so\nconsistently that, as he once confessed to me, it brought him to the\nverge of starvation. Then he realized that in order to play our part in\nthe general order of things,—in order to obviate the perpetual tendency\nin human affairs to chaos,—we are continually obliged to compromise.\nHowever, to the last he would never touch animal food. Others might\nmurder sheep and oxen, but he, Bronson Alcott, would not be a partaker in\nwhat he considered a serious transgression of moral law. This brought him\ninto antagonism with the current of modern opinion, which considers man\nthe natural ruler of this earth, and that it is both his right and his\nduty to remodel it according to his ideas of usefulness and beauty.",
        "It brought him into a life-long conflict with society, but how gallantly,\nhow amiably he carried this on you all know. It cannot be said that he\nwas defeated, for his spirit was unconquerable. His purity of intention\nalways received its true recognition; and wherever Bronson Alcott went he\ncollected the most earnest, high-minded people about him, and made them\nmore earnest, more high-minded by his conversation.",
        "How different was his daughter, Louisa,—the keen observer of life and\nmanners; the witty story-teller with the pictorial mind; always\nsympathetic, practical, helpful—the mainstay of her family, a pillar of\nsupport to her friends; forgetting the care of her own soul in her\ninterest for the general welfare; heedless of her own advantage, and\nthereby obtaining for herself as a gift from heaven, the highest of all\nadvantages, and the greatest of all rewards!",
        "And yet, with so wide a difference in the practical application of their\nlives, the well-spring of Louisa’s thought and the main-spring of her\naction were identical with those of her father, and may be considered an\ninheritance from him. For the well-spring of her thought was\ntruth, and the main-spring of her action was love. There\ncan be no fine art, no great art, no art which is of service to mankind,\nwhich does not originate on this twofold basis. We are told that when she\nwas a young girl, on a voyage from Philadelphia to Boston, her face\nsuddenly lighted up with the true brightness of genius, as she said, “I\nlove everybody in this whole world!” If, afterwards, a vein of satire\ncame to be mingled with this genial flow of human kindness, it was not\nLouisa’s fault.",
        "In like manner, Bronson Alcott rested his argument for immortality on the\nground of the family affections. “Such strong ties,” he reasoned, “could\nnot have been made merely to be broken.” Let us share his faith, and\nbelieve that they have not been broken.",

        "On his first visit to England, Emerson was so continually besieged with\ninvitations that, as he wrote to Carlyle, answering the notes he received\n\"ate up his day like a cherry;” and yet I have never met but one\nEnglishman, Dr. John Tyndall, the chemist, who seemed to appreciate\nEmerson’s poetry, and few others who might be said to appreciate the man\nhimself. Tyndall may have recognized Emerson’s keen insight for the\npoetry of science in such verses as:",
        "A person who lacks some knowledge of geology would not be likely to\nunderstand this. Matthew Arnold and Edwin Arnold had no very high opinion\nof Emerson’s poetry; and even Carlyle, who was Emerson’s best friend in\nEurope, spoke of it in rather a disparaging manner. The “Mountain and the\nSquirrel” and several others have been translated into German, but not\nthose which we here consider the best of them.",
        "On the other hand, Dr. William H. Furness considered Emerson “heaven-high\nabove our other poets;” C. P. Cranch preferred him to Longfellow; Dr. F.\nH. Hedge looked upon him as the first poet of his time; Rev. Samuel\nLongfellow and Rev. Samuel Johnson held a very similar opinion, and David\nA. Wasson considered Emerson’s “Problem” one of the great poems of the\ncentury.",
        "These men were all poets themselves, though they did not make a\nprofession of it, and in that character were quite equal to Matthew\nArnold, whose lecture on Emerson was evidently written under unfavorable\ninfluences. They were men who had passed through similar experiences to\nthose which developed Emerson’s mind and character, and could therefore\ncomprehend him better than others. We all feel that Emerson’s poetry is\nsometimes too abstruse, especially in his earlier verses, and that its\nmeaning is often too recondite for ready apprehension; but there are\npassages in it so luminous and so far-reaching in their application that\nonly the supreme poets of all time have equalled them.",
        "Homer’s strength consists in his pictorial descriptions, but also\nsometimes in pithy reflections on life and human nature; and it is in\nthese latter that Emerson often comes close to him. Most widely known of\nHomer’s epigrams is that reply of Telemachus to Antiochus in the Odyssey,\nwhich Pope has rendered:",

        "The wise man carries rest and contentment in his own mental life, and is\nequally himself at the Corona d’Italia and on a western ranch; while the\nweakling runs back to earlier associations like a colt to its stable. But\nHomer is also Emersonian at times. What could be more so than Achilles’s\nmemorable saying, which is repeated by Ulysses in the Odyssey: “More\nhateful to me than the gates of death is he who thinks one thing and\nspeaks another;” or this exclamation of old Laertes in the last book of\nthe Odyssey: “What a day is this when I see my son and grandson\ncontending in excellence!”",
        "It seems a long way from Dante to Emerson, and yet there are Dantean\npassages in “Woodnotes” and “Voluntaries.” They are not in Dante’s\nmatchless measure, but they have much of his grace, and more of his\ninflexible will. This warning against mercenary marriages might be\ncompared to Dante’s answer to the embezzling Pope Nicholas III. in Canto\nXIX. of the Inferno:",
        "There is a Spartan-like severity in this, but so was Dante very severe.\nIt was his mission to purify the moral sense of his countrymen in an age\nwhen the Church no longer encouraged virtue; and Emerson no less\nvigorously opposed the rank materialism of America in a period of\nexceptional prosperity.",
        "The next succeeding lines are not exactly Dantean, but they are among\nEmerson’s finest, and worthy of any great poet. The “Pine Tree” says:",
        "Again we are reminded of Dante in the opening passages of “Voluntaries”:",
        "It is still more difficult to compare Emerson with Shakespeare, for the\none was Puritan with a strong classic tendency, and the other anti-\nPuritan with a strong romantic tendency; but allowing for this and for\nShakespeare’s universality, it may be affirmed that there are few\npassages in King Henry IV. and Henry V. which take a higher rank than\nEmerson’s description of Cromwell:",
        "Emerson learned a large proportion of his wisdom from Goethe, as he\nfrequently confessed, but where in Goethe’s poetry will you find a\nquatrain of more penetrating beauty or wider significance than this from\n\"Woodnotes”:",
        "Or this one from the “Building of the House\"—considered metaphorically\nas the life structure of man:",
        "There is a flash as of heaven’s own lightning in some of his verses, and\nhis name has become a spell to conjure with.",
        "When the “Marble Faun” was first published the art criticism in it,\nespecially of sculptors and painters who were then living, created a deal\nof discussion, which has been revived again by the recent centennial\ncelebration. Hawthorne himself was the most perfect artist of his time as\na man of letters, and the judgment of such a person ought to have its\nvalue, even when it relates to subjects which are beyond the customary\nsphere of his investigations, and for which he has not made a serious\npreparation. In spite of the adage, “every man to his own trade,” it may\nbe fairly asserted that much of Hawthorne’s art criticism takes rank\namong the finest that has been written in any language. On the other\nhand, there are instances, as might be expected, in which he has failed\nto hit the mark.",
        "These latter may be placed in two classes: Firstly, those in which he\nindicates a partiality for personal acquaintances; and secondly, those in\nwhich he has followed popular opinion at the time, or the opinion of\nothers, without sufficient consideration.",
        "American society in Rome is always split up into various cliques,—which\nis not surprising in view of the adventitious manner in which it comes\ntogether there,—and in Hawthorne’s time the two leading parties were the\nStory and the Crawford factions. The latter was a man of true genius, and\nnot only the best of American sculptors, but perhaps the greatest\nsculptor of the nineteenth century. His statue of Beethoven is in the\ngrand manner, and instinct with harmony, not only in attitude and\nexpression, but even to the arrangement of the drapery. Crawford’s genius\nwas only too well appreciated, and he was constantly carrying off the\nprizes of his art from all competitors. Consequently it was inevitable\nthat other sculptors should be jealous of him, and should unite together\nfor mutual protection. Story was a man of talent, and not a little of an\namateur, but he was the gentlemanly entertainer of those Americans who\ncame to the city with good letters of introduction. Hawthorne evidently\nfell into Story’s hands. He speaks slightingly of Crawford, and praises\nStory’s statue of Cleopatra in unqualified terms; and yet there seems to\nhave been an undercurrent of suspicion in his mind, for he says more than\nonce in the “Marble Faun” that it would appear to be a failing with\nsculptors to speak unfavorably of the work of other sculptors, and this,\nof course, refers to those with whom he was acquainted, and whom he\nsometimes rated above their value.",
        "Warrington Wood, the best English sculptor of thirty years ago, praised\nStory’s “Cleopatra” to me, and I believe that Crawford also would have\npraised it. Neither has Hawthorne valued its expression too highly—the\nexpression of worldly splendor incarnated in a beautiful woman on the\ntragical verge of an abyss. If she only were beautiful! Here the\nlimitations of the statue commence. Hawthorne says: “The sculptor had not\nshunned to give the full, Nubian lips, and other characteristics of the\nEgyptian physiognomy.” Here he follows the sculptor himself, and it is\nremarkable that a college graduate like William Story should have made so\ntransparent a mistake. Cleopatra was not an Egyptian at all. The\nPtolemies were Greeks, and it is simply impossible to believe that they\nwould have allied themselves with a subject and alien race. This kind of\nsmall pedantry has often led artists astray, and was peculiarly virulent\nduring the middle of the last century. The whole figure of Story’s\n\"Cleopatra” suffers from it. He says again: “She was draped from head to\nfoot in a costume minutely and scrupulously studied from that of ancient\nEgypt.” In fact, the body and limbs of the statue are so closely shrouded\nas to deprive the work of that sense of freedom of action and royal\nabandon which greets us in Shakespeare’s and Plutarch’s “Cleopatra.\"\nStory might have taken a lesson from Titian’s matchless “Cleopatra\"\nin the Cassel Gallery, or from Marc Antonio’s small woodcut of\nRaphael’s “Cleopatra.”",
        "Hawthorne was an idealist, and he idealized the materials in Story’s\nstudio, for literary purposes, just as Shakespeare idealized Henry V.,\nwho was not a magnanimous monarch at all, but a brutal, narrow-minded\nfighter. The discourse on art, which he develops in this manner, forms\none of the most valuable chapters in the “Marble Faun.” It assists us in\nreading it to remember that Story was not the model for Hawthorne’s\n\"Kenyon,” but a very different character. The passage in which he\ncriticises the methods of modern sculptors has often been quoted in later\nwritings on that subject; and I suppose the whole brotherhood of artists\nwould rise up against me if I were to support Hawthorne’s condemnation of\nnude Venuses and “the guilty glimpses stolen at hired models.”",
        "They are not necessarily guilty glimpses. To an experienced artist the\ncustomary study from a naked figure, male or female, is little more than\nwhat a low-necked dress would be to others. Yet the instinct of the age\nshrinks from this exposure. We can make pretty good Venuses, but we\ncannot look at them through the same mental and moral atmosphere as the\ncotemporaries of Scopas, or even with the same eyes that Michael Angelo\ndid. We feel the difference between a modern Venus and an ancient one.\nThere is a statue in the Vatican of a Roman emperor, of which every one\nsays that it ought to wear clothes; and the reason is because the face\nhas such a modern look. A raving Bacchante may be a good acquisition to\nan art museum, but it is out of place in a public library. A female\nstatue requires more or less drapery to set off the outlines of the\nfigure and to give it dignity. We feel this even in the finest Greek\nwork—like the Venus of Cnidos.",
        "In this matter Hawthorne certainly exposes his Puritanic education, and\nhe also places too high a value on the carving of buttonholes and\nshoestrings by Italian workmen. Such things are the fag-ends of statuary.",
        "His judgment, however, is clear and convincing in regard to the tinted\nEves and Venuses of Gibson. Whatever may have been the ancient practice\nin this respect, Gibson’s experiment proved a failure. Nobody likes those\nstatues; and no other sculptor has since followed Gibson’s example.",
        "Hawthorne overestimates the Apollo Belvidere, as all the world did at\nthat time; but his single remark concerning Canova is full of\nsignificance: “In these precincts which Canova’s genius was not quite of\na character to render sacred, though it certainly made them interesting,\"\netc.",
        "He goes to the statue gallery in the Vatican and returns with a feeling\nof dissatisfaction, and justly so, for the vast majority of statues there\nare merely copies, and many of them very bad copies. He recognizes the\nLaocoon for what it really is, the abstract type of a Greek tragedy. He\nnotices what has since been proved by severe archaeological study, that\nmost of the possible types and attitudes of marble statues had been\nexhausted by the Greeks long before the Christian era. Miss Hosmer’s\nZenobia was originally a Ceres, and even Crawford’s Orpheus strongly\nresembles a figure in the Niobe group at Florence.",
        "But Hawthorne’s description of the Faun of Praxiteles stands by itself.\nAs a penetrative analysis of a great sculptor’s motive it is unequalled\nby any modern writer on art, and this is set forth with a grace and\ndelicacy worthy of Praxiteles himself. The only criticism which one feels\ninclined to make of it is that it too Hawthornish, too modern and\nelaborate; but is not this equally true of all modern criticism? We\ncannot return to the simplicity of the Greeks any more than we can to\ntheir customs. If Hawthorne would seem to discover too much in this\nstatue, which is really a poor Roman copy, he has himself given us an\nanswer to this objection. In Volume II., Chapter XII., he says: “Let the\ncanvas glow as it may, you must look with the eye of faith, or its\nhighest excellence escapes you. There is always the necessity of helping\nout the painter’s art with your own resources of sensibility and\nimagination.” His cursory remarks on Raphael are not less pertinent and\npenetrating. Of technicalities he knew little, but no one, perhaps, has\nsounded such depths of that clairvoyant master’s nature, and so brought\nto light the very soul of him.",
        "The “Marble Faun” may not be the most perfect of Hawthorne’s works, but\nit is much the greatest,—an epic romance, which can only be compared\nwith Goethe’s “Wilhelm Meister.”",
        "To compare a person in real life with a character in fiction is not\nuncommon, but it is more conducive to solidity of judgment to compare the\nliving with the living, and the imaginary with the imaginary. The chief\ndifficulty, however, in Hamlet’s case, is that he only appears before us\nas a person acting in an abnormal mental condition. The mysterious death\nof his father, the suspicion of his mother’s complicity in crime, which\ntakes the form of an apparition from beyond the grave, is too much of a\nstrain for his tender and impressible nature. His mental condition has\nbecome well known to physicians as cerebral hyperaemia, and all\nhis strange speeches and eccentric actions are to be traced to this\nsource; and it is for this reason that the dispute has arisen as to\nwhether Hamlet was not partially insane. If the strain continued long\nenough he would no doubt have become insane.",
        "As well as we can penetrate through this adventitious nimbus, we\ndiscover Hamlet to be a person of generous, princely nature, high-minded\nand chivalrous. He is cordial to every one, but always succeeds in\nasserting the superiority of his position, even in his conversation with\nHoratio. If he is mentally sensitive he shows no indication of it. He\nnever appears shy or reserved, but on the contrary, confident and even\nbold. This may be owing to the mental excitement under which he labors;\nbut the best critics from Goethe down have accredited him with a lack of\nresolution; and it is this which produces the catastrophe of the play. He\nmust have realized, as we all do, that after the scene of the players in\nwhich he “catches the conscience of a king,” his life was in great\ndanger. He should either have organized a conspiracy at once, or fled to\nthe court of Fortinbras; but he allows events to take their course, and\nis controlled by them instead of shaping his own destiny. Instead of\nplanning and acting he philosophizes.",
        "Of Hawthorne, on the contrary, we know nothing except as a person in a\nperfectly normal condition. His wife once said that she had rarely known\nhim to be indignant, and never to lose his temper. He was the most\nsensitive of men, but he also possessed an indomitable will. It was only\nhis terrible determination that could make his life a success. Emerson,\nwho had little sympathy with him otherwise, always admired the perfect\nequipoise of his nature. A man could not be more thoroughly himself; but,\nsuch a reticent, unsociable character as Hawthorne could never be used as\nthe main-spring of a drama, for he would continually impede the progress\nof the plot. A dramatic character needs to be a talkative person; one\nthat either acts out his internal life, or indirectly exposes it.\nHawthorne’s best friends do not appear to have known what his real\nopinions were. This perpetual reserve, this unwillingness to assimilate\nhimself to others, may have been necessary for the perfection of his art.",
        "The greater a writer or an artist, the more unique he is,—the more\nsharply defined from all other members of his class. Hawthorne certainly\ndid not resemble Scott, Dickens, or Thackeray, either in his life or his\nwork. He was perhaps more like Auerbach than any other writer of the\nnineteenth century, but still more like Goldsmith. The “Vicar of\nWakefield” and the “House of the Seven Gables” are the two perfect\nromances in the English tongue; and the “Deserted Village,” though\nwritten in poetry, has very much the quality of Hawthorne’s shorter\nsketches. “And tales much older than the ale went round” is closely akin\nto Hawthorne’s humor; yet there was little outward similarity between\nthem, for Goldsmith was often gay and sometimes frivolous; and although\nHawthorne never published a line of poetry he was the more poetic of the\ntwo, as Goldsmith was the more dramatic. He also resembled Goldsmith in\nhis small financial difficulties.",
        "In his persistent reserve, in the seriousness of his delineation, and in\nhis indifference to the opinions of others, Hawthorne reminds us somewhat\nof Michael Angelo; but he is one of the most unique figures among the\nworld’s geniuses.",
