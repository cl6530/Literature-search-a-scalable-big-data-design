        "And precisely this angry aspect of the waters has been acclaimed as one\nof the origins of that river-dragon idea which used to be common in\nsouth Italy, before the blight of Spaniardism fell upon the land and\nwithered up the pagan myth-making faculty. There are streams still\nperpetuating this name–the rivulet Dragone, for instance, which falls\ninto the Ionian not far from Cape Colonne.",
        "A non-angry aspect of them has also been suggested as the origin: the\ntortuous wanderings of rivers in the plains, like the Meander, that\nrecall the convolutions of the serpent. For serpent and dragon are apt\nto be synonymous with the ancients.",
        "Both these explanations, I think, are late developments in the evolution\nof the dragon-image. They leave one still puzzling as to what may be the\naboriginal conception underlying this legendary beast of earth and\nclouds and waters. We must go further back.",
        "What is a dragon? An animal, one might say, which looks or regards\n(Greek drakon); so called, presumably, from its terrible eyes. Homer\nhas passages which bear out this interpretation:",
        "[Greek: Smerdaleon de dedorken], etc.",
        "Now the Greeks were certainly sensitive to the expression of animal\neyes–witness “cow-eyed” Hera, or the opprobrious epithet “dog-eyed\";\naltogether, the more we study what is left of their zoological\nresearches, the more we realize what close observers they were in\nnatural history. Aristotle, for instance, points out sexual differences\nin the feet of the crawfish which were overlooked up to a short time\nago. And Hesiod also insists upon the dragon’s eyes. Yet it is\nsignificant that ophis, the snake, is derived, like drakon, from a\nroot meaning nothing more than to perceive or regard. There is no\nconnotation of ferocity in either of the words. Gesner long ago suspected\nthat the dragon was so called simply from its keen or rapid perception.",
        "One likes to search for some existing animal prototype of a fabled\ncreature like this, seeing that to invent such things out of sheer\nnothing is a feat beyond human ingenuity–or, at least, beyond what the\nhistory of others of their kind leads us to expect. It may well be that\nthe Homeric writer was acquainted with the Uromastix lizard that occurs\nin Asia Minor, and whoever has watched this beast, as I have done,\ncannot fail to have been impressed by its contemplative gestures, as if\nit were gazing intently (drakon) at something. It is, moreover, a\n“dweller in rocky places,” and more than this, a vegetarian–an “eater\nof poisonous herbs” as Homer somewhere calls his dragon. So Aristotle\nsays: “When the dragon has eaten much fruit, he seeks the juice of the\nbitter lettuce; he has been seen to do this.”",
        "Are we tracking the dragon to his lair? Is this the aboriginal beast?\nNot at all, I should say. On the contrary, this is a mere side-issue, to\nfollow which would lead us astray. The reptile-dragon was invented when\nmen had begun to forget what the arch-dragon was; it is the product of a\nlater stage–the materializing stage; that stage when humanity sought to\nexplain, in naturalistic fashion, the obscure traditions of the past. We\nmust delve still deeper. . . .",
        "My own dragon theory is far-fetched–perhaps necessarily so, dragons\nbeing somewhat remote animals. The dragon, I hold, is the\npersonification of the life within the earth–of that life which, being\nunknown and uncontrollable, is eo ipso hostile to man. Let me explain\nhow this point is reached.",
        "The animal which looks or regards. . . . Why–why an animal? Why not\ndrakon = that which looks?",
        "Now, what looks?",
        "The eye.",
        "This is the key to the understanding of the problem, the key to the\nsubterranean dragon-world.",
        "The conceit of fountains or sources of water being things that see\n(drakon)–that is, eyes–or bearing some resemblance to eyes, is common\nto many races. In Italy, for example, two springs in the inland sea near\nTaranto are called “Occhi\"–eyes; Arabs speak of a watery fountain as an\neye; the notion exists in England top–in the “Blentarn” of Cumberland,\nthe blind tarn (tarn = a trickling of tears), which is “blind” because\ndry and waterless, and therefore lacking the bright lustre of the open eye.",
        "There is an eye, then, in the fountain: an eye which looks or regards.\nAnd inasmuch as an eye presupposes a head, and a head without body is\nhard to conceive, a material existence was presently imputed to that\nwhich looked upwards out of the liquid depths. This, I think, is the\nprimordial dragon, the archetype. He is of animistic descent and\nsurvives all over the earth; and it is precisely this universality of\nthe dragon-idea which induces me to discard all theories of local origin\nand to seek for some common cause. Fountains are ubiquitous, and so are\ndragons. There are fountain dragons in Japan, in the superstitions of\nKeltic races, in the Mediterranean basin. The dragon of Wantley lived in\na well; the Lambton Worm began life in fresh water, and only took to\ndry land later on. I have elsewhere spoken of the Manfredonia legend of\nSaint Lorenzo and the dragon, an indigenous fable connected, I suspect,\nwith the fountain near the harbour of that town, and quite independent\nof the newly-imported legend of Saint Michael. Various springs in Greece\nand Italy are called Dragoneria; there is a cave-fountain Dragonara on\nMalta, and another of the same name near Cape Misenum–all are sources\nof apposite lore. The water-drac. . . .",
        "So the dragon has grown into a subterranean monster, who peers up from\nhis dark abode wherever he can–out of fountains or caverns whence\nfountains issue. It stands to reason that he is sleepless; all dragons\nare “sleepless “; their eyes are eternally open, for the luminous\nsparkle of living waters never waxes dim. And bold adventurers may well\nbe devoured by dragons when they fall into these watery rents, never to\nappear again.",
        "Furthermore, since gold and other treasures dear to mankind lie hidden\nin the stony bowels of the earth and are hard to attain, the jealous\ndragon has been accredited with their guardianship–hence the plutonic\nelement in his nature. The dragon, whose “ever-open eye” protected the\ngarden of the Hesperides, was the Son of Earth. The earth or\ncave-dragon. . . . Calabria has some of these dragons’ caves; you can\nread about them in the Campania. Sotteranea of G. Sanchez.",
        "In volcanic regions there are fissures in the rocks exhaling pestiferous\nemanations; these are the spiracula, the breathing-holes, of the\ndragon within. The dragon legends of Naples and Mondragone are probably\nof this origin, and so is that of the Roman Campagna (1660) where the\ndragon-killer died from the effects of this poisonous breath: Sometimes\nthe confined monster issues in a destructive lava-torrent–Bellerophon\nand the Chimsera. The fire-dragon. ... Or floods of water suddenly\nstream down from the hills and fountains are released. It is the hungry\ndragon, rushing from his den in search of prey; the river-dragon. . . .\nHe rages among the mountains with such swiftness and impetuosity.",
        "This is chiefly the poets’ work, though the theologians have added one\nor two embellishing touches. But in whatever shape he appears, whether\nhis eyes have borrowed a more baleful fire from heathen basilisks, or\ntraits of moral evil are instilled into his pernicious physique by\namalgamation with the apocalyptic Beast, he remains the vindictive enemy\nof man and his ordered ways. Of late–like the Saurian tribe in\ngeneral–he has somewhat degenerated. So in modern Greece, by that\nprocess of stultified anthropomorphism which results from grafting\nChristianity upon an alien mythopoesis, he dons human attributes,\ntalking and acting as a man (H. F. Tozer). And here, in Calabria, he\nlingers in children’s fables, as “sdrago,” a mockery of his former self.",
        "To follow up his wondrous metamorphoses through medievalism would be a\npastime worthy of some leisured dilettante. How many noble shapes\nacquired a tinge of absurdity in the Middle Ages! Switzerland alone,\nwith its mystery of untrodden crevices, used to be crammed with\ndragons–particularly the calcareous (cavernous) province of Rhaetia.\nSecondary dragons; for the good monks saw to it that no reminiscences of\nthe autochthonous beast survived. Modern scholars have devoted much\nlearning to the local Tazzelwurm and Bergstutz. But dragons of our\nfamiliar kind were already well known to the chroniclers from whom old\nCysat extracted his twenty-fifth chapter (wherein, by the way, you will\nlearn something of Calabrian dragons); then came J. J. Wagner (1680);\nthen Scheuchzer, prince of dragon-finders, who informs us that multorum\ndraconum historta mendax.",
        "But it is rather a far cry from Calabria to the asthmatic Scheuchzer,\nwiping the perspiration off his brow as he clambers among the Alps to\nrecord truthful dragon yarns and untruthful barometrical observations;\nor to China, dragon-land par excellence; [Footnote: In Chinese\nmythology the telluric element has remained untarnished. The dragon is\nan earth-god, who controls the rain and thunder clouds.] or even to our\nown Heralds’ College, where these and other beasts have sought a refuge\nfrom prying professors under such queer disguises that their own mothers\nwould hardly recognize them.",
