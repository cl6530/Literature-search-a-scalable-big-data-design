        "Keesh lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea, was head man of his\nvillage through many and prosperous years, and died full of honors with\nhis name on the lips of men. So long ago did he live that only the old\nmen remember his name, his name and the tale, which they got from the\nold men before them, and which the old men to come will tell to their\nchildren and their children’s children down to the end of time. And the\nwinter darkness, when the north gales make their long sweep across the\nice-pack, and the air is filled with flying white, and no man may\nventure forth, is the chosen time for the telling of how Keesh, from the\npoorest igloo in the village, rose to power and place over them all.",
        "He was a bright boy, so the tale runs, healthy and strong, and he had\nseen thirteen suns, in their way of reckoning time. For each winter the\nsun leaves the land in darkness, and the next year a new sun returns so\nthat they may be warm again and look upon one another’s faces. The\nfather of Keesh had been a very brave man, but he had met his death in a\ntime of famine, when he sought to save the lives of his people by taking\nthe life of a great polar bear. In his eagerness he came to close\ngrapples with the bear, and his bones were crushed; but the bear had\nmuch meat on him and the people were saved. Keesh was his only son, and\nafter that Keesh lived alone with his mother. But the people are prone\nto forget, and they forgot the deed of his father; and he being but a\nboy, and his mother only a woman, they, too, were swiftly forgotten, and\nere long came to live in the meanest of all the igloos.",
        "It was at a council, one night, in the big igloo of Klosh-Kwan, the\nchief, that Keesh showed the blood that ran in his veins and the manhood\nthat stiffened his back. With the dignity of an elder, he rose to his\nfeet, and waited for silence amid the babble of voices.",
        "“It is true that meat be apportioned me and mine,” he said. “But it is\nofttimes old and tough, this meat, and, moreover, it has an unusual\nquantity of bones.”",
        "The hunters, grizzled and gray, and lusty and young, were aghast. The\nlike had never been known before. A child, that talked like a grown man,\nand said harsh things to their very faces!",
        "But steadily and with seriousness, Keesh went on. “For that I know my\nfather, Bok, was a great hunter, I speak these words. It is said that\nBok brought home more meat than any of the two best hunters, that with\nhis own hands he attended to the division of it, that with his own eyes\nhe saw to it that the least old woman and the least old man received\nfair share.”",
        "“Na! Na!” the men cried. “Put the child out!” “Send him off to bed!” “He\nis no man that he should talk to men and gray-beards!”",
        "He waited calmly till the uproar died down.",
        "“Thou hast a wife, Ugh-Gluk,” he said, “and for her dost thou speak. And\nthou, too, Massuk, a mother also, and for them dost thou speak. My\nmother has no one, save me; wherefore I speak. As I say, though Bok be\ndead because he hunted over-keenly, it is just that I, who am his son,\nand that Ikeega, who is my mother and was his wife, should have meat in\nplenty so long as there be meat in plenty in the tribe. I, Keesh, the\nson of Bok, have spoken.”",
        "He sat down, his ears keenly alert to the flood of protest and\nindignation his words had created.",
        "“That a boy should speak in council!” old Ugh-Gluk was mumbling.",
        "“Shall the babes in arms tell us men the things we shall do?” Massuk\ndemanded in a loud voice. “Am I a man that I should be made a mock by\nevery child that cries for meat?”",
        "The anger boiled a white heat. They ordered him to bed, threatened that\nhe should have no meat at all, and promised him sore beatings for his\npresumption. Keesh’s eyes began to flash, and the blood to pound darkly\nunder his skin. In the midst of the abuse he sprang to his feet.",
        "“Hear me, ye men!” he cried. “Never shall I speak in the council again,\nnever again till the men come to me and say, ’It is well, Keesh, that\nthou shouldst speak, it is well and it is our wish.’ Take this now, ye\nmen, for my last word. Bok, my father, was a great hunter. I too, his\nson, shall go and hunt the meat that I eat. And be it known, now, that\nthe division of that which I kill shall be fair. And no widow nor weak\none shall cry in the night because there is no meat, when the strong men\nare groaning in great pain for that they have eaten overmuch. And in the\ndays to come there shall be shame upon the strong men who have eaten\novermuch. I, Keesh, have said it!”",
        "Jeers and scornful laughter followed him out of the igloo, but his jaw\nwas set and he went his way, looking neither to right nor left.",
        "The next day he went forth along the shoreline where the ice and the\nland met together. Those who saw him go noted that he carried his bow,\nwith a goodly supply of bone-barbed arrows, and that across his shoulder\nwas his father’s big hunting-spear. And there was laughter, and much\ntalk, at the event. It was an unprecedented occurrence. Never did boys\nof his tender age go forth to hunt, much less to hunt alone. Also were\nthere shaking of heads and prophetic mutterings, and the women looked\npityingly at Ikeega, and her face was grave and sad.",
        "“He will be back ere long,” they said cheeringly.",
        "“Let him go; it will teach him a lesson,” the hunters said. “And he will\ncome back shortly, and he will be meek and soft of speech in the days to\nfollow.”",
        "But a day passed, and a second, and on the third a wild gale blew, and\nthere was no Keesh. Ikeega tore her hair and put soot of the seal-oil on\nher face in token of her grief; and the women assailed the men with\nbitter words in that they had mistreated the boy and sent him to his\ndeath; and the men made no answer, preparing to go in search of the body\nwhen the storm abated.",
        "Early next morning, however, Keesh strode into the village. But he came\nnot shamefacedly. Across his shoulders he bore a burden of fresh-killed\nmeat. And there was importance in his step and arrogance in his speech.",
        "“Go, ye men, with the dogs and sledges, and take my trail for the better\npart of a day’s travel,” he said. “There is much meat on the ice–a\nshe-bear and two half-grown cubs.”",
        "Ikeega was overcome with joy, but he received her demonstrations in\nmanlike fashion, saying: “Come, Ikeega, let us eat. And after that I\nshall sleep, for I am weary.”",
        "And he passed into their igloo and ate profoundly, and after that\nslept for twenty running hours.",
        "There was much doubt at first, much doubt and discussion. The killing of\na polar bear is very dangerous, but thrice dangerous is it, and three\ntimes thrice, to kill a mother bear with her cubs. The men could not\nbring themselves to believe that the boy Keesh, single-handed, had\naccomplished so great a marvel. But the women spoke of the fresh-killed\nmeat he had brought on his back, and this was an overwhelming argument\nagainst their unbelief. So they finally departed, grumbling greatly that\nin all probability, if the thing were so, he had neglected to cut up the\ncarcasses. Now in the north it is very necessary that this should be\ndone as soon as a kill is made. If not, the meat freezes so solidly as\nto turn the edge of the sharpest knife, and a three-hundred-pound bear,\nfrozen stiff, is no easy thing to put upon a sled and haul over the\nrough ice. But arrived at the spot, they found not only the kill which\nthey had doubted, but that Keesh had quartered the beasts in true hunter\nfashion, and removed the entrails.",
        "Thus began the mystery of Keesh, a mystery that deepened and deepened\nwith the passing of the days. His very next trip he killed a young bear,\nnearly full-grown, and on the trip following, a large male bear and his\nmate. He was ordinarily gone from three to four days, though it was\nnothing unusual for him to stay away a week at a time on the ice-field.\nAlways he declined company on these expeditions, and the people\nmarveled. “How does he do it?” they demanded of one another. “Never does\nhe take a dog with him, and dogs are of such great help, too.”",
        "“Why dost thou hunt only bear?” Klosh-Kwan once ventured to ask.",
        "And Keesh made fitting answer. “It is well known that there is more meat\non the bear,” he said.",
        "But there was also talk of witchcraft in the village. “He hunts with\nevil spirits,” some of the people contended, “wherefore his hunting is\nrewarded. How else can it be, save that he hunts with evil spirits?”",
        "“Mayhap they be not evil, but good, these spirits,” others said. “It is\nknown that his father was a mighty hunter. May not his father hunt with\nhim so that he may attain excellence and patience and understanding? Who\nknows?”",
        "None the less, his success continued, and the less skilful hunters were\noften kept busy hauling in his meat. And in the division of it he was\njust. As his father had done before him, he saw to it that the least old\nwoman and the last old man received a fair portion, keeping no more for\nhimself than his needs required. And because of this, and of his merit\nas a hunter, he was looked upon with respect, and even awe; and there\nwas talk of making him chief after old Klosh-Kwan. Because of the things\nhe had done, they looked for him to appear again in the council, but he\nnever came, and they were ashamed to ask.",
        "“I am minded to build me an igloo,” he said one day to Klosh-Kwan and\na number of the hunters. “It shall be a large igloo, wherein Ikeega\nand I can dwell in comfort.”",
        "“Ay,” they nodded gravely.",
        "“But I have no time. By business is hunting, and it takes all my time.\nSo it is but just that the men and women of the village who eat my meat\nshould build me my igloo.”",
        "And the igloo was built accordingly, on a generous scale which\nexceeded even the dwelling of Klosh-Kwan. Keesh and his mother moved\ninto it, and it was the first prosperity she had enjoyed since the death\nof Bok. Nor was material prosperity alone hers, for, because of her\nwonderful son and the position he had given her, she came to be looked\nupon as the first woman in all the village; and the women were given to\nvisiting her, to asking her advice, and to quoting her wisdom when\narguments arose among themselves or with the men.",
        "But it was the mystery of Keesh’s marvelous hunting that took chief\nplace in all their minds. And one day Ugh-Gluk taxed him with witchcraft\nto his face.",
        "“It is charged,” Ugh-Gluk said ominously, “that thou dealest with evil\nspirits, wherefore thy hunting is rewarded.”",
        "“Is not the meat good?” Keesh made answer. “Has one in the village yet\nto fall sick from the eating of it! How dost thou know that witchcraft\nbe concerned? Or dost thou guess, in the dark, merely because of the\nenvy that consumes thee?”",
        "And Ugh-Gluk withdrew discomfited, the women laughing at him as he\nwalked away. But in the council one night, after long deliberation, it\nwas determined to put spies on his track when he went forth to hunt, so\nthat his methods might be learned. So, on his next trip, Bim and Bawn,\ntwo young men, and of hunters the craftiest, followed after him, taking\ncare not to be seen. After five days they returned, their eyes bulging\nand their tongues a-tremble to tell what they had seen. The council was\nhastily called in Klosh-Kwan’s dwelling, and Bim took up the tale.",
        "“Brothers! As commanded, we journeyed on the trail of Keesh, and\ncunningly we journeyed, so that he might not know. And midway of the\nfirst day he picked up with a great he-bear. It was a very great bear.”",
        "“None greater,” Bawn corroborated, and went on himself. “Yet was the\nbear not inclined to fight, for he turned away and made off slowly over\nthe ice. This we saw from the rocks of the shore, and the bear came\ntoward us, and after him came Keesh, very much unafraid. And he shouted\nharsh words after the bear, and waved his arms about, and made much\nnoise. Then did the bear grow angry, and rise up on his hind legs, and\ngrowl. But Keesh walked right up to the bear.”",
        "“Ay,” Bim continued the story. “Right up to the bear Keesh walked. And\nthe bear took after him, and Keesh ran away. But as he ran he dropped a\nlittle round ball on the ice. And the bear stopped and smelled of it,\nand then swallowed it up. And Keesh continued to run away and drop\nlittle round balls, and the bear continued to swallow them up.”",
        "Exclamations and cries of doubt were being made, and Ugh-Gluk expressed\nopen unbelief.",
        "“With our own eyes we saw it,” Bim affirmed.",
        "And Bawn–\"Ay, with our own eyes. And this continued until the bear\nstood suddenly upright and cried aloud in pain, and thrashed his\nforepaws madly about. And Keesh continued to make off over the ice to a\nsafe distance. But the bear gave him no notice, being occupied with the\nmisfortune the little round balls had wrought within him.”",
        "“Ay, within him,” Bim interrupted. “For he did claw at himself, and\nleap about over the ice like a playful puppy, save from the way he\ngrowled and squealed it was plain it was not play but pain. Never did I\nsee such a sight!”",
        "“Nay, never was such a sight seen,” Bawn took up the strain. “And\nfurthermore, it was such a large bear.”",
        "“Witchcraft,” Ugh-Gluk suggested.",
        "“I know not,” Bawn replied. “I tell only of what my eyes beheld. And\nafter a while the bear grew weak and tired, for he was very heavy and he\nhad jumped about with exceeding violence, and he went off along the\nshore-ice, shaking his head slowly from side to side and sitting down\never and again to squeal and cry. And Keesh followed after the bear, and\nwe followed after Keesh, and for that day and three days more we\nfollowed. The bear grew weak, and never ceased crying from his pain.”",
        "“It was a charm!” Ugh-Gluk exclaimed. “Surely it was a charm!”",
        "“It may well be.”",
        "And Bim relieved Bawn. “The bear wandered, now this way and now that,\ndoubling back and forth and crossing his trail in circles, so that at\nthe end he was near where Keesh had first come upon him. By this time he\nwas quite sick, the bear, and could crawl no farther, so Keesh came up\nclose and speared him to death.”",
        "“And then?” Klosh-Kwan demanded.",
        "“Then we left Keesh skinning the bear, and came running that the news of\nthe killing might be told.”",
        "And in the afternoon of that day the women hauled in the meat of the\nbear while the men sat in council assembled. When Keesh arrived a\nmessenger was sent to him, bidding him come to the council. But he sent\nreply, saying that he was hungry and tired; also that his igloo was\nlarge and comfortable and could hold many men.",
        "And curiosity was so strong on the men that the whole council,\nKlosh-Kwan to the fore, rose up and went to the igloo of Keesh. He was\neating, but he received them with respect and seated them according to\ntheir rank. Ikeega was proud and embarrassed by turns, but Keesh was\nquite composed.",
        "Klosh-Kwan recited the information brought by Bim and Bawn, and at its\nclose said in a stern voice: “So explanation is wanted, O Keesh, of thy\nmanner of hunting. Is there witchcraft in it?”",
        "Keesh looked up and smiled. “Nay, O Klosh-Kwan. It is not for a boy to\nknow aught of witches, and of witches I know nothing. I have but devised\na means whereby I may kill the ice-bear with ease, that is all. It be\nheadcraft, not witchcraft.”",
        "“And may any man?”",
        "“Any man.”",
        "There was a long silence. The men looked in one another’s faces, and\nKeesh went on eating.",
        "“And ... and ... and wilt thou tell us, O Keesh?” Klosh-Kwan finally\nasked in a tremulous voice.",
        "“Yea, I will tell thee.” Keesh finished sucking a marrow-bone and rose\nto his feet. “It is quite simple. Behold!”",
        "He picked up a thin strip of whalebone and showed it to them. The ends\nwere sharp as needle-points. The strip he coiled carefully, till it\ndisappeared in his hand. Then, suddenly releasing it, it sprang straight\nagain. He picked up a piece of blubber.",
        "“So,” he said, “one takes a small chunk of blubber, thus, and thus makes\nit hollow. Then into the hollow goes the whalebone, so, tightly coiled,\nand another piece of blubber is fitted over the whalebone. After that it\nis put outside where it freezes into a little round ball. The bear\nswallows the little round ball, the blubber melts, the whalebone with\nits sharp ends stands out straight, the bear gets sick, and when the\nbear is very sick, why, you kill him with a spear. It is quite simple.”",
        "And Ugh-Gluk said “Oh!” and Klosh-Kwan said “Ah!” And each said\nsomething after his own manner, and all understood.",
        "And this is the story of Keesh, who lived long ago on the rim of the\npolar sea. Because he exercised headcraft and not witchcraft, he rose\nfrom the meanest igloo to be head man of his village, and through all\nthe years that he lived, it is related, his tribe was prosperous, and\nneither widow nor weak one cried aloud in the night because there was no\nmeat.",
