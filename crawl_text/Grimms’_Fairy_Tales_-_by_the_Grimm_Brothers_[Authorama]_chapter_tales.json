        "A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree\nwhich bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about\nthe time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night\none of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered\nthe gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set\nhis eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and\nin the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son\nwas ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the\nmorning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep\nwatch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm\nshould come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man\nlaid himself under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he\nheard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of\npure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak,\nthe gardener’s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow\ndid the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail,\nand then flew away. The golden feather was brought to the king in the\nmorning, and all the council was called together. Everyone agreed that\nit was worth more than all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king\nsaid, ’One feather is of no use to me, I must have the whole bird.’",
        "Then the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden\nbird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a\nwood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his\nbow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ’Do not shoot\nme, for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is,\nand that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in\nthe evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to\neach other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go\nnot in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may\nappear to you to be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to\nhimself, ’What can such a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he\nshot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail\nabove its back and ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the\nevening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of\nthese were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other\nlooked very dirty, and poor. ’I should be very silly,’ said he, ’if I\nwent to that shabby house, and left this charming place’; so he went\ninto the smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the\nbird, and his country too.",
        "Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no\ntidings were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing\nhappened to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but\nwhen he came to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the\nwindow where the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he\ncould not withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden\nbird and his country in the same manner.",
        "Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\nthe wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\nlisten to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\nwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent\nhis coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he\nwould not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox,\nand heard the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and\ndid not attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said,\n’Sit upon my tail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and\nthe fox began to run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick\nthat their hair whistled in the wind.",
        "When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and\nwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\nnight at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\nwas beginning his journey, and said, ’Go straight forward, till you\ncome to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast\nasleep and snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and\npass on and on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in\na wooden cage; close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not\ntry to take the bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the\nhandsome one, otherwise you will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched\nout his tail again, and the young man sat himself down, and away they\nwent over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.",
        "Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\nand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\nbelow stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\nlost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, ’It will be a\nvery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’;\nso he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden\ncage. But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers\nawoke, and they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The\nnext morning the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it\nsentenced him to die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse\nwhich could run as swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to\nhave the golden bird given him for his own.",
        "So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\nwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ’You see now\nwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I\nwill still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you\nwill do as I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the\ncastle where the horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the\ngroom fast asleep and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be\nsure to put the old leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one\nthat is close by it.’ Then the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and\naway they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the\nwind.",
        "All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the\ngolden saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a\ngreat pity to put the leathern saddle upon it. ’I will give him the\ngood one,’ said he; ’I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the\ngolden saddle the groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the\nguards ran in and took him prisoner, and in the morning he was again\nbrought before the court to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But\nit was agreed, that, if he could bring thither the beautiful princess,\nhe should live, and have the bird and the horse given him for his own.",
        "Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said,\n’Why did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away\nboth the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go\nstraight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve\no’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her\nand give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care\nyou do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock\nand stone till their hair whistled again.",
        "As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve\no’clock the young man met the princes going to the bath and gave her\nthe kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many\ntears that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he\nrefused, but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till\nat last he consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house\nthe guards awoke and he was taken prisoner again.",
        "Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ’You shall\nnever have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that\nstops the view from my window.’ Now this hill was so big that the\nwhole world could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven\ndays, and had done very little, the fox came and said. ’Lie down and\ngo to sleep; I will work for you.’ And in the morning he awoke and the\nhill was gone; so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now\nthat it was removed he must give him the princess.",
        "Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young\nman and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ’We will have\nall three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’ ’Ah!’ said the\nyoung man, ’that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’",
        "’If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ’it can be done. When you\ncome to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must\nsay, “Here she is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount\nthe golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to\ntake leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift\nher quickly on to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side,\nand gallop away as fast as you can.’",
        "All went right: then the fox said, ’When you come to the castle where\nthe bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will\nride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right\nhorse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say\nthat you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden\nbird; and when you get it into your hand, ride away.’",
        "This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the\nprincess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox\ncame, and said, ’Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But\nthe young man refused to do it: so the fox said, ’I will at any rate\ngive you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the\ngallows, and sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went.\n’Well,’ thought the young man, ’it is no hard matter to keep that\nadvice.’",
        "He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village\nwhere he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise\nand uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said,\n’Two men are going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the\ntwo men were his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ’Cannot\nthey in any way be saved?’ But the people said ’No,’ unless he would\nbestow all his money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he\ndid not stay to think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and\nhis brothers were given up, and went on with him towards their home.",
        "And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\ncool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ’Let us sit down by the\nside of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,\n’Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\nriver; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\ndown the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and\nwent home to the king their master, and said. ’All this have we won by\nour labour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would\nnot eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.",
        "The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was\nnearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so\nsteep that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once\nmore, and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil\nwould have befallen him: ’Yet,’ said he, ’I cannot leave you here, so\nlay hold of my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the\nriver, and said to him, as he got upon the bank, ’Your brothers have\nset watch to kill you, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed\nhimself as a poor man, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was\nscarcely within the doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to\nsing, and princess left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and\ntold him all his brothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished,\nand he had the princess given to him again; and after the king’s death\nhe was heir to his kingdom.",
        "A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old\nfox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and\ncut off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the\nfox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\nprincess, who had been lost a great many many years.",
        "Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes right–\nall that falls to them is so much gain–all their geese are swans–all\ntheir cards are trumps–toss them which way you will, they will\nalways, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so\nmuch the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as\nthey think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can\nit know about the matter?",
        "One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had\nworked hard for his master. At last he said, ’Master, my time is up; I\nmust go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages\nand let me go.’ And the master said, ’You have been a faithful and\ngood servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a\nlump of silver as big as his head.",
        "Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into\nit, threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards.\nAs he went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in\nsight, trotting gaily along on a capital horse. ’Ah!’ said Hans aloud,\n’what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy\nand happy as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips\nagainst no stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows\nhow.’ Hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and\nsaid, ’Well, friend, why do you go on foot then?’ ’Ah!’ said he, ’I\nhave this load to carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy\nthat I can’t hold up my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder\nsadly.’ ’What do you say of making an exchange?’ said the horseman. ’I\nwill give you my horse, and you shall give me the silver; which will\nsave you a great deal of trouble in carrying such a heavy load about\nwith you.’ ’With all my heart,’ said Hans: ’but as you are so kind to\nme, I must tell you one thing–you will have a weary task to draw that\nsilver about with you.’ However, the horseman got off, took the\nsilver, helped Hans up, gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip\ninto the other, and said, ’When you want to go very fast, smack your\nlips loudly together, and cry “Jip!\"’",
        "Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared\nhis elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily\noff, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,",
        " ’No care and no sorrow,\n  A fig for the morrow!\n  We’ll laugh and be merry,\n  Sing neigh down derry!’",
        "After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he\nsmacked his lips and cried ’Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and\nbefore Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his\nback by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who\nwas coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to\nhimself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the\nshepherd, ’This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon\na beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would\nbreak his neck. However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now\na great deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick,\nand has spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the\nby, smells not very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one’s\nleisure behind that cow–keep good company, and have milk, butter, and\ncheese, every day, into the bargain. What would I give to have such a\nprize!’ ’Well,’ said the shepherd, ’if you are so fond of her, I will\nchange my cow for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even\nthough I lose by it myself.’ ’Done!’ said Hans, merrily. ’What a noble\nheart that good man has!’ thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon\nthe horse, wished Hans and the cow good morning, and away he rode.",
        "Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and\nthen drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky\none. ’If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be\nable to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese\nwith it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk:\nand what can I wish for more?’ When he came to an inn, he halted, ate\nup all his bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer.\nWhen he had rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards\nhis mother’s village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came\non, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take\nhim more than an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that\nhis tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. ’I can find a cure for\nthis,’ thought he; ’now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so\nhe tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk\ninto; but not a drop was to be had. Who would have thought that this\ncow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese, was all that\ntime utterly dry? Hans had not thought of looking to that.",
        "While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\nclumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at\nlast gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there\nhe lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving\na pig in a wheelbarrow. ’What is the matter with you, my man?’ said\nthe butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how\nhe was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too.\nThen the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ’There, drink and\nrefresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is\nan old beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ’Alas, alas!’\nsaid Hans, ’who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse,\nand give me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for?\nI hate cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now\n–like that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease–one could\ndo something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ’Well,’\nsaid the butcher, ’I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a\nkind, neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my\nfine fat pig for the cow.’ ’Heaven reward you for your kindness and\nself-denial!’ said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking\nthe pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string\nthat was tied to its leg.",
        "So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met\nwith some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.\nHow could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had\nat last got?",
        "The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The\ncountryman stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to further chat;\nand Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and\nhow all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman than\nbegan to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a\nchristening. ’Feel,’ said he, ’how heavy it is, and yet it is only\neight weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat\nupon it, it has lived so well!’ ’You’re right,’ said Hans, as he\nweighed it in his hand; ’but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’\nMeantime the countryman began to look grave, and shook his head. ’Hark\nye!’ said he, ’my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I\ncan’t help doing you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape.\nIn the village I just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out\nof his sty. I was dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got\nthe squire’s pig. If you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad\njob for you. The least they will do will be to throw you into the\nhorse-pond. Can you swim?’",
        "Poor Hans was sadly frightened. ’Good man,’ cried he, ’pray get me out\nof this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or\nborn; but he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know\nthis country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ’I\nought to have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ’give\na fat goose for a pig, indeed! ’Tis not everyone would do so much for\nyou as that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in\ntrouble.’ Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig\nby a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care.\n’After all,’ thought he, ’that chap is pretty well taken in. I don’t\ncare whose pig it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very\ngood friend to me. I have much the best of the bargain. First there\nwill be a capital roast; then the fat will find me in goose-grease for\nsix months; and then there are all the beautiful white feathers. I\nwill put them into my pillow, and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly\nwithout rocking. How happy my mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed!\nGive me a fine fat goose.’",
        "As he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his\nwheel, working and singing,",
        " ’O’er hill and o’er dale\n  So happy I roam,\n  Work light and live well,\n  All the world is my home;\n  Then who so blythe, so merry as I?’",
        "Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ’You must be well\noff, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.’ ’Yes,’ said the\nother, ’mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand\ninto his pocket without finding money in it–but where did you get\nthat beautiful goose?’ ’I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.’ ’And\nwhere did you get the pig?’ ’I gave a cow for it.’ ’And the cow?’ ’I\ngave a horse for it.’ ’And the horse?’ ’I gave a lump of silver as big\nas my head for it.’ ’And the silver?’ ’Oh! I worked hard for that\nseven long years.’ ’You have thriven well in the world hitherto,’ said\nthe grinder, ’now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you\nput your hand in it, your fortune would be made.’ ’Very true: but how\nis that to be managed?’ ’How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,’\nsaid the other; ’you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of\nitself. Here is one that is but little the worse for wear: I would not\nask more than the value of your goose for it–will you buy?’ ’How can\nyou ask?’ said Hans; ’I should be the happiest man in the world, if I\ncould have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I\nwant more? there’s the goose.’ ’Now,’ said the grinder, as he gave him\na common rough stone that lay by his side, ’this is a most capital\nstone; do but work it well enough, and you can make an old nail cut\nwith it.’",
        "Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes\nsparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ’Surely I must have been\nborn in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of\nitself. People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a\nfavour in letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.’",
        "Meantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away\nhis last penny in his joy at getting the cow.",
        "At last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he\ndragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of\nwater, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on\nthe bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a\nlittle, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.",
        "For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang\nup and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked\nHeaven, with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his\nonly plague, the ugly heavy stone.",
        "’How happy am I!’ cried he; ’nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up\nhe got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on\ntill he reached his mother’s house, and told her how very easy the\nroad to good luck was.",
        "There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep\ngloomy wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy\ncould take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in\nthe form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at\nnight she always became an old woman again. When any young man came\nwithin a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could\nnot move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do\ntill he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any\npretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and\nthe fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the\ncastle. There were seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle,\nand all with beautiful birds in them.",
        "Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier\nthan all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd\nlad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon\nto be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might\nbe alone; and Jorindel said, ’We must take care that we don’t go too\nnear to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays\nof the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees\nupon the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the\ntall birches.",
        "Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and\nboth felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be\nparted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and\nwhen they looked to see which way they should go home, they found\nthemselves at a loss to know what path to take.",
        "The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk\nbehind the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw\nthrough the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close\nunder the old walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned\npale, and trembled. Jorinda was just singing,",
        " ’The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\n  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!\n  He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,\n  Well-a-day!’",
        "when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and\nbeheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended\nwith a mournful /jug, jug/. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times\nround them, and three times screamed:",
        " ’Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’",
        "Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither\nweep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite\ndown; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment\nafter the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and\na nose and chin that almost met one another.",
        "She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went\naway with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone–\nbut what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the\nspot where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a\nhoarse voice:",
        " ’Till the prisoner is fast,\n  And her doom is cast,\n  There stay! Oh, stay!\n  When the charm is around her,\n  And the spell has bound her,\n  Hie away! away!’",
        "On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees\nbefore the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda:\nbut she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then\nshe went her way.",
        "He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ’Alas!’ he said,\n’what will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he\nwent to a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many\na time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he\ndared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.",
        "At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,\nand that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he\nplucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and\nthat everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\nfound his Jorinda again.",
        "In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale\nfor this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain:\nbut on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful\npurple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as\na costly pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled\nday and night, till he came again to the castle.",
        "He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become\nfixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the\ndoor. Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the\ndoor with the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through\nthe court, and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last\nhe came to the chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred\nbirds singing in the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she\nwas very angry, and screamed with rage; but she could not come within\ntwo yards of him, for the flower he held in his hand was his\nsafeguard. He looked around at the birds, but alas! there were many,\nmany nightingales, and how then should he find out which was his\nJorinda? While he was thinking what to do, he saw the fairy had taken\ndown one of the cages, and was making the best of her way off through\nthe door. He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower,\nand Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck\nlooking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked\ntogether in the wood.",
        "Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all\ntook their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were\nmarried, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many\nother lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s\ncages by themselves, much longer than they liked.",
        "An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to\nhim a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and\nmore unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and\nbegan to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that\nsome mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his\njourney towards the great city, ’For there,’ thought he, ’I may turn\nmusician.’",
        "After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the\nroadside and panting as if he were tired. ’What makes you pant so, my\nfriend?’ said the ass. ’Alas!’ said the dog, ’my master was going to\nknock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer\nmake myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do\nto earn my livelihood?’ ’Hark ye!’ said the ass, ’I am going to the\ngreat city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you\ncan do in the same way?’ The dog said he was willing, and they jogged\non together.",
        "They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of\nthe road and making a most rueful face. ’Pray, my good lady,’ said the\nass, ’what’s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’ ’Ah,\nme!’ said the cat, ’how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is\nin danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at\nmy ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my\nmistress laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have\nbeen lucky enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to\nlive upon.’ ’Oh,’ said the ass, ’by all means go with us to the great\ncity; you are a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a\nmusician.’ The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.",
        "Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\nperched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.\n’Bravo!’ said the ass; ’upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray\nwhat is all this about?’ ’Why,’ said the cock, ’I was just now saying\nthat we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my\nmistress and the cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut\noff my head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are\ncoming on Sunday!’ ’Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ’come with us Master\nChanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have\nyour head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we\nmay get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ’With all\nmy heart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.",
        "They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when\nnight came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog\nlaid themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into\nthe branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the\nsafer he should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then,\naccording to his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all\nsides of him to see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw\nafar off something bright and shining and calling to his companions\nsaid, ’There must be a house no great way off, for I see a light.’ ’If\nthat be the case,’ said the ass, ’we had better change our quarters,\nfor our lodging is not the best in the world!’ ’Besides,’ added the\ndog, ’I should not be the worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’\nSo they walked off together towards the spot where Chanticleer had\nseen the light, and as they drew near it became larger and brighter,\ntill they at last came close to a house in which a gang of robbers\nlived.",
        "The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window\nand peeped in. ’Well, Donkey,’ said Chanticleer, ’what do you see?’\n’What do I see?’ replied the ass. ’Why, I see a table spread with all\nkinds of good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.’\n’That would be a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock. ’Yes,’ said the\nass, ’if we could only get in’; so they consulted together how they\nshould contrive to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a\nplan. The ass placed himself upright on his hind legs, with his\nforefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the\ncat scrambled up to the dog’s shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat\nupon the cat’s head. When all was ready a signal was given, and they\nbegan their music. The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and\nthe cock screamed; and then they all broke through the window at once,\nand came tumbling into the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most\nhideous clatter! The robbers, who had been not a little frightened by\nthe opening concert, had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin\nhad broken in upon them, and scampered away as fast as they could.",
        "The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what\nthe robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not\nexpected to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied\nthemselves, they put out the lights, and each once more sought out a\nresting-place to his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a\nheap of straw in the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind\nthe door, the cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm\nashes, and the cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and,\nas they were all rather tired with their journey, they soon fell\nasleep.",
        "But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights\nwere out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had\nbeen in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder\nthan the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything\nstill, he marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a\nmatch in order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering\nfiery eyes of the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the\nmatch to them to light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke,\nsprang at his face, and spat, and scratched at him. This frightened\nhim dreadfully, and away he ran to the back door; but there the dog\njumped up and bit him in the leg; and as he was crossing over the yard\nthe ass kicked him; and the cock, who had been awakened by the noise,\ncrowed with all his might. At this the robber ran back as fast as he\ncould to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got\ninto the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her\nlong bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden\nhimself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black\nmonster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the\ndevil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, ’Throw the\nrascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go back to the\nhouse; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they\ntook up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this\nvery day.",
        "A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,\nand had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife\nwere standing together before the house the shepherd said, ’I will\nshoot old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his\nwife said, ’Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us\nwell a great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the\nrest of his days.’ ’But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd,\n’he has not a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at\nall; to be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his\nlivelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’",
        "Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd\nand his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to\nthink tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his\ngood friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his\nsorrows, and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ’Make\nyourself easy,’ said the wolf, ’I will give you some good advice. Your\nmaster, you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into\nthe field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down\nbehind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie\ndown close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will\ncome out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as\nfast as you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back,\nand they will think you have saved their child, and will be so\nthankful to you that they will take care of you as long as you live.’\nThe dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed.\nThe wolf ran with the child a little way; the shepherd and his wife\nscreamed out; but Sultan soon overtook him, and carried the poor\nlittle thing back to his master and mistress. Then the shepherd patted\nhim on the head, and said, ’Old Sultan has saved our child from the\nwolf, and therefore he shall live and be well taken care of, and have\nplenty to eat. Wife, go home, and give him a good dinner, and let him\nhave my old cushion to sleep on as long as he lives.’ So from this\ntime forward Sultan had all that he could wish for.",
        "Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ’Now, my\ngood fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way\nwhen I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ’No,’\nsaid the Sultan; ’I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf\nthought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But\nSultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait\nfor him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out\nfor a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that\ncombed his locks for him finely.",
        "Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ’an old rogue,’ and\nswore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the\nboar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter.\nNow Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s\nold three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing\nlimped along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the\nair.",
        "The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they\nespied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing\nstraight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan\nto fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking\nup a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this\nway of fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf\njumped up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked\nabout and wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not\nquite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he\nshook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and\nthinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so\nthat the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ’Look\nup in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked\nup, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called\nhim a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer him to come down till he\nwas heartily ashamed of himself, and had promised to be good friends\nagain with old Sultan.",
        "In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\nof beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth,\nand that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of\nstraw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped\nwithout her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and\nsoon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two.\nThen the straw began and said: ’Dear friends, from whence do you come\nhere?’ The coal replied: ’I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if\nI had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain,–I\nshould have been burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ’I too have escaped\nwith a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I\nshould have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’\n’And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ’The\nold woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized\nsixty of them at once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through\nher fingers.’",
        "’But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.",
        "’I think,’ answered the bean, ’that as we have so fortunately escaped\ndeath, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\nmischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\nrepair to a foreign country.’",
        "The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\ntogether. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\nno bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\nit. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ’I will lay myself\nstraight across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The\nstraw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the\ncoal, who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to\nthe newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard\nthe water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood\nstill, and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn,\nbroke in two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after\nher, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The\nbean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but\nlaugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that\nshe burst. It would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good\nfortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of work, had not sat\ndown to rest by the brook. As he had a compassionate heart he pulled\nout his needle and thread, and sewed her together. The bean thanked\nhim most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans\nsince then have a black seam.",
        "A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way\noff, where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen\nhad plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of\ngood things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day:\nbut though they had been married many years they had no children, and\nthis grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was\nwalking by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw\na poor little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay\ngasping and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the\nlittle fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it\nswam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, ’I know what\nyour wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness\nto me–you will soon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had\nforetold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very\nbeautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy, and\nsaid he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to\nall the land. So he asked his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and\nneighbours. But the queen said, ’I will have the fairies also, that\nthey might be kind and good to our little daughter.’ Now there were\nthirteen fairies in the kingdom; but as the king and queen had only\ntwelve golden dishes for them to eat out of, they were forced to leave\none of the fairies without asking her. So twelve fairies came, each\nwith a high red cap on her head, and red shoes with high heels on her\nfeet, and a long white wand in her hand: and after the feast was over\nthey gathered round in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the\nlittle princess. One gave her goodness, another beauty, another\nriches, and so on till she had all that was good in the world.",
        "Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard\nin the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was\ncome, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a\nbroomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-\nhall. Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry,\nand scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her\nrevenge. So she cried out, ’The king’s daughter shall, in her\nfifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the\ntwelfth of the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came\nforward, and said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she\ncould soften its mischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter,\nwhen the spindle wounded her, should not really die, but should only\nfall asleep for a hundred years.",
        "However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from\nthe threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the\nkingdom should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first\neleven fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so\nbeautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who\nknew her loved her.",
        "It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king\nand queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So\nshe roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers,\ntill at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow\nstaircase ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden\nkey, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old\nlady spinning away very busily. ’Why, how now, good mother,’ said the\nprincess; ’what are you doing there?’ ’Spinning,’ said the old lady,\nand nodded her head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ’How\nprettily that little thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took\nthe spindle and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched\nit, before the fairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded\nher, and she fell down lifeless on the ground.",
        "However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and\nthe king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,\nfell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in\nthe court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon\nthe walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to\nsleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a\ngoose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was\nat that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box\non the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell\nasleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with\nthe jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept\nsoundly.",
        "A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it\nbecame higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded\nand hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen.\nBut there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping\nBriar Rose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time\nto time, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the\nthicket into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do;\nfor the thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands;\nand there they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.",
        "After many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an\nold man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a\nbeautiful palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called\nBriar Rose, lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he\nhad heard from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and\nhad tried to break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck\nfast in it, and died. Then the young prince said, ’All this shall not\nfrighten me; I will go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to\nhinder him, but he was bent upon going.",
        "Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came\nto the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through\nwhich he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.\nThen he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the\ndogs asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the\nroof sat the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings.\nAnd when he came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the\nwalls; the spit was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at\nhis lips, going to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her\nlap ready to be plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding\nup her hand, as if she was going to beat the boy.",
        "Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\nevery breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and\nopened the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there\nshe lay, fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful\nthat he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave\nher a kiss. But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and\nawoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the\nking and queen also awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other\nwith great wonder. And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs\njumped up and barked; the pigeons took their heads from under their\nwings, and looked about and flew into the fields; the flies on the\nwalls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up; round went the\njack, and round went the spit, with the goose for the king’s dinner\nupon it; the butler finished his draught of ale; the maid went on\nplucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box on his ear.",
        "And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast\nwas given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.",
        "A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let\nhim suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so\nhe took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.\nOn the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ’Why are you so sad, my\nfriend?’ ’Because,’ said the dog, ’I am very very hungry, and have\nnothing to eat.’ ’If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ’come with me\ninto the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on\nthey went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s\nshop, the sparrow said to the dog, ’Stand there a little while till I\npeck you down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf:\nand having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was\nwatching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the\nedge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it\nup, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all\nup. ’Well,’ said the sparrow, ’you shall have some more if you will;\nso come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down another\nsteak.’ When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him,\n’Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?’ ’I have had plenty of\nmeat,’ answered he, ’but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat\nafter it.’ ’Come with me then,’ said the sparrow, ’and you shall soon\nhave that too.’ So she took him to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two\nrolls that lay in the window, till they fell down: and as the dog\nstill wished for more, she took him to another shop and pecked down\nsome more for him. When that was eaten, the sparrow asked him whether\nhe had had enough now. ’Yes,’ said he; ’and now let us take a walk a\nlittle way out of the town.’ So they both went out upon the high road;\nbut as the weather was warm, they had not gone far before the dog\nsaid, ’I am very much tired–I should like to take a nap.’ ’Very\nwell,’ answered the sparrow, ’do so, and in the meantime I will perch\nupon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the road, and\nfell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with a cart\ndrawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The sparrow,\nseeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would go on in\nthe track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called out,\n’Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the\ncarter, grumbling to himself, ’You make it the worse for me, indeed!\nwhat can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor\ndog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ’There,’ cried the\nsparrow, ’thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now\nmind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art\nworth.’ ’Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ’what harm can\nyou do me?’ and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the\ncart, and pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it;\nand than all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last\nhe looked round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask\nquite empty. ’What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ’Not wretch\nenough yet!’ said the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of\nthe horses, and pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the\ncarter saw this, he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the\nsparrow, meaning to kill her; but she flew away, and the blow fell\nupon the poor horse’s head with such force, that he fell down dead.\n’Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried he. ’Not wretch enough yet!’ said\nthe sparrow. And as the carter went on with the other two horses, she\nagain crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked out the bung of the\nsecond cask, so that all the wine ran out. When the carter saw this,\nhe again cried out, ’Miserable wretch that I am!’ But the sparrow\nanswered, ’Not wretch enough yet!’ and perched on the head of the\nsecond horse, and pecked at him too. The carter ran up and struck at\nher again with his hatchet; but away she flew, and the blow fell upon\nthe second horse and killed him on the spot. ’Unlucky wretch that I\nam!’ said he. ’Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow; and perching\nupon the third horse, she began to peck him too. The carter was mad\nwith fury; and without looking about him, or caring what he was about,\nstruck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the\nother two. ’Alas! miserable wretch that I am!’ cried he. ’Not wretch\nenough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew away; ’now will I plague\nand punish thee at thy own house.’ The carter was forced at last to\nleave his cart behind him, and to go home overflowing with rage and\nvexation. ’Alas!’ said he to his wife, ’what ill luck has befallen me!\n–my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three dead.’ ’Alas!\nhusband,’ replied she, ’and a wicked bird has come into the house, and\nhas brought with her all the birds in the world, I am sure, and they\nhave fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it up at such a\nrate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of birds\nsitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the\nmidst of them. ’Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he\nsaw that the corn was almost all gone. ’Not wretch enough yet!’ said\nthe sparrow; ’thy cruelty shall cost thee they life yet!’ and away she\nflew.",
        "The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down\ninto his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but\nsat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow\nsat on the outside of the window, and cried ’Carter! thy cruelty shall\ncost thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his\nhatchet, and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only\nbroke the window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-\nseat, and cried, ’Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became\nmad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force\nthat he cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place,\nthe carter and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their\nfurniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls,\nwithout touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught\nher: and the wife said, ’Shall I kill her at once?’ ’No,’ cried he,\n’that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel\ndeath; I will eat her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and\nstretch out her neck and cried, ’Carter! it shall cost thee thy life\nyet!’ With that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the\nhatchet, and cried, ’Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my\nhand.’ And the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her\nhusband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew\nquietly home to her nest.",
        "There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in\ntwelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were\nshut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be\nquite worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet\nnobody could find out how it happened, or where they had been.",
        "Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could\ndiscover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses\ndanced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his\nwife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did\nnot succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.",
        "A king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening\nwas taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in\ntheir twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to\ndance; and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it,\nthe door of his chamber was left open. But the king’s son soon fell\nasleep; and when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses\nhad all been dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes.\nThe same thing happened the second and third night: so the king\nordered his head to be cut off. After him came several others; but\nthey had all the same luck, and all lost their lives in the same\nmanner.",
        "Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and\ncould fight no longer, passed through the country where this king\nreigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,\nwho asked him where he was going. ’I hardly know where I am going, or\nwhat I had better do,’ said the soldier; ’but I think I should like\nvery well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then\nin time I might be a king.’ ’Well,’ said the old dame, ’that is no\nvery hard task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one\nof the princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she\nleaves you pretend to be fast asleep.’",
        "Then she gave him a cloak, and said, ’As soon as you put that on you\nwill become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the\nprincesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good\ncounsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and\nsaid he was willing to undertake the task.",
        "He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered\nfine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led\nto the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of\nthe princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all\naway secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself\ndown on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if\nhe was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed\nheartily; and the eldest said, ’This fellow too might have done a\nwiser thing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and\nopened their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes,\nand dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were\neager to begin dancing. But the youngest said, ’I don’t know how it\nis, while you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some\nmischance will befall us.’ ’You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ’you are\nalways afraid; have you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already\nwatched in vain? And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him\nhis sleeping draught, he would have slept soundly enough.’",
        "When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he\nsnored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were\nquite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her\nhands, and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The\nsoldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another,\nthe eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he\njumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and\nfollowed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of\nthe youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ’All is not\nright; someone took hold of my gown.’ ’You silly creature!’ said the\neldest, ’it is nothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all\nwent, and at the bottom they found themselves in a most delightful\ngrove of trees; and the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and\nsparkled beautifully. The soldier wished to take away some token of\nthe place; so he broke off a little branch, and there came a loud\nnoise from the tree. Then the youngest daughter said again, ’I am sure\nall is not right–did not you hear that noise? That never happened\nbefore.’ But the eldest said, ’It is only our princes, who are\nshouting for joy at our approach.’",
        "Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of\ngold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering\ndiamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time\nthere was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with\nfear; but the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were\ncrying for joy. So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at\nthe side of the lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve\nhandsome princes in them, who seemed to be waiting there for the\nprincesses.",
        "One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped\ninto the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the\nlake, the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and\nthe soldier said, ’I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing\nwith all my might we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite\ntired: the boat seems very heavy today.’ ’It is only the heat of the\nweather,’ said the princess: ’I feel it very warm too.’",
        "On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from\nwhich came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all\nlanded, and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his\nprincess; and the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with\nthem too; and when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her,\nhe drank it all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was\nempty. At this, too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but\nthe eldest always silenced her. They danced on till three o’clock in\nthe morning, and then all their shoes were worn out, so that they were\nobliged to leave off. The princes rowed them back again over the lake\n(but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest\nprincess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other,\nthe princesses promising to come again the next night.",
        "When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the\nprincesses, and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly\ncame up very much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they\nsaid, ’Now all is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put\naway their fine clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In\nthe morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened, but\ndetermined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the\nsecond and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the\nprincesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces, and\nthen returned home. However, on the third night the soldier carried\naway one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been.",
        "As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was\ntaken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and\nthe twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he\nwould say. And when the king asked him. ’Where do my twelve daughters\ndance at night?’ he answered, ’With twelve princes in a castle under\nground.’ And then he told the king all that had happened, and showed\nhim the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with\nhim. Then the king called for the princesses, and asked them whether\nwhat the soldier said was true: and when they saw that they were\ndiscovered, and that it was of no use to deny what had happened, they\nconfessed it all. And the king asked the soldier which of them he\nwould choose for his wife; and he answered, ’I am not very young, so I\nwill have the eldest.’–And they were married that very day, and the\nsoldier was chosen to be the king’s heir.",
        "There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close\nby the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing;\nand one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the\nsparkling waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was\ndragged away deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a\ngreat fish. But the fish said, ’Pray let me live! I am not a real\nfish; I am an enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me\ngo!’ ’Oh, ho!’ said the man, ’you need not make so many words about\nthe matter; I will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so\nswim away, sir, as soon as you please!’ Then he put him back into the\nwater, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a\nlong streak of blood behind him on the wave.",
        "When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her\nhow he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an\nenchanted prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go\nagain. ’Did not you ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ’we live very\nwretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the\nfish we want a snug little cottage.’",
        "The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the\nseashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and\ngreen. And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:",
        " ’O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’",
        "Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ’Well, what is her will?\nWhat does your wife want?’ ’Ah!’ said the fisherman, ’she says that\nwhen I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before\nI let you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and\nwants a snug little cottage.’ ’Go home, then,’ said the fish; ’she is\nin the cottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife\nstanding at the door of a nice trim little cottage. ’Come in, come\nin!’ said she; ’is not this much better than the filthy pigsty we\nhad?’ And there was a parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and\nbehind the cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts\nof flowers and fruits; and there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks\nand chickens. ’Ah!’ said the fisherman, ’how happily we shall live\nnow!’ ’We will try to do so, at least,’ said his wife.",
        "Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,\n’Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the\ncourtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to\nhave a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell\nhim to give us a castle.’ ’Wife,’ said the fisherman, ’I don’t like to\ngo to him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy\nwith this pretty cottage to live in.’ ’Nonsense!’ said the wife; ’he\nwill do it very willingly, I know; go along and try!’",
        "The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to\nthe sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he\nwent close to the edge of the waves, and said:",
        " ’O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’",
        "’Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish. ’Ah!’ said the man,\ndolefully, ’my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ’Go home, then,’\nsaid the fish; ’she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away\nwent the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a\ngreat castle. ’See,’ said she, ’is not this grand?’ With that they\nwent into the castle together, and found a great many servants there,\nand the rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and\ntables; and behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park\nhalf a mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and\nin the courtyard were stables and cow-houses. ’Well,’ said the man,\n’now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the\nrest of our lives.’ ’Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ’but let us sleep\nupon it, before we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed.",
        "The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and\nshe jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ’Get up, husband,\nand bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ’Wife,\nwife,’ said the man, ’why should we wish to be the king? I will not be\nking.’ ’Then I will,’ said she. ’But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ’how\ncan you be king–the fish cannot make you a king?’ ’Husband,’ said\nshe, ’say no more about it, but go and try! I will be king.’ So the\nman went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be\nking. This time the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread\nwith curling waves and the ridges of foam as he cried out:",
        " ’O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’",
        "’Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish. ’Alas!’ said the poor\nman, ’my wife wants to be king.’ ’Go home,’ said the fish; ’she is\nking already.’",
        "Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he\nsaw a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets.\nAnd when he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and\ndiamonds, with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her\nstood six fair maidens, each a head taller than the other. ’Well,\nwife,’ said the fisherman, ’are you king?’ ’Yes,’ said she, ’I am\nking.’ And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, ’Ah,\nwife! what a fine thing it is to be king! Now we shall never have\nanything more to wish for as long as we live.’ ’I don’t know how that\nmay be,’ said she; ’never is a long time. I am king, it is true; but I\nbegin to be tired of that, and I think I should like to be emperor.’\n’Alas, wife! why should you wish to be emperor?’ said the fisherman.\n’Husband,’ said she, ’go to the fish! I say I will be emperor.’ ’Ah,\nwife!’ replied the fisherman, ’the fish cannot make an emperor, I am\nsure, and I should not like to ask him for such a thing.’ ’I am king,’\nsaid Ilsabill, ’and you are my slave; so go at once!’",
        "So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,\n’This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be\ntired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He\nsoon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy,\nand a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but\nhe went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:",
        " ’O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’",
        "’What would she have now?’ said the fish. ’Ah!’ said the fisherman,\n’she wants to be emperor.’ ’Go home,’ said the fish; ’she is emperor\nalready.’",
        "So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill\nsitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown\non her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her\nguards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from\nthe tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And\nbefore her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went\nup to her and said, ’Wife, are you emperor?’ ’Yes,’ said she, ’I am\nemperor.’ ’Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ’what a fine thing\nit is to be emperor!’ ’Husband,’ said she, ’why should we stop at\nbeing emperor? I will be pope next.’ ’O wife, wife!’ said he, ’how can\nyou be pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’\n’Husband,’ said she, ’I will be pope this very day.’ ’But,’ replied\nthe husband, ’the fish cannot make you pope.’ ’What nonsense!’ said\nshe; ’if he can make an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’",
        "So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was\nraging and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the\nships were in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the\nbillows. In the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue\nsky, but towards the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was\nrising. At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he\ntrembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down\nnear to the shore, and said:",
        " ’O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’",
        "’What does she want now?’ said the fish. ’Ah!’ said the fisherman, ’my\nwife wants to be pope.’ ’Go home,’ said the fish; ’she is pope\nalready.’",
        "Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne\nthat was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head,\nand around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each\nside of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the\ngreatest as large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and\nthe least no larger than a small rushlight. ’Wife,’ said the\nfisherman, as he looked at all this greatness, ’are you pope?’ ’Yes,’\nsaid she, ’I am pope.’ ’Well, wife,’ replied he, ’it is a grand thing\nto be pope; and now you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’\n’I will think about that,’ said the wife. Then they went to bed: but\nDame Ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should\nbe next. At last, as she was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the\nsun rose. ’Ha!’ thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through\nthe window, ’after all I cannot prevent the sun rising.’ At this\nthought she was very angry, and wakened her husband, and said,\n’Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must be lord of the sun and\nmoon.’ The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him\nso much that he started and fell out of bed. ’Alas, wife!’ said he,\n’cannot you be easy with being pope?’ ’No,’ said she, ’I am very\nuneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my leave. Go to the\nfish at once!’",
        "Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the\nshore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks\nshook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the\nlightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in\nthe sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of\nwhite foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,\nand cried out, as well as he could:",
        " ’O man of the sea!\n  Hearken to me!\n  My wife Ilsabill\n  Will have her own will,\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’",
        "’What does she want now?’ said the fish. ’Ah!’ said he, ’she wants to\nbe lord of the sun and moon.’ ’Go home,’ said the fish, ’to your\npigsty again.’",
        "And there they live to this very day.",
        "Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,\nand the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said:\n’Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ’That is the King\nof birds,’ said the wolf, ’before whom we must bow down.’ In reality\nthe bird was the willow-wren. ’IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ’I\nshould very much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’\n’That is not done quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ’you\nmust wait until the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived\nwith some food in her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began\nto feed their young ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but\nthe wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said: ’No, you must wait\nuntil the lord and lady Queen have gone away again.’ So they took\nstock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away. The bear,\nhowever, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and when a\nshort time had passed, went to it again. The King and Queen had just\nflown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying there.\n’Is that the royal palace?’ cried the bear; ’it is a wretched palace,\nand you are not King’s children, you are disreputable children!’ When\nthe young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and screamed:\n’No, that we are not! Our parents are honest people! Bear, you will\nhave to pay for that!’",
        "The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\nholes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream,\nand when their parents again brought food they said: ’We will not so\nmuch as touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until\nyou have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear\nhas been here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ’Be easy,\nhe shall be punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the\nbear’s cave, and called in: ’Old Growler, why have you insulted my\nchildren? You shall suffer for it–we will punish you by a bloody\nwar.’ Thus war was announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals\nwere summoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every\nother animal the earth contained. And the willow-wren summoned\neverything which flew in the air, not only birds, large and small, but\nmidges, and hornets, bees and flies had to come.",
        "When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out\nspies to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat,\nwho was the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was\nassembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the\npassword was to be announced. There stood the bear, and he called the\nfox before him and said: ’Fox, you are the most cunning of all\nanimals, you shall be general and lead us.’ ’Good,’ said the fox, ’but\nwhat signal shall we agree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said:\n’I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red\nfeathers. When I lift my tail up quite high, all is going well, and\nyou must charge; but if I let it hang down, run away as fast as you\ncan.’ When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and revealed\neverything, down to the minutest detail, to the willow-wren. When day\nbroke, and the battle was to begin, all the four-footed animals came\nrunning up with such a noise that the earth trembled. The willow-wren\nwith his army also came flying through the air with such a humming,\nand whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and\non both sides they advanced against each other. But the willow-wren\nsent down the hornet, with orders to settle beneath the fox’s tail,\nand sting with all his might. When the fox felt the first string, he\nstarted so that he one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and\nstill kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was\nforced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no\nlonger, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When the animals\nsaw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each into his\nhole, and the birds had won the battle.",
        "Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:\n’Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won\nthe battle!’ But the young wrens said: ’We will not eat yet, the bear\nmust come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are\nhonourable children, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren\nflew to the bear’s hole and cried: ’Growler, you are to come to the\nnest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your\nbody shall be broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear,\nand begged their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were\nsatisfied, and sat down together and ate and drank, and made merry\ntill quite late into the night.",
        "One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and\nwent out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a\ncool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself\ndown to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was\nher favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the\nair, and catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so\nhigh that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded\naway, and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into\nthe spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it\nwas very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then\nshe began to bewail her loss, and said, ’Alas! if I could only get my\nball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and\neverything that I have in the world.’",
        "Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and\nsaid, ’Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ’Alas!’ said she, ’what\ncan you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the\nspring.’ The frog said, ’I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine\nclothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat\nfrom off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you\nyour ball again.’ ’What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ’this silly\nfrog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me,\nthough he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell\nhim he shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ’Well, if\nyou will bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put\nhis head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little\nwhile he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on\nthe edge of the spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball,\nshe ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand\nagain, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as\nfast as she could. The frog called after her, ’Stay, princess, and\ntake me with you as you said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.",
        "The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\nstrange noise–tap, tap–plash, plash–as if something was coming up\nthe marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at\nthe door, and a little voice cried out and said:",
        " ’Open the door, my princess dear,\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’",
        "Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the\nfrog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly\nfrightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to\nher seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened\nher, asked her what was the matter. ’There is a nasty frog,’ said she,\n’at the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this\nmorning: I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he\ncould never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he\nwants to come in.’",
        "While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:",
        " ’Open the door, my princess dear,\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’",
        "Then the king said to the young princess, ’As you have given your word\nyou must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog\nhopped into the room, and then straight on–tap, tap–plash, plash–\nfrom the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the\ntable where the princess sat. ’Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to\nthe princess, ’and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done\nthis, the frog said, ’Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out\nof it.’ This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he\nsaid, ’Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’\nAnd the princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and\nput him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long.\nAs soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out\nof the house. ’Now, then,’ thought the princess, ’at last he is gone,\nand I shall be troubled with him no more.’",
        "But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same\ntapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:",
        " ’Open the door, my princess dear,\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’",
        "And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon\nher pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he\ndid the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she\nwas astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing\non her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at\nthe head of her bed.",
        "He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\nchanged him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till\nsome princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from\nher plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ’You,’ said the\nprince, ’have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish\nfor but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I\nwill marry you, and love you as long as you live.’",
        "The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ’Yes’ to\nall this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful\nhorses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and\nbehind the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had\nbewailed the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so\nlong and so bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.",
        "They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\nhorses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s\nkingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a\ngreat many years.",
        "A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so\nmuch to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that\nat length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house\ntogether. ’But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall\nsuffer from hunger,’ said the cat; ’and you, little mouse, cannot\nventure everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The\ngood advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did\nnot know where to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat\nsaid: ’I know no place where it will be better stored up than in the\nchurch, for no one dares take anything away from there. We will set it\nbeneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of\nit.’ So the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the\ncat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ’I want to\ntell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son\ninto the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with\nbrown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening.\nLet me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.’ ’Yes,\nyes,’ answered the mouse, ’by all means go, and if you get anything\nvery good to eat, think of me. I should like a drop of sweet red\nchristening wine myself.’ All this, however, was untrue; the cat had\nno cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother. She went straight\nto the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and\nlicked the top of the fat off. Then she took a walk upon the roofs of\nthe town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in\nthe sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat,\nand not until it was evening did she return home. ’Well, here you are\nagain,’ said the mouse, ’no doubt you have had a merry day.’ ’All went\noff well,’ answered the cat. ’What name did they give the child?’ ’Top\noff!’ said the cat quite coolly. ’Top off!’ cried the mouse, ’that is\na very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?’ ’What\ndoes that matter,’ said the cat, ’it is no worse than Crumb-stealer,\nas your godchildren are called.’",
        "Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to\nthe mouse: ’You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house\nfor a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child\nhas a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse\nconsented, but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and\ndevoured half the pot of fat. ’Nothing ever seems so good as what one\nkeeps to oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s\nwork. When she went home the mouse inquired: ’And what was the child\nchristened?’ ’Half-done,’ answered the cat. ’Half-done! What are you\nsaying? I never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is\nnot in the calendar!’",
        "The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ’All good\nthings go in threes,’ said she, ’I am asked to stand godmother again.\nThe child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that\nexception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only\nhappens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ’Top-\noff! Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ’they are such odd names, they\nmake me very thoughtful.’ ’You sit at home,’ said the cat, ’in your\ndark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s\nbecause you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence\nthe mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat\nentirely emptied the pot of fat. ’When everything is eaten up one has\nsome peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not\nreturn home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been\ngiven to the third child. ’It will not please you more than the\nothers,’ said the cat. ’He is called All-gone.’ ’All-gone,’ cried the\nmouse ’that is the most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it\nin print. All-gone; what can that mean?’ and she shook her head,\ncurled herself up, and lay down to sleep.",
        "From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when\nthe winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found\noutside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ’Come, cat,\nwe will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves–we\nshall enjoy that.’ ’Yes,’ answered the cat, ’you will enjoy it as much\nas you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the\nwindow.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of\nfat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ’Alas!’ said\nthe mouse, ’now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You a\ntrue friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother.\nFirst top off, then half-done, then–’ ’Will you hold your tongue,’\ncried the cat, ’one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ’All-gone’ was\nalready on the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before\nthe cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily,\nthat is the way of the world.",
        "The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of\ntheir only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful;\nand her mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there\nwas a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her\nmother to watch over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a\nprince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to\nbe married, she got ready to set off on her journey to his country.\nThen the queen her mother, packed up a great many costly things;\njewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short\neverything that became a royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid\nto ride with her, and give her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each\nhad a horse for the journey. Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s\ngift, and it was called Falada, and could speak.",
        "When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her bed-\nchamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and\ngave it to the princess, and said, ’Take care of it, dear child; for\nit is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all\ntook a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair\ninto her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her\nbridegroom’s kingdom.",
        "One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to\nfeel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ’Pray get down, and fetch\nme some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to\ndrink.’ ’Nay,’ said the maid, ’if you are thirsty, get off yourself,\nand stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-\nmaid any longer.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt\nover the little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared\nnot bring out her golden cup; and she wept and said, ’Alas! what will\nbecome of me?’ And the lock answered her, and said:",
        " ’Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’",
        "But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\nmaid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.",
        "Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and\nthe sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;\nand at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude\nspeech, and said, ’Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in\nmy golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more\nhaughtily than before: ’Drink if you will, but I shall not be your\nwaiting-maid.’ Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her\nhorse, and lay down, and held her head over the running stream, and\ncried and said, ’What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair\nanswered her again:",
        " ’Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’",
        "And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,\nand floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she\ndid not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew\nthe charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now\nthat she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and\nwould have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ’I shall ride upon\nFalada, and you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give\nup her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and\nput on her maid’s shabby ones.",
        "At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\nservant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what\nhad happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.",
        "Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon\nthe other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came\nto the royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the\nprince flew to meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking\nshe was the one who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to\nthe royal chamber; but the true princess was told to stay in the court\nbelow.",
        "Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\namused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was\ngoing on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,\nand too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber\nto ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus\nleft standing in the court below. ’I brought her with me for the sake\nof her company on the road,’ said she; ’pray give the girl some work\nto do, that she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time\nthink of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ’I have a lad\nwho takes care of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of\nthis lad, that the real bride was to help in watching the king’s\ngeese, was Curdken.",
        "But the false bride said to the prince, ’Dear husband, pray do me one\npiece of kindness.’ ’That I will,’ said the prince. ’Then tell one of\nyour slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it\nwas very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was,\nshe was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak,\nand tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and\nthe faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of\nit, she wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a\nlarge dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every\nmorning and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes.\nThen the slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the\nhead, and nailed it up under the dark gate.",
        "Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,\nshe said sorrowfully:",
        " ’Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’",
        "and the head answered:",
        " ’Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’",
        "Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she\ncame to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her\nwaving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken\nsaw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of\nthe locks out, but she cried:",
        " ’Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let him after it go!\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\n  Away be it whirl’d\n  Till the silvery locks\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!",
        "Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and\naway it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after\nit; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling\nher hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and\nsulky, and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese\nuntil it grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.",
        "The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor\ngirl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:",
        " ’Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’",
        "and the head answered:",
        " ’Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\n  Alas! alas! if they mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’",
        "Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and\nbegan to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and\nwanted to take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:",
        " ’Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let him after it go!\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\n  Away be it whirl’d\n  Till the silvery locks\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!",
        "Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,\nover the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when\nhe came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So\nthey watched the geese till it grew dark.",
        "In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king,\nand said, ’I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the\ngeese any longer.’ ’Why?’ said the king. ’Because, instead of doing\nany good, she does nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king\nmade him tell him what had happened. And Curdken said, ’When we go in\nthe morning through the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries\nand talks with the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:",
        " ’Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’",
        "and the head answers:",
        " ’Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\n  Alas! alas! if they mother knew it,\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’",
        "And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow\nwhere the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced\nto run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But\nthe old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when\nmorning came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how\nshe spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the\nfield, and hid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw\nwith his own eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a\nlittle time, she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then\nhe heard her say:",
        " ’Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\n  Let him after it go!\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\n  Away be it whirl’d\n  Till the silvery locks\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!",
        "And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away\nwent Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her\nhair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen;\nand when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her\naside, and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and\nsaid, ’That I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’",
        "But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had\ntold him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it\nwas very lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king\nordered royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with\nwonder, she was so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that\nhe had only a false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid,\nwhile the true bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw\nher beauty, and heard how meek and patient she had been; and without\nsaying anything to the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to\nbe got ready for all his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with\nthe false princess on one side, and the true one on the other; but\nnobody knew her again, for her beauty was quite dazzling to their\neyes; and she did not seem at all like the little goose-girl, now that\nshe had her brilliant dress on.",
        "When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said\nhe would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the\nprincess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the\ntrue waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who\nwould behave thus. ’Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ’than that\nshe should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and\nthat two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from\nstreet to street till she was dead.’ ’Thou art she!’ said the old\nking; ’and as thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’\nAnd the young king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned\nover the kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good\nfairy came to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life\nagain.",
        "’The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\n’suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\nbefore the squirrel takes them all away.’ ’With all my heart,’ said\nPartlet, ’let us go and make a holiday of it together.’",
        "So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\nthere till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so\nmany nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and\nwould not, I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that\nit did not become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to\nbuild a little carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished,\nPartlet jumped into it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness\nhimself to it and draw her home. ’That’s a good joke!’ said\nChanticleer; ’no, that will never do; I had rather by half walk home;\nI’ll sit on the box and be coachman, if you like, but I’ll not draw.’\nWhile this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, ’You\nthieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds? I’ll give it\nyou well for your insolence!’ and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer\nmost lustily. But Chanticleer was no coward, and returned the duck’s\nblows with his sharp spurs so fiercely that she soon began to cry out\nfor mercy; which was only granted her upon condition that she would\ndraw the carriage home for them. This she agreed to do; and\nChanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ’Now, duck, get on as\nfast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good pace.",
        "After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a\npin walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ’Stop,\nstop!’ and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way,\nand such dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that\nhe and his friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles\noff, and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he\nbegged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them\na lift in their carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but\nthin fellows, and not likely to take up much room, told them they\nmight ride, but made them promise not to dirty the wheels of the\ncarriage in getting in, nor to tread on Partlet’s toes.",
        "Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in\nthe dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good\ndeal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their\nquarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his\nhouse was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:\nhowever, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet\nhad laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in\nthe habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and\nthey bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.",
        "Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\nstirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the\negg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into\nthe fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast\nasleep, and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s\neasy chair and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this,\nthey crept away as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in\nthe open air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the\nbrook which ran close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.",
        "An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his\nhandkerchief to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked\nhim: then he walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire,\nbut when he stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost\nblinded him. ’Bless me!’ said he, ’all the world seems to have a\ndesign against my head this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself\nsulkily into his easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him;\nand this time the pain was not in his head. He now flew into a very\ngreat passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night\nbefore, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore\nthat he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a\ngreat deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble\nbut their apish tricks.",
        "Another day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together; so\nChanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\nharnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the\ncarriage, and away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and\nsaid, ’Where are you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,",
        " ’All on our way\n  A visit to pay\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’",
        "Then the cat said, ’Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ’With all my\nheart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’",
        " ’Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\n  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!\n  Now, mice, be ready,\n  And, wheels, run steady!\n  For we are going a visit to pay\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’",
        "Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and\nChanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with\nthem.",
        "When they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the\nmice drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet\nflew upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\nthe washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\nmillstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\nup in the towel.",
        "When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\nthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\nwash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face;\nand when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the\ntowel all over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went\nwithout his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow,\nthe pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and,\njumping up, would have run out of the house; but when he came to the\ndoor, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on the spot.",
        "Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the\nmountains to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they\nfound should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very\nlarge nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it\nall to herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it,\nand it stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried\nout to Chanticleer, ’Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some\nwater, or I shall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to\nthe river, and said, ’River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in\nthe mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ’Run\nfirst to the bride, and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the\nwater.’ Chanticleer ran to the bride, and said, ’Bride, you must give\nme a silken cord, for then the river will give me water, and the water\nI will carry to Partlet, who lies on the mountain, and will be choked\nby a great nut.’ But the bride said, ’Run first, and bring me my\ngarland that is hanging on a willow in the garden.’ Then Chanticleer\nran to the garden, and took the garland from the bough where it hung,\nand brought it to the bride; and then the bride gave him the silken\ncord, and he took the silken cord to the river, and the river gave him\nwater, and he carried the water to Partlet; but in the meantime she\nwas choked by the great nut, and lay quite dead, and never moved any\nmore.",
        "Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the\nbeasts came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a\nlittle hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they\nharnessed themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way\nthey met the fox. ’Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he. ’To\nbury my Partlet,’ said the other. ’May I go with you?’ said the fox.\n’Yes; but you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to\ndraw you.’ Then the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the\nbear, the goat, and all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon\nthe hearse.",
        "So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ’How shall we get\nover?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ’I will lay myself across,\nand you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the\nstraw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell\nin and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood\ncame and said, ’I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream,\nand you shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they\nmanaged so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away\nby the stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and\nkindly offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the\nstream; and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse,\nand managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other\nmourners, who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into\nthe water and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.",
        "Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug\na grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over\nher. Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last\nhe died too; and so all were dead.",
        "There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a\nchild. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her\ndesire. These people had a little window at the back of their house\nfrom which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most\nbeautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high\nwall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an\nenchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. One\nday the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the\ngarden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful\nrampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed\nfor it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.\nThen her husband was alarmed, and asked: ’What ails you, dear wife?’\n’Ah,’ she replied, ’if I can’t eat some of the rampion, which is in\nthe garden behind our house, I shall die.’ The man, who loved her,\nthought: ’Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion\nyourself, let it cost what it will.’ At twilight, he clambered down\nover the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a\nhandful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself\na salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her–so very\ngood, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as\nbefore. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend\ninto the garden. In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself\ndown again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly\nafraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him. ’How can you\ndare,’ said she with angry look, ’descend into my garden and steal my\nrampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’ ’Ah,’ answered he,\n’let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it\nout of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt\nsuch a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some\nto eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and\nsaid to him: ’If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away\nwith you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you\nmust give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it\nshall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.’ The man\nin his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought\nto bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of\nRapunzel, and took it away with her.",
        "Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she\nwas twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay\nin a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was\na little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed\nherself beneath it and cried:",
        " ’Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n  Let down your hair to me.’",
        "Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she\nheard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,\nwound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the\nhair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.",
        "After a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through\nthe forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so\ncharming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in\nher solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The\nking’s son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the\ntower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so\ndeeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest\nand listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he\nsaw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:",
        " ’Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n  Let down your hair to me.’",
        "Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress\nclimbed up to her. ’If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too\nwill try my fortune,’ said he, and the next day when it began to grow\ndark, he went to the tower and cried:",
        " ’Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n  Let down your hair to me.’",
        "Immediately the hair fell down and the king’s son climbed up.",
        "At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes\nhad never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’s son began to talk to\nher quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so\nstirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to\nsee her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she\nwould take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and\nhandsome, she thought: ’He will love me more than old Dame Gothel\ndoes’; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said: ’I will\nwillingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring\nwith you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a\nladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will\ntake me on your horse.’ They agreed that until that time he should\ncome to her every evening, for the old woman came by day. The\nenchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her:\n’Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for\nme to draw up than the young king’s son–he is with me in a moment.’\n’Ah! you wicked child,’ cried the enchantress. ’What do I hear you\nsay! I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you\nhave deceived me!’ In her anger she clutched Rapunzel’s beautiful\ntresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of\nscissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the\nlovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she took\npoor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and\nmisery.",
        "On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress\nfastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the\nwindow, and when the king’s son came and cried:",
        " ’Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\n  Let down your hair to me.’",
        "she let the hair down. The king’s son ascended, but instead of finding\nhis dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with\nwicked and venomous looks. ’Aha!’ she cried mockingly, ’you would\nfetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in\nthe nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well.\nRapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again.’ The king’s son\nwas beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from\nthe tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell\npierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate\nnothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over\nthe loss of his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some\nyears, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins\nto which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.\nHe heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went\ntowards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his\nneck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear\nagain, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom\nwhere he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time\nafterwards, happy and contented.",
        "There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as he\nentered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were\nthere. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at\nthe top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen\nasleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it\nin her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high\ntree.",
        "The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to\nhimself: ’You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your\nLina.’ He took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up\ntogether. And the one, which he had found on a tree was called\nFundevogel, because a bird had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina\nloved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they\nwere sad.",
        "Now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and\nbegan to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out to\nthe spring. Lina saw this and said, ’Listen, old Sanna, why are you\nfetching so much water?’ ’If you will never repeat it to anyone, I\nwill tell you why.’ So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to\nanyone, and then the cook said: ’Early tomorrow morning, when the\nforester is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling\nin the kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.’",
        "Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when\nhe was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to\nFundevogel: ’If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.’\nFundevogel said: ’Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.’ Then said\nLina: ’Then will I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many\nbuckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing\nthat, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she\nsaid that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she\nwould set the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you;\nbut we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.’",
        "The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and\nwent away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went\ninto the bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when\nshe came in, and went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then\nshe was terribly alarmed, and she said to herself: ’What shall I say\nnow when the forester comes home and sees that the children are gone?\nThey must be followed instantly to get them back again.’",
        "Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\novertake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the\nforest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina\nsaid to Fundevogel: ’Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’\nFundevogel said: ’Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ’Do you\nbecome a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants\ncame to the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on\nit, but the children were nowhere. Then said they: ’There is nothing\nto be done here,’ and they went home and told the cook that they had\nseen nothing in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it.\nThen the old cook scolded and said: ’You simpletons, you should have\ncut the rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it\nhome with you; go, and do it at once.’ They had therefore to go out\nand look for the second time. The children, however, saw them coming\nfrom a distance. Then Lina said: ’Fundevogel, never leave me, and I\nwill never leave you.’ Fundevogel said: ’Neither now; nor ever.’ Said\nLina: ’Then do you become a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in it.’\nSo when the three servants came, nothing was there but a church, with\na chandelier in it. They said therefore to each other: ’What can we do\nhere, let us go home.’ When they got home, the cook asked if they had\nnot found them; so they said no, they had found nothing but a church,\nand there was a chandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said:\n’You fools! why did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the\nchandelier home with you?’ And now the old cook herself got on her\nlegs, and went with the three servants in pursuit of the children. The\nchildren, however, saw from afar that the three servants were coming,\nand the cook waddling after them. Then said Lina: ’Fundevogel, never\nleave me, and I will never leave you.’ Then said Fundevogel: ’Neither\nnow, nor ever.’ Said Lina: ’Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon\nit.’ The cook, however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she\nlay down by it, and was about to drink it up. But the duck swam\nquickly to her, seized her head in its beak and drew her into the\nwater, and there the old witch had to drown. Then the children went\nhome together, and were heartily delighted, and if they have not died,\nthey are living still.",
        "One summer’s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the\nwindow; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then\ncame a peasant woman down the street crying: ’Good jams, cheap! Good\njams, cheap!’ This rang pleasantly in the tailor’s ears; he stretched\nhis delicate head out of the window, and called: ’Come up here, dear\nwoman; here you will get rid of your goods.’ The woman came up the\nthree steps to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her\nunpack all the pots for him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put\nhis nose to it, and at length said: ’The jam seems to me to be good,\nso weigh me out four ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a\npound that is of no consequence.’ The woman who had hoped to find a\ngood sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry and\ngrumbling. ’Now, this jam shall be blessed by God,’ cried the little\ntailor, ’and give me health and strength’; so he brought the bread out\nof the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread\nthe jam over it. ’This won’t taste bitter,’ said he, ’but I will just\nfinish the jacket before I take a bite.’ He laid the bread near him,\nsewed on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches. In the\nmeantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were\nsitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it\nin hosts. ’Hi! who invited you?’ said the little tailor, and drove the\nunbidden guests away. The flies, however, who understood no German,\nwould not be turned away, but came back again in ever-increasing\ncompanies. The little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a\npiece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, and saying: ’Wait,\nand I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on them. When he\ndrew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer than seven,\ndead and with legs stretched out. ’Are you a fellow of that sort?’\nsaid he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. ’The whole town\nshall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself a\ngirdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ’Seven at\none stroke!’ ’What, the town!’ he continued, ’the whole world shall\nhear of it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail. The\ntailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world,\nbecause he thought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before\nhe went away, he sought about in the house to see if there was\nanything which he could take with him; however, he found nothing but\nan old cheese, and that he put in his pocket. In front of the door he\nobserved a bird which had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go\ninto his pocket with the cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and\nas he was light and nimble, he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a\nmountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a\npowerful giant looking peacefully about him. The little tailor went\nbravely up, spoke to him, and said: ’Good day, comrade, so you are\nsitting there overlooking the wide-spread world! I am just on my way\nthither, and want to try my luck. Have you any inclination to go with\nme?’ The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said: ’You\nragamuffin! You miserable creature!’",
        "’Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\nshowed the giant the girdle, ’there may you read what kind of a man I\nam!’ The giant read: ’Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had\nbeen men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little\nrespect for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first,\nand took a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water\ndropped out of it. ’Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ’if you have\nstrength.’ ’Is that all?’ said the tailor, ’that is child’s play with\nus!’ and put his hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese,\nand pressed it until the liquid ran out of it. ’Faith,’ said he, ’that\nwas a little better, wasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say,\nand could not believe it of the little man. Then the giant picked up a\nstone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it.\n’Now, little mite of a man, do that likewise,’ ’Well thrown,’ said the\ntailor, ’but after all the stone came down to earth again; I will\nthrow you one which shall never come back at all,’ and he put his hand\ninto his pocket, took out the bird, and threw it into the air. The\nbird, delighted with its liberty, rose, flew away and did not come\nback. ’How does that shot please you, comrade?’ asked the tailor. ’You\ncan certainly throw,’ said the giant, ’but now we will see if you are\nable to carry anything properly.’ He took the little tailor to a\nmighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said: ’If\nyou are strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the forest.’\n’Readily,’ answered the little man; ’take you the trunk on your\nshoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs; after all, they\nare the heaviest.’ The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the\ntailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not look\nround, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into\nthe bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the\nsong: ’Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if carrying the\ntree were child’s play. The giant, after he had dragged the heavy\nburden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ’Hark you, I\nshall have to let the tree fall!’ The tailor sprang nimbly down,\nseized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said\nto the giant: ’You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\nthe tree!’",
        "They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant\nlaid hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging,\nbent it down, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat. But\nthe little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the\ngiant let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into\nthe air with it. When he had fallen down again without injury, the\ngiant said: ’What is this? Have you not strength enough to hold the\nweak twig?’ ’There is no lack of strength,’ answered the little\ntailor. ’Do you think that could be anything to a man who has struck\ndown seven at one blow? I leapt over the tree because the huntsmen are\nshooting down there in the thicket. Jump as I did, if you can do it.’\nThe giant made the attempt but he could not get over the tree, and\nremained hanging in the branches, so that in this also the tailor kept\nthe upper hand.",
        "The giant said: ’If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into\nour cavern and spend the night with us.’ The little tailor was\nwilling, and followed him. When they went into the cave, other giants\nwere sitting there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep\nin his hand and was eating it. The little tailor looked round and\nthought: ’It is much more spacious here than in my workshop.’ The\ngiant showed him a bed, and said he was to lie down in it and sleep.\nThe bed, however, was too big for the little tailor; he did not lie\ndown in it, but crept into a corner. When it was midnight, and the\ngiant thought that the little tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he\ngot up, took a great iron bar, cut through the bed with one blow, and\nthought he had finished off the grasshopper for good. With the\nearliest dawn the giants went into the forest, and had quite forgotten\nthe little tailor, when all at once he walked up to them quite merrily\nand boldly. The giants were terrified, they were afraid that he would\nstrike them all dead, and ran away in a great hurry.",
        "The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.\nAfter he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a\nroyal palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell\nasleep. Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all\nsides, and read on his girdle: ’Seven at one stroke.’ ’Ah!’ said they,\n’what does the great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must\nbe a mighty lord.’ They went and announced him to the king, and gave\nit as their opinion that if war should break out, this would be a\nweighty and useful man who ought on no account to be allowed to\ndepart. The counsel pleased the king, and he sent one of his courtiers\nto the little tailor to offer him military service when he awoke. The\nambassador remained standing by the sleeper, waited until he stretched\nhis limbs and opened his eyes, and then conveyed to him this proposal.\n’For this very reason have I come here,’ the tailor replied, ’I am\nready to enter the king’s service.’ He was therefore honourably\nreceived, and a special dwelling was assigned him.",
        "The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished\nhim a thousand miles away. ’What is to be the end of this?’ they said\namong themselves. ’If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,\nseven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against\nhim.’ They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body\nto the king, and begged for their dismissal. ’We are not prepared,’\nsaid they, ’to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’ The\nking was sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his\nfaithful servants, wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor,\nand would willingly have been rid of him again. But he did not venture\nto give him his dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him\nand all his people dead, and place himself on the royal throne. He\nthought about it for a long time, and at last found good counsel. He\nsent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed that as he was\na great warrior, he had one request to make to him. In a forest of his\ncountry lived two giants, who caused great mischief with their\nrobbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and no one could approach\nthem without putting himself in danger of death. If the tailor\nconquered and killed these two giants, he would give him his only\ndaughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a dowry, likewise one\nhundred horsemen should go with him to assist him. ’That would indeed\nbe a fine thing for a man like me!’ thought the little tailor. ’One is\nnot offered a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of one’s\nlife!’ ’Oh, yes,’ he replied, ’I will soon subdue the giants, and do\nnot require the help of the hundred horsemen to do it; he who can hit\nseven with one blow has no need to be afraid of two.’",
        "The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.\nWhen he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:\n’Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.’\nThen he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After\na while he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and\nsnored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not\nidle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the\ntree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he\nsat just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall\non the breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt\nnothing, but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ’Why are\nyou knocking me?’ ’You must be dreaming,’ said the other, ’I am not\nknocking you.’ They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the\ntailor threw a stone down on the second. ’What is the meaning of\nthis?’ cried the other ’Why are you pelting me?’ ’I am not pelting\nyou,’ answered the first, growling. They disputed about it for a time,\nbut as they were weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed\nonce more. The little tailor began his game again, picked out the\nbiggest stone, and threw it with all his might on the breast of the\nfirst giant. ’That is too bad!’ cried he, and sprang up like a madman,\nand pushed his companion against the tree until it shook. The other\npaid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that\nthey tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last\nthey both fell down dead on the ground at the same time. Then the\nlittle tailor leapt down. ’It is a lucky thing,’ said he, ’that they\ndid not tear up the tree on which I was sitting, or I should have had\nto sprint on to another like a squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’\nHe drew out his sword and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the\nbreast, and then went out to the horsemen and said: ’The work is done;\nI have finished both of them off, but it was hard work! They tore up\ntrees in their sore need, and defended themselves with them, but all\nthat is to no purpose when a man like myself comes, who can kill seven\nat one blow.’ ’But are you not wounded?’ asked the horsemen. ’You need\nnot concern yourself about that,’ answered the tailor, ’they have not\nbent one hair of mine.’ The horsemen would not believe him, and rode\ninto the forest; there they found the giants swimming in their blood,\nand all round about lay the torn-up trees.",
        "The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he,\nhowever, repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he\ncould get rid of the hero. ’Before you receive my daughter, and the\nhalf of my kingdom,’ said he to him, ’you must perform one more heroic\ndeed. In the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you\nmust catch it first.’ ’I fear one unicorn still less than two giants.\nSeven at one blow, is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope and an axe\nwith him, went forth into the forest, and again bade those who were\nsent with him to wait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn\nsoon came towards him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it\nwould gore him with its horn without more ado. ’Softly, softly; it\ncan’t be done as quickly as that,’ said he, and stood still and waited\nuntil the animal was quite close, and then sprang nimbly behind the\ntree. The unicorn ran against the tree with all its strength, and\nstuck its horn so fast in the trunk that it had not the strength\nenough to draw it out again, and thus it was caught. ’Now, I have got\nthe bird,’ said the tailor, and came out from behind the tree and put\nthe rope round its neck, and then with his axe he hewed the horn out\nof the tree, and when all was ready he led the beast away and took it\nto the king.",
        "The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a\nthird demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild\nboar that made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give\nhim their help. ’Willingly,’ said the tailor, ’that is child’s play!’\nHe did not take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were\nwell pleased that he did not, for the wild boar had several times\nreceived them in such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in\nwait for him. When the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with\nfoaming mouth and whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the\nground, but the hero fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and\nup to the window at once, and in one bound out again. The boar ran\nafter him, but the tailor ran round outside and shut the door behind\nit, and then the raging beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to\nleap out of the window, was caught. The little tailor called the\nhuntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes.\nThe hero, however, went to the king, who was now, whether he liked it\nor not, obliged to keep his promise, and gave his daughter and the\nhalf of his kingdom. Had he known that it was no warlike hero, but a\nlittle tailor who was standing before him, it would have gone to his\nheart still more than it did. The wedding was held with great\nmagnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a king was made.",
        "After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at\nnight: ’Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I\nwill rap the yard-measure over your ears.’ Then she discovered in what\nstate of life the young lord had been born, and next morning\ncomplained of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to\nget rid of her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king\ncomforted her and said: ’Leave your bedroom door open this night, and\nmy servants shall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall\ngo in, bind him, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him\ninto the wide world.’ The woman was satisfied with this; but the\nking’s armour-bearer, who had heard all, was friendly with the young\nlord, and informed him of the whole plot. ’I’ll put a screw into that\nbusiness,’ said the little tailor. At night he went to bed with his\nwife at the usual time, and when she thought that he had fallen\nasleep, she got up, opened the door, and then lay down again. The\nlittle tailor, who was only pretending to be asleep, began to cry out\nin a clear voice: ’Boy, make me the doublet and patch me the\npantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your ears. I smote\nseven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one unicorn,\nand caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing\noutside the room.’ When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they\nwere overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were\nbehind them, and none of them would venture anything further against\nhim. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his\nlife.",
        "Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his\ntwo children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had\nlittle to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the\nland, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought\nover this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he\ngroaned and said to his wife: ’What is to become of us? How are we to\nfeed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for\nourselves?’ ’I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ’early\ntomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to\nwhere it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and\ngive each of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our\nwork and leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and\nwe shall be rid of them.’ ’No, wife,’ said the man, ’I will not do\nthat; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?–the\nwild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ’O, you fool!’\nsaid she, ’then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane\nthe planks for our coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he\nconsented. ’But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the\nsame,’ said the man.",
        "The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\nheard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept\nbitter tears, and said to Hansel: ’Now all is over with us.’ ’Be\nquiet, Gretel,’ said Hansel, ’do not distress yourself, I will soon\nfind a way to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he\ngot up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept\noutside. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in\nfront of the house glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped\nand stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get\nin. Then he went back and said to Gretel: ’Be comforted, dear little\nsister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down\nagain in his bed. When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the\nwoman came and awoke the two children, saying: ’Get up, you sluggards!\nwe are going into the forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little\npiece of bread, and said: ’There is something for your dinner, but do\nnot eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took\nthe bread under her apron, as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket.\nThen they all set out together on the way to the forest. When they had\nwalked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house,\nand did so again and again. His father said: ’Hansel, what are you\nlooking at there and staying behind for? Pay attention, and do not\nforget how to use your legs.’ ’Ah, father,’ said Hansel, ’I am looking\nat my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to\nsay goodbye to me.’ The wife said: ’Fool, that is not your little cat,\nthat is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel,\nhowever, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly\nthrowing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road.",
        "When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ’Now,\nchildren, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not\nbe cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a\nlittle hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were\nburning very high, the woman said: ’Now, children, lay yourselves down\nby the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood.\nWhen we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’",
        "Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a\nlittle piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe\nthey believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however,\nbut a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind\nwas blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such\na long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast\nasleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel\nbegan to cry and said: ’How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But\nHansel comforted her and said: ’Just wait a little, until the moon has\nrisen, and then we will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had\nrisen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the\npebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them\nthe way.",
        "They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more\nto their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman\nopened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ’You\nnaughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?–we\nthought you were never coming back at all!’ The father, however,\nrejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.",
        "Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the\nland, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their\nfather: ’Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and\nthat is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into\nthe wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no\nother means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he\nthought: ’It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with\nyour children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he\nhad to say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B,\nlikewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a\nsecond time also.",
        "The children, however, were still awake and had heard the\nconversation. When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and\nwanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the\nwoman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless\nhe comforted his little sister, and said: ’Do not cry, Gretel, go to\nsleep quietly, the good God will help us.’",
        "Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of\ntheir beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still\nsmaller than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel\ncrumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel\non the ground. ’Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the\nfather, ’go on.’ ’I am looking back at my little pigeon which is\nsitting on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel.\n’Fool!’ said the woman, ’that is not your little pigeon, that is the\nmorning sun that is shining on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by\nlittle, threw all the crumbs on the path.",
        "The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they\nhad never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again\nmade, and the mother said: ’Just sit there, you children, and when you\nare tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut\nwood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you\naway.’ When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel,\nwho had scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening\npassed, but no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until\nit was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said:\n’Just wait, Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the\ncrumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way\nhome again.’ When the moon came they set out, but they found no\ncrumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods\nand fields had picked them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ’We shall\nsoon find the way,’ but they did not find it. They walked the whole\nnight and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did\nnot get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing\nto eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground. And as they\nwere so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay\ndown beneath a tree and fell asleep.",
        "It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house.\nThey began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest,\nand if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness.\nWhen it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a\nbough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened\nto it. And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away\nbefore them, and they followed it until they reached a little house,\non the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little\nhouse they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but\nthat the windows were of clear sugar. ’We will set to work on that,’\nsaid Hansel, ’and have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and\nyou Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel\nreached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it\ntasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes.\nThen a soft voice cried from the parlour:",
        " ’Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\n  Who is nibbling at my little house?’",
        "The children answered:",
        " ’The wind, the wind,\n  The heaven-born wind,’",
        "and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked\nthe taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel\npushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed\nherself with it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the\nhills, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel\nand Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they\nhad in their hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said:\n’Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay\nwith me. No harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand,\nand led them into her little house. Then good food was set before\nthem, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two\npretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and\nGretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.",
        "The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a\nwicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\nlittle house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell\ninto her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast\nday with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have\na keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw\nnear. When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed\nwith malice, and said mockingly: ’I have them, they shall not escape\nme again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she\nwas already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so\npretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself:\n’That will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her\nshrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in\nbehind a grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then\nshe went to Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ’Get up, lazy\nthing, fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he\nis in the stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I\nwill eat him.’ Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain,\nfor she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.",
        "And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got\nnothing but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little\nstable, and cried: ’Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if\nyou will soon be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to\nher, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and\nthought it was Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no\nway of fattening him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still\nremained thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any\nlonger. ’Now, then, Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ’stir yourself,\nand bring some water. Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill\nhim, and cook him.’ Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she\nhad to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down her cheeks!\n’Dear God, do help us,’ she cried. ’If the wild beasts in the forest\nhad but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.’ ’Just\nkeep your noise to yourself,’ said the old woman, ’it won’t help you\nat all.’",
        "Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron\nwith the water, and light the fire. ’We will bake first,’ said the old\nwoman, ’I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She\npushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were\nalready darting. ’Creep in,’ said the witch, ’and see if it is\nproperly heated, so that we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was\ninside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then\nshe would eat her, too. But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said:\n’I do not know how I am to do it; how do I get in?’ ’Silly goose,’\nsaid the old woman. ’The door is big enough; just look, I can get in\nmyself!’ and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. Then\nGretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron\ndoor, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then she began to howl quite\nhorribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless witch was miserably\nburnt to death.",
        "Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little\nstable, and cried: ’Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then\nHansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How\nthey did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each\nother! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into\nthe witch’s house, and in every corner there stood chests full of\npearls and jewels. ’These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel,\nand thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said:\n’I, too, will take something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore\nfull. ’But now we must be off,’ said Hansel, ’that we may get out of\nthe witch’s forest.’",
        "When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of\nwater. ’We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ’I see no foot-plank, and no\nbridge.’ ’And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ’but a white\nduck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she\ncried:",
        " ’Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\n  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\n  There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,\n  Take us across on thy back so white.’",
        "The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told\nhis sister to sit by him. ’No,’ replied Gretel, ’that will be too\nheavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the\nother.’ The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely\nacross and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more\nand more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their\nfather’s house. Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and\nthrew themselves round their father’s neck. The man had not known one\nhappy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman,\nhowever, was dead. Gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and\nprecious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after\nanother out of his pocket to add to them. Then all anxiety was at an\nend, and they lived together in perfect happiness. My tale is done,\nthere runs a mouse; whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur\ncap out of it.",
        "Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\npartnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;\nthey lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\nconsiderably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into\nthe wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the\nsausage saw to the cooking.",
        "When people are too well off they always begin to long for something\nnew. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\nfellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\nhousehold arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a\npoor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\nat home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the\nfire and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room\nand rest until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to\nwatch the pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it\nwas near dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled\nin and out among the vegetables three or four times, and there they\nwere, buttered, and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the\nbird came home and had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table,\nand when they had finished their meal, they could sleep their fill\ntill the following morning: and that was really a very delightful\nlife.",
        "Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\nthe wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long\nenough, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time\nto make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg\nand pray as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the\nbird remained master of the situation, and the venture had to be made.\nThey therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the\nwood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.",
        "And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\nmade the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\ntill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\nsausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\nflew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came\nacross a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his\nlegitimate booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained\nto the dog of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any\navail, for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the\nsausage, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.",
        "He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he\nhad seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make\nthe best of things and to remain with one another.",
        "So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food\nand, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling\nin and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped\ninto the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the\nbottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but\nalso with life.",
        "Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he\ncould nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood\nhere and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was\nto be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown\ndown, caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some\nwater, but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was\nunable to recover himself, he was drowned.",
        "Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them\nwas beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,\nhowever, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own\ndaughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to\ndo all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the\nfamily. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in\nthe high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it\nchanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the\ngirl stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang\nout of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of\nher misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after\ngiving her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ’As you have let the\nspindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’",
        "The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in\nher distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.",
        "She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\nbeautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers\nblooming in every direction.",
        "She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven\nfull of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ’Take us out, take us\nout, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through\nlong ago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.",
        "She went on a little farther, till she came to a free full of apples.\n’Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ’my apples, one and all,\nare ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down\nupon her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a\nsingle apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples\ntogether in a heap and walked on again.",
        "The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an\nold woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified,\nand turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ’What are\nyou afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my\nhouse properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very\ncareful, however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you\nalways to shake it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then\nthey say, down there in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother\nHolle.’ The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up\ncourage and agreed to enter into her service.",
        "She took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding\nand every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so\nthat the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman\nwas as good as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her\nroast and boiled meats every day.",
        "So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began\nto grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she\nbecame conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew\nshe was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with\nMother Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile,\nshe went to Mother Holle and said, ’I am so homesick, that I cannot\nstay with you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must\nreturn to my own people.’",
        "Then Mother Holle said, ’I am pleased that you should want to go back\nto your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully,\nI will take you home myself.’",
        "Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate\nwas opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon\nher, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from\nhead to foot.",
        "’That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she\nspoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.",
        "The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\nworld close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the\ncock who was perched on the well, called out:",
        " ’Cock-a-doodle-doo!\n  Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’",
        "Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\ncovered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them\nall that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by\nher great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter\nto go and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the\nwell and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand\ninto a thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the\nspindle; then she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.",
        "Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it\ntill she came to the oven. ’Take us out, take us out, or alas! we\nshall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the\nloaves as before. But the lazy girl answered, ’Do you think I am going\nto dirty my hands for you?’ and walked on.",
        "Presently she came to the apple-tree. ’Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\napples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ’A\nnice thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’\nand passed on.",
        "At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all\nabout the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and\nengaged herself without delay to the old woman.",
        "The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted\nherself to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should\nget in return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her\nwork, and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie\nin bed in the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she\nneglected to make the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it\nso that the feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got\ntired of her, and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted\nat this, and thought to herself, ’The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother\nHolle led her, as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as\nshe was passing through, instead of the shower of gold, a great\nbucketful of pitch came pouring over her.",
        "’That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she\nshut the gate.",
        "So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on\nthe well called out as she saw her:",
        " ’Cock-a-doodle-doo!\n  Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’",
        "But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck\nto her as long as she lived.",
        "Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by\neveryone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and\nthere was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she\ngave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she\nwould never wear anything else; so she was always called ’Little Red-\nCap.’",
        "One day her mother said to her: ’Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\nof cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is\nill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot,\nand when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the\npath, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother\nwill get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say,\n\"Good morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’",
        "’I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave\nher hand on it.",
        "The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,\nand just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap\ndid not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid\nof him.",
        "’Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.",
        "’Thank you kindly, wolf.’",
        "’Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’",
        "’To my grandmother’s.’",
        "’What have you got in your apron?’",
        "’Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is\nto have something good, to make her stronger.’",
        "’Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’",
        "’A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands\nunder the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you\nsurely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.",
        "The wolf thought to himself: ’What a tender young creature! what a\nnice plump mouthful–she will be better to eat than the old woman. I\nmust act craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time\nby the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ’See, Little Red-Cap,\nhow pretty the flowers are about here–why do you not look round? I\nbelieve, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are\nsinging; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while\neverything else out here in the wood is merry.’",
        "Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\nhere and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing\neverywhere, she thought: ’Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay;\nthat would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall\nstill get there in good time’; and so she ran from the path into the\nwood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied\nthat she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so\ngot deeper and deeper into the wood.",
        "Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked\nat the door.",
        "’Who is there?’",
        "’Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ’She is bringing cake and wine;\nopen the door.’",
        "’Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ’I am too weak, and\ncannot get up.’",
        "The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a\nword he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then\nhe put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\nand drew the curtains.",
        "Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and\nwhen she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she\nremembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.",
        "She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\nwent into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\nherself: ’Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like\nbeing with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ’Good morning,’ but\nreceived no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.\nThere lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and\nlooking very strange.",
        "’Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ’what big ears you have!’",
        "’The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.",
        "’But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.",
        "’The better to see you with, my dear.’",
        "’But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’",
        "’The better to hug you with.’",
        "’Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’",
        "’The better to eat you with!’",
        "And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of\nbed and swallowed up Red-Cap.",
        "When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\nfell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just\npassing the house, and thought to himself: ’How the old woman is\nsnoring! I must just see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the\nroom, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in\nit. ’Do I find you here, you old sinner!’ said he. ’I have long sought\nyou!’ Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him\nthat the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might\nstill be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and\nbegan to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. When he had made\ntwo snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two\nsnips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: ’Ah, how\nfrightened I have been! How dark it was inside the wolf’; and after\nthat the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to\nbreathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which\nthey filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run\naway, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell\ndead.",
        "Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin\nand went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine\nwhich Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to\nherself: ’As long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to\nrun into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’",
        "It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the\nold grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her\nfrom the path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight\nforward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the\nwolf, and that he had said ’good morning’ to her, but with such a\nwicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road\nshe was certain he would have eaten her up. ’Well,’ said the\ngrandmother, ’we will shut the door, that he may not come in.’ Soon\nafterwards the wolf knocked, and cried: ’Open the door, grandmother, I\nam Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you some cakes.’ But they did not\nspeak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round\nthe house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until\nRed-Cap went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and\ndevour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his\nthoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said\nto the child: ’Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some sausages yesterday,\nso carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.’ Red-Cap\ncarried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the\nsausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last\nstretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing\nand began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the\ngreat trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no\none ever did anything to harm her again.",
        "There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was\ngrown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided\nfor. He said to himself, ’I will give her to the first suitable man\nwho comes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared,\nand as he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in\nhim with which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But\nthe girl did not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her\nbetrothed husband. She did not feel that she could trust him, and she\ncould not look at him nor think of him without an inward shudder. One\nday he said to her, ’You have not yet paid me a visit, although we\nhave been betrothed for some time.’ ’I do not know where your house\nis,’ she answered. ’My house is out there in the dark forest,’ he\nsaid. She tried to excuse herself by saying that she would not be able\nto find the way thither. Her betrothed only replied, ’You must come\nand see me next Sunday; I have already invited guests for that day,\nand that you may not mistake the way, I will strew ashes along the\npath.’",
        "When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\ndread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might be\nable to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and\nlentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the\nentrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and\nthese she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at\nevery step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the\ndeepest, darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house,\nlooking so grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She\nstepped inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence\nreigned throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:",
        " ’Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\n  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’",
        "The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in\na cage on the wall. Again it cried:",
        " ’Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\n  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’",
        "The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they\nwere all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the\ncellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her\nhead from shaking. ’Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ’if my betrothed\nhusband lives here?’",
        "’Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ’what a place for you to\ncome to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised\nbride, and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with\ndeath that you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that\nlarge cauldron of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As\nsoon as they have you in their power they will kill you without mercy,\nand cook and eat you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take\npity on you and save you, you would be lost.’",
        "Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid\nher from view. ’Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ’do not move or\nspeak, or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are\nall asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an\nopportunity to escape.’",
        "The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,\ndragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and\npaid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to\ndrink, three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of\nyellow, and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore\nof her dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful\nbody into pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.",
        "The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the\ncask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by\nthe robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on\nthe little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it\noff easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger\nsprang into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl\nwho was hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for\nit, but he could not find it. ’Have you looked behind the large cask?’\nsaid one of the others. But the old woman called out, ’Come and eat\nyour suppers, and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run\naway.’",
        "’The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking\nfor the finger and sat down.",
        "The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and\nbefore long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast\nasleep and snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came\nfrom behind the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the\nsleepers, who were lying close together, and every moment she was\nfilled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped\nher, so that she passed safely over them, and then she and the old\nwoman went upstairs, opened the door, and hastened as fast as they\ncould from the murderers’ den. They found the ashes scattered by the\nwind, but the peas and lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently\nabove the ground, to guide them in the moonlight along the path. All\nnight long they walked, and it was morning before they reached the\nmill. Then the girl told her father all that had happened.",
        "The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom\narrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken\ncare to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the\nfeast, each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat\nstill and did not say a word.",
        "’And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ’is there no\ntale you know? Tell us something.’",
        "’I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride. ’I went alone through\na forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within,\nbut a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:",
        " ’Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\n  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’",
        "and again a second time it said these words.’",
        "’My darling, this is only a dream.’",
        "’I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all\nempty, and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down\nto the cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not\nkeep her head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she\nanswered, “Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your\nbetrothed does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy\nand afterwards cook and eat you.\"’",
        "’My darling, this is only a dream.’",
        "’The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done\nthis when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with\nthem. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and\nyellow, and with that she died.’",
        "’My darling, this is only a dream.’",
        "’Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body\ninto pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’",
        "’My darling, this is only a dream.’",
        "’And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on\nher finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and\ncut off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind\nthe great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’ and\nwith these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the\nassembled guests.",
        "The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and\ntried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They\ndelivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were\ncondemned to death for their wicked deeds.",
        "A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the\nfireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. ’How lonely it is,\nwife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ’for you and me\nto sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse\nus while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’\n’What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round\nher wheel; ’how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were\never so small–nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb–I should be\nvery happy, and love it dearly.’ Now–odd as you may think it–it came\nto pass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very\nway she had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy,\nwho was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my\nthumb. So they said, ’Well, we cannot say we have not got what we\nwished for, and, little as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they\ncalled him Thomas Thumb.",
        "They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\nbigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.\nStill, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself\nto be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.",
        "One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut\nfuel, he said, ’I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I\nwant to make haste.’ ’Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ’I will take care of\nthat; the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the\nwoodman laughed, and said, ’How can that be? you cannot reach up to\nthe horse’s bridle.’ ’Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ’if my\nmother will only harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell\nhim which way to go.’ ’Well,’ said the father, ’we will try for once.’",
        "When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put\nTom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast\nhow to go, crying out, ’Go on!’ and ’Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the\nhorse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself\ninto the wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too\nfast, and Tom was calling out, ’Gently! gently!’ two strangers came\nup. ’What an odd thing that is!’ said one: ’there is a cart going\nalong, and I hear a carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no\none.’ ’That is queer, indeed,’ said the other; ’let us follow the\ncart, and see where it goes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at\nlast they came to the place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb,\nseeing his father, cried out, ’See, father, here I am with the cart,\nall right and safe! now take me down!’ So his father took hold of the\nhorse with one hand, and with the other took his son out of the\nhorse’s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as\nyou please.",
        "The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what\nto say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ’That\nlittle urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him\nabout from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up\nto the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man.\n’He will be better off,’ said they, ’with us than with you.’ ’I won’t\nsell him at all,’ said the father; ’my own flesh and blood is dearer\nto me than all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of\nthe bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his\nshoulder and whispered in his ear, ’Take the money, father, and let\nthem have me; I’ll soon come back to you.’",
        "So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a\nlarge piece of gold, and they paid the price. ’Where would you like to\nsit?’ said one of them. ’Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will\nbe a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country\nas we go along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken\nleave of his father they took him away with them.",
        "They journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man\nsaid, ’Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and\nput him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of\nthe road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped\ninto an old mouse-hole. ’Good night, my masters!’ said he, ’I’m off!\nmind and look sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to\nthe place, and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but\nall in vain; Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it\nbecame quite dark, so that they were forced to go their way without\ntheir prize, as sulky as could be.",
        "When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. ’What\ndangerous walking it is,’ said he, ’in this ploughed field! If I were\nto fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my\nneck.’ At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell.\n’This is lucky,’ said he, ’I can sleep here very well’; and in he\ncrept.",
        "Just as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting\ntogether; and one said to the other, ’How can we rob that rich\nparson’s house of his silver and gold?’ ’I’ll tell you!’ cried Tom.\n’What noise was that?’ said the thief, frightened; ’I’m sure I heard\nsomeone speak.’ They stood still listening, and Tom said, ’Take me\nwith you, and I’ll soon show you how to get the parson’s money.’ ’But\nwhere are you?’ said they. ’Look about on the ground,’ answered he,\n’and listen where the sound comes from.’ At last the thieves found him\nout, and lifted him up in their hands. ’You little urchin!’ they said,\n’what can you do for us?’ ’Why, I can get between the iron window-bars\nof the parson’s house, and throw you out whatever you want.’ ’That’s a\ngood thought,’ said the thieves; ’come along, we shall see what you\ncan do.’",
        "When they came to the parson’s house, Tom slipped through the window-\nbars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,\n’Will you have all that is here?’ At this the thieves were frightened,\nand said, ’Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken\nanybody.’ But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled\nout again, ’How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?’ Now the\ncook lay in the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up\nin her bed and listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran\noff a little way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said,\n’The little urchin is only trying to make fools of us.’ So they came\nback and whispered softly to him, saying, ’Now let us have no more of\nyour roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.’ Then Tom\ncalled out as loud as he could, ’Very well! hold your hands! here it\ncomes.’",
        "The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to\nopen the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails:\nand the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a\nlight. By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn;\nand when she had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and\nfound nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming\nwith her eyes open.",
        "The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug\nplace to finish his night’s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning\nto sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and\nmother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows\nhappen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before\ndaybreak, to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft,\ncarried away a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle\nof it, fast asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake\ntill he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put\nthe hay into the cow’s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a\nmouthful of it. ’Good lack-a-day!’ said he, ’how came I to tumble into\nthe mill?’ But he soon found out where he really was; and was forced\nto have all his wits about him, that he might not get between the\ncow’s teeth, and so be crushed to death. At last down he went into her\nstomach. ’It is rather dark,’ said he; ’they forgot to build windows\nin this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing.’",
        "Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters\nat all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always\ncoming down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At\nlast he cried out as loud as he could, ’Don’t bring me any more hay!\nDon’t bring me any more hay!’",
        "The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone\nspeak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same\nvoice that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she\nfell off her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could\npick herself up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to\nher master the parson, and said, ’Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But\nthe parson said, ’Woman, thou art surely mad!’ However, he went with\nher into the cow-house, to try and see what was the matter.",
        "Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out,\n’Don’t bring me any more hay!’ Then the parson himself was frightened;\nand thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on\nthe spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which\nTom lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.",
        "Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy\ntask; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh\nill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the\nwhole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.",
        "Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would\nnot dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called\nout, ’My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.’ ’Where’s that?’\nsaid the wolf. ’In such and such a house,’ said Tom, describing his\nown father’s house. ’You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen\nand then into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef,\ncold chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your\nheart can wish.’",
        "The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to\nthe house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then\ninto the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart’s content. As\nsoon as he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so\nmuch that he could not go out by the same way he came in.",
        "This was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a\ngreat shout, making all the noise he could. ’Will you be easy?’ said\nthe wolf; ’you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a\nclatter.’ ’What’s that to me?’ said the little man; ’you have had your\nfrolic, now I’ve a mind to be merry myself’; and he began, singing and\nshouting as loud as he could.",
        "The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through\na crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well\nsuppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his\naxe, and gave his wife a scythe. ’Do you stay behind,’ said the\nwoodman, ’and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up\nwith the scythe.’ Tom heard all this, and cried out, ’Father, father!\nI am here, the wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said, ’Heaven be\npraised! we have found our dear child again’; and he told his wife not\nto use the scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great\nblow, and struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and\nwhen he was dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. ’Ah!’\nsaid the father, ’what fears we have had for you!’ ’Yes, father,’\nanswered he; ’I have travelled all over the world, I think, in one way\nor other, since we parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get\nfresh air again.’ ’Why, where have you been?’ said his father. ’I have\nbeen in a mouse-hole–and in a snail-shell–and down a cow’s throat–\nand in the wolf’s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.’",
        "’Well,’ said they, ’you are come back, and we will not sell you again\nfor all the riches in the world.’",
        "Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty\nto eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new\nclothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his\njourney. So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in\npeace; for though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and\nseen so many fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole\nstory, he always agreed that, after all, there’s no place like HOME!",
        "By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream\nof water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house\nwas close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful\ndaughter. She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller\nwas so proud of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who\nused to come and hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold\nout of straw. Now this king was very fond of money; and when he heard\nthe miller’s boast his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl\nto be brought before him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace\nwhere there was a great heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel,\nand said, ’All this must be spun into gold before morning, as you love\nyour life.’ It was in vain that the poor maiden said that it was only\na silly boast of her father, for that she could do no such thing as\nspin straw into gold: the chamber door was locked, and she was left\nalone.",
        "She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard\nfate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man\nhobbled in, and said, ’Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you\nweeping for?’ ’Alas!’ said she, ’I must spin this straw into gold, and\nI know not how.’ ’What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ’to do\nit for you?’ ’My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her\nword, and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:",
        " ’Round about, round about,\n    Lo and behold!\n  Reel away, reel away,\n    Straw into gold!’",
        "And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and\nthe straw was all spun into gold.",
        "When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and\npleased; but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up\nthe poor miller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not\nwhat to do, and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened\nthe door, and said, ’What will you give me to do your task?’ ’The ring\non my finger,’ said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began\nto work at the wheel again, and whistled and sang:",
        " ’Round about, round about,\n    Lo and behold!\n  Reel away, reel away,\n    Straw into gold!’",
        "till, long before morning, all was done again.",
        "The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;\nbut still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet\nlarger heap, and said, ’All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,\nyou shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in,\nand said, ’What will you give me to spin gold for you this third\ntime?’ ’I have nothing left,’ said she. ’Then say you will give me,’\nsaid the little man, ’the first little child that you may have when\nyou are queen.’ ’That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter:\nand as she knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would\ndo what he asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the\nmanikin once more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the\nmorning, and, finding all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so\nhe married the miller’s daughter, and she really became queen.",
        "At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot\nthe dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room,\nwhere she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of\nit. Then she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give\nhim all the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in\nvain; till at last her tears softened him, and he said, ’I will give\nyou three days’ grace, and if during that time you tell me my name,\nyou shall keep your child.’",
        "Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that\nshe had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find\nout new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with\nTIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could\nremember; but to all and each of them he said, ’Madam, that is not my\nname.’",
        "The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,\nBANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little\ngentleman still said to every one of them, ’Madam, that is not my\nname.’",
        "The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ’I have\ntravelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday,\nas I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the\nfox and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and\nbefore the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little\ndwarf was dancing upon one leg, and singing:",
        " ’\"Merrily the feast I’ll make.\n  Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;\n  Merrily I’ll dance and sing,\n  For next day will a stranger bring.\n  Little does my lady dream\n  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!\"’",
        "When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her\nlittle friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her\ncourt round to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the\nbaby in her arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the\nlittle man began to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child,\nto take home with him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ’Now,\nlady, what is my name?’ ’Is it JOHN?’ asked she. ’No, madam!’ ’Is it\nTOM?’ ’No, madam!’ ’Is it JEMMY?’ ’It is not.’ ’Can your name be\nRUMPELSTILTSKIN?’ said the lady slyly. ’Some witch told you that!–\nsome witch told you that!’ cried the little man, and dashed his right\nfoot in a rage so deep into the floor, that he was forced to lay hold\nof it with both hands to pull it out.",
        "Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the\nbaby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much\ntrouble for nothing, and said, ’We wish you a very good morning, and a\nmerry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’",
        "There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and\nwhen she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and\nthat, was quite happy and thought: ’You certainly are a pretty girl!’\nAnd when she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught\nof wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of\nwhatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ’The cook\nmust know what the food is like.’",
        "It came to pass that the master one day said to her: ’Gretel, there is\na guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.’ ’I\nwill see to it, master,’ answered Gretel. She killed two fowls,\nscalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening\nset them before the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to\nturn brown, and were nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived.\nThen Gretel called out to her master: ’If the guest does not come, I\nmust take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a\nshame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest.’\nThe master said: ’I will run myself, and fetch the guest.’ When the\nmaster had turned his back, Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one\nside, and thought: ’Standing so long by the fire there, makes one\nsweat and thirsty; who knows when they will come? Meanwhile, I will\nrun into the cellar, and take a drink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said:\n’God bless it for you, Gretel,’ and took a good drink, and thought\nthat wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet\nanother hearty draught.",
        "Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,\nand drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,\nGretel thought: ’Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’ She\ntouched it with her finger, and said: ’Ah! how good fowls are! It\ncertainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right\ntime!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with\nhis guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:\n’One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.’ So\nshe cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she\nthought: ’The other must go down too, or else master will observe that\nsomething is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and\nlooked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to\nher: ’Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned\nin somewhere.’ Then she said: ’Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl\nhas been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it\nis eaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be\nspoilt?’ So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and\nate up the one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was\nswallowed down, and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at\nthe other and said: ’What one is, the other should be likewise, the\ntwo go together; what’s right for the one is right for the other; I\nthink if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm.’ So\nshe took another hearty drink, and let the second chicken follow the\nfirst.",
        "While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ’Hurry\nup, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ’Yes, sir, I will\nsoon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see\nwhat the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith\nhe was going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps.\nPresently the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the\nhouse-door. Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she\nsaw the guest, she put her finger to her lips and said: ’Hush! hush!\ngo away as quickly as you can, if my master catches you it will be the\nworse for you; he certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention\nis to cut off your two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the\nknife for it!’ The guest heard the sharpening, and hurried down the\nsteps again as fast as he could. Gretel was not idle; she ran\nscreaming to her master, and cried: ’You have invited a fine guest!’\n’Why, Gretel? What do you mean by that?’ ’Yes,’ said she, ’he has\ntaken the chickens which I was just going to serve up, off the dish,\nand has run away with them!’ ’That’s a nice trick!’ said her master,\nand lamented the fine chickens. ’If he had but left me one, so that\nsomething remained for me to eat.’ He called to him to stop, but the\nguest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him with the knife\nstill in his hand, crying: ’Just one, just one,’ meaning that the\nguest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The guest,\nhowever, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his\nears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them\nboth with him.",
        "There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears\ndull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could\nhardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let\nit run out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at\nthis, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind\nthe stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not\neven enough of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes\nfull of tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl,\nand it fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but\nhe said nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl\nfor a few half-pence, out of which he had to eat.",
        "They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old\nbegan to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ’What are\nyou doing there?’ asked the father. ’I am making a little trough,’\nanswered the child, ’for father and mother to eat out of when I am\nbig.’",
        "The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently\nbegan to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and\nhenceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if\nhe did spill a little of anything.",
        "There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\npeasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant.\nHe had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and\nyet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:\n’Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he\nshall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like\nany other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the\nwoman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and\nplaned the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with\nits head hanging down as if it were eating.",
        "Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\ncalled the cow-herd in and said: ’Look, I have a little calf there,\nbut it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ’All\nright,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set\nit among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one\nwhich was eating, and the cow-herd said: ’It will soon run by itself,\njust look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive\nthe herd home again, he said to the calf: ’If you can stand there and\neat your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag\nyou home again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door,\nand waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows\nthrough the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it\nwas. The cow-herd answered: ’It is still standing out there eating. It\nwould not stop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ’Oh,\nbut I must have my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the\nmeadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The\ncow-herd said: ’It must have run away.’ The peasant, however, said:\n’Don’t tell me that,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for\nhis carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf\nwhich had run away.",
        "And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had\nso long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for\nit, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed.\nThey salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted\nto sell the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the\nproceeds. On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with\nbroken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin.\nBut as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind,\nhe could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for\nshelter. The miller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the\npeasant: ’Lay yourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of\nbread and cheese. The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin\nbeside him, and the woman thought: ’He is tired and has gone to\nsleep.’ In the meantime came the parson; the miller’s wife received\nhim well, and said: ’My husband is out, so we will have a feast.’ The\npeasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was\nvexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and\ncheese. Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat,\nsalad, cakes, and wine.",
        "Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking\noutside. The woman said: ’Oh, heavens! It is my husband!’ she quickly\nhid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,\nthe salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet\non the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said:\n’Thank heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as\nif the world were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying\non the straw, and asked, ’What is that fellow doing there?’ ’Ah,’ said\nthe wife, ’the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for\nshelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where\nthe straw was.’ The man said: ’I have no objection, but be quick and\nget me something to eat.’ The woman said: ’But I have nothing but\nbread and cheese.’ ’I am contented with anything,’ replied the\nhusband, ’so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and\nlooked at the peasant and said: ’Come and eat some more with me.’ The\npeasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. After\nthis the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the\nground, and asked: ’What have you there?’ The peasant answered: ’I\nhave a soothsayer inside it.’ ’Can he foretell anything to me?’ said\nthe miller. ’Why not?’ answered the peasant: ’but he only says four\nthings, and the fifth he keeps to himself.’ The miller was curious,\nand said: ’Let him foretell something for once.’ Then the peasant\npinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked and made a noise like\nkrr, krr. The miller said: ’What did he say?’ The peasant answered:\n’In the first place, he says that there is some wine hidden under the\npillow.’ ’Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there and found the\nwine. ’Now go on,’ said he. The peasant made the raven croak again,\nand said: ’In the second place, he says that there is some roast meat\nin the tiled stove.’ ’Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and went\nthither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven prophesy\nstill more, and said: ’Thirdly, he says that there is some salad on\nthe bed.’ ’That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and went\nthere and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven once\nmore till he croaked, and said: ’Fourthly, he says that there are some\ncakes under the bed.’ ’That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller,\nand looked there, and found the cakes.",
        "And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller’s wife\nwas frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with\nher. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the\nlittle peasant said: ’First, we will quickly eat the four things, for\nthe fifth is something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they\nbargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy,\nuntil they agreed on three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more\npinched the raven’s head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked:\n’What did he say?’ The peasant replied: ’He says that the Devil is\nhiding outside there in the closet on the porch.’ The miller said:\n’The Devil must go out,’ and opened the house-door; then the woman was\nforced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the closet. The\nparson ran out as fast as he could, and the miller said: ’It was true;\nI saw the black rascal with my own eyes.’ The peasant, however, made\noff next morning by daybreak with the three hundred talers.",
        "At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\nhouse, and the peasants said: ’The small peasant has certainly been to\nthe place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in\nshovels.’ Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and\nbidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: ’I sold my\ncow’s skin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants\nheard that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home,\nkilled all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell\nthem in the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said:\n’But my servant must go first.’ When she came to the merchant in the\ntown, he did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when\nthe others came, he did not give them so much, and said: ’What can I\ndo with all these skins?’",
        "Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\noutwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of\nthis treachery before the major. The innocent little peasant was\nunanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water,\nin a barrel pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was\nbrought who was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all\nobliged to retire to a distance, and when the peasant looked at the\npriest, he recognized the man who had been with the miller’s wife. He\nsaid to him: ’I set you free from the closet, set me free from the\nbarrel.’ At this same moment up came, with a flock of sheep, the very\nshepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor, so\nhe cried with all his might: ’No, I will not do it; if the whole world\ninsists on it, I will not do it!’ The shepherd hearing that, came up\nto him, and asked: ’What are you about? What is it that you will not\ndo?’ The peasant said: ’They want to make me mayor, if I will but put\nmyself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’ The shepherd said: ’If\nnothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor, I would get\ninto the barrel at once.’ The peasant said: ’If you will get in, you\nwill be mayor.’ The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the peasant\nshut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’s flock for\nhimself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd, and declared\nthat the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the barrel\ntowards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried:\n’I am quite willing to be mayor.’ They believed no otherwise than that\nit was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ’That is what we\nintend, but first you shall look about you a little down below there,’\nand they rolled the barrel down into the water.",
        "After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the\nvillage, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of\nsheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,\nand said: ’Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the\nwater?’ ’Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ’I sank deep, deep down,\nuntil at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the\nbarrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number\nof lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with\nme.’ Said the peasants: ’Are there any more there?’ ’Oh, yes,’ said\nhe, ’more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds\nthat they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece,\nbut the mayor said: ’I come first.’ So they went to the water\ntogether, and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in\nthe blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they were reflected\nin the water, whereupon the peasants cried: ’We already see the sheep\ndown below!’ The mayor pressed forward and said: ’I will go down\nfirst, and look about me, and if things promise well I’ll call you.’\nSo he jumped in; splash! went the water; it sounded as if he were\ncalling them, and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man.\nThen the entire village was dead, and the small peasant, as sole heir,\nbecame a rich man.",
        "There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\nCatherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.\n’Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\nhungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of\nale.’ ’Very well,’ said she, ’it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time\ndrew nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she\nhad, and put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look\nbrown, and to crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork\nand turned it: then she said to herself, ’The steak is almost ready, I\nmay as well go to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the\nfire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale\ncask. The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At\nlast it popped into her head, ’The dog is not shut up–he may be\nrunning away with the steak; that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran\nfrom the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had got the steak in\nhis mouth, and was making off with it.",
        "Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\nfaster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ’It’s all gone, and\n\"what can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned\nround; and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home\nleisurely to cool herself.",
        "Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not\nturned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the\nfloor till the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she\nsaw what had happened. ’My stars!’ said she, ’what shall I do to keep\nFrederick from seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a\nwhile; and at last remembered that there was a sack of fine meal\nbought at the last fair, and that if she sprinkled this over the floor\nit would suck up the ale nicely. ’What a lucky thing,’ said she, ’that\nwe kept that meal! we have now a good use for it.’ So away she went\nfor it: but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of\nbeer, and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set\nswimming on the floor also. ’Ah! well,’ said she, ’when one goes\nanother may as well follow.’ Then she strewed the meal all about the\ncellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said, ’How very\nneat and clean it looks!’",
        "At noon Frederick came home. ’Now, wife,’ cried he, ’what have you for\ndinner?’ ’O Frederick!’ answered she, ’I was cooking you a steak; but\nwhile I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while\nI ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale\nwith the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but\nthe cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ’Kate, Kate,’ said\nhe, ’how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry,\nand the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ’Why, Frederick,’\nsaid she, ’I did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me\nbefore.’",
        "The husband thought to himself, ’If my wife manages matters thus, I\nmust look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house:\nso he said to Catherine, ’What pretty yellow buttons these are! I\nshall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care\nthat you never go near or meddle with them.’ ’No, Frederick,’ said\nshe, ’that I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some\npedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether\nshe would buy. ’Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have\nno money: if you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with\nyou.’ ’Yellow buttons!’ said they: ’let us have a look at them.’ ’Go\ninto the garden and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow\nbuttons: I dare not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they\nfound what these yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and\nleft her plenty of plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the\nhouse for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ’Kate,\nwhat have you been doing?’ ’See,’ said she, ’I have bought all these\nwith your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars\nwent themselves and dug them up.’ ’Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ’what\na pretty piece of work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my\nmoney: how came you to do such a thing?’ ’Why,’ answered she, ’I did\nnot know there was any harm in it; you should have told me.’",
        "Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,\n’Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after\nthe thieves.’ ’Well, we will try,’ answered he; ’but take some butter\nand cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’\n’Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the\nfastest, he left his wife some way behind. ’It does not matter,’\nthought she: ’when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than\nhe.’",
        "Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there\nwas a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on\neach side as they passed. ’Ah, see now,’ said she, ’how they have\nbruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So\nshe took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all,\nso that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing\nthis kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled\ndown the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone;\nso she said, ’Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find\nyou; he has younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other\ncheese after it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill.\nBut she said she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow\nher, and she could not stay there all day waiting for them.",
        "At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something\nto eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ’Where are the butter and\ncheese?’ said he. ’Oh!’ answered she, ’I used the butter to grease\nthose poor trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran\naway so I sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are\nboth on the road together somewhere.’ ’What a goose you are to do such\nsilly things!’ said the husband. ’How can you say so?’ said she; ’I am\nsure you never told me not.’",
        "They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ’Kate, I hope you\nlocked the door safe when you came away.’ ’No,’ answered she, ’you did\nnot tell me.’ ’Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’\nsaid Frederick, ’and bring with you something to eat.’",
        "Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\n’Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond\nof butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the\nvinegar, for I have often seen him take some.’",
        "When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door\nshe took off the hinges, and said, ’Frederick told me to lock the\ndoor, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So\nshe took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she\ncried out, ’There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch\nit as carefully as you please.’ ’Alas! alas!’ said he, ’what a clever\nwife I have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door\naway, so that everybody may go in and out as they please–however, as\nyou have brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your\npains.’ ’Very well,’ answered she, ’I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not\ncarry the nuts and vinegar bottle also–that would be too much of a\nload; so if you please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’",
        "Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off\ninto the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them:\nand when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night\nthere. Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very\nrogues they were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and\nbelonged to that class of people who find things before they are lost;\nthey were tired; so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree\nwhere Frederick and Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the\nother side, and picked up some stones. Then he climbed up again, and\ntried to hit the thieves on the head with them: but they only said,\n’It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’",
        "Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;\nbut she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she\nsaid softly, ’Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ’No,’ answered he,\n’not now, they will discover us.’ ’I can’t help that: they must go.’\n’Well, then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away\nrattled the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried,\n’Bless me, it is hailing.’",
        "A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:\nso she whispered to Frederick, ’I must throw the vinegar down.’ ’Pray\ndon’t,’ answered he, ’it will discover us.’ ’I can’t help that,’ said\nshe, ’go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves\nsaid, ’What a heavy dew there is!’",
        "At last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself\nthat was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ’Frederick, I must\nthrow the door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so,\nfor he was sure it would betray them. ’Here goes, however,’ said she:\nand down went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they\ncried out ’Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast\nas they could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine\ncame down, there they found all their money safe and sound.",
        "There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\ndaughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was\nher own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,\nbecause she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty\napron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and\ntold her mother that she must and would have that apron. ’Be quiet, my\nchild,’ said the old woman, ’and you shall have it. Your stepsister\nhas long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and\ncut her head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the\nbed, and push her well to the front.’ It would have been all over with\nthe poor girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and\nheard everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when\nbedtime had come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to\nlie at the far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her\ngently to the front, and took for herself the place at the back, close\nby the wall. In the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an\naxe in her right hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were\nlying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe with both hands,\nand cut her own child’s head off.",
        "When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart,\nwho was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she\nsaid to him: ’Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my\nstepmother wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When\ndaylight comes, and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.’\n’But,’ said Roland, ’I counsel you first to take away her magic wand,\nor we cannot escape if she pursues us.’ The maiden fetched the magic\nwand, and she took the dead girl’s head and dropped three drops of\nblood on the ground, one in front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and\none on the stairs. Then she hurried away with her lover.",
        "When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\nwanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch\ncried: ’Where are you?’ ’Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’ answered\nthe first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the\nstairs, and cried again: ’Where are you?’ ’Here in the kitchen, I am\nwarming myself,’ cried the second drop of blood. She went into the\nkitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: ’Where are you?’ ’Ah,\nhere in the bed, I am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood. She\nwent into the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,\nwhose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into a\npassion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far\ninto the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her\nsweetheart Roland. ’That shall not help you,’ cried she, ’even if you\nhave got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.’ She put on\nher many-league boots, in which she covered an hour’s walk at every\nstep, and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however,\nwhen she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her\nmagic wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck\nswimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,\nthrew breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;\nbut the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to\ngo home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart\nRoland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the\nwhole night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a\nbeautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her\nsweetheart Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch\ncame striding up towards them, and said to the musician: ’Dear\nmusician, may I pluck that beautiful flower for myself?’ ’Oh, yes,’ he\nreplied, ’I will play to you while you do it.’ As she was hastily\ncreeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower,\nknowing perfectly well who the flower was, he began to play, and\nwhether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a\nmagical dance. The faster he played, the more violent springs was she\nforced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and\npricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she\nhad to dance till she lay dead on the ground.",
        "As they were now set free, Roland said: ’Now I will go to my father\nand arrange for the wedding.’ ’Then in the meantime I will stay here\nand wait for you,’ said the girl, ’and that no one may recognize me, I\nwill change myself into a red stone landmark.’ Then Roland went away,\nand the girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her\nbeloved. But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another,\nwho so fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl\nremained there a long time, but at length, as he did not return at\nall, she was sad, and changed herself into a flower, and thought:\n’Someone will surely come this way, and trample me down.’",
        "It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and\nsaw the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him,\nand laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things\nhappened in the shepherd’s house. When he arose in the morning, all\nthe work was already done, the room was swept, the table and benches\ncleaned, the fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was\nfetched, and at noon, when he came home, the table was laid, and a\ngood dinner served. He could not conceive how this came to pass, for\nhe never saw a human being in his house, and no one could have\nconcealed himself in it. He was certainly pleased with this good\nattendance, but still at last he was so afraid that he went to a wise\nwoman and asked for her advice. The wise woman said: ’There is some\nenchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if anything is\nmoving in the room, and if you see anything, no matter what it is,\nthrow a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be stopped.’",
        "The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,\nhe saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he sprang\ntowards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the\ntransformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,\nwho admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this\ntime she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,\nand as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she\nanswered: ’No,’ for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart\nRoland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not\nto go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.",
        "And now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated,\nand then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced\nthat all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the\nbridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad\nthat she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,\nbut the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to\nsing, she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and\nthen she could not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached\nRoland’s ears, he sprang up and cried: ’I know the voice, that is the\ntrue bride, I will have no other!’ Everything he had forgotten, and\nwhich had vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his\nheart. Then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart\nRoland, and grief came to an end and joy began.",
        "It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were\nfalling around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off\nsat working at her window. The frame of the window was made of fine\nblack ebony, and as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her\nfinger, and three drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed\nthoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the white snow, and\nsaid, ’Would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow, as\nred as that blood, and as black as this ebony windowframe!’ And so the\nlittle girl really did grow up; her skin was as white as snow, her\ncheeks as rosy as the blood, and her hair as black as ebony; and she\nwas called Snowdrop.",
        "But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who\nbecame queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not\nbear to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a\nfairy looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze\nupon herself in it, and say:",
        " ’Tell me, glass, tell me true!\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’",
        "And the glass had always answered:",
        " ’Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.’",
        "But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven\nyears old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen\nherself. Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to\nlook in it as usual:",
        " ’Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,\n  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!’",
        "When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to\none of her servants, and said, ’Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,\nthat I may never see her any more.’ Then the servant led her away; but\nhis heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he\nsaid, ’I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.’ So he left her by\nherself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts\nwould tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off\nhis heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave\nher to her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.",
        "Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and\nthe wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the\nevening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest,\nfor her little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce\nand neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and\nthere were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little\nglasses with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order;\nand by the wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she\npicked a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of\neach glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So\nshe tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was\ntoo short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid\nherself down and went to sleep.",
        "By and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven\nlittle dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched\nfor gold. They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all\nwas not right. The first said, ’Who has been sitting on my stool?’ The\nsecond, ’Who has been eating off my plate?’ The third, ’Who has been\npicking my bread?’ The fourth, ’Who has been meddling with my spoon?’\nThe fifth, ’Who has been handling my fork?’ The sixth, ’Who has been\ncutting with my knife?’ The seventh, ’Who has been drinking my wine?’\nThen the first looked round and said, ’Who has been lying on my bed?’\nAnd the rest came running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody\nhad been upon his bed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all\nhis brethren to come and see her; and they cried out with wonder and\nastonishment and brought their lamps to look at her, and said, ’Good\nheavens! what a lovely child she is!’ And they were very glad to see\nher, and took care not to wake her; and the seventh dwarf slept an\nhour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone.",
        "In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,\nand said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and\nknit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would\ntake good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,\nseeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at\nhome; and they warned her, and said, ’The queen will soon find out\nwhere you are, so take care and let no one in.’",
        "But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that\nshe must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass\nand said:",
        " ’Tell me, glass, tell me true!\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’",
        "And the glass answered:",
        " ’Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’",
        "Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass\nalways spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed\nher. And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more\nbeautiful than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar,\nand went her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt.\nThen she knocked at the door, and cried, ’Fine wares to sell!’\nSnowdrop looked out at the window, and said, ’Good day, good woman!\nwhat have you to sell?’ ’Good wares, fine wares,’ said she; ’laces and\nbobbins of all colours.’ ’I will let the old lady in; she seems to be\na very good sort of body,’ thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and\nunbolted the door. ’Bless me!’ said the old woman, ’how badly your\nstays are laced! Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces.’\nSnowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood before the old\nwoman; but she set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight,\nthat Snowdrop’s breath was stopped, and she fell down as if she were\ndead. ’There’s an end to all thy beauty,’ said the spiteful queen,\nand went away home.",
        "In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how\ngrieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon\nthe ground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and\nwhen they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little\ntime she began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they\nsaid, ’The old woman was the queen herself; take care another time,\nand let no one in when we are away.’",
        "When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to\nit as before; but to her great grief it still said:",
        " ’Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’",
        "Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see\nthat Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in\nquite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a\npoisoned comb. When she reached the dwarfs’ cottage, she knocked at\nthe door, and cried, ’Fine wares to sell!’ But Snowdrop said, ’I dare\nnot let anyone in.’ Then the queen said, ’Only look at my beautiful\ncombs!’ and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that\nshe took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it\ntouched her head, the poison was so powerful that she fell down\nsenseless. ’There you may lie,’ said the queen, and went her way. But\nby good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening; and when they\nsaw Snowdrop lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and\nsoon found the poisoned comb. And when they took it away she got well,\nand told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not\nto open the door to anyone.",
        "Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when\nshe read the very same answer as before; and she said, ’Snowdrop shall\ndie, if it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself into her chamber,\nand got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and\ntempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed\nherself up as a peasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to the\ndwarfs’ cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head\nout of the window and said, ’I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs\nhave told me not.’ ’Do as you please,’ said the old woman, ’but at any\nrate take this pretty apple; I will give it you.’ ’No,’ said Snowdrop,\n’I dare not take it.’ ’You silly girl!’ answered the other, ’what are\nyou afraid of? Do you think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part,\nand I will eat the other.’ Now the apple was so made up that one side\nwas good, though the other side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much\ntempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw\nthe old woman eat, she could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put\nthe piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground.\n’This time nothing will save thee,’ said the queen; and she went home\nto her glass, and at last it said:",
        " ’Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.’",
        "And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could\nbe.",
        "When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop\nlying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were\nafraid that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her\nhair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain,\nfor the little girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a\nbier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and\nthen they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy;\nand her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said,\n’We will never bury her in the cold ground.’ And they made a coffin of\nglass, so that they might still look at her, and wrote upon it in\ngolden letters what her name was, and that she was a king’s daughter.\nAnd the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the dwarfs always\nsat by it and watched. And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned\nSnowdrop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last\na dove, and sat by her side.",
        "And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as\nthough she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as\nred as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called\nat the dwarfs’ house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written\nin golden letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and\nbesought them to let him take her away; but they said, ’We will not\npart with her for all the gold in the world.’ At last, however, they\nhad pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it\nup to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her\nlips, and Snowdrop awoke, and said, ’Where am I?’ And the prince said,\n’Thou art quite safe with me.’",
        "Then he told her all that had happened, and said, ’I love you far\nbetter than all the world; so come with me to my father’s palace, and\nyou shall be my wife.’ And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the\nprince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for\ntheir wedding.",
        "To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’s old enemy the\nqueen; and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she\nlooked in the glass and said:",
        " ’Tell me, glass, tell me true!\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’",
        "And the glass answered:",
        " ’Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;\n  But lovelier far is the new-made queen.’",
        "When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity\nwere so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride.\nAnd when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop,\nwho, as she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage,\nand fell down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned\nhappily over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up\ninto the mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had\nbeen so kind to Snowdrop in her time of need.",
        "There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\nEvery morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\nbestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to\nher and said: ’Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of\nwishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he\nhave.’ Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and\nwhen the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was\nfilled with gladness.",
        "Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild\nbeasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It\nhappened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in\nher arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that\nthe child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a\nhen, and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the\nqueen’s apron and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a\nsecret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to\nthe king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken\nfrom her by the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron,\nhe believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high\ntower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had\nhis wife put into it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven\nyears without meat or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two\nangels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to her\ntwice a day, and carried her food until the seven years were over.",
        "The cook, however, thought to himself: ’If the child has the power of\nwishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.’ So\nhe left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to\nspeak, and said to him: ’Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with\na garden, and all else that pertains to it.’ Scarcely were the words\nout of the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished\nfor. After a while the cook said to him: ’It is not well for you to be\nso alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.’ Then the king’s son\nwished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more\nbeautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played\ntogether, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook\nwent out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him,\nhowever, that the king’s son might some day wish to be with his\nfather, and thus bring him into great peril. So he went out and took\nthe maiden aside, and said: ’Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his\nbed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and\ntongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life.’ Thereupon\nhe went away, and when he returned next day she had not done it, and\nsaid: ’Why should I shed the blood of an innocent boy who has never\nharmed anyone?’ The cook once more said: ’If you do not do it, it\nshall cost you your own life.’ When he had gone away, she had a little\nhind brought to her, and ordered her to be killed, and took her heart\nand tongue, and laid them on a plate, and when she saw the old man\ncoming, she said to the boy: ’Lie down in your bed, and draw the\nclothes over you.’ Then the wicked wretch came in and said: ’Where are\nthe boy’s heart and tongue?’ The girl reached the plate to him, but\nthe king’s son threw off the quilt, and said: ’You old sinner, why did\nyou want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence. You shall\nbecome a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck, and\nshall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your\nthroat.’ And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\ninto a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\nwere ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\nflames broke forth from his throat. The king’s son remained there a\nshort while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she\nwere still alive. At length he said to the maiden: ’I will go home to\nmy own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.’ ’Ah,’\nshe replied, ’the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange\nland where I am unknown?’ As she did not seem quite willing, and as\nthey could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be\nchanged into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went\naway to his own country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went\nto the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high,\nhe wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he\nmounted up and looked inside, and cried: ’Beloved mother, Lady Queen,\nare you still alive, or are you dead?’ She answered: ’I have just\neaten, and am still satisfied,’ for she thought the angels were there.\nSaid he: ’I am your dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have\ntorn from your arms; but I am alive still, and will soon set you\nfree.’ Then he descended again, and went to his father, and caused\nhimself to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could\noffer him service. The king said yes, if he was skilful and could get\ngame for him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up\ntheir quarters in any part of the district or country. Then the\nhuntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly\nuse at the royal table. So he summoned all the huntsmen together, and\nbade them go out into the forest with him. And he went with them and\nmade them form a great circle, open at one end where he stationed\nhimself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more came running\ninside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them. Then they were\nall placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the king, and\nfor once he was able to deck his table with game, after having had\nnone at all for years.",
        "Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\nhousehold should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When\nthey were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: ’As you are\nso clever, you shall sit by me.’ He replied: ’Lord King, your majesty\nmust excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.’ But the king insisted on it,\nand said: ’You shall sit by me,’ until he did it. Whilst he was\nsitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one\nof the king’s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and\nwould ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she\nwere alive still, or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than\nthe marshal began, and said: ’Your majesty, we live joyously here, but\nhow is the queen living in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she\ndied?’ But the king replied: ’She let my dear son be torn to pieces by\nwild beasts; I will not have her named.’ Then the huntsman arose and\nsaid: ’Gracious lord father she is alive still, and I am her son, and\nI was not carried away by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old\ncook, who tore me from her arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her\napron with the blood of a chicken.’ Thereupon he took the dog with the\ngolden collar, and said: ’That is the wretch!’ and caused live coals\nto be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before the\nsight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat. On this the\nhuntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true\nshape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in the which he\nstood immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side.\nWhen the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be\ncast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman spoke further and\nsaid: ’Father, will you see the maiden who brought me up so tenderly\nand who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it, though her own\nlife depended on it?’ The king replied: ’Yes, I would like to see\nher.’ The son said: ’Most gracious father, I will show her to you in\nthe form of a beautiful flower,’ and he thrust his hand into his\npocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,\nand it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.\nThen the son said: ’Now will I show her to you in her own form,’ and\nwished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so\nbeautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.",
        "And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,\nto fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was\nled in she ate nothing, and said: ’The gracious and merciful God who\nhas supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.’ She lived three\ndays more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two\nwhite doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels\nof heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The\naged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief\nconsumed the king’s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the\nbeautiful maiden whom he had brought with him as a flower in his\npocket, and whether they are still alive or not, is known to God.",
        "There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie.\nAnd when she had grown up her father said: ’We will get her married.’\n’Yes,’ said the mother, ’if only someone would come who would have\nher.’ At length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was\ncalled Hans; but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really\nsmart. ’Oh,’ said the father, ’she has plenty of good sense’; and the\nmother said: ’Oh, she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear\nthe flies coughing.’ ’Well,’ said Hans, ’if she is not really smart, I\nwon’t have her.’ When they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the\nmother said: ’Elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then\nClever Elsie took the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar, and\ntapped the lid briskly as she went, so that the time might not appear\nlong. When she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set it\nbefore the barrel so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt\nher back or do herself any unexpected injury. Then she placed the can\nbefore her, and turned the tap, and while the beer was running she\nwould not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at the wall, and after\nmuch peering here and there, saw a pick-axe exactly above her, which\nthe masons had accidentally left there.",
        "Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ’If I get Hans, and we have\na child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to\ndraw beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then\nshe sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over\nthe misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the\ndrink, but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the\nservant: ’Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The\nmaid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming\nloudly. ’Elsie why do you weep?’ asked the maid. ’Ah,’ she answered,\n’have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he\ngrows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall\non his head, and kill him.’ Then said the maid: ’What a clever Elsie\nwe have!’ and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the\nmisfortune. After a while, as the maid did not come back, and those\nupstairs were thirsty for the beer, the man said to the boy: ’Just go\ndown into the cellar and see where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy\nwent down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both weeping\ntogether. Then he asked: ’Why are you weeping?’ ’Ah,’ said Elsie,\n’have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he\ngrows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will fall on his\nhead and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ’What a clever Elsie we have!’\nand sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly. Upstairs they\nwaited for the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said to\nthe woman: ’Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is!’ The\nwoman went down, and found all three in the midst of their\nlamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told her\nalso that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it\ngrew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said\nthe mother likewise: ’What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and\nwept with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife\ndid not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ’I must\ngo into the cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got\ninto the cellar, and they were all sitting together crying, and he\nheard the reason, and that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie\nmight perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that he might be\nkilled by the pick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath it,\ndrawing beer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried: ’Oh,\nwhat a clever Elsie!’ and sat down, and likewise wept with them. The\nbridegroom stayed upstairs alone for along time; then as no one would\ncome back he thought: ’They must be waiting for me below: I too must\ngo there and see what they are about.’ When he got down, the five of\nthem were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each out-\ndoing the other. ’What misfortune has happened then?’ asked he. ’Ah,\ndear Hans,’ said Elsie, ’if we marry each other and have a child, and\nhe is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink,\nthen the pick-axe which has been left up there might dash his brains\nout if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to weep?’ ’Come,’\nsaid Hans, ’more understanding than that is not needed for my\nhousehold, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and\nseized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.",
        "After Hans had had her some time, he said: ’Wife, I am going out to\nwork and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn\nthat we may have some bread.’ ’Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After\nHans had gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it\ninto the field with her. When she came to the field she said to\nherself: ’What shall I do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first?\nOh, I will eat first.’ Then she drank her cup of broth and when she\nwas fully satisfied, she once more said: ’What shall I do? Shall I cut\nfirst, or shall I sleep first? I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down\namong the corn and fell asleep. Hans had been at home for a long time,\nbut Elsie did not come; then said he: ’What a clever Elsie I have; she\nis so industrious that she does not even come home to eat.’ But when\nevening came and she still stayed away, Hans went out to see what she\nhad cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep.\nThen Hans hastened home and brought a fowler’s net with little bells\nand hung it round about her, and she still went on sleeping. Then he\nran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his chair and worked.\nAt length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she got\nup there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at\neach step which she took. Then she was alarmed, and became uncertain\nwhether she really was Clever Elsie or not, and said: ’Is it I, or is\nit not I?’ But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for\na time in doubt; at length she thought: ’I will go home and ask if it\nbe I, or if it be not I, they will be sure to know.’ She ran to the\ndoor of her own house, but it was shut; then she knocked at the window\nand cried: ’Hans, is Elsie within?’ ’Yes,’ answered Hans, ’she is\nwithin.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said: ’Ah, heavens! Then it\nis not I,’ and went to another door; but when the people heard the\njingling of the bells they would not open it, and she could get in\nnowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has seen her\nsince.",
        "A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for\nhim three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came\ninto the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any\nlonger; so he went to his master, and said, ’I have worked hard for\nyou a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have\nfor my trouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was\nvery simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every\nyear’s service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of\nmoney to have, and said to himself, ’Why should I work hard, and live\nhere on bad fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and\nmake myself merry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set\nout, roaming over hill and valley.",
        "As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little\ndwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry. ’Why, what should\nmake me down-hearted?’ said he; ’I am sound in health and rich in\npurse, what should I care for? I have saved up my three years’\nearnings and have it all safe in my pocket.’ ’How much may it come\nto?’ said the little man. ’Full threepence,’ replied the countryman.\n’I wish you would give them to me,’ said the other; ’I am very poor.’\nThen the man pitied him, and gave him all he had; and the little dwarf\nsaid in return, ’As you have such a kind honest heart, I will grant\nyou three wishes–one for every penny; so choose whatever you like.’\nThen the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, ’I like many\nthings better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring\ndown everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone\ndancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that\neveryone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf said he should have his\nthree wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went his way.",
        "Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry\nbefore, he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he\nmet an old miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig\nsat a thrush singing away most joyfully. ’Oh, what a pretty bird!’\nsaid the miser; ’I would give a great deal of money to have such a\none.’ ’If that’s all,’ said the countryman, ’I will soon bring it\ndown.’ Then he took up his bow, and down fell the thrush into the\nbushes at the foot of the tree. The miser crept into the bush to find\nit; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his\nfiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about,\ncapering higher and higher in the air. The thorns soon began to tear\nhis clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself was\nall scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down. ’Oh, for\nheaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ’Master! master! pray let the fiddle\nalone. What have I done to deserve this?’ ’Thou hast shaved many a\npoor soul close enough,’ said the other; ’thou art only meeting thy\nreward’: so he played up another tune. Then the miser began to beg and\npromise, and offered money for his liberty; but he did not come up to\nthe musician’s price for some time, and he danced him along brisker\nand brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till at last he\noffered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse, and had\njust gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman saw so\nmuch money, he said, ’I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took the\npurse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his\nbargain.",
        "Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\nplight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve\nhis late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and\ncomplained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him\ninto the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his\nback and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his\nofficers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he\nwas soon caught and brought up to be tried.",
        "The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his\nmoney. ’No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the\ncountryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the\nmatter short by ordering him off to the gallows.",
        "So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ’My Lord\nJudge, grant me one last request.’ ’Anything but thy life,’ replied\nthe other. ’No,’ said he, ’I do not ask my life; only to let me play\nupon my fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ’Oh, no! no!\nfor heaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the\njudge said, ’It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact\nwas, he could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third\ngift.",
        "Then the miser said, ’Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’\nBut the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the\nfirst note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began\ncapering, and no one could hold the miser. At the second note the\nhangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had\nplayed the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together–judge,\ncourt, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on. At\nfirst the thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on\na while, and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing, they\nbegan to cry out, and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit\nthe more for their entreaties, till the judge not only gave him his\nlife, but promised to return him the hundred florins.",
        "Then he called to the miser, and said, ’Tell us now, you vagabond,\nwhere you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’\n’I stole it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ’I\nacknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the\ncountryman stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at\nthe gallows.",
        "The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew\nnigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ’Always\nbe a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’\nSoon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the\ngarden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and\nwas always good and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and\nspread a beautiful white covering over the grave; but by the time the\nspring came, and the sun had melted it away again, her father had\nmarried another wife. This new wife had two daughters of her own, that\nshe brought home with her; they were fair in face but foul at heart,\nand it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl. ’What does the\ngood-for-nothing want in the parlour?’ said they; ’they who would eat\nbread should first earn it; away with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they\ntook away her fine clothes, and gave her an old grey frock to put on,\nand laughed at her, and turned her into the kitchen.",
        "There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight,\nto bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides\nthat, the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at\nher. In the evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on,\nbut was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of\ncourse, made her always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.",
        "It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his\nwife’s daughters what he should bring them. ’Fine clothes,’ said the\nfirst; ’Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ’Now, child,’ said he\nto his own daughter, ’what will you have?’ ’The first twig, dear\nfather, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come\nhomewards,’ said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine\nclothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way\nhome, as he rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against\nhim, and almost pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it\naway; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took\nit, and went to her mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so\nmuch that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became\na fine tree. Three times every day she went to it and cried; and soon\na little bird came and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with\nher, and watched over her, and brought her whatever she wished for.",
        "Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to\nlast three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose\na bride for himself. Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so\nthey called her up, and said, ’Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes,\nand tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s\nfeast.’ Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could\nnot help crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked\nto have gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother\nvery hard to let her go. ’You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ’you who have\nnothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance–you\nwant to go to the ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at\nlast, to get rid of her, ’I will throw this dishful of peas into the\nash-heap, and if in two hours’ time you have picked them all out, you\nshall go to the feast too.’",
        "Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden\nran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:",
        " ’Hither, hither, through the sky,\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\n  One and all come help me, quick!\n  Haste ye, haste ye!–pick, pick, pick!’",
        "Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next\ncame two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\nheaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.\nAnd the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,\npick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among\nthem all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a\ndish but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was\nquite done, and all flew out again at the windows.",
        "Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the\nthought that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ’No,\nno! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not\ngo.’ And when Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ’If you can\nin one hour’s time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes,\nyou shall go too.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of\nher. So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.",
        "But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the\nhouse, and cried out as before:",
        " ’Hither, hither, through the sky,\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\n  One and all come help me, quick!\n  Haste ye, haste ye!–pick, pick, pick!’",
        "Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came\ntwo turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\nheaven, chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes;\nand the little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick,\npick; and then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the\ngood grain into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an\nhour’s time all was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel\ntook the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now\ngo to the ball. But her mother said, ’It is all of no use, you cannot\ngo; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us\nto shame’: and off she went with her two daughters to the ball.",
        "Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went\nsorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:",
        " ’Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\n  Gold and silver over me!’",
        "Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and\nsilver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them\non, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,\nand thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and\nbeautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of\nAshputtel, taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the\ndirt.",
        "The king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and\ndanced with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when\nanyone else came to ask her to dance, he said, ’This lady is dancing\nwith me.’",
        "Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to\ngo home: and the king’s son said, ’I shall go and take care of you to\nyour home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But\nshe slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as\nthe prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut\nthe door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that\nthe unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the\npigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one\nwithin; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as\nshe always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little\nlamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she\ncould through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there\ntaken off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that\nthe bird might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes\nin her little grey frock.",
        "The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother,\nand sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:",
        " ’Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\n  Gold and silver over me!’",
        "And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she had\nworn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone\nwondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her,\ntook her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her\nto dance, he said as before, ’This lady is dancing with me.’",
        "When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed\nhere as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she\nsprang away from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s\nhouse. In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit;\nand Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it\nwithout being seen. Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could\nnot find out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home,\nand said to him, ’The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped\naway, and I think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father\nthought to himself, ’Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought;\nand they cut down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they\ncame back into the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for\nshe had slipped down on the other side of the tree, and carried her\nbeautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on\nher little grey frock.",
        "The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she\nwent again into the garden, and said:",
        " ’Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\n  Gold and silver over me!’",
        "Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the\nformer one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came\nto the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and\nthe king’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked\nher to dance, he said, ’This lady is /my/ partner, sir.’",
        "When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go\nwith her, and said to himself, ’I will not lose her this time’; but,\nhowever, she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that\nshe dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs.",
        "The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his\nfather, and said, ’I will take for my wife the lady that this golden\nslipper fits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for\nthey had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the\ngolden slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper\nwas, and wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great\ntoe could not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small\nfor her. Then the mother gave her a knife, and said, ’Never mind, cut\nit off; when you are queen you will not care about toes; you will not\nwant to walk.’ So the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus\nsqueezed on the shoe, and went to the king’s son. Then he took her for\nhis bride, and set her beside him on his horse, and rode away with her\nhomewards.",
        "But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that\nAshputtel had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:",
        " ’Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\n  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’",
        "Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the\nblood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he\nturned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,\nand said, ’This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and\nput on the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into\nthe shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother\nsqueezed it in till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son:\nand he set her as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away\nwith her.",
        "But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,\nand sang:",
        " ’Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\n  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’",
        "Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the\nshoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse\nand brought her also back again. ’This is not the true bride,’ said he\nto the father; ’have you no other daughters?’ ’No,’ said he; ’there is\nonly a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am\nsure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her. But\nthe mother said, ’No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to\nshow herself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first\nwashed her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and\nhe reached her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off\nher left foot, and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if\nit had been made for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face\nhe knew her, and said, ’This is the right bride.’ But the mother and\nboth the sisters were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he\ntook Ashputtel on his horse, and rode away with her. And when they\ncame to the hazel-tree, the white dove sang:",
        " ’Home! home! look at the shoe!\n  Princess! the shoe was made for you!\n  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,\n  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’",
        "And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon\nher right shoulder, and so went home with her.",
        "A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom\nthrough all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if\nnews of the most secret things was brought to him through the air. But\nhe had a strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was\ncleared, and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring\nhim one more dish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did\nnot know what was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never\ntook off the cover to eat of it until he was quite alone.",
        "This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took\naway the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help\ncarrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the\ndoor, he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish.\nBut when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting\nit, so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had\nit touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little\nvoices outside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that\nit was the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one\nanother of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and\nwoods. Eating the snake had given him power of understanding the\nlanguage of animals.",
        "Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most\nbeautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this\ntrusty servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the\nman to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that\nunless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself\nshould be looked upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his\ninnocence; he was dismissed with no better answer.",
        "In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took\nthought how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were\nsitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst\nthey were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were\nhaving a confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and\nlistened. They were telling one another of all the places where they\nhad been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had\nfound; and one said in a pitiful tone: ’Something lies heavy on my\nstomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under\nthe queen’s window.’ The servant at once seized her by the neck,\ncarried her to the kitchen, and said to the cook: ’Here is a fine\nduck; pray, kill her.’ ’Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his\nhand; ’she has spared no trouble to fatten herself, and has been\nwaiting to be roasted long enough.’ So he cut off her head, and as she\nwas being dressed for the spit, the queen’s ring was found inside her.",
        "The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to\nmake amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised\nhim the best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant\nrefused everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for\ntravelling, as he had a mind to see the world and go about a little.\nWhen his request was granted he set out on his way, and one day came\nto a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping\nfor water. Now, though it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them\nlamenting that they must perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind\nheart, he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the\nwater. They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him:\n’We will remember you and repay you for saving us!’",
        "He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice\nin the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain:\n’Why cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That\nstupid horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people\nwithout mercy!’ So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried\nout to him: ’We will remember you–one good turn deserves another!’",
        "The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing\nby their nest, and throwing out their young ones. ’Out with you, you\nidle, good-for-nothing creatures!’ cried they; ’we cannot find food\nfor you any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for\nyourselves.’ But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping\ntheir wings, and crying: ’Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must\nshift for ourselves, and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie\nhere and starve?’ So the good young fellow alighted and killed his\nhorse with his sword, and gave it to them for food. Then they came\nhopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and cried: ’We will remember\nyou–one good turn deserves another!’",
        "And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long way,\nhe came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in the\nstreets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ’The king’s\ndaughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a\nhard task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.’ Many\nhad already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth\nsaw the king’s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he\nforgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a\nsuitor.",
        "So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it,\nbefore his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from\nthe bottom of the sea, and added: ’If you come up again without it you\nwill be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.’\nAll the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away,\nleaving him alone by the sea.",
        "He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly\nhe saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very\nfishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel\nin its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet, and when\nhe had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the\nshell. Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would\ngrant him the promised reward.",
        "But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in\nbirth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another\ntask. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten\nsacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: ’Tomorrow morning\nbefore sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be\nwanting.’",
        "The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be\npossible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and\nthere he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be\nled to death. But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the\ngarden he saw all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and\nnot a single grain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night\nwith thousands and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had\nby great industry picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into\nthe sacks.",
        "Presently the king’s daughter herself came down into the garden, and\nwas amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given\nhim. But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said:\n’Although he has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband\nuntil he had brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’ The youth did\nnot know where the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have\ngone on for ever, as long as his legs would carry him, though he had\nno hope of finding it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms,\nhe came one evening to a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But\nhe heard a rustling in the branches, and a golden apple fell into his\nhand. At the same time three ravens flew down to him, perched\nthemselves upon his knee, and said: ’We are the three young ravens\nwhom you saved from starving; when we had grown big, and heard that\nyou were seeking the Golden Apple, we flew over the sea to the end of\nthe world, where the Tree of Life stands, and have brought you the\napple.’ The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden\nApple to the king’s beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses\nleft to make. They cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it together;\nand then her heart became full of love for him, and they lived in\nundisturbed happiness to a great age.",
        "There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\nloved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she\nwanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all\nseven to her and said: ’Dear children, I have to go into the forest,\nbe on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you\nall–skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself,\nbut you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’\nThe kids said: ’Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you\nmay go away without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went\non her way with an easy mind.",
        "It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:\n’Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought\nsomething back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew\nthat it was the wolf, by the rough voice. ’We will not open the door,’\ncried they, ’you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice,\nbut your voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to\na shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and\nmade his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of\nthe house, and called: ’Open the door, dear children, your mother is\nhere and has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the\nwolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw\nthem and cried: ’We will not open the door, our mother has not black\nfeet like you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and\nsaid: ’I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when\nthe baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said:\n’Strew some white meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to\nhimself: ’The wolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the\nwolf said: ’If you will not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller\nwas afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of\nmankind.",
        "So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked\nat it and said: ’Open the door for me, children, your dear little\nmother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back\nfrom the forest with her.’ The little kids cried: ’First show us your\npaws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put\nhis paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were\nwhite, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door.\nBut who should come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to\nhide themselves. One sprang under the table, the second into the bed,\nthe third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into\nthe cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into\nthe clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and used no great\nceremony; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat. The\nyoungest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find.\nWhen the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid\nhimself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to\nsleep. Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest.\nAh! what a sight she saw there! The house-door stood wide open. The\ntable, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay\nbroken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed.\nShe sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found. She called\nthem one after another by name, but no one answered. At last, when she\ncame to the youngest, a soft voice cried: ’Dear mother, I am in the\nclock-case.’ She took the kid out, and it told her that the wolf had\ncome and had eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how she wept\nover her poor children.",
        "At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with\nher. When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and\nsnored so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every\nside and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged\nbelly. ’Ah, heavens,’ she said, ’is it possible that my poor children\nwhom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then\nthe kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread,\nand the goat cut open the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made\none cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut\nfarther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still\nalive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his greediness the\nmonster had swallowed them down whole. What rejoicing there was! They\nembraced their dear mother, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding.\nThe mother, however, said: ’Now go and look for some big stones, and\nwe will fill the wicked beast’s stomach with them while he is still\nasleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged the stones thither with all\nspeed, and put as many of them into this stomach as they could get in;\nand the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste, so that he\nwas not aware of anything and never once stirred.",
        "When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,\nand as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to\ngo to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about,\nthe stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then\ncried he:",
        " ’What rumbles and tumbles\n  Against my poor bones?\n  I thought ’twas six kids,\n  But it feels like big stones.’",
        "And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the\nheavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the\nseven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud:\n’The wolf is dead! The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about\nthe well with their mother.",
        "Two kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their\nfortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so\nthat they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a\nlittle insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but\nwhen he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who\nwas so young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when\nthey, who were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they\nall set out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-\nhill. The two elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to\nsee how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off\ntheir eggs. But the little dwarf said, ’Let the poor things enjoy\nthemselves, I will not suffer you to trouble them.’",
        "So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were\nswimming about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them.\nBut the dwarf said, ’Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall\nnot kill them.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and\nthere was so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two\nbrothers wanted to light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so\nas to get their honey. But the dwarf held them back, and said, ’Let\nthe pretty insects enjoy themselves, I cannot let you burn them.’",
        "At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by\nthe stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of\nmarble, and no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the\nrooms, till they came to a door on which were three locks: but in the\nmiddle of the door was a wicket, so that they could look into the next\nroom. There they saw a little grey old man sitting at a table; and\nthey called to him once or twice, but he did not hear: however, they\ncalled a third time, and then he rose and came out to them.",
        "He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful\ntable covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten\nand drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.",
        "The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,\nwhere there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by\nwhich the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ’In the\nwood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s\ndaughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,\nhe who seeks them will be turned into marble.’",
        "The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:\nbut the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he\nwas turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.",
        "The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded\nno better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of\nthe pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.",
        "At last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but\nit was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!–so he\nsat down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the\nants (whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand\nants; and it was not long before they had found all the pearls and\nlaid them in a heap.",
        "The second tablet said: ’The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be\nfished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,\nhe saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they\ndived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.",
        "The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and\nthe best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful,\nand all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a\npiece of sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful\nof honey; so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.",
        "Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little\ndwarf from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last\nshe sat upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the\ndwarf knew which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all\nwho had been turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms.\nAnd the dwarf married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and\nwas king after her father’s death; but his two brothers married the\nother two sisters.",
        "There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:\nbut still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he\nhad in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair\nof shoes.",
        "Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day,\nmeaning to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was\nclear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went\npeaceably to bed, left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep.\nIn the morning after he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to\nhis work; when, to his great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready\nmade, upon the table. The good man knew not what to say or think at\nsuch an odd thing happening. He looked at the workmanship; there was\nnot one false stitch in the whole job; all was so neat and true, that\nit was quite a masterpiece.",
        "The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that\nhe willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor\nshoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs\nmore. In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that\nhe might get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the\ntrouble, for when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to\nhis hand. Soon in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods,\nso that he bought leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the\nwork again overnight and found it done in the morning, as before; and\nso it went on for some time: what was got ready in the evening was\nalways done by daybreak, and the good man soon became thriving and\nwell off again.",
        "One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting\nover the fire chatting together, he said to her, ’I should like to sit\nup and watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my\nwork for me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light\nburning, and hid themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain\nthat was hung up there, and watched what would happen.",
        "As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and\nthey sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work\nthat was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers,\nstitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the\nshoemaker was all wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on\nthey went, till the job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for\nuse upon the table. This was long before daybreak; and then they\nbustled away as quick as lightning.",
        "The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ’These little wights have\nmade us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good\nturn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and\nindeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs\nto keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a\nshirt, and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the\nbargain; and do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’",
        "The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when\nall the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the\nwork that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to\nwatch what the little elves would do.",
        "About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the\nroom, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they\nsaw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed\nmightily delighted.",
        "Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced\nand capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they\ndanced out at the door, and away over the green.",
        "The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them\nfrom that time forward, as long as they lived.",
        "Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich man\nwith a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but\nsorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire to\nhave one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they\nremained childless.",
        "In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.\nOne winter’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples,\nand as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on\nthe snow. ’Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ’if I had but a child, as\nred as blood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her\nheart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was\ngranted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A\nmonth passed, and the snow had all disappeared; then another month\nwent by, and all the earth was green. So the months followed one\nanother, and first the trees budded in the woods, and soon the green\nbranches grew thickly intertwined, and then the blossoms began to\nfall. Once again the wife stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so\nfull of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy, and she was so\novercome with her happiness, that she fell on her knees. Presently the\nfruit became round and firm, and she was glad and at peace; but when\nthey were fully ripe she picked the berries and ate eagerly of them,\nand then she grew sad and ill. A little while later she called her\nhusband, and said to him, weeping. ’If I die, bury me under the\njuniper-tree.’ Then she felt comforted and happy again, and before\nanother month had passed she had a little child, and when she saw that\nit was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy was so great that\nshe died.",
        "Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for\nher. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times\nhe still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and\nlater on he married again.",
        "He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife\nwas a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother\nloved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then\nlooked at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always\nstand in the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking\nhow she could get the whole of the property for her. This evil thought\ntook possession of her more and more, and made her behave very\nunkindly to the boy. She drove him from place to place with cuffings\nand buffetings, so that the poor child went about in fear, and had no\npeace from the time he left school to the time he went back.",
        "One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the store-\nroom, and said, ’Mother, give me an apple.’ ’Yes, my child,’ said the\nwife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest\nhad a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.",
        "’Mother,’ said the little daughter again, ’may not brother have one\ntoo?’ The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ’Yes, when he\ncomes out of school.’",
        "Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it\nseemed as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the\napple out of her little daughter’s hand, and said, ’You shall not have\none before your brother.’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut\nit to. The little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife\nmade her say kindly to him, ’My son, will you have an apple?’ but she\ngave him a wicked look. ’Mother,’ said the boy, ’how dreadful you\nlook! Yes, give me an apple.’ The thought came to her that she would\nkill him. ’Come with me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the\nchest; ’take one out for yourself.’ And as he bent over to do so, the\nevil spirit urged her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the\nlittle boy’s head. Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought\nof what she had done. ’If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did\nit,’ she thought. So she went upstairs to her room, and took a white\nhandkerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy’s head again\non his shoulders, and bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing\ncould be seen, and placed him on a chair by the door with an apple in\nhis hand.",
        "Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring\na pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ’Mother, brother is\nsitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;\nand when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that\nfrightened me.’",
        "’Go to him again,’ said her mother, ’and if he does not answer, give\nhim a box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ’Brother,\ngive me that apple,’ but he did not say a word; then she gave him a\nbox on the ear, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this,\nthat she ran crying and screaming to her mother. ’Oh!’ she said, ’I\nhave knocked off brother’s head,’ and then she wept and wept, and\nnothing would stop her.",
        "’What have you done!’ said her mother, ’but no one must know about it,\nso you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make\nhim into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made\nhim into puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking\non, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there\nwas no need of salt.",
        "Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,\n’Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish\nof black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.",
        "The father again asked, ’Where is my son?’",
        "’Oh,’ answered the wife, ’he is gone into the country to his mother’s\ngreat uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’",
        "’What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’",
        "’Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite\nsix weeks; he is well looked after there.’",
        "’I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ’in case it should\nnot be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’",
        "With this he went on with his dinner, and said, ’Little Marleen, why\ndo you weep? Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for\nmore pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.",
        "Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out\nof her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under\nthe table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing\nbut weep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-\ntree, and she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to\nleave her, and she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to\nmove, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from\none another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping\ntheir hands for joy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the\nmidst of it there was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there\nflew a beautiful bird, that rose high into the air, singing\nmagnificently, and when it could no more be seen, the juniper-tree\nstood there as before, and the silk handkerchief and the bones were\ngone.",
        "Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother\nwere still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down\ncheerfully to the table and ate.",
        "The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began\nto sing:",
        " ’My mother killed her little son;\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’",
        "The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard\nthe song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he\ngot up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his\nslippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper\non one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and\nstill held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he\nstood gazing up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down\non the street.",
        "’Bird,’ he said, ’how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.’",
        "’Nay,’ said the bird, ’I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold\nchain, and I will sing it you again.’",
        "’Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. ’Only sing me that\nagain.’",
        "The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then\nhe alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:",
        " ’My mother killed her little son;\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’",
        "Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and\nsang:",
        " ’My mother killed her little son;\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’",
        "The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his shirt-\nsleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his hand\nover his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.",
        "’Bird,’ he said, ’how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through\nthe door to his wife: ’Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look\nat it and hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter\nand the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all\nran up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was\nwith its red and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and\neyes like two bright stars in its head.",
        "’Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ’sing me that song again.’",
        "’Nay,’ answered the bird, ’I do not sing twice for nothing; you must\ngive me something.’",
        "’Wife,’ said the man, ’go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will\nsee a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and\nfetched the shoes.",
        "’There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ’now sing me that song again.’",
        "The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then\nhe went back to the roof and sang:",
        " ’My mother killed her little son;\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’",
        "When he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw\nand the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the\nmill went ’Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside the mill\nwere twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ’Hick\nhack, hick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ’Click clack, click clack,\nclick clack.’",
        "The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:",
        " ’My mother killed her little son;",
        "then one of the men left off,",
        "  My father grieved when I was gone;",
        "two more men left off and listened,",
        "  My sister loved me best of all;",
        "then four more left off,",
        "  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie",
        "now there were only eight at work,",
        "  Underneath",
        "And now only five,",
        "the juniper-tree.",
        "and now only one,",
        "  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’",
        "then he looked up and the last one had left off work.",
        "’Bird,’ he said, ’what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear\nit too; sing it again.’",
        "’Nay,’ answered the bird, ’I do not sing twice for nothing; give me\nthat millstone, and I will sing it again.’",
        "’If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ’you should have it.’",
        "’Yes, yes,’ said the others: ’if he will sing again, he can have it.’",
        "The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up\nthe stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and\ntook the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to\nthe tree and sang–",
        " ’My mother killed her little son;\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\n  My sister loved me best of all;\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’",
        "And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the\nchain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone\nround his neck, he flew right away to his father’s house.",
        "The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.",
        "’How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ’so pleased and cheerful.’",
        "’And I,’ said the mother, ’I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy\nthunderstorm were coming.’",
        "But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.",
        "Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.",
        "’I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ’and how beautifully the sun\nshines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’",
        "’Ah!’ said the wife, ’and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that\nmy teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and\nshe tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the\ncorner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.",
        "The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:",
        " ’My mother killed her little son;",
        "the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear\nnothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a\nviolent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:",
        "  My father grieved when I was gone;",
        "’Look, mother,’ said the man, ’at the beautiful bird that is singing\nso magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a\ndelicious scent of spice in the air!’",
        "  My sister loved me best of all;",
        "then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.",
        "’I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man.",
        "’Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife. ’I feel as if the whole house were in\nflames!’",
        "But the man went out and looked at the bird.",
        " She laid her kerchief over me,\n And took my bones that they might lie\n Underneath the juniper-tree\n Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’",
        "With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the\nman’s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.",
        "He went inside, and said, ’See, what a splendid bird that is; he has\ngiven me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’",
        "But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,\nand her cap fell from her head.",
        "Then the bird began again:",
        " ’My mother killed her little son;",
        "’Ah me!’ cried the wife, ’if I were but a thousand feet beneath the\nearth, that I might not hear that song.’",
        "  My father grieved when I was gone;",
        "then the woman fell down again as if dead.",
        "  My sister loved me best of all;",
        "’Well,’ said little Marleen, ’I will go out too and see if the bird\nwill give me anything.’",
        "So she went out.",
        "  She laid her kerchief over me,\n  And took my bones that they might lie",
        "and he threw down the shoes to her,",
        "  Underneath the juniper-tree\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’",
        "And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes\nand danced and jumped about in them. ’I was so miserable,’ she said,\n’when I came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a\nsplendid bird, and he has given me a pair of red shoes.’",
        "The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like\nflames of fire. ’Then I will go out too,’ she said, ’and see if it\nwill lighten my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an\nend.’",
        "But as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone\ndown on her head, and she was crushed to death.",
        "The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they\nonly saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these\nhad passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and\nlittle Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went\ninside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.",
        "There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and\nthe other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself;\nso, pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground\nwell, and sowed turnips.",
        "When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest;\nand it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never\ncease growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips\nfor there never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At\nlast it was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly\ndraw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it,\nnor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said\nto himself, ’What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no\nmore than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than\nthis; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as\na mark of respect.’",
        "Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it\nto the king. ’What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ’I have seen\nmany strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did\nyou get the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true\nchild of fortune.’ ’Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ’I am no child of\nfortune; I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon;\nso I laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I\nhave a brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all\nthe world knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’",
        "The king then took pity on him, and said, ’You shall be poor no\nlonger. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than\nyour brother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made\nhim so rich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared\nwith his.",
        "When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the\ngardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he\ncould contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he\ndetermined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together\na rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he\nmust have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had\nreceived so much for only a turnip, what must his present be wroth?",
        "The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to\ngive in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so\nthe soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with\nhim. When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and\nspite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he\nresolved to kill his brother.",
        "So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where\nto lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ’Dear brother, I\nhave found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it\nbetween us.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went\nout together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed\nout upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.",
        "But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a\nhorse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their\nprisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by\na cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away.\nMeantime he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough\nto put out his head.",
        "When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,\nwho was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon\nas the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out,\n’Good morning! good morning to thee, my friend!’ The student looked\nabout everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice\ncame from, cried out, ’Who calls me?’",
        "Then the man in the tree answered, ’Lift up thine eyes, for behold\nhere I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time,\nlearned great and wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the\nlearning of the schools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall\nknow all that man can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest\nof mankind. Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and\nthe stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on\nthe seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of\nbirds, and of precious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend,\nthough wouldst feel and own the power of knowledge.",
        "The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,\n’Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to\nlet me into the sack for a little while?’ Then the other answered, as\nif very unwillingly, ’A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if\nthou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry\nyet an hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet\nunknown to me.’",
        "So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung\nheavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend\nforthwith, for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other\npretended to give way, and said, ’Thou must let the sack of wisdom\ndescend, by untying yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.’ So the\nstudent let him down, opened the sack, and set him free. ’Now then,’\ncried he, ’let me ascend quickly.’ As he began to put himself into the\nsack heels first, ’Wait a while,’ said the gardener, ’that is not the\nway.’ Then he pushed him in head first, tied up the sack, and soon\nswung up the searcher after wisdom dangling in the air. ’How is it\nwith thee, friend?’ said he, ’dost thou not feel that wisdom comes\nunto thee? Rest there in peace, till thou art a wiser man than thou\nwert.’",
        "So saying, he trotted off on the student’s nag, and left the poor\nfellow to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.",

        "An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he\nwas stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: ’Hark you,\nmy son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go\nfrom hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who\nshall see what he can do with you.’ The youth was sent into a strange\ntown, and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this\ntime, he came home again, and his father asked: ’Now, my son, what\nhave you learnt?’ ’Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they\nbark.’ ’Lord have mercy on us!’ cried the father; ’is that all you\nhave learnt? I will send you into another town, to another master.’\nThe youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master\nlikewise. When he came back the father again asked: ’My son, what have\nyou learnt?’ He answered: ’Father, I have learnt what the birds say.’\nThen the father fell into a rage and said: ’Oh, you lost man, you have\nspent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to\nappear before my eyes? I will send you to a third master, but if you\nlearn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father.’ The\nyouth remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he\ncame home again, and his father inquired: ’My son, what have you\nlearnt?’ he answered: ’Dear father, I have this year learnt what the\nfrogs croak.’ Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang\nup, called his people thither, and said: ’This man is no longer my\nson, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the\nforest, and kill him.’ They took him forth, but when they should have\nkilled him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they\ncut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to\nthe old man as a token.",
        "The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he\nbegged for a night’s lodging. ’Yes,’ said the lord of the castle, ’if\nyou will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I\nwarn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild\ndogs, which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man\nhas to be given to them, whom they at once devour.’ The whole district\nwas in sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do\nanything to stop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said:\n’Just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I\ncan throw to them; they will do nothing to harm me.’ As he himself\nwould have it so, they gave him some food for the wild animals, and\nled him down to the tower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark\nat him, but wagged their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he\nset before them, and did not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning,\nto the astonishment of everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed,\nand said to the lord of the castle: ’The dogs have revealed to me, in\ntheir own language, why they dwell there, and bring evil on the land.\nThey are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over a great treasure\nwhich is below in the tower, and they can have no rest until it is\ntaken away, and I have likewise learnt, from their discourse, how that\nis to be done.’ Then all who heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the\ncastle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it\nsuccessfully. He went down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he\ndid it thoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him. The\nhowling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had\ndisappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble.",
        "After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome.\nOn the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were\nsitting croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of\nwhat they were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he\narrived in Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great\ndoubt among the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his\nsuccessor. They at length agreed that the person should be chosen as\npope who should be distinguished by some divine and miraculous token.\nAnd just as that was decided on, the young count entered into the\nchurch, and suddenly two snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and\nremained sitting there. The ecclesiastics recognized therein the token\nfrom above, and asked him on the spot if he would be pope. He was\nundecided, and knew not if he were worthy of this, but the doves\ncounselled him to do it, and at length he said yes. Then was he\nanointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled what he had heard\nfrom the frogs on his way, which had so affected him, that he was to\nbe his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and did not know\none word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders,\nand said it all in his ear.",
        "It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought\nto herself: ’He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in\nthe world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ’Good day, dear Mr\nFox, how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these\nhard times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the\ncat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he\nwould give any answer or not. At last he said: ’Oh, you wretched\nbeard-cleaner, you piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you\nbe thinking of? Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What\nhave you learnt? How many arts do you understand?’ ’I understand but\none,’ replied the cat, modestly. ’What art is that?’ asked the fox.\n’When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save\nmyself.’ ’Is that all?’ said the fox. ’I am master of a hundred arts,\nand have into the bargain a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for\nyou; come with me, I will teach you how people get away from the\nhounds.’ Just then came a hunter with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly\nup a tree, and sat down at the top of it, where the branches and\nfoliage quite concealed her. ’Open your sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’\ncried the cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were\nholding him fast. ’Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the cat. ’You with your hundred\narts are left in the lurch! Had you been able to climb like me, you\nwould not have lost your life.’",
        "’Dear children,’ said a poor man to his four sons, ’I have nothing to\ngive you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin\nby learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.’ So the\nfour brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their\nlittle bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father\ngoodbye, went all out at the gate together. When they had got on some\nway they came to four crossways, each leading to a different country.\nThen the eldest said, ’Here we must part; but this day four years we\nwill come back to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he\ncan do for himself.’",
        "So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man\nmet him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. ’I am\ngoing to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by\nlearning some art or trade,’ answered he. ’Then,’ said the man, ’go\nwith me, and I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever\nwas.’ ’No,’ said the other, ’that is not an honest calling, and what\ncan one look to earn by it in the end but the gallows?’ ’Oh!’ said the\nman, ’you need not fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to\nsteal what will be fair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one\nelse can get or care anything about, and where no one can find you\nout.’ So the young man agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed\nhimself so clever, that nothing could escape him that he had once set\nhis mind upon.",
        "The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was\nsetting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. ’I do not\nknow yet,’ said he. ’Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a\nnoble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you\nunderstand the stars.’ The plan pleased him much, and he soon became\nsuch a skilful star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and\nwanted to leave his master, he gave him a glass, and said, ’With this\nyou can see all that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing\ncan be hidden from you.’",
        "The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught\nhim so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever\nin the craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a\nbow, and said, ’Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure\nto hit.’",
        "The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished\nto do. ’Would not you like,’ said he, ’to be a tailor?’ ’Oh, no!’ said\nthe young man; ’sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working\nbackwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.’\n’Oh!’ answered the man, ’that is not my sort of tailoring; come with\nme, and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.’ Not\nknowing what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring\nfrom the beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle,\nand said, ’You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or\nas hard as steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be\nseen.’",
        "After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four\nbrothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,\nset off towards their father’s home, where they told him all that had\nhappened to them, and how each had learned some craft.",
        "Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high\ntree, the father said, ’I should like to try what each of you can do\nin this way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ’At the top\nof this tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell me how many eggs there\nare in it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said,\n’Five.’ ’Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ’take away the eggs\nwithout letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them\nknow anything of what you are doing.’ So the cunning thief climbed up\nthe tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the\nbird; and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on\nat its ease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner\nof the table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman,\n’Cut all the eggs in two pieces at one shot.’ The huntsman took up his\nbow, and at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.",
        "’Now comes your turn,’ said he to the young tailor; ’sew the eggs and\nthe young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall\nhave done them no harm.’ Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed\nthe eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to\ntake them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its\nknowing it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few\ndays they crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their\nnecks, where the tailor had sewn them together.",
        "’Well done, sons!’ said the old man; ’you have made good use of your\ntime, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not\nknow which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come\nfor you to turn your skill to some account!’",
        "Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the\nking’s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king\nmourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever\nbrought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four\nbrothers said to each other, ’Here is a chance for us; let us try what\nwe can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not set the\nprincess free. ’I will soon find out where she is, however,’ said the\nstar-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ’I\nsee her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the\ndragon close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and asked\nfor a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over\nthe sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the\nprincess sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the\ndragon was lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ’I dare not shoot\nat him,’ said the huntsman, ’for I should kill the beautiful young\nlady also.’ ’Then I will try my skill,’ said the thief, and went and\nstole her away from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the\nbeast did not know it, but went on snoring.",
        "Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the\nship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air;\nfor he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat,\nand wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the\nhuntsman took up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so\nthat he fell down dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a\ngreat beast that in his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim\nin the open sea upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and\nwith a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat\ndown upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the\nboat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon\nready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe.",
        "When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great\nrejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ’One of you shall marry\nher, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’ Then\nthere arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ’If I had\nnot found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;\ntherefore she ought to be mine.’ ’Your seeing her would have been of\nno use,’ said the thief, ’if I had not taken her away from the dragon;\ntherefore she ought to be mine.’ ’No, she is mine,’ said the huntsman;\n’for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn\nyou and the princess into pieces.’ ’And if I had not sewn the boat\ntogether again,’ said the tailor, ’you would all have been drowned,\ntherefore she is mine.’ Then the king put in a word, and said, ’Each\nof you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way\nis for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody\nshe likes a great deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will\ngive each of you, as a reward for his skill, half a kingdom.’ So the\nbrothers agreed that this plan would be much better than either\nquarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have them. And the\nking then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived\nvery happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their\nfather; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let\neither the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again.",
        "A merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a\njourney; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should\nbring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for\njewels; but the third, who was called Lily, said, ’Dear father, bring\nme a rose.’ Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the\nmiddle of winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very\nfond of flowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he\nkissed all three, and bid them goodbye.",
        "And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and\njewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for\nthe rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing,\nthe people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew\nin snow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child;\nand as he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he\ncame to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half\nof which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On\none side the finest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other\neverything looked dreary and buried in the snow. ’A lucky hit!’ said\nhe, as he called to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed\nof roses that was there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.",
        "This done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce\nlion, and roared out, ’Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up\nalive!’ Then the man said, ’I knew not that the garden belonged to\nyou; can nothing save my life?’ ’No!’ said the lion, ’nothing, unless\nyou undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if\nyou agree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for\nyour daughter.’ But the man was unwilling to do so and said, ’It may\nbe my youngest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me\nwhen I go home.’ Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said,\n’It may perhaps be only a cat or a dog.’ And at last the man yielded\nwith a heavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion\nwhatever should meet him first on his return.",
        "And as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest\ndaughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed\nhim home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was\nstill more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to\nweep, saying, ’Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a\nhigh price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when\nhe has you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.’ Then he told her\nall that had happened, and said she should not go, let what would\nhappen.",
        "But she comforted him, and said, ’Dear father, the word you have given\nmust be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will\nlet me come safe home again.’",
        "The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of\nher father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the\nlion was an enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions,\nbut in the evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily\ncame to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to\nmarry him. The wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together\na long time. The prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came,\nand then he held his court; but every morning he left his bride, and\nwent away by himself, she knew not whither, till the night came again.",
        "After some time he said to her, ’Tomorrow there will be a great feast\nin your father’s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and\nif you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.’ Then\nshe rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and\nset out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for\nthey had thought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she\nwas, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the\nwood.",
        "Her second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to\ngo to the wedding, she said to the prince, ’I will not go alone this\ntime–you must go with me.’ But he would not, and said that it would\nbe a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light\nshould fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he\nshould be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world\nfor seven long years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she\nwould take care no light should fall upon him. So at last they set out\ntogether, and took with them their little child; and she chose a large\nhall with thick walls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were\nlighted; but, unluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the\ndoor. Then the wedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came\nfrom the church, and passed with the torches before the hall, a very\nsmall ray of light fell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared,\nand when his wife came in and looked for him, she found only a white\ndove; and it said to her, ’Seven years must I fly up and down over the\nface of the earth, but every now and then I will let fall a white\nfeather, that will show you the way I am going; follow it, and at last\nyou may overtake and set me free.’",
        "This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every\nnow and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to\njourney. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked\nneither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for\nseven years. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that\nthe time was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose\nwas still far off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the\nwhite feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see\nthe dove. ’Now,’ thought she to herself, ’no aid of man can be of use\nto me.’ So she went to the sun and said, ’Thou shinest everywhere, on\nthe hill’s top and the valley’s depth–hast thou anywhere seen my\nwhite dove?’ ’No,’ said the sun, ’I have not seen it; but I will give\nthee a casket–open it when thy hour of need comes.’",
        "So she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when\nthe moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ’Thou shinest through the\nnight, over field and grove–hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?’\n’No,’ said the moon, ’I cannot help thee but I will give thee an egg–\nbreak it when need comes.’",
        "Then she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and\nshe raised up her voice to it, and said, ’Thou blowest through every\ntree and under every leaf–hast thou not seen my white dove?’ ’No,’\nsaid the night-wind, ’but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they\nhave seen it.’ Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said\nthey too had not seen it, but the south wind said, ’I have seen the\nwhite dove–he has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into\na lion, for the seven years are passed away, and there he is fighting\nwith a dragon; and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to\nseparate him from you.’ Then the night-wind said, ’I will give thee\ncounsel. Go to the Red Sea; on the right shore stand many rods–count\nthem, and when thou comest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite\nthe dragon with it; and so the lion will have the victory, and both of\nthem will appear to you in their own forms. Then look round and thou\nwilt see a griffin, winged like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on\nto his back with thy beloved one as quickly as possible, and he will\ncarry you over the waters to your home. I will also give thee this\nnut,’ continued the night-wind. ’When you are half-way over, throw it\ndown, and out of the waters will immediately spring up a high nut-tree\non which the griffin will be able to rest, otherwise he would not have\nthe strength to bear you the whole way; if, therefore, thou dost\nforget to throw down the nut, he will let you both fall into the sea.’",
        "So our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had\nsaid; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the\nlion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But\nno sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized\nthe prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin’s back, and went\noff carrying the prince away with her.",
        "Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she\ntook heart and said, ’As far as the wind blows, and so long as the\ncock crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.’ She went\non for a long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither\nthe princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready,\nand she heard that the wedding was about to be held. ’Heaven aid me\nnow!’ said she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her,\nand found that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So\nshe put it on, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon\nher; and the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it\nwas to be sold. ’Not for gold and silver.’ said she, ’but for flesh\nand blood.’ The princess asked what she meant, and she said, ’Let me\nspeak with the bridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give\nthee the dress.’ At last the princess agreed, but she told her\nchamberlain to give the prince a sleeping draught, that he might not\nhear or see her. When evening came, and the prince had fallen asleep,\nshe was led into his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet,\nand said: ’I have followed thee seven years. I have been to the sun,\nthe moon, and the night-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped\nthee to overcome the dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?’ But the\nprince all the time slept so soundly, that her voice only passed over\nhim, and seemed like the whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.",
        "Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress;\nand when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a\nmeadow, and sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought\nherself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it,\nthere ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played\nabout, and then nestled under the old one’s wings, so as to form the\nmost beautiful sight in the world. And she rose up and drove them\nbefore her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so\npleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood.\n’Not for gold or silver, but for flesh and blood: let me again this\nevening speak with the bridegroom in his chamber, and I will give thee\nthe whole brood.’",
        "Then the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to what\nshe asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked the\nchamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the\nchamberlain told him all–how he had given him a sleeping draught, and\nhow a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was\nto come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the\nsleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what\nwoes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been,\nhe knew his beloved wife’s voice, and sprang up, and said, ’You have\nawakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a\nspell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven\nhath sent you to me in a lucky hour.’",
        "And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated\nthemselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea.\nWhen they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water,\nand immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the\ngriffin rested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There\nthey found their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after\nall their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their\ndays.",
        "A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to\nhim: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give\nhim nothing more to eat, and said, ’I want you no longer, so take\nyourself off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until\nyou are stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him\nadrift.",
        "The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the\nwood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain.\nPresently a fox met him: ’What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ’why\ndo you hang down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ’Ah!’\nreplied the horse, ’justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my\nmaster has forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and\nbecause I can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless\nI become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what\nchance can I have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk\nso.’",
        "However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ’I will help you;\nlie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be\ndead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the\nlion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ’A little way off\nlies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of\nhis carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately;\nand when they came to the horse, the fox said, ’You will not be able\nto eat him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what–I will tie you fast\nto his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at\nyour leisure.’",
        "This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the\nfox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs\ntogether and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he\ncould not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped\nthe horse on the shoulder, and said, ’Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he\nsprang, and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began\nto roar and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for\nfright; but the horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over\nthe fields to his master’s house.",
        "’Here he is, master,’ said he, ’I have got the better of him’: and\nwhen the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said.\n’Thou shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the\npoor old horse had plenty to eat, and lived–till he died.",
        "There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the\nking faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer\nbecause of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to\nhim: ’You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will\nnot receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me\nservice for them.’ Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living,\nwent away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the\nevening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light,\nwhich he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. ’Do\ngive me one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,’ said he\nto her, ’or I shall starve.’ ’Oho!’ she answered, ’who gives anything\nto a run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in,\nif you will do what I wish.’ ’What do you wish?’ said the soldier.\n’That you should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.’ The\nsoldier consented, and next day laboured with all his strength, but\ncould not finish it by the evening. ’I see well enough,’ said the\nwitch, ’that you can do no more today, but I will keep you yet another\nnight, in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood,\nand chop it small.’ The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and\nin the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more.\n’Tomorrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind\nmy house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it\nburns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again.’ Next\nday the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket.\nHe found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again.\nShe did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched\ndown her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him. ’No,’\nsaid he, perceiving her evil intention, ’I will not give you the light\nuntil I am standing with both feet upon the ground.’ The witch fell\ninto a passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away.",
        "The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue\nlight went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very\nwell that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very\nsorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco\npipe, which was still half full. ’This shall be my last pleasure,’\nthought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to\nsmoke. When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little\nblack dwarf stood before him, and said: ’Lord, what are your\ncommands?’ ’What my commands are?’ replied the soldier, quite\nastonished. ’I must do everything you bid me,’ said the little man.\n’Good,’ said the soldier; ’then in the first place help me out of this\nwell.’ The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an\nunderground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with\nhim. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had\ncollected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he\ncould carry. When he was above, he said to the little man: ’Now go and\nbind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.’ In a short time\nshe came by like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and screaming\nfrightfully. Nor was it long before the little man reappeared. ’It is\nall done,’ said he, ’and the witch is already hanging on the gallows.\nWhat further commands has my lord?’ inquired the dwarf. ’At this\nmoment, none,’ answered the soldier; ’you can return home, only be at\nhand immediately, if I summon you.’ ’Nothing more is needed than that\nyou should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before\nyou at once.’ Thereupon he vanished from his sight.",
        "The soldier returned to the town from which he come. He went to the\nbest inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord\nfurnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the\nsoldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black\nmanikin and said: ’I have served the king faithfully, but he has\ndismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my\nrevenge.’ ’What am I to do?’ asked the little man. ’Late at night,\nwhen the king’s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she\nshall do servant’s work for me.’ The manikin said: ’That is an easy\nthing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is\ndiscovered, you will fare ill.’ When twelve o’clock had struck, the\ndoor sprang open, and the manikin carried in the princess. ’Aha! are\nyou there?’ cried the soldier, ’get to your work at once! Fetch the\nbroom and sweep the chamber.’ When she had done this, he ordered her\nto come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said:\n’Pull off my boots,’ and then he threw them in her face, and made her\npick them up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did\neverything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-\nshut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the manikin carried her back to\nthe royal palace, and laid her in her bed.",
        "Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told\nhim that she had had a very strange dream. ’I was carried through the\nstreets with the rapidity of lightning,’ said she, ’and taken into a\nsoldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his\nroom, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a\ndream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.’\n’The dream may have been true,’ said the king. ’I will give you a\npiece of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole\nin the pocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall\nout and leave a track in the streets.’ But unseen by the king, the\nmanikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At\nnight when the sleeping princess was again carried through the\nstreets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made\nno track, for the crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in\nevery street there was. And again the princess was compelled to do\nservant’s work until cock-crow.",
        "Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it\nwas all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting,\npicking up peas, and saying: ’It must have rained peas, last night.’\n’We must think of something else,’ said the king; ’keep your shoes on\nwhen you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you\nare taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.’\nThe black manikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again\nordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him\nthat he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if\nthe shoe were found in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him.\n’Do what I bid you,’ replied the soldier, and again this third night\nthe princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went\naway, she hid her shoe under the bed.",
        "Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter’s\nshoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at\nthe entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought\nback, and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most\nvaluable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one\nducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at\nthe window of his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades\npassing by. The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man\ncame up, said to him: ’Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I\nhave left lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.’\nHis comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the\nsoldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black\nmanikin. ’Have no fear,’ said the latter to his master. ’Go\nwheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take\nthe blue light with you.’ Next day the soldier was tried, and though\nhe had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death. When he\nwas led forth to die, he begged a last favour of the king. ’What is\nit?’ asked the king. ’That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.’ ’You\nmay smoke three,’ answered the king, ’but do not imagine that I will\nspare your life.’ Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it\nat the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended,\nthe manikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said: ’What\ndoes my lord command?’ ’Strike down to earth that false judge there,\nand his constable, and spare not the king who has treated me so ill.’\nThen the manikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and\nthat way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to\nearth, and did not venture to stir again. The king was terrified; he\nthrew himself on the soldier’s mercy, and merely to be allowed to live\nat all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his daughter to wife.",
        "There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to\nrun alone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother\ncould not quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing\nthe ravens flying round the castle, she opened the window, and said:\n’I wish you were a raven and would fly away, then I should have a\nlittle peace.’ Scarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the\nchild in her arms was turned into a raven, and flew away from her\nthrough the open window. The bird took its flight to a dark wood and\nremained there for a long time, and meanwhile the parents could hear\nnothing of their child.",
        "Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he\nheard a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he\ndrew near, the raven said, ’I am by birth a king’s daughter, but am\nnow under the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me\nfree.’ ’What am I to do?’ he asked. She replied, ’Go farther into the\nwood until you come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will\noffer you food and drink, but you must not take of either; if you do,\nyou will fall into a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In\nthe garden behind the house is a large tan-heap, and on that you must\nstand and watch for me. I shall drive there in my carriage at two\no’clock in the afternoon for three successive days; the first day it\nwill be drawn by four white, the second by four chestnut, and the last\nby four black horses; but if you fail to keep awake and I find you\nsleeping, I shall not be set free.’",
        "The man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, ’Alas!\nI know even now that you will take something from the woman and be\nunable to save me.’ The man assured her again that he would on no\naccount touch a thing to eat or drink.",
        "When he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and\nsaid, ’Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give\nyou something to eat and drink.’",
        "’No,’ answered the man, ’I will neither eat not drink.’",
        "But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, ’If you will\nnot eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink\ncounts for nothing,’ and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded,\nand drank.",
        "As it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden\nand mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of\nfatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a\nlittle while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another\nminute his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a\ndeep sleep, that all the noises in the world would not have awakened\nhim. At two o’clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four\nwhite horses; but even before she reached the spot, she said to\nherself, sighing, ’I know he has fallen asleep.’ When she entered the\ngarden, there she found him as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap,\nfast asleep. She got out of her carriage and went to him; she called\nhim and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still continued\nsleeping.",
        "The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and\ndrink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent\nentreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank\nagain.",
        "Towards two o’clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to\nwatch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to\nfeel so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he\ncould not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast\nasleep. As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said\nsorrowfully to herself, ’I know he has fallen asleep.’ She went as\nbefore to look for him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken\nhim.",
        "The following day the old woman said to him, ’What is this? You are\nnot eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?’",
        "He answered, ’I may not and will not either eat or drink.’",
        "But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of\nhim, and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the\ntemptation, and took a deep draught.",
        "When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in\nthe garden to await the king’s daughter, but he felt even more\novercome with weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing\nhimself down, he slept like a log. At two o’clock the raven could be\nseen approaching, and this time her coachman and everything about her,\nas well as her horses, were black.",
        "She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ’I\nknow he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.’ She\nfound him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of\nno avail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a\nflask of wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they\nwould never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her\nname was engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his.\nFinally, she laid a letter near him, in which, after giving him\nparticulars of the food and drink she had left for him, she finished\nwith the following words: ’I see that as long as you remain here you\nwill never be able to set me free; if, however, you still wish to do\nso, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; this is well within your\npower to accomplish.’ She then returned to her carriage and drove to\nthe golden castle of Stromberg.",
        "When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved\nat heart, and said, ’She has no doubt been here and driven away again,\nand it is now too late for me to save her.’ Then his eyes fell on the\nthings which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from\nit all that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on\nhis way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in\nwhich direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in\nsearch of it and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went\non walking for fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once\nmore the night came on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell\nasleep. Again the next day he pursued his way through the forest, and\nthat evening, thinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he\nheard such a howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep.\nHe waited till it was darker and people had begun to light up their\nhouses, and then seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards\nit.",
        "He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it\nreally was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense\ngiant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ’If the giant\nsees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’ However, after a\nwhile he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,\nhe called out, ’It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had\nanything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.’ ’I\nwould rather you let that alone,’ said the man, ’for I do not\nwillingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have\nenough to satisfy your hunger.’ ’If that is so,’ replied the giant, ’I\nwill leave you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had\nnothing else.’",
        "So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out\nthe bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of\nthem, were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good\ncheer, and ate and drank to his heart’s content. When he had finished\nhis supper the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of\nStromberg. The giant said, ’I will look on my map; on it are marked\nall the towns, villages, and houses.’ So he fetched his map, and\nlooked for the castle, but could not find it. ’Never mind,’ he said,\n’I have larger maps upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,’\nbut they searched in vain, for the castle was not marked even on\nthese. The man now thought he should like to continue his journey, but\nthe giant begged him to remain for a day or two longer until the\nreturn of his brother, who was away in search of provisions. When the\nbrother came home, they asked him about the castle of Stromberg, and\nhe told them he would look on his own maps as soon as he had eaten and\nappeased his hunger. Accordingly, when he had finished his supper,\nthey all went up together to his room and looked through his maps, but\nthe castle was not to be found. Then he fetched other older maps, and\nthey went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but\nit was many thousand miles away. ’How shall I be able to get there?’\nasked the man. ’I have two hours to spare,’ said the giant, ’and I\nwill carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I must then\nreturn to look after the child who is in our care.’",
        "The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred\nleagues of the castle, where he left him, saying, ’You will be able to\nwalk the remainder of the way yourself.’ The man journeyed on day and\nnight till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it\nsituated, however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot\nhe saw the enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside.\nHe was overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the\nmountain, but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted\nto climb he fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to\nreach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, ’I will remain\nhere and wait for her,’ so he built himself a little hut, and there he\nsat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king’s\ndaughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer\nto her.",
        "Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he\ncalled out to them, ’God be with you.’ They stopped when they heard\nthe call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with\ntheir fighting, which now became more furious. ’God be with you,’ he\ncried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one\nwent back to their fighting. A third time he called out, ’God be with\nyou,’ and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute\nbetween the three men, he went out and asked them why they were\nfighting so angrily with one another. One of them said that he had\nfound a stick, and that he had but to strike it against any door\nthrough which he wished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another\ntold him that he had found a cloak which rendered its wearer\ninvisible; and the third had caught a horse which would carry its\nrider over any obstacle, and even up the glass mountain. They had been\nunable to decide whether they would keep together and have the things\nin common, or whether they would separate. On hearing this, the man\nsaid, ’I will give you something in exchange for those three things;\nnot money, for that I have not got, but something that is of far more\nvalue. I must first, however, prove whether all you have told me about\nyour three things is true.’ The robbers, therefore, made him get on\nthe horse, and handed him the stick and the cloak, and when he had put\nthis round him he was no longer visible. Then he fell upon them with\nthe stick and beat them one after another, crying, ’There, you idle\nvagabonds, you have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!’",
        "After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of\nthe castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,\nand it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the\nsteps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden\ngoblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he\nstill wore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his\nfinger, and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched\nthe bottom. ’That is my own ring,’ she exclaimed, ’and if that is so\nthe man must also be here who is coming to set me free.’",
        "She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.\nMeanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown\noff the cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him,\nand cried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms;\nand she kissed him, and said, ’Now you have indeed set me free, and\ntomorrow we will celebrate our marriage.’",
        "There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called\nDummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every\noccasion.",
        "It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,\nand before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a\nbottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or\nthirst.",
        "When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who\nbade him good day, and said: ’Do give me a piece of cake out of your\npocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and\nthirsty.’ But the clever son answered: ’If I give you my cake and\nwine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the\nlittle man standing and went on.",
        "But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a\nfalse stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go\nhome and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’s doing.",
        "After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave\nhim, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey\nman met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of\nwine. But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ’What I give you\nwill be taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man\nstanding and went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when\nhe had made a few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so\nthat he had to be carried home.",
        "Then Dummling said: ’Father, do let me go and cut wood.’ The father\nanswered: ’Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,\nyou do not understand anything about it.’ But Dummling begged so long\nthat at last he said: ’Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting\nyourself.’ His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the\ncinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.",
        "When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,\nand greeting him, said: ’Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out\nof your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ Dummling answered: ’I\nhave only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit\ndown and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his\ncinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become\ngood wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said:\n’Since you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have,\nI will give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and\nyou will find something at the roots.’ Then the little man took leave\nof him.",
        "Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a\ngoose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her\nup, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would\nstay the night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose\nand were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and\nwould have liked to have one of its golden feathers.",
        "The eldest thought: ’I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a\nfeather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by\nthe wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.",
        "The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a\nfeather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she\nwas held fast.",
        "At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others\nscreamed out: ’Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But she did\nnot understand why she was to keep away. ’The others are there,’ she\nthought, ’I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as\nshe had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they\nhad to spend the night with the goose.",
        "The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,\nwithout troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to\nit. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now\nright, wherever his legs took him.",
        "In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the\nprocession he said: ’For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are\nyou running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?’\nAt the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull\nher away, but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and\nwas himself obliged to run behind.",
        "Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running\nbehind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: ’Hi!\nyour reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a\nchristening today!’ and running after him he took him by the sleeve,\nbut was also held fast to it.",
        "Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers\ncame with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them\nand begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had\nscarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there\nwere seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.",
        "Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a\ndaughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he\nhad put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh\nshould marry her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and\nall her train before the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the\nseven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to\nlaugh quite loudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling\nasked to have her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-\nlaw, and made all manner of excuses and said he must first produce a\nman who could drink a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the\nlittle grey man, who could certainly help him; so he went into the\nforest, and in the same place where he had felled the tree, he saw a\nman sitting, who had a very sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he\nwas taking to heart so sorely, and he answered: ’I have such a great\nthirst and cannot quench it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of\nwine I have just emptied, but that to me is like a drop on a hot\nstone!’",
        "’There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ’just come with me and you\nshall be satisfied.’",
        "He led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge\nbarrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day\nwas out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more\nfor his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom\neveryone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a\nnew condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain\nof bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the\nforest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his\nbody with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ’I have eaten\na whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a\nhunger as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I\nam not to die of hunger.’",
        "At this Dummling was glad, and said: ’Get up and come with me; you\nshall eat yourself full.’ He led him to the king’s palace where all\nthe flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a\nhuge mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood\nbefore it, began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain\nhad vanished. Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride;\nbut the king again sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could\nsail on land and on water. ’As soon as you come sailing back in it,’\nsaid he, ’you shall have my daughter for wife.’",
        "Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey\nman to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,\nhe said: ’Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you\nthe ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.’ Then he\ngave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the\nking saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his\ndaughter. The wedding was celebrated, and after the king’s death,\nDummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly\nwith his wife.",

        "Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great\nway off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill–so\nill that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved\nat their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together very\nmournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and\nasked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very\nill, and that they were afraid nothing could save him. ’I know what\nwould,’ said the little old man; ’it is the Water of Life. If he could\nhave a draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to\nget.’ Then the eldest son said, ’I will soon find it’: and he went to\nthe sick king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of\nLife, as it was the only thing that could save him. ’No,’ said the\nking. ’I had rather die than place you in such great danger as you\nmust meet with in your journey.’ But he begged so hard that the king\nlet him go; and the prince thought to himself, ’If I bring my father\nthis water, he will make me sole heir to his kingdom.’",
        "Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to\na deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around,\nhe saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf,\nwith a sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him\nand said, ’Prince, whither so fast?’ ’What is that to thee, you ugly\nimp?’ said the prince haughtily, and rode on.",
        "But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of\nill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became\nnarrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he\ncould not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his\nhorse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing\nround him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he\nwas shut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his\nway on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found\nhimself unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide\nspellbound.",
        "Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s\nreturn, till at last the second son said, ’Father, I will go in search\nof the Water of Life.’ For he thought to himself, ’My brother is\nsurely dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.’ The\nking was at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to\nhis wish. So he set out and followed the same road which his brother\nhad done, and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot\nin the mountains, saying, as before, ’Prince, prince, whither so\nfast?’ ’Mind your own affairs, busybody!’ said the prince scornfully,\nand rode on.",
        "But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder\nbrother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the\nheart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think\nthemselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take\nadvice.",
        "When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest\nson said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he\nshould soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and\nthe dwarf met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the\nmountains, and said, ’Prince, whither so fast?’ And the prince said,\n’I am going in search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill,\nand like to die: can you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you\ncan!’ ’Do you know where it is to be found?’ asked the dwarf. ’No,’\nsaid the prince, ’I do not. Pray tell me if you know.’ ’Then as you\nhave spoken to me kindly, and are wise enough to seek for advice, I\nwill tell you how and where to go. The water you seek springs from a\nwell in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in\nsafety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread;\nstrike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it\nwill open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their\nprey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then\nhasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the\nclock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon\nyou for ever.’",
        "Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for\nhis friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling\non and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end,\nand found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew\nopen at the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted\nhe went on through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall.\nAround it he saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled\noff their rings and put them on his own fingers. In another room he\nsaw on a table a sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took.\nFurther on he came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a\ncouch; and she welcomed him joyfully, and said, if he would set her\nfree from the spell that bound her, the kingdom should be his, if he\nwould come back in a year and marry her. Then she told him that the\nwell that held the Water of Life was in the palace gardens; and bade\nhim make haste, and draw what he wanted before the clock struck\ntwelve.",
        "He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a\ndelightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to\nhimself, as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and\ngaze on the lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and\nsleep fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the\nclock was striking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch\ndreadfully frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing\nby him full of water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was\ngoing out of the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so\nquickly upon him that it snapped off a piece of his heel.",
        "When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got\nthe Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed\nby the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said,\n’You have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay\nwhole armies, and the bread will never fail you.’ Then the prince\nthought to himself, ’I cannot go home to my father without my\nbrothers’; so he said, ’My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my\ntwo brothers are, who set out in search of the Water of Life before\nme, and never came back?’ ’I have shut them up by a charm between two\nmountains,’ said the dwarf, ’because they were proud and ill-behaved,\nand scorned to ask advice.’ The prince begged so hard for his\nbrothers, that the dwarf at last set them free, though unwillingly,\nsaying, ’Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.’ Their brother,\nhowever, was greatly rejoiced to see them, and told them all that had\nhappened to him; how he had found the Water of Life, and had taken a\ncup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful princess free from a\nspell that bound her; and how she had engaged to wait a whole year,\nand then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.",
        "Then they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a\ncountry that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it\nwas feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the\nland the bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king\nthe wonderful sword, and he slew the enemy’s army with it; and thus\nthe kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he\nbefriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.",
        "When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their\nvoyage the two eldest said to themselves, ’Our brother has got the\nwater which we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us\nand give him the kingdom, which is our right’; so they were full of\nenvy and revenge, and agreed together how they could ruin him. Then\nthey waited till he was fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out\nof the cup, and took it for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water\ninstead.",
        "When they came to their journey’s end, the youngest son brought his\ncup to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely,\nhowever, had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even\nthan he was before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed\nthe youngest for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison\ntheir father, but that they had found the Water of Life, and had\nbrought it with them. He no sooner began to drink of what they brought\nhim, than he felt his sickness leave him, and was as strong and well\nas in his younger days. Then they went to their brother, and laughed\nat him, and said, ’Well, brother, you found the Water of Life, did\nyou? You have had the trouble and we shall have the reward. Pray, with\nall your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your eyes open?\nNext year one of us will take away your beautiful princess, if you do\nnot take care. You had better say nothing about this to our father,\nfor he does not believe a word you say; and if you tell tales, you\nshall lose your life into the bargain: but be quiet, and we will let\nyou off.’",
        "The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought\nthat he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his\ncourt together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he\nought to be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going\non, till one day, when the king’s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with\nhim, and they were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so\nsorrowful that the prince said, ’My friend, what is the matter with\nyou?’ ’I cannot and dare not tell you,’ said he. But the prince begged\nvery hard, and said, ’Only tell me what it is, and do not think I\nshall be angry, for I will forgive you.’ ’Alas!’ said the huntsman;\n’the king has ordered me to shoot you.’ The prince started at this,\nand said, ’Let me live, and I will change dresses with you; you shall\ntake my royal coat to show to my father, and do you give me your\nshabby one.’ ’With all my heart,’ said the huntsman; ’I am sure I\nshall be glad to save you, for I could not have shot you.’ Then he\ntook the prince’s coat, and gave him the shabby one, and went away\nthrough the wood.",
        "Some time after, three grand embassies came to the old king’s court,\nwith rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now\nall these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword\nand loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their\npeople. This touched the old king’s heart, and he thought his son\nmight still be guiltless, and said to his court, ’O that my son were\nstill alive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!’ ’He is still\nalive,’ said the huntsman; ’and I am glad that I had pity on him, but\nlet him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.’ At this the\nking was overwhelmed with joy, and made it known thoughout all his\nkingdom, that if his son would come back to his court he would forgive\nhim.",
        "Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should\ncome back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining\ngold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode\nstraight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they\nmust let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure\nwas not the right one; and that they must send him away at once.",
        "The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make\nhaste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set\nher free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom\nwith her. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he\nstopped to look at it, and he thought to himself, ’It is a pity to\nride upon this beautiful road’; so he turned aside and rode on the\nright-hand side of it. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who\nhad seen the road he took, said to him, he could not be what he said\nhe was, and must go about his business.",
        "The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when\nhe came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it, he\nstopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to\nhimself, ’What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’ Then he\ntoo turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to\nthe gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too\nmust go away about his business; and away he went.",
        "Now when the full year was come round, the third brother left the\nforest in which he had lain hid for fear of his father’s anger, and\nset out in search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking\nof her all the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what\nthe road was made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as\nhe came to the gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with\njoy, and said he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and\nlord of the kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the\nprincess told him she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and\nof his wish to have him home again: so, before his wedding with the\nprincess, he went to visit his father, taking her with him. Then he\ntold him everything; how his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and\nyet that he had borne all those wrongs for the love of his father. And\nthe old king was very angry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but\nthey made their escape, and got into a ship and sailed away over the\nwide sea, and where they went to nobody knew and nobody cared.",
        "And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his\nkingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.\nAnd young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once\non the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the\nsugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.",
        "  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.\n  And all the good people they danced and they sung,\n  And feasted and frolick’d I can’t tell how long.",
        "There was once a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much.\nAnd when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his\nfather lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before\nhis end. Then he said to his beloved: ’I must now go and leave you, I\ngive you a ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return\nand fetch you.’ So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the\nlatter was dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: ’Dear\nson, I wished to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry\nas I wish,’ and he named a certain king’s daughter who was to be his\nwife. The son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was\ndoing, and said: ’Yes, dear father, your will shall be done,’ and\nthereupon the king shut his eyes, and died.",
        "When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of\nmourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had\ngiven his father, and caused the king’s daughter to be asked in\nmarriage, and she was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of\nthis, and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died.\nThen her father said to her: ’Dearest child, why are you so sad? You\nshall have whatsoever you will.’ She thought for a moment and said:\n’Dear father, I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face,\nfigure, and size.’ The father said: ’If it be possible, your desire\nshall be fulfilled,’ and he caused a search to be made in his whole\nkingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly resembled\nhis daughter in face, figure, and size.",
        "When they came to the king’s daughter, she had twelve suits of\nhuntsmen’s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put\non the huntsmen’s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.\nThereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them,\nand rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so\ndearly. Then she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would\ntake all of them into his service. The king looked at her and did not\nknow her, but as they were such handsome fellows, he said: ’Yes,’ and\nthat he would willingly take them, and now they were the king’s twelve\nhuntsmen.",
        "The king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew\nall concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he\nsaid to the king: ’You think you have twelve huntsmen?’ ’Yes,’ said\nthe king, ’they are twelve huntsmen.’ The lion continued: ’You are\nmistaken, they are twelve girls.’ The king said: ’That cannot be true!\nHow will you prove that to me?’ ’Oh, just let some peas be strewn in\nthe ante-chamber,’ answered the lion, ’and then you will soon see.\nMen have a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir,\nbut girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll\nabout.’ The king was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the\npeas to be strewn.",
        "There was, however, a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen,\nand when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went\nto them and repeated everything, and said: ’The lion wants to make the\nking believe that you are girls.’ Then the king’s daughter thanked\nhim, and said to her maidens: ’Show some strength, and step firmly on\nthe peas.’ So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen\ncalled before him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas\nwere lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong,\nsure walk, that not one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then\nthey went away again, and the king said to the lion: ’You have lied to\nme, they walk just like men.’ The lion said: ’They have been informed\nthat they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed some\nstrength. Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-\nchamber, and they will go to them and be pleased with them, and that\nis what no man would do.’ The king liked the advice, and had the\nspinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.",
        "But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,\nand disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king’s daughter\nsaid to her eleven girls: ’Show some constraint, and do not look round\nat the spinning-wheels.’ And next morning when the king had his twelve\nhuntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once\nlooked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion:\n’You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the\nspinning-wheels.’ The lion replied: ’They have restrained themselves.’\nThe king, however, would no longer believe the lion.",
        "The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his\nliking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that once\nwhen they were out hunting, news came that the king’s bride was\napproaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that\nher heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The\nking thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to\nhim, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring\nwhich he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face\nhe recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her,\nand when she opened her eyes he said: ’You are mine, and I am yours,\nand no one in the world can alter that.’ He sent a messenger to the\nother bride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he\nhad a wife already, and someone who had just found an old key did not\nrequire a new one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion\nwas again taken into favour, because, after all, he had told the\ntruth.",
        "There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very\nyoung, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships\nthen making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his\nwealth, in the hope of making great gains, when the news came that\nboth were lost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so\nvery poor that nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and\nthere he often went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind\nof a little of his trouble.",
        "One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no\ngreat comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to\nbe, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking,\nblack dwarf. ’Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?’ said he to the\nmerchant; ’what is it you take so deeply to heart?’ ’If you would do\nme any good I would willingly tell you,’ said the merchant. ’Who knows\nbut I may?’ said the little man: ’tell me what ails you, and perhaps\nyou will find I may be of some use.’ Then the merchant told him how\nall his wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had\nnothing left but that little plot of land. ’Oh, trouble not yourself\nabout that,’ said the dwarf; ’only undertake to bring me here, twelve\nyears hence, whatever meets you first on your going home, and I will\ngive you as much as you please.’ The merchant thought this was no\ngreat thing to ask; that it would most likely be his dog or his cat,\nor something of that sort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he\nagreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to do what was\nasked of him.",
        "But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that\nhe crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in\nhis face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and\nhorror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no\ngold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a\njoke that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the\nmoney came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.",
        "About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look\nfor some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and\nthere, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the\nfloor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about\nhis son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than\nbefore.",
        "Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years\ndrew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very\nsad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his\nface. The boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would\nnot tell for some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without\nknowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf,\nand that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his\nword. Then Heinel said, ’Father, give yourself very little trouble\nabout that; I shall be too much for the little man.’",
        "When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place\nagreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself\nand his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came,\nand walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any\nway to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over\nit. At last the boy said to him. ’Have you anything to say to us, my\nfriend, or what do you want?’ Now Heinel had found a friend in a good\nfairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this\nfairy knew what good luck was in store for him. ’Have you brought me\nwhat you said you would?’ said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man\nheld his tongue, but Heinel said again, ’What do you want here?’ The\ndwarf said, ’I come to talk with your father, not with you.’ ’You have\ncheated and taken in my father,’ said the son; ’pray give him up his\nbond at once.’ ’Fair and softly,’ said the little old man; ’right is\nright; I have paid my money, and your father has had it, and spent it;\nso be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.’ ’You must have my\nconsent to that first,’ said Heinel, ’so please to step in here, and\nlet us talk it over.’ The old man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if\nhe should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could. Then\nat last, after a long talk, they came to terms. Heinel agreed that his\nfather must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have his\nway: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune\nwas in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not\nchoose to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious\nfor his company.",
        "So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that\nHeinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard\nby; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he\nshould thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind\nand weather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the\nboat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one\nside low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was\nlost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way,\nthinking that at any rate he had had his revenge.",
        "The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her\nfriend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The\nyoung man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an\nunknown land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a\nbeautiful castle but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted.\n’Here,’ said he to himself, ’must I find the prize the good fairy told\nme of.’ So he once more searched the whole palace through, till at\nlast he found a white snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of\nthe chambers.",
        "Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad\nto see him, and said, ’Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve\nlong years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she\npromised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come:\ntheir faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.\nThey will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do\nwhat they will–beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you–bear all;\nonly speak not a word, and at twelve o’clock they must go away. The\nsecond night twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four,\nwho will even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night\ntheir power is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you\nthe Water of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to\nlife and health.’ And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore\nall, and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and\nfell on his neck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth\nthroughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned\nking of the Golden Mountain.",
        "They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus\neight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his\nfather; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was\nagainst his going, and said, ’I know well that misfortunes will come\nupon us if you go.’ However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At\nhis going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, ’Take this ring,\nand put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only\npromise never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father’s\nhouse.’ Then he said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on\nhis finger, and wished himself near the town where his father lived.",
        "Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would\nnot let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to\na neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old\nfrock, and thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his\nfather’s house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not\nbelieve him, and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he\nknew was long since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor\nshepherd, he would not even give him anything to eat. The king,\nhowever, still vowed that he was his son, and said, ’Is there no mark\nby which you would know me if I am really your son?’ ’Yes,’ said his\nmother, ’our Heinel had a mark like a raspberry on his right arm.’\nThen he showed them the mark, and they knew that what he had said was\ntrue.",
        "He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was\nmarried to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant\nsaid, ’that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels\nabout in a shepherd’s frock!’ At this the son was vexed; and forgetting\nhis word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an\ninstant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had\nbroken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to\nsoothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in\ntruth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.",
        "One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her\nthe spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he\nsat himself down, and said, ’I am very much tired; sit by me, I will\nrest my head in your lap, and sleep a while.’ As soon as he had fallen\nasleep, however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly\naway, and wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And\nwhen he awoke he found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone\nfrom his finger. ’I can never go back to my father’s house,’ said he;\n’they would say I am a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world,\ntill I come again to my kingdom.’",
        "So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three\ngiants were sharing their father’s goods; and as they saw him pass\nthey cried out and said, ’Little men have sharp wits; he shall part\nthe goods between us.’ Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy’s\nhead whenever the wearer gave the words, ’Heads off!’; a cloak that\nmade the owner invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair\nof boots that carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they\nmust first let him try these wonderful things, then he might know how\nto set a value upon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished\nhimself a fly, and in a moment he was a fly. ’The cloak is very well,’\nsaid he: ’now give me the sword.’ ’No,’ said they; ’not unless you\nundertake not to say, “Heads off!” for if you do we are all dead men.’\nSo they gave it him, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked\nfor the boots also; and the moment he had all three in his power, he\nwished himself at the Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So\nthe giants were left behind with no goods to share or quarrel about.",
        "As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and\nthe people around told him that his queen was about to marry another\nhusband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the\ncastle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one\nsaw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it\naway and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her,\nhe took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat\nand drink, her plate and cup were always empty.",
        "Upon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her\nchamber alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there.\n’Alas!’ said she to herself, ’was I not once set free? Why then does\nthis enchantment still seem to bind me?’",
        "’False and fickle one!’ said he. ’One indeed came who set thee free,\nand he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to\nhave had such treatment from thee?’ Then he went out and sent away the\ncompany, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back\nto the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.\nHowever, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them\nif they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried\nto seize him; but he drew his sword. ’Heads Off!’ cried he; and with\nthe word the traitors’ heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more\nking of the Golden Mountain.",
        "There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with\ntwo oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two\ntalers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened\nthat the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how\nwell he ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would\nwillingly have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and\nat length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ’Oh, yes,’ said\nthe doctor, ’that is soon managed.’ ’What must I do?’ asked the\npeasant. ’In the first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind\nwhich has a cock on the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart\nand your two oxen into money, and get yourself some clothes, and\nwhatsoever else pertains to medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for\nyourself with the words: “I am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed\nup above your house-door.’ The peasant did everything that he had been\ntold to do. When he had doctored people awhile, but not long, a rich\nand great lord had some money stolen. Then he was told about Doctor\nKnowall who lived in such and such a village, and must know what had\nbecome of the money. So the lord had the horses harnessed to his\ncarriage, drove out to the village, and asked Crabb if he were Doctor\nKnowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was to go with him and bring\nback the stolen money. ’Oh, yes, but Grete, my wife, must go too.’ The\nlord was willing, and let both of them have a seat in the carriage,\nand they all drove away together. When they came to the nobleman’s\ncastle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to sit down and eat.\n’Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated himself with\nher at the table. And when the first servant came with a dish of\ndelicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ’Grete, that was\nthe first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first dish.\nThe servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ’That is the\nfirst thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to\nhis comrade outside: ’The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said\nI was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was\nforced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,\nand said: ’Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally\nalarmed, and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no\nbetter, for the peasant again said: ’Grete, that is the third.’ The\nfourth had to carry in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the\ndoctor that he was to show his skill, and guess what was beneath the\ncover. Actually, there were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had\nno idea what to say, and cried: ’Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard\nthat, he cried: ’There! he knows it; he must also know who has the\nmoney!’",
        "On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the\ndoctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When\ntherefore he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had\nstolen the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and\ngive him a heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them,\nfor if he did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the\nmoney was concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned\nto the hall, sat down to the table, and said: ’My lord, now will I\nsearch in my book where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant,\nhowever, crept into the stove to hear if the doctor knew still more.\nBut the doctor sat still and opened his A B C book, turned the pages\nbackwards and forwards, and looked for the cock. As he could not find\nit immediately he said: ’I know you are there, so you had better come\nout!’ Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him,\nand full of terror, sprang out, crying: ’That man knows everything!’\nThen Doctor Knowall showed the lord where the money was, but did not\nsay who had stolen it, and received from both sides much money in\nreward, and became a renowned man.",
        "There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.\nAlthough the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small\nthat they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once\nbe christened.",
        "So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some\nwater, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at\ndrawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their\npitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at\none another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In\nthe meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the\nyoung men stay so long. ’Surely,’ said he, ’the whole seven must have\nforgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited\nstill longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished\nthem all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when\nhe heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens\nas black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his\nwish so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone,\nand comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven\nsons with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every\nday more beautiful.",
        "For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers;\nfor her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her:\nbut one day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them.\n’Yes,’ said they, ’she is beautiful indeed, but still ’tis a pity that\nher brothers should have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much\ngrieved, and went to her father and mother, and asked if she had any\nbrothers, and what had become of them. So they dared no longer hide\nthe truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven, and that her\nbirth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned\nsadly about it every day, and thought herself bound to do all she\ncould to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease,\ntill at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world\nto find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever\nit might cost her.",
        "She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and\nmother had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a\nlittle pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little\nstool to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on,\nand journeyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the\nsun, but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away\nquickly to the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ’I\nsmell flesh and blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry\nand came to the stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her,\nand each star sat upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose\nup and gave her a little piece of wood, and said, ’If you have not\nthis little piece of wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on\nthe glass-mountain, and there your brothers live.’ The little girl\ntook the piece of wood, rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on\nagain until she came to the glass-mountain, and found the door shut.\nThen she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the\ncloth it was not there, and she saw she had lost the gift of the good\nstars. What was to be done? She wanted to save her brothers, and had\nno key of the castle of the glass-mountain; so this faithful little\nsister took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger,\nthat was just the size of the piece of wood she had lost, and put it\nin the door and opened it.",
        "As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ’What are you\nseeking for?’ ’I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’ answered\nshe. Then the dwarf said, ’My masters are not at home; but if you will\nwait till they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting\ntheir dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little\nplates, and their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the\ntable, and out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece,\nand out of each little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the\nring that she had brought with her fall into the last glass.",
        "On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the\ndwarf said, ’Here come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to\neat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then\nsaid one after the other,",
        "’Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of\nmy little glass?’",
        " ’Caw! Caw! well I ween\n  Mortal lips have this way been.’",
        "When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the\nring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s,\nand said, ’O that our little sister would but come! then we should be\nfree.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door\nall the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all the\nravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each\nother, and went merrily home.",
        "FIRST STORY",
        "There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed\nthat his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the\ntest. He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb,\nand behaved as if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room,\nshut herself in, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the\ncooking. When it became known that the old fox was dead, suitors\npresented themselves. The maid heard someone standing at the house-\ndoor, knocking. She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who\nsaid:",
        " ’What may you be about, Miss Cat?\n  Do you sleep or do you wake?’",
        "She answered:",
        " ’I am not sleeping, I am waking,\n  Would you know what I am making?\n  I am boiling warm beer with butter,\n  Will you be my guest for supper?’",
        "’No, thank you, miss,’ said the fox, ’what is Mrs Fox doing?’ The maid\nreplied:",
        " ’She is sitting in her room,\n  Moaning in her gloom,\n  Weeping her little eyes quite red,\n  Because old Mr Fox is dead.’",
        "’Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to\nwoo her.’ ’Certainly, young sir.’",
        "  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,\n  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,\n ’Mistress Fox, are you inside?’\n ’Oh, yes, my little cat,’ she cried.\n ’A wooer he stands at the door out there.’\n ’What does he look like, my dear?’",
        "’Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?’ ’Oh, no,’\nanswered the cat, ’he has only one.’ ’Then I will not have him.’",
        "Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards\nthere was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to\nwoo Mrs Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the\nfirst. After this still more came, each with one tail more than the\nother, but they were all turned away, until at last one came who had\nnine tails, like old Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said\njoyfully to the cat:",
        " ’Now open the gates and doors all wide,\n  And carry old Mr Fox outside.’",
        "But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred\nunder the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs\nFox out of the house.",
        "When old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at\nthe door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him.\nThe wolf greeted her, and said:",
        " ’Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,\n  How comes it that alone you sit?\n  What are you making good?’",
        "The cat replied:",
        " ’In milk I’m breaking bread so sweet,\n  Will you be my guest, and eat?’",
        "’No, thank you, Mrs Cat,’ answered the wolf. ’Is Mrs Fox not at home?’",
        "The cat said:",
        " ’She sits upstairs in her room,\n  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,\n  Bewailing her trouble so sore,\n  For old Mr Fox is no more.’",
        "The wolf answered:",
        " ’If she’s in want of a husband now,\n  Then will it please her to step below?’\n  The cat runs quickly up the stair,\n  And lets her tail fly here and there,\n  Until she comes to the parlour door.\n  With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:\n ’Are you within, good Mistress Fox?\n  If you’re in want of a husband now,\n  Then will it please you to step below?",
        "Mrs Fox asked: ’Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a\npointed mouth?’ ’No,’ answered the cat. ’Then he won’t do for me.’",
        "When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion,\nand all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the\ngood qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and\nthe cat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a\nyoung fox. Then Mrs Fox said: ’Has the gentleman red stockings on, and\nhas a little pointed mouth?’ ’Yes,’ said the cat, ’he has.’ ’Then let\nhim come upstairs,’ said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare\nthe wedding feast.",
        " ’Sweep me the room as clean as you can,\n  Up with the window, fling out my old man!\n  For many a fine fat mouse he brought,\n  Yet of his wife he never thought,\n  But ate up every one he caught.’",
        "Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much\nrejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing\nstill.",
        "As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood,\nthere came up a little old woman, and said to him, ’Good day, good\nday; you seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give\nme something to eat.’ The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand\nin his pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way;\nbut she took hold of him, and said, ’Listen, my friend, to what I am\ngoing to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way,\nand after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see\nnine birds sitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one\nwill fall down dead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a\nwishing-cloak, and when you wear it you will find yourself at any\nplace where you may wish to be. Cut open the dead bird, take out its\nheart and keep it, and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow\nevery morning when you rise. It is the bird’s heart that will bring\nyou this good luck.’",
        "The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ’If all this does\nhappen, it will be a fine thing for me.’ When he had gone a hundred\nsteps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over\nhim, and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their\nbills and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if\neach wished to have it himself. ’Well,’ said the huntsman, ’this is\nwonderful; this happens just as the old woman said’; then he shot into\nthe midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the\nflock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.\nThen the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird,\ntook out the heart, and carried the cloak home with him.",
        "The next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay\nthe piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day,\nand indeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold,\nand at last thought to himself, ’Of what use is this gold to me whilst\nI am at home? I will go out into the world and look about me.’",
        "Then he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his\nneck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led\nthrough a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a\ngreen meadow, and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very\nbeautiful young lady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman\nwas a witch, and said to the young lady, ’There is a young man coming\nout of the wood who carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away\nfrom him, my dear child, for it is more fit for us than for him. He\nhas a bird’s heart that brings a piece of gold under his pillow every\nmorning.’ Meantime the huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady,\nand said to himself, ’I have been travelling so long that I should\nlike to go into this castle and rest myself, for I have money enough\nto pay for anything I want’; but the real reason was, that he wanted\nto see more of the beautiful lady. Then he went into the house, and\nwas welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love\nthat he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady’s eyes, and\ndoing everything that she wished. Then the old woman said, ’Now is the\ntime for getting the bird’s heart.’ So the lady stole it away, and he\nnever found any more gold under his pillow, for it lay now under the\nyoung lady’s, and the old woman took it away every morning; but he was\nso much in love that he never missed his prize.",
        "’Well,’ said the old witch, ’we have got the bird’s heart, but not the\nwishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.’ ’Let us leave him\nthat,’ said the young lady; ’he has already lost his wealth.’ Then the\nwitch was very angry, and said, ’Such a cloak is a very rare and\nwonderful thing, and I must and will have it.’ So she did as the old\nwoman told her, and set herself at the window, and looked about the\ncountry and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, ’What makes\nyou so sad?’ ’Alas! dear sir,’ said she, ’yonder lies the granite rock\nwhere all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there,\nthat whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can\nreach it? only the birds and the flies–man cannot.’ ’If that’s all\nyour grief,’ said the huntsman, ’I’ll take there with all my heart’;\nso he drew her under his cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the\ngranite mountain they were both there. The diamonds glittered so on\nall sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the\nfinest. But the old witch made a deep sleep come upon him, and he said\nto the young lady, ’Let us sit down and rest ourselves a little, I am\nso tired that I cannot stand any longer.’ So they sat down, and he\nlaid his head in her lap and fell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping\non she took the cloak from his shoulders, hung it on her own, picked\nup the diamonds, and wished herself home again.",
        "When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him\nalone on the wild rock, he said, ’Alas! what roguery there is in the\nworld!’ and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to\ndo. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as\nhe saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, ’I can\nonly save myself by feigning to be asleep’; so he laid himself down as\nif he were in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first\npushed him with his foot, and said, ’What worm is this that lies here\ncurled up?’ ’Tread upon him and kill him,’ said the second. ’It’s not\nworth the trouble,’ said the third; ’let him live, he’ll go climbing\nhigher up the mountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him\naway.’ And they passed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said;\nand as soon as they were gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain,\nand when he had sat there a short time a cloud came rolling around\nhim, and caught him in a whirlwind and bore him along for some time,\ntill it settled in a garden, and he fell quite gently to the ground\namongst the greens and cabbages.",
        "Then he looked around him, and said, ’I wish I had something to eat,\nif not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples\nnor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.’ At last he\nthought to himself, ’I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen\nme.’ So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he\nswallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with\nhorror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very\nhungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to\nanother kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt\nanother change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to\nhave found his old shape again.",
        "Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and\nwhen he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good\nand the bad salad, and thought to himself, ’This will help me to my\nfortune again, and enable me to pay off some folks for their\ntreachery.’ So he went away to try and find the castle of his friends;\nand after wandering about a few days he luckily found it. Then he\nstained his face all over brown, so that even his mother would not\nhave known him, and went into the castle and asked for a lodging; ’I\nam so tired,’ said he, ’that I can go no farther.’ ’Countryman,’ said\nthe witch, ’who are you? and what is your business?’ ’I am,’ said he,\n’a messenger sent by the king to find the finest salad that grows\nunder the sun. I have been lucky enough to find it, and have brought\nit with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to\nwither, and I don’t know that I can carry it farther.’",
        "When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they\nlonged to taste it, and said, ’Dear countryman, let us just taste it.’\n’To be sure,’ answered he; ’I have two heads of it with me, and will\ngive you one’; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the\nwitch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was\nready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves\nimmediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they\nswallowed when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the\ncourt in the form of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the\nkitchen, and seeing the salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on\nthe way she too felt a wish to taste it as the old woman had done, and\nate some leaves; so she also was turned into an ass and ran after the\nother, letting the dish with the salad fall on the ground. The\nmessenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and as\nnobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, ’I\ndon’t know where the salad can be.’ Then he thought something must\nhave happened, and said, ’I will go into the kitchen and see.’ And as\nhe went he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad\nlying on the ground. ’All right!’ said he; ’those two have had their\nshare.’ Then he took up the rest of the leaves, laid them on the dish\nand brought them to the young lady, saying, ’I bring you the dish\nmyself that you may not wait any longer.’ So she ate of it, and like\nthe others ran off into the court braying away.",
        "Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they\nmight know him. ’Now you shall be paid for your roguery,’ said he; and\ntied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he\ncame to a mill and knocked at the window. ’What’s the matter?’ said\nthe miller. ’I have three tiresome beasts here,’ said the other; ’if\nyou will take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell\nyou, I will pay you whatever you ask.’ ’With all my heart,’ said the\nmiller; ’but how shall I treat them?’ Then the huntsman said, ’Give\nthe old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who\nwas the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give\nthe youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no\nstripes’: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.\nAfter this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he\nwanted.",
        "Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass\nwas dead; ’The other two,’ said he, ’are alive and eat, but are so\nsorrowful that they cannot last long.’ Then the huntsman pitied them,\nand told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he\ngave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady\nfell upon her knees before him, and said, ’O dearest huntsman! forgive\nme all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was\nagainst my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak\nhangs up in the closet, and as for the bird’s heart, I will give it\nyou too.’ But he said, ’Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I\nmean to make you my wife.’ So they were married, and lived together\nvery happily till they died.",
        "A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and\nsensible, and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and\ncould neither learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him\nthey said: ’There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’\nWhen anything had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced\nto do it; but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late,\nor in the night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any\nother dismal place, he answered: ’Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it\nmakes me shudder!’ for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the\nfire at night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes\nsaid: ’Oh, it makes us shudder!’ The younger sat in a corner and\nlistened with the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could\nmean. ’They are always saying: “It makes me shudder, it makes me\nshudder!” It does not make me shudder,’ thought he. ’That, too, must\nbe an art of which I understand nothing!’",
        "Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: ’Hearken to\nme, you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong,\nand you too must learn something by which you can earn your bread.\nLook how your brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.’\n’Well, father,’ he replied, ’I am quite willing to learn something–\nindeed, if it could but be managed, I should like to learn how to\nshudder. I don’t understand that at all yet.’ The elder brother smiled\nwhen he heard that, and thought to himself: ’Goodness, what a\nblockhead that brother of mine is! He will never be good for anything\nas long as he lives! He who wants to be a sickle must bend himself\nbetimes.’",
        "The father sighed, and answered him: ’You shall soon learn what it is\nto shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.’",
        "Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the\nfather bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so\nbackward in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing.\n’Just think,’ said he, ’when I asked him how he was going to earn his\nbread, he actually wanted to learn to shudder.’ ’If that be all,’\nreplied the sexton, ’he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I\nwill soon polish him.’ The father was glad to do it, for he thought:\n’It will train the boy a little.’ The sexton therefore took him into\nhis house, and he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the\nsexton awoke him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the\nchurch tower and ring the bell. ’You shall soon learn what shuddering\nis,’ thought he, and secretly went there before him; and when the boy\nwas at the top of the tower and turned round, and was just going to\ntake hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the\nstairs opposite the sounding hole. ’Who is there?’ cried he, but the\nfigure made no reply, and did not move or stir. ’Give an answer,’\ncried the boy, ’or take yourself off, you have no business here at\nnight.’",
        "The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might\nthink he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: ’What do you want\nhere?–speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the\nsteps!’ The sexton thought: ’He can’t mean to be as bad as his words,’\nuttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy\ncalled to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,\nhe ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it\nfell down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner.\nThereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went\nto bed, and fell asleep. The sexton’s wife waited a long time for her\nhusband, but he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and\nwakened the boy, and asked: ’Do you know where my husband is? He\nclimbed up the tower before you did.’ ’No, I don’t know,’ replied the\nboy, ’but someone was standing by the sounding hole on the other side\nof the steps, and as he would neither gave an answer nor go away, I\ntook him for a scoundrel, and threw him downstairs. Just go there and\nyou will see if it was he. I should be sorry if it were.’ The woman\nran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in the corner,\nand had broken his leg.",
        "She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the\nboy’s father, ’Your boy,’ cried she, ’has been the cause of a great\nmisfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke\nhis leg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.’ The\nfather was terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. ’What\nwicked tricks are these?’ said he. ’The devil must have put them into\nyour head.’ ’Father,’ he replied, ’do listen to me. I am quite\ninnocent. He was standing there by night like one intent on doing\nevil. I did not know who it was, and I entreated him three times\neither to speak or to go away.’ ’Ah,’ said the father, ’I have nothing\nbut unhappiness with you. Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.’",
        "’Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I\ngo forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,\nunderstand one art which will support me.’ ’Learn what you will,’\nspoke the father, ’it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for\nyou. Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from\nwhence you come, and who is your father, for I have reason to be\nashamed of you.’ ’Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire\nnothing more than that, I can easily keep it in mind.’",
        "When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his\npocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to\nhimself: ’If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’ Then a man\napproached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding\nwith himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they\ncould see the gallows, the man said to him: ’Look, there is the tree\nwhere seven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now\nlearning how to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes,\nand you will soon learn how to shudder.’ ’If that is all that is\nwanted,’ answered the youth, ’it is easily done; but if I learn how to\nshudder as fast as that, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come\nback to me early in the morning.’ Then the youth went to the gallows,\nsat down beneath it, and waited till evening came. And as he was cold,\nhe lighted himself a fire, but at midnight the wind blew so sharply\nthat in spite of his fire, he could not get warm. And as the wind\nknocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved backwards\nand forwards, he thought to himself: ’If you shiver below by the fire,\nhow those up above must freeze and suffer!’ And as he felt pity for\nthem, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after\nthe other, and brought down all seven. Then he stoked the fire, blew\nit, and set them all round it to warm themselves. But they sat there\nand did not stir, and the fire caught their clothes. So he said: ’Take\ncare, or I will hang you up again.’ The dead men, however, did not\nhear, but were quite silent, and let their rags go on burning. At this\nhe grew angry, and said: ’If you will not take care, I cannot help\nyou, I will not be burnt with you,’ and he hung them up again each in\nhis turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep, and the next\nmorning the man came to him and wanted to have the fifty talers, and\nsaid: ’Well do you know how to shudder?’ ’No,’ answered he, ’how\nshould I know? Those fellows up there did not open their mouths, and\nwere so stupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their\nbodies get burnt.’ Then the man saw that he would not get the fifty\ntalers that day, and went away saying: ’Such a youth has never come my\nway before.’",
        "The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to\nhimself: ’Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!’ A\nwaggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ’Who are\nyou?’ ’I don’t know,’ answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked:\n’From whence do you come?’ ’I know not.’ ’Who is your father?’ ’That I\nmay not tell you.’ ’What is it that you are always muttering between\nyour teeth?’ ’Ah,’ replied the youth, ’I do so wish I could shudder,\nbut no one can teach me how.’ ’Enough of your foolish chatter,’ said\nthe waggoner. ’Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.’\nThe youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at\nan inn where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of\nthe parlour the youth again said quite loudly: ’If I could but\nshudder! If I could but shudder!’ The host who heard this, laughed and\nsaid: ’If that is your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity\nfor you here.’ ’Ah, be silent,’ said the hostess, ’so many prying\npersons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and a shame\nif such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again.’",
        "But the youth said: ’However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For\nthis purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’ He let the host have no\nrest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a\nhaunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering\nwas, if he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had\npromised that he who would venture should have his daughter to wife,\nand she was the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in\nthe castle lay great treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits,\nand these treasures would then be freed, and would make a poor man\nrich enough. Already many men had gone into the castle, but as yet\nnone had come out again. Then the youth went next morning to the king,\nand said: ’If it be allowed, I will willingly watch three nights in\nthe haunted castle.’",
        "The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: ’You\nmay ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they\nmust be things without life.’ Then he answered: ’Then I ask for a\nfire, a turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’",
        "The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the\nday. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself a\nbright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife\nbeside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. ’Ah, if I could\nbut shudder!’ said he, ’but I shall not learn it here either.’ Towards\nmidnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,\nsomething cried suddenly from one corner: ’Au, miau! how cold we are!’\n’You fools!’ cried he, ’what are you crying about? If you are cold,\ncome and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.’ And when he had\nsaid that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat\ndown on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery\neyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:\n’Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?’ ’Why not?’ he replied, ’but\njust show me your paws.’ Then they stretched out their claws. ’Oh,’\nsaid he, ’what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for\nyou.’ Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the\ncutting-board and screwed their feet fast. ’I have looked at your\nfingers,’ said he, ’and my fancy for card-playing has gone,’ and he\nstruck them dead and threw them out into the water. But when he had\nmade away with these two, and was about to sit down again by his fire,\nout from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with\nred-hot chains, and more and more of them came until he could no\nlonger move, and they yelled horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it\nto pieces, and tried to put it out. He watched them for a while\nquietly, but at last when they were going too far, he seized his\ncutting-knife, and cried: ’Away with you, vermin,’ and began to cut\nthem down. Some of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out\ninto the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned the embers of his fire\nagain and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his eyes would keep open\nno longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he looked round and saw\na great bed in the corner. ’That is the very thing for me,’ said he,\nand got into it. When he was just going to shut his eyes, however, the\nbed began to move of its own accord, and went over the whole of the\ncastle. ’That’s right,’ said he, ’but go faster.’ Then the bed rolled\non as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over thresholds\nand stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside down, and lay\non him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up in the air,\ngot out and said: ’Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and lay down by\nhis fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king came, and\nwhen he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil spirits\nhad killed him and he was dead. Then said he: ’After all it is a\npity,–for so handsome a man.’ The youth heard it, got up, and said:\n’It has not come to that yet.’ Then the king was astonished, but very\nglad, and asked how he had fared. ’Very well indeed,’ answered he;\n’one night is past, the two others will pass likewise.’ Then he went\nto the innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ’I never\nexpected to see you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?’\n’No,’ said he, ’it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!’",
        "The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the\nfire, and once more began his old song: ’If I could but shudder!’ When\nmidnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at\nfirst it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for\na while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the\nchimney and fell before him. ’Hullo!’ cried he, ’another half belongs\nto this. This is not enough!’ Then the uproar began again, there was a\nroaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. ’Wait,’\nsaid he, ’I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.’ When he had\ndone that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together,\nand a hideous man was sitting in his place. ’That is no part of our\nbargain,’ said the youth, ’the bench is mine.’ The man wanted to push\nhim away; the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off\nwith all his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then\nstill more men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead\nmen’s legs and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins\nwith them. The youth also wanted to play and said: ’Listen you, can I\njoin you?’ ’Yes, if you have any money.’ ’Money enough,’ replied he,\n’but your balls are not quite round.’ Then he took the skulls and put\nthem in the lathe and turned them till they were round. ’There, now\nthey will roll better!’ said he. ’Hurrah! now we’ll have fun!’ He\nplayed with them and lost some of his money, but when it struck\ntwelve, everything vanished from his sight. He lay down and quietly\nfell asleep. Next morning the king came to inquire after him. ’How has\nit fared with you this time?’ asked he. ’I have been playing at nine-\npins,’ he answered, ’and have lost a couple of farthings.’ ’Have you\nnot shuddered then?’ ’What?’ said he, ’I have had a wonderful time! If\nI did but know what it was to shudder!’",
        "The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:\n’If I could but shudder.’ When it grew late, six tall men came in and\nbrought a coffin. Then he said: ’Ha, ha, that is certainly my little\ncousin, who died only a few days ago,’ and he beckoned with his\nfinger, and cried: ’Come, little cousin, come.’ They placed the coffin\non the ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man\nlay therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. ’Wait,’ said\nhe, ’I will warm you a little,’ and went to the fire and warmed his\nhand and laid it on the dead man’s face, but he remained cold. Then he\ntook him out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and\nrubbed his arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did\nno good, he thought to himself: ’When two people lie in bed together,\nthey warm each other,’ and carried him to the bed, covered him over\nand lay down by him. After a short time the dead man became warm too,\nand began to move. Then said the youth, ’See, little cousin, have I\nnot warmed you?’ The dead man, however, got up and cried: ’Now will I\nstrangle you.’",
        "’What!’ said he, ’is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go\ninto your coffin again,’ and he took him up, threw him into it, and\nshut the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. ’I\ncannot manage to shudder,’ said he. ’I shall never learn it here as\nlong as I live.’",
        "Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked\nterrible. He was old, however, and had a long white beard. ’You\nwretch,’ cried he, ’you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for\nyou shall die.’ ’Not so fast,’ replied the youth. ’If I am to die, I\nshall have to have a say in it.’ ’I will soon seize you,’ said the\nfiend. ’Softly, softly, do not talk so big. I am as strong as you are,\nand perhaps even stronger.’ ’We shall see,’ said the old man. ’If you\nare stronger, I will let you go–come, we will try.’ Then he led him\nby dark passages to a smith’s forge, took an axe, and with one blow\nstruck an anvil into the ground. ’I can do better than that,’ said the\nyouth, and went to the other anvil. The old man placed himself near\nand wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down. Then the youth\nseized the axe, split the anvil with one blow, and in it caught the\nold man’s beard. ’Now I have you,’ said the youth. ’Now it is your\nturn to die.’ Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he\nmoaned and entreated him to stop, when he would give him great riches.\nThe youth drew out the axe and let him go. The old man led him back\ninto the castle, and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold.\n’Of these,’ said he, ’one part is for the poor, the other for the\nking, the third yours.’ In the meantime it struck twelve, and the\nspirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in darkness. ’I shall\nstill be able to find my way out,’ said he, and felt about, found the\nway into the room, and slept there by his fire. Next morning the king\ncame and said: ’Now you must have learnt what shuddering is?’ ’No,’ he\nanswered; ’what can it be? My dead cousin was here, and a bearded man\ncame and showed me a great deal of money down below, but no one told\nme what it was to shudder.’ ’Then,’ said the king, ’you have saved the\ncastle, and shall marry my daughter.’ ’That is all very well,’ said\nhe, ’but still I do not know what it is to shudder!’",
        "Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever\nmuch the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still\nsaid always: ’If I could but shudder–if I could but shudder.’ And\nthis at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: ’I will find a cure\nfor him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.’ She went out to\nthe stream which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful\nof gudgeons brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping,\nhis wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of\ncold water with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes\nwould sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: ’Oh, what makes me\nshudder so?– what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what\nit is to shudder!’",
        "A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was\nvery beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of\nthe princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her,\nand she only made sport of them.",
        "Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all\nher suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their rank\n–kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,\nand knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she\nhad something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat:\n’He’s as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ’What a\nmaypole!’ said she. The next was too short: ’What a dumpling!’ said\nshe. The fourth was too pale, and she called him ’Wallface.’ The fifth\nwas too red, so she called him ’Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight\nenough; so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to\ndry over a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon\nevery one: but she laughed more than all at a good king who was there.\n’Look at him,’ said she; ’his beard is like an old mop; he shall be\ncalled Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.",
        "But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,\nand how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or\nunwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar,\nthat came to the door.",
        "Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play\nunder the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,\n’Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when\nhe had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then\nthe king said, ’You have sung so well, that I will give you my\ndaughter for your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king\nsaid, ’I have sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my\nword.’ So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for,\nand she was married to the fiddler. When this was over the king said,\n’Now get ready to go–you must not stay here–you must travel on with\nyour husband.’",
        "Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon\ncame to a great wood. ’Pray,’ said she, ’whose is this wood?’ ’It\nbelongs to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ’hadst thou taken him, all\nhad been thine.’ ’Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ’would\nthat I had married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine\nmeadows. ’Whose are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ’They\nbelong to King Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been\nthine.’ ’Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ’would that I had\nmarried King Grisly-beard!’",
        "Then they came to a great city. ’Whose is this noble city?’ said she.\n’It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all\nbeen thine.’ ’Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ’why did I not marry\nKing Grisly-beard?’ ’That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler:\n’why should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for\nyou?’",
        "At last they came to a small cottage. ’What a paltry place!’ said she;\n’to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,\n’That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ’Where are your\nservants?’ cried she. ’What do we want with servants?’ said he; ’you\nmust do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and\nput on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the\nprincess knew nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was\nforced to help her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went\nto bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to\nclean the house. Thus they lived for two days: and when they had eaten\nup all there was in the cottage, the man said, ’Wife, we can’t go on\nthus, spending money and earning nothing. You must learn to weave\nbaskets.’ Then he went out and cut willows, and brought them home, and\nshe began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore. ’I see this\nwork won’t do,’ said he: ’try and spin; perhaps you will do that\nbetter.’ So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her\ntender fingers till the blood ran. ’See now,’ said the fiddler, ’you\nare good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain I have got!\nHowever, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall\nstand in the market and sell them.’ ’Alas!’ sighed she, ’if any of my\nfather’s court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how\nthey will laugh at me!’",
        "But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she\ndid not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many\npeople, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid\ntheir money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on\nthis as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of\nware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market;\nbut a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her\nstall, and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began\nto cry, and knew not what to do. ’Ah! what will become of me?’ said\nshe; ’what will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all.\n’Who would have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ’as to\nput an earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody\npasses? but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this\nsort of work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they\ndid not want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and\nthere you will have plenty to eat.’",
        "Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all\nthe dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat\nthat was left, and on this they lived.",
        "She had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest\nson was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the\nwindows and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and\nbrightness of the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the\npride and folly which had brought her so low. And the servants gave\nher some of the rich meats, which she put into her basket to take\nhome.",
        "All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in\ngolden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took\nher by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but\nshe trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who\nwas making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in;\nand the cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell\nabout. Then everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so\nabashed, that she wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth.\nShe sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard\novertook her, and brought her back and said, ’Fear me not! I am the\nfiddler who has lived with you in the hut. I brought you there because\nI really loved you. I am also the soldier that overset your stall. I\nhave done all this only to cure you of your silly pride, and to show\nyou the folly of your ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have\nlearnt wisdom, and it is time to hold our marriage feast.’",
        "Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes;\nand her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed\nher home on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The\nfeast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish\nthat you and I had been of the party.",
        "There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his\npalace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a\nhuntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. ’Perhaps some\naccident has befallen him,’ said the king, and the next day he sent\nout two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed\naway. Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said:\n’Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have\nfound all three.’ But of these also, none came home again, none were\nseen again. From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into\nthe forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and\nnothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over\nit. This lasted for many years, when an unknown huntsman announced\nhimself to the king as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the\ndangerous forest. The king, however, would not give his consent, and\nsaid: ’It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with you no\nbetter than with the others, and you would never come out again.’ The\nhuntsman replied: ’Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I\nknow nothing.’",
        "The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It\nwas not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and\nwanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it\nstood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm\nstretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under. When\nthe huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come with\nbuckets and bale out the water. When they could see to the bottom\nthere lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose\nhair hung over his face down to his knees. They bound him with cords,\nand led him away to the castle. There was great astonishment over the\nwild man; the king, however, had him put in an iron cage in his\ncourtyard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the\nqueen herself was to take the key into her keeping. And from this time\nforth everyone could again go into the forest with safety.",
        "The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the\ncourtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the\ncage. The boy ran thither and said: ’Give me my ball out.’ ’Not till\nyou have opened the door for me,’ answered the man. ’No,’ said the\nboy, ’I will not do that; the king has forbidden it,’ and ran away.\nThe next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said:\n’Open my door,’ but the boy would not. On the third day the king had\nridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said: ’I cannot\nopen the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.’ Then the wild\nman said: ’It lies under your mother’s pillow, you can get it there.’\nThe boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the\nwinds, and brought the key. The door opened with difficulty, and the\nboy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man stepped out,\ngave him the golden ball, and hurried away. The boy had become afraid;\nhe called and cried after him: ’Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I\nshall be beaten!’ The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on\nhis shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest. When the king\ncame home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen how that\nhad happened. She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it\nwas gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The king sent out\npeople to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. Then\nhe could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the\nroyal court.",
        "When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the\nboy down from his shoulder, and said to him: ’You will never see your\nfather and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set\nme free, and I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you\nshall fare well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than\nanyone in the world.’ He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he\nslept, and the next morning the man took him to a well, and said:\n’Behold, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall\nsit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be\npolluted. I will come every evening to see if you have obeyed my\norder.’ The boy placed himself by the brink of the well, and often saw\na golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care\nthat nothing fell in. As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so\nviolently that he involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it\nquickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever\npains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose. In\nthe evening Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said: ’What\nhas happened to the well?’ ’Nothing nothing,’ he answered, and held\nhis finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. But he\nsaid: ’You have dipped your finger into the water, this time it may\npass, but take care you do not again let anything go in.’ By daybreak\nthe boy was already sitting by the well and watching it. His finger\nhurt him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a\nhair fell down into the well. He took it quickly out, but it was\nalready quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew what had\nhappened. ’You have let a hair fall into the well,’ said he. ’I will\nallow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third\ntime then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with me.’",
        "On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his\nfinger, however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he\nlooked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And\nas he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying\nto look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his\nshoulders into the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole\nof the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You\ncan imagine how terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-\nhandkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man might\nnot see it. When he came he already knew everything, and said: ’Take\nthe handkerchief off.’ Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let\nthe boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use. ’You have not\nstood the trial and can stay here no longer. Go forth into the world,\nthere you will learn what poverty is. But as you have not a bad heart,\nand as I mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant you; if you\nfall into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry: “Iron Hans,” and\nthen I will come and help you. My power is great, greater than you\nthink, and I have gold and silver in abundance.’",
        "Then the king’s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten\npaths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he\nlooked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which\nhe could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if\nthey would take him in. The people about court did not at all know\nwhat use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to\nstay. At length the cook took him into his service, and said he might\ncarry wood and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so\nhappened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry\nthe food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden\nhair be seen, he kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had\nnever yet come under the king’s notice, and he said: ’When you come to\nthe royal table you must take your hat off.’ He answered: ’Ah, Lord, I\ncannot; I have a bad sore place on my head.’ Then the king had the\ncook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take\nsuch a boy as that into his service; and that he was to send him away\nat once. The cook, however, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the\ngardener’s boy.",
        "And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and\nbear the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working\nalone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off\nthat the air might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered\nand flashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king’s\ndaughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw\nthe boy, and cried to him: ’Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.’ He put\nhis cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound\nthem together. When he was ascending the stairs with them, the\ngardener met him, and said: ’How can you take the king’s daughter a\ngarland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get another, and seek\nout the prettiest and rarest.’ ’Oh, no,’ replied the boy, ’the wild\nones have more scent, and will please her better.’ When he got into\nthe room, the king’s daughter said: ’Take your cap off, it is not\nseemly to keep it on in my presence.’ He again said: ’I may not, I\nhave a sore head.’ She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off,\nand then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was\nsplendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm,\nand gave him a handful of ducats. With these he departed, but he cared\nnothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the gardener, and said:\n’I present them to your children, they can play with them.’ The\nfollowing day the king’s daughter again called to him that he was to\nbring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it, she\ninstantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him,\nbut he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of\nducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for\nplaythings for his children. On the third day things went just the\nsame; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have\nher money.",
        "Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered\ntogether his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer\nany opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a\nmighty army. Then said the gardener’s boy: ’I am grown up, and will go\nto the wars also, only give me a horse.’ The others laughed, and said:\n’Seek one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us\nin the stable for you.’ When they had gone forth, he went into the\nstable, and led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped\nhobblety jib, hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away\nto the dark forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called ’Iron\nHans’ three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees.\nThereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said: ’What do you\ndesire?’ ’I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.’ ’That\nyou shall have, and still more than you ask for.’ Then the wild man\nwent back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy\ncame out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and\ncould hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of\nwarriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the\nsun. The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy,\nmounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers. When he got\nnear the battlefield a great part of the king’s men had already\nfallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then the\nyouth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane\nover the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They began to flee,\nbut the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single\nman left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he conducted his\ntroop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron Hans. ’What\ndo you desire?’ asked the wild man. ’Take back your horse and your\ntroops, and give me my three-legged horse again.’ All that he asked\nwas done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When the\nking returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished\nhim joy of his victory. ’I am not the one who carried away the\nvictory,’ said he, ’but a strange knight who came to my assistance\nwith his soldiers.’ The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight\nwas, but the king did not know, and said: ’He followed the enemy, and\nI did not see him again.’ She inquired of the gardener where his boy\nwas, but he smiled, and said: ’He has just come home on his three-\nlegged horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying: “Here\ncomes our hobblety jib back again!” They asked, too: “Under what hedge\nhave you been lying sleeping all the time?” So he said: “I did the\nbest of all, and it would have gone badly without me.” And then he was\nstill more ridiculed.’",
        "The king said to his daughter: ’I will proclaim a great feast that\nshall last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps\nthe unknown man will show himself.’ When the feast was announced, the\nyouth went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. ’What do you\ndesire?’ asked he. ’That I may catch the king’s daughter’s golden\napple.’ ’It is as safe as if you had it already,’ said Iron Hans. ’You\nshall likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on\na spirited chestnut-horse.’ When the day came, the youth galloped to\nthe spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no\none. The king’s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the\nknights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it\nhe galloped away.",
        "On the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave\nhim a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and\nhe did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew\nangry, and said: ’That is not allowed; he must appear before me and\ntell his name.’ He gave the order that if the knight who caught the\napple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would\nnot come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.",
        "On the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour\nand a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was\nriding off with it, the king’s attendants pursued him, and one of them\ngot so near him that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his\nsword. The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt\nso violently that the helmet fell from the youth’s head, and they\ncould see that he had golden hair. They rode back and announced this\nto the king.",
        "The following day the king’s daughter asked the gardener about his\nboy. ’He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the\nfestival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise\nshown my children three golden apples which he has won.’",
        "The king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had\nhis little cap on his head. But the king’s daughter went up to him and\ntook it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders,\nand he was so handsome that all were amazed. ’Are you the knight who\ncame every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who\ncaught the three golden apples?’ asked the king. ’Yes,’ answered he,\n’and here the apples are,’ and he took them out of his pocket, and\nreturned them to the king. ’If you desire further proof, you may see\nthe wound which your people gave me when they followed me. But I am\nlikewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.’\n’If you can perform such deeds as that, you are no gardener’s boy;\ntell me, who is your father?’ ’My father is a mighty king, and gold\nhave I in plenty as great as I require.’ ’I well see,’ said the king,\n’that I owe my thanks to you; can I do anything to please you?’ ’Yes,’\nanswered he, ’that indeed you can. Give me your daughter to wife.’ The\nmaiden laughed, and said: ’He does not stand much on ceremony, but I\nhave already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener’s boy,’\nand then she went and kissed him. His father and mother came to the\nwedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of\never seeing their dear son again. And as they were sitting at the\nmarriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a\nstately king came in with a great retinue. He went up to the youth,\nembraced him and said: ’I am Iron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild\nman, but you have set me free; all the treasures which I possess,\nshall be your property.’",
        "There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and\nwas so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole\nface of the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she\nfelt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said,\n’Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a\nwife who is as beautiful as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.’\nThen when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her\neyes and died. But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long\ntime never thought of taking another wife. At last, however, his wise\nmen said, ’this will not do; the king must marry again, that we may\nhave a queen.’ So messengers were sent far and wide, to seek for a\nbride as beautiful as the late queen. But there was no princess in the\nworld so beautiful; and if there had been, still there was not one to\nbe found who had golden hair. So the messengers came home, and had had\nall their trouble for nothing.",
        "Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,\nand had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king\nlooked at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he\nsaid to his courtiers, ’May I not marry my daughter? She is the very\nimage of my dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride\nupon the whole earth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the\ncourtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, ’Heaven forbid that\na father should marry his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can\ncome.’ And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would\nsoon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, ’Before I marry anyone\nI must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another\nmust be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling\nas the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different\nkinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must\ngive a part of his skin.’ And thus she though he would think of the\nmatter no more. But the king made the most skilful workmen in his\nkingdom weave the three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another\nsilvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his\nhunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to\ntake the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a\nthousand furs was made.",
        "When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the\nnight when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden\nring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three\ndresses–of the sun, the moon, and the stars–up in a nutshell, and\nwrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and\nbesmeared her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon\nHeaven for help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole\nnight, till at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired,\nshe sat herself down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and\nthere she slept on till it was midday.",
        "Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs\ncame to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round,\nand bark. ’Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ’and see what\nsort of game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and\nwhen they came back again said, ’In the hollow tree there lies a most\nwonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of\na thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ’See,’ said\nthe king, ’if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So\nthe huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly\nfrightened, and said, ’I am a poor child that has neither father nor\nmother left; have pity on me and take me with you.’ Then they said,\n’Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the\nashes, and do things of that sort.’ So they put her into the coach,\nand took her home to the king’s palace. Then they showed her a little\ncorner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped in, and\nsaid, ’Cat-skin, you may lie and sleep there.’ And she was sent into\nthe kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow the fire, pluck\nthe poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty\nwork.",
        "Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ’Ah! pretty\nprincess!’ thought she, ’what will now become of thee?’ But it\nhappened one day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so\nshe said to the cook, ’May I go up a little while and see what is\ngoing on? I will take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook\nsaid, ’Yes, you may go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to\nrake out the ashes.’ Then she took her little lamp, and went into her\ncabin, and took off the fur skin, and washed the soot from off her\nface and hands, so that her beauty shone forth like the sun from\nbehind the clouds. She next opened her nutshell, and brought out of it\nthe dress that shone like the sun, and so went to the feast. Everyone\nmade way for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she could be\nno less than a king’s daughter. But the king came up to her, and held\nout his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, ’I\nnever saw any one half so beautiful.’",
        "When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked\nround for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood\nat the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth\nwas, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,\nblackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was Cat-\nskin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to\nrake the ashes, the cook said, ’Let that alone till the morning, and\nheat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but\ntake care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance\nof never eating again.’",
        "As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king’s soup, and\ntoasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when\nit was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden\nring, and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance\nwas over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased\nhim so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before.\nAt the bottom he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out\nhow it had got there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was\nfrightened when he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ’You must\nhave let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good\nbeating.’ Then he went before the king, and he asked him who had\ncooked the soup. ’I did,’ answered the cook. But the king said, ’That\nis not true; it was better done than you could do it.’ Then he\nanswered, ’To tell the truth I did not cook it, but Cat-skin did.’\n’Then let Cat-skin come up,’ said the king: and when she came he said\nto her, ’Who are you?’ ’I am a poor child,’ said she, ’that has lost\nboth father and mother.’ ’How came you in my palace?’ asked he. ’I am\ngood for nothing,’ said she, ’but to be scullion-girl, and to have\nboots and shoes thrown at my head.’ ’But how did you get the ring that\nwas in the soup?’ asked the king. Then she would not own that she knew\nanything about the ring; so the king sent her away again about her\nbusiness.",
        "After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to\nlet her go up and see it as before. ’Yes,’ said he, ’but come again in\nhalf an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.’ Then\nshe ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her\ndress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she\nwent in, looking like a king’s daughter, the king went up to her, and\nrejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with\nher. After the dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly\nthat the king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her\nlittle cabin, and made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the\nkitchen to cook the soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got\nthe golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought\nto the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as well as before; so he\nsent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had\ncooked it. Cat-skin was brought again before the king, but she still\ntold him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her\nhead.",
        "But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third\ntime, it happened just the same as before. ’You must be a witch, Cat-\nskin,’ said the cook; ’for you always put something into your soup, so\nthat it pleases the king better than mine.’ However, he let her go up\nas before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars,\nand went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again,\nand thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So\nwhilst he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger\nwithout her seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a\nlong time. When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the\nhand, but she slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd\nthat he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her\nlittle cabin under the stairs. But this time she kept away too long,\nand stayed beyond the half-hour; so she had not time to take off her\nfine dress, and threw her fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not\nblacken herself all over with soot, but left one of her fingers white.",
        "Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’s soup; and as soon\nas the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When\nthe king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once\nmore, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on\nit whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold\nof it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur\ncloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled\nunderneath it.",
        "Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and\nbeautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she\nwashed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the\nmost beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,\n’You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each\nother.’ And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as\never was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.",
        "There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of\nthe cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which\nbore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like\nthe two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-\nred. They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two\nchildren in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle\nthan Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and\nfields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at\nhome with her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to\nher when there was nothing to do.",
        "The two children were so fond of one another that they always held\neach other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-\nwhite said: ’We will not leave each other,’ Rose-red answered: ’Never\nso long as we live,’ and their mother would add: ’What one has she\nmust share with the other.’",
        "They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no\nbeasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The\nlittle hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe\ngrazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds\nsat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew.",
        "No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest,\nand night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the\nmoss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did\nnot worry on their account.",
        "Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused\nthem, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near\ntheir bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing\nand went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that\nthey had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly\nhave fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces\nfurther. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel\nwho watches over good children.",
        "Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat\nthat it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took\ncare of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her\nmother’s bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In\nthe winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The\nkettle was of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished.\nIn the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: ’Go, Snow-\nwhite, and bolt the door,’ and then they sat round the hearth, and the\nmother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the\ntwo girls listened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb\nupon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its\nhead hidden beneath its wings.",
        "One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone\nknocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said:\n’Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking\nshelter.’ Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was\na poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad,\nblack head within the door.",
        "Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove\nfluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed. But the\nbear began to speak and said: ’Do not be afraid, I will do you no\nharm! I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside\nyou.’",
        "’Poor bear,’ said the mother, ’lie down by the fire, only take care\nthat you do not burn your coat.’ Then she cried: ’Snow-white, Rose-\nred, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.’ So they\nboth came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were\nnot afraid of him. The bear said: ’Here, children, knock the snow out\nof my coat a little’; so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s\nhide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled\ncontentedly and comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at\nhome, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair\nwith their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about,\nor they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they\nlaughed. But the bear took it all in good part, only when they were\ntoo rough he called out: ’Leave me alive, children,",
        " ’Snow-white, Rose-red,\n  Will you beat your wooer dead?’",
        "When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to\nthe bear: ’You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe\nfrom the cold and the bad weather.’ As soon as day dawned the two\nchildren let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.",
        "Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself\ndown by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as\nmuch as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were\nnever fastened until their black friend had arrived.",
        "When spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one\nmorning to Snow-white: ’Now I must go away, and cannot come back for\nthe whole summer.’ ’Where are you going, then, dear bear?’ asked Snow-\nwhite. ’I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the\nwicked dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are\nobliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when\nthe sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and\ncome out to pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in\ntheir caves, does not easily see daylight again.’",
        "Snow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the\ndoor for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the\nbolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to\nSnow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not\nsure about it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight\nbehind the trees.",
        "A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest\nto get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the\nground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and\nforwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When\nthey came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a\nsnow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a\ncrevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a\ndog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do.",
        "He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: ’Why do you\nstand there? Can you not come here and help me?’ ’What are you up to,\nlittle man?’ asked Rose-red. ’You stupid, prying goose!’ answered the\ndwarf: ’I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for\ncooking. The little bit of food that we people get is immediately\nburnt up with heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse,\ngreedy folk. I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was\ngoing as I wished; but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly\nsprang out, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out\nmy beautiful white beard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away,\nand the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you\nare!’",
        "The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out,\nit was caught too fast. ’I will run and fetch someone,’ said Rose-red.\n’You senseless goose!’ snarled the dwarf; ’why should you fetch\nsomeone? You are already two too many for me; can you not think of\nsomething better?’ ’Don’t be impatient,’ said Snow-white, ’I will help\nyou,’ and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the\nend of the beard.",
        "As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay\namongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted\nit up, grumbling to himself: ’Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my\nfine beard. Bad luck to you!’ and then he swung the bag upon his back,\nand went off without even once looking at the children.",
        "Some time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of\nfish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large\ngrasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.\nThey ran to it and found it was the dwarf. ’Where are you going?’ said\nRose-red; ’you surely don’t want to go into the water?’ ’I am not such\na fool!’ cried the dwarf; ’don’t you see that the accursed fish wants\nto pull me in?’ The little man had been sitting there fishing, and\nunluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a\nmoment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not\nstrength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the\ndwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was\nof little good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish,\nand was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.",
        "The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his\nbeard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled\nfast together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors\nand cut the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf\nsaw that he screamed out: ’Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure\na man’s face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now\nyou have cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by\nmy people. I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!’\nThen he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without\nanother word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.",
        "It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to\nthe town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road\nled them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn\nabout. There they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying\nslowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at\nlast settled near a rock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud,\npiteous cry. They ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized\ntheir old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going to carry him off.",
        "The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man,\nand pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.\nAs soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with\nhis shrill voice: ’Could you not have done it more carefully! You\ndragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you\nclumsy creatures!’ Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and\nslipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by\nthis time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did\ntheir business in town.",
        "As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the\ndwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,\nand had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening\nsun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with\nall colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared at\nthem. ’Why do you stand gaping there?’ cried the dwarf, and his ashen-\ngrey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a\nloud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them\nout of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not\nreach his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of\nhis heart he cried: ’Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my\ntreasures; look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life;\nwhat do you want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not\nfeel me between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they\nare tender morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy’s sake eat\nthem!’ The bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked\ncreature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again.",
        "The girls had run away, but the bear called to them: ’Snow-white and\nRose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.’ Then they\nrecognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly\nhis bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all\nin gold. ’I am a king’s son,’ he said, ’and I was bewitched by that\nwicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the\nforest as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got\nhis well-deserved punishment.",
        "Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they\ndivided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered\ntogether in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with\nher children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and\nthey stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful\nroses, white and red.",
        "The Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were\nborn in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse.\nThroughout their lives they remained close friends, and both studied\nlaw at Marburg University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German\nphilology, and although Wilhelm’s work was hampered by poor health the\nbrothers collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not\ncompleted until a century after their deaths. But they were best (and\nuniversally) known for the collection of over two hundred folk tales\nthey made from oral sources and published in two volumes of ’Nursery\nand Household Tales’ in 1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to\npreserve such material as part of German cultural and literary\nhistory, and their collection was first published with scholarly notes\nand no illustration, the tales soon came into the possession of young\nreaders. This was in part due to Edgar Taylor, who made the first\nEnglish translation in 1823, selecting about fifty stories ’with the\namusement of some young friends principally in view.’ They have been\nan essential ingredient of children’s reading ever since.",
