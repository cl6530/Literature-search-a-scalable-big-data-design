        "It is a happy memory that associates the foundation of our Royal\nAcademy with the delivery of these inaugural discourses by Sir\nJoshua Reynolds, on the opening of the schools, and at the first\nannual meetings for the distribution of its prizes.  They laid down\nprinciples of art from the point of view of a man of genius who had\nmade his power felt, and with the clear good sense which is the\nfoundation of all work that looks upward and may hope to live.  The\ntruths here expressed concerning Art may, with slight adjustment of\nthe way of thought, be applied to Literature or to any exercise of\nthe best powers of mind for shaping the delights that raise us to\nthe larger sense of life.  In his separation of the utterance of\nwhole truths from insistance upon accidents of detail, Reynolds was\nright, because he guarded the expression of his view with careful\ndefinitions of its limits.  In the same way Boileau was right, as a\ncritic of Literature, in demanding everywhere good sense, in\ncondemning the paste brilliants of a style then in decay, and\nfixing attention upon the masterly simplicity of Roman poets in the\ntime of Augustus.  Critics by rule of thumb reduced the principles\nclearly defined by Boileau to a dull convention, against which\nthere came in course of time a strong reaction.  In like manner the\nteaching of Reynolds was applied by dull men to much vague and\nconventional generalisation in the name of dignity.  Nevertheless,\nReynolds taught essential truths of Art.  The principles laid down\nby him will never fail to give strength to the right artist, or\ntrue guidance towards the appreciation of good art, though here and\nthere we may not wholly assent to some passing application of them,\nwhere the difference may be great between a fashion of thought in\nhis time and in ours.  A righteous enforcement of exact truth in\nour day has led many into a readiness to appreciate more really the\nminute imitation of a satin dress, or a red herring, than the\nnoblest figure in the best of Raffaelle’s cartoons.  Much good\nshould come of the diffusion of this wise little book.",
        "Joshua Reynolds was born on the 15th of July, 1723, the son of a\nclergyman and schoolmaster, at Plympton in Devonshire.  His bent\nfor Art was clear and strong from his childhood.  In 1741 at the\nage of nineteen, he began study, and studied for two yours in\nLondon under Thomas Hudson, a successful portrait painter.  Then he\nwent back to Devonshire and painted portraits, aided for some time\nin his education by attention to the work of William Gandy of\nExeter.  When twenty-six years old, in May, 1749, Reynolds was\ntaken away by Captain Keppel to the Mediterranean, and brought into\ncontact with the works of the great painters of Italy.  He stayed\ntwo years in Rome, and in accordance with the principles afterwards\nlaid down in these lectures, he refused, when in Rome, commissions\nfor copying, and gave his mind to minute observation of the art of\nthe great masters by whose works he was surrounded.  He spent two\nmonths in Florence, six weeks in Venice, a few days in Bologna and\nParma.  “If,” he said, “I had never seen any of the fine works of\nCorreggio, I should never, perhaps, have remarked in Nature the\nexpression which I find in one of his pieces; or if I had remarked\nit, I might have thought it too difficult, or perhaps impossible to\nexecute.”",
        "In 1753 Reynolds came back to England, and stayed three months in\nDevonshire before setting up a studio in London, in St. Martin’s\nLane, which was then an artists’ quarter.  His success was rapid.\nIn 1755 he had one hundred and twenty-five sitters.  Samuel Johnson\nfound in him his most congenial friend.  He moved to Newport\nStreet, and he built himself a studio–where there is now an\nauction room–at 47, Lincoln’s Inn Fields.  There he remained for\nlife.",
        "In 1760 the artists opened, in a room lent by the Society of Arts,\na free Exhibition for the sale of their works.  This was continued\nthe next year at Spring Gardens, with a charge of a shilling for\nadmission.  In 1765 they obtained a charter of incorporation, and\nin 1768 the King gave his support to the foundation of a Royal\nAcademy of Arts by seceders from the preceding “Incorporated\nSociety of Artists,” into which personal feelings had brought much\ndivision.  It was to consist, like the French Academy, of forty\nmembers, and was to maintain Schools open to all students of good\ncharacter who could give evidence that they had fully learnt the\nrudiments of Art.  The foundation by the King dates from the 10th\nof December, 1768.  The Schools were opened on the 2nd of January\nnext following, and on that occasion Joshua Reynolds, who had been\nelected President–his age was then between forty-five and forty-\nsix–gave the Inaugural Address which formed the first of these\nSeven Discourses.  The other six were given by him, as President,\nat the next six annual meetings:  and they were all shaped to form,\nwhen collected into a volume, a coherent body of good counsel upon\nthe foundations of the painter’s art.",
