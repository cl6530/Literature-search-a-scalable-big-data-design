        "In that same time when ended / was Lady Helke’s life,\nAnd that the monarch Etzel / did seek another wife,\nTo take a highborn widow / of the land of Burgundy\nHun his friends did counsel: / Lady Kriemhild hight was she.",
        "1144",
        "Since that was ended / the fair Helke’s life,\nSpake they: “Wilt thou ever / win for thee noble wife,\nThe highest and the fairest / that ever king did win,\nTake to thee this same lady / that doughty Siegfried’s spouse hath been.”",
        "1145",
        "Then spake the mighty monarch: / “How might that come to pass\nSince that I am a heathen, / nor named with sign of cross?\nThe lady is a Christian, / thereto she’ll ne’er agree.\nWrought must be a wonder, / if the thing may ever be.”",
        "1146",
        "Then spake again his warriors: / “She yet may do the same.\nFor sake of thy great power / and thy full lofty name\nShalt thou yet endeavor / such noble wife to gain.\nTo woo the stately lady / might each monarch high be fain.”",
        "1147",
        "Then spake the noble monarch: / “Who is ’mong men of mine,\nThat knoweth land and people / dwelling far by Rhine?\"\nSpake then of Bechelaren / the trusty Ruediger:\n“I have known from childhood / the noble queen that dwelleth there.",
        "1148",
        "“And Gunther and Gernot, / the noble knights and good,\nAnd hight the third is Giselher: / whatever any should\nThat standeth high in honor / and virtue, doth each one:\nEke from eld their fathers / have in like noble manner done.”",
        "1149",
        "Then spake again Etzel: / “Friend, now shalt thou tell,\nIf she within my country / crown might wear full well–\nFor be she fair of body / as hath been told to me,\nMy friends for this their counsel / shall ever full requited be.”",
        "1150",
        "“She likeneth in beauty / well my high lady,\nHelke that was so stately. / Nor forsooth might be\nIn all this world a fairer / spouse of king soe’er.\nWhom taketh she for wooer, / glad of heart and mind he were.”",
        "1151",
        "He spake: “Make trial, Ruediger, / as thou hold’st me dear.\nAnd if by Lady Kriemhild / e’er I lie full near,\nTherefor will I requite thee / as in best mode I may:\nSo hast thou then fulfilled / all my wish in fullest way.",
        "1152",
        "“Stores from out my treasure / I’ll bid to thee to give,\nThat thou with thy companions / merry long shalt live,\nOf steeds and rich apparel / what thou wilt have to share.\nThereof unto thy journey / I’ll bid in measure full prepare.”",
        "1153",
        "Thereto did give him answer / the margrave Ruediger:\n“Did I thy treasure covet / unworthy thing it were.\nGladly will I thy messenger / be unto the Rhine,\nFrom my own store provided: / all have I e’en from hand of thine.”",
        "1154",
        "Then spake the mighty monarch: / “When now wilt thou fare\nTo seek the lovely lady? / God of thee have care\nTo keep thee on thy journey / and eke a wife to me.\nTherein good fortune help me, / that she to us shall gracious be.”",
        "1155",
        "Then again spake Ruediger: / “Ere that this land we quit,\nMust we first prepare us / arms and apparel fit,\nThat we may thus in honor / in royal presence stand.\nTo the Rhine I’ll lead five hundred / warriors, a doughty band.",
        "1156",
        "“Wherever they in Burgundy / me and my men may see,\nShall they all and single / then confess of thee\nThat ne’er from any monarch / so many warriors went\nAs now to bear thy message / thou far unto the Rhine hast sent.",
        "1157",
        "“May it not, O mighty monarch, / thee from thy purpose move:\nErstwhile unto Siegfried / she gave her noble love,\nWho scion is of Siegmund: / him thou here hast seen.\nWorthy highest honor / verily the knight had been.”",
        "1158",
        "Then answered him King Etzel: / “Was she the warrior’s wife,\nSo worthy was of honor / the noble prince in life,\nThat I the royal lady / therefor no whit despise.\n’Tis her surpassing beauty / that shall be joy unto mine eyes.”",
        "1159",
        "Then further spake the margrave: / “Hear then what I do say:\nAfter days four-and-twenty / shall we from hence away.\nTidings to Gotelinde / I’ll send, my spouse full dear,\nThat I to Lady Kriemhild / myself will be thy messenger.”",
        "1160",
        "Away to Bechelaren / sent then Ruediger.\nBoth sad his spouse and joyous / was the news to hear.\nHe told how for the monarch / a wife he was to woo:\nWith love she well remembered / the fair Lady Helke too.",
        "1161",
        "When that the margravine / did the message hear,\nIn part ’twas sorrow to her, / and weep she must in fear\nAt having other mistress / than hers had been before.\nTo think on Lady Helke / did grieve her inmost heart full sore.",
        "1162",
        "Ruediger from Hunland / in seven days did part,\nWhereat the monarch Etzel / merry was of heart.\nWhen at Vienna city / all was ready for the way,\nTo begin the journey / might he longer not delay.",
        "1163",
        "At Bechelaren waited / Gotelinde there,\nAnd eke the young margravine, / daughter of Ruediger,\nWas glad at thought her father / and all his men to see.\nAnd many a lovely maiden / looked to the coming joyfully.",
        "1164",
        "Ere that to Bechelaren / rode noble Ruediger\nFrom out Vienna city, / was rich equipment there\nFor them in fullest measure / on carrying-horses brought,\nThat went in such wise guarded / that robber hand disturbed them not.",
        "1165",
        "When they at Bechelaren / within the town did stand,\nHis fellows on the journey / did the host command\nTo lead to fitting quarters / and tend carefully.\nThe stately Gotelinde, / glad she was her spouse to see.",
        "1166",
        "Eke his lovely daughter / the youthful margravine,–\nTo her had nothing dearer / than his coming been.\nThe warriors too from Hunland, / what joy for her they make!\nWith a laughing spirit / to all the noble maiden spake:",
        "1167",
        "“Be now to us right welcome, / my father and all his men.\"\nFairest thanks on all sides / saw ye offered then\nUnto the youthful margravine / by many a valiant knight.\nHow Ruediger was minded / knew Gotelinde aright.",
        "1168",
        "When then that night she / by Ruediger lay,\nQuestioned him the margravine / in full loving way,\nWherefore had sent him thither / the king of Hunland.\nHe spake: “My Lady Gotelinde, / that shalt thou gladly understand.",
        "1169",
        "“My master now hath sent me / to woo him other wife,\nSince that by death was ended / the fair Helke’s life.\nNow will I to Kriemhild / ride unto the Rhine:\nShe shall here in Hunland / be spouse to him and stately queen.”",
        "1170",
        "“God will it,” spake Gotelinde, / “and well the same might be,\nSince that so high in honor / ever standeth she.\nThe death of my good mistress / we then may better bear;\nEke might we grant her gladly / among the Huns a crown to wear.”",
        "1171",
        "Then spake to her the margrave: / “Thou shalt, dear lady mine,\nTo them that shall ride with me / thither unto the Rhine,\nIn right bounteous manner / deal out a goodly share.\nGood knights go lighter-hearted / when they well provided fare.”",
        "1172",
        "She spake: “None is among them, / an he would take from me,\nBut I will give whatever / to him may pleasing be,\nEre that ye part thither, / thou and thy good men.\"\nThereto spake the margrave: / “So dost thou all my wishes then.”",
        "1173",
        "Silken stuffs in plenty / they from her chamber bore,\nAnd to the knights full noble / dealt out in goodly store,\nMantles lined all richly / from collar down to spur.\nWhat for the journey pleased him / did choose therefrom Sir Ruediger.",
        "1174",
        "Upon the seventh morning / from Bechelaren went\nThe knight with train of warriors. / Attire and armament\nBore they in fullest measure / through the Bavarian land,\nAnd ne’er upon the journey / dared assail them robber band.",
        "1175",
        "Unto the Rhine then came they / ere twelve days were flown,\nAnd there were soon the tidings / of their coming known.\n’Twas told unto the monarch / and with him many a man,\nHow strangers came unto him. / To question then the king began,",
        "1176",
        "If any was did know them, / for he would gladly hear.\nThey saw their carrying-horses / right heavy burdens bear:\nThat they were knights of power / knew they well thereby.\nLodgings they made them ready / in the wide city speedily.",
        "1177",
        "When that the strangers / had passed within the gate\nEvery eye did gaze on / the knights that came in state,\nAnd mickle was the wonder / whence to the Rhine they came.\nThen sent the king for Hagen, / if he perchance might know the same.",
        "1178",
        "Then spake he of Tronje: / “These knights I ne’er have seen,\nYet when we now behold them / I’ll tell thee well, I ween,\nFrom whence they now ride hither / unto this country.\nAn I not straightway know them, / from distant land in sooth they be.”",
        "1179",
        "For the guests fit lodgings / now provided were.\nClad in rich apparel / came the messenger,\nAnd to the court his fellows / did bear him company.\nSumptuous attire / wore they, wrought full cunningly.",
        "1180",
        "Then spake the doughty Hagen: / “As far as goes my ken,\nFor that long time the noble / knight I not have seen,\nCome they in such manner / as were it Ruediger,\nThe valiant thane from Hunland, / that leads the stately riders here.”",
        "1181",
        "Then straightway spake the monarch: / “How shall I understand\nThat he of Bechelaren / should come unto this land?\"\nScarce had King Gunther / his mind full spoken there,\nWhen saw full surely Hagen / that ’twas the noble Ruediger.",
        "1182",
        "He and his friends then hastened / with warmest welcoming.\nThen saw ye knights five hundred / adown from saddle spring,\nAnd were those knights of Hunland / received in fitting way.\nMessengers ne’er beheld ye / attired in so fine array.",
        "1183",
        "Hagen of Tronje, / with voice full loud spake he:\n“Unto these thanes full noble / a hearty welcome be,\nTo the lord of Bechelaren / and his men every one.\"\nThereat was fitting honor / done to every valiant Hun.",
        "1184",
        "The monarch’s nearest kinsmen / went forth the guests to meet.\nOf Metz the knight Sir Ortwein / Ruediger thus did greet:\n“The while our life hath lasted, / never yet hath guest\nHere been seen so gladly: / be that in very truth confessed.”",
        "1185",
        "For that greeting thanked they / the brave knights one and all.\nWith train of high attendants / they passed unto the hall,\nWhere valiant men a many / stood round the monarch’s seat.\nThe king arose from settle / in courteous way the guests to greet.",
        "1186",
        "Right courteously he greeted / then the messenger.\nGunther and Gernot, / full busy both they were\nFor stranger and companions / a welcome fit to make.\nThe noble knight Sir Ruediger / by the hand the king did take.",
        "1187",
        "He led him to the settle / where himself he sat:\nHe bade pour for the strangers / (a welcome work was that)\nMead the very choicest / and the best of wine,\nThat e’er ye might discover / in all the lands about the Rhine.",
        "1188",
        "Giselher and Gere / joined the company too,\nEke Dankwart and Volker, / when that they knew\nThe coming of the strangers: / glad they were of mood,\nAnd greeted ’fore the monarch / fair the noble knights and good.",
        "1189",
        "Then spake unto his master / of Tronje the knight:\n“Let our thanes seek ever / fully to requite\nWhat erstwhile the margrave / in love to us hath done:\nFair Gotelinde’s husband / our gratitude full well hath won.”",
        "1190",
        "Thereto spake King Gunther: / “Withhold it not I may.\nHow they both do bear them, / tell me now, I pray,\nEtzel and Helke / afar in Hunland.\"\nThen answered him the margrave: / “Fain would I have thee understand.”",
        "1191",
        "Then rose he from the settle / and his men every one.\nHe spake unto the monarch: / “An may the thing be done,\nAnd is’t thy royal pleasure, / so will I naught withhold,\nBut the message that I bring thee / shall full willingly be told.”",
        "1192",
        "He spake: “What tale soever, / doth this thy message make,\nI grant thee leave to tell it, / nor further counsel take.\nNow shalt thou let us hear it, / me and my warriors too,\nFor fullest leave I grant thee / thy high purpose to pursue.”",
        "1193",
        "Then spake the upright messenger: / “Hither to thee at Rhine\nDoth faithful service tender / master high of mine;\nTo all thy kinsmen likewise, / as many as may be:\nEke is this my message / borne in all good will to thee.",
        "1194",
        "“To thee the noble monarch / bids tell his tale of need.\nHis folk ’s forlorn and joyless; / my mistress high is dead,\nHelke the full stately / my good master’s wife,\nWhereby now is orphaned / full many a fair maiden’s life,",
        "1195",
        "“Children of royal parents / for whom hath cared her hand:\nThereby doth the country / in plight full sorry stand.\nAlack, nor is there other / that them with love may tend.\nI ween the time long distant / eke when the monarch’s grief shall end.”",
        "1196",
        "“God give him meed,” spake Gunther, / “that he so willingly\nDoth offer thus good service / to my kinsmen and to me–\nI joy that I his greeting / here have heard this day–\nThe which with glad endeavor / my kinsmen and my men shall pay.”",
        "1197",
        "Thereto the knight of Burgundy, / the valiant Gernot, said:\n“The world may ever rue it / that Helke fair lies dead,\nSo manifold the virtues / that did her life adorn.\"\nA willing testimony / by Hagen to the words was borne.",
        "1198",
        "Thereto again spake Ruediger / the noble messenger:\n“Since thou, O king, dost grant it, / shalt thou now further hear\nWhat message ’tis my master / beloved hath hither sent,\nFor that since death of Helke / his days he hath in sorrow spent.",
        "1199",
        "“’Tis told my lord that Kriemhild / doth widowed live alone,\nAnd dead is doughty Siegfried. / May now such thing be done,\nAnd wilt thou grant that favor, / a crown she then shall wear\nBefore the knights of Etzel: / this message from my lord I bear.”",
        "1200",
        "Then spake the mighty monarch / –a king he was of grace–\n“My will in this same matter / she’ll hear, an so she please.\nThereof will I instruct thee / ere three days are passed by–\nEre I her mind have sounded, / wherefore to Etzel this deny?”",
        "1201",
        "Meanwhile for the strangers / bade they make cheer the best\nIn sooth so were they tended / that Ruediger confessed\nHe had ’mong men of Gunther / of friends a goodly store.\nHagen full glad did serve him, / as he had Hagen served of yore.",
        "1202",
        "Thus there did tarry Ruediger / until the third day.\nThe king did counsel summon / –he moved in wisest way–\nIf that unto his kinsmen / seemed it fitting thing,\nThat Kriemhild take unto her / for spouse Etzel the king.",
        "1203",
        "Together all save Hagen / did the thing advise,\nAnd unto King Gunther / spake he in this wise:\n“An hast thou still thy senses, / of that same thing beware,\nThat, be she ne’er so willing, / thou lend’st thyself her will to share.”",
        "1204",
        "“Wherefore,” spake then Gunther, / “should I allow it not?\nWhene’er doth fortune favor / Kriemhild in aught,\nThat shall I gladly grant her, / for sister dear is she.\nYea, ought ourselves to seek it, / might it but her honor be.”",
        "1205",
        "Thereto gave answer Hagen: / “Now such words give o’er.\nWere Etzel known unto thee / as unto me of yore,\nAnd did’st thou grant her to him, / as ’tis thy will I hear,\nThen wouldst thou first have reason / for thy later weal to fear.”",
        "1206",
        "“Wherefore?” spake then Gunther. / “Well may I care for that,\nE’er to thwart his temper / that so I aught of hate\nAt his hands should merit, / an if his wife she be.\"\nThereto gave answer Hagen: / “Such counsel hast thou ne’er of me.”",
        "1207",
        "Then did they bid for Gernot / and Giselher to go,\nFor wished they of the royal / twain their mind to know,\nIf that the mighty monarch / Kriemhild for spouse should take.\nYet Hagen and none other / thereto did opposition make.",
        "1208",
        "Then spake of Burgundy / Giselher the thane:\n“Well may’st thou now, friend Hagen, / show upright mind again:\nFor sorrows wrought upon her / may’st thou her well requite.\nHowe’er she findeth fortune, / ne’er should it be in thy despite.”",
        "1209",
        "“Yea, hast thou to my sister / so many sorrows done,\"\nSo spake further Giselher, / the full noble thane,\n“That fullest reason hath she / to mete thee naught but hate.\nIn sooth was never lady / than she bereft of joy more great.”",
        "1210",
        "“What I do know full certain, / that known to all I make:\nIf e’er shall come the hour / that she do Etzel take,\nShe’ll work us yet sore evil, / howe’er the same she plan.\nThen in sooth will serve her / full many a keen and doughty man.”",
        "1211",
        "In answer then to Hagen / the brave Gernot said:\n“With us doth lie to leave it / until they both be dead,\nEre that we ride ever / unto Etzel’s land.\nThat we be faithful to her / doth honor meantime sure command.”",
        "1212",
        "Thereto again spake Hagen: / “Gainsay me here may none.\nAnd shall the noble Kriemhild / e’er sit ’neath Helke’s crown,\nHowe’er she that accomplish, / she’ll do us grievous hurt.\nGood knights, therefrom to keep you / doth better with your weal\n      consort.”",
        "1213",
        "In anger spake then Giselher / the son of Ute the fair:\n“None shall yet among us / himself like traitor bear.\nWhat honor e’er befall her, / rejoice thereat should we.\nWhate’er thou sayest, Hagen, / true helper shall she find in me.”",
        "1214",
        "When that heard it Hagen / straightway waxed he wroth.\nGernot and Giselher / the knights high-minded both,\nAnd Gunther, mighty monarch, / did counsel finally,\nIf that did wish it Kriemhild, / by them ’twould unopposed be.",
        "1215",
        "Then spake the margrave Gere: / “That lady will I tell\nHow that of royal Etzel / she may think full well.\nIn fear are subject to him / brave warriors many a one:\nWell may he recompense her / for wrong that e’er to her was done.”",
        "1216",
        "Then went the knight full valiant / where he did Kriemhild find,\nAnd straightway spake unto her / upon her greeting kind:\n“Me may’st thou gladly welcome / with messengers high meed.\nFortune hath come to part thee / now from all thy bitter need.",
        "1217",
        "“For sake of love he bears thee, / lady, doth seek thy hand\nOne of all the highest / that e’er o’er monarch’s land\nDid rule in fullest honor, / or ever crown might wear:\nHigh knights do bring the message, / which same thy brother bids thee\n      hear.”",
        "1218",
        "Then spake she rich in sorrow: / “Now God forbid to thee\nAnd all I have of kinsmen / that aught of mockery\nThey do on me, poor woman. / What were I unto one,\nWho e’er at heart the joyance / of a noble wife hath known?”",
        "1219",
        "Much did she speak against it. / Anon as well came there\nGernot her brother / and the young Giselher.\nIn loving wise they begged her / her mourning heart to cheer:\nAn would she take the monarch, / verily her weal it were.",
        "1220",
        "Yet might not then by any / the lady’s mind be bent,\nThat any man soever / to love she would consent.\nThereon the thanes besought her: / “Now grant the thing to be,\nAn dost thou nothing further, / that the messenger thou deign’st to see.”",
        "1221",
        "“That will I not deny you,\" / spake the high lady,\n“That the noble Ruediger / I full gladly see,\nSuch knightly grace adorns him. / Were he not messenger,\nAnd came there other hither / by him I all unspoken were.”",
        "1222",
        "She spake: “Upon the morrow / bid him hither fare\nUnto this my chamber. / Then shall he fully hear\nHow that do stand my wishes, / the which I’ll tell him true.\"\nOf her full grievous sorrow / was she minded thus anew.",
        "1223",
        "Eke not else desired / the noble Ruediger\nThan that by the lady / leave thus granted were:\nHe knew himself so skilful, / might he such favor earn,\nSo should he her full certain / from her spoken purpose turn.",
        "1224",
        "Upon the morrow early / when that the mass was sung\nCame the noble messengers, / whereof a mickle throng.\nThey that should Sir Ruediger / to court bear company,\nMany a man full stately / in rich apparel might ye see.",
        "1225",
        "Kriemhild, dame high-stated, / –full sad she was of mood–\nThere Ruediger awaited, / the noble knight and good.\nHe found her in such raiment / as daily she did wear:\nThe while were her attendants / in dresses clad full rich and rare,",
        "1226",
        "Unto the threshold went she / the noble guest to meet,\nAnd the man of Etzel / did she full kindly greet.\nTwelve knights there did enter, / himself and eleven more,\nAnd well were they received: / to her such guests came ne’er before.",
        "1227",
        "The messenger to seat him / and his men they gave command.\nThe twain valiant margraves / saw ye before her stand,\nEckewart and Gere, / the noble knights and keen,\nSuch was the lady’s sorrow, / none saw ye there of cheerful mien.",
        "1228",
        "They saw before her sitting / full many a lady fair,\nAnd yet the Lady Kriemhild / did naught but sorrow there.\nThe dress upon her bosom / was wet with tears that fell,\nAnd soon the noble margrave / perceived her mickle grief full well.",
        "1229",
        "Then spake the lofty messenger: / “Daughter of king full high,\nTo me and these my fellows / that bear me company\nDeign now the grace to grant us / that we before thee stand\nAnd tell to thee the tidings / wherefore we rode unto thy land.”",
        "1230",
        "“That grace to thee is granted,\" / spake the lofty queen;\n“Whate’er may be thy message, / I’ll let it now be seen\nThat I do hear it gladly: / thou’rt welcome messenger.\"\nThat fruitless was their errand / deemed the others well to hear.",
        "1231",
        "Then spake of Bechelaren / the noble Ruediger:\n“Pledge of true love unto thee / from lofty king I bear,\nEtzel who bids thee, lady, / here royal compliment:\nHe hath to woo thy favor / knights full worthy hither sent.",
        "1232",
        "“His love to thee he offers / full heartily and free:\nFidelity that lasteth / he plighteth unto thee,\nAs erst to Lady Helke / who o’er his heart held sway.\nYea, thinking on her virtues / hath he full oft had joyless day.”",
        "1233",
        "Then spake the royal lady: / “O Margrave Ruediger,\nIf that known to any / my sharp sorrows were,\nBesought then were I never / again to take me spouse.\nSuch ne’er was won by lady / as the husband I did lose.”",
        "1234",
        "“What is that sootheth sorrow,\" / the valiant knight replied,\n“An be’t not loving friendship / whene’er that may betide,\nAnd that each mortal choose him / who his delight shall be?\nNaught is that so availeth / to keep the heart from sorrow free.",
        "1235",
        "“Wilt thou minded be to love him, / this noble master mine,\nO’er mighty crowns a dozen / the power shall be thine.\nThereto of princes thirty / my lord shall give thee land,\nThe which hath all subdued / the prowess of his doughty hand.",
        "1236",
        "“O’er many a knight full worthy / eke mistress shalt thou be\nThat my Lady Helke / did serve right faithfully,\nAnd over many a lady / that served amid her train,\nOf high and royal lineage,\" / spake the keen and valiant thane.",
        "1237",
        "“Thereto my lord will give thee / –he bids to thee make known–\nIf that beside the monarch / thou deign’st to wear a crown,\nPower in fullest measure / that Helke e’er might boast:\nThe same in lordly manner / shalt thou wield o’er Etzel’s host.”",
        "1238",
        "Then spake the royal lady: / “How might again my life\nHave thereof desire / to be a hero’s wife?\nHath death in one already / wrought me such sorrows sore,\nThat joyless must my days be / from this time for evermore.”",
        "1239",
        "Then spake the men of Hunland: / “O royal high lady,\nThy life shall there by Etzel / so full of honor be\nThy heart ’twill ever gladden / if but may be such thing:\nFull many a thane right stately / doth homage to the mighty king.",
        "1240",
        "“Might but Helke’s maidens / and they that wait on thee\nE’er be joined together / in one royal company,\nWell might brave knights to see them / wax merry in their mood.\nBe, lady, now persuaded / –’tis verily thy surest good.”",
        "1241",
        "She spake in courteous manner: / “Let further parley be\nUntil doth come the morrow. / Then hither come to me.\nSo will I give my answer / to bear upon your way.\"\nThe noble knights and worthy / must straight therein her will obey.",
        "1242",
        "When all from thence were parted / and had their lodgings sought,\nThen bade the noble lady / that Giselher be brought,\nAnd eke with him her mother. / To both she then did tell\nThat meet for her was weeping, / and naught might fit her mood so well.",
        "1243",
        "Then spake her brother Giselher: / “Sister, to me ’tis told–\nAnd well may I believe it– / that thy grief manifold\nEtzel complete will scatter, / an tak’st thou him for man.\nWhate’er be other’s counsel, / meseems it were a thing well done.”",
        "1244",
        "Further eke spake Giselher: / “Console thee well may he.\nFrom Rhone unto Rhine river, / from Elbe unto the sea,\nKing there is none other / that holds so lordly sway.\nAn he for spouse do take thee, / gladden thee full well he may.”",
        "1245",
        "“Brother loved full dearly, / wherefore dost counsel it?\nTo mourn and weep forever / doth better me befit.\nHow may I ’mid warriors / appear in royal state?\nWas ever fair my body, / of beauty now ’tis desolate.”",
        "1246",
        "Then spake the Lady Ute / her daughter dear unto:\n“The thing thy brother counsels, / my loving child, that do.\nBy thy friends be guided, / then with thee well ’twill be.\nLong time it now hath grieved me / thee thus disconsolate to see.”",
        "1247",
        "Then prayed she God with fervor / that he might her provide\nWith store of gold and silver / and raiment rich beside,\nAs erstwhile when her husband / did live a stately thane:\nSince then so happy hour / never had she known again.",
        "1248",
        "In her own bosom thought she: / “An shall I not deny\nMy body to a heathen / –a Christian lady I–\nSo must I while life lasteth / have shame to be my own.\nAn gave he realms unnumbered, / such thing by me might ne’er be done.”",
        "1249",
        "And there withal she left it. / The night through until day,\nUpon her couch the lady / with mind full troubled lay.\nNor yet her eyes full shining / of tears at all were free,\nUntil upon the morrow / forth to matins issued she.",
        "1250",
        "When for mass was sounded, / came there the kings likewise.\nAgain did they their sister / by faithful word advise\nTo take for spouse unto her / of Hunland the king.\nAll joyless was the visage / they saw the lady thither bring.",
        "1251",
        "They bade the men of Etzel / thither lead again,\nWho unto their country / fain their leave had ta’en,\nTheir message won or fruitless, / how that soe’er might be.\nUnto the court came Ruediger. / Full eager were his company",
        "1252",
        "By the knight to be informed / how the thing befell,\nAnd if betimes they knew it / ’twould please them all full well,\nFor weary was the journey / and long unto their land.\nSoon did the noble Ruediger / again in Kriemhild’s presence stand.",
        "1253",
        "In full earnest manner / then the knight gan pray\nThe high royal lady / that she to him might say\nWhat were from her the message / to Etzel he should bear.\nNaught but denial only / did he from the lady hear,",
        "1254",
        "For that her love might never / by man again be won.\nThereto spake the margrave: / “Ill such thing were done.\nWherefore such fair body / wilt thou to ruin give?\nSpouse of knight full worthy / may’st thou yet in honor live.”",
        "1255",
        "Naught booted how they besought her, / till that Ruediger\nSpake in secret manner / in the high lady’s ear,\nHow Etzel should requite her / for ills she e’er did know.\nThen gan her mickle sorrow / milder at the thought to grow.",
        "1256",
        "Unto the queen then spake he: / “Let now thy weeping be.\nIf ’mong the Huns hadst thou / other none than me\nAnd my faithful kinsmen / and my good men alone,\nSorely must he repay it / who hath aught to thee of evil done.”",
        "1257",
        "Thereat apace all lighter / the lady’s sorrow grew,\nShe spake: “So swear thou truly, / what any ’gainst me do,\nThat thou wilt be the foremost / my sorrows to requite.\"\nThereto spake the margrave: / “Lady, to thee my word I plight.”",
        "1258",
        "With all his men together / sware then Ruediger\nFaithfully to serve her, / and in all things whatsoe’er\nNaught would e’er deny her / the thanes from Etzel’s land,\nWhereof she might have honor: / thereto gave Ruediger his hand.",
        "1259",
        "Then thought the faithful lady: / “Since I thus have won\nBand of friends so faithful, / care now have I none\nHow shall speak the people / in my sore need of me.\nThe death of my loved husband / perchance shall yet avenged be.”",
        "1260",
        "Thought she: “Since hath Etzel / so many knights and true,\nAn shall I but command them, / whate’er I will I do.\nEke hath he such riches / that free may be my hand:\nBereft of all my treasure / by Hagen’s faithless art I stand.”",
        "1261",
        "Then spake she unto Ruediger: / “Were it not, as I do know,\nThe king is yet a heathen, / so were I fain to go\nWhithersoe’er he willed it, / and take him for my lord.\"\nThereto spake the margrave: / “Lady, no longer hold such word.",
        "1262",
        "“Such host he hath of warriors / who Christians are as we,\nThat beside the monarch / may care ne’er come to thee.\nYea, may he be baptized / through thee to Christian life:\nWell may’st thou then rejoice thee / to be the royal Etzel’s wife.”",
        "1263",
        "Then spake again her brother: / “Sister, thy favor lend,\nThat now all thy sorrow / thereby may have an end.\"\nAnd so long they besought her / that full of sadness she\nHer word at length had plighted / the monarch Etzel’s wife to be.",
        "1264",
        "She spake: “You will I follow, / I most lorn lady,\nThat I fare to Hunland, / as soon as it may be\nThat I friends have ready / to lead me to his land.\"\nBefore the knights assembled / fair Kriemhild pledged thereto her hand.",
        "1265",
        "Then spake again the margrave: / “Two knights do serve thee true,\nAnd I thereof have many: / ’tis easy thing to do,\nThat thee with fitting honor / across the Rhine we guide.\nNor shalt thou, lady, longer / here in Burgundy abide.",
        "1266",
        "“Good men have I five hundred, / and eke my kinsmen stand\nReady here to serve thee / and far in Etzel’s land,\nLady, at thy bidding. / And I do pledge the same,\nWhene’er thou dost admonish, / to serve thee without cause for shame.",
        "1267",
        "“Now bid with full equipment / thy horses to prepare:\nRuediger’s true counsel / will bring thee sorrow ne’er;\nAnd tell it to thy maidens / whom thou wilt take with thee.\nFull many a chosen warrior / on the way shall join our company.”",
        "1268",
        "They had full rich equipment / that once their train arrayed\nThe while that yet lived Siegfried, / so might she many a maid\nIn honor high lead with her, / as she thence would fare.\nWhat steeds all rich caparisoned / awaited the high ladies there!",
        "1269",
        "If till that time they ever / in richest dress were clad,\nThereof now for their journey / full store was ready made,\nFor that they of the monarch / had such tidings caught.\nFrom chests longtime well bolted / forth the treasures rich were brought.",
        "1270",
        "Little were they idle / until the fifth day,\nBut sought rich dress that folded / secure in covers lay.\nKriemhild wide did open / all her treasure there,\nAnd largess great would give she / unto the men of Ruediger.",
        "1271",
        "Still had she of the treasure / of Nibelungenland,\n(She weened the same in Hunland / to deal with bounteous hand)\nSo great that hundred horses / ne’er the whole might bear.\nHow stood the mind of Kriemhild, / came the tidings unto Hagen’s ear.",
        "1272",
        "He spake: “Since Kriemhild never / may me in favor hold,\nE’en so here must tarry / Siegfried’s store of gold.\nWherefore unto mine enemies / such mickle treasure go?\nWhat with the treasure Kriemhild / intendeth, that full well I know.",
        "1273",
        "“Might she but take it thither, / in sooth believe I that,\n’Twould be dealt out in largess / to stir against me hate.\nNor own they steeds sufficient / the same to bear away.\n’Twill safe be kept by Hagen / –so shall they unto Kriemhild say.”",
        "1274",
        "When she did hear the story, / with grief her heart was torn.\nEke unto the monarchs / all three the tale was borne.\nFain would they prevent it: / yet when that might not be,\nSpake the noble Ruediger / in this wise full joyfully:",
        "1275",
        "“Wherefore, queen full stately, / weep’st thou o’er this gold?\nFor thee will King Etzel / in such high favor hold\nWhen but his eyes behold thee, / to thee such store he’ll give\nThat ne’er thou may’st exhaust it: / that, lady, by my word believe.”",
        "1276",
        "Thereto the queen gave answer: / “Full noble Ruediger,\nGreater treasure never / king’s daughter had for share\nThan this that Hagen from me / now hath ta’en away.\"\nThen went her brother Gernot / to the chamber where the treasure lay.",
        "1277",
        "With force he stuck the monarch’s / key into the door,\nAnd soon of Kriemhild’s treasure / they from the chamber bore\nMarks full thirty thousand / or e’en more plenteously.\nHe bade the guests to take it, / which pleased King Gunther well to see.",
        "1278",
        "Then Gotelinde’s husband / of Bechelaren spake:\n“An if my Lady Kriemhild / with her complete might take\nWhat treasure e’er came hither / from Nibelungenland,\nNe’er a whit would touch it / mine or my royal lady’s hand.",
        "1279",
        "“Now bid them here to keep it, / for ne’er the same I’ll touch.\nYea brought I from my country / of mine own wealth so much,\nThat we upon our journey / may be full well supplied,\nAnd ne’er have lack in outlay / as in state we homeward ride.”",
        "1280",
        "Chests well filled a dozen / from the time of old\nHad for their own her maidens, / of the best of gold\nThat e’er ye might discover: / now thence away ’twas borne,\nAnd jewels for the ladies / upon the journey to be worn.",
        "1281",
        "Of the might she yet was fearful / of Hagen grim and bold.\nStill had she of mass-money / a thousand marks in gold,\nThat gave she for the soul’s rest / of her husband dear.\nSuch loving deed and faithful / did touch the heart of Ruediger.",
        "1282",
        "Then spake the lady mournful: / “Who now that loveth me,\nAnd for the love they bear me / may willing exiles be,\nWho with me to Hunland / now away shall ride?\nTake they of my treasure / and steeds and meet attire provide.”",
        "1283",
        "Then did the margrave Eckewart / answer thus the queen:\n“Since I from the beginning / of thy train have been,\nHave I e’er right faithful / served thee,” spake the thane,\n“And to the end I’ll ever / thus faithful unto thee remain.",
        "1284",
        "“Eke will I lead with me / five hundred of my men,\nWhom I grant to serve thee / in faithful way again.\nNor e’er shall we be parted / till that we be dead.\"\nLow bowing thanked him Kriemhild, / as verily might be his meed.",
        "1285",
        "Forth were brought the horses, / for that they thence would fare.\nThen was a mickle weeping / of friends that parted there.\nUte, queen full stately, / and many a lady more\nShowed that from Lady Kriemhild / to part did grieve their hearts full\n      sore.",
        "1286",
        "A hundred stately maidens / with her she led away,\nAnd as for them was fitting, / full rich was their array.\nMany a bitter tear-drop / from shining eye fell down:\nYet joys knew they full many / eke in Etzel’s land anon.",
        "1287",
        "Thither came Sir Giselher / and Gernot as well,\nAnd with them train of followers, / as duty did compel.\nSafe escort would they furnish / for their dear sister then,\nAnd with them led of warriors / a thousand brave and stately men.",

        "Then came the valiant Gere, / and Ortwein eke came he:\nRumold the High Steward / might not absent be.\nUnto the Danube did they / night-quarters meet provide.\nShort way beyond the city / did the royal Gunther ride.",
