        "OUT OF THE DARKNESS",
        "There was no measure of time for Ryder in that walled coffin of\ndeath. The seconds seemed hours, the minutes ages.",
        "He drew quick, short breaths as if economizing the air that was so\nsoon to fail him; he tugged at his bonds till the veins rose on his\nforehead, but the silk held and the confines of the prison permitted\nhim no room for struggle; then he leaned forward, to press with all\nhis might upon the bricks before him; he grunted, he sweated with\nthe agony of his exertions, but not a brick was stirred, not a crack\nwas made in the mortar that gripped them tighter every instant.",
        "He died a thousand deaths in the horror that invaded him then.\nAlready he felt strangling, and the painful pumping of his heart\nseemed the beginning of the end.",
        "Cold sweat stood out all over him; it ran down his face in trickling\nstreams and his body was drenched with that clammy dew of fear.",
        "He tried to count the minutes, the hours, to estimate how long he\nwould hold out....",
        "And then he heard his own voice saying very distinctly and clearly\nand dispassionately, “This thing is absurd.”",
        "It was absurd. It was idiotic. It was utterly irrational. It was an\nimpossible end for an able-bodied young American, an excavator of no\nmean attainments, a young scholar and explorer of twentieth century\nscience, a sane, modern, harmless young man, to die immured in the\nancient walls of a Turkish palace–because he had invaded a marriage\nreception and intervened between man and wife.",
        "Violent death in any form must always appear absurd to the young and\nenergetic. And the fantastic horror of his death removed it\ndefinitely from any realm of possibility. The thing simply could not\nhappen.... He thought of the amazement and the incredulity of his\nfriends....",
        "Dangers in plenty they had warned him against, to his youthful\namusement–sand storms and chills and raw fruit and unboiled waters,\nbut they had not warned him against veiled women and the resentments\nof outraged lords and masters.",
        "He thought of his mother’s consternation and dismay. He thought of\nhis father’s stern amazement.... What an awful jolt it would give\nthem, he reflected, with an irrational tickling of young humor.",
        "But no, it would not. They would never know. Not a word of this fate\nwould percolate into the world without. Not a comment upon his true\nend would enliven the daily columns of the East Middleton\nMonitor. Never would it regret the tragic and romantic interment\nof a young native son of talent, buried alive by a revengeful\ngeneral of the Sultan....",
        "He amused himself by writing the paragraph that would never be\nwritten. Then he told himself that he was lightheaded and hysterical\nand that he had better wonder what would actually be written. What\nexplanation would be found?",
        "A desert storm perhaps, or some accident. McLean would poke\nabout–but for all McLean knew he might be on his way back to camp\nthat very moment. And sometimes he went by sailing canoe, and a\nrented horse, and sometimes by the accredited steamer and a camel,\nand sometimes by tram or train to the nearest station. Even McLean’s\nmind and McLean’s Copts wouldn’t make much of all the alternatives\nthat his unsettled habits had afforded.",
        "Was there any possibility of his being traced, of any rescue\nreaching him? He thought hard and long upon his last free moments.\nJinny Jeffries knew that he was in the palace, and Jinny had been\nreiteratedly warned about the danger of betraying that knowledge. It\nwould take some little time for alarm before Jinny said anything.\nAnd it would take a little time for Jinny to begin to worry.",
        "He had not been so instant in attendance upon Jinny of late, for all\ntheir residence in the same hotel, that she would suspect that his\nabsence of twenty-four hours was due to actual incarceration.",
        "His cursed passion for freedom in which to ramble up and down that\ndeserted lane without Tewfick Pasha’s garden! His inane love of\nsolitary mooning....",
        "No, Jinny would not soon wonder about him. She had not expected to\nsee him that evening, anyway–he had muttered something to her about\na man and an engagement.",
        "She would rather look to see him the next day and talk about their\nadventure.... But still she would feel no more than pique at his\nabsence; positive worry would not develop until later.",
        "Besides, all the revelations that Jinny could make would do no good.\nJinny could only report that he had maintained a disguise at a\nwedding reception, and talked a few moments, apparently undetected,\nto a bride. Hamdi Bey, and Hamdi’s eunuchs, would be blandly\nignorant of such a scandal. What his disappearance would indicate\nwould be some further frolic on his part, some tempting of a later\nProvidence before he had abandoned his disguise.... If he were\ndiscovered, for instance, in some of those native quarters, behind a\nwoman’s veil....",
        "Decidedly the only effect of Jinny’s revelations would be an\nunsavory cloud upon his character.",
        "There was no hope to be looked for.",
        "And yet he could not believe it. There were moments when the black\nterror mastered him, but involuntarily his young strength shook it\noff. He could not believe in its reality. He could not believe that\nhe was actually here, bricked and bound, in this infernal coffin....",
        "But, indisputably, the evidence was in favor of belief.... Only to\nbelieve was to feel again that horror....",
        "He tried to tell himself that it didn’t matter. One had to die some\ntime. Everybody did. One might as well go out young and strong and\nstill interested in life.",
        "But that was remarkably cold comfort. He didn’t want to go out at\nall. He didn’t want to die, not for fifty or sixty years yet, and of\nall the ways of dying, he wanted least to smother and choke and\nstifle like a rat walled in its hole in the wall.",
        "He recalled, with peculiar pain, a woodchuck that he had penned up\nas a boy, and he hoped with extraordinary passion that the poor\nbeast had made another hole. Never again, he resolved, would he pen\nup a living creature, never again, if only again he could see the\nlight of day and breathe the free air....",
        "He thought of Aimée. And when he thought of her his heart seemed to\nturn to water. Useless to repeat to himself now those old reminders\nthat he had seen her so little, known her so slightly. Useless to\nmeasure that strange feeling that drew him by any artifice of time\nand acquaintance.",
        "She was Aimée. She was enchantment and delight. She was appeal and\ntenderness. She was blind longing and mystery. She was beauty and\ndesire....",
        "Even to think of her now, in the infernal horror of this cramping\ngrave, was to feel his heart quicken and his blood grow hot in a\nhelpless passion of dread and fear. She was alone, there, helpless,\nwith that madman.",
        "He tried to tell himself that she was not wholly helpless, that she\nhad wit and spirit and courage, and that somehow she would manage to\nquell the storm; she might persuade Hamdi to their story, make him\nremember that this was the twentieth century wherein one does not go\nabout immuring inconvenient trespassers as in the earlier years of\nthe Mad Khedive–years which had probably formed the general’s\nimpulses–but in telling himself this there was no comfort for the\nthought of the price that Aimée would have to pay.",
        "It was pleasanter to pretend that Hamdi was really only joking, in a\nshockingly exaggerated, practical way, and that presently, when the\nsuitable time had elapsed, he would present himself, smiling, to end\nthe ghastly, antiquated jest.",
        "For some time he continued to tell himself that.",
        "And then suddenly he told himself that the time for intervention had\nsurely come. It was very hard to breathe.",
        "The next minute he was assuring himself that this was merely some\ndevil’s trick of his apprehensive imagination. There must be a\ngreat deal of air left.... But he was distressingly ignorant of the\ncontents of air, and his calculations were lamentably unsupported by\nany sound basis of fact.",
        "Mistake, not to have gone in for chemistry and physics. A chap who’d\ndone time in those subjects wouldn’t now be rocking with suspense;\nhe’d comfortably and satisfactorily know just how many hours,\nminutes and seconds were allotted before his finish and he could\nthink his thoughts accordingly.",
        "Undoubtedly, so he insisted to himself, there was air enough here to\nlast him till morning. This gasping stuff was all imagination. He\nwanted to keep cool and quiet. But for all his reassurance there\nwas something a little queer with his lungs, and his heart was\nlurching sickeningly in his side, like a runaway ship’s engine.",
        "And then he heard his own voice repeating very tonelessly, “O God, O\nGod,” and the horror of it all came blackly over him and a feeling\nof profound and awful sickness....",
        "It was a sound. The faintest scraping and knocking without that\nwall. It went through him like an electric current.... And then a\nroar burst from him that fairly split his ears, the reaction of his\nquivered nerves and racking fears of his uncertainties, his\ntightening terrors.",
        "But now–nothing. He could not hear a thing. A delusion? A torture\nof his final hours?... No, it came again. More definitely now, a\nlittle grinding and scraping.",
        "Faster and faster, a muffled, driving thud.",
        "A jubilant reassurance sang gayly through him. He had expected\nthis–this was what he had predicted. Hamdi was no foul friend. He\nwas a devilish uncomfortable customer with antiquated notions of\nrevenge, but now he had shot his wad and was going to undo his\ntricks.",
        "Ryder braced himself to present a carefree jauntiness–an air\nsomewhat difficult to assume when one is trussed like a spitted\nbird, in a hot coffin space, with hair falling dankly over a\nsteaming brow, with a collar like a string, and an indescribable\npallor beneath the bronze of one’s face.",
        "Something stirred. One end of a brick was driven in against his\nchest. Then he felt the blind working of some tool that caught it\nand worried it free.",
        "It seemed to him that through that dark aperture a current of cold,\ndelicious air came rushing in about him. The blows sounded against\nthe adjoining bricks and he thought of the glorious joy of seeing\nout again, feeling that he would welcome even the sight of Hamdi’s\nblond mustache and the eunuch’s hideous grin.",
        "Now the aperture admitted a pale gleam upon his chest. Staring\nsteadily down he caught a glimpse of the fingers curving about a\nbrick, and his heart that had steadied, began to race again wildly.\nFor they were not the fingers of the black nor yet the wiry joints\nof the general.",
        "They were soft, white fingers, with a gleam of rings.",
        "Aimée! Somehow, somewhere, she had managed to come to him, to\nachieve this rescue....",
        "“Aimée!” He breathed the name.",
        "“S-sh!” came a warning little whisper, and impatiently he waited\nuntil that opening should be greater and permit of sight and speech.",
        "His helplessness was maddening. If only he could raise his hands,\ncould get those bonds off! He twisted, he writhed, he tried to lift\nhis elbows and get his wrists in reach of the opening, but the\ncoffin was too diabolically cramped for movement until the hole was\nvery much larger. Then with a convulsive pressure he swung his\nwrists within reach and after a moment’s wait he felt a thin blade\ndrawn across the silk.",
        "The relief was glorious. He swung his hands free, rubbing the chafed\nwrists, then thrust an opened hand out into the opening, and with\ninstant comprehension a short, pointed bit of iron was put within\nit.",
        "Now he could do something! With furious strength he attacked the\nbricks edging the hole and as he pried free each brick he could\nagain get a glimpse of those white delicate fingers lifting it\ncarefully away.",
        "And now the hole was large enough. He twisted about and thrust out a\nleg, and then, with a feeling of ecstasy which made the official\nliterary raptures of saints and conquerors but pale, dim moods, he\nwormed his way out of that jagged hole and turned, erect and free,\nto the shrouded figure of his rescuer.",
        "She had drawn back a little against the wall, a gauzy veil across\nher face. Beside her, upon the stone floor, a solitary candle sent\nits flickering rays into the shadows, edging with light her slender\noutlines.",
        "Ryder took one quick step to her, his heart in his throat, and put\nout eager arms. But in the very moment that he was gathering her to\nhim, even when he felt her pliant body, at first resistant, then\nsoftly yielding, swept against his own, he felt, too, a little palm\nsuddenly upon his mouth.",
        "“Hsh!” said the soft, whispering voice, cutting into his low murmur\nof “Aimée!” and then, in slow emphatic caution, “Be–careful!”",
        "He had need of that caution. For under the saffron veil was not the\nface of Aimée. He was clasping a young creature that he had never\nseen before, a girl with flaming henna hair and kohl darkened brows,\na vivid blazoning face that smiled enigmatically with a certain\nmockery of delight at the amazement he reflected so unguardedly.",
