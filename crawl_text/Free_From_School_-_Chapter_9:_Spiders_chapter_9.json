        "My stint with vermiculture over, I had another fortnight of study with\nDr K. Vijayalakshmi, whom my dad calls India’s `Spider Woman’. Dr\nVijayalakshmi has been doing research on rearing spiders as a\nbiological weapon for controlling cockroaches and her workplace is full\nof spiders of various types, all in bottles, and bred under her\nsupervision. An authority on spiders, she is also the author of a\nwell-known book on the subject.",
        "Actually I had been anxiously waiting for a phone call from my parents\nsaying that the decks were cleared for my Crocodile Bank visit. Instead\nDad had phoned to say that the final arrangements for my stay at Croc\nBank were still being finalised and that I could use the 10 days or so\nin between to learn what I could from Dr Vijayalakshmi about spiders,\nand the unusual use she intends to put them to. I had readily agreed.",
        "Dr K. Vijayalakshmi and her husband both work in an organisation called\nthe Centre for Indian Knowledge Systems (CIKS). CIKS is housed in a one\nstorey building and Dr Vijayalakshmi’s office is on the first floor.\nHere she studies various plants that are useful as pesticides and so\non. But I was not at all concerned with that aspect of her work.",
        "In the garage of the building was the Spider Room-a laboratory of sorts\nfilled with bottles of different spiders in various stages of growth.\nThere must have been over 500 transparent plastic bottles at the time I\nwas there, each one neatly labelled, and all sitting one next to the\nother with spiders in them. For air, each bottle had tiny pinholes in\nits lid. Feeding was done through another small hole in the lid: this\nhole was plugged with cotton. All these spiders and their activities\nincluding growth, moulting, mating and hatching of babies were\nmonitored by Dr Vijayalakshmi. She had an assistant called Selvan and\nhe followed her instructions, keeping the records and making the\nnotings in a log book.",
        "During the fortnight that I worked with Dr Vijayalakshmi, I simply\nslipped into this set-up, reading books about spiders that Dr\nVijayalakshmi gave me, then learning to identify different spiders and\nsimultaneously helping Selvan in all the tasks that were needed to\nmaintain the huge spider population housed in the garage.",
        "The spiders that Dr Vijayalakshmi deals with are called giant crab\nspiders. These spiders do not build webs. They feed only on\ncockroaches. The spiders were a little smaller than their prey i.e. the\ncockroaches. I used to separate the babies, feed them, check the\nmoultings and catch flies for feeding them. I read a lot of books here\nand sometimes caught the spiders in the garden in order to identify and\nstudy them.",
        "Spiders were not the only creatures housed in the garage. There were\nalso cockroaches bred in buckets with rolled cardboard in the centre\nand broken biscuit pieces thrown in the bucket. The cockroaches were\nfed once a week or so to the giant crab spiders.",
        "The smaller spiders used to get flies to eat and these were caught by\nus everyday from the garden. The flies have to be fed alive to the\nspiders, so we used transparent plastic bottles to trap the flies and\nonce caught we would carefully put them into the spider’s bottle.\nSometimes the spider would immediately catch the prey and eat it; at\nother times the fly would buzz around in the bottle for days till the\nspider was ready to eat it.",
        "Dr Vijayalakshmi also bred a particular species of fly in a small cage\nwith fine mesh with a small saucer of milk in the centre as a medium\nfor breeding.",
        "Baby spiders were also housed individually in bottles and these were\nfed fly larvae or the larvae which come when maida or rava begins to\nlose its freshness.",
        "The purpose of all these experiments was to find out which types of\nspiders were useful for using as pest control agents to deal with\ncockroaches. Information about spiders such as their growth, hardiness,\ntheir eating habits, reproduction etc. are important indicators of the\nspecies of spiders that can be kept in houses as predators for\ncockroaches.",
        "Other than the spider work I tried to learn Tamil from Selvan but he\nwas keen to learn English from me and so both of us failed in learning\na new language and ended up speaking a cocktail of TamEnglish instead.",
        "Extracts from Diary:\nSpiders",
        "26th November: Uncle Mano and I left for Dr Vijayalakshmi’s office this\nmorning at 7 a.m. While Uncle Mano and Madam chatted, I read some\nbooks. Madam then showed us her spider collection. She also introduced\nme to Selvan. Before we left she gave me some books to take home to\nread.",
        "27th November: Watched how Selvan separated baby spiders from their\nmother, placing each baby in a separate container. There were about 110\nbabies. Then we fed about 200 older spider babies. Selvan showed me how\nto check their moulting.",
        "28th November: Today I did feeding of the spider babies on my own. Then\ntransferred adults from one container to another and then fed them.",
        "29th November: Today did only feeding of spider babies. Madam did not\ncome to the office as she was ill but her husband Dr Balasubramanian\ncame to check on us instead. Read some books on spiders in the\nafternoon. Left early for home as Uncle Mano and Aunty Sagu were going\naway for a few days and I would be staying at their relative Santosh\nKumar’s place instead. They left at 7.30 p.m. and I waited at their\nneighbour’s place for Santosh to collect me which he did at 9 p.m.",
        "30th November: Being Sunday I got up late and ate idlis, dosas and\nsambar for breakfast. Wrote out my diary for the past 2 days and\nwatched some TV. In the evening Santosh took me to the bus stand and\nexplained the route I would have to take next morning to CIKS.",
        "1st December: Madam came to the office today and showed me how to\ncollect spiders which were in the compound of the office. She also gave\nme some more material to read on spiders and told me to start preparing\nmy essay on spiders. After doing a little bit of feeding as usual, I\nwent out on my own and collected few species of spiders. Then Madam\nhelped me identify them and also some other species of spiders that\nthey had caught. Spent the afternoon catching flies to feed to some of\nthe older spiders.",
        "2nd December: Today I only did identifying of different species of\nspiders. I took some material home to read and so I left early; was so\nbusy looking at the books I was carrying, I didn’t notice the terminus\nwhere I was to get off and got over carried much further. Had to walk\nnearly half an hour back. Asked people for directions and finally\nreached the terminus.",
        "3rd December: Did not feel well today so I didn’t go to CIKS. Read the\nbooks I had brought at home. Started preparing my written report.",
        "4th December: Today did feeding of spiders as usual. Then caught about\n70 flies and fed them to the adult spiders. Put 2 spiders to mate and\nmade my observations. Continued writing my report in the evening.",
        "5th December: Went to New College to collect my vermiculture report.",
        "6th December: Did feeding of baby spiders first. Then caught flies. A\nfemale spider’s eggs had just hatched so Selvan and I did the\nseparation of the babies into individual containers.",
        "7th December: Did writing of my report first today. Then I gave it to\nMadam to correct. After she finished with it, I started writing it in\nfair. I finished writing the report before evening and left it with\nMadam for final approval.",
        "8th December: Went to CIKS late as I had a bad stomach. I was given my\nfinal report signed and Madam also gave me a certificate. I left\nslightly early in the evening as I was still feeling unwell and was\nscheduled to leave for the Croc Bank the next day.",
        "Field Work Notes:\nSpiders",
        "These days most of us use Baygon or some other synthetic poison to\ncontrol cockroaches and other pests. But what does this do? It only\nmakes cockroaches or pests immune or resistant to such poisons.\nMoreover, synthetic chemicals are very harmful and pollute the\nenvironment. How nice it would be if we had a biological method of\ncontrolling of pests. But that’s just what spiders are!",
        "A spider is not an insect. Insects are made up of a head, thorax and an\nabdomen. They have compound eyes and are six-legged. They usually grow\nwings in certain stages of their life and possess feelers or antennae.\nInsects produce eggs which hatch into young that are completely\ndifferent from their parents. The young ones usually grow through\nmetamorphosis.",
        "A spider on the other hand is an arthropod, made up of a cepolothorax\njoined to an abdomen. It does not grow wings at any stage of its life.\nIt is eight-legged, and in place of the normal insect antennae it has\npedipalps. A spider generally has eight simple eyes or it could have\nsix eyes e.g. a spitting spider. Depending on the species the eyesight\nmay be well or poorly developed. Some species, such as the cave\nspiders, are totally blind. Depending on the species a spider’s life\nspan ranges from a couple of months to more than a decade (e.g.\nmygalomorphs).",
        "Almost all spiders have their first pair of appendages later modified\ninto fangs with venom glands. But only a few have fangs that are large\nand strong enough to pierce human skin. Out of these, most cannot do\nany serious damage to human beings except for about four to five\nspecies which can be lethal.",
        "The Black Widow spider, for example, which is found in South America is\nthe most poisonous of all spiders. The female of the species, whose\npoison is strong enough to kill a human being, often kills and eats the\nmale after mating and is thus aptly named the Black Widow. This spider\nis shiny black in colour with a red hour glass mark on the ventricle\nside of the abdomen. Fortunately, there are no spiders in India which\ncan seriously harm human beings.",
        "There are about 30,000 species of spiders in the world. They have been\nfound upto a height of 23,000 feet up Mount Everest as well as\nunderwater.",
        "Almost all spiders are carnivorous. They can eat insects, small birds,\nmammals and reptiles, including poisonous snakes and other spiders,\nwhich they first subdue with their poison. They inject their prey with\na highly lethal venom and, having no teeth, suck out the liquid from\ninside their prey. Large spiders with longer and powerful jaws may eat\npart of or even the whole of their prey. Spiders can live without food\nfrom a few weeks upto three months, depending on species, size, and\nage. They obtain liquid from their food and thus do not need water.",
        "Many spiders spin webs to capture their prey. However spiders also have\nother means of capturing their prey. Some spiders spit a sticky web\nonto their prey. Others live in burrows with trapdoors. Whenever they\nfeel hungry they come out and catch an unsuspecting insect. One species\nattaches a sticky drop to one end of its silken thread and holds it\nwith its first three pairs of legs. When an insect passes by, the\nspider waves the thread at the insect and ropes it in, as it were.",
        "Some spiders sit on flowers and catch insects that come to collect\nnectar. Others spin a small web, hold it with their first few pairs of\nappendages and then throw it on insects passing below them. Still\nothers feed on other spiders only and are called pirate spiders. A few\nspiders live on the webs of other spiders: they are too small to be\neaten by their host. They eat the small prey that get caught in the\nweb, thus keeping it tidy.",
        "Spiders also have amazing defence mechanisms. Some spiders camouflage\nthemselves as a bird dropping. Others, as a dried yellow or black\nrotting leaf or twig. And yet others resemble ants which are often\nrejected by birds, reptiles and other insects. Some are even able to\nchange colour and shape, to some extent, to match their surroundings.\nSome species build zigzag white coloured threads in their webs which\nare visible to birds who avoid flying through the webs and damaging\nthem.",
        "The male spider is smaller than the female, and is thus liable to be\neaten by his mate. So, the male uses many tactics to prevent his being\ndevoured by his mate. In some cases the male drums or pulls at the\nstrings of the web in a special code to announce that he is not a prey\nor an enemy, but a sexual object.",
        "Some spiders offer their mate a gift such as a juicy fly, wrapped in\nsilk. But it may well be taken back after mating and offered to another\nfemale. Sometimes a male may even offer the female the empty husk of an\ninsect. Sometimes the male loosely binds the female with silk to\nimmobilize her before mating. Some species of male spiders may\npatiently wait near the web of a female spider for weeks until she has\ncaught a prey, and then mate with her while she is busy feeding on the\nprey. Sometimes, the male is so small compared to the female that the\nfemale is practically unaware of him while mating and this gives him\nprotection.",
        "Most spiders are solitary in nature. Each one builds its own separate\nweb. If one spider falls by mistake into another web, the bigger spider\nwill eat the smaller spider. However, there are some spiders called\nsocial spiders that live together in one web. Sometimes there may be\nhundreds or even thousands of adults and young ones living in one web.\nEven if a single prey is caught (such as a small fly), all the spiders\nwill share the meal.",
        "Spiders multiply very rapidly. After mating, an egg sac is constructed\nand the internally fertilized eggs laid inside the egg sac which is\ncarried by the female with her palps and fangs. Fertilization of eggs\nmay be internal or external depending on the species. Within 15 to 20\ndays, 80% of the eggs hatch. (The eggs hatch into young spiderlings.\nThe new born spiders are similar to their parents, only smaller. The\nspiderlings moult to mature.) After a gap of one week to ten days the\nnext batch of eggs is laid in a fresh egg sac, and fertilised with the\nhelp of stored sperm. The female can do this three to four times\nwithout mating with another male, although she will readily mate with a\nmale after the laying of every batch of eggs.",
        "Spiders have proven themselves to be one of the best biocontrollers of\ninsect pests. Very few of us realize that spiders were, are and will be\nlaying traps for insects even after man has finally disappeared from\nthe earth.",
        "How to Rear Spiders",
        "Spiders have cannibalistic tendencies, i.e. if two or more are kept in\none container, they will prey on each other. Hence from birth, they\nmust be separated into individual containers.",
        "Transparent plastic containers (size depending on the individual\nspecies) can be used to rear spiders. A few pin-sized holes should be\nmade in the lid of the container as aeration holes. One big hole should\nbe made for dropping prey inside. It should be blocked with a piece of\ncotton.",
        "Baby spiders will eat culture foods such as Thrypolium, drosophilia,\nfruit fly and house fly larvae. As they grow, they will eat house flies\nand later on cockroaches.",
        "Cleaning the prey remains and moults is a must. Two containers should\nbe used. Every week the used one should be washed with soap and water,\nand allowed to dry in the sun.",
        "The legs of the stands on which the spider containers are kept should\nbe placed in bowls of water or oil to avoid ants. The adults should be\nfed well before allowing them to mate. Spiders will tolerate moderate\nroom temperature.",
        "Culturing food",
        "1. Milk powder and a medium sized piece of cotton, mixed with water.\nEvery day, a teaspoon of milk powder should be added.",
        "2. Drosophilia larvae culturing: quarter cup of wheat flour and two\nmedium sized pieces of jaggery should be boiled in two cups of water.",
        "Housefly and drosophilia can be reared in a wooden or metal framed box,\ncovered with a fine mesh or netting. The above mixture should be put\ninto small bowls and introduced into the cage. Adult houseflies and\ndrosophilia should be captured and put inside the cage and left there\nto lay their eggs.",
        "3. Thrypodium larvae: adults are found in rava and maida. A special\nbucket should be kept with an aeration hole and the maida or rava in\nthe bucket, sprinkled with a little bit of water every day. A strainer\ncan be used to strain out the larvae wherever necessary.",
        "4. Cockroaches: need a bucket with many big aeration holes, covered\nwith a fine mesh. A few rolls of paper can be placed vertically inside\nthe box for the cockroaches to climb on.",
