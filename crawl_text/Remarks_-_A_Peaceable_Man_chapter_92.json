        "Will L. Visscher always made a specialty of being a peaceable man. He\nwould make most any sacrifice in order to secure general amnesty. I’ve\nknown him to go around six blocks out of his way, to avoid a stormy\ninterview with a belligerant dog. He was always very tender-hearted about\ndogs, especially the open-faced bulldog.",
        "But he had a queer experience years ago, in St. Jo, Missouri. He had been\ncity editor of the Kansas City Journal for some time, but one evening,\nwhile in the composing-room, the foreman told him that the place for the\ncity editor was down stairs, in his office. He therefore ordered Visscher\nto go down there. Visscher said he would do so later on, after he got\nfatigued with the composing-room and wanted change of scene.",
        "The foreman thereupon jumped on Mr. Visscher with a small pica wrought\niron side stick. Visscher allowed that he was a peaceable man, but entered\ninto the general chaos of double-leaded editorial, and hair and brass\ndashes, and dashes for liberty and heterogeneous “pi,” and foot-sticks and\nteeth, with great zeal. He succeeded in putting a large doric head on the\nforeman, and although he was a peaceable man, he went down to the office\nand got his discharge for disturbing the discipline of the office.",
        "He went to St. Jo the same day, and celebrated his debut into the town\nby a little game of what is known as “draw.” He was fortunate in “filling\nhis hand,” and while he was taking in the stakes, a young man from\nArkansas, who was in the game, nipped a two-dollar note in a quiet kind of\nway, which, however, was detected by Mr. V., who mentioned the matter at\nthe time. This maddened the Arkansas man, and later on he put one of his\nlong arms around Mr. Visscher so as to pinion him, and then smote him\nacross the brow with an instrument, known to science as “the brass\nknucks.” This irritated Mr. Visscher, and as soon as he had returned to\nconsciousness he remarked that, although it was rather an up-hill job in\nMissouri, he was trying to be a peaceable man. He then broke the leg of a\ncard-table over the head of the Arkansas man, and went to the doctor to\nget his own brow sewed on again.",
        "While he was sitting in the doctor’s office a friend of the Arkansas man\ncame in and asked him to please stand up while he knocked him down.\nVisscher opened a little dialogue with the man, and drew him into\nconversation till he could open a case of surgical instruments near by,\nthen he took out one of those knives that the surgeons use in removing the\nviscera from the leading gentleman at a post mortem.",
        "“Now,” said he, sharpening the knife on the stove-pipe and handing down a\njar containing alcohol with a tumor in it, “I am a peaceful man and don’t\nwant any fuss; but if you insist on a personal encounter, I will slice off\nfragments of your physiognomy at my leisure, and for twenty minutes I will\nfill this office with your favorite features. I make a specialty of being\na peaceable man, remember; but if you’ll just say the word, I’ll put\novercoat button-holes and eyelet-holes and crazy-quilts all over your\nsystem. If I’ve got to kill off the poker-players of St. Jo before I can\nhave any fun, I guess I might as well begin on you as on any one I know.”",
        "He then made a stab at the man and pinned his coat-tail to the door-frame.\nFear loaned the bad man strength, and, splitting the coat-tail, he fled,\ntaking little mementoes of the tumor-jar and shedding them in his flight.",
        "When Mr. Visscher went up to the Herald office soon after to get a job,\nhe was introduced casually to the foreman, who said:",
        "“Ah, this is the young man who licks the foreman of the paper he works on,\nis it? I am glad to meet you, Mr. Visscher. I am looking for a white-eyed\nson of a sea-cook who goes around over Missouri thumping the foremen of\nour leading journals. Come out into the ante-room, Mr. Visscher, till I\njar your back teeth loose and send you to the morgue in a gunny-sack.” Mr.\nVisscher repeated that he was trying to live in Missouri and be a\npeaceable man, but that if there was anything that he could do to make it\npleasant for the foreman, he would cheerfully do it.",
        "Mr. Visscher was a small man, but when he felt aggrieved about anything he\nwas very harassing to his adversary. They “clinched” and threw each other\nback and forth across the hall with great vigor. When they stopped for\nbreath, the foreman’s coat was pulled over his head and the bosom of Mr.\nVisscher’s shirt was hanging on the gas-jet. There were also two front\nteeth on the floor unaccounted for.",
        "Visscher pinned on his shirt-bosom and said he was a peaceable man, but if\nthe custom seemed to demand four fights in one day, he would try to\nconform to any local usage of the city. Wherever he went, he wanted to\nfall right into line and be one of the party.",
        "When he got well he was employed on the Herald, and for four years\nedited the amnesty column of the paper successfully.",
