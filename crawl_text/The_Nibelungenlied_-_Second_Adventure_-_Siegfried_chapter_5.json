        "There grew likewise in Netherland / a prince of noble kind,\nSiegmund hight his father, / his mother Siegelind–\nWithin a lordly castle / well known the country o’er,\nBy the Rhine far downward: / Xanten was the name it bore.",
        "21",
        "Siegfried they did call him, / this bold knight and good;\nMany a realm he tested, / for brave was he of mood.\nHe rode to prove his prowess / in many a land around:\nHeigh-ho! what thanes of mettle / anon in Burgundy he found!",
        "22",
        "In the springtime of his vigor, / when he was young and bold,\nCould tales of mickle wonder / of Siegfried be told,\nHow he grew up in honor, / and how fair he was to see:\nAnon he won the favor / of many a debonair lady.",
        "23",
        "As for a prince was fitting, / they fostered him with care:\nYet how the knightly virtues / to him native were!\n’Twas soon the chiefest glory / of his father’s land,\nThat he in fullest measure / endowed with princely worth did stand.",
        "24",
        "He soon was grown in stature / that he at court did ride.\nThe people saw him gladly, / lady and maid beside\nDid wish that his own liking / might lead him ever there.\nThat they did lean unto him / the knight was soon right well aware.",
        "25",
        "In youth they let him never / without safe escort ride;\nSoon bade Siegmund and Siegelind / apparel rich provide;\nMen ripe in wisdom taught him, / who knew whence honor came.\nThus many lands and people / he won by his wide-honored name.",
        "26",
        "Now was he of such stature / that he could weapons bear:\nOf what thereto he needed / had he an ample share.\nThen to think of loving / fair maids did he begin,\nAnd well might they be honored / for wooer Siegfried bold to win.",
        "27",
        "Then bade his father Siegmund / make known to one and all\nThat he with his good kinsmen / would hold high festival.\nAnd soon were tidings carried / to all the neighboring kings;\nTo friends at home and strangers / steeds gave he and rich furnishings.",
        "28",
        "Wherever they found any / who knight was fit to be\nBy reason of his kindred, / all such were courteously\nUnto the land invited / to join the festal throng,\nWhen with the prince so youthful / on them the knightly sword was hung.",
        "29",
        "Of this high time of revelry / might I great wonders tell.\nSiegmund and Siegelind / great honor won full well,\nSuch store of goodly presents / they dealt with generous hand,\nThat knights were seen full many / from far come pricking to their land.",
        "30",
        "Four hundred lusty squires / were there to be clad\nIn knight’s full garb with Siegfried. / Full many a beauteous maid\nAt work did never tire, / for dear they did him hold,\nAnd many a stone full precious / those ladies laid within the gold,",
        "31",
        "That they upon the doublets / embroidered cunningly\nOf those soon to be knighted: / ’t was thus it had to be,\nSeats bade the host for many / a warrior bold make right\nAgainst the high midsummer, / when Siegfried won the name of knight.",
        "32",
        "Then went unto the minster / full many a noble knight\nAnd gallant squires beside them. / The elder there with right\nDid wait upon the younger, / as once for them was done.\nThey were all light-hearted, / in hope of pleasure every one.",
        "33",
        "God to praise and honor / they sang the mass’ song;\nThere, too, were crowds of people, / a great and surging throng,\nWhen after knightly custom / knighthood received they then,\nIn such a stately pageant / as scarce might ever be again.",
        "34",
        "They hastened where they found them / saddled many a steed;\nIn the court of Siegmund’s castle / they tilted with such speed\nThat far the din resounded / through castle and through hall,\nAs in the play with clamor / did join the fiery riders all.",
        "35",
        "Well-tried old knights and youthful / met there in frequent clash,\nThere was sound of shattered lances / that through the air did crash,\nAnd along before the castle / were splinters seen to fly\nFrom hands of knights a many: / each with other there did vie.",
        "36",
        "The king he bade give over: / they led the chargers out:\nThere was seen all shattered / many a boss well-wrought,\nAnd many a stone full costly / lay there upon the sward\nFrom erstwhile shining shield-bands, / now broken in the jousting hard.",
        "37",
        "The guests all went thereafter / where seats for them were reared;\nThey by the choicest viands / from weariness were cheered,\nAnd wine, of all the rarest, / that then in plenty flowed.\nUpon both friends and strangers / were fitting honors rich bestowed.",
        "38",
        "In such merry manner / all day did last the feast.\nMany a wandering minstrel / knew not any rest,\nBut sang to win the presents / dealt out with bounteous hand;\nAnd with their praise was honored / far and wide King Siegmund’s land.",
        "39",
        "The monarch then did order / Siegfried his youthful son\nIn fee give lands and castles, / as he erstwhile had done.\nTo all his sword-companions / he gave with such full hand,\nThat joyed they o’er the journey / they now had made unto that land.",
        "40",
        "The festival yet lasted / until the seventh day.\nSiegelind after old custom / in plenty gave away\n–For so her son she honored– / rich gifts of shining gold:\nIn sooth deserved she richly / that all should him in honor hold.",
        "41",
        "Never a wandering minstrel / was unprovided found:\nHorses there and raiment / so free were dealt around,\nAs if to live they had not / beyond it one day more.\nI ween a monarch’s household / ne’er bestowed such gifts before.",
        "42",
        "Thus closed the merry feasting / in this right worthy way,\nAnd ’t was well known thereafter / how those good knights did say\nThat they the youthful hero / for king would gladly have;\nBut this nowise he wished for, / Siegfried the stately knight and brave.",
        "43",
        "While that they both were living, / Siegmund and Siegelind,\nNo crown their son desired, / –thereto he had no mind.\nYet would he fain be master / o’er all the hostile might\nThat in the lands around him / opposed the keen and fiery knight.",
