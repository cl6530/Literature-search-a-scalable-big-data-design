        "Personal.–Will the young woman who used to cook in our family, and who\nwent away ten pounds of sugar and five and a half pounds of tea ahead of\nthe game, please come back, and all will be forgiven.",
        "If she cannot return, will she please write, stating her present address,\nand also give her reasons for shutting up the cat in the refrigerator when\nshe went away?",
        "If she will only return, we will try to forget the past, and think only of\nthe glorious present and the bright, bright future.",
        "Come back, Sarah, and jerk the waffle-iron for us once more.",
        "Your manners are peculiar, but we yearn for your doughnuts, and your style\nof streaked cake suits us exactly.",
        "You may keep the handkerchiefs and the collars, and we will not refer to\nthe dead past.",
        "We have arranged it so that when you snore it will not disturb the night\npolice, and if you do not like our children we will send them away.",
        "We realize that you do not like children very well, and our children\nespecially gave you much pain, because they were not so refined as you\nwere.",
        "We have often wished, for your sake, that we had never had any children;\nbut so long as they are in our family, the neighbors will rather expect us\nto take care of them.",
        "Still, if you insist upon it, we will send them away. We don’t want to\nseem overbearing with our servants.",
        "We would be willing, also, to give you more time for mental relaxation\nthan you had before. The intellectual strain incident to the life of one\nwho makes gravy for a lost and undone world must be very great, and tired\nnature must at last succumb. We do not want you to succumb. If anyone has\ngot to succumb, let us do it.",
        "All we ask is that you will let us know when you are going away, and leave\nthe crackers and cheese where we can find them.",
        "It was rather rough on us to have you go away when we had guests in the\nhouse, but if you had not taken the key to the cooking department we could\nhave worried along.",
        "You ought to let us have company at the house sometimes if we will let you\nhave company when you want to. Still, you know best, perhaps. You are\nolder than we are, and you have seen more of the world.",
        "We miss your gentle admonitions and your stern reproofs sadly. Come back\nand reprove us again. Come back and admonish us once more, at so much per\nadmonish and groceries.",
        "We will agree to let you select the tender part of the steak, and such\nfruit as seems to strike you favorably, just as we did before. We did not\nlike it when you were here, but that is because we were young and did not\nknow what the custom was.",
        "If a life-time devoted to your welfare can obliterate the injustice we\nhave done you, we will be glad to yield it to you.",
        "If you could suggest a good place for us to send the children, where they\nwould be well taken care of, and where they would not interfere with some\nother cook who is a friend of yours, we would be glad to have you write\nus.",
        "My wife says she hopes you will feel perfectly free to use the piano\nwhenever you are lonely or sad, and when you or the bread feel depressed\nyou will be welcome to come into the parlor and lean up against either one\nof us and sob.",
        "We all know that when you were with us before we were a little reserved in\nour manner toward you, but if you come back it will be different.",
        "We will introduce you to more of our friends this time, and we hope you\nwill do the same by us. Young people are apt to get above their business,\nand we admit that we were wrong.",
        "Come back and oversee our fritter bureau once more.",
        "Take the portfolio of our interior department.",
        "Try to forget our former coldness.",
        "Return, oh, wanderer, return!",
