        "“I hear there is a letter for me, Mr. Brown,” said Ben to the\npostmaster, who was folding the evening papers, of which he received a\nparcel from the city by the afternoon train.",
        "“Yes, Ben,” answered the postmaster, smiling.  “It appears to be from\na lady in New York.  You must have improved your time during your\nrecent visit to the city.”",
        "“I made the acquaintance of one lady older than my mother,” answered\nBen.  “I didn’t flirt with her any.”",
        "“At any rate, I should judge that she became interested in you or she\nwouldn’t write.”",
        "“I hope she did, for she is very wealthy,” returned Ben.",
        "The letter was placed in his hands, and he quickly tore it open.",
        "Something dropped from it.",
        "“What is that?” asked the postmaster.",
        "Ben stooped and picked it up, and, to his surprise, discovered that it\nwas a ten-dollar bill.",
        "“That’s a correspondent worth having,” said Mr. Brown jocosely.\n“Can’t you give me a letter of introduction?”",
        "Ben didn’t answer, for he was by this time deep the letter.  We will\nlook over his shoulder and read it with him.  It ran thus:",
        "                             “No. –– Madison Avenue,\n                                   New York, October 5.",
        "  “My Dear Young Friend:",
        "  “Will you come to New York and call upon me?  I have a very pleasant\n  remembrance of you and the service you did me recently, and think I\n  can employ you in other ways, to our mutual advantage.  I am willing\n  to pay you a higher salary than you are receiving in your country\n  home, besides providing you with a home in my own house.  I inclose\n  ten dollars for expenses.  Yours, with best wishes,",
        "                             “Helen Hamilton”",
        "Ben’s heart beat with joyful excitement as he read this letter.  It\ncould not have come at a better time, for, as we know, he was out of\nemployment, and, of course, earning nothing.",
        "“Well, Ben,” said the postmaster, whose curiosity was excited, is it\ngood news?”",
        "“I should say it was,” said Ben emphatically.  “I am offered a good\nsituation in New York.”",
        "“You don’t say so!  How much are offered?”",
        "“I am to get more than Mr. Crawford paid me and board in a fine house\nbesides–a brownstone house on Madison Avenue.”",
        "“Well, I declare!  You are in luck,” ejaculated Mr. Brown.  “What are\nyou to do?”",
        "“That’s more than I know.  Here is the letter, if you like to read\nit.”",
        "“It reads well.  She must be a generous lady.  But what will your\nmother say?”",
        "“That’s what I want to know,” said Ben, looking suddenly sober.  “I\nhate to leave her, but it is for my good.”",
        "“Mothers are self-sacrificing when the interests of their children are\nconcerned.”",
        "“I know that,” said Ben promptly; “and I’ve got one of the best\nmothers going.”",
        "“So you have.  Every one likes and respects Mrs. Barclay.”",
        "Any boy, who is worth anything, likes to hear his mother praised, and\nBen liked Mr. Brown better for this tribute to the one whom he loved\nbest on earth.  He was not slow in making his way home.  He went at\nonce to the kitchen, where his mother was engaged in mixing bread.",
        "“What’s the matter, Ben?  You look excited,” said Mrs. Barkley.",
        "“So I am, mother.  I am offered a position.”",
        "“Not in the store?”",
        "“No; it is in New York.”",
        "“In New York!” repeated his mother, in a troubled voice.  “It would\ncost you all you could make to pay your board in some cheap boarding\nhouse.  If it were really going to be for your own good, I might\nconsent to part with you, but–”",
        "“Read that letter, mother,” said Ben.  “You will see that I shall have\nan elegant home and a salary besides.  It is a chance in a thousand.”",
        "Mrs. Barclay read the letter carefully.",
        "“Can I go, mother?” Ben asked anxiously.",
        "“It will be a sacrifice for me to part with you,” returned his mother\nslowly; “but I agree with you that it is a rare chance, and I should\nbe doing wrong to stand in the way of your good fortune.  Mrs.\nHamilton must have formed a very good opinion of you.”",
        "“She may be disappointed in me,” said Ben modestly.",
        "“I don’t think she will,” said Mrs. Barclay, with a proud and\naffectionate glance at her boy.  “You have always been a good son, and\nthat is the best of recommendations.”",
        "“I am afraid you are too partial, mother.  I shall hate to leave you\nalone.”",
        "“I can bear loneliness if I know you are prospering, Ben.”",
        "“And it will only be for a time, mother.  When I am a young man and\nearning a good income, I shall want you to come and live with me.”",
        "“All in good time, Ben.  How soon do you want to go?”",
        "“I think it better to lose no time, mother.  You know I have no work\nto keep me in Pentonville.”",
        "“But it will take two or three days to get your clothes ready.”",
        "“You can send them to me by express.  I shall send you the address.”",
        "Mrs. Barclay was a fond mother, but she was also a sensible woman.\nShe felt that Ben was right, and, though it seemed very sudden, she\ngave him her permission to start the next morning.  Had she objected\nstrenuously, Ben would have given up his plan, much as he desired it,\nfor he felt that his mother had the strongest claims upon him, and he\nwould not have been willing to run counter to her wishes.",
        "“Where are you going, Ben?” asked his mother, as Ben put on his hat\nand moved toward the door.",
        "“I thought I would like to call on Rose Gardiner to say good-by,\"\nanswered Ben.",
        "“Quite right, my son.  Rose is a good friend of yours, and an\nexcellent girl”",
        "“I say ditto to that, mother,” Ben answered warmly.",
        "I am not going to represent Ben as being in love–he was too young for\nthat–but, like many boys of his age, he felt a special attraction in\nthe society of one young girl.  His good taste was certainly not at\nfault in his choice of Rose Gardiner, who, far from being frivolous\nand fashionable, was a girl of sterling traits, who was not above\nmaking herself useful in the household of which she formed a part.",
        "On his way to the home of Rose Gardiner, Ben met Tom Davenport.",
        "“How are you getting along?” asked Tom, not out of interest, but\ncuriosity.",
        "“Very well, thank you.”",
        "“Have you got through helping the farmer?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“It was a very long job.  Have you thought better of coming to saw\nwood for father?”",
        "“No; I have thought worse of it,” answered Ben, smiling.",
        "“You are too proud.  Poor and proud don’t agree.”",
        "“Not at all.  I would have had no objection to the work.  It was the\npay I didn’t like.”",
        "“You can’t earn more than forty cents a day at anything else.”",
        "“You are mistaken.  I am going to New York to-morrow to take a place,\nwhere I get board and considerable more money besides.”",
        "“Is that true?” asked Tom, looking as if he had lost his best friend.",
        "“Quite so.  The party inclosed ten dollars to pay my expenses up to\nthe city.”",
        "“He must be a fool.”",
        "“Thank you.  It happens to be a lady.”",
        "“What are you to do?”",
        "“I don’t know yet.  I am sure I shall be well paid.  I must ask you to\nexcuse me now, as I am going to call on Rose Gardiner to bid her\ngood-by.”",
        "“I dare say she would excuse you,” said Tom, with a sneer.",
        "“Perhaps so; but I wouldn’t like to go without saying good-by.”",
        "“At any rate, he will be out of my way,” thought Tom, “and I can\nmonopolize Rose.  I’m glad he’s going.”",
        "He bade Ben an unusually civil good-night at this thought occurred to\nhim.",
