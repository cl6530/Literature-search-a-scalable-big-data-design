        "  The tongue of the village old dame finds as free vent as a river that\n      has broken its banks.\n  The affectionate cousin makes up his mind to sift to the very bottom\n      the story told by old goody Liu.",
        "Upon seeing, the story explains, P’ing Erh arrive, they unanimously\ninquired, “What is your mistress up to? How is it she hasn’t come?”",
        "“How ever could she spare the time to get as far as here?” P’ing Erh\nsmiled and replied. “But, she said, she hasn’t anything good to eat, so\nshe bade me, as she couldn’t possibly run over, come and find out\nwhether there be any more crabs or not; (if there be), she enjoined me\nto ask for a few to take to her to eat at home.”",
        "“There are plenty!” Hsiang-yün rejoined; and directing, with alacrity, a\nservant to fetch a present box, she put in it ten of the largest crabs.",
        "“I’ll take a few more of the female ones,” P’ing Erh remarked.",
        "One and all then laid hands upon P’ing Erh and tried to drag her into a\nseat, but P’ing Erh would not accede to their importunities.",
        "“I insist upon your sitting down,” Li Wan laughingly exclaimed, and as\nshe kept pulling her about, and forcing her to sit next to her, she\nfilled a cup of wine and put it to her lips. P’ing Erh hastily swallowed\na sip and endeavoured immediately to beat a retreat.",
        "“I won’t let you go,” shouted Li Wan. “It’s so evident that you’re only\ngot that woman Feng in your thoughts as you don’t listen to any of my\nwords!”",
        "Saying this, she went on to bid the nurses go ahead, and take the box\nover. “Tell her,” she added, “that I’ve kept P’ing Erh here.”",
        "A matron presently returned with a box. “Lady Secunda,” she reported,\n“says that you, lady Chu, and our young mistresses must not make fun of\nher for having asked for something to eat; and that in this box you’ll\nfind cakes made of water-lily powder, and rolls prepared with chicken\nfat, which your maternal aunt, on the other side, just sent for your\nladyship and for you, young ladies, to taste. That she bids you,” (the\nmatron) continued, turning towards P’ing Erh, “come over on duty, but\nyour mind is so set upon pleasure that you loiter behind and don’t go\nback. She advises you, however, not to have too many cups of wine.”",
        "“Were I even to have too much,” P’ing Erh smiled, “what could she do to\nme?”",
        "Uttering these words, she went on with her drink; after which she\npartook of some more crab.",
        "“What a pity it is,” interposed Li Wan, caressing her, “that a girl with\nsuch good looks as you should have so ordinary a fortune as to simply\nfall into that room as a menial! But wouldn’t any one, who is not\nacquainted with actual facts, take you for a lady and a mistress?”",
        "While she went on eating and drinking with Pao-ch’ai, Hsiang-yün and the\nother girls, P’ing Erh turned her head round. “Don’t rub me like that!\"\nshe laughed, “It makes me feel quite ticklish.”",
        "“Ai-yo!” shouted Li Wan. “What’s this hard thing?”",
        "“It’s a key,” P’ing Erh answered.",
        "“What fine things have you got that the fear lest people should take it\naway, prompts you to carry this about you? I keep on, just for a laugh,\ntelling people the whole day long that when the bonze T’ang was fetching\nthe canons, a white horse came and carried him! That when Liu Chih-yüan\nwas attacking the empire, a melon-spirit appeared and brought him a coat\nof mail, and that in the same way, where our vixen Feng is, there you\nare to be found! You are your mistress’ general key; and what do you\nwant this other key for?”",
        "“You’ve primed yourself with wine, my lady,” P’ing Erh smiled, “and here\nyou once more chaff me and make a laughing-stock of me.”",
        "“This is really quite true,” Pao-ch’ai laughed. “Whenever we’ve got\nnothing to do, and we talk matters over, (we’re quite unanimous) that\nnot one in a hundred could be picked out to equal you girls in here. The\nbeauty is that each one of you possesses her own good qualities!”",
        "“In every thing, whether large or small, a heavenly principle rules\nalike,” Li Wan explained. “Were there, for instance, no Yüan Yang in our\nvenerable senior’s apartments, how would it ever do? Commencing with\nMadame Wang herself, who is it who could muster sufficient courage to\nexpostulate with the old lady? Yet she plainly has the pluck to put in\nher remonstrances with her; and, as it happens, our worthy ancestor\nlends a patient ear to only what she says and no one else. None of the\nothers can remember what our old senior has in the way of clothes and\nhead-ornaments, but she can remember everything; and, were she not there\nto look after things, there is no knowing how many would not be swindled\naway. That child besides is so straightforward at heart, that, despite\nall this, she often puts in a good word for others, and doesn’t rely\nupon her influence to look down disdainfully upon any one!”",
        "“It was only yesterday,” Hsi Ch’un observed with a smile, “that our dear\nancestor said that she was ever so much better than the whole lot of\nus!”",
        "“She’s certainly splendid!” P’ing Erh ventured. “How could we rise up to\nher standard?”",
        "“Ts’ai Hsia,” Pao-yü put in, “who is in mother’s rooms, is a good sort\nof girl!”",
        "“Of course she is!” T’an Ch’un assented. “But she’s good enough as far\nas external appearances go, but inwardly she’s a sly one! Madame Wang is\njust like a joss; she does not give her mind to any sort of business;\nbut this girl is up to everything; and it is she who in all manner of\nthings reminds her mistress what there is to be done. She even knows\neverything, whether large or small, connected with Mr. Chia Cheng’s\nstaying at home or going out of doors; and when at any time Madame Wang\nforgets, she, from behind the scenes, prompts her how to act.”",
        "“Well, never mind about her!” Li Wan suggested. “But were,” she pursued,\npointing at Pao-yü, “no Hsi Jen in this young gentleman’s quarters, just\nyou imagine what a pitch things would reach! That vixen Feng may truly\nresemble the prince Pa of the Ch’u kingdom; and she may have two arms\nstrong enough to raise a tripod weighing a thousand catties, but had she\nnot this maid (P’ing Erh), would she be able to accomplish everything so\nthoroughly?”",
        "“In days gone by,” P’ing Erh interposed, “four servant-girls came along\nwith her, but what with those who’ve died and those who’ve gone, only I\nremain like a solitary spirit.”",
        "“You’re, after all, the fortunate one!” Li Wan retorted, “but our hussey\nFeng too is lucky in having you! Had I not also once, just remember, two\ngirls, when your senior master Chu was alive? Am I not, you’ve seen for\nyourselves, a person to bear with people? But in such a surly frame of\nmind did I find them both day after day that, as soon as your senior\nmaster departed this life, I availed myself of their youth (to give them\nin marriage) and to pack both of them out of my place. But had either of\nthem been good for anything and worthy to be kept, I would, in fact,\nhave now had some one to give me a helping hand!”",
        "As she spoke, the very balls of her eyes suddenly became quite red.",
        "“Why need you again distress your mind?” they with one voice, exclaimed.\n“Isn’t it better that we should break up?”",
        "While conversing, they rinsed their hands; and, when they had agreed to\ngo in a company to dowager lady Chia’s and Madame Wang’s and inquire\nafter their health, the matrons and servant-maids swept the pavilion and\ncollected and washed the cups and saucers.",
        "Hsi Jen proceeded on her way along with P’ing Erh. “Come into my room,\"\nsaid Hsi Jen to P’ing Erh, “and sit down and have another cup of tea.”",
        "“I won’t have any tea just now,” P’ing Erh answered. “I’ll come some\nother time.”",
        "So saying, she was about to go off when Hsi Jen called out to her and\nstopped her.",
        "“This month’s allowances,” she asked, “haven’t yet been issued, not even\nto our old mistress and Madame Wang; why is it?”",
        "Upon catching this inquiry, P’ing Erh hastily retraced her steps and\ndrew near Hsi Jen. After looking about to see that no one was in the\nneighbourhood, she rejoined in a low tone of voice, “Drop these\nquestions at once! They’re sure, anyhow, to be issued in a couple of\ndays.”",
        "“Why is it,” smiled Hsi Jen, “that this gives you such a start?”",
        "“This month’s allowances,” P’ing Erh explained to her in a whisper,\n“have long ago been obtained in advance by our mistress Secunda and\ngiven to people for their own purposes; and it’s when the interest has\nbeen brought from here and there that the various sums will be lumped\ntogether and payment be effected. I confide this to you, but, mind, you\nmustn’t go and tell any other person about it.”",
        "“Is it likely that she hasn’t yet enough money for her own\nrequirements?” Hsi Jen smiled. “Or is it that she’s still not satisfied?\nAnd what’s the use of her still going on bothering herself in this way?”",
        "“Isn’t it so!” laughed P’ing Erh. “From just handling the funds for this\nparticular item, she has, during these few years, so manipulated them as\nto turn up several hundreds of taels profit out of them. Nor does she\nspend that monthly allowance of hers for public expenses. But the moment\nshe accumulates anything like eight or ten taels odd, she gives them out\ntoo. Thus the interest on her own money alone comes up to nearly a\nthousand taels a year.”",
        "“You and your mistress take our money,” Hsi Jen observed laughingly,\n“and get interest on it; fooling us as if we were no better than\nidiots.”",
        "“Here you are again with your uncharitable words!” P’ing Erh\nremonstrated. “Can it be that you haven’t yet enough to meet your own\nexpenses with?”",
        "“I am, it’s true, not short of money,” Hsi Jen replied, “as I have\nnowhere to go and spend it; but the thing is that I’m making provision\nfor that fellow of ours, (Pao-yü).”",
        "“If you ever find yourself in any great straits and need money,” P’ing\nErh resumed, “you’re at liberty to take first those few taels I’ve got\nover there to suit your own convenience with, and by and bye I can\nreduce them from what is due to you and we’ll be square.”",
        "“I’m not in need of any just now,” retorted Hsi Jen. “But should I not\nhave enough, when I want some, I’ll send some one to fetch them, and\nfinish.”",
        "P’ing Erh promised that she would let her have the money at any time she\nsent for it, and, and taking the shortest cut, she issued out of the\ngarden gate. Here she encountered a servant despatched from the other\nside by lady Feng. She came in search of P’ing Erh. “Our lady,” she\nsaid, “has something for you to do, and is waiting for you.”",
        "“What’s up that it’s so pressing?” P’ing Erh inquired. “Our senior\nmistress detained me by force to have a chat, so I couldn’t manage to\nget away. But here she time after time sends people after me in this\nmanner!”",
        "“Whether you go or not is your own look out,” the maid replied. “It\nisn’t worth your while getting angry with me! If you dare, go and tell\nthese things to our mistress!”",
        "P’ing Erh spat at her contemptuously, and rushed back in anxious haste.\nShe discovered, however, that lady Feng was not at home. But\nunexpectedly she perceived that the old goody Liu, who had paid them a\nvisit on a previous occasion for the purpose of obtaining pecuniary\nassistance, had come again with Pan Erh, and was seated in the opposite\nroom, along with Chang Ts’ai’s wife and Chou Jui’s wife, who kept her\ncompany. But two or three servant-maids were inside as well emptying on\nthe floor bags containing dates, squash and various wild greens.",
        "As soon as they saw her appear in the room, they promptly stood up in a\nbody. Old goody Liu had, on her last visit, learnt what P’ing Erh’s\nstatus in the establishment was, so vehemently jumping down, she\nenquired, “Miss, how do you do? All at home,” she pursued, “send you\ntheir compliments. I meant to have come earlier and paid my respects to\nmy lady and to look you up, miss; but we’ve been very busy on the farm.\nWe managed this year to reap, after great labour, a few more piculs of\ngrain than usual. But melons, fruits and vegetables have also been\nplentiful. These things, you see here, are what we picked during the\nfirst crop; and as we didn’t presume to sell them, we kept the best to\npresent to our lady and the young ladies to taste. The young ladies\nmust, of course, be surfeited with all the delicacies and fine things\nthey daily get, but by having some of our wild greens to eat, they will\nshow some regard for our poor attention.”",
        "“Many thanks for all the trouble you have taken!” Ping Erh eagerly\nrejoined. Then pressing her to resume her place, she sat down herself;\nand, urging Mrs. Chang and Mrs. Chou to take their seats, she bade a\nyoung waiting-maid go and serve the tea.",
        "“There’s a joyous air about your face to-day, Miss, and your eye-balls\nare all red,” the wife of Chou Jui and the wife of Chang Ts’ai thereupon\nsmilingly ventured.",
        "“Naturally!” P’ing Erh laughed. “I generally don’t take any wine, but\nour senior mistress, and our young ladies caught hold of me and insisted\nupon pouring it down my throat. I had no alternative therefore but to\nswallow two cups full; so my face at once flushed crimson.”",
        "“I have a longing for wine,” Chang Ts’ai’s wife smiled; “but there’s no\none to offer me any. But when any one by and by invites you, Miss, do\ntake me along with you!”",
        "At these words, one and all burst out laughing.",
        "“Early this morning,” Chou Jui’s wife interposed, “I caught a glimpse of\nthose crabs. Only two or three of them would weigh a catty; so in those\ntwo or three huge hampers, there must have been, I presume, seventy to\neighty catties!”",
        "“If some were intended for those above as well as for those below;” Chou\nJui’s wife added, “they couldn’t, nevertheless, I fear, have been\nenough.”",
        "“How could every one have had any?” P’ing Erh observed. “Those simply\nwith any name may have tasted a couple of them; but, as for the rest,\nsome may have touched them with the tips of their hands, but many may\neven not have done as much.”",
        "“Crabs of this kind!” put in old goody Liu, “cost this year five\ncandareens a catty; ten catties for five mace; five times five make two\ntaels five, and three times five make fifteen; and adding what was\nwanted for wines and eatables, the total must have come to something\nover twenty taels. O-mi-to-fu! why, this heap of money is ample for us\ncountry-people to live on through a whole year!”",
        "“I expect you have seen our lady?” P’ing Erh then asked.",
        "“Yes, I have seen her,” assented old goody Liu. “She bade us wait.” As\nshe spoke, she again looked out of the window to see what the time of\nthe day could be. “It’s getting quite late,” she afterwards proceeded.\n“We must be going, or else we mayn’t be in time to get out of the city\ngates; and then we’ll be in a nice fix.”",
        "“Quite right,” Chou Jui’s wife observed. “I’ll go and see what she’s up\nto for you.”",
        "With these words, she straightway left the room. After a long absence,\nshe returned. “Good fortune has, indeed, descended upon you, old dame!\"\nshe smiled. “Why, you’ve won the consideration of those two ladies!”",
        "“What about it?” laughingly inquired P’ing Erh and the others.",
        "“Lady Secunda,” Chou Jui’s wife explained with a smile, “was with our\nvenerable lady, so I gently whispered to her: ’old goody Liu wishes to\ngo home; it’s getting late and she fears she mightn’t be in time to go\nout of the gates!’ ’It’s such a long way off!’ Our lady Secunda\nrejoined, ’and she had all the trouble and fatigue of carrying that load\nof things; so if it’s too late, why, let her spend the night here and\nstart on the morrow!’ Now isn’t this having enlisted our mistress’\nsympathies? But not to speak of this! Our old lady also happened to\noverhear what we said, and she inquired: ’who is old goody Liu?’ Our\nlady Secunda forthwith told her all. ’I was just longing,’ her venerable\nladyship pursued, ’for some one well up in years to have a chat with;\nask her in, and let me see her!’ So isn’t this coming in for\nconsideration, when least unexpected?”",
        "So speaking, she went on to urge old goody Liu to get down and betake\nherself to the front.",
        "“With a figure like this of mine,” old goody Liu demurred, “how could I\nvery well appear before her? My dear sister-in-law, do tell her that\nI’ve gone!”",
        "“Get on! Be quick!” P’ing Erh speedily cried. “What does it matter? Our\nold lady has the highest regard for old people and the greatest pity for\nthe needy! She’s not one you could compare with those haughty and\noverbearing people! But I fancy you’re a little too timid, so I’ll\naccompany you as far as there, along with Mrs. Chou.”",
        "While tendering her services, she and Chou Jui’s wife led off old goody\nLiu and crossed over to dowager lady Chia’s apartments on this side of\nthe mansion. The boy-servants on duty at the second gate stood up when\nthey saw P’ing Erh approach. But two of them also ran up to her, and,\nkeeping close to her heels: “Miss!” they shouted out. “Miss!”",
        "“What have you again got to say?” P’ing Erh asked.",
        "“It’s pretty late just now,” one of the boys smilingly remarked; “and\nmother is ill and wants me to go and call the doctor, so I would, dear\nMiss, like to have half a day’s leave; may I?”",
        "“Your doings are really fine!” P’ing Erh exclaimed. “You’ve agreed among\nyourselves that each day one of you should apply for furlough; but\ninstead of speaking to your lady, you come and bother me! The other day\nthat Chu Erh went, Mr. Secundus happened not to want him, so I assented,\nthough I also added that I was doing it as a favour; but here you too\ncome to-day!”",
        "“It’s quite true that his mother is sick,” Chou Jui’s wife interceded;\n“so, Miss, do say yes to him also, and let him go!”",
        "“Be back as soon as it dawns to-morrow!” P’ing Erh enjoined. “Wait, I’ve\ngot something for you to do, for you’ll again sleep away, and only turn\nup after the sun has blazed away on your buttocks. As you go now, give a\nmessage to Wang Erh! Tell him that our lady bade you warn him that if he\ndoes not hand over the balance of the interest due by to-morrow, she\nwon’t have anything to do with him. So he’d better let her have it to\nmeet her requirements and finish.”",
        "The servant-lad felt in high glee and exuberant spirits. Expressing his\nobedience, he walked off.",
        "P’ing Erh and her companions repaired then to old lady Chia’s\napartments. Here the various young ladies from the Garden of Broad Vista\nwere at the time assembled paying their respects to their grandmother.\nAs soon as old goody Liu put her foot inside, she saw the room thronged\nwith girls (as seductive) as twigs of flowers waving to and fro, and so\nrichly dressed, as to look enveloped in pearls, and encircled with\nking-fisher ornaments. But she could not make out who they all were. Her\ngaze was, however, attracted by an old dame, reclining alone on a divan.\nBehind her sat a girl, a regular beauty, clothed in gauze, engaged in\npatting her legs. Lady Feng was on her feet in the act of cracking some\njoke.",
        "Old goody Liu readily concluded that it must be dowager lady Chia, so\npromptly pressing forward, she put on a forced smile and made several\ncurtseys. “My obeisance to you, star of longevity!” she said.",
        "Old lady Chia hastened, on her part, to bow and to inquire after her\nhealth. Then she asked Chou Jui’s wife to bring a chair over for her to\ntake a seat. But Pan Erh was still so very shy that he did not know how\nto make his obeisance.",
        "“Venerable relative,” dowager lady Chia asked, “how old are you this\nyear?”",
        "Old goody Liu immediately rose to her feet. “I’m seventy-five this\nyear,” she rejoined.",
        "“So old and yet so hardy!” Old lady Chia remarked, addressing herself to\nthe party. “Why she’s older than myself by several years! When I reach\nthat age, I wonder whether I shall be able to move!”",
        "“We people have,” old goody Liu smilingly resumed, “to put up, from the\nmoment we come into the world, with ever so many hardships; while your\nvenerable ladyship enjoys, from your birth, every kind of blessing! Were\nwe also like this, there’d be no one to carry on that farming work.”",
        "“Are your eyes and teeth still good?” Dowager lady Chia went on to\ninquire.",
        "“They’re both still all right,” old goody Liu replied. “The left molars,\nhowever, have got rather shaky this year.”",
        "“As for me, I’m quite an old fossil,” dowager lady Chia observed. “I’m\nno good whatever. My eyesight is dim; my ears are deaf, my memory is\ngone. I can’t even recollect any of you, old family connections. When\ntherefore any of our relations come on a visit, I don’t see them for\nfear lest I should be ridiculed. All I can manage to eat are a few\nmouthfuls of anything tender enough for my teeth; and I can just dose a\nbit or, when I feel in low spirits, I distract myself a little with\nthese grandsons and grand-daughters of mine; that’s all I’m good for.”",
        "“This is indeed your venerable ladyship’s good fortune!” old goody Liu\nsmiled. “We couldn’t enjoy anything of the kind, much though we may long\nfor it.”",
        "“What good fortune!” dowager lady Chia exclaimed. “I’m a useless old\nthing, no more.”",
        "This remark made every one explode into laughter.",
        "Dowager lady Chia also laughed. “I heard our lady Feng say a little\nwhile back,” she added, “that you had brought a lot of squash and\nvegetables, and I told her to put them by at once. I had just been\ncraving to have newly-grown melons and vegetables; but those one buys\noutside are not as luscious as those produced in your farms.”",
        "“This is the rustic notion,” old goody Liu laughed, “to entirely subsist\non fresh things! Yet, we long to have fish and meat for our fare, but we\ncan’t afford it.”",
        "“I’ve found a relative in you to-day,” dowager lady Chia said, “so you\nshouldn’t go empty-handed! If you don’t despise this place as too mean,\ndo stay a day or two before you start! We’ve also got a garden here; and\nthis garden produces fruits too; you can taste some of them to-morrow\nand take a few along with you home, in order to make it look like a\nvisit to relatives.”",
        "When lady Feng saw how delighted old lady Chia was with the prospects of\nthe old dame’s stay, she too lost no time in doing all she could to\ninduce her to remain. “Our place here,” she urged, “isn’t, it’s true, as\nspacious as your threshing-floor; but as we’ve got two vacant rooms,\nyou’d better put up in them for a couple of days, and choose some of\nyour village news and old stories and recount them to our worthy\nsenior.”",
        "“Now you, vixen Feng,” smiled dowager lady Chia, “don’t raise a laugh at\nher expense! She’s only a country woman; and will an old dame like her\nstand any chaff from you?”",
        "While remonstrating with her, she bade a servant go, before attending to\nanything else, and pluck a few fruits. These she handed to Pan Erh to\neat. But Pan Erh did not venture to touch them, conscious as he was of\nthe presence of such a number of bystanders. So old lady Chia gave\norders that a few cash should be given him, and then directed the pages\nto take him outside to play.",
        "After sipping a cup of tea, old goody Liu began to relate, for the\nbenefit of dowager lady Chia, a few of the occurrences she had seen or\nheard of in the country. These had the effect of putting old lady Chia\nin a more exuberant frame of mind. But in the midst of her narration, a\nservant, at lady Feng’s instance, asked goody Liu to go and have her\nevening meal. Dowager lady Chia then picked out, as well, several kinds\nof eatables from her own repast, and charged some one to take them to\ngoody Liu to feast on.",
        "But the consciousness that the old dame had taken her senior’s fancy\ninduced lady Feng to send her back again as soon as she had taken some\nrefreshments. On her arrival, Yüan Yang hastily deputed a matron to take\ngoody Liu to have a bath. She herself then went and selected two pieces\nof ordinary clothes, and these she entrusted to a servant to hand to the\nold dame to change. Goody Liu had hitherto not set eyes upon any such\ngrand things, so with eagerness she effected the necessary alterations\nin her costume. This over, she made her appearance outside, and, sitting\nin front of the divan occupied by dowager lady Chia, she went on to\nnarrate as many stories as she could recall to mind. Pao-yü and his\ncousins too were, at the time, assembled in the room, and as they had\nnever before heard anything the like of what she said, they, of course,\nthought her tales more full of zest than those related by itinerant\nblind story-tellers.",
        "Old goody Liu was, albeit a rustic person, gifted by nature with a good\ndeal of discrimination. She was besides advanced in years; and had gone\nthrough many experiences in her lifetime, so when she, in the first\nplace, saw how extremely delighted old lady Chia was with her, and, in\nthe second, how eager the whole crowd of young lads and lasses were to\nlisten to what fell from her mouth, she even invented, when she found\nher own stock exhausted, a good many yarns to recount to them.",
        "“What with all the sowing we have to do in our fields and the vegetables\nwe have to plant,” she consequently proceeded, “have we ever in our\nvillage any leisure to sit with lazy hands from year to year and day to\nday; no matter whether it’s spring, summer, autumn or winter, whether it\nblows or whether it rains? Yea, day after day all that we can do is to\nturn the bare road into a kind of pavilion to rest and cool ourselves\non! But what strange things don’t we see! Last winter, for instance,\nsnow fell for several consecutive days, and it piled up on the ground\nthree or four feet deep. One day, I got up early, but I hadn’t as yet\ngone out of the door of our house when I heard outside the noise of\nfirewood (being moved). I fancied that some one must have come to steal\nit, so I crept up to a hole in the window; but, lo, I discovered that it\nwas no one from our own village.”",
        "“It must have been,” interposed dowager lady Chia, “some wayfarers, who\nbeing smitten with the cold, took some of the firewood, they saw ready\nat hand, to go and make a fire and warm themselves with! That’s highly\nprobable!”",
        "“It was no wayfarers at all,” old goody Liu retorted smiling, “and\nthat’s what makes the story so strange. Who do you think it was,\nvenerable star of longevity? It was really a most handsome girl of\nseventeen or eighteen, whose hair was combed as smooth as if oil had\nbeen poured over it. She was dressed in a deep red jacket, a white silk\npetticoat....”",
        "When she reached this part of her narrative, suddenly became audible the\nvoices of people bawling outside. “It’s nothing much,” they shouted,\n“don’t frighten our old mistress!” Dowager lady Chia and the other\ninmates caught, however, their cries and hurriedly inquired what had\nhappened. A servant-maid explained in reply that a fire had broken out\nin the stables in the southern court, but that there was no danger, as\nthe flames had been suppressed.",
        "Their old grandmother was a person with very little nerve. The moment,\ntherefore, the report fell on her car, she jumped up with all despatch,\nand leaning on one of the family, she rushed on to the verandah to\nascertain the state of things. At the sight of the still brilliant\nlight, shed by the flames, on the south east part of the compound, old\nlady Chia was plunged in consternation, and invoking Buddha, she went on\nto shout to the servants to go and burn incense before the god of fire.",
        "Madame Wang and the rest of the members of the household lost no time in\ncrossing over in a body to see how she was getting on. “The fire has\nbeen already extinguished,” they too assured her, “please, dear\nancestor, repair into your rooms!”",
        "But it was only after old lady Chia had seen the light of the flames\nentirely subside that she at length led the whole company indoors. “What\nwas that girl up to, taking the firewood in that heavy fall of snow?\"\nPao-yü thereupon vehemently inquired of goody Liu. “What, if she had got\nfrostbitten and fallen ill?”",
        "“It was the reference made recently to the firewood that was being\nabstracted,” his grandmother Chia said, “that brought about this fire;\nand do you still go on asking more about it? Leave this story alone, and\ntell us something else!”",
        "Hearing this reminder, Pao-yü felt constrained to drop the subject, much\nagainst his wishes, and old goody Liu forthwith thought of something\nelse to tell them.",
        "“In our village,” she resumed, “and on the eastern side of our\nfarmstead, there lives an old dame, whose age is this year, over ninety.\nShe goes in daily for fasting, and worshipping Buddha. Who’d have\nthought it, she so moved the pity of the goddess of mercy that she gave\nher this message in a dream: ’It was at one time ordained that you\nshould have no posterity, but as you have proved so devout, I have now\nmemorialised the Pearly Emperor to grant you a grandson!’ The fact is,\nthis old dame had one son. This son had had too an only son; but he died\nafter they had with great difficulty managed to rear him to the age of\nseventeen or eighteen. And what tears didn’t they shed for him! But, in\ncourse of time, another son was actually born to him. He is this year\njust thirteen or fourteen, resembles a very ball of flower, (so plump is\nhe), and is clever and sharp to an exceptional degree! So this is indeed\na clear proof that those spirits and gods do exist!”",
        "This long tirade proved to be in harmony with dowager lady Chia’s and\nMadame Wang’s secret convictions on the subject. Even Madame Wang\ntherefore listened to every word with all profound attention. Pao-yü,\nhowever, was so pre-occupied with the story about the stolen firewood\nthat he fell in a brown study and gave way to conjectures.\n\r\n“Yesterday,” T’an Ch’un at this point remarked, “We put cousin Shih to a\nlot of trouble and inconvenience, so, when we get back, we must consult\nabout convening a meeting, and, while returning her entertainment, we\ncan also invite our venerable ancestor to come and admire the\nchrysanthemums; what do you think of this?”",
        "“Our worthy senior,” smiled Pao-yü, “has intimated that she means to\ngive a banquet to return cousin Shih’s hospitality, and to ask us to do\nthe honours. Let’s wait therefore until we partake of grandmother’s\ncollation, before we issue our own invitations; there will be ample time\nthen to do so.”",
        "“The later it gets, the cooler the weather becomes,” T’an Ch’un\nobserved, “and our dear senior is not likely to enjoy herself.”",
        "“Grandmother,” added Pao-yü, “is also fond of rain and snow, so wouldn’t\nit be as well to wait until the first fall, and then ask her to come and\nlook at the snow. This will be better, won’t it? And were we to recite\nour verses with snow about us, it will be ever so much more fun!”",
        "“To hum verses in the snow,” Lin Tai-yü speedily demurred with a smile,\n“won’t, in my idea, be half as nice as building up a heap of firewood\nand then stealing it, with the flakes playing about us. This will be by\nfar more enjoyable!”",
        "This proposal made Pao-ch’ai and the others laugh. Pao-yü cast a glance\nat her but made no reply.",
        "But, in a short time, the company broke up. Pao-yü eventually gave old\ngoody Liu a tug on the sly and plied her with minute questions as to who\nthe girl was. The old dame was placed under the necessity of fabricating\nsomething for his benefit. “The truth is,” she said, “that there stands\non the north bank of the ditch in our village a small ancestral hall, in\nwhich offerings are made, but not to spirits or gods. There was in\nformer days some official or other...”",
        "“While speaking, she went on to try and recollect his name and surname.",
        "“No matter about names or surnames!” Pao-yü expostulated. “There’s no\nneed for you to recall them to memory! Just mention the facts; they’ll\nbe enough.”",
        "“This official,” old goody Liu resumed, “had no son. His offspring\nconsisted of one young daughter, who went under the name of Jo Yü, (like\nJade). She could read and write, and was doated upon by this official\nand his consort, just as if she were a precious jewel. But,\nunfortunately, when this young lady, Jo Yü, grew up to be seventeen, she\ncontracted some disease and died.”",
        "When these words fell on Pao-yü’s ears, he stamped his foot and heaved a\nsigh. “What happened after that?” he then asked.",
        "Old goody Liu pursued her story.",
        "“So incessantly,” she continued, “did this official and his consort\nthink of their child that they raised this ancestral hall, erected a\nclay image of their young daughter Jo Yü in it, and appointed some one\nto burn incense and trim the fires. But so many days and years have now\nelapsed that the people themselves are no more alive, the temple is in\ndecay, and the image itself is become a spirit.”",
        "“It hasn’t become a spirit,” remonstrated Pao-yü with vehemence. “Human\nbeings of this kind may, the rule is, die, yet they are not dead.”",
        "“O-mi-to-fu!” ejaculated old goody Liu; “is it really so! Had you, sir,\nnot enlightened us, we would have remained under the impression that she\nhad become a spirit! But she repeatedly transforms herself into a human\nbeing, and there she roams about in every village, farmstead, inn and\nroadside. And the one I mentioned just now as having taken the firewood\nis that very girl! The villagers in our place are still consulting with\nthe idea of breaking this clay image and razing the temple to the\nground.”",
        "“Be quick and dissuade them!” eagerly exclaimed Pao-yü. “Were they to\nraze the temple to the ground, their crime won’t be small.”",
        "“It’s lucky that you told me, Sir,” old goody Liu added. “When I get\nback to-morrow, I’ll make them relinquish the idea and finish!”",
        "“Our venerable senior and my mother,” Pao-yü pursued, “are both\ncharitable persons. In fact, all the inmates of our family, whether old\nor young, do, in like manner, delight in good deeds, and take pleasure\nin distributing alms. Their greatest relish is to repair temples, and to\nput up images to the spirits; so to-morrow, I’ll make a subscription and\ncollect a few donations for you, and you can then act as incense-burner.\nWhen sufficient money has been raised, this fane can be repaired, and\nanother clay image put up; and month by month I’ll give you incense and\nfire money to enable you to burn joss-sticks; won’t this be A good thing\nfor you?”",
        "“In that case,” old goody Liu rejoined, “I shall, thanks to that young\nlady’s good fortune, have also a few cash to spend.”",
        "Pao-yü thereupon likewise wanted to know what the name of the place was,\nthe name of the village, how far it was there and back, and whereabout\nthe temple was situated.",
        "Old goody Liu replied to his questions, by telling him every idle\nthought that came first to her lips. Pao-yü, however, credited the\ninformation she gave him and, on his return to his rooms, he exercised,\nthe whole night, his mind with building castles in the air.",
        "On the morrow, as soon as daylight dawned, he speedily stepped out of\nhis room, and, handing Pei Ming several hundreds of cash, he bade him\nproceed first in the direction and to the place specified by old goody\nLiu, and clearly ascertain every detail, so as to enable him, on his\nreturn from his errand, to arrive at a suitable decision to carry out\nhis purpose. After Pei Ming’s departure, Pao-yü continued on pins on\nneedles and on the tiptoe of expectation. Into such a pitch of\nexcitement did he work himself, that he felt like an ant in a burning\npan. With suppressed impatience, he waited and waited until sunset. At\nlast then he perceived Pei Ming walk in, in high glee.",
        "“Have you discovered the place?” hastily inquired Pao-yü.",
        "“Master,” Pei Ming laughed, “you didn’t catch distinctly the directions\ngiven you, and you made me search in a nice way! The name of the place\nand the bearings can’t be those you gave me, Sir; that is why I’ve had\nto hunt about the whole day long! I prosecuted my inquiries up to the\nvery ditch on the north east side, before I eventually found a ruined\ntemple.”",
        "Upon hearing the result of his researches, Pao-yü was much gratified.\nHis very eyebrows distended. His eyes laughed. “Old goody Liu,” he said\nwith eagerness, “is a person well up in years, and she may at the moment\nhave remembered wrong; it’s very likely she did. But recount to me what\nyou saw.”",
        "“The door of that temple,” Pei Ming explained, “really faces south, and\nis all in a tumble-down condition. I searched and searched till I was\ndriven to utter despair. As soon, however, as I caught sight of it,\n’that’s right,’ I shouted, and promptly walked in. But I at once\ndiscovered a clay figure, which gave me such a fearful start, that I\nscampered out again; for it looked as much alive as if it were a real\nliving being.”",
        "Pao-yü smiled full of joy. “It can metamorphose itself into a human\nbeing,” he observed, “so, of course, it has more or less a life-like\nappearance.”",
        "“Was it ever a girl?” Pei Ming rejoined clapping his hands. “Why it was,\nin fact, no more than a green-faced and red-haired god of plagues.”",
        "Pao-yü, at this answer, spat at him contemptuously. “You are, in very\ntruth, a useless fool!” he cried. “Haven’t you even enough gumption for\nsuch a trifling job as this?”",
        "“What book, I wonder, have you again been reading, master?” Pei Ming\ncontinued. “Or you may, perhaps, have heard some one prattle a lot of\ntrash and believed it as true! You send me on this sort of wild goose\nchase and make me go and knock my head about, and how can you ever say\nthat I’m good for nothing?”",
        "Pao-yü did not fail to notice that he was in a state of exasperation so\nhe lost no time in trying to calm him. “Don’t be impatient!” he urged.\n“You can go again some other day, when you’ve got nothing to attend to,\nand institute further inquiries! If it turns out that she has\nhood-winked us, why, there will, naturally, be no such thing. But if,\nverily, there is, won’t you also lay up for yourself a store of good\ndeeds? I shall feel it my duty to reward you in a most handsome manner.”",
        "As he spoke, he espied a servant-lad, on service at the second gate,\napproach and report to him: “The young ladies in our venerable\nladyship’s apartments are standing at the threshold of the second gate\nand looking out for you, Mr. Secundus.”",
        "But as, reader, you are not aware what they were on the look-out to tell\nhim, the subsequent chapter will explain it for you.",
