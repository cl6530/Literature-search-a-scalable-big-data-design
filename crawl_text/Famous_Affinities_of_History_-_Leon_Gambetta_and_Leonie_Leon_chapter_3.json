        "The present French Republic has endured for over forty years.\nWithin that time it has produced just one man of extraordinary\npower and parts. This was Leon Gambetta. Other men as remarkable\nas he were conspicuous in French political life during the first\nfew years of the republic; but they belonged to an earlier\ngeneration, while Gambetta leaped into prominence only when the\nempire fell, crashing down in ruin and disaster.",
        "It is still too early to form an accurate estimate of him as a\nstatesman. His friends praise him extravagantly. His enemies still\nrevile him bitterly. The period of his political career lasted for\nlittle more than a decade, yet in that time it may be said that he\nlived almost a life of fifty years. Only a short time ago did the\nFrench government cause his body to be placed within the great\nPantheon, which contains memorials of the heroes and heroines of\nFrance. But, though we may not fairly judge of his political\nmotives, we can readily reconstruct a picture of him as a man, and\nin doing so recall his one romance, which many will remember after\nthey have forgotten his oratorical triumphs and his statecraft.",
        "Leon Gambetta was the true type of the southern Frenchman–what\nhis countrymen call a meridional. The Frenchman of the south is\ndifferent from the Frenchman of the north, for the latter has in\nhis veins a touch of the viking blood, so that he is very apt to\nbe fair-haired and blue-eyed, temperate in speech, and self-\ncontrolled. He is different, again, from the Frenchman of central\nFrance, who is almost purely Celtic. The meridional has a marked\nvein of the Italian in him, derived from the conquerors of ancient\nGaul. He is impulsive, ardent, fiery in speech, hot-tempered, and\nvivacious to an extraordinary degree.",
        "Gambetta, who was born at Cahors, was French only on his mother’s\nside, since his father was of Italian birth. It is said also that\nsomewhere in his ancestry there was a touch of the Oriental. At\nany rate, he was one of the most southern of the sons of southern\nFrance, and he showed the precocious maturity which belongs to a\ncertain type of Italian. At twenty-one he had already been\nadmitted to the French bar, and had drifted to Paris, where his\naudacity, his pushing nature, and his red-hot un-restraint of\nspeech gave him a certain notoriety from the very first.",
        "It was toward the end of the reign of Napoleon III. that Gambetta\nsaw his opportunity. The emperor, weakened by disease and yielding\nto a sort of feeble idealism, gave to France a greater freedom of\nspeech than it had enjoyed while he was more virile. This\nrelaxation of control merely gave to his opponents more courage to\nattack him and his empire. Demagogues harangued the crowds in\nwords which would once have led to their imprisonment. In the\nNational Assembly the opposition did all within its power to\nhamper and defeat the policy of the government.",
        "In short, republicanism began to rise in an ominous and\nthreatening way; and at the head of republicanism in Paris stood\nforth Gambetta, with his impassioned eloquence, his stinging\nphrases, and his youthful boldness. He became the idol of that\npart of Paris known as Belleville, where artisans and laborers\nunited with the rabble of the streets in hating the empire and in\ncrying out for a republic.",
        "Gambetta was precisely the man to voice the feelings of these\npeople. Whatever polish he acquired in after years was then quite\nlacking; and the crudity of his manners actually helped him with\nthe men whom he harangued. A recent book by M. Francis Laur, an\nardent admirer of Gambetta, gives a picture of the man which may\nbe nearly true of him in his later life, but which is certainly\ntoo flattering when applied to Gambetta in 1868, at the age of\nthirty.",
        "How do we see Gambetta as he was at thirty? A man of powerful\nframe and of intense vitality, with thick, clustering hair, which\nhe shook as a lion shakes its mane; olive-skinned, with eyes that\ndarted fire, a resonant, sonorous voice, and a personal magnetism\nwhich was instantly felt by all who met him or who heard him\nspeak. His manners were not refined. He was fond of oil and\ngarlic. His gestures were often more frantic than impressive, so\nthat his enemies called him “the furious fool.” He had a trick of\nspitting while he spoke. He was by no means the sort of man whose\nhabits had been formed in drawing-rooms or among people of good\nbreeding. Yet his oratory was, of its kind, superb.",
        "In 1869 Gambetta was elected by the Red Republicans to the Corps\nLegislatif. From the very first his vehemence and fire gained him\na ready hearing. The chamber itself was arranged like a great\ntheater, the members occupying the floor and the public the\ngalleries. Each orator in addressing the house mounted a sort of\nrostrum and from it faced the whole assemblage, not noticing, as\nwith us, the presiding officer at all. The very nature of this\narrangement stimulated parliamentary speaking into eloquence and\nflamboyant oratory.",
        "After Gambetta had spoken a few times he noticed in the gallery a\ntall, graceful woman, dressed in some neutral color and wearing\nlong black gloves, which accentuated the beauty of her hands and\narms. No one in the whole assembly paid such close attention to\nthe orator as did this woman, whom he had never seen before and\nwho appeared to be entirely alone.",
        "When it came to him to speak on another day he saw sitting in the\nsame place the same stately and yet lithe and sinuous figure. This\nwas repeated again and again, until at last whenever he came to a\npeculiarly fervid burst of oratory he turned to this woman’s face\nand saw it lighted up by the same enthusiasm which was stirring\nhim.",
        "Finally, in the early part of 1870, there came a day when Gambetta\nsurpassed himself in eloquence. His theme was the grandeur of\nrepublican government. Never in his life had he spoken so boldly\nas then, or with such fervor. The ministers of the emperor shrank\nback in dismay as this big-voiced, strong-limbed man hurled forth\nsentence after sentence like successive peals of irresistible\nartillery.",
        "As Gambetta rolled forth his sentences, superb in their rhetoric\nand all ablaze with that sort of intense feeling which masters an\norator in the moment of his triumph, the face of the lady in the\ngallery responded to him with wonderful appreciation. She was no\nlonger calm, unmoved, and almost severe. She flushed, and her eyes\nas they met his seemed to sparkle with living fire. When he\nfinished and descended from the rostrum he looked at her, and\ntheir eyes cried out as significantly as if the two had spoken to\neach other.",
        "Then Gambetta did what a person of finer breeding would not have\ndone. He hastily scribbled a note, sealed it, and called to his\nside one of the official pages. In the presence of the great\nassemblage, where he was for the moment the center of attention,\nhe pointed to the lady in the gallery and ordered the page to take\nthe note to her.",
        "One may excuse this only on the ground that he was completely\ncarried away by his emotion, so that to him there was no one\npresent save this enigmatically fascinating woman and himself. But\nthe lady on her side was wiser; or perhaps a slight delay gave her\ntime to recover her discretion. When Gambetta’s note was brought\nto her she took it quietly and tore it into little pieces without\nreading it; and then, rising, she glided through the crowd and\ndisappeared.",
        "Gambetta in his excitement had acted as if she were a mere\nadventuress. With perfect dignity she had shown him that she was a\nwoman who retained her self-respect.",
        "Immediately upon the heels of this curious incident came the\noutbreak of the war with Germany. In the war the empire was\nshattered at Sedan. The republic was proclaimed in Paris. The\nFrench capital was besieged by a vast German army. Gambetta was\nmade minister of the interior, and remained for a while in Paris\neven after it had been blockaded. But his fiery spirit chafed\nunder such conditions. He longed to go forth into the south of\nFrance and arouse his countrymen with a cry to arms against the\ninvaders.",
        "Escaping in a balloon, he safely reached the city of Tours; and\nthere he established what was practically a dictatorship. He flung\nhimself with tremendous energy into the task of organizing armies,\nof equipping them, and of directing their movements for the relief\nof Paris. He did, in fact, accomplish wonders. He kept the spirit\nof the nation still alive. Three new armies were launched against\nthe Germans. Gambetta was everywhere and took part in everything\nthat was done. His inexperience in military affairs, coupled with\nhis impatience of advice, led him to make serious mistakes.\nNevertheless, one of his armies practically defeated the Germans\nat Orleans; and could he have had his own way, even the fall of\nParis would not have ended the war.",
        "“Never,” said Gambetta, “shall I consent to peace so long as\nFrance still has two hundred thousand men under arms and more than\na thousand cannon to direct against the enemy!”",
        "But he was overruled by other and less fiery statesmen. Peace was\nmade, and Gambetta retired for a moment into private life. If he\nhad not succeeded in expelling the German hosts he had, at any\nrate, made Bismarck hate him, and he had saved the honor of\nFrance.",
        "It was while the National Assembly at Versailles was debating the\nterms of peace with Germany that Gambetta once more delivered a\nnoble and patriotic speech. As he concluded he felt a strange\nmagnetic attraction; and, sweeping the audience with a glance, he\nsaw before him, not very far away, the same woman with the long\nblack gloves, having about her still an air of mystery, but again\nmeeting his eyes with her own, suffused with feeling.",
        "Gambetta hurried to an anteroom and hastily scribbled the\nfollowing note:",
        "At last I see you once more. Is it really you?",
        "The scrawl was taken to her by a discreet official, and this time\nshe received the letter, pressed it to her heart, and then slipped\nit into the bodice of her gown. But this time, as before, she left\nwithout making a reply.",
        "It was an encouragement, yet it gave no opening to Gambetta–for\nshe returned to the National Assembly no more. But now his heart\nwas full of hope, for he was convinced with a very deep conviction\nthat somewhere, soon, and in some way he would meet this woman,\nwho had become to him one of the intense realities of his life. He\ndid not know her name. They had never exchanged a word. Yet he was\nsure that time would bring them close together.",
        "His intuition was unerring. What we call chance often seems to\nknow what it is doing. Within a year after the occurrence that has\njust been narrated an old friend of Gambetta’s met with an\naccident which confined him to his house. The statesman strolled\nto his friend’s residence. The accident was a trifling one, and\nthe mistress of the house was holding a sort of informal\nreception, answering questions that were asked her by the numerous\nacquaintances who called.",
        "As Gambetta was speaking, of a sudden he saw before him, at the\nextremity of the room, the lady of his dreams, the sphinx of his\nwaking hours, the woman who four years earlier had torn up the\nnote which he addressed to her, but who more recently had kept his\nwritten words. Both of them were deeply agitated, yet both of them\ncarried off the situation without betraying themselves to others,\nGambetta approached, and they exchanged a few casual commonplaces.\nBut now, close together, eye and voice spoke of what was in their\nhearts.",
        "Presently the lady took her leave. Gambetta followed closely. In\nthe street he turned to her and said in pleading tones:",
        "“Why did you destroy my letter? You knew I loved you, and yet all\nthese years you have kept away from me in silence.”",
        "Then the girl–for she was little more than a girl–hesitated for\na moment. As he looked upon her face he saw that her eyes were\nfull of tears. At last she spoke with emotion:",
        "“You cannot love me, for I am unworthy of you. Do not urge me. Do\nnot make promises. Let us say good-by. At least I must first tell\nyou of my story, for I am one of those women whom no one ever\nmarries.”",
        "Gambetta brushed aside her pleadings. He begged that he might see\nher soon. Little by little she consented; but she would not see\nhim at her house. She knew that his enemies were many and that\neverything he did would be used against him. In the end she agreed\nto meet him in the park at Versailles, near the Petit Trianon, at\neight o’clock in the morning.",
        "When she had made this promise he left her. Already a new\ninspiration had come to him, and he felt that with this woman by\nhis side he could accomplish anything.",
        "At the appointed hour, in the silence of the park and amid the\nsunshine of the beautiful morning, the two met once again.\nGambetta seized her hands with eagerness and cried out in an\nexultant tone:",
        "“At last! At last! At last!”",
        "But the woman’s eyes were heavy with sorrow, and upon her face\nthere was a settled melancholy. She trembled at his touch and\nalmost shrank from him. Here was seen the impetuosity of the\nmeridional. He had first spoken to this woman only two days\nbefore. He knew nothing of her station, of her surroundings, of\nher character. He did not even know her name. Yet one thing he\nknew absolutely–that she was made for him and that he must have\nher for his own. He spoke at once of marriage; but at this she\ndrew away from him still farther.",
        "“No,” she said. “I told you that you must not speak to me until\nyou have heard my story.”",
        "He led her to a great stone bench near by; and, passing his arm\nabout her waist, he drew her head down to his shoulder as he said:",
        "“Well, tell me. I will listen.”",
        "Then this girl of twenty-four, with perfect frankness, because she\nwas absolutely loyal, told him why she felt that they must never\nsee each other any more-much less marry and be happy. She was the\ndaughter of a colonel in the French army. The sudden death of her\nfather had left her penniless and alone. Coming to Paris at the\nage of eighteen, she had given lessons in the household of a high\nofficer of the empire. This man had been attracted by her beauty,\nand had seduced her.",
        "Later she had secured the means of living modestly, realizing more\ndeeply each month how dreadful had been her fate and how she had\nbeen cut off from the lot of other girls. She felt that her life\nmust be a perpetual penance for what had befallen her through her\nignorance and inexperience. She told Gambetta that her name was\nLeonie Leon. As is the custom of Frenchwomen who live alone, she\nstyled herself madame. It is doubtful whether the name by which\nshe passed was that which had been given to her at baptism; but,\nif so, her true name has never been disclosed.",
        "When she had told the whole of her sad story to Gambetta he made\nnothing of it. She said to him again:",
        "“You cannot love me. I should only dim your fame. You can have\nnothing in common with a dishonored, ruined girl. That is what I\ncame here to explain to you. Let us part, and let us for all time\nforget each other.”",
        "But Gambetta took no heed of what she said. Now that he had found\nher, he would not consent to lose her. He seized her slender hands\nand covered them with kisses. Again he urged that she should marry\nhim.",
        "Her answer was a curious one. She was a devoted Catholic and would\nnot regard any marriage as valid save a religious marriage. On the\nother hand, Gambetta, though not absolutely irreligious, was\nleading the opposition to the Catholic party in France. The Church\nto him was not so much a religious body as a political one, and to\nit he was unalterably opposed. Personally, he would have no\nobjections to being married by a priest; but as a leader of the\nanti-clerical party he felt that he must not recognize the\nChurch’s claim in any way. A religious marriage would destroy his\ninfluence with his followers and might even imperil the future of\nthe republic.",
        "They pleaded long and earnestly both then and afterward. He urged\na civil marriage, but she declared that only a marriage according\nto the rites of the Church could ever purify her past and give her\nback her self-respect. In this she was absolutely stubborn, yet\nshe did not urge upon Gambetta that he should destroy his\ninfluence by marrying her in church.",
        "Through all this interplay of argument and pleading and emotion\nthe two grew every moment more hopelessly in love. Then the woman,\nwith a woman’s curious subtlety and indirectness, reached a\nsomewhat singular conclusion. She would hear nothing of a civil\nmarriage, because a civil marriage was no marriage in the eyes of\nPope and prelate. On the other hand, she did not wish Gambetta to\nmar his political career by going through a religious ceremony.\nShe had heard from a priest that the Church recognized two forms\nof betrothal. The usual one looked to a marriage in the future and\ngave no marriage privileges until after the formal ceremony. But\nthere was another kind of betrothal known to the theologians as\nsponsalia de praesente. According to this, if there were an actual\nbetrothal, the pair might have the privileges and rights of\nmarriage immediately, if only they sincerely meant to be married\nin the future.",
        "The eager mind of Leonie Leon caught at this bit of ecclesiastical\nlaw and used it with great ingenuity.",
        "“Let us,” she said, “be formally betrothed by the interchange of a\nring, and let us promise each other to marry in the future. After\nsuch a betrothal as this we shall be the same as married; for we\nshall be acting according to the laws of the Church.”",
        "Gambetta gladly gave his promise. A betrothal ring was purchased;\nand then, her conscience being appeased, she gave herself\ncompletely to her lover. Gambetta was sincere. He said to her:",
        "“If the time should ever come when I shall lose my political\nstation, when I am beaten in the struggle, when I am deserted and\nalone, will you not then marry me when I ask you?”",
        "And Leonie, with her arms about his neck, promised that she would.\nYet neither of them specified what sort of marriage this should\nbe, nor did it seem at the moment as if the question could arise.",
        "For Gambetta was very powerful. He led his party to success in the\nelection of 1877. Again and again his triumphant oratory mastered\nthe National Assembly of France. In 1879 he was chosen to be\npresident of the Chamber of Deputies. He towered far above the\npresident of the republic–Jules Grevy, that hard-headed, close-\nfisted old peasant–and his star had reached its zenith.",
        "All this time he and Leonie Leon maintained their intimacy, though\nit was carefully concealed save from a very few. She lived in a\nplain but pretty house on the Avenue Perrichont in the quiet\nquarter of Auteuil; but Gambetta never came there. Where and when\nthey met was a secret guarded very carefully by the few who were\nhis close associates. But meet they did continually, and their\naffection grew stronger every year. Leonie thrilled at the\nvictories of the man she loved; and he found joy in the hours that\nhe spent with her.",
        "Gambetta’s need of rest was very great, for he worked at the\nhighest tension, like an engine which is using every pound of\nsteam. Bismarck, whose spies kept him well informed of everything\nthat was happening in Paris, and who had no liking for Gambetta,\nsince the latter always spoke of him as “the Ogre,” once said to a\nFrenchman named Cheberry:",
        "“He is the only one among you who thinks of revenge, and who is\nany sort of a menace to Germany. But, fortunately, he won’t last\nmuch longer. I am not speaking thoughtlessly. I know from secret\nreports what sort of a life your great man leads, and I know his\nhabits. Why, his life is a life of continual overwork. He rests\nneither night nor day. All politicians who have led the same life\nhave died young. To he able to serve one’s country for a long time\na statesman must marry an ugly woman, have children like the rest\nof the world, and a country place or a house to one’s self like\nany common peasant, where he can go and rest.”",
        "The Iron Chancellor chuckled as he said this, and he was right.\nAnd yet Gambetta’s end came not so much through overwork as by an\naccident.",
        "It may be that the ambition of Mme. Leon stimulated him beyond his\npowers. However this may be, early in 1882, when he was defeated\nin Parliament on a question which he considered vital, he\nimmediately resigned and turned his back on public life. His\nfickle friends soon deserted him. His enemies jeered and hooted\nthe mention of his name.",
        "He had reached the time which with a sort of prophetic instinct he\nhad foreseen nearly ten years before. So he turned to the woman\nwho had been faithful and loving to him; and he turned to her with\na feeling of infinite peace.",
        "“You promised me,” he said, “that if ever I was defeated and alone\nyou would marry me. The time is now.”",
        "Then this man, who had exercised the powers of a dictator, who had\nlevied armies and shaken governments, and through whose hands\nthere had passed thousands of millions of francs, sought for a\ncountry home. He found for sale a small estate which had once\nbelonged to Balzac, and which is known as Les Jardies. It was in\nwretched repair; yet the small sum which it cost Gambetta–twelve\nthousand francs–was practically all that he possessed. Worn and\nweary as he was, it seemed to him a haven of delightful peace; for\nhere he might live in the quiet country with the still beautiful\nwoman who was soon to become his wife.",
        "It is not known what form of marriage they at last agreed upon.\nShe may have consented to a civil ceremony; or he, being now out\nof public life, may have felt that he could be married by the\nChurch. The day for their wedding had been set, and Gambetta was\nalready at Les Jardies. But there came a rumor that he had been\nshot. Still further tidings bore the news that he was dying.\nParis, fond as it was of scandals, immediately spread the tale\nthat he had been shot by a jealous woman.",
        "The truth is quite the contrary. Gambetta, in arranging his\neffects in his new home, took it upon himself to clean a pair of\ndueling-pistols; for every French politician of importance must\nfight duels, and Gambetta had already done so. Unfortunately, one\ncartridge remained unnoticed in the pistol which Gambetta cleaned.\nAs he held the pistol-barrel against the soft part of his hand the\ncartridge exploded, and the ball passed through the base of the\nthumb with a rending, spluttering noise.",
        "The wound was not in itself serious, but now the prophecy of\nBismarck was fulfilled. Gambetta had exhausted his vitality; a\nfever set in, and before long he died of internal ulceration.",
        "This was the end of a great career and of a great romance of love.\nLeonie Leon was half distraught at the death of the lover who was\nso soon to be her husband. She wandered for hours in the forest\nuntil she reached a convent, where she was received. Afterward she\ncame to Paris and hid herself away in a garret of the slums. All\nthe light of her life had gone out. She wished that she had died\nwith him whose glory had been her life. Friends of Gambetta,\nhowever, discovered her and cared for her until her death, long\nafterward, in 1906.",
        "She lived upon the memories of the past, of the swift love that\nhad come at first sight, but which had lasted unbrokenly; which\nhad given her the pride of conquest, and which had brought her\nlover both happiness and inspiration and a refining touch which\nhad smoothed away his roughness and made him fit to stand in\npalaces with dignity and distinction.",
        "As for him, he left a few lines which have been carefully\npreserved, and which sum up his thought of her. They read:",
        "To the light of my soul; to the star, of my life–Leonie Leon. For\never! For ever!",
