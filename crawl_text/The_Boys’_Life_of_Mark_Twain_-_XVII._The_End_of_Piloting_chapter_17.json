        "When one remembers how much Samuel Clemens loved the river, and how\nperfectly he seemed suited to the ease and romance of the pilot-life, one\nis almost tempted to regret that it should so soon have come to an end.",
        "Those trips of early ’61, which the old note-book records, were the last\nhe would ever make.  The golden days of Mississippi steam-boating were\ngrowing few.",
        "Nobody, however, seemed to suspect it.  Even a celebrated fortune-teller\nin New Orleans, whom the young pilot one day consulted as to his future,\ndid not mention the great upheaval then close at hand.  She told him\nquite remarkable things, and gave him some excellent advice, but though\nthis was February, 1861, she failed to make any mention of the Civil War!\nYet, a month later, Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated and trouble was in\nthe air.  Then in April Fort Sumter was fired upon and the war had come.",
        "It was a feverish time among the pilots.  Some were for the Union–others\nwould go with the Confederacy.  Horace Bixby stood for the North, and in\ntime was chief of the Union river-service.  A pilot named Montgomery\n(Clemens had once steered for him) went with the South and by and by\ncommanded the Confederate Mississippi fleet.  In the beginning a good\nmany were not clear as to their opinions.  Living both North and South,\nas they did, they divided their sympathies.  Samuel Clemens was\nthoughtful, and far from bloodthirsty.  A pilothouse, so fine and showy\nin times of peace, seemed a poor place to be in when fighting was going\non.  He would consider the matter.",
        "“I am not anxious to get up into a glass perch and be shot at by either\nside,” he said.  “I’ll go home and reflect.”",
        "He went up the river as a passenger on a steamer named the “Uncle Sam.\"\nZeb Leavenworth, formerly of the “John J. Roe,” was one of the pilots,\nand Clemens usually stood the watch with him.  At Memphis they barely\nescaped the blockade.  At Cairo they saw soldiers drilling–troops later\ncommanded by Grant.",
        "The “Uncle Sam” came steaming up to St. Louis, glad to have slipped\nthrough safely.  They were not quite through, however.  Abreast of\nJefferson Barracks they heard the boom of a cannon, and a great ring of\nsmoke drifted in their direction.  They did not recognize it as a\nthunderous “Halt!” and kept on.  Less than a minute later, a shell\nexploded directly in front of the pilot-house, breaking a lot of glass\nand damaging the decoration.  Zeb Leavenworth tumbled into a corner.",
        "“Gee-mighty, Sam!” he said.  “What do they mean by that?”",
        "Clemens stepped from the visitors’ bench to the wheel and brought the\nboat around.",
        "“I guess–they want us–to wait a minute–Zeb,” he said.",
        "They were examined and passed.  It was the last steamboat to make the\ntrip through from New Orleans to St. Louis.  Mark Twain’s pilot days were\nover.  He would have grieved had he known this fact.",
        "“I loved the profession far better than any I have followed since,” he\nlong afterward declared, “and I took a measureless pride in it.”",
        "At the time, like many others, he expected the war to be brief, and his\nlife to be only temporarily interrupted.  Within a year, certainly, he\nwould be back in the pilot-house.  Meantime the war must be settled; he\nwould go up to Hannibal to see about it.",
