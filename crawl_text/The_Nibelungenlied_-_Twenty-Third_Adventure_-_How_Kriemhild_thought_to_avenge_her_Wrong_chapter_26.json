        "In full lordly honor, / –truth is that ye hear–\nDwelt they with each other / until the seventh year.\nMeanwhile Lady Kriemhild / a son to Etzel bore,\nNor gladder might the monarch / be o’er aught for evermore.",
        "1388",
        "Yet would she not give over, / nor with aught be reconciled,\nBut that should be baptized / the royal Etzel’s child\nAfter Christian custom: / Ortlieb they did him call.\nThereat was mickle joyance / over Etzel’s borders all.",
        "1389",
        "Whate’er of highest virtues / in Lady Helke lay,\nStrove the Lady Kriemhild / to rival her each day.\nHerrat the stranger maiden / many a grace she taught,\nWho yet with secret pining / for her mistress Helke was distraught.",
        "1390",
        "To stranger and to native / full well she soon was known,\nNe’er monarch’s country, said they, / did royal mistress own\nThat gave with freer bounty, / that held they without fear.\nSuch praise she bore in Hunland, / until was come the thirteenth year.",
        "1391",
        "Now had she well perceived / how all obeyed her will,\nAs service to royal mistress / king’s knights do render still,\nAnd how at every season / twelve kings ’fore her were seen.\nShe thought of many a sorrow / that wrought upon her once had been.",
        "1392",
        "Eke thought she of lordly power / in Nibelungenland\nThat she erstwhile had wielded, / and how that Hagen’s hand\nOf it all had reft her / with her lord Siegfried dead;\nShe thought for so great evil / how might he ever be repaid.",
        "1393",
        "“’Twould be, might I but bring him / hither into this land.\"\nShe dreamed that fondly led her / full often by the hand\nGiselher her brother, / full oft in gentle sleep\nThought she to have kissed him, / wherefrom he sorrow soon must reap.",
        "1394",
        "I ween the evil demon / was Kriemhild’s counsellor\nThat she her peace with Gunther / should sacred keep no more,\nWhom she kissed in friendly token / in the land of Burgundy.\nAdown upon her bosom / the burning tears fell heavily.",
        "1395",
        "On her heart both late and early / lay the heavy thought,\nHow that, herself all guiltless, / thereto she had been brought,\nThat she must share in exile / a heathen monarch’s bed.\nThrough Hagen eke and Gunther / come she was to such sore need.",
        "1396",
        "From her heart such longing / seldom might she dismiss.\nThought she: “A queen so mighty / I am o’er wealth like this,\nThat I upon mine enemies / may yet avenge me well.\nFain were I that on Hagen / of Tronje yet my vengeance fell.",
        "1397",
        "“For friends that once were faithful / full oft my heart doth long.\nWere they but here beside me / that wrought on me such wrong,\nThen were in sooth avenged / my lover reft of life;\nScarce may I bide that hour,\" / spake the royal Etzel’s wife.",
        "1398",
        "Kriemhild they loved and honored, / the monarch’s men each one,\nAs they that came there with her: / well might the same be done.\nThe treasure wielded Eckewart, / and won good knights thereby.\nThe will of Lady Kriemhild might / none in all that land deny.",
        "1399",
        "She mused at every season: / “The king himself I’ll pray,\"–\nThat he to her the favor / might grant in friendly way,\nTo bring her kinsmen hither / unto Hunland.\nWhat vengeful thought she cherished / might none soever understand.",
        "1400",
        "As she in stillest night-time / by the monarch lay\n(In his arms enclosed he held her, / as he was wont alway\nTo caress the noble lady: / she was to him as life),\nAgain unto her enemies / turned her thoughts his stately wife.",
        "1401",
        "She spake unto the monarch: / “My lord full dear to me,\nNow would I pray a favor, / if with thy grace it be,\nThat thou wilt show unto me / if merit such be mine\nThat unto my good kinsmen / truly doth thy heart incline.”",
        "1402",
        "The mighty monarch answered / (from guile his heart was free):\n“Of a truth I tell thee, / if aught of good may be\nThe fortune of thy kinsmen, / –of that I were full fain,\nFor ne’er through love of woman / might I friends more faithful gain.”",
        "1403",
        "Thereat again spake Kriemhild: / “That mayst thou well believe,\nFull high do stand my kinsmen; / the more it doth me grieve\nThat they deign so seldom / hither to take their way.\nThat here I live a stranger, / oft I hear the people say.”",
        "1404",
        "Then spake the royal Etzel: / “Beloved lady mine,\nSeemed not too far the journey, / I’d bid from yond the Rhine\nWhom thou wouldst gladly welcome / hither unto my land.\"\nThereat rejoiced the lady / when she his will did understand.",
        "1405",
        "Spake she: “Wilt thou true favor / show me, master mine,\nThen shall thou speed thy messengers / to Worms across the Rhine.\nWere but my friends acquainted / what thing of them I would,\nThen to this land came hither / full many a noble knight and good.”",
        "1406",
        "He spake: “Whene’er thou biddest, / straight the thing shall be.\nThyself mightst ne’er thy kinsmen / here so gladly see,\nAs I the sons of Ute, / high and stately queen.\nIt grieveth me full sorely / that strangers here so long they’ve been.",
        "1407",
        "“If this thing doth please thee, / beloved lady mine,\nThen gladly send I thither / unto those friends of thine\nAs messengers my minstrels / to the land of Burgundy.\"\nHe bade the merry fiddlers / lead before him presently.",
        "1408",
        "Then hastened they full quickly / to where they found the king\nBy side of Kriemhild sitting. / He told them straight the thing,\nHow they should be his messengers / to Burgundy to fare.\nFull stately raiment bade he / for them straightway eke prepare.",
        "1409",
        "Four and twenty warriors / did they apparel well.\nLikewise did the monarch / to them the message tell,\nHow that they King Gunther / and his men should bid aright.\nThem eke the Lady Kriemhild / to secret parley did invite.",
        "1410",
        "Then spake the mighty monarch: / “Now well my words attend.\nAll good and friendly greeting / unto my friends I send,\nThat they may deign to journey / hither to my country.\nFew be the guests beside them / that were so welcome unto me.",
        "1411",
        "“And if they be so minded / to meet my will in aught,\nKriemhild’s lofty kinsmen, / that they forego it not\nTo come upon the summer / here where I hold hightide,\nFor that my joy in living / doth greatly with my friends abide.”",
        "1412",
        "Then spake the fiddle-player, / Schwemmelein full bold:\n“When thinkst thou in this country / such high feast to hold,\nThat unto thy friends yonder / tell the same we may?\"\nThereto spake King Etzel: / “When next hath come midsummer day.”",
        "1413",
        "“We’ll do as thou commandest,\" / spake then Werbelein.\nUnto her own chamber / commanded then the queen\nTo bring in secret manner / the messengers alone.\nThereby did naught but sorrow / befall full many a thane anon.",
        "1414",
        "She spake unto the messengers: / “Mickle wealth I give to you,\nIf my will in this matter / right faithfully ye do,\nAnd bear what tidings send I / home unto our country.\nI’ll make you rich in treasure / and fair apparelled shall ye be.",
        "1415",
        "“And friends of mine so many / as ever see ye may\nAt Worms by Rhine river, / to them ye ne’er shall say\nThat any mood of sorrow / in me ye yet have seen.\nSay ye that I commend me / unto the knights full brave and keen.”",
        "1416",
        "“Pray them that to King Etzel’s / message they give heed,\nThereby to relieve me / of all my care and need,\nElse shall the Huns imagine / that I all friendless am.\nIf I but a knight were, / oft would they see me at their home.",
        "1417",
        "“Eke say ye unto Gernot, / brother to me full dear,\nTo him might never any / disposed be more fair;\nPray him that he bring hither / unto this country\nAll our friends most steadfast, / that we thereby shall honored be.",
        "1418",
        "“Say further eke to Giselher / that he do have in mind,\nThat by his guilt I never / did cause for sorrow find;\nHim therefore would I gladly / here with mine own eyes see,\nAnd give him warmest welcome, / so faithful hath he been to me.",
        "1419",
        "“How I am held in honor, / to my mother eke make plain.\nAnd if of Tronje Hagen / hath mind there to remain,\nBy whom might they in coming / through unknown lands be shown?\nThe way to Hunland hither / from youth to him hath well been known.”",
        "1420",
        "No whit knew the messengers / wherefore she did advise\nThat they of Tronje Hagen / should not in any wise\nLeave by the Rhine to tarry. / That was anon their bane:\nThrough him to dire destruction / was doomed full many a doughty thane.",
        "1421",
        "Letters and kindly greeting / now to them they give;\nThey fared from thence rich laden, / and merrily might live.\nLeave then they took of Etzel / and eke his lady fair,\nAnd parted on their journey / dight in apparel rich and rare.",
