        "It was February off the Banks, and so thick was the weather that,\non the upper decks, one could have driven a sleigh. Inside the\nsmoking-room Austin Ford, as securely sheltered from the blizzard\nas though he had been sitting in front of a wood fire at his club,\nordered hot gin for himself and the ship’s doctor. The ship’s\ndoctor had gone below on another “hurry call” from the widow. At\nthe first luncheon on board the widow had sat on the right of\nDoctor Sparrow, with Austin Ford facing her. But since then,\nexcept to the doctor, she had been invisible. So, at frequent\nintervals, the ill health of the widow had deprived Ford of the\nsociety of the doctor. That it deprived him, also, of the society\nof the widow did not concern him. HER life had not been spent upon\nocean liners; she could not remember when state-rooms were named\nafter the States of the Union. She could not tell him of\nshipwrecks and salvage, of smugglers and of the modern pirates who\nfound their victims in the smoking-room.",
        "Ford was on his way to England to act as the London correspondent\nof the New York Republic. For three years on that most sensational\nof the New York dailies he had been the star man, the chief\nmuckraker, the chief sleuth. His interest was in crime. Not in\ncrimes committed in passion or inspired by drink, but in such\noffences against law and society as are perpetrated with nice\nintelligence. The murderer, the burglar, the strong-arm men who,\nin side streets, waylay respectable citizens did not appeal to him.\nThe man he studied, pursued, and exposed was the cashier who\nevolved a new method of covering up his peculations, the dishonest\npresident of an insurance company, the confidence man who used no\nconcealed weapon other than his wit. Toward the criminals he\npursued young Ford felt no personal animosity. He harassed them as\nhe would have shot a hawk killing chickens. Not because he\ndisliked the hawk, but because the battle was unequal, and because\nhe felt sorry for the chickens.",
        "Had you called Austin Ford an amateur detective he would have been\ngreatly annoyed. He argued that his position was similar to that\nof the dramatic critic. The dramatic critic warned the public\nagainst bad plays; Ford warned it against bad men. Having done\nthat, he left it to the public to determine whether the bad man\nshould thrive or perish.",
        "When the managing editor told him of his appointment to London,\nFord had protested that his work lay in New York; that of London\nand the English, except as a tourist and sight-seer, he knew\nnothing.",
        "“That’s just why we are sending you,” explained the managing\neditor. “Our readers are ignorant. To make them read about London\nyou’ve got to tell them about themselves in London. They like to\nknow who’s been presented at court, about the American girls who\nhave married dukes; and which ones opened a bazaar, and which one\nopened a hat shop, and which is getting a divorce. Don’t send us\nanything concerning suffragettes and Dreadnaughts. Just send us\nstuff about Americans. If you take your meals in the Carlton\ngrill-room and drink at the Cecil you can pick up more good stories\nthan we can print. You will find lots of your friends over there.\nSome of those girls who married dukes,” he suggested, “know you,\ndon’t they?”",
        "“Not since they married dukes,” said Ford.",
        "“Well, anyway, all your other friends will be there,” continued the\nmanaging editor encouragingly. “Now that they have shut up the\ntracks here all the con men have gone to London. They say an\nAmerican can’t take a drink at the Salisbury without his fellow-\ncountrymen having a fight as to which one will sell him a gold\nbrick.”",
        "Ford’s eyes lightened in pleasurable anticipation.",
        "“Look them over,” urged the managing editor, “and send us a\nspecial. Call it ’The American Invasion.’ Don’t you see a story\nin it?”",
        "“It will be the first one I send you,” said Ford. The ship’s\ndoctor returned from his visit below decks and sank into the\nleather cushion close to Ford’s elbow. For a few moments the older\nman sipped doubtfully at his gin and water, and, as though\nperplexed, rubbed his hand over his bald and shining head. “I told\nher to talk to you,” he said fretfully.",
        "“Her? Who?” inquired Ford. “Oh, the widow?”",
        "“You were right about that,” said Doctor Sparrow; “she is not a\nwidow.”",
        "The reporter smiled complacently.",
        "“Do you know why I thought not?” he demanded. “Because all the\ntime she was at luncheon she kept turning over her wedding-ring as\nthough she was not used to it. It was a new ring, too. I told you\nthen she was not a widow.”",
        "“Do you always notice things like that?” asked the doctor.",
        "“Not on purpose,” said the amateur detective; “I can’t help it. I\nsee ten things where other people see only one; just as some men\nrun ten times as fast as other men. We have tried it out often at\nthe office; put all sorts of junk under a newspaper, lifted the\nnewspaper for five seconds, and then each man wrote down what he\nhad seen. Out of twenty things I would remember seventeen. The\nnext best guess would be about nine. Once I saw a man lift his\ncoat collar to hide his face. It was in the Grand Central Station.\nI stopped him, and told him he was wanted. Turned out he WAS\nwanted. It was Goldberg, making his getaway to Canada.”",
        "“It is a gift,” said the doctor.",
        "“No, it’s a nuisance,” laughed the reporter. “I see so many things\nI don’t want to see. I see that people are wearing clothes that\nare not made for them. I see when women are lying to me. I can\nsee when men are on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and whether\nit is drink or debt or morphine--”",
        "The doctor snorted triumphantly.",
        "“You did not see that the widow was on the verge of a breakdown!”",
        "“No,” returned the reporter. “Is she? I’m sorry.”",
        "“If you’re sorry,” urged the doctor eagerly, you’ll help her. She\nis going to London alone to find her husband. He has disappeared.\nShe thinks that he has been murdered, or that he is lying ill in\nsome hospital. I told her if any one could help her to find him\nyou could. I had to say something. She’s very ill.”",
        "“To find her husband in London?” repeated Ford. “London is a large\ntown.”",
        "“She has photographs of him and she knows where he spends his\ntime,” pleaded the doctor. “He is a company promoter. It should\nbe easy for you.”",
        "“Maybe he doesn’t want her to find him,” said Ford. “Then it\nwouldn’t be so easy for me.”",
        "The old doctor sighed heavily. “I know,” he murmured. “I thought\nof that, too. And she is so very pretty.”",
        "“That was another thing I noticed,” said Ford.",
        "The doctor gave no heed.",
        "“She must stop worrying,” he exclaimed, “or she will have a mental\ncollapse. I have tried sedatives, but they don’t touch her. I\nwant to give her courage. She is frightened. She’s left a baby\nboy at home, and she’s fearful that something will happen to him,\nand she’s frightened at being at sea, frightened at being alone in\nLondon; it’s pitiful.” The old man shook his head. “Pitiful!\nWill you talk to her now?” he asked.",
        "“Nonsense!” exclaimed Ford. “She doesn’t want to tell the story of\nher life to strange young men.”",
        "“But it was she suggested it,” cried the doctor. “She asked me if\nyou were Austin Ford, the great detective.”",
        "Ford snorted scornfully. “She did not!” he protested. His tone\nwas that of a man who hopes to be contradicted.",
        "“But she did,” insisted the doctor, “and I told her your specialty\nwas tracing persons. Her face lightened at once; it gave her hope.\nShe will listen to you. Speak very gently and kindly and\nconfidently. Say you are sure you can find him.”",
        "“Where is the lady now?” asked Ford.",
        "Doctor Sparrow scrambled eagerly to his feet. “She cannot leave\nher cabin,” he answered.",
        "The widow, as Ford and Doctor Sparrow still thought of her, was\nlying on the sofa that ran the length of the state-room, parallel\nwith the lower berth. She was fully dressed, except that instead\nof her bodice she wore a kimono that left her throat and arms bare.\nShe had been sleeping, and when their entrance awoke her, her blue\neyes regarded them uncomprehendingly. Ford, hidden from her by the\ndoctor, observed that not only was she very pretty, but that she\nwas absurdly young, and that the drowsy smile she turned upon the\nold man before she noted the presence of Ford was as innocent as\nthat of a baby. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes brilliant, her\nyellow curls had become loosened and were spread upon the pillow.\nWhen she saw Ford she caught the kimono so closely around her\nthroat that she choked. Had the doctor not pushed her down she\nwould have stood.",
        "“I thought,” she stammered, “he was an OLD man.”",
        "The doctor, misunderstanding, hastened to reassure her. “Mr. Ford\nis old in experience,” he said soothingly. “He has had remarkable\nsuccess. Why, he found a criminal once just because the man wore a\ncollar. And he found Walsh, the burglar, and Phillips, the forger,\nand a gang of counterfeiters--”",
        "Mrs. Ashton turned upon him, her eyes wide with wonder. “But MY\nhusband,” she protested, “is not a criminal!”",
        "“My dear lady!” the doctor cried. “I did not mean that, of course\nnot. I meant, if Mr. Ford can find men who don’t wish to be found,\nhow easy for him to find a man who--” He turned helplessly to\nFord. “You tell her,” he begged.",
        "Ford sat down on a steamer trunk that protruded from beneath the\nberth, and, turning to the widow, gave her the full benefit of his\nworking smile. It was confiding, helpless, appealing. It showed a\ntrustfulness in the person to whom it was addressed that caused\nthat individual to believe Ford needed protection from a wicked\nworld.",
        "“Doctor Sparrow tells me,” began Ford timidly, “you have lost your\nhusband’s address; that you will let me try to find him. If I can\nhelp in any way I should be glad.”",
        "The young girl regarded him, apparently, with disappointment. It\nwas as though Doctor Sparrow had led her to expect a man full of\nyears and authority, a man upon whom she could lean; not a youth\nwhose smile seemed to beg one not to scold him. She gave Ford\nthree photographs, bound together with a string.",
        "“When Doctor Sparrow told me you could help me I got out these,\"\nshe said.",
        "Ford jotted down a mental note to the effect that she “got them\nout.” That is, she did not keep them where she could always look\nat them. That she was not used to look at them was evident by the\nfact that they were bound together.",
        "The first photograph showed three men standing in an open place and\nleaning on a railing. One of them was smiling toward the\nphotographer. He was a good-looking young man of about thirty\nyears of age, well fed, well dressed, and apparently well satisfied\nwith the world and himself. Ford’s own smile had disappeared. His\neyes were alert and interested.",
        "“The one with the Panama hat pulled down over his eyes is your\nhusband?” he asked.",
        "“Yes,” assented the widow. Her tone showed slight surprise.",
        "“This was taken about a year ago?” inquired Ford. “Must have\nbeen,” he answered himself; “they haven’t raced at the Bay since\nthen. This was taken in front of the club stand--probably for the\nTelegraph?” He lifted his eyes inquiringly.",
        "Rising on her elbow the young wife bent forward toward the\nphotograph. “Does it say that there,” she asked doubtfully. “How\ndid you guess that?”",
        "In his role as chorus the ship’s doctor exclaimed with enthusiasm:\n“Didn’t I tell you? He’s wonderful.”",
        "Ford cut him off impatiently. “You never saw a rail as high as\nthat except around a racetrack,” he muttered. “And the badge in\nhis buttonhole and the angle of the stand all show--”",
        "He interrupted himself to address the widow. “This is an owner’s\nbadge. What was the name of his stable?”",
        "“I don’t know,” she answered. She regarded the young man with\nsudden uneasiness. “They only owned one horse, but I believe that\ngave them the privilege of--”",
        "“I see,” exclaimed Ford. “Your husband is a bookmaker. But in\nLondon he is a promoter of companies.”",
        "“So my friend tells me,” said Mrs. Ashton. “She’s just got back\nfrom London. Her husband told her that Harry, my husband, was\nalways at the American bar in the Cecil or at the Salisbury or the\nSavoy.” The girl shook her head. “But a woman can’t go looking\nfor a man there,” she protested. “That’s, why I thought you--”",
        "“That’ll be all right,” Ford assured her hurriedly. “It’s a\ncoincidence, but it happens that my own work takes me to these\nhotels, and if your husband is there I will find him.” He returned\nthe photographs.",
        "“Hadn’t you better keep one?” she asked.",
        "“I won’t forget him,” said the reporter. “Besides\"--he turned his\neyes toward the doctor and, as though thinking aloud, said--\"he may\nhave grown a beard.”",
        "There was a pause.",
        "The eyes of the woman grew troubled. Her lips pressed together as\nthough in a sudden access of pain.",
        "“And he may,” Ford continued, “have changed his name.”",
        "As though fearful, if she spoke, the tears would fall, the girl\nnodded her head stiffly.",
        "Having learned what he wanted to know Ford applied to the wound a\nsoothing ointment of promises and encouragement.",
        "“He’s as good as found,” he protested. “You will see him in a day,\ntwo days after you land.”",
        "The girl’s eyes opened happily. She clasped her hands together and\nraised them.",
        "“You will try?” she begged. “You will find him for me\"--she\ncorrected herself eagerly--\"for me and the baby?”",
        "The loose sleeves of the kimono fell back to her shoulders showing\nthe white arms; the eyes raised to Ford were glistening with tears.",
        "“Of course I will find him,” growled the reporter.",
        "He freed himself from the appeal in the eyes of the young mother\nand left the cabin. The doctor followed. He was bubbling over\nwith enthusiasm.",
        "“That was fine!” he cried. “You said just the right thing. There\nwill be no collapse now.”",
        "His satisfaction was swept away in a burst of disgust.",
        "“The blackguard!” he protested. “To desert a wife as young as that\nand as pretty as that.”",
        "“So I have been thinking,” said the reporter. “I guess, he added\ngravely, “what is going to happen is that before I find her husband\nI will have got to know him pretty well.”",
        "Apparently, young Mrs. Ashton believed everything would come to\npass just as Ford promised it would and as he chose to order it;\nfor the next day, with a color not born of fever in her cheeks and\ncourage in her eyes, she joined Ford and the doctor at the\nluncheon-table. Her attention was concentrated on the younger man.\nIn him she saw the one person who could bring her husband to her.",
        "“She acts,” growled the doctor later in the smoking-room, “as\nthough she was afraid you were going to back out of your promise\nand jump overboard.”",
        "“Don’t think,” he protested violently, “it’s you she’s interested\nin. All she sees in you is what you can do for her. Can you see\nthat?”",
        "“Any one as clever at seeing things as I am,” returned the\nreporter, “cannot help but see that.”",
        "Later, as Ford was walking on the upper deck, Mrs. Ashton came\ntoward him, beating her way against the wind. Without a trace of\ncoquetry or self-consciousness, and with a sigh of content, she\nlaid her hand on his arm.",
        "“When I don’t see you,” she exclaimed as simply as a child, “I feel\nso frightened. When I see you I know all will come right. Do you\nmind if I walk with you?” she asked. “And do you mind if every now\nand then I ask you to tell me again it will all come right?”",
        "For the three days following Mrs. Ashton and Ford were constantly\ntogether. Or, at least, Mrs. Ashton was constantly with Ford. She\ntold him that when she sat in her cabin the old fears returned to\nher, and in these moments of panic she searched the ship for him.",
        "The doctor protested that he was growing jealous.",
        "“I’m not so greatly to be envied,” suggested Ford. “’Harry’ at\nmeals three times a day and on deck all the rest of the day becomes\nmonotonous. On a closer acquaintance with Harry he seems to be a\ndecent sort of a young man; at least he seems to have been at one\ntime very much in love with her.”",
        "“Well,” sighed the doctor sentimentally, “she is certainly very\nmuch in love with Harry.”",
        "Ford shook his head non-committingly. “I don’t know her story,” he\nsaid. “Don’t want to know it.”",
        "The ship was in the channel, on her way to Cherbourg, and running\nas smoothly as a clock. From the shore friendly lights told them\nthey were nearing their journey’s end; that the land was on every\nside. Seated on a steamer-chair next to his in the semi-darkness\nof the deck, Mrs. Ashton began to talk nervously and eagerly.",
        "“Now that we are so near,” she murmured, “I have got to tell you\nsomething. If you did not know I would feel I had not been fair.\nYou might think that when you were doing so much for me I should\nhave been more honest.”",
        "She drew a long breath. “It’s so hard,” she said.",
        "“Wait,” commanded Ford. “Is it going to help me to find him?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Then don’t tell me.”",
        "His tone caused the girl to start. She leaned toward him and\npeered into his face. His eyes, as he looked back to her, were\nkind and comprehending.",
        "“You mean,” said the amateur detective, “that your husband has\ndeserted you. That if it were not for the baby you would not try\nto find him. Is that it?”",
        "Mrs. Ashton breathed quickly and turned her face away.",
        "“Yes,” she whispered. “That is it.”",
        "There was a long pause. When she faced him again the fact that\nthere was no longer a secret between them seemed to give her\ncourage.",
        "“Maybe,” she said, “you can understand. Maybe you can tell me what\nit means. I have thought and thought. I have gone over it and\nover it until when I go back to it my head aches. I have done\nnothing else but think, and I can’t make it seem better. I can’t\nfind any excuse. I have had no one to talk to, no one I could\ntell. I have thought maybe a man could understand.” She raised\nher eyes appealingly.",
        "“If you can only make it seem less cruel. Don’t you see,” she\ncried miserably, “I want to believe; I want to forgive him. I want\nto think he loves me. Oh! I want so to be able to love him; but\nhow can I? I can’t!  I can’t!”",
        "In the week in which they had been thrown together the girl\nunconsciously had told Ford much about herself and her husband.\nWhat she now told him was but an amplification of what he had\nguessed.",
        "She had met Ashton a year and a half before, when she had just left\nschool at the convent and had returned to live with her family.\nHer home was at Far Rockaway. Her father was a cashier in a bank\nat Long Island City. One night, with a party of friends, she had\nbeen taken to a dance at one of the beach hotels, and there met\nAshton. At that time he was one of a firm that was making book at\nthe Aqueduct race-track. The girl had met very few men and with\nthem was shy and frightened, but with Ashton she found herself at\nonce at ease. That night he drove her and her friends home in his\ntouring-car and the next day they teased her about her conquest.\nIt made her very happy. After that she went to hops at the hotel,\nand as the bookmaker did not dance, the two young people sat upon\nthe piazza. Then Ashton came to see her at her own house, but when\nher father learned that the young man who had been calling upon her\nwas a bookmaker he told him he could not associate with his\ndaughter.",
        "But the girl was now deeply in love with Ashton, and apparently he\nwith her. He begged her to marry him. They knew that to this,\npartly from prejudice and partly owing to his position in the bank,\nher father would object. Accordingly they agreed that in August,\nwhen the racing moved to Saratoga, they would run away and get\nmarried at that place. Their plan was that Ashton would leave for\nSaratoga with the other racing men, and that she would join him the\nnext day.",
        "They had arranged to be married by a magistrate, and Ashton had\nshown her a letter from one at Saratoga who consented to perform\nthe ceremony. He had given her an engagement ring and two thousand\ndollars, which he asked her to keep for him, lest tempted at the\ntrack he should lose it.",
        "But she assured Ford it was not such material things as a letter, a\nring, or gift of money that had led her to trust Ashton. His fear\nof losing her, his complete subjection to her wishes, his happiness\nin her presence, all seemed to prove that to make her happy was his\none wish, and that he could do anything to make her unhappy\nappeared impossible.",
        "They were married the morning she arrived at Saratoga; and the same\nday departed for Niagara Falls and Quebec. The honeymoon lasted\nten days. They were ten days of complete happiness. No one, so\nthe girl declared, could have been more kind, more unselfishly\nconsiderate than her husband. They returned to Saratoga and\nengaged a suite of rooms at one of the big hotels. Ashton was not\nsatisfied with the rooms shown him, and leaving her upstairs\nreturned to the office floor to ask for others.",
        "Since that moment his wife had never seen him nor heard from him.",
        "On the day of her marriage young Mrs. Ashton had written to her\nfather, asking him to give her his good wishes and pardon. He\nrefused both. As she had feared, he did not consider that for a\nbank clerk a gambler made a desirable son-in-law; and the letters\nhe wrote his daughter were so bitter that in reply she informed him\nhe had forced her to choose between her family and her husband, and\nthat she chose her husband. In consequence, when she found herself\ndeserted she felt she could not return to her people. She remained\nin Saratoga. There she moved into cheap lodgings, and in order\nthat the two thousand dollars Ashton had left with her might be\nsaved for his child, she had learned to type-write, and after four\nmonths had been able to support herself. Within the last month a\ngirl friend, who had known both Ashton and herself before they were\nmarried, had written her that her husband was living in London.\nFor the sake of her son she had at once determined to make an\neffort to seek him out.",
        "“The son, nonsense!” exclaimed the doctor, when Ford retold the\nstory. “She is not crossing the ocean because she is worried about\nthe future of her son. She seeks her own happiness. The woman is\nin love with her husband.”",
        "Ford shook his head.",
        "“I don’t know!” he objected. “She’s so extravagant in her praise\nof Harry that it seems unreal. It sounds insincere. Then, again,\nwhen I swear I will find him she shows a delight that you might\ndescribe as savage, almost vindictive. As though, if I did find\nHarry, the first thing she would do would be to stick a knife in\nhim.”",
        "“Maybe,” volunteered the doctor sadly, “she has heard there is a\nwoman in the case. Maybe she is the one she’s thinking of sticking\nthe knife into?”",
        "“Well,” declared the reporter, “if she doesn’t stop looking savage\nevery time I promise to find Harry I won’t find Harry. Why should\nI act the part of Fate, anyway? How do I know that Harry hasn’t\ngot a wife in London and several in the States? How do we know he\ndidn’t leave his country for his country’s good? That’s what it\nlooks like to me. How can we tell what confronted him the day he\nwent down to the hotel desk to change his rooms and, instead, got\ninto his touring-car and beat the speed limit to Canada. Whom did\nhe meet in the hotel corridor? A woman with a perfectly good\nmarriage certificate, or a detective with a perfectly good warrant?\nOr did Harry find out that his bride had a devil of a temper of her\nown, and that for him marriage was a failure? The widow is\ncertainly a very charming young woman, but there may be two sides\nto this.”",
        "“You are a cynic, sir,” protested the doctor.",
        "“That may be,” growled the reporter, “but I am not a private\ndetective agency, or a matrimonial bureau, and before I hear myself\nsaying, ’Bless you, my children!’ both of these young people will\nhave to show me why they should not be kept asunder.”",
