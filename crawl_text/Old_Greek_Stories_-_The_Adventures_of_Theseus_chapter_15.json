        "There was once a king of Athens whose name was AEgeus. He had no son; but\nhe had fifty nephews, and they were waiting for him to die, so that one\nof them might be king in his stead. They were wild, worthless fellows,\nand the people of Athens looked forward with dread to the day when the\ncity should be in their power. Yet so long as AEgeus lived they could not\ndo much harm, but were content to spend their time in eating and\ndrinking at the king’s table and in quarreling among themselves.",
        "It so happened one summer that AEgeus left his kingdom in the care of the\nelders of the city and went on a voyage across the Saronic Sea to the\nold and famous city of Troezen, which lay nestled at the foot of the\nmountains on the opposite shore. Troezen was not fifty miles by water\nfrom Athens, and the purple-peaked island of AEgina lay between them;\nbut to the people of that early time the distance seemed very great, and\nit was not often that ships passed from one place to the other. And as\nfor going by land round the great bend of the sea, that was a thing so\nfraught with danger that no man had ever dared try it.",
        "King Pittheus of Troezen was right glad to see AEgeus, for they had been\nboys together, and he welcomed him to his city and did all that he could\nto make his visit a pleasant one. So, day after day, there was feasting\nand merriment and music in the marble halls of old Troezen, and the two\nkings spent many a happy hour in talking of the deeds of their youth and\nof the mighty heroes whom both had known. And when the time came for the\nship to sail back to Athens, AEgeus was not ready to go. He said he would\nstay yet a little longer in Troezen, for that the elders of the city\nwould manage things well at home; and so the ship returned without him.",
        "But AEgeus tarried, not so much for the rest and enjoyment which he was\nhaving in the home of his old friend, as for the sake of AEthra, his old\nfriend’s daughter. For AEthra was as fair as a summer morning, and she\nwas the joy and pride of Troezen; and AEgeus was never so happy as when\nin her presence. So it happened that some time after the ship had\nsailed, there was a wedding in the halls of King Pittheus; but it was\nkept a secret, for AEgeus feared that his nephews, if they heard of it,\nwould be very angry and would send men to Troezen to do him harm.",
        "Month after month passed by, and still AEgeus lingered with his bride and\ntrusted his elders to see to the affairs of Athens. Then one morning,\nwhen the gardens of Troezen were full of roses and the heather was green\non the hills, a babe was born to AEthra–a boy with a fair face and\nstrong arms and eyes as sharp and as bright as the mountain eagle’s. And\nnow AEgeus was more loth to return home than he had been before, and he\nwent up on the mountain which overlooks Troezen, and prayed to Athena,\nthe queen of the air, to give him wisdom and show him what to do. Even\nwhile he prayed there came a ship into the harbor, bringing a letter to\nAEgeus and alarming news from Athens.",
        "“Come home without delay\"–these were words of the letter which the\nelders had sent–\"come home quickly, or Athens will be lost. A great\nking from beyond the sea, Minos of Crete, is on the way with ships and a\nhost of fighting men; and he declares that he will carry sword and fire\nwithin our walls, and will slay our young men and make our children his\nslaves. Come and save us!”",
        "“It is the call of duty,” said AEgeus; and with a heavy heart he made\nready to go at once across the sea to the help of his people. But he\ncould not take AEthra and her babe, for fear of his lawless nephews, who\nwould have slain them both.",
        "“Best of wives,” he said, when the hour for parting had come, “listen to\nme, for I shall never see your father’s halls, nor dear old Troezen, nor\nperhaps your own fair face, again. Do you remember the old plane tree\nwhich stands on the mountain side, and the great flat stone which lies a\nlittle way beyond it, and which no man but myself has ever been able to\nlift? Under that stone, I have hidden my sword and the sandals which I\nbrought from Athens. There they shall lie until our child is strong\nenough to lift the stone and take them for his own. Care for him, AEthra,\nuntil that time; and then, and not till then, you may tell him of his\nfather, and bid him seek me in Athens.”",
        "Then AEgeus kissed his wife and the babe, and went on board the ship; the\nsailors shouted; the oars were dipped into the waves; the white sail was\nspread to the breeze; and AEthra from her palace window saw the vessel\nspeed away over the blue waters towards AEgina and the distant Attic\nshore.",
        "Year after year went by, and yet no word reached AEthra from her husband\non the other side of the sea. Often and often she would climb the\nmountain above Troezen, and sit there all day, looking out over the blue\nwaters and the purple hills of AEgina to the dim, distant shore beyond.\nNow and then she could see a white-winged ship sailing in the offing;\nbut men said that it was a Cretan vessel, and very likely was filled\nwith fierce Cretan warriors, bound upon some cruel errand of war. Then\nit was rumored that King Minos had seized upon all the ships of Athens,\nand had burned a part of the city, and had forced the people to pay him\na most grievous tribute. But further than this there was no news.",
        "In the meanwhile AEthra’s babe had grown to be a tall, ruddy-cheeked lad,\nstrong as a mountain lion; and she had named him Theseus. On the day\nthat he was fifteen years old he went with her up to the top of the\nmountain, and with her looked out over the sea.",
        "“Ah, if only your father would come!” she sighed.",
        "“My father?” said Theseus. “Who is my father, and why are you always\nwatching and waiting and wishing that he would come? Tell me about him.”",
        "And she answered: “My child, do you see the great flat stone which lies\nthere, half buried in the ground, and covered with moss and trailing\nivy? Do you think you can lift it?”",
        "“I will try, mother,” said Theseus. And he dug his fingers into the\nground beside it, and grasped its uneven edges, and tugged and lifted\nand strained until his breath came hard and his arms ached and his body\nwas covered with sweat; but the stone was moved not at all. At last he\nsaid, “The task is too hard for me until I have grown stronger. But why\ndo you wish me to lift it?”",
        "“When you are strong enough to lift it,” answered AEthra, “I will tell\nyou about your father.”",
        "After that the boy went out every day and practiced at running and\nleaping and throwing and lifting; and every day he rolled some stone out\nof its place. At first he could move only a little weight, and those who\nsaw him laughed as he pulled and puffed and grew red in the face, but\nnever gave up until he had lifted it. And little by little he grew\nstronger, and his muscles became like iron bands, and his limbs were\nlike mighty levers for strength. Then on his next birthday he went up on\nthe mountain with his mother, and again tried to lift the great stone.\nBut it remained fast in its place and was not moved.",
        "“I am not yet strong enough, mother,” he said.",
        "“Have patience, my son,” said AEthra.",
        "So he went on again with his running and leaping and throwing and\nlifting; and he practiced wrestling, also, and tamed the wild horses of\nthe plain, and hunted the lions among the mountains; and his strength\nand swiftness and skill were the wonder of all men, and old Troezen was\nfilled with tales of the deeds of the boy Theseus. Yet when he tried\nagain on his seventeenth birthday, he could not move the great flat\nstone that lay near the plane tree on the mountain side.",
        "“Have patience, my son,” again said AEthra; but this time the tears were\nstanding in her eyes.",
        "So he went back again to his exercising; and he learned to wield the\nsword and the battle ax and to throw tremendous weights and to carry\ntremendous burdens. And men said that since the days of Hercules there\nwas never so great strength in one body. Then, when he was a year older,\nhe climbed the mountain yet another time with his mother, and he stooped\nand took hold of the stone, and it yielded to his touch; and, lo, when\nhe had lifted it quite out of the ground, he found underneath it a sword\nof bronze and sandals of gold, and these he gave to his mother.",
        "“Tell me now about my father,” he said.",
        "AEthra knew that the time had come for which she had waited so long, and\nshe buckled the sword to his belt and fastened the sandals upon his\nfeet. Then she told him who his father was, and why he had left them in\nTroezen, ands how he had said that when the lad was strong enough to\nlift the great stone, he must take the sword and sandals and go and seek\nhim in Athens.",
        "Theseus was glad when he heard this, and his proud eyes flashed with\neagerness as he said: “I am ready, mother; and I will set out for Athens\nthis very day.”",
        "Then they walked down the mountain together and told King Pittheus what\nhad happened, and showed him the sword and the sandals. But the old man\nshook his head sadly and tried to dissuade Theseus from going.",
        "“How can you go to Athens in these lawless times?” he said. “The sea is\nfull of pirates. In fact, no ship from Troezen has sailed across the\nSaronic Sea since your kingly father went home to the help of his\npeople, eighteen years ago.”",
        "Then, finding that this only made Theseus the more determined, he said:\n“But if you must go, I will have a new ship built for you, stanch and\nstout and fast sailing; and fifty of the bravest young men in Troezen\nshall go with you; and mayhap with fair winds and fearless hearts you\nshall escape the pirates and reach Athens in safety.”",
        "“Which is the most perilous way?” asked Theseus–\"to go by ship or to\nmake the journey on foot round the great bend of land?”",
        "“The seaway is full enough of perils,” said his grandfather, “but the\nlandway is beset with dangers tenfold greater. Even if there were good\nroads and no hindrances, the journey round the shore is a long one and\nwould require many days. But there are rugged mountains to climb, and\nwide marshes to cross, and dark forests to go through. There is hardly a\nfootpath in all that wild region, nor any place to find rest or shelter;\nand the woods are full of wild beasts, and dreadful dragons lurk in the\nmarshes, and many cruel robber giants dwell in the mountains.”",
        "“Well,” said Theseus, “if there are more perils by land than by sea,\nthen I shall go by land, and I go at once.”",
        "“But you will at least take fifty young men, your companions, with you?\"\nsaid King Pittheus.",
        "“Not one shall go with me,” said Theseus; and he stood up and played\nwith his sword hilt, and laughed at the thought of fear.",
        "Then when there was nothing more to say, he kissed his mother and bade\nhis grandfather good-by, and went out of Troezen towards the trackless\ncoastland which lay to the west and north. And with blessings and tears\nthe king and AEthra followed him to the city gates, and watched him until\nhis tall form was lost to sight among the trees which bordered the shore\nof the sea.",
        "With a brave heart Theseus walked on, keeping the sea always upon his\nright. Soon the old city of Troezen was left far behind, and he came to\nthe great marshes, where the ground sank under him at every step, and\ngreen pools of stagnant water lay on both sides of the narrow pathway.\nBut no fiery dragon came out of the reeds to meet him; and so he walked\non and on till he came to the rugged mountain land which bordered the\nwestern shore of the sea. Then he climbed one slope after another, until\nat last he stood on the summit of a gray peak from which he could see\nthe whole country spread out around him. Then downward and onward he\nwent again, but his way led him through dark mountain glens, and along\nthe edges of mighty precipices, and underneath many a frowning cliff,\nuntil he came to a dreary wood where the trees grew tall and close\ntogether and the light of the sun was seldom seen.",
        "In that forest there dwelt a robber giant, called Club-carrier, who was\nthe terror of all the country. For oftentimes he would go down into the\nvalleys where the shepherds fed their flocks, and would carry off not\nonly sheep and lambs, but sometimes children and the men themselves. It\nwas his custom to hide in the thickets of underbrush, close to a\npathway, and, when a traveler passed that way, leap out upon him and\nbeat him to death. When he saw Theseus coming through the woods, he\nthought that he would have a rich prize, for he knew from the youth’s\ndress and manner that he must be a prince. He lay on the ground, where\nleaves of ivy and tall grass screened him from view, and held his great\niron club ready to strike.",
        "But Theseus had sharp eyes and quick ears, and neither beast nor robber\ngiant could have taken him by surprise. When Club-carrier leaped out of\nhis hiding place to strike him down, the young man dodged aside so\nquickly that the heavy club struck the ground behind him; and then,\nbefore the robber giant could raise it for a second stroke, Theseus\nseized the fellow’s legs and tripped him up.",
        "Club-carrier roared loudly, and tried to strike again; but Theseus\nwrenched the club out of his hands, and then dealt him such a blow on\nthe head that he never again harmed travelers passing through the\nforest. Then the youth went on his way, carrying the huge club on his\nshoulder, and singing a song of victory, and looking sharply around him\nfor any other foes that might be lurking among the trees.",
        "Just over the ridge of the next mountain he met an old man who warned\nhim not to go any farther. He said that close by a grove of pine trees,\nwhich he would soon pass on his way down the slope, there dwelt a robber\nnamed Sinis, who was very cruel to strangers.",
        "“He is called Pine-bender,” said the old man; “for when he has caught a\ntraveler, he bends two tall, lithe pine trees to the ground and binds\nhis captive to them–a hand and a foot to the top of one, and a hand and\na foot to the top of the other. Then he lets the trees fly up, and he\nroars with laughter when he sees the traveler’s body torn in sunder.”",
        "“It seems to me,” said Theseus, “that it is full time to rid the world\nof such a monster;” and he thanked the kind man who had warned him, and\nhastened onward, whistling merrily as he went down towards the grove of\npines.",
        "Soon he came in sight of the robber’s house, built near the foot of a\njutting cliff. Behind it was a rocky gorge and a roaring mountain\nstream; and in front of it was a garden wherein grew all kinds of rare\nplants and beautiful flowers. But the tops of the pine trees below it\nwere laden with the bones of unlucky travelers, which hung bleaching\nwhite in the sun and wind.",
        "On a stone by the roadside sat Sinis himself; and when he saw Theseus\ncoming, he ran to meet him, twirling a long rope in his hands and crying\nout:",
        "“Welcome, welcome, dear prince! Welcome to our inn–the true Traveler’s\nRest!”",
        "“What kind of entertainment have you?” asked Theseus. “Have you a pine\ntree bent down to the ground and ready for me?”",
        "“Ay; two of them!” said the robber. “I knew that you were coming, and I\nbent two of them for you.”",
        "As he spoke he threw his rope towards Theseus and tried to entangle him\nin its coils. But the young man leaped aside, and when the robber rushed\nupon him, he dodged beneath his hands and seized his legs, as he had\nseized Club-carrier’s, and threw him heavily to the ground. Then the two\nwrestled together among the trees, but not long, for Sinis was no match\nfor his lithe young foe; and Theseus knelt upon the robber’s back as he\nlay prone among the leaves, and tied him with his own cord to the two\npine trees which were already bent down. “As you would have done unto\nme, so will I do unto you,” he said.",
        "Then Pine-bender wept and prayed and made many a fair promise; but\nTheseus would not hear him. He turned away, the trees sprang up, and the\nrobber’s body was left dangling from their branches.",
        "Now this old Pine-bender had a daughter named Perigune, who was no more\nlike him than a fair and tender violet is like the gnarled old oak at\nwhose feet it nestles; and it was she who cared for the flowers and the\nrare plants which grew in the garden by the robber’s house. When she saw\nhow Theseus had dealt with her father, she was afraid and ran to hide\nherself from him.",
        "“Oh, save me, dear plants!” she cried, for she often talked to the\nflowers as though they could understand her. “Dear plants, save me; and\nI will never pluck your leaves nor harm you in any way so long as I\nlive.”",
        "There was one of the plants which up to that time had had no leaves, but\ncame up out of the ground looking like a mere club or stick. This plant\ntook pity on the maiden. It began at once to send out long feathery\nbranches with delicate green leaves, which grew so fast that Perigune\nwas soon hidden from sight beneath them. Theseus knew that she must be\nsomewhere in the garden, but he could not find her, so well did the\nfeathery branches conceal her. So he called to her:",
        "“Perigune,” he said, “you need not fear me; for I know that you are\ngentle and good, and it is only against things dark and cruel that I\nlift up my hand.”",
        "The maiden peeped from her hiding-place, and when she saw the fair face\nof the youth and heard his kind voice, she came out, trembling, and\ntalked with him. And Theseus rested that evening in her house, and she\npicked some of her choicest flowers for him and gave him food. But when\nin the morning the dawn began to appear in the east, and the stars grew\ndim above the mountain peaks, he bade her farewell and journeyed onward\nover the hills. And Perigune tended her plants and watched her flowers\nin the lone garden in the midst of the piny grove; but she never plucked\nthe stalks of asparagus nor used them for food, and when she afterwards\nbecame the wife of a hero and had children and grandchildren and\ngreat-grandchildren, she taught them all to spare the plant which had\ntaken pity upon her in her need.",
        "The road which Theseus followed now led him closer to the shore, and by\nand by he came to a place where the mountains seemed to rise sheer out\nof the sea, and there was only a, narrow path high up along the side of\nthe cliff. Far down beneath his feet he could hear the waves dashing\nevermore against the rocky wall, while above him the mountain eagles\ncircled and screamed, and gray crags and barren peaks glistened in the\nsunlight.",
        "But Theseus went on fearlessly and came at last to a place where a\nspring of clear water bubbled out from a cleft in the rock; and there\nthe path was narrower still, and the low doorway of a cavern opened out\nupon it. Close by the spring sat a red-faced giant, with a huge club\nacross his knees, guarding the road so that no one could pass; and in\nthe sea at the foot of the cliff basked a huge turtle, its leaden eyes\nlooking always upward for its food. Theseus knew–for Perigune had told\nhim–that this was the dwelling-place of a robber named Sciron, who was\nthe terror of all the coast, and whose custom it was to make strangers\nwash his feet, so that while they were doing so, he might kick them over\nthe cliff to be eaten, by his pet turtle below.",
        "When Theseus came up, the robber raised his club, and said fiercely: “No\nman can pass here until he has washed my feet! Come, set to work!”",
        "Then Theseus smiled, and said: “Is your turtle hungry to-day? and do you\nwant me to feed him?” The robber’s eyes flashed fire, and he said, “You\nshall feed him, but you shall wash my feet first;” and with that he\nbrandished his club in the air and rushed forward to strike.",
        "But Theseus was ready for him. With the iron club which he had taken\nfrom Club-carrier in the forest he met the blow midway, and the robber’s\nweapon was knocked out of his hands and sent spinning away over the edge\nof the cliff. Then Sciron, black with rage, tried to grapple with him;\nbut Theseus was too quick for that. He dropped his club and seized\nSciron by the throat; he pushed him back against the ledge on which he\nhad been sitting; he threw him sprawling upon the sharp rocks, and held\nhim there, hanging half way over the cliff.",
        "“Enough! enough!” cried the robber. “Let me up, and you may pass on your\nway.”",
        "“It is not enough,” said Theseus; and he drew his sword and sat down by\nthe side of the spring. “You must wash my feet now. Come, set to work!”",
        "Then Sciron, white with fear, washed his feet.",
        "“And now,” said Theseus, when the task was ended, “as you have done unto\nothers, so will I do unto you.”",
        "There was a scream in mid air which the mountain eagles answered from\nabove; there was a great splashing in the water below, and the turtle\nfled in terror from its lurking place. Then the sea cried out: “I will\nhave naught to do with so vile a wretch!” and a great wave cast the body\nof Sciron out upon the shore. But it had no sooner touched the ground\nthan the land cried out: “I will have naught to do with so vile a\nwretch!” and there was a sudden earthquake, and the body of Sciron was\nthrown back into the sea. Then the sea waxed furious, a raging storm\narose, the waters were lashed into foam, and the waves with one mighty\neffort threw the detested body high into the air; and there it would\nhave hung unto this day had not the air itself disdained to give it\nlodging and changed it into a huge black rock. And this rock, which men\nsay is the body of Sciron, may still be seen, grim, ugly, and desolate;\nand one third of it lies in the sea, one third is embedded in the sandy\nshore, and one third is exposed to the air.",
        "Keeping the sea always in view, Theseus went onward a long day’s journey\nto the north and east; and he left the rugged mountains behind and came\ndown into the valleys and into a pleasant plain where there were sheep\nand cattle pasturing and where there were many fields of ripening\ngrain. The fame of his deeds had gone before him, and men and women\ncame crowding to the roadside to see the hero who had slain Club-carrier\nand Pine-bender and grim old Sciron of the cliff.",
        "“Now we shall live in peace,” they cried; “for the robbers who devoured\nour flocks and our children are no more.”",
        "Then Theseus passed through the old town of Megara, and followed the\nshore of the bay towards the sacred city of Eleusis.",
        "“Do not go into Eleusis, but take the road which leads round it through\nthe hills,” whispered a poor man who was carrying a sheep to market.",
        "“Why shall I do that?” asked Theseus.",
        "“Listen, and I will tell you,” was the answer. “There is a king in\nEleusis whose name is Cercyon, and he is a great wrestler. He makes\nevery stranger who comes into the city wrestle with him; and such is the\nstrength of his arms that when he has overcome a man he crushes the life\nout of his body. Many travelers come to Eleusis, but no one ever goes\naway.”",
        "“But I will both come and go away,” said Theseus; and with his club upon\nhis shoulder, he strode onward into the sacred city.",
        "“Where is Cercyon, the wrestler?” he asked of the warden at the gate.",
        "“The king is dining in his marble palace,” was the answer. “If you wish\nto save yourself, turn now and flee before he has heard of your coming.”",
        "“Why should I flee?” asked Theseus. “I am not afraid;” and he walked on\nthrough the narrow street to old Cercyon’s palace.",
        "The king was sitting at his table, eating and drinking; and he grinned\nhideously as he thought of the many noble young men whose lives he had\ndestroyed. Theseus went up boldly to the door, and cried out:",
        "“Cercyon, come out and wrestle with me!”",
        "“Ah!” said the king, “here comes another young fool whose days are\nnumbered. Fetch him in and let him dine with me; and after that he shall\nhave his fill of wrestling.”",
        "So Theseus was given a place at the table of the king, and the two sat\nthere and ate and stared at each other, but spoke not a word. And\nCercyon, as he looked at the young man’s sharp eyes and his fair face\nand silken hair, had half a mind to bid him go in peace and seek not to\ntest his strength and skill. But when they had finished, Theseus arose\nand laid aside his sword and his sandals and his iron club, and stripped\nhimself of his robes, and said:",
        "“Come now, Cercyon, if you are not afraid; come, and wrestle with me.”",
        "Then the two went out into the courtyard where many a young man had met\nhis fate, and there they wrestled until the sun went down, and neither\ncould gain aught of advantage over the other. But it was plain that the\ntrained skill of Theseus would, in the end, win against the brute\nstrength of Cercyon. Then the men of Eleusis who stood watching the\ncontest, saw the youth lift the giant king bodily into the air and hurl\nhim headlong over his shoulder to the hard pavement beyond.",
        "“As you have done to others, so will I do unto you!” cried Theseus.",
        "But grim old Cercyon neither moved nor spoke; and when the youth turned\nhis body over and looked into his cruel face, he saw that the life had\nquite gone out of him.",
        "Then the people of Eleusis came to Theseus and wanted to make him their\nking. “You have slain the tyrant who was the bane of Eleusis,” they\nsaid, “and we have heard how you have also rid the world of the giant\nrobbers who were the terror of the land. Come now and be our king; for\nwe know that you will rule over us wisely and well.”",
        "“Some day,” said Theseus, “I will be your king, but not now; for there\nare other deeds for me to do.” And with that he donned his sword and\nhis sandals and his princely cloak, and threw his great iron club upon\nhis shoulder, and went out of Eleusis; and all the people ran after him\nfor quite a little way, shouting, “May good fortune be with you, O king,\nand may Athena bless and guide you!”",
        "Athens was now not more than twenty miles away, but the road thither led\nthrough the Parnes Mountains, and was only a narrow path winding among\nthe rocks and up and down many a lonely wooded glen. Theseus had seen\nworse and far more dangerous roads than this, and so he strode bravely\nonward, happy in the thought that he was so near the end of his long\njourney. But it was very slow traveling among the mountains, and he was\nnot always sure that he was following the right path. The sun was almost\ndown when he came to a broad green valley where the trees had been\ncleared away. A little river flowed through the middle of this valley,\nand on either side were grassy meadows where cattle were grazing; and on\na hillside close by, half hidden among the trees, there was a great\nstone house with vines running over its walls and roof.",
        "While Theseus was wondering who it could be that lived in this pretty\nbut lonely place, a man came out of the house and hurried down to the\nroad to meet him. He was a well-dressed man, and his face was wreathed\nwith smiles; and he bowed low to Theseus and invited him kindly to come\nup to the house and be his guest that night.",
        "“This is a lonely place,” he said, “and it is not often that travelers\npass this way. But there is nothing that gives me so much joy as to find\nstrangers and feast them at my table and hear them tell of the things\nthey have seen and heard. Come up, and sup with me, and lodge under my\nroof; and you shall sleep on a wonderful bed which I have–a bed which\nfits every guest and cures him of every ill.”",
        "Theseus was pleased with the man’s ways, and as he was both hungry and\ntired, he went up with him and sat down under the vines by the door; and\nthe man said:",
        "“Now I will go in and make the bed ready for you, and you can lie down\nupon it and rest; and later, when you feel refreshed, you shall sit at\nmy table and sup with me, and I will listen to the pleasant tales which\nI know you will tell.”",
        "When he had gone into the house, Theseus looked around him to see what\nsort of a place it was. He was filled with surprise at the richness of\nit–at the gold and silver and beautiful things with which every room\nseemed to be adorned–for it was indeed a place fit for a prince. While\nhe was looking and wondering, the vines before him were parted and the\nfair face of a young girl peeped out.",
        "“Noble stranger,” she whispered, “do not lie down on my master’s bed,\nfor those who do so never rise again. Fly down the glen and hide\nyourself in the deep woods ere he returns, or else there will be no\nescape for you.”",
        "“Who is your master, fair maiden, that I should be afraid of him?” asked\nTheseus.",
        "“Men call him Procrustes, or the Stretcher,” said the girl–and she\ntalked low and fast. “He is a robber. He brings hither all the strangers\nthat he finds traveling through the mountains. He puts them on his iron\nbed. He robs them of all they have. No one who comes into his house ever\ngoes out again.”",
        "“Why do they call him the Stretcher? And what is that iron bed of his?\"\nasked Theseus, in no wise alarmed.",
        "“Did he not tell you that it fits all guests?” said the girl; “and most\ntruly it does fit them. For if a traveler is too long, Procrustes hews\noff his legs until he is of the right length; but if he is too short, as\nis the case with most guests, then he stretches his limbs and body with\nropes until he is long enough. It is for this reason that men call him\nthe Stretcher.”",
        "“Methinks that I have heard of this Stretcher before,” said Theseus; and\nthen he remembered that some one at Eleusis had warned him to beware of\nthe wily robber, Procrustes, who lurked in the glens of the Parnes peaks\nand lured travelers into his den.",
        "“Hark! hark!” whispered the girl. “I hear him coming!” And the vine\nleaves closed over her hiding-place.",
        "The very next moment Procrustes stood in the door, bowing and smiling as\nthough he had never done any harm to his fellow men.",
        "“My dear young friend,” he said, “the bed is ready, and I will show you\nthe way. After you have taken a pleasant little nap, we will sit down at\ntable, and you may tell me of the wonderful things which you have seen\nin the course of your travels.”",
        "Theseus arose and followed his host; and when they had come into an\ninner chamber, there, surely enough, was the bedstead, of iron, very\ncuriously wrought, and upon it a soft couch which seemed to invite him\nto lie down and rest. But Theseus, peering about, saw the ax and the\nropes with cunning pulleys lying hidden behind the curtains; and he saw,\ntoo, that the floor was covered with stains of blood.",
        "“Now, my dear young friend,” said Procrustes, “I pray you to lie down\nand take your ease; for I know that you have traveled far and are faint\nfrom want of rest and sleep. Lie down, and while sweet slumber overtakes\nyou, I will have a care that no unseemly noise, nor buzzing fly, nor\nvexing gnat disturbs your dreams.”",
        "“Is this your wonderful bed?” asked Theseus.",
        "“It is,” answered Procrustes, “and you need but to lie down upon it, and\nit will fit you perfectly.”",
        "“But you must lie upon it first,” said Theseus, “and let me see how it\nwill fit itself to your stature.”",
        "“Ah, no,” said Procrustes, “for then the spell would be broken,” and as\nhe spoke his cheeks grew ashy pale.",
        "“But I tell you, you must lie upon it,” said Theseus; and he seized the\ntrembling man around the waist and threw him by force upon the bed. And\nno sooner was he prone upon the couch than curious iron arms reached out\nand clasped his body in their embrace and held him down so that he could\nnot move hand or foot. The wretched man shrieked and cried for mercy;\nbut Theseus stood over him and looked him straight in the eye.",
        "“Is this the kind of bed on which you have your guests lie down?” he\nasked.",
        "But Procrustes answered not a word. Then Theseus brought out the ax and\nthe ropes and the pulleys, and asked him what they were for, and why\nthey were hidden in the chamber. He was still silent, and could do\nnothing now but tremble and weep.",
        "“Is it true,” said Theseus, “that you have lured hundreds of travelers\ninto your den only to rob them? Is it true that it is your wont to\nfasten them in this bed, and then chop off their legs or stretch them\nout until they fit the iron frame? Tell me, is this true?”",
        "“It is true! it is true!” sobbed Procrustes; “and now kindly touch the\nspring above my head and let me go, and you shall have everything that I\npossess.”",
        "But Theseus turned away. “You are caught,” he said, “in the trap which\nyou set for others and for me. There is no mercy for the man who shows\nno mercy;” and he went out of the room, and left the wretch to perish by\nhis own cruel device.",
        "Theseus looked through the house and found there great wealth of gold\nand silver and costly things which Procrustes had taken from the\nstrangers who had fallen into his hands. He went into the dining hall,\nand there indeed was the table spread with a rich feast of meats and\ndrinks and delicacies such as no king would scorn; but there was a seat\nand a plate for only the host, and none at all for guests.",
        "Then the girl whose fair face Theseus had seen among the vines, came\nrunning into the house; and she seized the young hero’s hands and\nblessed and thanked him because he had rid the world of the cruel\nProcrustes.",
        "“Only a month ago,” she said, “my father, a rich merchant of Athens, was\ntraveling towards Eleusis, and I was with him, happy and care-free as\nany bird in the green woods. This robber lured us into his den, for we\nhad much gold with us. My father, he stretched upon his iron bed; but\nme, he made his slave.”",
        "Then Theseus called together all the inmates of the house, poor wretches\nwhom Procrustes had forced to serve him; and he parted the robber’s\nspoils among them and told them that they were free to go wheresoever\nthey wished. And on the next day he went on, through the narrow crooked\nways among the mountains and hills, and came at last to the plain of\nAthens, and saw the noble city and, in its midst, the rocky height where\nthe great Temple of Athena stood; and, a little way from the temple, he\nsaw the white walls of the palace of the king.",
        "When Theseus entered the city and went walking up the street everybody\nwondered who the tall, fair youth could be. But the fame of his deeds\nhad gone before him, and soon it was whispered that this was the hero\nwho had slain the robbers in the mountains and had wrestled with Cercyon\nat Eleusis and had caught Procrustes in his own cunning trap.",
        "“Tell us no such thing!” said some butchers who were driving their\nloaded carts to market. “The lad is better suited to sing sweet songs to\nthe ladies than to fight robbers and wrestle with giants.”",
        "“See his silken black hair!” said one.",
        "“And his girlish face!” said another.",
        "“And his long coat dangling about his legs!” said a third.",
        "“And his golden sandals!” said a fourth.",
        "“Ha! ha!” laughed the first; “I wager that he never lifted a ten-pound\nweight in his life. Think of such a fellow as he hurling old Sciron from\nthe cliffs! Nonsense!”",
        "Theseus heard all this talk as he strode along, and it angered him not a\nlittle; but he had not come to Athens to quarrel with butchers. Without\nspeaking a word he walked straight up to the foremost cart, and, before\nits driver had time to think, took hold of the slaughtered ox that was\nbeing hauled to market, and hurled it high over the tops of the houses\ninto the garden beyond. Then he did likewise with the oxen in the\nsecond, the third, and the fourth wagons, and, turning about, went on\nhis way, and left the wonder-stricken butchers staring after him,\nspeechless, in the street.",
        "He climbed the stairway which led to the top of the steep, rocky hill,\nand his heart beat fast in his bosom as he stood on the threshold of his\nfather’s palace.",
        "“Where is the king?” he asked of the guard.",
        "“You cannot see the king,” was the answer; “but I will take you to his\nnephews.”",
        "The man led the way into the feast hall, and there Theseus saw his fifty\ncousins sitting about the table, and eating and drinking and making\nmerry; and there was a great noise of revelry in the hall, the minstrels\nsinging and playing, and the slave girls dancing, and the half-drunken\nprinces shouting and cursing. As Theseus stood in the doorway, knitting\nhis eyebrows and clinching his teeth for the anger which he felt, one of\nthe feasters saw him, and cried out:",
        "“See the tall fellow in the doorway! What does he want here?”",
        "“Yes, girl-faced stranger,” said another, “what do you want here?”",
        "“I am here,” said Theseus, “to ask that hospitality which men of our\nrace never refuse to give.”",
        "“Nor do we refuse,” cried they. “Come in, and eat and drink and be our\nguest.”",
        "“I will come in,” said Theseus, “but I will be the guest of the king.\nWhere is he?”",
        "“Never mind the king,” said one of his cousins. “He is taking his ease,\nand we reign in his stead.”",
        "But Theseus strode boldly through the feast hall and went about the\npalace asking for the king. At last he found AEgeus, lonely and\nsorrowful, sitting in an inner chamber. The heart of Theseus was very\nsad as he saw the lines of care upon the old man’s face, and marked his\ntrembling, halting ways.",
        "“Great king,” he said, “I am a stranger in Athens, and I have come to\nyou to ask food and shelter and friendship such as I know you never deny\nto those of noble rank and of your own race.”",
        "“And who are you, young man?” said the king.",
        "“I am Theseus,” was the answer.",
        "“What? the Theseus who has rid the world of the mountain robbers, and of\nCercyon the wrestler, and of Procrustes, the pitiless Stretcher?”",
        "“I am he,” said Theseus; “and I come from old Troezen, on the other side\nof the Saronic Sea.”",
        "The king started and turned very pale.",
        "“Troezen! Troezen!” he cried. Then checking himself, he said, “Yes! yes!\nYou are welcome, brave stranger, to such shelter and food and friendship\nas the King of Athens can give.”",
        "Now it so happened that there was with the king a fair but wicked witch\nnamed Medea, who had so much power over him that he never dared to do\nanything without asking her leave. So he turned to her, and said: “Am I\nnot right, Medea, in bidding this young hero welcome?”",
        "“You are right, King AEgeus,” she said; “and let him be shown at once to\nyour guest chamber, that he may rest himself and afterwards dine with us\nat your own table.”",
        "Medea had learned by her magic arts who Theseus was, and she was not at\nall pleased to have him in Athens; for she feared that when he should\nmake himself known to the king, her own power would be at an end. So,\nwhile Theseus was resting himself in the guest chamber, she told AEgeus\nthat the young stranger was no hero at all, but a man whom his nephews\nhad hired to kill him, for they had grown tired of waiting for him to\ndie. The poor old king was filled with fear, for he believed her words;\nand he asked her what he should do to save his life.",
        "“Let me manage it,” she said. “The young man will soon come down to\ndine with us. I will drop poison into a glass of wine, and at the end of\nthe meal I will give it to him. Nothing can be easier.”",
        "So, when the hour came, Theseus sat down to dine with the king and\nMedea; and while he ate he told of his deeds and of how he had overcome\nthe robber giants, and Cercyon the wrestler, and Procrustes the\npitiless; and as the king listened, his heart yearned strangely towards\nthe young man, and he longed to save him from Medea’s poisoned cup. Then\nTheseus paused in his talk to help himself to a piece of the roasted\nmeat, and, as was the custom of the time, drew his sword to carve\nit–for you must remember that all these things happened long ago,\nbefore people had learned to use knives and forks at the table. As the\nsword flashed from its scabbard, AEgeus saw the letters that were\nengraved upon it–the initials of his own name. He knew at once that it\nwas the sword which he had hidden so many years before under the stone\non the mountain side above Troezen.",
        "“My son! my son!” he cried; and he sprang up and dashed the cup of\npoisoned wine from the table, and flung his arms around Theseus. It was\nindeed a glad meeting for both father and son, and they had many things\nto ask and to tell. As for the wicked Medea, she knew that her day of\nrule was past. She ran out of the palace, and whistled a loud, shrill\ncall; and men say that a chariot drawn by dragons came rushing through\nthe air, and that she leaped into it and was carried away, and no one\never saw her again.",
        "The very next morning, AEgeus sent out his heralds, to make it known\nthrough all the city that Theseus was his son, and that he would in time\nbe king in his stead. When the fifty nephews heard this, they were angry\nand alarmed.",
        "“Shall this upstart cheat us out of our heritage?” they cried; and they\nmade a plot to waylay and kill Theseus in a grove close by the city\ngate.",
        "Right cunningly did the wicked fellows lay their trap to catch the young\nhero; and one morning, as he was passing that way alone, several of them\nfell suddenly upon him, with swords and lances, and tried to slay him\noutright. They were thirty to one, but he faced them boldly and held\nthem at bay, while he shouted for help. The men of Athens, who had borne\nso many wrongs from the hands of the nephews, came running out from the\nstreets; and in the fight which followed, every one of the plotters, who\nhad lain in ambush was slain; and the other nephews, when they heard\nabout it, fled from the city in haste and never came back again.",
