        "Monday, Feb. 1st.  After having been in port twenty-one days,\nwe sailed for San Pedro, where we arrived on the following day,\nhaving gone “all fluking,” with the weather clew of the mainsail\nhauled up, the yards braced in a little, and the lower studding-sails\njust drawing; the wind hardly shifting a point during the passage. \nHere we found the Ayacucho and the Pilgrim, which last we had not\nseen since the 11th of September,–nearly five months; and I really\nfelt something like an affection for the old brig which had been my\nfirst home, and in which I had spent nearly a year, and got the\nfirst rough and tumble of a sea life.  She, too, was associated,\nin my mind with Boston, the wharf from which we sailed, anchorage\nin the stream, leave-taking, and all such matters, which were now\nto me like small links connecting me with another world, which I\nhad once been in, and which, please God, I might yet see again. \nI went on board the first night, after supper; found the old\ncook in the galley, playing upon the fife which I had given him,\nas a parting present; had a hearty shake of the hand from him;\nand dove down into the forecastle, where were my old ship-mates,\nthe same as ever, glad to see me; for they had nearly given us up\nas lost, especially when they did not find us in Santa Barbara. \nThey had been at San Diego last, had been lying at San Pedro\nnearly a month, and had received three thousand hides from the\npueblo.  These were taken from her the next day, which filled\nus up, and we both got under weigh on the 4th, she bound up to\nSan Francisco again, and we to San Diego, where we arrived on\nthe 6th. ",
        "We were always glad to see San Diego; it being the depot, and a\nsnug little place, and seeming quite like home, especially to\nme, who had spent a summer there.  There was no vessel in port,\nthe Rosa having sailed for Valparaiso and Cadiz, and the Catalina\nfor Callao, nearly a month before.  We discharged our hides, and in\nfour days were ready to sail again for the windward; and, to our\ngreat joy–for the last time!  Over thirty thousand hides had\nbeen already collected, cured, and stowed away in the house,\nwhich, together with what we should collect, and the Pilgrim\nwould bring down from San Francisco, would make out her cargo. \nThe thought that we were actually going up for the last time,\nand that the next time we went round San Diego point it would\nbe “homeward bound,” brought things so near a close, that we\nfelt as though we were just there, though it must still be the\ngreater part of a year before we could see Boston. ",
        "I spent one evening, as had been my custom, at the oven with the\nSandwich Islanders; but it was far from being the usual noisy,\nlaughing time.  It has been said, that the greatest curse to each\nof the South Sea islands, was the first man who discovered it;\nand every one who knows anything of the history of our commerce\nin those parts, knows how much truth there is in this; and that\nthe white men, with their vices, have brought in diseases before\nunknown to the islanders, and which are now sweeping off the native\npopulation of the Sandwich Islands, at the rate of one fortieth of\nthe entire population annually.  They seem to be a doomed people. \nThe curse of a people calling themselves Christian, seems to follow\nthem everywhere; and even here, in this obscure place, lay two\nyoung islanders, whom I had left strong, active young men, in the\nvigor of health, wasting away under a disease, which they would\nnever have known but for their intercourse with Christianized Mexico\nand people from Christian America.  One of them was not so ill; and\nwas moving about, smoking his pipe, and talking, and trying to keep\nup his spirits; but the other, who was my friend, and Aikane–Hope,\nwas the most dreadful object I had ever seen in my life: his eyes\nsunken and dead, his cheeks fallen in against his teeth, his hands\nlooking like claws; a dreadful cough, which seemed to rack his whole\nshattered system, a hollow whispering voice, and an entire inability\nto move himself.  There he lay, upon a mat, on the ground, which was\nthe only floor of the oven, with no medicine, no comforts, and no\none to care for, or help him, but a few Kanakas, who were willing\nenough, but could do nothing.  The sight of him made me sick,\nand faint.  Poor fellow!  During the four months that I lived\nupon the beach, we were continually together, both in work, and\nin our excursions in the woods, and upon the water.  I really\nfelt a strong affection for him, and preferred him to any of my\nown countrymen there; and I believe there was nothing which he\nwould not have done for me.  When I came into the oven he looked\nat me, held out his hand, and said, in a low voice, but with a\ndelightful smile, “Aloha, Aikane!  Aloha nui!”  I comforted him\nas well as I could, and promised to ask the captain to help him\nfrom the medicine-chest, and told him I had no doubt the captain\nwould do what he could for him, as he had worked in our employ for\nseveral years, both on shore and aboard our vessels on the coast.\nI went aboard and turned into my hammock, but I could not sleep.",
        "Thinking, from my education, that I must have some knowledge of\nmedicine, the Kanakas had insisted upon my examining him carefully;\nand it was not a sight to be forgotten.  One of our crew, an old\nman-of-war’s man, of twenty years’ standing, who had seen sin\nand suffering in every shape, and whom I afterwards took to\nsee Hope, said it was dreadfully worse than anything he had\never seen, or even dreamed of.  He was horror-struck, as his\ncountenance showed; yet he had been among the worst cases in\nour naval hospitals.  I could not get the thought of the poor\nfellow out of my head all night; his horrible suffering, and his\napparently inevitable, horrible end. ",
        "The next day I told the captain of Hope’s state, and asked him\nif he would be so kind as to go and see him. ",
        "“What? a d––d Kanaka?” ",
        "“Yes, sir,” said I; “but he has worked four years for our vessels,\nand has been in the employ of our owners, both on shore and aboard.” ",
        "“Oh! he be d––d!” said the captain, and walked off. ",
        "This same man died afterwards of a fever on the deadly coast of\nSumatra; and God grant he had better care taken of him in his\nsufferings, than he ever gave to any one else!  Finding nothing\nwas to be got from the captain, I consulted an old shipmate, who\nhad much experience in these matters, and got from him a recipe,\nwhich he always kept by him.  With this I went to the mate, and told\nhim the case.  Mr. Brown had been entrusted with the general care of\nthe medicine-chest, and although a driving fellow, and a taught hand\nin a watch, he had good feelings, and was always inclined to be kind\nto the sick.  He said that Hope was not strictly one of the crew,\nbut as he was in our employ when taken sick, he should have the\nmedicines; and he got them and gave them to me, with leave to go\nashore at night.  Nothing could exceed the delight of the Kanakas,\nwhen I came bringing the medicines.  All their terms of affection\nand gratitude were spent upon me, and in a sense wasted, (for I\ncould not understand half of them,) yet they made all known by\ntheir manner.  Poor Hope was so much revived at the bare thought\nof anything’s being done for him, that he was already stronger\nand better.  I knew he must die as he was, and he could but die\nunder the medicines, and any chance was worth running.  An oven,\nexposed to every wind and change of weather, is no place to take\ncalomel; but nothing else would do, and strong remedies must be\nused, or he was gone.  The applications, internal and external,\nwere powerful, and I gave him strict directions to keep warm\nand sheltered, telling him it was his only chance for life.\nTwice, after this, I visited him, having only time to run up,\nwhile waiting in the boat.  He promised to take his medicines\nregularly until we returned, and insisted upon it that he was\ndoing better.",
        "We got under weigh on the 10th, bound up to San Pedro, and had\nthree days of calm and head winds, making but little progress.\nOn the fourth, we took a stiff south-easter, which obliged us\nto reef our topsails.  While on the yard, we saw a sail on the\nweather bow, and in about half an hour, passed the Ayacucho,\nunder double-reefed topsails, beating down to San Diego.\nArrived at San Pedro on the fourth day, and came-to in the old\nplace, a league from shore, with no other vessel in port, and the\nprospect of three weeks, or more, of dull life, rolling goods up\na slippery hill, carrying hides on our heads over sharp stones,\nand, perhaps, slipping for a south-easter.",
        "There was but one man in the only house here, and him I shall\nalways remember as a good specimen of a California ranger.\nHe had been a tailor in Philadelphia, and getting intemperate\nand in debt, he joined a trapping party and went to the Columbia\nriver, and thence down to Monterey, where he spent everything,\nleft his party, and came to the Pueblo de los Angelos, to work\nat his trade.  Here he went dead to leeward among the pulperias,\ngambling rooms, etc., and came down to San Pedro, to be moral by\nbeing out of temptation.  He had been in the house several weeks,\nworking hard at his trade, upon orders which he had brought with him,\nand talked much of his resolution, and opened his heart to us about\nhis past life.  After we had been here some time, he started off\none morning, in fine spirits, well dressed, to carry the clothes\nwhich he had been making to the pueblo, and saying he would bring\nback his money and some fresh orders the next day.  The next day\ncame, and a week passed, and nearly a fortnight, when, one day,\ngoing ashore, we saw a tall man, who looked like our friend the\ntailor, getting out of the back of an Indian’s cart, which had\njust come down from the pueblo. He stood for the house, but we bore\nup after him; when finding that we were overhauling him, he hove-to\nand spoke us.  Such a sight I never saw before.  Barefooted, with an\nold pair of trowsers tied round his waist by a piece of green hide,\na soiled cotton shirt, and a torn Indian hat; “cleaned out,” to the\nlast reál, and completely “used up.”  He confessed the whole matter;\nacknowledged that he was on his back; and now he had a prospect of a\nfit of the horrors for a week, and of being worse than useless for\nmonths.  This is a specimen of the life of half of the Americans\nand English who are adrift over the whole of California.  One of\nthe same stamp was Russell, who was master of the hide-house\nat San Diego, while I was there, and afterwards turned away\nfor his misconduct.  He spent his own money and nearly all\nthe stores among the half-bloods upon the beach, and being\nturned away, went up to the Presidio, where he lived the life\nof a desperate “loafer,” until some rascally deed sent him off\n“between two days,” with men on horseback, dogs, and Indians in\nfull cry after him, among the hills.  One night, he burst into our\nroom at the hide-house, breathless, pale as a ghost, covered with\nmud, and torn by thorns and briers, nearly naked, and begged for\na crust of bread, saying he had neither eaten nor slept for three\ndays.  Here was the great Mr. Russell, who a month before was “Don\nTomàs,” “Capitán de la playa,” “Maéstro de la casa,” etc., etc.,\nbegging food and shelter of Kanakas and sailors.  He staid with\nus till he gave himself up, and was dragged off to the calabozo.",
        "Another, and a more amusing specimen, was one whom we saw at San\nFrancisco.  He had been a lad on board the ship California, in one\nof her first voyages, and ran away and commenced Ranchéro, gambling,\nstealing horses, etc. He worked along up to San Francisco, and was\nliving on a rancho near there, while we were in port.  One morning,\nwhen we went ashore in the boat, we found him at the landing-place,\ndressed in California style,–a wide hat, faded velveteen trowsers,\nand a blanket cloak thrown over his shoulders–and wishing to go off\nin the boat, saying he was going to paseár with our captain a little.\nWe had many doubts of the reception he would meet with; but he\nseemed to think himself company for any one.  We took him aboard,\nlanded him at the gangway, and went about our work, keeping an eye\nupon the quarter-deck, where the captain was walking.  The lad\nwent up to him with the most complete assurance, and raising his\nhat, wished him a good afternoon.  Captain T––- turned round,\nlooked at him from head to foot, and saying coolly, “Hallo! who\nthe h–- are you?” kept on his walk.  This was a rebuff not to\nbe mistaken, and the joke passed about among the crew by winks\nand signs, at different parts of the ship.  Finding himself\ndisappointed at headquarters, he edged along forward to the mate,\nwho was overseeing some work on the forecastle, and tried to begin\na yarn; but it would not do. The mate had seen the reception he\nhad met with aft, and would have no cast-off company.  The second\nmate was aloft, and the third mate and myself were painting the\nquarter-boat, which hung by the davits, so he betook himself to\nus; but we looked at one another, and the officer was too busy\nto say a word.  From us, he went to one and another of the crew,\nbut the joke had got before him, and he found everybody busy and\nsilent.  Looking over the rail a few moments afterward, we saw him\nat the galley-door talking to the cook.  This was a great comedown,\nfrom the highest seat in the synagogue to a seat in the galley with\nthe black cook.  At night, too, when supper was called, he stood in\nthe waist for some time, hoping to be asked down with the officers,\nbut they went below, one after another, and left him.  His next\nchance was with the carpenter and sail-maker, and he lounged round\nthe after hatchway until the last had gone down.  We had now had\nfun enough out of him, and taking pity on him, offered him a pot\nof tea, and a cut at the kid, with the rest, in the forecastle.\nHe was hungry, and it was growing dark, and he began to see that\nthere was no use in playing the caballero any longer, and came\ndown into the forecastle, put into the “grub” in sailor’s style,\nthrew off all his airs, and enjoyed the joke as much as any one;\nfor a man must take a joke among sailors.  He gave us the whole\naccount of his adventures in the country,–roguery and all–and\nwas very entertaining.  He was a smart, unprincipled fellow, was at\nthe bottom of most of the rascally doings of the country, and gave\nus a great deal of interesting information in the ways of the world\nwe were in.",
        "Saturday, Feb. 13th.  Were called up at midnight to slip for\na violent north-easter, for this rascally hole of San Pedro is\nunsafe in every wind but a south-wester, which is seldom known\nto blow more than once in a half century.  We went off with a\nflowing sheet, and hove-to under the lee of Catalina island,\nwhere we lay three days, and then returned to our anchorage. ",
        "Tuesday, Feb. 23d.  This afternoon, a signal was made from the\nshore, and we went off in the gig, and found the agent’s clerk,\nwho had been up to the pueblo, waiting at the landing-place, with a\npackage under his arm, covered with brown papers and tied carefully\nwith twine.  No sooner had we shoved off than he told us there was\ngood news from Santa Barbara.  “What’s that?” said one of the crew;\n“has the bloody agent slipped off the hooks?  Has the old bundle of\nbones got him at last?\"–\"No; better than that.  The California\nhas arrived.”  Letters, papers, news, and, perhaps,–friends, on\nboard!  Our hearts were all up in our mouths, and we pulled away\nlike good fellows; for the precious packet could not be opened\nexcept by the captain.  As we pulled under the stern, the clerk\nheld up the package, and called out to the mate, who was leaning\nover the taffrail, that the California had arrived. ",
        "“Hurrah!” said the mate, so as to be heard fore and aft;\n“California come, and news from Boston!” ",
        "Instantly there was a confusion on board which no one could account\nfor who has not been in the same situation.  All discipline seemed\nfor a moment relaxed. ",
        "“What’s that, Mr. Brown?” said the cook, putting his head out of\nthe galley–\"California come?” ",
        "“Aye, aye! you angel of darkness, and there’s a letter for you\nfrom Bullknop ’treet, number two-two-five–green door and brass\nknocker!” ",
        "The packet was sent down into the cabin, and every one waited\nto hear of the result.  As nothing came up, the officers began\nto feel that they were acting rather a child’s part, and turned\nthe crew to again and the same strict discipline was restored,\nwhich prohibits speech between man and man, while at work on\ndeck; so that, when the steward came forward with letters for\nthe crew, each man took his letters, carried them below to his\nchest, and came up again immediately; and not a letter was read\nuntil we had cleared up decks for the night. ",
        "An overstrained sense of manliness is the characteristic of\nseafaring men, or, rather, of life on board ship.  This often\ngives an appearance of want of feeling, and even of cruelty.\nFrom this, if a man comes within an ace of breaking his neck\nand escapes, it is made a joke of; and no notice must be taken\nof a bruise or cut; and any expression of pity, or any show of\nattention, would look sisterly, and unbecoming a man who has to\nface the rough and tumble of such a life.  From this, too, the sick\nare neglected at sea, and whatever sailors may be ashore, a sick\nman finds little sympathy or attention, forward or aft. A man, too,\ncan have nothing peculiar or sacred on board ship; for all the nicer\nfeelings they take pride in disregarding, both in themselves and\nothers.  A thin-skinned man could not live an hour on ship-board.\nOne would be torn raw unless he had the hide of an ox. A moment of\nnatural feeling for home and friends, and then the frigid routine\nof sea-life returned.  Jokes were made upon those who showed any\ninterest in the expected news, and everything near and dear was\nmade common stock for rude jokes and unfeeling coarseness, to which\nno exception could be taken by any one.",
        "Supper, too, must be eaten before the letters were read; and when,\nat last, they were brought out, they all got round any one who had\na letter, and expected to have it read aloud, and have it all in\ncommon.  If any one went by himself to read, it was–\"Fair play,\nthere; and no skulking!”  I took mine and went into the sailmaker’s\nberth, where I could read it without interruption.  It was dated\nAugust, just a year from the time I had sailed from home; and every\none was well, and no great change had taken place.  Thus, for one\nyear, my mind was set at ease, yet it was already six months from\nthe date of the letter, and what another year would bring to pass,\nwho could tell?  Every one away from home thinks that some great\nthing must have happened, while to those at home there seems to\nbe a continued monotony and lack of incident. ",
        "As much as my feelings were taken up by my own intelligence\nfrom home, I could not but be amused by a scene in the steerage. \nThe carpenter had been married just before leaving Boston, and\nduring the voyage had talked much about his wife, and had to bear\nand forbear, as every man, known to be married, must, aboard ship;\nyet the certainty of hearing from his wife by the first ship, seemed\nto keep up his spirits.  The California came, the packet was brought\non board; no one was in higher spirits than he; but when the letters\ncame forward, there was none for him.  The captain looked again,\nbut there was no mistake.  Poor “Chips,” could eat no supper. \nHe was completely down in the mouth.  “Sails” (the sailmaker)\ntried to comfort him, and told him he was a bloody fool to give\nup his grub for any woman’s daughter, and reminded him that he\nhad told him a dozen times that he’d never see or hear from his\nwife again. ",
        "“Ah!” said “Chips,” “you don’t know what it is to have a wife, and\"–",
        "“Don’t I?” said Sails; and then came, for the hundredth time, the story\nof his coming ashore at New York, from the Constellation frigate,\nafter a cruise of four years round the Horn,–being paid off with\nover five hundred dollars,–marrying, and taking a couple of rooms\nin a four-story house,–furnishing the rooms, (with a particular\naccount of the furniture, including a dozen flag-bottomed chairs,\nwhich he always dilated upon, whenever the subject of furniture was\nalluded to,)–going off to sea again, leaving his wife half-pay,\nlike a fool,–coming home and finding her “off, like Bob’s horse,\nwith nobody to pay the reckoning;” furniture gone,–flag-bottomed\nchairs and all;–and with it, his “long togs,” the half-pay,\nhis beaver hat, white linen shirts, and everything else.  His wife\nhe never saw, or heard of, from that day to this, and never wished\nto.  Then followed a sweeping assertion, not much to the credit of\nthe sex, if true, though he has Pope to back him.  “Come, Chips,\ncheer up like a man, and take some hot grub!  Don’t be made a fool\nof by anything in petticoats!  As for your wife, you’ll never see\nher again; she was ’up keeleg and off’ before you were outside of\nCape Cod.  You hove your money away like a fool; but every man\nmust learn once, just as I did; so you’d better square the yards\nwith her, and make the best of it.” ",
        "This was the best consolation “Sails” had to offer, but it did not\nseem to be just the thing the carpenter wanted; for, during several\ndays, he was very much dejected, and bore with difficulty the jokes\nof the sailors, and with still more difficulty their attempts at\nadvice and consolation, of most of which the sailmaker’s was a\ngood specimen. ",
        "Thursday, Feb. 25th.  Set sail for Santa Barbara, where we arrived\non Sunday, the 28th.  We just missed of seeing the California, for she\nhad sailed three days before, bound to Monterey, to enter her cargo and\nprocure her license, and thence to San Francisco, etc. Captain Arthur\nleft files of Boston papers for Captain T––-, which, after they had\nbeen read and talked over in the cabin, I procured from my friend\nthe third mate.  One file was of all the Boston Transcripts for\nthe month of August, 1835, and the rest were about a dozen Daily\nAdvertisers and Couriers, of different dates.  After all, there is\nnothing in a strange land like a newspaper from home.  Even a letter,\nin many respects, is nothing, in comparison with it.  It carries you\nback to the spot, better than anything else.  It is almost equal to\nclairvoyance.  The names of the streets, with the things advertised,\nare almost as good as seeing the signs; and while reading “Boy lost!” \none can almost hear the bell and well-known voice of “Old Wilson,\"\ncrying the boy as “strayed, stolen, or mislaid!”  Then there was\nthe Commencement at Cambridge, and the full account of the\nexercises at the graduating of my own class.  A list of all\nthose familiar names, (beginning as usual with Abbot, and ending\nwith W., ) which, as I read them over, one by one, brought up their\nfaces and characters as I had known them in the various scenes of\ncollege life.  Then I imagined them upon the stage, speaking their\norations, dissertations, colloquies, etc., with the gestures and\ntones of each, and tried to fancy the manner in which each would\nhandle his subject, *****, handsome, showy, and superficial; *****,\nwith his strong head, clear brain, cool self-possession; *****,\nmodest, sensitive, and underrated; *****, the mouth-piece of the\ndebating clubs, noisy, vaporous, and democratic; and so following. \nThen I could see them receiving their A. Bs. from the dignified,\nfeudal-looking President, with his “auctoritate mihi commissâ,\"\nand walking off the stage with their diplomas in their hands;\nwhile upon the very same day, their classmate was walking up\nand down California beach with a hide upon his head. ",
        "Every watch below, for a week, I pored over these papers, until I was\nsure there could be nothing in them that had escaped my attention,\nand was ashamed to keep them any longer. ",
        "Saturday, March 5th.  This was an important day in our almanac,\nfor it was on this day that we were first assured that our voyage\nwas really drawing to a close.  The captain gave orders to have\nthe ship ready for getting under weigh; and observed that there\nwas a good breeze to take us down to San Pedro.  Then we were not\ngoing up to windward.  Thus much was certain, and was soon known,\nfore and aft; and when we went in the gig to take him off, he shook\nhands with the people on the beach, and said that he never expected\nto see Santa Barbara again.  This settled the matter, and sent a\nthrill of pleasure through the heart of every one in the boat. \nWe pulled off with a will, saying to ourselves (I can speak for\nmyself at least)–\"Good-by, Santa Barbara!–This is the last pull\nhere–No more duckings in your breakers, and slipping from your\ncursed south-easters!”  The news was soon known aboard, and put\nlife into everything when we were getting under weigh.  Each one\nwas taking his last look at the mission, the town, the breakers\non the beach, and swearing that no money would make him ship to\nsee them again; and when all hands tallied on to the cat-fall,\nthe chorus of “Time for us to go!” was raised for the first time,\nand joined in, with full swing, by everybody.  One would have thought\nwe were on our voyage home, so near did it seem to us, though there\nwere yet three months for us on the coast. ",
        "We left here the young Englishman, George Marsh, of whom I have\nbefore spoken, who was wrecked upon the Pelew Islands.  He left us\nto take the berth of second mate on board the Ayacucho, which was\nlying in port.  He was well qualified for this, and his education\nwould enable him to rise to any situation on board ship.  I felt\nreally sorry to part from him.  There was something about him which\nexcited my curiosity; for I could not, for a moment, doubt that he\nwas well born, and, in early life, well bred.  There was the latent\ngentleman about him, and the sense of honor, and no little of the\npride, of a young man of good family.  The situation was offered\nhim only a few hours before we sailed; and though he must give up\nreturning to America, yet I have no doubt that the change from a\ndog’s berth to an officer’s, was too agreeable to his feelings to\nbe declined.  We pulled him on board the Ayacucho, and when he left\nthe boat he gave each of its crew a piece of money, except myself,\nand shook hands with me, nodding his head, as much as to say,–\"We\nunderstand one another,” and sprang on board.  Had I known, an hour\nsooner, that he was to leave us, I would have made an effort to get\nfrom him the true history of his early life.  He knew that I had\nno faith in the story which he told the crew, and perhaps, in the\nmoment of parting from me, probably forever, he would have given me\nthe true account.  Whether I shall ever meet him again, or whether\nhis manuscript narrative of his adventures in the Pelew Islands,\nwhich would be creditable to him and interesting to the world,\nwill ever see the light, I cannot tell.  His is one of those cases\nwhich are more numerous than those suppose, who have never lived\nanywhere but in their own homes, and never walked but in one line\nfrom their cradles to their graves.  We must come down from our\nheights, and leave our straight paths, for the byways and low\nplaces of life, if we would learn truths by strong contrasts;\nand in hovels, in forecastles, and among our own outcasts in\nforeign lands, see what has been wrought upon our fellow-creatures\nby accident, hardship, or vice.",
        "Two days brought us to San Pedro, and two days more (to our\nno small joy) gave us our last view of that place, which was\nuniversally called the hell of California, and seemed designed,\nin every way, for the wear and tear of sailors.  Not even the last\nview could bring out one feeling of regret.  No thanks, thought I,\nas we left the sandy shores in the distance, for the hours I have\nwalked over your stones, barefooted, with hides on my head;–for\nthe burdens I have carried up your steep, muddy hill;  for the\nduckings in your surf; and for the long days and longer nights\npassed on your desolate hill, watching piles of hides, hearing\nthe sharp bark of your eternal coati, and the dismal hooting of\nyour owls. ",
        "As I bade good-by to each successive place, I felt as though one\nlink after another were struck from the chain of my servitude.\nHaving kept close in shore, for the land-breeze, we passed the\nmission of San Juan Campestráno the same night, and saw distinctly,\nby the bright moonlight, the hill which I had gone down by a pair of\nhalyards in search of a few paltry hides.  “Forsan et haec olim,\"\nthought I, and took my last look of that place too.  And on the\nnext morning we were under the high point of San Diego.  The flood\ntide took us swiftly in, and we came-to, opposite our hide-house,\nand prepared to get everything in trim for a long stay.  This was\nour last port.  Here we were to discharge everything from the ship,\nclean her out, smoke her, take in our hides, wood, water, etc.,\nand set sail for Boston.  While all this was doing, we were to\nlie still in one place, and the port was a safe one, and there\nwas no fear of south-easters.  Accordingly, having picked out\na good berth, in the stream, with a good smooth beach opposite,\nfor a landing-place and within two cables’ length of our hide-house,\nwe moored ship, unbent all the sails, sent down the top-gallant\nyards and all the studding-sail booms, and housed the top-gallant\nmasts.  The boats were then hove out, and all the sails, spare spars,\nthe stores, the rigging not rove, and, in fact, everything which\nwas not in daily use, sent ashore, and stowed away in the house.\nThen went all our hides and horns, and we left hardly anything\nin the ship but her ballast, and this we made preparation to\nheave out, the next day.  At night, after we had knocked off,\nand were sitting round in the forecastle, smoking and talking\nand taking sailor’s pleasure, we congratulated ourselves upon\nbeing in that situation in which we had wished ourselves every\ntime we had come into San Diego.  “If we were only here for the\nlast time,” we had often said, “with our top-gallant masts housed\nand our sails unbent!\"–and now we had our wish.
