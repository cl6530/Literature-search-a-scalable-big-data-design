        "  However, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more\nhuman:  when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that\nit had eyes and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to\nit, she saw clearly that it was HUMPTY DUMPTY himself.  ’It can’t\nbe anybody else!’ she said to herself.  ’I’m as certain of it, as\nif his name were written all over his face.’",
        "  It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that\nenormous face.  Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed,\nlike a Turk, on the top of a high wall–such a narrow one that\nAlice quite wondered how he could keep his balance–and, as his\neyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction, and he didn’t\ntake the least notice of her, she thought he must be a stuffed\nfigure after all.",
        "  ’And how exactly like an egg he is!’ she said aloud, standing\nwith her hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment\nexpecting him to fall.",
        "  ’It’s VERY provoking,’ Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence,\nlooking away from Alice as he spoke, ’to be called an egg–\nVERY!’",
        "  ’I said you LOOKED like an egg, Sir,’ Alice gently explained.\n’And some eggs are very pretty, you know’ she added, hoping to\nturn her remark into a sort of a compliment.",
        "  ’Some people,’ said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as\nusual, ’have no more sense than a baby!’",
        "  Alice didn’t know what to say to this:  it wasn’t at all like\nconversation, she thought, as he never said anything to HER; in\nfact, his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree–so she\nstood and softly repeated to herself:–",
        "            ’Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall:\n            Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.\n            All the King’s horses and all the King’s men\n            Couldn’t put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.’",
        "  ’That last line is much too long for the poetry,’ she added,\nalmost out loud, forgetting that Humpty Dumpty would hear her.",
        "  ’Don’t stand there chattering to yourself like that,’ Humpty\nDumpty said, looking at her for the first time, ’but tell me your\nname and your business.’",
        "  ’My NAME is Alice, but–’",
        "  ’It’s a stupid enough name!’ Humpty Dumpty interrupted impatiently.\n’What does it mean?’",
        "  ’MUST a name mean something?’ Alice asked doubtfully.",
        "  ’Of course it must,’ Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh:\n’MY name means the shape I am–and a good handsome shape it is,\ntoo.  With a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.’",
        "  ’Why do you sit out here all alone?’ said Alice, not wishing\nto begin an argument.",
        "  ’Why, because there’s nobody with me!’ cried Humpty Dumpty.\n’Did you think I didn’t know the answer to THAT?  Ask another.’",
        "  ’Don’t you think you’d be safer down on the ground?’ Alice went\non, not with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her\ngood-natured anxiety for the queer creature.  ’That wall is so\nVERY narrow!’",
        "  ’What tremendously easy riddles you ask!’ Humpty Dumpty growled\nout.  ’Of course I don’t think so!  Why, if ever I DID fall off–\nwhich there’s no chance of–but IF I did–’  Here he pursed\nhis lips and looked so solemn and grand that Alice could hardly\nhelp laughing.  ’IF I did fall,’ he went on, ’THE KING HAS\nPROMISED ME–WITH HIS VERY OWN MOUTH–to–to–’",
        "  ’To send all his horses and all his men,’ Alice interrupted,\nrather unwisely.",
        "  ’Now I declare that’s too bad!’ Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into\na sudden passion.  ’You’ve been listening at doors–and behind trees–\nand down chimneys–or you couldn’t have known it!’",
        "  ’I haven’t, indeed!’ Alice said very gently.  ’It’s in a book.’",
        "  ’Ah, well!  They may write such things in a BOOK,’ Humpty\nDumpty said in a calmer tone.  ’That’s what you call a History of\nEngland, that is.  Now, take a good look at me!  I’m one that has\nspoken to a King, I am:  mayhap you’ll never see such another:\nand to show you I’m not proud, you may shake hands with me!’  And\nhe grinned almost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as\nnearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so) and offered\nAlice his hand.  She watched him a little anxiously as she took\nit.  ’If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet\nbehind,’ she thought:  ’and then I don’t know what would happen\nto his head!  I’m afraid it would come off!’",
        "  ’Yes, all his horses and all his men,’ Humpty Dumpty went on.\n’They’d pick me up again in a minute, THEY would!  However, this\nconversation is going on a little too fast:  let’s go back to the\nlast remark but one.’",
        "  ’I’m afraid I can’t quite remember it,’ Alice said very\npolitely.",
        "  ’In that case we start fresh,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ’and it’s my\nturn to choose a subject–’  (’He talks about it just as if it\nwas a game!’ thought Alice.)  ’So here’s a question for you.  How\nold did you say you were?’",
        "  Alice made a short calculation, and said ’Seven years and six\nmonths.’",
        "  ’Wrong!’  Humpty Dumpty exclaimed triumphantly.  ’You never\nsaid a word like it!’",
        "  ’I though you meant “How old ARE you?\"’ Alice explained.",
        "  ’If I’d meant that, I’d have said it,’ said Humpty Dumpty.",
        "  Alice didn’t want to begin another argument, so she said\nnothing.",
        "  ’Seven years and six months!’  Humpty Dumpty repeated\nthoughtfully.  ’An uncomfortable sort of age.  Now if you’d asked\nMY advice, I’d have said “Leave off at seven\"–but it’s too\nlate now.’",
        "  ’I never ask advice about growing,’ Alice said indignantly.",
        "  ’Too proud?’ the other inquired.",
        "  Alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion.  ’I mean,’\nshe said, ’that one can’t help growing older.’",
        "  ’ONE can’t, perhaps,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ’but TWO can.  With\nproper assistance, you might have left off at seven.’",
        "  ’What a beautiful belt you’ve got on!’ Alice suddenly remarked.",
        "(They had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought:\nand if they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it\nwas her turn now.)  ’At least,’ she corrected herself on second\nthoughts, ’a beautiful cravat, I should have said–no, a belt,\nI mean–I beg your pardon!’ she added in dismay, for Humpty\nDumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she began to wish she\nhadn’t chosen that subject.  ’If I only knew,’ she thought to\nherself, ’which was neck and which was waist!’",
        "  Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing\nfor a minute or two.  When he DID speak again, it was in a deep\ngrowl.",
        "  ’It is a–MOST–PROVOKING–thing,’ he said at last, ’when\na person doesn’t know a cravat from a belt!’",
        "  ’I know it’s very ignorant of me,’ Alice said, in so humble a\ntone that Humpty Dumpty relented.",
        "  ’It’s a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say.  It’s a\npresent from the White King and Queen.  There now!’",
        "  ’Is it really?’ said Alice, quite pleased to find that she HAD\nchosen a good subject, after all.",
        "  ’They gave it me,’ Humpty Dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he\ncrossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it,\n’they gave it me–for an un-birthday present.’",
        "  ’I beg your pardon?’ Alice said with a puzzled air.",
        "  ’I’m not offended,’ said Humpty Dumpty.",
        "  ’I mean, what IS an un-birthday present?’",
        "  ’A present given when it isn’t your birthday, of course.’",
        "  Alice considered a little.  ’I like birthday presents best,’\nshe said at last.",
        "  ’You don’t know what you’re talking about!’ cried Humpty\nDumpty.  ’How many days are there in a year?’",
        "  ’Three hundred and sixty-five,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’And how many birthdays have you?’",
        "  ’One.’",
        "  ’And if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what\nremains?’",
        "  ’Three hundred and sixty-four, of course.’",
        "  Humpty Dumpty looked doubtful.  ’I’d rather see that done on\npaper,’ he said.",
        "  Alice couldn’t help smiling as she took out her memorandum-\nbook, and worked the sum for him:",
        "   365\n     1\n   _\n   364\n   _\n  Humpty Dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully.  ’That\nseems to be done right–’ he began.",
        "  ’You’re holding it upside down!’ Alice interrupted.",
        "  ’To be sure I was!’ Humpty Dumpty said gaily, as she turned it\nround for him.  ’I thought it looked a little queer.  As I was\nsaying, that SEEMS to be done right–though I haven’t time to\nlook it over thoroughly just now–and that shows that there are\nthree hundred and sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday\npresents–’",
        "  ’Certainly,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’And only ONE for birthday presents, you know.  There’s glory\nfor you!’",
        "  ’I don’t know what you mean by “glory,\"’ Alice said.",
        "  Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously.  ’Of course you don’t–\ntill I tell you.  I meant “there’s a nice knock-down argument for\nyou!\"’",
        "  ’But “glory” doesn’t mean “a nice knock-down argument,\"’ Alice\nobjected.",
        "",
        "  ’When I use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful\ntone, ’it means just what I choose it to mean–neither more nor\nless.’",
        "  ’The question is,’ said Alice, ’whether you CAN make words mean\nso many different things.’",
        "  ’The question is,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ’which is to be master–\nthat’s all.’",
        "  Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute\nHumpty Dumpty began again.  ’They’ve a temper, some of them–\nparticularly verbs, they’re the proudest–adjectives you can do\nanything with, but not verbs–however, I can manage the whole\nlot of them!  Impenetrability!  That’s what I say!’",
        "  ’Would you tell me, please,’ said Alice ’what that means?’",
        "  ’Now you talk like a reasonable child,’ said Humpty Dumpty,\nlooking very much pleased.  ’I meant by “impenetrability” that\nwe’ve had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well\nif you’d mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don’t\nmean to stop here all the rest of your life.’",
        "  ’That’s a great deal to make one word mean,’ Alice said in a\nthoughtful tone.",
        "  ’When I make a word do a lot of work like that,’ said Humpty\nDumpty, ’I always pay it extra.’",
        "  ’Oh!’ said Alice.  She was too much puzzled to make any other\nremark.",
        "  ’Ah, you should see ’em come round me of a Saturday night,’\nHumpty Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to\nside:  ’for to get their wages, you know.’",
        "  (Alice didn’t venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you\nsee I can’t tell YOU.)",
        "  ’You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,’ said Alice.\n’Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called\n“Jabberwocky”?’",
        "  ’Let’s hear it,’ said Humpty Dumpty.  ’I can explain all the\npoems that were ever invented–and a good many that haven’t\nbeen invented just yet.’",
        "  This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse:",
        "            ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\n              Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;\n            All mimsy were the borogoves,\n              And the mome raths outgrabe.",
        "  ’That’s enough to begin with,’ Humpty Dumpty interrupted:\n’there are plenty of hard words there.  “BRILLIG” means four\no’clock in the afternoon–the time when you begin BROILING\nthings for dinner.’",
        "  ’That’ll do very well,’ said Alice:  and “SLITHY”?’",
        "  ’Well, “SLITHY” means “lithe and slimy.”  “Lithe” is the same\nas “active.”  You see it’s like a portmanteau–there are two\nmeanings packed up into one word.’",
        "  ’I see it now,’ Alice remarked thoughtfully:  ’and what are\n“TOVES”?’",
        "  ’Well, “TOVES” are something like badgers–they’re something\nlike lizards–and they’re something like corkscrews.’",
        "  ’They must be very curious looking creatures.’",
        "  ’They are that,’ said Humpty Dumpty:  ’also they make their\nnests under sun-dials–also they live on cheese.’",
        "  ’And what’s the “GYRE” and to “GIMBLE”?’",
        "  ’To “GYRE” is to go round and round like a gyroscope.  To\n“GIMBLE” is to make holes like a gimlet.’",
        "  ’And “THE WABE” is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, I suppose?’\nsaid Alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.",
        "  ’Of course it is.  It’s called “WABE,” you know, because it\ngoes a long way before it, and a long way behind it–’",
        "  ’And a long way beyond it on each side,’ Alice added.",
        "  ’Exactly so.  Well, then, “MIMSY” is “flimsy and miserable\"\n(there’s another portmanteau for you).  And a “BOROGOVE” is a\nthin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round–\nsomething like a live mop.’",
        "  ’And then “MOME RATHS”?’ said Alice.  ’I’m afraid I’m giving\nyou a great deal of trouble.’",
        "  ’Well, a “RATH” is a sort of green pig:  but “MOME” I’m not\ncertain about.  I think it’s short for “from home\"–meaning\nthat they’d lost their way, you know.’",
        "  ’And what does “OUTGRABE” mean?’",
        "  ’Well, “OUTGRABING” is something between bellowing and\nwhistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle:  however, you’ll\nhear it done, maybe–down in the wood yonder–and when you’ve\nonce heard it you’ll be QUITE content.  Who’s been repeating all\nthat hard stuff to you?’",
        "  ’I read it in a book,’ said Alice.  ’But I had some poetry\nrepeated to me, much easier than that, by–Tweedledee, I think\nit was.’",
        "  ’As to poetry, you know,’ said Humpty Dumpty, stretching out\none of his great hands, ’I can repeat poetry as well as other\nfolk, if it comes to that–’",
        "  ’Oh, it needn’t come to that!’ Alice hastily said, hoping to\nkeep him from beginning.",
        "  ’The piece I’m going to repeat,’ he went on without noticing\nher remark,’ was written entirely for your amusement.’",
        "  Alice felt that in that case she really OUGHT to listen to it,\nso she sat down, and said ’Thank you’ rather sadly.",
        "            ’In winter, when the fields are white,\n            I sing this song for your delight–",
        "only I don’t sing it,’ he added, as an explanation.",
        "  ’I see you don’t,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’If you can SEE whether I’m singing or not, you’ve sharper eyes\nthan most.’ Humpty Dumpty remarked severely.  Alice was silent.",
        "            ’In spring, when woods are getting green,\n            I’ll try and tell you what I mean.’",
        "  ’Thank you very much,’ said Alice.",
        "            ’In summer, when the days are long,\n            Perhaps you’ll understand the song:\n            In autumn, when the leaves are brown,\n            Take pen and ink, and write it down.’",
        "  ’I will, if I can remember it so long,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’You needn’t go on making remarks like that,’ Humpty Dumpty\nsaid:  ’they’re not sensible, and they put me out.’",
        "            ’I sent a message to the fish:\n            I told them “This is what I wish.”",
        "            The little fishes of the sea,\n            They sent an answer back to me.",
        "            The little fishes’ answer was\n            “We cannot do it, Sir, because–\"’",
        "  ’I’m afraid I don’t quite understand,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’It gets easier further on,’ Humpty Dumpty replied.",
        "            ’I sent to them again to say\n            “It will be better to obey.”",
        "            The fishes answered with a grin,\n            “Why, what a temper you are in!”",
        "            I told them once, I told them twice:\n            They would not listen to advice.",
        "            I took a kettle large and new,\n            Fit for the deed I had to do.",
        "            My heart went hop, my heart went thump;\n            I filled the kettle at the pump.",
        "            Then some one came to me and said,\n            “The little fishes are in bed.”",
        "            I said to him, I said it plain,\n            “Then you must wake them up again.”",
        "            I said it very loud and clear;\n            I went and shouted in his ear.’",
        "  Humpty Dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he\nrepeated this verse, and Alice thought with a shudder, ’I\nwouldn’t have been the messenger for ANYTHING!’",
        "            ’But he was very stiff and proud;\n            He said “You needn’t shout so loud!”",
        "            And he was very proud and stiff;\n            He said “I’d go and wake them, if–”",
        "            I took a corkscrew from the shelf:\n            I went to wake them up myself.",
        "            And when I found the door was locked,\n            I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked.",
        "            And when I found the door was shut,\n            I tried to turn the handle, but–’",
        "  There was a long pause.",
        "  ’Is that all?’ Alice timidly asked.",
        "  ’That’s all,’ said Humpty Dumpty.  ’Good-bye.’",
        "  This was rather sudden, Alice thought: but, after such a VERY\nstrong hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would\nhardly be civil to stay.  So she got up, and held out her hand.\n’Good-bye, till we meet again!’ she said as cheerfully as she\ncould.",
        "  ’I shouldn’t know you again if we DID meet,’ Humpty Dumpty\nreplied in a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to\nshake; ’you’re so exactly like other people.’",
        "  ’The face is what one goes by, generally,’ Alice remarked in a\nthoughtful tone.",
        "’That’s just what I complain of,’ said Humpty Dumpty.  ’Your face\nis the same as everybody has–the two eyes, so–’ (marking their\nplaces in the air with this thumb) ’nose in the middle, mouth\nunder.  It’s always the same.  Now if you had the two eyes on the\nsame side of the nose, for instance–or the mouth at the top–that\nwould be SOME help.’",
        "  ’It wouldn’t look nice,’ Alice objected.  But Humpty Dumpty\nonly shut his eyes and said ’Wait till you’ve tried.’",
        "  Alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he\nnever opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said\n’Good-bye!’ once more, and, getting no answer to this, she\nquietly walked away:  but she couldn’t help saying to herself as\nshe went, ’Of all the unsatisfactory–’ (she repeated this\naloud, as it was a great comfort to have such a long word to say)\n’of all the unsatisfactory people I EVER met–’  She never\nfinished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash shook the\nforest from end to end.",
