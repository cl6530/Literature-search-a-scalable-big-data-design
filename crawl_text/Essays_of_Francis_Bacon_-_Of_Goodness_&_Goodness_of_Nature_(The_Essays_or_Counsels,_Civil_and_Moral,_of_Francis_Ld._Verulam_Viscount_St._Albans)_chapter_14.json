        "I TAKE goodness in this sense, the affecting of\nthe weal of men, which is that the Grecians\ncall philanthropia; and the word humanity (as\nit is used) is a little too light to express it.  Goodness I call the habit, and goodness of nature, the\ninclination.  This of all virtues, and dignities of the\nmind, is the greatest; being the character of the\nDeity: and without it, man is a busy, mischievous,\nwretched thing; no better than a kind of vermin.\nGoodness answers to the theological virtue, charity, and admits no excess, but error.  The desire of\npower in excess, caused the angels to fall; the desire\nof knowledge in excess, caused man to fall: but in\ncharity there is no excess; neither can angel, nor\nman, come in dan ger by it.  The inclination to goodness, is imprinted deeply in the nature of man; insomuch, that if it issue not towards men, it will\ntake unto other living creatures; as it is seen in the\nTurks, a cruel people, who nevertheless are kind\nto beasts, and give alms, to dogs and birds; insomuch, as Busbechius reporteth, a Christian boy, in\nConstantinople, had like to have been stoned, for\ngagging in a waggishness a long-billed fowl.\nErrors indeed in this virtue of goodness, or charity,\nmay be committed.  The Italians have an ungracious proverb, Tanto buon che val niente: so\ngood, that he is good for nothing.  And one of\nthe doctors of Italy, Nicholas Machiavel, had\nthe confidence to put in writing, almost in plain\nterms, That the Christian faith, had given up good\nmen, in prey to those that are tyrannical and unjust.  Which he spake, because indeed there was\nnever law, or sect, or opinion, did so much magnify goodness, as the Christian religion doth.\nTherefore, to avoid the scandal and the danger\nboth, it is good, to take knowledge of the errors of\nan habit so excellent.  Seek the good of other men,\nbut be not in bondage to their faces or fancies; for\nthat is but facility, or softness; which taketh an\nhonest mind prisoner.  Neither give thou AEsop’s\ncock a gem, who would be better pleased, and happier, if he had had a barley-corn.  The example of\nGod, teacheth the lesson truly: He sendeth his rain,\nand maketh his sun to shine, upon the just and\nunjust; but he doth not rain wealth, nor shine\nhonor and virtues, upon men equally.  Common\nbenefits, are to be communicate with all; but peculiar benefits, with choice.  And beware how in\nmaking the portraiture, thou breakest the pattern.\nFor divinity, maketh the love of ourselves the pattern; the love of our neighbors, but the portraiture.\nSell all thou hast, and give it to the poor, and follow me: but, sell not all thou hast, except thou\ncome and follow me; that is, except thou have a\nvocation, wherein thou mayest do as much good,\nwith little means as with great; for otherwise, in\nfeeding the streams, thou driest the fountain.\nNeither is there only a habit of goodness, directed\nby right reason; but there is in some men, even in\nnature, a disposition towards it; as on the other\nside, there is a natural malignity.  For there be,\nthat in their nature do not affect the good of others.\nThe lighter sort of malignity, turneth but to a\ncrassness, or frowardness, or aptness to oppose, or\ndifficulties, or the like; but the deeper sort, to envy\nand mere mischief.  Such men, in other men’s calamities, are, as it were, in season, and are ever on\nthe loading part: not so good as the dogs, that licked\nLazarus’ sores; but like flies, that are still buzzing\nupon any thing that is raw; misanthropi, that\nmake it their practice, to bring men to the bough,\nand yet never a tree for the purpose in their gardens, as Timon had.  Such dispositions, are the very\nerrors of human nature; and yet they are the fittest\ntimber, to make great politics of; like to knee timber, that is good for ships, that are ordained to be\ntossed; but not for building houses, that shall stand\nfirm.  The parts and signs of goodness, are many.  If\na man be gracious and courteous to strangers, it\nshows he is a citizen of the world, and that his heart\nis no island, cut off from other lands, but a continent, that joins to them.  If he be compassionate\ntowards the afflictions of others, it shows that his\nheart is like the noble tree, that is wounded itself,\nwhen it gives the balm.  If he easily pardons, and\nremits offences, it shows that his mind is planted\nabove injuries; so that he cannot be shot.  If he be\nthankful for small benefits, it shows that he weighs\nmen’s minds, and not their trash.  But above all, if\nhe have St. Paul’s perfection, that he would wish\nto be anathema from Christ, for the salvation of\nhis brethren, it shows much of a divine nature, and\na kind of conformity with Christ himself",
