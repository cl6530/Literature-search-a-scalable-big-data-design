        "Great writers who spring late and suddenly from obscurity into fame\nand yet die early, must always form more or less perplexing subjects\nof literary biography. The processes of their intellectual and\nartistic growth lie hidden in nameless years; their genius is not\nrevealed to the world until it has reached its full maturity, and many\naspects of it, which, perhaps, would have easily explained themselves\nif the gradual development had gone on before men’s eyes, remain\noften unexplained to the last. By few, if any, of the more celebrated\nEnglish men of letters is this observation so forcibly illustrated as\nit is in the case of Sterne: the obscure period of his life so greatly\nexceeded in duration the brief season of his fame, and its obscurity\nwas so exceptionally profound. He was forty-seven years of age when,\nat a bound, he achieved celebrity; he was not five-and-fifty when he\ndied. And though it might be too much to say that the artist sprang,\nlike the reputation, full-grown into being, it is nevertheless true\nthat there are no marks of positive immaturity to be detected even in\nthe earliest public displays of his art. His work grows, indeed, most\nmarvellously in vividness and symmetry as he proceeds, but there\nare no visible signs of growth in the workman’s skill. Even when the\nhighest point of finish is attained we cannot say that the hand is any\nmore cunning than it was from the first. As well might we say that the\nlast light touches of the sculptor’s chisel upon the perfected statue\nare more skilful than its first vigorous strokes upon the shapeless\nblock.",
        "It is certain, however, that Sterne must have been storing up his\nmaterial of observation, secreting his reflections on life and\ncharacter, and consciously or unconsciously maturing his powers of\nexpression, during the whole of those silent twenty years which have\nnow to be passed under brief review. With one exception, to be noted\npresently, the only known writings of his which belong to this\nperiod are sermons, and these–a mere “scratch” collection of pulpit\ndiscourses, which, as soon as he had gained the public ear, he\nhastened in characteristic fashion to rummage from his desk and carry\nto the book-market–throw no light upon the problem before us. There\nare sermons of Sterne which alike in manner and matter disclose the\nauthor of Tristram Shandy; but they are not among those which he\npreached or wrote before that work was given to the world. They\nare not its ancestors but its descendants. They belong to the\npost-Shandian period, and are in obvious imitation of the Shandian\nstyle; while in none of the earlier ones–not even in that famous\nhomily on a Good Conscience, which did not succeed till Corporal Trim\npreached it before the brothers Shandy and Dr. Slop–can we trace\neither the trick of style or the turn of thought that give piquancy to\nthe novel. Yet the peculiar qualities of mind, and the special faculty\nof workmanship of which this turn of thought and trick of style were\nthe product, must of course have been potentially present from the\nbeginning. Men do not blossom forth as wits, humourists, masterly\ndelineators of character, and skilful performers on a highly-strung\nand carefully-tuned sentimental instrument all at once, after entering\ntheir “forties;” and the only wonder is that a possessor of these\npowers–some of them of the kind which, as a rule, and in most men,\nseeks almost as irresistibly for exercise as even the poetic instinct\nitself–should have been held so long unemployed. There is, however,\none very common stimulus to literary exertions which in Sterne’s case\nwas undoubtedly wanting–a superabundance of unoccupied time. We\nhave little reason, it is true, to suppose that this light-minded\nand valetudinarian Yorkshire parson was at any period of his life an\nindustrious “parish priest;” but it is probable, nevertheless, that\ntime never hung very heavily upon his hands. In addition to the\nfavourite amusements which he enumerates in the Memoir, he was all\nhis days addicted to one which is, perhaps, the most absorbing of\nall–flirtation. Philandering, and especially philandering of the\nPlatonic and ultra-sentimental order, is almost the one human\npastime of which its votaries never seem to tire; and its constant\nministrations to human vanity may serve, perhaps, to account for their\nunwearied absorption in its pursuit. Sterne’s first love affair–an\naffair of which, unfortunately, the consequences were more lasting\nthan the passion–took place immediately upon his leaving Cambridge.\nTo relate it as he relates it to his daughter: “At York I became\nacquainted with your mother, and courted her for two years. She owned\nshe liked me, but thought herself not rich enough or me too poor to\nbe joined together. She went to her sister’s in Staffordshire, and I\nwrote to her often. I believe then she was partly determined to have\nme, but would not say so. At her return she fell into a consumption,\nand one evening that I was sitting by her, with an almost broken heart\nto see her so ill, she said: ’My dear Laury, I never can be yours, for\nI verily believe I have not long to live! But I have left you every\nshilling of my fortune.’ Upon that she showed me her will. This\ngenerosity overpowered me. It pleased God that she recovered, and we\nwere married in 1741.” The name of this lady was Elizabeth Lumley, and\nit was to her that Sterne addressed those earliest letters which his\ndaughter included in the collection published by her some eight years\nafter her father’s death. They were added, the preface tells us, “in\njustice to Mr. Sterne’s delicate feelings;” and in our modern usage\nof the word “delicate,” as equivalent to infirm of health and probably\nshort of life, they no doubt do full justice to the passion which they\nare supposed to express. It would be unfair, of course, to judge any\nlove-letters of that period by the standard of sincerity applied in\nour own less artificial age. All such compositions seem frigid and\nformal enough to us of to-day; yet in most cases of genuine attachment\nwe usually find at least a sentence here and there in which the\nnatural accents of the heart make themselves heard above the affected\nmodulations of the style. But the letters of Sterne’s courtship\nmaintain the pseudo-poetic, shepherd-and-shepherdess strain\nthroughout; or, if the lover ever abandons it, it is only to make\nsomewhat maudlin record of those “tears” which flowed a little too\neasily at all times throughout his life. These letters, however, have\na certain critical interest in their bearing upon those sensibilities\nwhich Sterne afterwards learned to cultivate in a forcing-frame, with\na view to the application of their produce to the purposes of an\nart of pathetic writing which simulates nature with such admirable\nfidelity at its best, and descends to such singular bathos at its\nworst.",
        "The marriage preluded by this courtship did not take place till\nSterne had already been three years Vicar of Sutton-on-the-Forest, the\nbenefice which had been procured for him by his uncle the Archdeacon;\nthrough whose interest also he was appointed successively to two\nprebends–preferments which were less valuable to him for their\nemolument than for the ecclesiastical status which they conferred upon\nhim, for the excuse which they gave him for periodical visits to the\ncathedral city to fulfil the residential conditions of his offices,\nand for the opportunity thus afforded him of mixing in and studying\nthe society of the Close. Upon his union with Miss Lumley, and, in a\nsomewhat curious fashion, by her means, he obtained in addition the\nliving of Stillington. “A friend of hers in the South had promised her\nthat if she married a clergyman in Yorkshire, when the living became\nvacant he would make her a compliment of it;” and made accordingly\nthis singular “compliment” was. At Sutton Sterne remained nearly\ntwenty years, doing duty at both places, during which time\n“books, painting, fiddling, and shooting were,” he says, “my chief\namusements.” With what success he shot, and with what skill he\nfiddled, we know not. His writings contain not a few musical\nmetaphors and allusions to music, which seem to indicate a competent\nacquaintance with its technicalities; but the specimen of his\npowers as an artist, which Mr. Fitzgerald has reproduced from his\nillustrations of a volume of poems by Mr. Woodhull, does not dispose\none to rate highly his proficiency in this accomplishment. We may\nexpect that, after all, it was the first-mentioned of his amusements\nin which he took the greatest delight, and that neither the brush,\nthe bow, nor the fowling-piece was nearly so often in his hand as\nthe book. Within a few miles of Sutton, at Skelton Castle, an almost\nunique Roman stronghold, since modernized by Gothic hands, dwelt\nhis college-friend John Hall Stevenson, whose well-stocked library\ncontained a choice but heterogeneous collection of books–old French\n“ana,” and the learning of mediaeval doctors–books intentionally and\nbooks unintentionally comic, the former of which Sterne read with an\nonly too retentive a memory for their jests, and the latter with an\nacutely humorous appreciation of their solemn trifling. Later on it\nwill be time to note the extent to which he utilized these results of\nhis widely discursive reading, and to examine the legitimacy of the\nmode in which he used them: here it is enough to say generally that\nthe materials for many a burlesque chapter of Tristram Shandy must\nhave been unconsciously storing themselves in his mind in many an\namused hour passed by Sterne in the library of Skelton Castle.",
        "But before finally quitting this part of my subject it may be as well,\nperhaps, to deal somewhat at length with a matter which will doubtless\nhave to be many times incidentally referred to in the course of this\nstudy, but which I now hope to relieve myself from the necessity of\ndoing more than touch upon hereafter. I refer of course to Sterne’s\nperpetually recurring flirtations. This is a matter almost as\nimpossible to omit from any biography of Sterne as it would be to omit\nit from any biography of Goethe. The English humourist did not, it\nis true, engage in the pastime in the serious, not to say scientific,\nspirit of the German philosopher-poet; it was not deliberately made by\nthe former as by the latter to contribute to his artistic development;\nbut it is nevertheless hardly open to doubt that Sterne’s philandering\npropensities did exercise an influence upon his literary character and\nwork in more ways than one. That his marriage was an ill-assorted and\nunhappy union was hardly so much the cause of his inconstancy as its\neffect. It may well be, of course, that the “dear L.,” whose moral and\nmental graces her lover had celebrated in such superfine, sentimental\nfashion, was a commonplace person enough. That she was really a woman\nof the exquisite stolidity of Mrs. Shandy, and that her exasperating\nfeats as an assentatrix did, as has been suggested, supply the model\nfor the irresistibly ludicrous colloquies between the philosopher\nand his wife, there is no sufficient warrant for believing. But it\nis quite possible that the daily companion of one of the most\nindefatigable jesters that ever lived may have been unable to see\na joke; that she regarded her husband’s wilder drolleries as mere\nhorse-collar grimacing, and that the point of his subtler humour\nescaped her altogether. But even if it were so, it is, to say the\nleast of it, doubtful whether Sterne suffered at all on this ground\nfrom the wounded feelings of the mari incompris, while it is next to\ncertain that it does not need the sting of any such disappointment\nto account for his alienation. He must have had plenty of time and\nopportunity to discover Miss Lumley’s intellectual limitations during\nthe two years of his courtship; and it is not likely that, even if\nthey were as well marked as Mrs. Shandy’s own, they would have\ndone much of themselves to estrange the couple. Sympathy is not the\nnecessity to the humourist which the poet finds, or imagines, it to be\nto himself: the humourist, indeed, will sometimes contrive to extract\nfrom the very absence of sympathy in those about him a keener relish\nfor his reflections. With sentiment, indeed, and still more with\nsentimentalism, the case would of course be different; but as for Mr.\nSterne’s demands for sympathy in that department of his life and art,\none may say without the least hesitation that they would have been\nbeyond the power of any one woman, however distinguished a disciple of\nthe “Laura Matilda” school, to satisfy. “I must ever,” he frankly\nsays in one of the “Yorick to Eliza” letters, “I must ever have some\nDulcinea in my head: it harmonizes the soul;” and he might have added\nthat he found it impossible to sustain the harmony without frequently\nchanging the Dulcinea. One may suspect that Mrs. Sterne soon had cause\nfor jealousy, and it is at least certain that several years before\nSterne’s emergence into notoriety their estrangement was complete. One\ndaughter was born to them in 1745, but lived scarcely mare than long\nenough to be rescued from the limbus infantium by the prompt\nrites of the Church. The child was christened Lydia, and died on the\nfollowing day. Its place was filled in 1747 by a second daughter, also\nchristened Lydia, who lived to become the wife of M. de Medalle, and\nthe not very judicious editress of the posthumous “Letters.” For\nher as she grew up Sterne conceived a genuine and truly fatherly\naffection, and it is in writing to her and of her that we see him at\nhis best; or rather one might say it is almost only then that we can\ndistinguish the true notes of the heart through that habitual falsetto\nof sentimentalism which distinguishes most of Sterne’s communications\nwith the other sex. There was no subsequent issue of the marriage,\nand, from one of the letters most indiscreetly included in Madame de\nMedalle’s collection, it is to be ascertained that some four years or\nso after Lydia’s birth the relations between Sterne and Mrs. Sterne\nceased to be conjugal, and never again resumed that character.",
        "It is, however, probable, upon the husband’s own confessions, that he\nhad given his wife earlier cause for jealousy, and certainly from the\ntime when he begins to reveal himself in correspondence there seems to\nbe hardly a moment when some such cause was not in existence–in the\nperson of this, that, or the other lackadaisical damsel or coquettish\nmatron. From Miss Fourmantelle, the “dear, dear Kitty,” to whom Sterne\nwas making violent love in 1759, the year of the York publication\nof Tristram Shandy, down to Mrs. Draper, the heroine of the famous\n“Yorick to Eliza” letters, the list of ladies who seem to have kindled\nflames in that susceptible breast is almost as long and more real\nthan the roll of mistresses immortalized by Horace. How Mrs. Sterne at\nfirst bore herself under her husband’s ostentatious neglect there\nis no direct evidence to show. That she ultimately took refuge in\nindifference we can perceive, but it is to be feared that she was not\nalways able to maintain the attitude of contemptuous composure. So, at\nleast, we may suspect from the evidence of that Frenchman who met\n“le bon et agréable Tristram,” and his wife, at Montpellier, and who,\ncharacteristically sympathizing with the inconstant husband, declared\nthat his wife’s incessant pursuit of him made him pass “d’assez\nmauvais moments,” which he bore “with the patience of an angel.\"\nBut, on the whole, Mrs. Sterne’s conduct seems by her husband’s own\nadmissions to have been not wanting in dignity.",
        "As to the nature of Sterne’s love-affairs I have come, though not\nwithout hesitation, to the conclusion that they were most, if not all\nof them, what is called, somewhat absurdly, Platonic. In saying this,\nhowever, I am by no means prepared to assert that they would all of\nthem have passed muster before a prosaic and unsentimental British\njury as mere indiscretions, and nothing worse. Sterne’s relations\nwith Miss Fourmantelle, for instance, assumed at last a profoundly\ncompromising character, and it is far from improbable that the worst\nconstruction would have been put upon them by one of the plain-dealing\ntribunals aforesaid. Certainly a young woman who leaves her mother at\nYork, and comes up to London to reside alone in lodgings, where she is\nconstantly being visited by a lover who is himself living en garçonin the metropolis, can hardly complain if her imprudence is fatal to\nher reputation; neither can he if his own suffers in the same way.\nBut, as I am not of those who hold that the conventionally “innocent\"\nis the equivalent of the morally harmless in this matter, I cannot\nregard the question as worth any very minute investigation. I am\nnot sure that the habitual male flirt, who neglects his wife to sit\ncontinually languishing at the feet of some other woman, gives much\nless pain and scandal to others, or does much less mischief to himself\nand the objects of his adoration, than the thorough-going profligate;\nand I even feel tempted to risk the apparent paradox that, from\nthe artistic point of view, Sterne lost rather than gained by the\ngenerally Platonic character of his amours. For, as it was, the\nrestraint of one instinct of his nature implied the over-indulgence\nof another which stood in at least as much need of chastenment. If his\nlove-affairs stopped short of the gratification of the senses, they\ninvolved a perpetual fondling and caressing of those effeminate\nsensibilities of his into that condition of hyper-aesthesia which,\nthough Sterne regarded it as the strength, was in reality the\nweakness, of his art.",
        "Injurious, however, as was the effect which Sterne’s philanderings\nexercised upon his personal and literary character, it is not likely\nthat, at least at this period of his life at Sutton, they had in any\ndegree compromised his reputation. For this he had provided in\nother ways, and principally by his exceedingly injudicious choice\nof associates. “As to the squire of the parish,” he remarks in the\nMemoir, “I cannot say we were on a very friendly footing, but at\nStillington the family of the C[rofts] showed us every kindness: ’twas\nmost agreeable to be within a mile and a half of an amiable family who\nwere ever cordial friends;” and who, it may be added, appear to have\nbeen Sterne’s only reputable acquaintances. For the satisfaction of\nall other social needs he seems to have resorted to a companionship\nwhich it was hardly possible for a clergyman to frequent without\nscandal–that, namely, of John Hall Stevenson and the kindred spirits\nwhom he delighted to collect around him at Skelton–familiarly known\nas “Crazy” Castle. The club of the “Demoniacs,” of which Sterne makes\nmention in his letters, may have had nothing very diabolical about it\nexcept the name; but, headed as it was by the suspected ex-comrade\nof Wilkes and his brother monks of Medmenham, and recruited by gay\nmilitaires like Colonels Hall and Lee, and “fast” parsons like the\nRev. “Panty” Lascelles (mock godson of Pantagruel), it was certainly\na society in which the Vicar of Sutton could not expect to enroll\nhimself without offence. We may fairly suppose, therefore, that it\nwas to his association with these somewhat too “jolly companions” that\nSterne owed that disfavour among decorous country circles, of which\nhe shows resentful consciousness in the earlier chapters of Tristram\nShandy.\nBut before we finally cross the line which separates the life of the\nobscure country parson from the life of the famous author, a word or\ntwo must be said of that piece of writing which was alluded to a few\npages back as the only known exception to the generally “professional\"\ncharacter of all Sterne’s compositions of the pre-Shandian era. This\nwas a piece in the allegoric-satirical style, which, though not very\nremarkable in itself, may not improbably have helped to determine its\nauthor’s thoughts in the direction of more elaborate literary efforts.\nIn the year 1758 a dispute had arisen between a certain Dr. Topham, an\necclesiastical lawyer in large local practice, and Dr. Fountayne, the\nthen Dean of York. This dispute had originated in an attempt on the\npart of the learned civilian, who appears to have been a pluralist of\nan exceptionally insatiable order, to obtain the reversion of one of\nhis numerous offices for his son, alleging a promise made to him on\nthat behalf by the Archbishop. This promise–which had, in fact, been\ngiven–was legally impossible of performance, and upon the failure\nof his attempt the disappointed Topham turned upon the Dean, and\nmaintained that by him, at any rate, he had been promised another\nplace of the value of five guineas per annum, and appropriately known\nas the “Commissaryship of Pickering and Pocklington.” This the Dean\ndenied, and thereupon Dr. Topham fired off a pamphlet setting forth\nthe circumstances of the alleged promise, and protesting against the\nwrong inflicted upon him by its non-performance. At this point Sterne\ncame to Dr. Fountayne’s assistance with a sarcastic apologue entitled\nthe “History of a good Warm Watchcoat,” which had “hung up many years\nin the parish vestry,” and showing how this garment had so excited\nthe cupidity of Trim, the sexton, that “nothing would serve him but\nhe must take it home, to have it converted into a warm under-petticoat\nfor his wife and a jerkin for himself against the winter.” The\nsymbolization of Dr. Topham’s snug “patent place,” which he wished\nto make hereditary, under the image of the good warm watchcoat, is of\ncourse plain enough; and there is some humour in the way in which the\nparson (the Archbishop) discovers that his incautious assent to Trim’s\nrequest had been given ultra vires. Looking through the parish\nregister, at the request of a labourer who wished to ascertain his\nage, the parson finds express words of bequest leaving the watch-coat\n“for the sole use of the sextons of the church for ever, to be worn by\nthem respectively on winterly cold nights,” and at the moment when he\nis exclaiming, “Just Heaven! what an escape have I had! Give this\nfor a petticoat to Trim’s wife!” he is interrupted by Trim himself\nentering the vestry with “the coat actually ript and cut out” ready\nfor conversion into a petticoat for his wife. And we get a foretaste\nof the familiar Shandian impertinence in the remark which follows,\nthat “there are many good similes subsisting in the world, but which I\nhave neither time to recollect nor look for,” which would give you an\nidea of the parson’s astonishment at Trim’s impudence. The emoluments\nof “Pickering and Pocklington” appear under the figure of a “pair of\nblack velvet plush breeches” which ultimately “got into the possession\nof one Lorry Slim (Sterne himself, of course), an unlucky wight, by\nwhom they are still worn: in truth, as you will guess, they are very\nthin by this time.”",
        "The whole thing is the very slightest of “skits;” and the quarrel\nhaving been accommodated before it could be published, it was\nnot given to the world until after its author’s death. But it is\ninteresting, as his first known attempt in this line of composition,\nand the grasping sexton deserves remembrance, if only as having handed\ndown his name to a far more famous descendant.",
