        "When I awoke the next morning I found Bernibus and Wagner conversing\nquietly in the corner of my bed chambers, and as I first opened my eyes\nI saw Wagner looking at me with a blank, glazed expression, while\nBernibus’ was one of apprehension, apparently on my behalf. It seemed\nodd to me, but as Wagner became livid again quickly after his split-\nsecond lapse and gave me a hearty “Good morning”, I thought nothing more\nof it. After his greeting, he continued:",
        "“The day is ripe for victory, my friend, and the time is come for\nbattle. We both have some preparations to complete, and so must\nseparate, but we will meet again at noon in the entrance hall. Farewell\nuntil then,” and with that he quit the room.",
        "I looked at Bernibus, yet before either of us could speak, we heard a\nlow, hollow grumbling, like the shaking of some building or foundation.\nHe looked in my direction for a moment with an alarmed countenance,\nbefore I said defensively, “Tis but my stomach.”",
        "“Then we must get you some victuals,” he laughed, “And I have just the\nthing to satisfy you and keep you so for a day or more: some mirus. It\nis our traditional energy food, for though its taste is bitter, its\nafter-life is pleasant.”",
        "“And what is food except a servant to the body?” I said, “Let us eat.”",
        "“Very well,” he replied.",
        "And eat we did, for it was brought by a food service Canitaur on a tray,\nand I was surprised to see that it was a mixture of broccoli, spinach,\nand mushrooms, with a flavorless, glowing sauce. He was right,\nincidentally, for it was both bitter before and pleasant after its\nconsumption.",
        "“I know of the solids, but what is this sauce?” I asked of him.",
        "“Carbon” he replied.",
        "I looked at him and questioned, “Pure carbon? I have never heard of its\nhaving this use before.”",
        "“Your civilization was long ago and had not developed it yet.”",
        "“That has perplexed me, now that you mention it,” I said, “Onan seemed\nto mean that I was going back in time to help my ancestors, but you say\nthat I went forward, that I am one of the ancients.”",
        "He was wary for a moment, though if it was because of the apparent\nconflict, or because I was on a first name basis with his god I couldn’t\ntell. He soon recovered his countenance and said, “It is a complicated\nquestion, and I believe you should ask Wagner the next time you see him,\nafter the raid though, of course. The time of departure is nigh now,\nhowever, so you should put on your anti-electron suit,” he said as he\npicked it up from the corner and brought it to me.",
        "It was a subtle dark brown and looked more like a normal suit of clothes\nthan an electron reflecting suit, but then again, I thought, why would\nit be a strange looking apparatus? Why would an advanced technological\nage necessarily be devoid of any sense of fashion, although that would\nbe assuming that any civilization had ever had one. Fashion is more a\ncharacterization of a culture than a basic and unchanging principle, for\na desert people would wear clothes that would be most uncomfortable to a\npeople who lived in the snow. Clothes may not make the man, but the man\ncertainly makes the clothes, and you can judge a person by what they\nwear so far as it is in their power to decide what that is.",
        "After putting on the suit I found that it fit perfectly, and above that,\nI found it to be very comfortable, including the head piece, which\nformed closely around the skull and was not at all noticeable or\nobscuring. In fact, as it was made of a plasma that allowed everything\nthrough except lone particles, it was so uninhibiting that a moment\nafter I had put mine on I had completely forgotten about it. The only\nother part of the suit that stood out at all was the long, metallic\nbuckle that secured the belt, it having a bowie knife hidden within it\nin an unnoticeable and inconspicuous manner. Bernibus had put on his as\nI had put on mine, and as I looked away from the mirror that was\nopposite the door, I saw him dressed the same as myself, yet because the\nsuit so blended with his fur, it was hard to tell which ended where.",
        "Finding that we were both ready, we repaired to the entrance hall. Along\nthe way I asked Bernibus of his wife, Wagner’s sister, of whom I had\nheard little and seen nothing. He was quiet for a pause, and then said:",
        "“She was an angel, what else can be said?”",
        "“Was?” I asked hesitantly.",
        "“Yes, she was killed by the Zards on a border raid, as we were at that\ntime living apart from the Canitaur mass with a few friends. She was\nless aggressive than her brother, and, much to his disapprobation, we\nlived with a group of separatists, believing that war, physical\nconflict, is never the right answer to ideological conflict. Wagner\nexcommunicated us in his anger, though his sister was very dear to him,\nand after she died he was struck with remorse and made me his deputy\nKibitzer. He felt that it would somehow do her honor, as it would\nrecognize us as having been married and make me his brother-in-law,\nwhich is an important relationship traditionally, as he has no other\nsiblings. So here I am, technically second-in-command, but because of my\nsoft lining, I have no real command.”",
        "“You would not attack Nunami, then?” I asked.",
        "He chose his words carefully, saying, “More pain will not negate the\npain already in existence, yet war is not always avoidable, and\nsometimes it is even necessary.”",
        "When we reached the entrance hall, where the raiding party was to meet,\nwe found that there was already assembled a majority of the force,\nincluding Wagner. The party was only twenty strong, as the atomic\nanionizers were to do the main work and the planned raid required\nstealth and secrecy, not force or might. Within a quarter of an hour all\nthe stragglers had arrived and all the anionizers were accounted for, so\nWagner gave a short debriefing to ensure that all the members were on\nthe same page. We were to sneak into the city when the populous was\ndistracted by the fire on Lake Umquam Renatusum, which was to be started\nat midnight. We would plant the atomic anionizers at the right spacing\nso as to bring down the whole city once we were escaped, using the\nremote control provided for that very purpose. The suits would protect\nus from the blasts, and, as a precaution, the remote had an automatic\nfive second delay between being pressed and exploding the bombs, though\nit was more for form than practicality. After he finished we set off,\nbeing arranged two abreast per row, there being ten rows. Bernibus and\nmyself were partners, for we had become close friends in the few days\nthat I had spent among the Canitaurs, while Wagner was once again the\nleading guide and Taurus the rearguard.",
        "After crossing the chasm that separated the hall and the entrance\ntunnel, we came to the long defile that formed the latter and passed\nthrough it swiftly, the lofty archer guards remaining as stern and\nimmovable as when I had first come through. We then came to the winding\nstairs that occupied the hollowed innards of a massive and ancient tree,\nof which kind many were to be found in Daem, being at least fifty feet\nthick and 700 feet high, such gigantic trees that were never seen\nelsewhere, yet constituted the whole forests of the northern lands. I\nfound that the stairs were as long as I had remembered, taking us a\ngreat while to ascend to the top of the tree, and when we had made it,\nwe, especially myself, were dazzled by the effulgent light of midday.\nAfter having been out of the sun’s reach for the last few days I was\ncompletely unprepared, though the shock helped me by curing me of the\ndisillusionment that comes from not seeing sun, moon, or stars for any\nlength of time. Taking a rest for a few moments on the seats on the\nplatform, we collected our strength. After our brief repose was\ncompleted, we set off again with renewed vigor across the treeway on\nwhich I had first come to the Canitaur’s fortress. You will remember\nthat the road was made by the securing of five or six foot platforms to\nthe intertwined branches of those great trees, over which one could\ntravel with ease and be safe from exposure to those below by the thick\nfoliage that grew on the trees and was carefully manicured for that very\npurpose.",
        "Soon we reached the first platform I had seen, which we had come upon\nfrom below, but we did not descend there, instead keeping on by the\ntreeway in the direction from which we had come that night, that being\nsouthward, towards the lake, the savanna, and the Zardovian capital,\nNunami. The air was warm, with a slight breeze as we went along, and\nthat, mixed with the plentiful flora about us and the songs of the\ntreetop dwellers, rendered the whole feeling of the walk peaceful and\nhappy, though its end was not to be such. I soon forgot the worldly\nconcerns that plagued me as I was soaking in the simplicity of nature,\nnot a simplicity of form, for all things are incomprehensively complex,\nbut simplicity of meaning.",
        "After a time I began noticing changes in our surroundings that indicated\nwe were drawing nearer to our goal, namely, the trees lessening in\nproportions, the terrain becoming flatter, and the air growing moister\nand more vibrant. Still, the trees continued to spring up from the\nground like great earthen tentacles, for while their size diminished, it\nwas not by enough to change their demeanor, the trees anywhere on Daem\nbeing great in size.",
        "The sun journeyed with us, and by the time we reached Lake Umquam\nRenatusum, twilight’s last agony was being performed in the heavenly\ntheater, and the rippling waters mirrored it, adding only a strange,\nflowing texture. The lake’s current caught my eye with its subtle\noddity, for it was amiss and it appeared upon close inspection that\nthere was an undertow, as if there was an underground river flowing into\nthe lake and bringing about its swirling currents.",
        "Bernibus saw me looking down at the waters from the lofty road with a\npuzzled look, and asked me if I was wondering about the water’s current.\nI replied that I was, and he told me that it was the fervidus flamma\nbeing pumped into the lake through the underground aqueducts, which, of\ncourse, was for the purpose of igniting it to decoy for our raid. Once\nit was explained it made sense, yet I looked at it anyway, for it was\nstill a gorgeous and inspiring view.",
        "We were moving quickly, however, and it soon was out of sight, and I\nagain turned towards our destination with apprehensions of failure. They\nseemed to place great faith in my presence, as the emissary of Onan, and\nwhile I was, I was also Jehu, and I wasn’t confident with my own\nabilities. But it was upon those the situation mostly rested, it being\nthe resolve of the gods after the Homeric period to take a more removed\nrole in the lives of men. I wonder how many from my own times were\ndivine agents, for better or worse. Either way, my main concern then was\nmaking the correct decisions, for I rightly believed that my involvement\nwould decide the matter, although not in the manner I had anticipated.\nAs I looked about myself to reconnoiter the feelings of my comrades I\nwas fruitless, for they all wore impermeable countenances, though that\nwas itself an indicator of their resolve.",
        "Within an hour after the fall of darkness we reached the outskirts of\nNunami, or rather, its edge, for it was walled in with massive stone\nwalls and battlements, with a sturdy gate of twenty foot width being\nplaced at the northern, southern, eastern, and western ends. The trees\nhung right over the walls, and as such we were able to take positions\nfrom which we could descend into the city when the time to do so came.\nYet we were still rendered invisible by the thick foliage.",
        "Night’s zenith blew in slowly on the wind like the belabored breaths of\na dying man, and after a period of worry, it came: midnight, the\nappointed hour. No sooner had the moon reached its utmost height,\nshrouding the lands in a shadowless vortex, than a great blaze erupted\nfrom the northern lands, and it rose almost instantly to its estimated\nheight of five miles. It was a terrible sight to behold, for any flame\nis a captivating display of inorganic life, but a pillar of flame\nseveral miles high is more than just an enlarged specimen, for it plays\nhost to a great horde of phantasmal apparitions that wrestle ferociously\nwith one another. As the flame shot upwards it cast a great light down\non everything that rivaled the illumination of midday. At first I feared\nlest the light should show our silhouettes to the Zards, as we were\nbetween them and it, but it did not, or at least they took no notice of\nit if it did, for we were quite undetected in our hiding place.",
        "Our worries were far from over though, for now came the crucial point in\nour plans: in order for our small force to infiltrate the city and place\nthe atomic anionizers, the Zards must not only have been distracted and\npreoccupied with the blaze, but they had also to leave the city almost\nempty and go to the lake itself, for if a cry was raised, or any\nsubstantial resistance attempted, the complex procedures to detonate the\nanionizers properly, so as to level the city but not the surrounding\ncountry, may have been hindered. There were several factors on our side\nthough, the element of surprise being the foremost, for in their\nexcitement the Zardovian resistance would likely mistake us for a\nregular sized army and flee in fear at our supposed superiority,\nespecially since the presence of me, the kinsman redeemer, was known to\nthe Zards. Also, the Zards were known to be curious and careless and\nruled by the desire for excitement, meaning that if an entertaining\nundertaking was possible, they would pursue it, no matter how dangerous\nor ill-advised.",
        "Within a moment after the flame was lit, all of the Zards outside, which\nwere many, were gazing with silent wonder at it, and in the second\nmoment, all the rest had joined them in their confused contemplation.\nBut the third moment witnessed a drastic change in their behavior, for\ntheir initial bewilderment wore off and suddenly, with a united prelude\nof the drawing in of a breath, they all began speaking at once,\nresulting in a clamorous din that lasted for a few moments, before\nthings hushed again and we could hear a few individual voices discussing\nloudly. Though we couldn’t make out their exact words, they were\napparently conferring with one another about what action to take. Our\nbreathing became slow and heavy and our brows were knit tensely, for we\nknew that the fate of our mission rested on what they did then, whether\nor not the long planned decoy would work.",
        "It was an anxious moment, and one with a heavy burden attached to it.\nFortunately, though, as our fate was decided, it was done so in our\nfavor, for the Zards began exiting the city in a great multitude of\nscales that swept along the savanna like a tidal wave over a sandy\ncoast. They came out fast and strong, and through each of the four\ngates, though only the northern was fully visible to us, the others\nbeing too far to be seen distinctly. Still, we could see them rushing\nout of Nunami at a quick pace, not hurried, as if frightened or finicky,\nnor slow as in deliberation and meditation, instead it was a steady trot\nthat they took, allowing them to move safely and swiftly.",
        "The tide of Zards swept steadily past us, and it was a good half an hour\nlater that the final ones had left the gates and the city far behind.\nMost had taken some type of weapon, a pitchfork or club or occasionally\na sword, for the threat of war was a constant, but none of them had any\nidea that their only danger was behind them. It was not all in the clear\nthough, for a patrol of guards equipped with long spears and clothed\nwith a tough, leathery armor were making their way to and fro along the\ntops of the walls, where there was a platform of about five feet across\nthat served as a road to the soldiers in their watches. It was evident\nby their countenances, though, that the guards now on duty were more\ninterested in the fire than in their immediate vicinity, thinking, no\ndoubt, that the laurels were to be won there and not at Nunami, and as\nsuch, they paid little heed to the walls, instead walking with their\nnecks craned precariously to the north.",
        "We were able to jump unto the wall silently from our concealed roost on\nthe treeway when the nearest patrol had passed by. From there we went\nalong the wall a short way until we came to a battlement, there taking\nthe downward leading steps that brought us to the ground. Once there we\nwere pleased and hopeful at what we saw: everything was abandoned, and\nno Zards were in sight save those on the walls, whose gaze was cast\nelsewhere. We set to work, then, according to our preset plan, which was\nto break up into groups of two and cover the city with our atomic\nanionizers, so as to spread the destruction as evenly as possible.\nWagner and myself were partners, and we took the central district, near\nthe government’s center, the palace, and the Temple of Time, which rose\nabove the city like a great tree amidst a desert. It was, in fact, the\nvery structure that had so stood out to me during my journey through the\nprairie upon my arrival, and once again its sobering sensation struck\nme, and I found myself staring up at its top, a full 800 feet high, the\nbottom being an ornate and elaborate temple. The middle, which supplied\nmost of its height, was a long, round tower, and at top there was a\nspherical pinnacle which had what looked to be a room in it.",
        "Wagner soon called my attention back to our work, and we busied\nourselves with planting a bomb at the base of the palace, using a\nsmaller type anionizer, which, I noticed, was set just right so that\nwhile all of Nunami would be leveled, the temple with its great tower\nwould be beyond the impact and left standing. Just as we had set it\ncorrectly, we heard a high-pitched whistle, which was the preconcerted\nsignal among the raiders to use if any danger was nigh. We looked up\ndirectly and saw its reason: a squadron of Zards had been garrisoned\ninside the palace and had not left like the others, apparently because\nits sole purpose was to protect their king, who did not leave the city,\nbeing preoccupied with business and not seeing the flames. When he did\ngo to the window, he saw the fire, and rushed to see what was about, but\ninstead of finding out, he ran into us, who were right outside the\npalace.",
        "Wagner dashed wildly through the streets in an impressive show of\ndexterity, and did a wall-jump between two lofty buildings to gain the\nwall. The others had done likewise, having been trained by a lifetime of\nconflict to have nerves of lightning speed and earthly strength. Their\ninstincts had come in subconsciously when they had seen the cause of the\nalarm and they escaped, without thinking of me in the critical moment. I\nlacked such strength and speed of mind and was caught as soon as I had\nseen the squadron, aided, probably, by the fact that upon seeing me the\nking had become excited and rushed at me with great speed. When Wagner\nhad first turned around and saw me their prisoner, he looked crestfallen\nand hopeless, for he had no way to rescue me. He held the remote control\nfor the atomic anionizers in his hand and was about to set them off and\nmake good the plan, but before he could, our eyes met for an instant,\nand we connected beyond time and space, experiencing a strange intra-\npersonal deja vu. All was silent and still in that instant, and I saw\nhim struggling inwardly: would he detonate the anionizers and make good\nhis long awaited plan, or would he retreat and leave the city unharmed,\nfor though I was wearing the electron reflecting suit, the collapse of\nall the high rise buildings would litter the ground with debris from\nthem, and all on the ground would be crushed. Would he spare me from\ndeath, or his people? In that instant his face spoke more than many\nothers’ do in their entire lifetime. It was cut through with a\ncontrasting countenance, and yet inside of his eyes there was something\nforeign to them shining through, something that I had never seen on his\nfretless features before: evil intent. I could not tell if it was\nnatural to them and simply well hidden, or if it was an alien\nexpression, but it was fearfully expressed, and his eyes seemed to say,\neven at that great distance, that he took a third course, that he would\nsave me, but not for my sake, instead for his peoples’. And then it\npassed, for he looked away, replaced the remote to his belt, and leapt\nto the ground, where the other Canitaurs were awaiting him. I saw him no\nmore until the situation was much changed.",
