        "One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a\nluxurious arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry’s house in\nCurzon Street.  It was, in its way, a very charming room, with its\nhigh panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-colored\nfrieze and ceiling of raised plaster-work, and its brick-dust felt\ncarpet strewn with long-fringed silk Persian rugs.  On a tiny\nsatinwood table stood a statuette by Clodion, and beside it lay a\ncopy of “Les Cent Nouvelles,” bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis\nEve, and powdered with the gilt daisies that the queen had selected\nfor her device.  Some large blue china jars, filled with parrot-\ntulips, were ranged on the mantel-shelf, and through the small leaded\npanes of the window streamed the apricot-colored light of a summer’s\nday in London.",
        "Lord Henry had not come in yet.  He was always late on principle, his\nprinciple being that punctuality is the thief of time.  So the lad\nwas looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the\npages of an elaborately-illustrated edition of “Manon Lescaut” that\nhe had found in one of the bookcases.  The formal monotonous ticking\nof the Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him.  Once or twice he thought of\ngoing away.",
        "At last he heard a light step outside, and the door opened.  “How\nlate you are, Harry!” he murmured.",
        "“I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,” said a woman’s voice.",
        "He glanced quickly round, and rose to his feet.  “I beg your pardon.\nI thought–”",
        "“You thought it was my husband.  It is only his wife.  You must let\nme introduce myself.  I know you quite well by your photographs.  I\nthink my husband has got twenty-seven of them.”",
        "[23] “Not twenty-seven, Lady Henry?”",
        "“Well, twenty-six, then.  And I saw you with him the other night at\nthe Opera.”  She laughed nervously, as she spoke, and watched him\nwith her vague forget-me-not eyes.  She was a curious woman, whose\ndresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put\non in a tempest.  She was always in love with somebody, and, as her\npassion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions.  She\ntried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy.  Her\nname was Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to church.",
        "“That was at ’Lohengrin,’ Lady Henry, I think?”",
        "“Yes; it was at dear ’Lohengrin.’  I like Wagner’s music better than\nany other music.  It is so loud that one can talk the whole time,\nwithout people hearing what one says.  That is a great advantage:\ndon’t you think so, Mr. Gray?”",
        "The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her\nfingers began to play with a long paper-knife.",
        "Dorian smiled, and shook his head: “I am afraid I don’t think so,\nLady Henry.  I never talk during music,–at least during good music.\nIf one hears bad music, it is one’s duty to drown it by\nconversation.”",
        "“Ah! that is one of Harry’s views, isn’t it, Mr. Gray?  But you must\nnot think I don’t like good music.  I adore it, but I am afraid of\nit.  It makes me too romantic.  I have simply worshipped pianists,–\ntwo at a time, sometimes.  I don’t know what it is about them.\nPerhaps it is that they are foreigners.  They all are, aren’t they?\nEven those that are born in England become foreigners after a time,\ndon’t they?  It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to art.\nMakes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn’t it?  You have never been to any\nof my parties, have you, Mr. Gray?  You must come.  I can’t afford\norchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners.  They make one’s rooms\nlook so picturesque.  But here is Harry!–Harry, I came in to look\nfor you, to ask you something,–I forget what it was,–and I found\nMr. Gray here.  We have had such a pleasant chat about music.  We\nhave quite the same views.  No; I think our views are quite\ndifferent.  But he has been most pleasant.  I am so glad I’ve seen\nhim.”",
        "“I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,” said Lord Henry, elevating\nhis dark crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an\namused smile.–\"So sorry I am late, Dorian.  I went to look after a\npiece of old brocade in Wardour Street, and had to bargain for hours\nfor it.  Nowadays people know the price of everything, and the value\nof nothing.”",
        "“I am afraid I must be going,” exclaimed Lady Henry, after an awkward\nsilence, with her silly sudden laugh.  “I have promised to drive with\nthe duchess.–Good-by, Mr. Gray.–Good-by, Harry.  You are dining\nout, I suppose?  So am I.  Perhaps I shall see you at Lady\nThornbury’s.”",
        "“I dare say, my dear,” said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her,\nas she flitted out of the room, looking like a bird-of-paradise that\nhad been out in the rain, and leaving a faint odor of patchouli\nbehind her.  Then he shook hands with Dorian Gray, lit a cigarette,\nand flung himself down on the sofa.",
        "[24] “Never marry a woman with straw-colored hair, Dorian,” he said,\nafter a few puffs.",
        "“Why, Harry?”",
        "“Because they are so sentimental.”",
        "“But I like sentimental people.”",
        "“Never marry at all, Dorian.  Men marry because they are tired;\nwomen, because they are curious: both are disappointed.”",
        "“I don’t think I am likely to marry, Harry.  I am too much in love.\nThat is one of your aphorisms.  I am putting it into practice, as I\ndo everything you say.”",
        "“Whom are you in love with?” said Lord Henry, looking at him with a\ncurious smile.",
        "“With an actress,” said Dorian Gray, blushing.",
        "Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  “That is a rather common-place\ndébut,” he murmured.",
        "“You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.”",
        "“Who is she?”",
        "“Her name is Sibyl Vane.”",
        "“Never heard of her.”",
        "“No one has.  People will some day, however.  She is a genius.”",
        "“My dear boy, no woman is a genius: women are a decorative sex.  They\nnever have anything to say, but they say it charmingly.  They\nrepresent the triumph of matter over mind, just as we men represent\nthe triumph of mind over morals.  There are only two kinds of women,\nthe plain and the colored.  The plain women are very useful.  If you\nwant to gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take\nthem down to supper.  The other women are very charming.  They commit\none mistake, however.  They paint in order to try to look young.  Our\ngrandmothers painted in order to try to talk brilliantly.  Rouge and\nesprit used to go together.  That has all gone out now.  As long as a\nwoman can look ten years younger than her own daughter, she is\nperfectly satisfied.  As for conversation, there are only five women\nin London worth talking to, and two of these can’t be admitted into\ndecent society.  However, tell me about your genius.  How long have\nyou known her?”",
        "“About three weeks.  Not so much.  About two weeks and two days.”",
        "“How did you come across her?”",
        "“I will tell you, Harry; but you mustn’t be unsympathetic about it.\nAfter all, it never would have happened if I had not met you.  You\nfilled me with a wild desire to know everything about life.  For days\nafter I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins.  As I lounged\nin the Park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one\nwho passed me, and wonder with a mad curiosity what sort of lives\nthey led.  Some of them fascinated me.  Others filled me with terror.\nThere was an exquisite poison in the air.  I had a passion for\nsensations.",
        "“One evening about seven o’clock I determined to go out in search of\nsome adventure.  I felt that this gray, monstrous London of ours,\nwith its myriads of people, its splendid sinners, and its sordid\nsins, as [25] you once said, must have something in store for me.  I\nfancied a thousand things.",
        "“The mere danger gave me a sense of delight.  I remembered what you\nhad said to me on that wonderful night when we first dined together,\nabout the search for beauty being the poisonous secret of life.  I\ndon’t know what I expected, but I went out, and wandered eastward,\nsoon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black,\ngrassless squares.  About half-past eight I passed by a little third-\nrate theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills.  A\nhideous Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life,\nwas standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar.  He had greasy\nringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled\nshirt.  ’’Ave a box, my lord?’ he said, when he saw me, and he took\noff his hat with an act of gorgeous servility.  There was something\nabout him, Harry, that amused me.  He was such a monster.  You will\nlaugh at me, I know, but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for\nthe stage-box.  To the present day I can’t make out why I did so; and\nyet if I hadn’t!–my dear Harry, if I hadn’t, I would have missed the\ngreatest romance of my life.  I see you are laughing.  It is horrid\nof you!”",
        "“I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you.  But\nyou should not say the greatest romance of your life.  You should say\nthe first romance of your life.  You will always be loved, and you\nwill always be in love with love.  There are exquisite things in\nstore for you.  This is merely the beginning.”",
        "“Do you think my nature so shallow?” cried Dorian Gray, angrily.",
        "“No; I think your nature so deep.”",
        "“How do you mean?”",
        "“My dear boy, people who only love once in their lives are really\nshallow people.  What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I\ncall either the lethargy of custom or the lack of imagination.\nFaithlessness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the\nintellectual life,–simply a confession of failure.  But I don’t want\nto interrupt you.  Go on with your story.”",
        "“Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a\nvulgar drop-scene staring me in the face.  I looked out behind the\ncurtain, and surveyed the house.  It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids\nand cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake.  The gallery and pit\nwere fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty,\nand there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the\ndress-circle.  Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and\nthere was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.”",
        "“It must have been just like the palmy days of the British Drama.”",
        "“Just like, I should fancy, and very horrid.  I began to wonder what\non earth I should do, when I caught sight of the play-bill.  What do\nyou think the play was, Harry?”",
        "“I should think ’The Idiot Boy, or Dumb but Innocent.’  Our fathers\nused to like that sort of piece, I believe.  The longer I live,\nDorian, the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our\nfathers is not good enough for us.  In art, as in politics, les grand\npères ont toujours tort.”",
        "[26] “This play was good enough for us, Harry.  It was ’Romeo and\nJuliet.’  I must admit I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing\nShakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place.  Still, I felt\ninterested, in a sort of way.  At any rate, I determined to wait for\nthe first act.  There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a\nyoung Jew who sat at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but\nat last the drop-scene was drawn up, and the play began.  Romeo was a\nstout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice,\nand a figure like a beer-barrel.  Mercutio was almost as bad.  He was\nplayed by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and\nwas on most familiar terms with the pit.  They were as grotesque as\nthe scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a pantomime of\nfifty years ago.  But Juliet!  Harry, imagine a girl, hardly\nseventeen years of age, with a little flower-like face, a small Greek\nhead with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet\nwells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose.  She was\nthe loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life.  You said to me once\nthat pathos left you unmoved, but that beauty, mere beauty, could\nfill your eyes with tears.  I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see\nthis girl for the mist of tears that came across me.  And her voice,-\n-I never heard such a voice.  It was very low at first, with deep\nmellow notes, that seemed to fall singly upon one’s ear.  Then it\nbecame a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a distant\nhautbois.  In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that\none hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing.  There were\nmoments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins.  You know\nhow a voice can stir one.  Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are\ntwo things that I shall never forget.  When I close my eyes, I hear\nthem, and each of them says something different.  I don’t know which\nto follow.  Why should I not love her?  Harry, I do love her.  She is\neverything to me in life.  Night after night I go to see her play.\nOne evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen.  I\nhave seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison\nfrom her lover’s lips.  I have watched her wandering through the\nforest of Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and\ndainty cap.  She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a\nguilty king, and given him rue to wear, and bitter herbs to taste of.\nShe has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed\nher reed-like throat.  I have seen her in every age and in every\ncostume.  Ordinary women never appeal to one’s imagination.  They are\nlimited to their century.  No glamour ever transfigures them.  One\nknows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets.  One can\nalways find them.  There is no mystery in one of them.  They ride in\nthe Park in the morning, and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon.\nThey have their stereotyped smile, and their fashionable manner.\nThey are quite obvious.  But an actress!  How different an actress\nis!  Why didn’t you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an\nactress?”",
        "“Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.”",
        "“Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.”",
        "“Don’t run down dyed hair and painted faces.  There is an\nextraordinary charm in them, sometimes.”",
        "[27] “I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.”",
        "“You could not have helped telling me, Dorian.  All through your life\nyou will tell me everything you do.”",
        "“Yes, Harry, I believe that is true.  I cannot help telling you\nthings.  You have a curious influence over me.  If I ever did a\ncrime, I would come and confide it to you.  You would understand me.”",
        "“People like you–the wilful sunbeams of life–don’t commit crimes,\nDorian.  But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same.  And\nnow tell me,–reach me the matches, like a good boy: thanks,–tell\nme, what are your relations with Sibyl Vane?”",
        "Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.\n“Harry, Sibyl Vane is sacred!”",
        "“It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,” said\nLord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice.  “But why\nshould you be annoyed?  I suppose she will be yours some day.  When\none is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one\nalways ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls\nromance.  You know her, at any rate, I suppose?”",
        "“Of course I know her.  On the first night I was at the theatre, the\nhorrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over,\nand offered to bring me behind the scenes and introduce me to her.  I\nwas furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for\nhundreds of years, and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in\nVerona.  I think, from his blank look of amazement, that he thought I\nhad taken too much champagne, or something.”",
        "“I am not surprised.”",
        "“I was not surprised either.  Then he asked me if I wrote for any of\nthe newspapers.  I told him I never even read them.  He seemed\nterribly disappointed at that, and confided to me that all the\ndramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him, and that they were\nall to be bought.”",
        "“I believe he was quite right there.  But, on the other hand, most of\nthem are not at all expensive.”",
        "“Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means.  By this time\nthe lights were being put out in the theatre, and I had to go.  He\nwanted me to try some cigars which he strongly recommended.  I\ndeclined.  The next night, of course, I arrived at the theatre again.\nWhen he saw me he made me a low bow, and assured me that I was a\npatron of art.  He was a most offensive brute, though he had an\nextraordinary passion for Shakespeare.  He told me once, with an air\nof pride, that his three bankruptcies were entirely due to the poet,\nwhom he insisted on calling ’The Bard.’  He seemed to think it a\ndistinction.”",
        "“It was a distinction, my dear Dorian,–a great distinction.  But\nwhen did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?”",
        "“The third night.  She had been playing Rosalind.  I could not help\ngoing round.  I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at\nme; at least I fancied that she had.  The old Jew was persistent.  He\nseemed determined to bring me behind, so I consented.  It was curious\nmy not wanting to know her, wasn’t it?”",
        "[28] “No; I don’t think so.”",
        "“My dear Harry, why?”",
        "“I will tell you some other time.  Now I want to know about the\ngirl.”",
        "“Sibyl?  Oh, she was so shy, and so gentle.  There is something of a\nchild about her.  Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I\ntold her what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite\nunconscious of her power.  I think we were both rather nervous.  The\nold Jew stood grinning at the door-way of the dusty greenroom, making\nelaborate speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each\nother like children.  He would insist on calling me ’My Lord,’ so I\nhad to assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind.  She said\nquite simply to me, ’You look more like a prince.’”",
        "“Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.”",
        "“You don’t understand her, Harry.  She regarded me merely as a person\nin a play.  She knows nothing of life.  She lives with her mother, a\nfaded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta\ndressing-wrapper on the first night, and who looks as if she had seen\nbetter days.”",
        "“I know that look.  It always depresses me.”",
        "“The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not\ninterest me.”",
        "“You were quite right.  There is always something infinitely mean\nabout other people’s tragedies.”",
        "“Sibyl is the only thing I care about.  What is it to me where she\ncame from?  From her little head to her little feet, she is\nabsolutely and entirely divine.  I go to see her act every night of\nmy life, and every night she is more marvellous.”",
        "“That is the reason, I suppose, that you will never dine with me now.\nI thought you must have some curious romance on hand.  You have; but\nit is not quite what I expected.”",
        "“My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have\nbeen to the Opera with you several times.”",
        "“You always come dreadfully late.”",
        "“Well, I can’t help going to see Sibyl play, even if it is only for\nan act.  I get hungry for her presence; and when I think of the\nwonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I am\nfilled with awe.”",
        "“You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can’t you?”",
        "He shook his head.  “To night she is Imogen,” he answered, “and\ntomorrow night she will be Juliet.”",
        "“When is she Sibyl Vane?”",
        "“Never.”",
        "“I congratulate you.”",
        "“How horrid you are!  She is all the great heroines of the world in\none.  She is more than an individual.  You laugh, but I tell you she\nhas genius.  I love her, and I must make her love me.  You, who know\nall the secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me!\nI want to make Romeo jealous.  I want the dead lovers of the [29]\nworld to hear our laughter, and grow sad.  I want a breath of our\npassion to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes\ninto pain.  My God, Harry, how I worship her!”  He was walking up and\ndown the room as he spoke.  Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks.\nHe was terribly excited.",
        "Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure.  How\ndifferent he was now from the shy, frightened boy he had met in Basil\nHallward’s studio!  His nature had developed like a flower, had borne\nblossoms of scarlet flame.  Out of its secret hiding-place had crept\nhis Soul, and Desire had come to meet it on the way.",
        "“And what do you propose to do?” said Lord Henry, at last.",
        "“I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act.  I\nhave not the slightest fear of the result.  You won’t be able to\nrefuse to recognize her genius.  Then we must get her out of the\nJew’s hands.  She is bound to him for three years–at least for two\nyears and eight months–from the present time.  I will have to pay\nhim something, of course.  When all that is settled, I will take a\nWest-End theatre and bring her out properly.  She will make the world\nas mad as she has made me.”",
        "“Impossible, my dear boy!”",
        "“Yes, she will.  She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in\nher, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it\nis personalities, not principles, that move the age.”",
        "“Well, what night shall we go?”",
        "“Let me see.  To-day is Tuesday.  Let us fix to-morrow.  She plays\nJuliet to-morrow.”",
        "“All right.  The Bristol at eight o’clock; and I will get Basil.”",
        "“Not eight, Harry, please.  Half-past six.  We must be there before\nthe curtain rises.  You must see her in the first act, where she\nmeets Romeo.”",
        "“Half-past six!  What an hour!  It will be like having a meat-tea.\nHowever, just as you wish.  Shall you see Basil between this and\nthen?  Or shall I write to him?”",
        "“Dear Basil!  I have not laid eyes on him for a week.  It is rather\nhorrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful\nframe, designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous of it\nfor being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit that I\ndelight in it.  Perhaps you had better write to him.  I don’t want to\nsee him alone.  He says things that annoy me.”",
        "Lord Henry smiled.  “He gives you good advice, I suppose.  People are\nvery fond of giving away what they need most themselves.”",
        "“You don’t mean to say that Basil has got any passion or any romance\nin him?”",
        "“I don’t know whether he has any passion, but he certainly has\nromance,” said Lord Henry, with an amused look in his eyes.  “Has he\nnever let you know that?”",
        "“Never.  I must ask him about it.  I am rather surprised to hear it.\nHe is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit of a\nPhilistine.  Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered that.”",
        "“Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into\n[30] his work.  The consequence is that he has nothing left for life\nbut his prejudices, his principles, and his common sense.  The only\nartists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad\nartists.  Good artists give everything to their art, and consequently\nare perfectly uninteresting in themselves.  A great poet, a really\ngreat poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures.  But inferior\npoets are absolutely fascinating.  The worse their rhymes are, the\nmore picturesque they look.  The mere fact of having published a book\nof second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible.  He lives the\npoetry that he cannot write.  The others write the poetry that they\ndare not realize.”",
        "“I wonder is that really so, Harry?” said Dorian Gray, putting some\nperfume on his handkerchief out of a large gold-topped bottle that\nstood on the table.  “It must be, if you say so.  And now I must be\noff.  Imogen is waiting for me.  Don’t forget about to-morrow.  Good-\nby.”",
        "As he left the room, Lord Henry’s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began\nto think.  Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as\nDorian Gray, and yet the lad’s mad adoration of some one else caused\nhim not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy.  He was pleased\nby it.  It made him a more interesting study.  He had been always\nenthralled by the methods of science, but the ordinary subject-matter\nof science had seemed to him trivial and of no import.  And so he had\nbegun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others.\nHuman life,–that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating.\nThere was nothing else of any value, compared to it.  It was true\nthat as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and\npleasure, one could not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, or keep\nthe sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the\nimagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams.\nThere were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to\nsicken of them.  There were maladies so strange that one had to pass\nthrough them if one sought to understand their nature.  And, yet,\nwhat a great reward one received!  How wonderful the whole world\nbecame to one!  To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the\nemotional colored life of the intellect,–to observe where they met,\nand where they separated, at what point they became one, and at what\npoint they were at discord,–there was a delight in that!  What\nmatter what the cost was?  One could never pay too high a price for\nany sensation.",
        "He was conscious–and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into\nhis brown agate eyes–that it was through certain words of his,\nmusical words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul\nhad turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her.  To a\nlarge extent, the lad was his own creation.  He had made him\npremature.  That was something.  Ordinary people waited till life\ndisclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the\nmysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away.\nSometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of\nliterature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the\nintellect.  But now and then a complex personality took the place and\nassumed the office of art, was indeed, in its [31] way, a real work\nof art, Life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has,\nor sculpture, or painting.",
        "Yes, the lad was premature.  He was gathering his harvest while it\nwas yet spring.  The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he\nwas becoming self-conscious.  It was delightful to watch him.  With\nhis beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder\nat.  It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end.  He\nwas like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose\njoys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense\nof beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.",
        "Soul and body, body and soul–how mysterious they were!  There was\nanimalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.\nThe senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade.  Who could\nsay where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began?\nHow shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists!\nAnd yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various\nschools!  Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin?  Or was\nthe body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought?  The\nseparation of spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of\nspirit with matter was a mystery also.",
        "He began to wonder whether we should ever make psychology so absolute\na science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us.\nAs it was, we always misunderstood ourselves, and rarely understood\nothers.  Experience was of no ethical value.  It was merely the name\nwe gave to our mistakes.  Men had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode\nof warning, had claimed for it a certain moral efficacy in the\nformation of character, had praised it as something that taught us\nwhat to follow and showed us what to avoid.  But there was no motive\npower in experience.  It was as little of an active cause as\nconscience itself.  All that it really demonstrated was that our\nfuture would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done\nonce, and with loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.",
        "It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method\nby which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions;\nand certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed\nto promise rich and fruitful results.  His sudden mad love for Sibyl\nVane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest.  There was\nno doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the\ndesire for new experiences; yet it was not a simple but rather a very\ncomplex passion.  What there was in it of the purely sensuous\ninstinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the\nimagination, changed into something that seemed to the boy himself to\nbe remote from sense, and was for that very reason all the more\ndangerous.  It was the passions about whose origin we deceived\nourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us.  Our weakest motives\nwere those of whose nature we were conscious.  It often happened that\nwhen we thought we were experimenting on others we were really\nexperimenting on ourselves.",
        "While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the\ndoor, and his valet entered, and reminded him it was time to dress\n[32] for dinner.  He got up and looked out into the street.  The\nsunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses\nopposite.  The panes glowed like plates of heated metal.  The sky\nabove was like a faded rose.  He thought of Dorian Gray’s young\nfiery-colored life, and wondered how it was all going to end.",
        "When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o’clock, he saw a\ntelegram lying on the hall-table.  He opened it and found it was from\nDorian.  It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to\nSibyl Vane.",
