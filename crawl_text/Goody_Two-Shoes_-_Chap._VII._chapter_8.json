        "              Containing an Account of all the Spirits,\n                 or Ghosts, she saw in the Church.",
        "The People were ashamed to ask Little Madge any Questions\nbefore Mr. Long, but as soon as he was gone, they all got round\nher to satisfy their Curiousity, and desired she would give them a\nparticular Account of all that she had heard and seen.",
        "                              Her TALE.",
        "I went to the Church, said she, as most of you did last Night, to see\nthe Burying, and being very weary, I sate me down in Mr.\nJones’s Pew, and fell fast asleep. At Eleven of the Clock I\nawoke; which I believe was in some measure occasioned by the Clock’s\nstriking, for I heard it. I started up, and could not at first tell\nwhere I was; but after some Time I recollected the Funeral, and soon\nfound that I was shut in the Church. It was dismal dark, and I could\nsee nothing; but while I was standing in the Pew, something jumped up\nupon me behind, and laid, as I thought, its Hands over my\nShoulders.–I own, I was a little afraid at first; however, I\nconsidered that I had always been constant at Prayers and at Church,\nand that I had done nobody any Harm, but had endeavoured to do what\nGood I could; and then, thought I, what have I to fear? yet I kneeled\ndown to say my Prayers. As soon as I was on my Knees something very\ncold, as cold as Marble, ay, as cold as Ice, touched my Neck, which\nmade me start; however, I continued my Prayers, and having begged\nProtection from Almighty GOD, I found my Spirits come, and I was\nsensible that I had nothing to fear; for GOD Almighty protects not\nonly all those who are good, but also all those who endeavour to be\ngood.–Nothing can withstand the Power, and exceed the Goodness of GOD\nAlmighty. Armed with the Confidence of his Protection, I walked down\nthe Church Isle, when I heard something, pit pat, pit pat, pit pat,\ncome after me, and something touched my Hand, which seemed as cold as\na Marble Monument. I could not think what this was, yet I knew it\ncould not hurt me, and therefore I made myself easy, but being very\ncold, and the Church being paved with Stone, which was very damp, I\nfelt my Way as well as I could to the Pulpit, in doing which something\nbrushed by me, and almost threw me down. However I was not frightened,\nfor I knew, that GOD Almighty would suffer nothing to hurt me.",
        "At last, I found out the Pulpit, and having shut too the Door, I laid\nme down on the Mat and Cushion to sleep; when something thrust and\npulled the Door, as I thought for Admittance, which prevented my going\nto sleep. At last it cries, Bow, wow, wow; and I concluded it\nmust be Mr. Saunderson’s Dog, which had followed me from their\nHouse to Church, so I opened the Door, and called Snip, Snip,\nand the Dog jumped up upon me immediately. After this Snip and\nI lay down together, and had a most comfortable Nap; for when I awoke\nagain it was almost light. I then walked up and down all the Isles of\nthe Church to keep myself warm; and though I went into the Vault, and\ntrod on Lady Ducklington’s Coffin, I saw no Ghost, and I\nbelieve it was owing to the Reason Mr. Long has given you,\nnamely, that there is no such Thing to be seen. As to my Part, I would\nas soon lie all Night in the Church as in any other Place; and I am\nsure that any little Boy or Girl, who is good, and loves GOD Almighty,\nand keeps his Commandments, may as safely lie in the Church, or the\nChurch-yard, as any where else, if they take Care not to get Cold; for\nI am sure there are no Ghosts, either to hurt, or to frighten them;\nthough any one possessed of Fear might have taken Neighbour\nSaunderson’s Dog with his cold Nose for a Ghost; and if they\nhad not been undeceived, as I was, would never have thought otherwise.\nAll the Company acknowledged the Justness of the Observation, and\nthanked Little Two-Shoes for her Advice.",
        "After this, my dear Children, I hope you will not believe any foolish\nStories that ignorant, weak, or designing People may tell you about\nGhosts; for the Tales of Ghosts, Witches, and Fairies, are the\nFrolicks of a distempered Brain. No wise Man ever saw either of them.\nLittle Margery you see was not afraid; no, she had good Sense,\nand a good Conscience, which is a Cure for all these imaginary\nEvils.",
