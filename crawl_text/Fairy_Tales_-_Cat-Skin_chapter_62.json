        "There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and\nwas so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole\nface of the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she\nfelt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said,\n’Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a\nwife who is as beautiful as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.’\nThen when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her\neyes and died. But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long\ntime never thought of taking another wife. At last, however, his wise\nmen said, ’this will not do; the king must marry again, that we may\nhave a queen.’ So messengers were sent far and wide, to seek for a\nbride as beautiful as the late queen. But there was no princess in the\nworld so beautiful; and if there had been, still there was not one to\nbe found who had golden hair. So the messengers came home, and had had\nall their trouble for nothing.",
        "Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,\nand had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king\nlooked at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he\nsaid to his courtiers, ’May I not marry my daughter? She is the very\nimage of my dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride\nupon the whole earth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the\ncourtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, ’Heaven forbid that\na father should marry his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can\ncome.’ And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would\nsoon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, ’Before I marry anyone\nI must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another\nmust be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling\nas the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different\nkinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must\ngive a part of his skin.’ And thus she though he would think of the\nmatter no more. But the king made the most skilful workmen in his\nkingdom weave the three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another\nsilvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his\nhunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to\ntake the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a\nthousand furs was made.",
        "When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the\nnight when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden\nring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three\ndresses–of the sun, the moon, and the stars–up in a nutshell, and\nwrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and\nbesmeared her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon\nHeaven for help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole\nnight, till at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired,\nshe sat herself down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and\nthere she slept on till it was midday.",
        "Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs\ncame to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round,\nand bark. ’Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ’and see what\nsort of game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and\nwhen they came back again said, ’In the hollow tree there lies a most\nwonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of\na thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ’See,’ said\nthe king, ’if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So\nthe huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly\nfrightened, and said, ’I am a poor child that has neither father nor\nmother left; have pity on me and take me with you.’ Then they said,\n’Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the\nashes, and do things of that sort.’ So they put her into the coach,\nand took her home to the king’s palace. Then they showed her a little\ncorner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped in, and\nsaid, ’Cat-skin, you may lie and sleep there.’ And she was sent into\nthe kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow the fire, pluck\nthe poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty\nwork.",
        "Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ’Ah! pretty\nprincess!’ thought she, ’what will now become of thee?’ But it\nhappened one day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so\nshe said to the cook, ’May I go up a little while and see what is\ngoing on? I will take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook\nsaid, ’Yes, you may go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to\nrake out the ashes.’ Then she took her little lamp, and went into her\ncabin, and took off the fur skin, and washed the soot from off her\nface and hands, so that her beauty shone forth like the sun from\nbehind the clouds. She next opened her nutshell, and brought out of it\nthe dress that shone like the sun, and so went to the feast. Everyone\nmade way for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she could be\nno less than a king’s daughter. But the king came up to her, and held\nout his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, ’I\nnever saw any one half so beautiful.’",
        "When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked\nround for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood\nat the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth\nwas, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,\nblackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was Cat-\nskin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to\nrake the ashes, the cook said, ’Let that alone till the morning, and\nheat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but\ntake care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance\nof never eating again.’",
        "As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king’s soup, and\ntoasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when\nit was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden\nring, and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance\nwas over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased\nhim so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before.\nAt the bottom he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out\nhow it had got there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was\nfrightened when he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ’You must\nhave let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good\nbeating.’ Then he went before the king, and he asked him who had\ncooked the soup. ’I did,’ answered the cook. But the king said, ’That\nis not true; it was better done than you could do it.’ Then he\nanswered, ’To tell the truth I did not cook it, but Cat-skin did.’\n’Then let Cat-skin come up,’ said the king: and when she came he said\nto her, ’Who are you?’ ’I am a poor child,’ said she, ’that has lost\nboth father and mother.’ ’How came you in my palace?’ asked he. ’I am\ngood for nothing,’ said she, ’but to be scullion-girl, and to have\nboots and shoes thrown at my head.’ ’But how did you get the ring that\nwas in the soup?’ asked the king. Then she would not own that she knew\nanything about the ring; so the king sent her away again about her\nbusiness.",
        "After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to\nlet her go up and see it as before. ’Yes,’ said he, ’but come again in\nhalf an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.’ Then\nshe ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her\ndress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she\nwent in, looking like a king’s daughter, the king went up to her, and\nrejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with\nher. After the dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly\nthat the king did not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her\nlittle cabin, and made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the\nkitchen to cook the soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got\nthe golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought\nto the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as well as before; so he\nsent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had\ncooked it. Cat-skin was brought again before the king, but she still\ntold him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her\nhead.",
        "But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third\ntime, it happened just the same as before. ’You must be a witch, Cat-\nskin,’ said the cook; ’for you always put something into your soup, so\nthat it pleases the king better than mine.’ However, he let her go up\nas before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars,\nand went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again,\nand thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So\nwhilst he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger\nwithout her seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a\nlong time. When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the\nhand, but she slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd\nthat he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her\nlittle cabin under the stairs. But this time she kept away too long,\nand stayed beyond the half-hour; so she had not time to take off her\nfine dress, and threw her fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not\nblacken herself all over with soot, but left one of her fingers white.",
        "Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’s soup; and as soon\nas the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When\nthe king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once\nmore, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on\nit whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold\nof it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur\ncloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled\nunderneath it.",
        "Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and\nbeautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she\nwashed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the\nmost beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,\n’You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each\nother.’ And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as\never was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.",
