        "Conspicuous among the wise men of Longobucco in olden days was the\nphysician Bruno, who “flourished” about the end of the thirteenth\ncentury. He called himself Longoburgensis Calaber, and his great\ntreatise on anatomical dissection, embodying much Greek and Arabic lore,\nwas printed many years after his death. Another was Francesco Maria\nLabonia; he wrote, in 1664, “De vera loci urbis Timesinae situatione,\netc.,” to prove, presumably, that his birthplace occupied the site\nwhence the Homeric ore of Temese was derived. There are modern writers\nwho support this view.",
        "The local silver mines were exploited in antiquity; first by Sybaris,\nthen by Croton. They are now abandoned, but a good deal has been written\nabout them. In the year 1200 a thousand miners were employed, and the\nAnjous extracted a great deal of precious metal thence; the goldsmiths\nof Longobucco were celebrated throughout Italy during the Middle Ages.\nThe industrious H. W. Schulz has unearthed a Royal rescript of 1274\ncharging a certain goldsmith Johannes of Longobucco with researches into\nthe metal and salt resources of the whole kingdom of Naples.",
        "Writing from Longobucco in 1808 during a brigand-hunt, Duret de Tavel says:",
        "“The high wooded mountains which surround this horrible place spread\nover it a sombre and savage tint which saddens the imagination. This\nborough contains a hideous population of three thousand souls, composed\nof nail-makers, of blacksmiths and charcoal-burners. The former\ngovernment employed them in working the silver mines situated in the\nneighbourhood which are now abandoned.”",
        "He tells a good deal about the brigandage that was then rife here, and\nthe atrocities which the repression of this pest entailed. Soon after\nhis arrival, for instance, four hundred soldiers were sent to a village\nwhere the chiefs of the brigand “insurrection” were supposed to be\nsheltered. The soldiers, he says, “poured into the streets like a\ntorrent in flood, and there began a horrible massacre, rendered\ninevitable by the obstinacy of the insurgents, who fired from all the\nhouses. This unhappy village was sacked and burnt, suffering all the\nhorrors inseparable from a capture by assault.” Two hundred dead were\nfound in the streets. But the brigand chiefs, the sole pretext of this\nbloodshed, managed to escape. Perhaps they were not within fifty miles\nof the place.",
        "Be that as it may, they were captured later on by their own compatriots,\nafter the French had waited a month at Longobucco. Their heads were\nbrought in, still bleeding, and “l’identite ayant ete suffisamment\nconstatee, la mort des principaux acteurs a termine cette sanglante\ntragedie, et nous sommes sortis de ces catacombes apennines pour revoir\nle plus brillant soleil.”",
        "Wonderful tales are still told of the brigands in these forests. They\nwill show you notches on the trees, cut by such and such a brigand for\nsome particular purpose of communication with his friends; buried\ntreasure has been found, and even nowadays shepherds sometimes discover\nrude shelters of bark and tree trunks built by them in the thickest part\nof the woods. There are legends, too, of caverns wherein they hived\ntheir booty–caverns with cleverly concealed entrances–caverns which\n(many of them, at least) I regard as a pure invention modelled after the\nauthentic brigand caves of Salerno and Abruzzi, where the limestone rock\nis of the kind to produce them. Bourbonism fostered the brood, and there\nwas a fierce recrudescence in the troubled sixties. They lived in bands,\n squadrigli, burning and plundering with impunity. Whoever refused to\ncomply with their demands for food or money was sure to repent of it.\nAll this is over, for the time being; the brigands are extirpated, to\nthe intense relief of the country people, who were entirely at their\nmercy, and whose boast it is that their district is now as safe as the\nstreets of Naples. Qualified praise, this. . . . [Footnote: See next\nchapter.]",
        "It is an easy march of eight hours or less, through pleasing scenery and\nby a good track, from Longobucco to San Giovanni in Fiore, the capital\nof the Sila. The path leaves Longobucco at the rear of the town and,\nclimbing upward, enters a valley which it follows to its head. The\npeasants have cultivated patches of ground along the stream; the slopes\nare covered, first with chestnuts and then with hoary firs–a rare\ngrowth, in these parts–from whose branches hangs the golden bough of\nthe mistletoe. And now the stream is ended and a dark ridge blocks the\nway; it is overgrown with beeches, under whose shade you ascend in steep\ncurves. At the summit the vegetation changes once more, and you find\nyourself among magnificent stretches of pines that continue as far as\nthe governmental domain of Galoppano, a forestal station, two hours’\nwalk from Longobucco.",
        "This pine is a particular variety (Pinus lancio, var. Calabra),\nknown as the “Pino della Sila\"–it is found over this whole country,\nand grows to a height of forty metres with a silvery-grey trunk,\nexhaling a delicious aromatic fragrance. In youth, especially where the\nsoil is deep, it shoots up prim and demure as a Nuremberg toy; but in\nold age grows monstrous. High-perched upon some lonely granite boulder,\nwith roots writhing over the bare stone like the arms of an octopus, it\nsits firm and unmoved, deriding the tempest and flinging fantastic limbs\ninto the air–emblem of tenacity in desolation. From these trees, which\nin former times must have covered the Sila region, was made that\nBruttian pitch mentioned by Strabo and other ancient writers; from them\nthe Athenians, the Syracusans, Tarentines and finally the Romans built\ntheir fleets. Their timber was used in the construction of Caserta palace.",
        "A house stands here, inhabited by government officials the whole year\nround–one may well puzzle how they pass the long winter, when snow lies\nfrom October to May. So early did I arrive at this establishment that\nthe more civilized of its inhabitants were still asleep; by waiting, I\nmight have learnt something of the management of the estate, but gross\nmaterial preoccupations–the prospect of a passable luncheon at San\nGiovanni after the “Hotel Vittoria” fare–tempted me to press forwards.\nA boorish and unreliable-looking individual volunteered three pieces of\ninformation–that the house was built thirty years ago, that a large\nnursery for plants lies about ten kilometres distant, and that this\nparticular domain covers “two or four thousand hectares.” A young\nplantation of larches and silver birches–aliens to this region–seemed\nto be doing well.",
        "Not far from here, along my track, lies Santa Barbara, two or three\nhuts, with corn still green–like Verace (above Acri) on the watershed\nbetween the Ionian and upper Grati. Then follows a steep climb up the\nslopes of Mount Pettinascura, whose summit lies 1708 metres above\nsea-level. This is the typical landscape of the Sila Grande. There is\nnot a human habitation in sight; forests all around, with views down\nmany-folded vales into the sea and towards the distant and fairy-like\nApennines, a serrated edge, whose limestone precipices gleam like\ncrystals of amethyst between the blue sky and the dusky woodlands of the\nforeground.",
        "Here I reposed awhile, watching the crossbills, wondrously tame, at work\namong the branches overhead, and the emerald lizard peering out of the\nbracken at my side. This lucertone, as they call it, is a local beast,\nvery abundant in some spots (at Venosa and Patirion, for example); it is\nelsewhere conspicuous by its absence. The natives are rather afraid of\nit, and still more so of the harmless gecko, the “salamide,” which is\nreputed highly poisonous.",
        "Then up again, through dells and over uplands, past bubbling streams,\nsometimes across sunlit meadows, but oftener in the leafy shelter of\nmaples and pines–a long but delightful track, winding always high above\nthe valleys of the Neto and Lese. At last, towards midday, I struck the\ndriving road that connects San Giovanni with Savelli, crossed a bridge\nover the foaming Neto, and climbed into the populous and dirty streets\nof the town–the “Siberia of Calabria,” as it may well be, for seven\nmonths of the year.",
        "At this season, thanks to its elevation of 1050 metres, the temperature\nis all that could be desired, and the hotel, such as it is, compares\nfavourably indeed with the den at Longobucco. Instantly I felt at home\namong these good people, who recognized me, and welcomed me with the\ncordiality of old friends.",
        "“Well,” they asked, “and have you found it at last?”",
        "They remembered my looking for the double flute, the tibiae pares,\nsome years ago.",
        "It will not take you long to discover that the chief objects of interest\nin San Giovanni are the women. Many Calabrian villages still possess\ntheir distinctive costumes–Marcellinara and Cimi-gliano are celebrated\nin this respect–but it would be difficult to find anywhere an equal\nnumber of handsome women on such a restricted space. In olden days it\nwas dangerous to approach these attractive and mirthful creatures; they\nwere jealously guarded by brothers and husbands. But the brothers and\nhusbands, thank God, are now in America, and you may be as friendly with\nthem as ever you please, provided you confine your serious attentions to\nnot more than two or three. Secrecy in such matters is out of the\nquestion, as with the Arabs; there is too much gossip, and too little\ncoyness about what is natural; your friendships are openly recognized,\nand tacitly approved. The priests do not interfere; their hands are full.",
        "To see these women at their best one must choose a Sunday or a\nfeast-day; one must go, morever, to the favourite fountain of Santa\nLucia, which lies on the hill-side and irrigates some patches of corn\nand vegetables. Their natural charms are enhanced by elaborate and\ntasteful golden ornaments, and by a pretty mode of dressing the hair,\ntwo curls of which are worn hanging down before their ears with an\nirresistibly seductive air. Their features are regular; eyes black or\ndeep gentian blue; complexion pale; movements and attitudes impressed\nwith a stamp of rare distinction. Even the great-grandmothers have a\ncertain austere dignity–sinewy, indestructible old witches, with tawny\nhide and eyes that glow like lamps.",
        "And yet San Giovanni is as dirty as can well be; it has the accumulated\nfilth of an Eastern town, while lacking all its glowing tints or\nharmonious outlines. We are disposed to associate squalor with certain\nartistic effects, but it may be said of this and many other Calabrian\nplaces that they have solved the problem how to be ineffably squalid\nwithout becoming in the least picturesque. Much of this sordid look is\ndue to the smoke which issues out of all the windows and blackens the\nhouse walls, inside and out–the Calabrians persisting in a prehistoric\nfashion of cooking on the floor. The buildings themselves look crude and\ngaunt from their lack of plaster and their eyeless windows; black pigs\nwallowing at every doorstep contribute to this slovenly ensemble. The\nCity Fathers have turned their backs upon civilization; I dare say the\nmagnitude of the task before them has paralysed their initiative.",
        "Nothing is done in the way of public hygiene, and one sees women washing\nlinen in water which is nothing more or less than an open drain. There\nis no street-lighting whatever; a proposal on the part of a North\nItalian firm to draw electric power from the Neto was scornfully\nrejected; one single tawdry lamp, which was bought some years ago “as a\nsample” in a moment of municipal recklessness, was lighted three times\nin as many years, and on the very day when it was least necessary–to\nwit, on midsummer eve, which happens to be the festival of their patron\nsaint (St. John). “It now hangs\"–so I wrote some years ago–\"at a\ndangerous angle, and I doubt whether it will survive till its services\nare requisitioned next June.” Prophetic utterance! It was blown down\nthat same winter, and has not yet been replaced. This in a town of\n20,000 (?) inhabitants–and in Italy, where the evening life of the\npopulace plays such an important role. No wonder North Italians, judging\nby such external indications, regard all Calabrians as savages.",
        "Some trees have been planted in the piazza since my last stay here; a\nnewspaper has also been started–it is called “Co-operation: Organ of\nthe Interests of San Giovanni in Fiore,” and its first and possibly\nunique number contains a striking article on the public health, as\nrevealed in the report of two doctors who had been despatched by the\nprovincial sanitary authorities to take note of local conditions of\nhygiene. “The illustrious scientists” (thus it runs) “were horrified at\nthe filth, mud and garbage which encumbered, and still encumbers, our\nstreets, sending forth in the warm weather a pestilential odour. . . .\nThey were likewise amazed at the vigorously expressed protest of our\nmayor, who said: ’My people cannot live’ without their pigs wallowing\nin the streets. San Giovanni in Fiore is exempt from earthquakes and\nepidemics because it is under the protection of Saint John the Baptist,\nand because its provincial councillor is a saintly man.’” Such\njournalistic plain speaking, such lack of sweet reasonableness, cannot\nexpect to survive in a world governed by compromise, and if the gift of\nprophecy has not deserted me, I should say that “Co-operation” has by\nthis time ended its useful mission upon earth.",
        "This place is unhealthy; its water-supply is not what it should be, and\nsuch commodities as eggs and milk are rather dear, because “the invalids\neat everything” of that kind. Who are the invalids? Typhoid patients\nand, above all, malarious subjects who descend to the plains as\nagricultural labourers and return infected to the hills, where they\nbecome partially cured, only to repeat the folly next year. It is the\nsame at Longobucco and other Sila towns. Altogether, San Giovanni has\ngrave drawbacks. The streets are too steep for comfort, and despite its\nheight, the prospect towards the Ionian is intercepted by a ridge; in\npoint of situation it cannot compare with Savelli or the neighbouring\nCasino, which have impressive views both inland, and southward down\nundulating slopes that descend in a stately procession of four thousand\nfeet to the sea, where sparkles the gleaming horn of Cotrone. And the\nsurroundings of the place are nowise representative of the Sila in a\ngood sense. The land has been so ruthlessly deforested that it has\nbecome a desert of naked granite rocks; even now, in midsummer, the\ncitizens are already collecting fuel for their long winter from enormous\ndistances. As one crawls and skips among these unsavoury tenements, one\ncannot help regretting that Saint John the Baptist, or the piety of a\nprovincial councillor, should have hindered the earthquakes from doing\ntheir obvious duty.",
        "Were I sultan of San Giovanni, I would certainly begin by a general\nbombardment. Little in the town is worth preserving from a cataclysm\nsave the women, and perhaps the old convent on the summit of the hill\nwhere the French lodged during their brigand-wars, and that other one,\nfamous in the ecclesiastical annals of Calabria–the monastery of\nFloriacense, founded at the end of the twelfth century, round which the\ntown gradually grew up. Its ponderous portal is much injured, having\nbeen burnt, I was told, by the brigands in 1860. But the notary, who\nkindly looked up the archives for me, has come to the conclusion that\nthe French are responsible for the damage. It contains, or contained, a\nfabulous collection of pious lumber–teeth and thigh-bones and other\nrelics, the catalogue of which is one of my favourite sections of Father\nFiore’s work. I would make an exception, also, in favour of the doorway\nof the church, a finely proportioned structure of the Renaissance in\nblack stone, which looks ill at ease among its ignoble environment. A\npriest, to whom I applied for information as to its history, told me\nwith the usual Calabrian frankness that he never bothered his head about\nsuch things.",
        "San Giovanni was practically unknown to the outside world up to a few\nyears ago. I question whether Lenormant or any of them came here.\nPacicchelli did, however, in the seventeenth century, though he has left\nus no description of the place. He crossed the whole Sila from the\nIonian to the other sea. I like this amiable and loquacious creature,\nrestlessly gadding about Europe, gloriously complacent, hopelessly,\nabsorbed in trivialities, and credulous beyond belief. In fact (as the\nreader may have observed), I like all these old travellers, not so much\nfor what they actually say, as for their implicit outlook upon life.\nThis Pacicchelli was a fellow of our Royal Society, and his accounts of\nEngland are worth reading; here, in Calabria (being a non-southerner)\nhis “Familiar Letters” and “Memoirs of Travel” act as a wholesome\ncorrective. Which of the local historians would have dared to speak of\nCosenza as “citta aperta, scomposta, e disordinata di fabbriche”?",
        "That these inhabitants of the Sila are Bruttians may be inferred from\nthe superior position occupied by their women-folk, who are quite\ndifferently treated to those of the lowlands. There–all along the\ncoasts of South Italy–the cow-woman is still found, unkempt and\nuncivilized; there, the male is the exclusive bearer of culture. Such\nthings are not seen among the Bruttians of the Sila, any more than among\nthe grave Latins or Samnites. These non-Hellenic races are, generally\nspeaking, honest, dignified and incurious; they are bigoted, not to say\nfanatical; and their women are not exclusively beasts of burden, being\nbetter dressed, better looking, and often as intelligent as the men.\nThey are the fruits of a female selection.",
        "But wherever the mocking Ionic spirit has penetrated–and the Ionian\nwomen occupied even a lower position than those of the Dorians and\nAeolians–it has resulted in a glorification of masculinity. Hand in\nhand with this depreciation of the female sex go other characteristics\nwhich point to Hellenic influences: lack of commercial morality, of\nveracity, of seriousness in religious matters; a persistent,\nlight-hearted inquisitiveness; a levity (or sprightliness, if you prefer\nit) of mind. The people are fetichistic, amulet-loving, rather than\ndevout. We may certainly suspect Greek or Saracen strains wherever women\nare held in low estimation; wherever, as the god Apollo himself said,\n“the mother is but the nurse.” In the uplands of Calabria the mother is\na good deal more than the nurse.",
        "For the rest, it stands to reason that in proportion as the agricultural\nstage supplants that of pasturage, the superior strength and utility of\nboys over girls should become more apparent, and this in South Italy is\nuniversally proclaimed by the fact that everything large and fine is\nlaughingly described as “maschio” (male), and by some odd superstitions\nin disparagement of the female sex, such as these: that in giving\npresents to women, uneven numbers should be selected, lest even ones “do\nthem more good than they deserve\"; that to touch the hump of a female\nhunchback brings no luck whatever; that if a woman be the first to drink\nout of a new earthenware pitcher, the vessel may as well be thrown away\nat once–it is tainted for ever. [Footnote: In Japan, says Hearn, the\nfirst bucketful of water to be drawn out of a cleaned well must be drawn\nby a man; for if a womsn first draw water, the well will always\nhereafter remain muddy. Some of these prejudices seem to be based on\nprimordial misreadmgs of physiology. There is also a strong feeling in\nfavour of dark hair. No mother would entrust her infant to a fair\nwet-nurse; the milk even of white cows is considered “lymphatic” and not\nstrengthening; perhaps the eggs of white hens are equally devoid of the\nfortifying principle. There is something to be said for this since, in\nproportion as we go south, the risk of irritation, photophobia, and\nother com-plaints incidental to the xanthous complexion becomes\ngreater.] Yet the birth of a daughter is no Chinese calamity; even girls\nare “Christians” and welcomed as such, the populace having never sunk\nto the level of our theologians, who were wont to discuss an faemina\nsint monstra.",
        "All over the Sila there is a large preponderance of women over men,\nnearly the whole male section of the community, save the quite young and\nthe decrepit, being in America. This emigration brings much money into\nthe country and many new ideas; but the inhabitants have yet to learn\nthe proper use of their wealth, and to acquire a modern standard of\ncomfort. Together with the Sardinians, these Calabrians are the hardiest\nof native races, and this is what makes them prefer the strenuous but\nlucrative life in North American mines to the easier career in\nArgentina, which Neapolitans favour. There they learn English. They\nremember their families and the village that gave them birth, but their\npatriotism towards Casa Savoia is of the slenderest. How could it be\notherwise? I have spoken to numbers of them, and this is what they say:",
        "“This country has done nothing for us; why should we fight its battles?\nNot long ago we were almost devouring each other in our hunger; what did\nthey do to help us? If we have emerged from misery, it is due to our own\ninitiative and the work of our own hands; if we have decent clothes and\ndecent houses, it is because they drove us from our old homes with their\ninfamous misgovern-ment to seek work abroad.”",
        "Perfectly true! They have redeemed themselves, though the new regime has\nhardly had a fair trial. And the drawbacks of emigration (such as a\nslight increase of tuberculosis and alcoholism) are nothing compared\nwith the unprecedented material prosperity and enlightenment. There has\nalso been–in these parts, at all events–a marked diminution of crime.\nNo wonder, seeing that three-quarters of the most energetic and\nturbulent elements are at present in America, where they recruit the\nBlack Hand. That the Bruttian is not yet ripe for town life, that his\nvirtues are pastoral rather than civic, might have been expected; but\nthe Arab domination of much of his territory, one suspects, may have\ninfused fiercer strains into his character and helped to deserve for him\nthat epithet of sanguinario by which he is proud to be known.",
