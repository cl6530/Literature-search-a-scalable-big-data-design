        "When I crossed the Russian front in October, 1919, the first\nthing I noticed in peasants’ cottages, in the villages, in the\nlittle town where I took the railway to Moscow, in every\nrailway station along the line, was the elaborate pictorial\npropaganda concerned with the war.  There were posters\nshowing Denizen standing straddle over Russia’s coal, while\nthe factory chimneys were smokeless and the engines idle in\nthe yards, with the simplest wording to show why it was\nnecessary to beat Denizen in order to get coal; there were\nposters illustrating the treatment of the peasants by the\nWhites; posters against desertion, posters illustrating the\nRussian struggle against the rest of the world, showing a\nworkman, a peasant, a sailor and a soldier fighting in\nself-defence against an enormous Capitalistic Hydra.  There\nwere also-and this I took as a sign of what might\nbe-posters encouraging the sowing of corn, and posters\nexplaining in simple pictures improved methods of\nagriculture.  Our own recruiting propaganda during the war,",
        "good as that was, was never developed to such a point of\nexcellence, and knowing the general slowness with which\nthe Russian centre reacts on its periphery, I was amazed not\nonly at the actual posters, but at their efficient distribution\nthus far from Moscow.",
        "I have had an opportunity of seeing two of the propaganda\ntrains, the object of which is to reduce the size of Russia\npolitically by bringing Moscow to the front and to the out of\nthe way districts, and so to lessen the difficulty of obtaining\nthat general unity of purpose which it is the object of\npropaganda to produce.  The fact that there is some hope\nthat in the near future the whole of this apparatus may be\nturned over to the propaganda of industry makes it perhaps\nworth while to describe these trains in detail.",
        "Russia, for purposes of this internal propaganda, is divided\ninto five sections, and each section has its own train,\nprepared for the particular political needs of the section it\nserves, bearing its own name, carrying its regular crew-a\npropaganda unit, as corporate as the crew of a ship. The\nfive trains at present in existence are the “Lenin,” the\n“Sverdlov,” the “October Revolution,” the “Red East,\"\nwhich is now in Turkestan, and the “Red Cossack,” which,\nready to start for Rostov and the Don, was standing, in the\nsidings at the Kursk station, together with the “Lenin,\"\nreturned for refitting and painting.",
        "Burov, the organizer of these trains, a ruddy, enthusiastic\nlittle man in patched leather coat and breeches, took a party\nof foreigners-a Swede, a Norwegian, two Czechs, a German\nand myself to visit his trains, together with Radek, in the\nhope that Radek would induce Lenin to visit them, in which\ncase Lenin would be kinematographed for the delight of the\nvillagers, and possibly the Central Committee would, if\nLenin were interested, lend them more lively support.",
        "We walked along the “Lenin” first, at Burov’s special\nrequest.  Burov, it seems, has only recently escaped from\nwhat he considered a bitter affliction due to the Department\nof Proletarian Culture, who, in the beginning, for the",
        "decoration of his trains, had delivered him bound hand\nand foot to a number of Futurists.  For that reason\nhe wanted us to see the “Lenin” first, in order that we might\ncompare it with the result of his emancipation, the “Red\nCossack,” painted when the artists “had been brought under\nproper control.”  The “Lenin” had been painted a year and a\nhalf ago, when, as fading hoarding in the streets of Moscow\nstill testify, revolutionary art was dominated by the Futurist\nmovement.  Every carriage is decorated with most striking\nbut not very comprehensible pictures in the brightest colors,\nand the proletariat was called upon to enjoy what the\npre-revolutionary artistic public had for the most part failed to\nunderstand.  Its pictures are “art for art’s sake,” and cannot\nhave done more than astonish, and perhaps terrify, the\npeasants and the workmen of the country towns who had the\nluck to see them.  The “Red Cossack” is quite different.\nAs Burov put it with deep satisfaction, “At first we were in the\nartists’ hands, and now the artists are in our hands,” a sentence\nsuggesting the most horrible possibilities of official\nart under socialism, although, of course, bad art flourishes\npretty well even under other systems.",
        "I inquired exactly how Burov and his\nfriends kept the artists in the right way, and received the\nfullest explanation.  The political section of the organization\nworks out the main idea and aim for each picture, which\ncovers the whole side of a wagon.  This idea is then\nsubmitted to a “collective” of artists, who are jointly\nresponsible for its realization in paint.  The artists compete\nwith each other for a prize which is awarded for the best\ndesign, the judges being the artists themselves.  It is the art\nof the poster, art with a purpose of the most definite kind.\nThe result is sometimes amusing, interesting, startling, but,\nwhatever else it does, hammers home a plain idea.",
        "Thus the picture on the side of one wagon is divided into\ntwo sections.  On the left is a representation of the peasants\nand workmen of the Soviet Republic.  Under it are the\nwords, “Let us not find ourselves again...” and then, in\ngigantic lettering under the right-hand section of the picture,\n“... in the HEAVEN OF THE WHITES.”  This heaven is",
        "shown by an epauletted officer hitting a soldier in the face,\nas was done in the Tsar’s army and in at least one army of\nthe counter revolutionaries, and workmen tied to\nstakes, as was done by the Whites in certain towns in the\nsouth.  Then another wagon illustrating the methods of Tsardom,\nwith a State vodka shop selling its wares to wretched folk,\nwho, when drunk on the State vodka, are flogged by the\nState police.  Then there is a wagon showing the different\nCossacks-of the Don, Terek, Kuban, Ural-riding in pairs.\nThe Cossack infantry is represented on the other side of\nthis wagon.  On another wagon is a very jolly picture of\nStenka Razin in his boat with little old-fashioned brass\ncannon, rowing up the river.  Underneath is written the\nwords: “I attack only the rich, with the poor I divide\neverything.”  On one side are the poor folk running from\ntheir huts to join him, on the other the rich folk firing at him\nfrom their castle.  One wagon is treated purely decoratively,\nwith a broad effective characteristically South Russian\ndesign, framing a huge inscription to the effect that the\nCossacks need not fear that the Soviet Republic will\ninterfere with their religion, since under its regime every\nman is to be free to believe exactly what he likes.\nThen there is an entertaining wagon, showing Kolchak\nsitting inside a fence in Siberia  with a Red soldier\non guard, Judenitch sitting in a little circle with a sign-post\nto show it is  Esthonia, and Denikin running at full speed\nto the asylum indicated by another sign-post on which is\nthe crescent of the Turkish Empire. Another lively picture\nshows the young Cossack girls learning to read, with a\nmost realistic old Cossack woman telling them they had\nbetter not.  But there is no point in describing every\nwagon.  There are sixteen wagons in the “Red Cossack,\"\nand every one is painted all over on both sides.",
        "The internal arrangements of the train are a sufficient proof\nthat Russians are capable of organization if they set their\nminds to it.  We went through it, wagon by wagon.  One\nwagon contains a wireless telegraphy station capable of\nreceiving news from such distant stations as those of\nCarnarvon or Lyons.  Another is fitted up as a newspaper\noffice, with a mechanical press capable of printing an edition\nof fifteen thousand daily, so that the district served by the\ntrain, however out of the way, gets its news simultaneously\nwith Moscow, many days sometimes before the belated Izvestia",
        "or Pravda finds its way to them.  And with its latest\nnews it gets its latest propaganda, and in order to get the\none it cannot help getting the other.  Next door to that there\nis a kinematograph wagon, with benches to seat about one\nhundred and fifty persons.  But indoor performances are\nonly given to children, who must come during the daytime,\nor in summer when the evenings are too light to permit an\nopen air performance.  In the ordinary way, at night, a great\nscreen is fixed up in the open.  There is a special hole cut in\nthe side of the wagon, and through this the kinematograph\nthrows its picture on the great screen outside, so that several\nthousands can see it at once.  The enthusiastic Burov insisted\non working through a couple of films for us, showing the\nCommunists boy scouts in their country camps, children’s\nmeetings in Petrograd, and the big demonstrations of last\nyear in honor of the Third International.  He was extremely\ndisappointed that Radek, being in a hurry, refused to wait\nfor a performance of “The Father and his Son,” a drama\nwhich, he assured us with tears in his eyes, was so thrilling\nthat we should not regret being late for our appointments if\nwe stayed to witness it.  Another wagon is fitted up as an\nelectric power-station, lighting the train, working the\nkinematograph and the printing machine,etc.  Then there is a\nclean little kitchen and dining-room, where, before being\nkinematographed-a horrible experience when one is first\nquite seriously begged (of course by Burov) to assume an\nexpression of intelligent interest-we had soup, a plate of\nmeat and cabbage, and tea.  Then there is a wagon\nbookshop, where, while customers buy books, a\ngramophone sings the revolutionary songs of Demian\nBledny, or speaks with the eloquence ofTrotsky or the logic\nof Lenin.  Other wagons are the living-rooms of the\npersonnel, divided up according to their duties-political,\nmilitary, instructional, and so forth.  For the train has not\nmerely an agitational purpose.  It carries with it a staff to\ngive advice to local authorities, to explain what has not been\nunderstood, and so in every way to bring the ideas of\nthe Centre quickly to the backwoods of the Republic.  It works\nalso in the opposite direction, helping to make the voice of\nthe backwoods heard at Moscow.  This is illustrated by a\npainted pillar-box on one of the wagons, with a slot for\nletters, labelled, “For Complaits of Every Kind.”  Anybody\nanywhere who has grievance, thinks he is being unfairly\ntreated, or has a suggestion to make, can speak with\nthe Centre in this way.  When the train is on a voyage",
        "telegrams announce its arrival beforehand, so that the local\nSoviets can make full use of its advantages, arranging meetings,\nkinematograph shows, lectures.  It arrives, this amazing\npicture train, and proceeds to publish and distribute its\nnewspapers, sell its books (the bookshop, they tell me, is\nliterally stormed at every stopping place), send books and\nposters for forty versts on either side of the line with the\nmotor-cars which it carries with it, and enliven the\npopulation with its kinematograph.",
        "I doubt if a more effective instrument of propaganda has\never been devised.  And in considering the question whether\nor no the Russians will be able after organizing their military\ndefence to tackle with similar comparative success the much\nmore difficult problem of industrial rebirth, the existence of\nsuch instruments, the use of such propaganda is a factor not\nto be neglected.  In the spring of this year, when the civil\nwar seemed to be ending, when there was a general belief\nthat the Poles would accept the peace that Russia offered\n(they ignored this offer, advanced, took Kiev, were\ndriven back to Warsaw, advanced again, and finally agreed\nto terms which they could have had in March without\nbloodshed any kind), two of these propaganda trains were\nalready being repainted with a new purpose.  It was hoped\nthat in the near future all five trains would be explaining not\nthe need to fight but the need to work.  Undoubtedly, at the\nfirst possible moment, the whole machinery of agitation, of\nposters, of broadsheets and of trains, will be turned over to\nthe task of explaining the Government’s plans for\nreconstruction, and the need for extraordinary concentration,\nnow on transport, now on something else, that these plans\ninvolve.",
