        "Dinner with the Witch",
        "Biddy meanwhile had waddled around the room slapping the boards with\nher broad bare feet as she prepared their dinner. She was evidently\ntrying to put on style, for she turned out her toes excessively.\nShe spoke several times about “the toime when she resoided with yer\nmamma,” then at length, “Whayer’s the tablecloth, Granny?”",
        "“Now, wud ye listen to thot, an’ she knowin’ that divil a clath hev we\nin the wurruld, an’ glad enough to hev vittles on the table, let\nalone a clath,” said Granny, oblivious of the wreck she was making of\nBiddy’s pride.",
        "“Will ye hay tay or coffee, Yahn?” said Biddy.",
        "“Tea,” was Yan’s choice.",
        "“Faix, an’ Oi’m glad ye said tay, fur Oi ain’ seen a pick o’ coffee\nsense Christmas, an’ the tay Oi kin git in the woods, but thayer is\nsomethin’ Oi kin set afore ye that don’t grow in the woods,” and the\nold woman hobbled to a corner shelf, lifted down an old cigar box and\nfrom among matches, tobacco, feathers, tacks, pins, thread and dust\nshe picked six lumps of cube sugar, formerly white.",
        "“Thayer, shure, an’ Oi wuz kapin’ this fur whin his riv’rence comes;\nwanst a year he’s here, God bless him! but that’s fower wakes ahid,\nan’ dear knows fwhat may happen afore thin. Here, an’ a hearty\nwelcome,” said she, dropping three of the lumps in Yan’s tea. “We’ll\nkape the rest fur yer second cup. Hev some crame?” and she pushed over\na sticky-handled shaving-mug full of excellent cream. “Biddy, give\nYahn some bread.”",
        "The loaf, evidently the only one, was cut up and two or three slices\nforced into Yan’s plate.",
        "“Mebbe the butther is a little hoigh,” exclaimed the hostess, noting\nthat Yan was sparing of it. “Howld on.” She went again to the corner\nshelf and got down an old glass jar with scalloped edge and a flat tin\ncover. It evidently contained jam. She lifted the cover and exclaimed:",
        "“Well, Oi niver!” Then going to the door she fished out with her\nfingers a dead mouse and threw it out, remarking placidly, “Oi’ve\nwondered whayer the little divil wuz. Oi ain’t sane him this two\nwakes, an’ me a-thinkin’ it wuz Tom ate him. May Oi be furgiven the\nonjustice av it. Consarn them flies! That cover niver did fit.” And\nagain her finger was employed, this time to scrape off an incrustation\nof unhappy flies that had died, like Clarence, in their favourite\nbeverage.",
        "“Thayer, Yan, now ate hearty, all av it, an’ welcome. It does me good\nto see ye ate–thayer’s lots more whayer that come from,” though it\nwas obvious that she had put her all upon the table.",
        "Poor Yan was in trouble. He felt instinctively that the good old soul\nwas wrecking her week’s resources in this lavish hospitality, but he\nalso felt that she would be deeply hurt if he did not appear to enjoy\neverything. The one possibly clean thing was the bread. He devoted\nhimself to that; it was of poorest quality; one or two hairs looping\nin his teeth had been discouraging, but when he bit at a piece of\nlinen rag with a button on it he was fairly upset. He managed to hide\nthe rag, but could not conceal his sudden loss of appetite.",
        "“Hev some more av this an’ this,” and in spite of himself his\nplate was piled up with things for him to eat, including a lot of\nbeautifully boiled potatoes, but unfortunately the hostess carried\nthem from the pot on the stove in a corner of her ancient and somber\napron, and served him with her skinny paw.",
        "Yan’s appetite was wholly gone now, to the grief of his kind\nentertainer, “Shure an’ she’d fix him up something to stringthen him,\"\nand Yan had hard work to beg off.",
        "“Would ye like an aig,” ventured Biddy.",
        "“Why, yes! oh, yes, please,” exclaimed Yan, with almost too much\nenthusiasm. He thought, “Well, hens are pure-minded creatures, anyway.\nAn egg’s sure to be clean.”",
        "Biddy waddled away to the ’barrun’ and soon reappeared with three\neggs.",
        "“B’iled or fried?”",
        "“Boiled,” said Yan, aiming to keep to the safe side.",
        "Biddy looked around for a pot.",
        "“Shure, that’s b’ilin’ now,” said Granny, pointing to the great\nmass of her undergarments seething in the boiler, and accordingly the\neggs were dropped in there.",
        "Yan fervently prayed that they might not break. As it was, two did\ncrack open, but he got the other one, and that was virtually his\ndinner.",
        "A Purple Blackbird came hopping in the door now.",
        "“Will, now, thayer’s Jack. Whayer hev ye been? I thought ye wuz gone\nfur good. Shure Oi saved him from a murtherin’ gunner,” she explained.\n“(Bad scran to the baste! I belave he was an Or’ngeman.) But he’s all\nright now an’ comes an’ goes like he owned the place. Now, Jack, you\ngit out av that wather pail,” as the beautiful bird leaped into the\nhalf-filled drinking bucket and began to take a bath.",
        "“Now luk at that,” she shouted, “ye little rascal, come out o’ that\noven,” for now the Blackbird had taken advantage of the open door to\nscramble into the dark warm oven.",
        "“Thayer he goes to warrum his futs. Oh, ye little rascal! Next thing\nye know some one’ll slam the dooer, not knowin’ a thing, and fire up,\nan’ it’s roastin’ aloive ye’ll be. Shure an’ it’s tempted Oi am to\nwring yer purty neck to save yer loife,” and she drove him out with\nthe harshest of words and the gentlest of hands.",
        "Then Yan, with his arms full of labelled plants, set out for home.",
        "“Good-boi, choild, come back agin and say me soon. Bring some more\nhairbs. Good-boi, an’ bless ye. Oi hope it’s no sin to say so, fur Oi\nknow yer a Prattison an’ ye are all on yez goin’ to hell, but yer a\nfoine bhoy. Oi’m tumble sorry yer a Prattison.”",
        "When Yan got back to the Raftens’ he found the dinner table set for\none, though it was now three in the afternoon.",
        "“Come and get your dinner,” said Mrs. Raften in her quiet motherly\nway. “I’ll put on the steak. It will be ready in five minutes.”",
        "“But I’ve had my dinner with Granny de Neuville.”",
        "“Yes, I know!”",
        "“Did she stir yer tea with one front claw an’ put jam on yer bread\nwith the other?” asked Raften, rather coarsely.",
        "“Did she b’ile her pet Blackbird fur yer soup?” said Sam.",
        "Yan turned very red. Evidently all had a good idea of what he had\nexperienced, but it jarred on him to hear their mockery of the good\nold soul.",
        "He replied warmly, “She was just as kind and nice as she could be.”",
        "“You had better have a steak now,” said Mrs. Raften, in solicitous\ndoubt.",
        "How tempting was the thought of that juicy brown steak! How his empty\nstomach did crave it! But the continued mockery had stirred him. He\nwould stand up for the warm-hearted old woman who had ungrudgingly\ngiven him the best she had–had given her all–to make a hearty\nwelcome for a stranger. They should never know how gladly he would\nhave eaten now, and in loyalty to his recent hostess he added the\nfirst lie of his life:",
        "“No, thank you very much, but really I am not in the least hungry. I\nhad a fine dinner at Granny de Neuville’s.”",
        "Then, defying the inner pangs of emptiness, he went about his evening\nchores.",
