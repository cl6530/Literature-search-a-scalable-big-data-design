        "In Europe we are accustomed to cultivate the rose merely as an ornament of\nthe garden. This is not the case with my Indian acquaintance; they\ncultivate the rose as a useful article, essential to their health, and\nconducive to their comfort.",
        "The only rose I have ever seen them solicitous about is the old-fashioned\n’hundred-leaf’ or cabbage-rose’.[1] Where-ever a Mussulmaun population\ncongregate these are found planted in enclosed fields. In the month of\nSeptember, the rose trees are cut down to within eight inches of the\nsurface of the earth, and the cuttings carefully planted in a sheltered\nsituation for striking, to keep up a succession of young trees. By the\nfirst or second week in December the earliest roses of the season are in\nbloom on the new wood, which has made its way from the old stock in this\nshort period. Great care is taken in gathering the roses to preserve every\nbud for a succession. A gardener in India is distressed when the Beeby\nSahibs[2] (English ladies) pluck roses, aware that buds and all are\nsacrificed at once. I shall here give a brief account of the several\npurposes to which the rose is applied.",
        "Rose-water is distilled in most Mussulmaun families as a medicine and an\nindispensable luxury. For medicine, it is administered in all cases of\nindigestion and pains of the stomach or bowels,–the older the rose-water\nthe more effectual the remedy. I have been accustomed to see very old\nrose-water administered in doses of a wine-glass full, repeated frequently,\nin cases of cholera morbus and generally with good effect, when the\npatient has applied the remedy in time and due care has been observed in\npreventing the afflicted person from taking any other liquid until the\nworst symptoms have subsided. This method of treatment may not accord with\nthe views of professional men generally; however, I only assert what I\nhave repeatedly seen, that it has been administered to many members of my\nhusband’s family with the best possible effect. On one occasion, after\neating a hearty dinner, Meer Hadjee Shaah was attacked with cholera;\nrose-water was administered, with a small portion of the stone called zahur\nmorah. In his agony, he complained of great thirst, when rose-water was\nagain handed to him, and continued at intervals of half-an-hour during the\nday and part of the night. In the morning, the pain and symptoms had\ngreatly subsided; he was, notwithstanding, restrained from taking any\nliquid or food for more than forty-eight hours, except occasionally a\nlittle rose-water; and when his Native doctors permitted him to receive\nnourishment, he was kept on very limited portions of arrow-root for\nseveral days together. At the end of about eight days (the fever having\nbeen entirely removed) chicken-broth was allowed, and at first without\nbread; solids, indeed, were only permitted when all fears of a relapse had\nceased, and even then but partially for some time, fearing the\nconsequences to the tender state of the bowels. Such persons as are\nabstemious and regard the quality of their daily food are most likely to\nrecover from the attack of this awful scourge. Very young children are\nrarely amongst the sufferers by cholera; the adults of all classes are\nmost subject to it in India; indeed, I do not find the aged or the\nyouthful, either male or female, preponderate in the number attacked; but\nthose who live luxuriously suffer most. Amongst the Natives, it is\ndifficult to prevail on them to forego their usual meals, particularly\namongst the lower orders: if they feel rather inconvenienced by heartburns\nor other indications of a disordered stomach, they cannot resist eating\nagain and again at the appointed hours, after which strong symptoms of\ncholera usually commence. I never heard of one case occurring after a good\nnight’s rest, but invariably after eating, either in the morning or the\nevening.",
        "My remarks have drawn me from my subject, by explaining the supposed\nmedicinal benefits of rose-water, which as a luxury is highly valued in\nIndia. It is frequently used by the Natives in preparing their sweet\ndishes, is added to their sherbet, sprinkled over favoured guests, used to\ncleanse the mouth-piece of the hookha, and to cool the face and hands in\nvery hot weather. Although they abstain from the use of rose-water,\nexternally and internally, when suffering from a cold,–they fancy\nsmelling a rose will produce a cold, and I have often observed in India,\nthat smelling a fresh rose induces sneezing,[3]–yet, at all other times,\nthis article is in general use in respectable Mussulmaun families. Dried\nrose-leaves and cassia added to infusions of senna, is a family medicine\nin general request.",
        "The fresh rose-leaves are converted by a very simple process into a\nconserve, which is also used as a medicine; it is likewise an essential\narticle, with other ingredients, in the preparation of tobacco for their\nluxurious hookha.",
        "A syrup is extracted from the fresh rose, suited admirably to the climate\nof India as an aperient medicine, pleasant to the taste and mild in its\neffects. A table-spoon full is considered a sufficient dose for adults.",
        "The seed of the rose is a powerful astringent, and often brought into use\nin cases of extreme weakness of the bowels. The green leaves are\nfrequently applied pounded as a cold poultice to inflamed places with much\nthe same effect as is produced in England from golard-water.[4]",
        "The oil or otta of roses is collected from the rose-water when first\ndistilled. Persons intending to procure the otta, have the rose-water\npoured into dishes while warm from the still: this remains undisturbed\ntwenty-four hours, when the oily substance is discovered on the surface as\ncream on milk; this is carefully taken off, bottled, the mouth closed with\nwax, and then exposed to the burning rays of the sun for several days. The\nrose-water is kept in thin white glass bottles, and placed in baskets for\na fortnight, either on the roofs of houses or on a grass-plot; or wherever\nthe sun by day and the dew by night may be calculated on, which act on the\nrose-water and induce that fragrant smell so peculiar to that of India.",
        "I have elsewhere remarked that the Native medical practice is strictly\nherbal; minerals are strongly objected to as pernicious in after\nconsequences, although they may prove effectual in removing present\ninconvenience. Quicksilver[5] is sometimes resorted to by individuals, but\nwithout the sanction of their medical practitioners. They have no notion\nof the anatomy of the human body, beyond a few ideas suggested in the old\nGrecian school of medicine, in favour of which they are strongly\nprejudiced. They, however, are said to perform extraordinary cures by\nsimple treatment, many cases of severe fever occurred under my own\nobservation, which were removed, I really believe, by strict attention to\ndiet, or rather starving the enemy from its strong hold, than by any of\nthe medicines administered to the patients. If any one is attacked by\nfever, his medical adviser inquires the day and the hour it commenced, by\nwhich he is guided in prescribing for the patient. On the borehaun[6]\n(critical days) as the third, fifth, and seventh, after the fever\ncommences, nothing could induce the medical doctor to let blood or\nadminister active medicines; there only remains then for the patient to be\ndebarred any kind of food or nourishment, and that duly observed, the\nfever is often thrown off without a single dose of medicine. By three or\nfour days of most strict abstinence, and such simple nourishment as the\nthinnest gruel or barley water,–the latter made from the common field\nbarley, very sparingly allowed, the patient is rendered convalescent.",
        "The Natives of India profess to have found an antidote to, and cure for,\nhydrophobia in the reetah[7] berry, described as a saponaceous nut. I have\nnever seen a case of hydrophobia, but it is by no means uncommon, I\nunderstand. They always advise that the person bitten by a rabid animal,\nshould have the limb promptly tied up with a bandage above and below the\nbite; the wound, as speedily as possible, to be seared with a red-hot iron,\nand a few doses of the reetah berry with a portion of soap administered.\nThe berry is well known for its good property in cleansing and softening\nthe hair, for which purpose it is generally found in the bathing-rooms\nboth of the European and Native ladies.",
        "The Native remedy for snake bites, is called neellah tootee[8] (blue\nvitrol): if from eight to twelve grains be administered in ghee or butter\nimmediately after the bite is received, the happiest results will follow.\nA person in our family was bitten by a snake, but neglected to apply for\nthe remedy for more than half an hour after the accident, when his own\nexpressions were, that ’he suffered great uneasiness in his body, and his\nfaculties seemed darkened;’ half a masha, about eight grains of blue stone,\nwas now given in ghee. In a few hours he was apparently quite well again,\nand for several days he found no other inconvenience than a slight\nnumbness in the hand which had been bitten by the snake.",
        "This person had occasion soon after to leave home, and had exerted himself\nunusually by walking, when he found the same symptoms of uneasiness return;\nhe hurried to a house where he was known, and requested to be supplied\nwith a certain quantity of blue stone without delay. He had sense enough\nremaining to explain for what purpose he required it, when the person\napplied to objected to furnish him with the poisonous article. The remedy,\nhowever, was ultimately procured, taken, and in a few hours he was\nrecovered sufficiently to return home. He never found the symptoms return\nagain to my recollection.",
        "The chitcherah[9] (inverted thorn), is a shrub common to India, which\nbears small grains not unlike rice; these seeds are poisonous in their\nnatural state, but when properly prepared with a portion of\nurzeez[10]–(tin), it becomes a useful medicine; and in particular cases\nof scrofula, which have resisted all other remedies offered by the medical\npractitioners, the Natives tell me this has proved an effectual remedy;\nand my informant, a Native doctor, assures me that three doses, of three\ngrains each, is all he finds necessary to give his patient in scrofula\ncases.",
        "The chitcherah in its green state is resorted to as a remedy for the sting\nof scorpions: when applied to the wound, which is often much inflamed and\nvery painful, the cure is prompt. The scorpion runs from this shrub when\nheld to it, as if it were frightened: many people declare scorpions are\nnever met with in the grounds where the chitcherah grows.",
        "The neam-tree[11] is cultivated near the houses of Natives generally, in\nthe Upper Provinces, because, as they affirm, it is very conducive to\nhealth, to breathe the air through the neam-trees. This tree is not very\nquick of growth, but reaches a good size. When it has attained its full\nheight, the branches spread out as luxuriantly as the oak and supplies an\nagreeable shelter from the sun. The bark is rough; the leaves long, narrow,\ncurved, pointed, and with saw teeth edges; both the wood and leaves\npartake of the same disagreeable bitter flavour. The green leaves are used\nmedicinally as a remedy for biles; after being pounded they are mixed with\nwater and taken as a draught; they are also esteemed efficacious as\npoultices and fomentations for tumours, &c. The young twigs are preferred\nby all classes of the Natives for tooth-brushes.",
        "The hurrundh,[12] or castor-tree, is cultivated by farmers in their\ncorn-fields throughout Hindoostaun. This tree seldom exceeds in its growth\nthe height of an English shrub. The bark is smooth; the leaf, in shape,\nresembles the sycamore, but of a darker green. The pods containing the\nseed grow in clusters like grapes, but of a very different appearance, the\nsurface of each pod being rough, thorny, and of a dingy red cast when ripe.\nThe seed produces the oil, which is in common use as a powerful medicine,\nfor men and animals. In remote stations, where any difficulty exists in\nprocuring cocoa-nut oil, the castor oil is often rendered useful for\nburning in lamps; the light, however, produced by it is very inferior to\nthe oil of cocoa-nut. The green leaves are considered cooling to wounds or\ninflamed places, and therefore used with ointment after the\nblister-plaster is removed.",
        "As I have seen this tree growing in corn-fields, I may here remark that\nthe farmer’s motives for cultivating it originate in the idea that his\ncrops are benefited by a near vicinity to the hurrundh. It is also very\ncommon to observe a good row of the plant called ulsee[13](linseed),\nbordering a plantation of wheat or barley: they fancy this herb preserves\nthe blade healthy, and the corn from blight.",
        "The umultass[14] (cassia) is a large and handsome forest tree, producing\nthat most useful drug in long dark pods, several inches long, which hang\nfrom the branches in all directions, giving a most extraordinary\nappearance to the tree. The seed is small and mixed with the pulp, which\ndissolves in water, and is in general use with the Natives as a powerful\nand active medicine in bilious cases. I am not, however, aware that the\nseed possesses any medicinal property: it certainly is not appropriated to\nsuch cases in Hindoostaun.",
        "Myrtle-trees,[15] under many different names, and of several kinds, are\nmet with in India, of an immense size compared with those grown in Europe.\nThey are cultivated for their known properties, rather than as mere\nornaments to the garden. The leaves, boiled in water, are said to be of\nservice to the hair; the root and branches are considered medicinal.",
        "The pomegranate-tree[16] may be ranked amongst the choicest beauties of\nAsiatic horticulture; and when its benefits are understood, no one wonders\nthat a tree or two is to be seen in almost every garden and compound of\nthe Mussulmaun population in India.",
        "The finest fruit of this sort is brought, however, from Persia and Cabul,\nat a great expense; and from the general estimation in which it is held,\nthe merchants annually import the fruit in large quantities. There are two\nsorts, the sweet and the acid pomegranate, each possessing medicinal\nproperties peculiar to itself. Sherbet is made from the juice, which is\npressed out, and boiled up with sugar or honey to a syrup; thus prepared\nit keeps good for any length of time, and very few families omit making\ntheir yearly supply, as it constitutes a great luxury in health, and a\nreal benefit in particular disorders. The Natives make many varieties of\nsherbet from the juices of their fruits, as the pine-apple, falsah,[17]\nmango, or any other of the same succulent nature, each having properties\nto recommend it beyond the mere pleasantness of its flavour.",
        "An admirer of Nature must be struck with the singular beauty of the\npomegranate-tree, so commonly cultivated in India. The leaves are of a\nrich dark green, very glossy, and adorned at the same time with every\nvariety of bud, bloom, and fruit, in the several stages of vegetation,\nfrom the first bud to the ripe fruit in rich luxuriance, and this in\nsuccession nearly throughout the year. The bright scarlet colour of the\nbuds and blossoms seldom vary in their shades; but contrasted with the\nglossy dark green foliage, the effect excites wonder and admiration. There\nis a medicinal benefit to be derived from every part of this tree from its\nroot upwards, each part possessing a distinct property, which is employed\naccording to the Native knowledge and practice of medicine.",
        "Even the falling blossoms are carefully collected, and when made into a\nconserve, are administered successfully in cases of blood-spitting.",
        "The tamarind-tree may often be discovered sheltering the tomb of revered\nor sainted characters; but I am not aware of any particular veneration\nentertained towards this tree by the general population of India, beyond\nthe benefit derived from the medicinal properties of the fruit and the\nleaves.[18]",
        "The ripe fruit, soaked in salt and water, to extract the juices, is\nstrained, and administered as a useful aperient; and from its quality in\ncleansing the blood, many families prefer this fruit in their curries to\nother acids. From the tamarind-tree, preserves are made for the affluent,\nand chatnee for the poor, to season their coarse barley unleavened cakes,\nwhich form their daily meal, and with which they seem thoroughly contented.",
        "From what cause I know not, but it is generally understood that vegetation\ndoes not thrive in the vicinity of the tamarind-tree. Indeed, I have\nfrequently heard the Natives account for the tamarind being so often\nplanted apart from other trees, because they fancy vegetation is always\nretarded in their vicinity.",
        "The jahmun-tree[19] is also held in general estimation for the benefit of\nthe fruit, which, when ripe, is eaten with salt, and esteemed a great\nluxury, and in every respect preferable to olives. The fruit, in its raw\nstate, is a powerful astringent, and possesses many properties not\ngenerally known out of Native society, which may excuse my mentioning them\nhere. The fruit, which is about the size and colour of the damson-plum,\nwhen ripe is very juicy, and makes an excellent wine, not inferior in\nquality to port. The Natives, however, are not permitted by their law to\ndrink wine, and therefore this property in the fruit is of no benefit to\nthem; but they encourage the practice of extracting the juice of jahmun\nfor vinegar, which is believed to be the most powerful of all vegetable\nacids. The Native medical practitioners declare, that if by accident a\nhair has been introduced with food into the stomach, it can never digest\nof itself, and will produce both pain and nausea to the individual. On\nsuch occasions they administer jahmun vinegar, which has the property of\ndissolving any kind of hair, and the only thing they are aware of that\nwill. Sherbet is made of this vinegar, and is often taken in water either\nimmediately after dinner, or when digestion is tardy.",
        "The skin of the jahmun produces a permanent dye of a bright lilac colour,\nand with the addition of urzeez (tin), a rich violet. The effect on wool I\nhave never tried, but on silks and muslins the most beautiful shades have\nbeen produced by the simplest process possible, and so permanent, that the\ncolour resisted every attempt to remove it by washing, &c.[20]",
        "The mango-tree stands pre-eminently high in the estimation of the Natives,\nand this is not to be wondered at when the various benefits derived from\nit are brought under consideration. It is magnificent in its growth, and\nsplendid in its foliage, and where a plantation of mango-trees, called ’a\ntope’, is met with, that spot is preferred by travellers on which to pitch\ntheir tent. The season of blooming is about February and March; the\naromatic scent from the flowers is delightful, and the beautiful\nclustering of the blossoms is not very unlike the horse-chestnut in\nappearance and size, but branching horizontally. The young mangoes are\ngathered for preserves and pickles before the stone is formed; the\nfull-grown unripe fruit is peeled, split, and dried, for seasoning curries,\n&c. The ripe fruit spoken of in a former Letter requires no further\ncommendation, neither will it admit of comparison with any European fruits.\nThe kernels, when ripe, are often dried and ground into flour for bread in\nseasons of scarcity. The wood is useful as timber for doors, rafters, &c.,\nand the branches and leaves for fuel; in short, there is no part of the\nwhole tree but is made useful in some way to man.",
        "The sherrefah[21] (custard-apple) is produced on a very graceful tree, not,\nhowever, of any great size; the blossom nearly resembles that of the\norange in colour and shape; the fruit ripens in the hottest months, and is\nsimilar in flavour to well-made custards. The skin is of a dusky pea-green\nrough surface, in regular compartments; each division or part containing a\nglossy black seed covered with the custard. This seed is of some utility\namongst the lower order of Natives who have occasion to rid themselves of\nvermin at the expense of little labour; the seed is pounded fine and when\nmixed in the hair destroys the living plague almost instantly. The same\narticle is often used with a hair-pencil to remove a cataract of the eye\n(they have no idea of surgical operations on the eye). There is one thing\nworthy of remark in this tree and its fruit, that flies are never known to\nsettle on either; ants of every description feed on the fruit without\ninjury, so that it cannot be imagined there is anything poisonous to\ninsects, generally, in the quality of the fruit; yet, certain it is, the\nsherrefah is equally obnoxious to flies as the seed is destructive to\nvermin. The leaves and tender twigs are considered detrimental to health,\nif not actually poisonous to cattle.",
        "The guaver,[23] white and red, are produced in the Upper Provinces; but\nthe fruit is seldom so fine as in the Bengal district. The strong aromatic\nsmell and flavour of this fruit is not agreeable to all tastes; in size\nand shape it resembles the quince.",
        "The Damascus fig ripens well, and the fruit is superior to any I have met\nwith in other countries. The indigenous fig-tree of Hindoostaun is one of\nthe objects of Hindoo veneration. It has always been described to me by\nthose Natives, as the sacred burbut,[24]–why? they could not explain. The\nfruit is very inferior.",
        "The peach is cultivated in many varieties, and every new introduction\nrepays the careful gardener’s skill by a rich and beautiful produce. They\nhave a flat peach,[24] with a small round kernel (a native of China), the\nflavour of which is delicious, and the tree prolific.",
        "I may here remark, that all those trees we are accustomed in Europe to\ndesignate wall-fruit, are in India pruned for standards. The only fruit\nallowed to trail on frames is the vine, of which they have many choice\nvarieties; one in particular, of late introduction from Persia, has the\nremarkable peculiarity of being seedless, called ’Ba daanah’[25] (without\nseeds); the fruit is purple, round, and sweet as honey.",
        "Peach, nectarine, and apricot trees, are cut down early in February, much\nin the same way as willows are docked in England: the new wood grows\nrapidly, and the fruit is ready for the table in the month of June. A tree\nneglected to be pruned in this way annually, would the first year yield\nbut little, and that indifferent fruit, the tree become unhealthy, and, in\nmost cases, never again restored to its former vigour.",
        "Apple-trees are found chiefly in the gardens of Europeans; they are not\nperhaps as yet understood by Native gardeners, or it may be the climate is\nnot favourable to them; certain it is, that the apples produced in\nHindoostaun are not to be compared with those of other countries. Singular\nas it may seem, yet I have never met with more than one species of apple\nin my visits to the gardens of India. I have often fancied a fresh\nimportation of English apple-trees would be worth the trouble of the\ntransfer.[26]",
        "The apple-trees grow tall and slender, the blossoms break out on the top\nof each branch in a cluster; the fruit, when ripe, is about the size of\nsmall crabs, and shaped like golden-pippins, without any acidity, but the\nsweetness rather resembles turnips than the well-flavoured apple. In the\nbazaars are to be met with what is called apple-preserve, which, however,\nis often a deception,–turnips substituted for apples.",
        "Mulberries are indigenous, and of several varieties. The Native gardeners,\nhowever, take so little pains to assist or improve the operations of\nNature, that the mulberry here is seldom so fine as in other countries.\nThe common sort is produced on an immense tree with small leaves; the\nberry is long, and when ripe, of a yellow-green, very much resembling\ncaterpillars in colour and form.",
        "Plum-trees would thrive in Hindoostaun if introduced and cultivated,[27]\nsince the few, chiefly the bullace-plum, I have seen, produce tolerably\ngood fruit.",
        "Cherries, I have never observed; they are known, however, by the name of\n’glass’[28] to the travelling Natives, who describe them as common to\nCashmire, Cabul, and Persia.",
        "Gooseberries and currants are not known in India, but they have many good\nsubstitutes in the falsah, American sorrel, puppayah,[29] and a great\nvariety of Chinese fruits–all of which make excellent tarts, preserves,\nand jellies. Strawberries and raspberries repay their cultivation in the\nUpper Provinces: they thrive well with proper care and attention.",
        "The melon I have described elsewhere as an indigenous fruit greatly valued\nby the Natives, who cultivate the plant in the open fields without much\ntrouble, and with very little expense; the varieties are countless, and\nevery year adds to the number amongst the curious, who pride themselves on\nnovelty in this article of general estimation.",
        "The pine-apple requires very little pains to produce, and little demand on\nart in bringing it to perfection. The Bengal climate, however, suits it\nbetter than the dry soil of the Upper Provinces. I have frequently heard a\nsuperstitious objection urged by the Natives against this fruit being\nplanted in their regular gardens; they fancy prosperity is checked by its\nintroduction, or to use their own words,–’It is unfortunate to the\nproprietor of the garden.’",
        "There is a beautiful shrub, called by the Natives, mahdhaar, or\narg,[30]–literally, fire-plant,–met with in the Upper Provinces of India,\ninhabiting every wild spot where the soil is sandy, as generally as the\nthistle on neglected grounds in England.",
        "The mahdhaar-plant seldom exceeds four feet in height, the branches spread\nout widely, the leaves are thick, round, and broad; the blossom resembles\nour dark auricula. When the seed is ripe, the pod presents a real treat to\nthe lover of Nature. The mahdhaar pod may be designated a vegetable bag of\npure white silk, about the size of large walnuts. The skin or bag being\nremoved, flat seeds are discovered in layers over each other, resembling\nscales of fish; to each seed is affixed very fine white silk, about two\ninches long; this silk is defended from the air by the seed; the texture\ngreatly resembles the silky hair of the Cashmire goat. I once had the\nmahdhaar silk collected, spun, and wove, merely as an experiment, which\nanswered my full expectation: the article thus produced might readily be\nmistaken for the shawl stuff of Cashmire.[31]",
        "The stalks of mahdhaar, when broken, pour out a milky juice at all seasons\nof the year, which falling on the skin produces blisters. The Natives\nbring this juice into use both for medicine and alchymy in a variety of\nways.",
        "The mahdhaar, as a remedy for asthma, is in great repute with the Natives;\nit is prepared in the following way:–The plants are collected, root,\nstalks, and leaves, and well dried by exposure to the sun; they are then\nburnt on iron plates, and the ashes thrown into a pan of water, where they\nremain for some days, until the water has imbibed the saline particles; it\nis then boiled in an iron vessel, until the moisture is entirely absorbed,\nand the salt only left at the bottom. The salt is administered in\nhalf-grain doses at the first, and increasing the quantity when the\npatient has become accustomed to its influence: it would be dangerous to\nadd to the quantity suddenly.[32]",
        "Another efficient remedy, both for asthma and obstinate continuance of a\ncough, is found in the salt extracted from tobacco-leaves, by a similar\nprocess, which is administered with the like precaution, and in the same\nquantities.",
        "The sirrakee and sainturh[33] are two specimens of one genus of\njungle-grass, the roots of which are called secundah,[34] or khus-khus,[35]\nand are collected on account of their aromatic smell, to form thatch\ntatties, or screens for the doors and windows; which being kept constantly\nwatered, the strong wind rushing through the wet khus-khus is rendered\nagreeably cool, and produces a real luxury at the season of the hot winds,\nwhen every puff resembles a furnace-heat to those exposed to it by\nout-of-door occupation.",
        "This grass presents so many proofs of the beneficent care of Divine\nProvidence to the creatures of His hand, that the heart must be\nungratefully cold which neglects praise and thanksgiving to the Creator,\nwhose power and mercy bestows so great a benefit. The same might be justly\nurged against our insensibility, if the meanest herb or weed could speak\nto our hearts, each possessing, as it surely does, in its nature a\nbeneficial property peculiar to itself. But here the blessing is brought\nhome to every considerate mind, since a substitute for this article does\nnot appear to exist in India.",
        "I have seen the sainturh stalks, on which the bloom gracefully moves as\nfeathers, sixteen feet high. The sirrakee has a more delicate blossom,\nfiner stalk, and seldom, I believe, exceeds ten feet; the stalk resembles\na reed, full of pith, without a single joint from the shoot upwards; the\ncolour is that of clean wheat straw, but even more glossy. The blossom is\nof a silky nature possessing every variety of shade, from pure white to\nthe rainbow’s tints, as viewed in the distance at sunrise; and when\nplucked the separated blossoms have many varieties of hue from brown and\nyellow, to purple.",
        "The head or blossom is too light to weigh down the firm but flexible stalk;\nbut as the wind presses against each patch of grass, it is moved in a mass,\nand returns to its erect position with a dignity and grace not to be\ndescribed.",
        "I have watched for the approaching season of the blooming sirrakee with an\nanxiety almost childish; my attention never tired with observing the\nprogressive advances from the first show of blossom, to the period of its\narriving at full perfection; at which time, the rude sickle of the\nindustrious labourer levels the majestic grass to the earth for domestic\npurposes. The benefits it then produces would take me very long to\ndescribe.",
        "The sirrakee and sainturh are stripped from the outward sheltering blades,\nand wove together at the ends; in this way they are used for bordering\ntatties, or thatched roofs; sometimes they are formed into screens for\ndoors, others line their mud-huts with them. They are found useful in\nconstructing accommodations after the manner of bulk-heads on boats for\nthe river voyagers, and make a good covering for loaded waggons. For most\nof these purposes the article is well suited, as it resists moisture and\nswells as the wet falls on it, so that the heaviest rain may descend on a\nframe of sirrakee without one drop penetrating, if it be properly placed\nin a slanting position.",
        "I cannot afford space to enumerate here the variety of purposes which this\nproduction of Nature is both adapted for and appropriated to; every part\nof the grass being carefully stored by the thrifty husbandman, even to the\ntops of the reed, which, when the blossom is rubbed off, is rendered\nserviceable, and proves an excellent substitute for that useful invention,\na birch-broom. The coarse parent grass, which shelters the sirrakee, is\nthe only article yet found to answer the purposes for thatching the\nbungalows of the rich, the huts of the poor, the sheds for cattle, and\nroofs for boats. The religious devotee sets up a chupha-hut,[36] without\nexpense,–(all the house he requires,)–on any waste spot of land most\nconvenient to himself, away from the busy haunts of the tumultuous world,\nsince bamboo and grass are the common property of all who choose to take\nthe trouble of gathering it from the wilderness. And here neither rent or\ntaxes are levied on the inhabitant, who thus appropriates to himself a\nhome from the bounteous provision prepared by Divine goodness for the\nchildren of Nature.",
        "This grass is spontaneous in its growth, neither receiving or requiring\naid from human cultivation. It is found in every waste throughout\nHindoostaun, and is the prominent feature of the jungle, into which the\nwild animals usually resort for shelter from the heat of the day, or make\ntheir covert when pursued by man, their natural enemy.",
        "The beneficence of Heaven has also exacted but little labour from the\nhusbandman of India in procuring his daily provision. Indeed the actual\nwants of the lower order of Natives are few, compared with those of the\nsame class in England; exertion has not, therefore, been called forth by\nnecessity in a climate which induces habits of indulgence, ease, and quiet;\nwhere, however it may have surprised me at first, that I found not one\nsingle Native disposed to delight in the neat ordering of a flower-garden,\nI have since ascertained it is from their unwillingness to labour without\na stronger motive than the mere gratification of taste.[37] Hence the\nuncultivated ground surrounding the cottages in India, which must\nnaturally strike the mind of strangers with mingled feelings of pity and\nregret, when comparing the cottages of the English peasantry with those of\nthe same classes of people in Hindoostaun.",
        "The bamboo presents to the admirer of Nature no common specimen of her\nbeautiful productions; and to the contemplating mind a wide field for\nwonder, praise, and gratitude. The graceful movements of a whole forest of\nthese slender trees surpass all description; they must be witnessed in\ntheir uncultivated ground, as I have seen them, to be thoroughly\nunderstood or appreciated, for I do not recollect wood scenery in any\nother place that could convey the idea of a forest of bamboo.",
        "The bamboos are seen in clusters, striking from the parent root by suckers,\nperhaps from fifty to a hundred in a patch, of all sizes; the tallest in\nmany instances exceed sixty feet, with slender branches, and leaves in\npairs, which are long, narrow, and pointed. The body of each bamboo is\nhollow and jointed, in a similar way to wheat stalks, with bands or knots,\nby which wonderful contrivance both are rendered strong and flexible,\nsuited to the several designs of creative Wisdom. The bamboo imperceptibly\ntapers from the earth upwards. It is the variety of sizes in each cluster,\nhowever, which gives grace and beauty to the whole as they move with every\nbreath of air, or are swayed by the strong wind.",
        "Where space allows the experiment, the tallest bamboo may be brought down\nto a level with the earth, without snapping asunder. In the strong tempest\nthe supple bamboo may be seen to bow submissively,–as the self-subdued\nand pliant mind in affliction,–and again rear its head uninjured by the\nstorm, as the righteous man ’preserved by faith’ revives after each trial,\nor temptation.",
        "The wood of the bamboo is hard, yet light, and possesses a fine grain,\nthough fibrous. The outward surface is smooth and highly polished by\nNature, and the knot very difficult to penetrate by any other means than a\nsaw. The twigs or branches are covered with sharp thorns, in all\nprobability a natural provision to defend the young trees from herbaceous\nanimals. I have heard of the bamboo blossoming when arrived at full age;\nthis I have, however, never seen, and cannot therefore presume to\ndescribe.[38]",
        "In the hollow divisions of the bamboo is found, in small quantities, a\npure white tasteless substance, called tawurshear,[39] which as a medicine\nis in great request with the Native doctors, who administer it as a\nsovereign remedy for lowness of spirits, and every disease of the heart,\nsuch as palpitations, &c. The tawurshear when used medicinally is pounded\nfine, and mixed up with gold and silver leaf, preserved quinces and apples,\nand the syrup of pomegranates, which is simmered over a slow fire until it\nbecomes of the consistence of jam. It is taken before meals by the patient.",
        "The bamboo is rendered serviceable to man in a countless variety of ways,\nboth for use and ornament. The chuphas (thatched-roofs) of huts, cottages,\nor bungalows, are all constructed on frames of bamboo, to which each layer\nof grass is firmly fixed by laths formed of the same wood.",
        "The only doors in poor people’s habitations are contrived from the same\nmaterials as the roof: viz., grass on bamboo frames, just sufficient to\nsecure privacy and defend the inmates from cold air, or the nightly\nincursions of wolves and jackals. For the warm weather, screens are\ninvented of split bamboos, either fine or coarse, as circumstances permit,\nto answer the purpose of doors, both for the rich and poor, whenever the\nhouse is so situated that these intruders may be anticipated at night.",
        "The bamboo is made useful also in the kitchen as bellows by the aid of the\ncook’s breath; in the stable, to administer medicine to horses; and to the\npoor traveller, as a deposit for his oil, either for cooking or his lamp.\nTo the boatman as sculls, masts, yards, and poles; besides affording him a\ncovering to his boat, which could not be constructed with any other wood\nequally answering the same varied purpose of durability and lightness.",
        "The carriers (generally of the bearer caste), by the help of a split\nbamboo over the shoulder, convey heavy loads suspended by cords at each\nend, from one part of India to the other, many hundred miles distant. No\nother wood could answer this purpose so well; the bamboo being remarkably\nlight and of a very pliant nature lessens the fatigue to the bearer,\nwhilst almost any wood sufficiently strong to bear the packages would fret\nthe man’s shoulder and add burden to burden. The bearers do not like to\ncarry more than twelve seer (twenty-four pounds) slung by ropes at each\nend of their bamboo for any great distance; but, I fear, they are not\nalways allowed the privilege of thinking for themselves in these matters.",
        "When a hackery[40] (sort of waggon) is about to be loaded with of corn or\ngoods, a railing is formed by means of bamboos to admit the luggage; thus\nrendering the waggon itself much lighter than if built of solid wood, an\nobject of some moment, when considering the smallness of the cattle used\nfor draught, oxen of a small breed being in general use for waggons, carts,\nploughs, &c. I have never seen horses harnessed to any vehicle in India,\nexcept to such gentlemen’s carriages as are built on the English principle.",
        "The Native carriages of ladies and travellers are indebted to the bamboo\nfor all the wood used in the construction of the body, which is merely a\nframe covered with cloth, shaped in several different ways,–some square,\nothers double cones, &c.",
        "Baskets of every shape and size, coarse or fine, are made of the split\nbamboo; covers for dinner trays, on which the food is sent from the\nkitchen to the hall; cheese-presses, punkahs, and screens, ingeniously\ncontrived in great varieties; netting-needles and pins, latches and bolts\nfor doors; skewers and spits; umbrella sticks, and walking canes; toys in\ncountless ways, and frames for needle-work.",
        "A long line of etceteras might here be added as to the number of good\npurposes to which the bamboo is adapted and appropriated in Native economy;\nI must not omit that even the writing-paper on which I first practised the\nPersian character was manufactured from the bamboo, which is esteemed more\ndurable, but not so smooth as their paper made from cotton. The young\nshoots of bamboo are both pickled and preserved by the Natives, and\nesteemed a great luxury when produced at meals with savoury pillaus, &c.",
        "I am told, a whole forest of bamboo has sometimes been consumed by fire,\nignited by their own friction in a heavy storm, and the blaze fanned by\nthe opposing wind; the devouring element, under such circumstances, could\nbe stayed only when there ceased to be a tree to feed the flame.",

It\n    is an undoubted fact that the flowering of the bamboo is decided by\n    causes which bring about famine, for the providential supply of food\n    from this source has saved the lives of thousands of persons during\n    several of the great famines of India.’ Hence the provision of the\n    edible seeds by the extension of bamboo cultivation has been\n    recommended as a means of mitigating distress (Economic Dictionary,\n    vol. i, 373 ff., 386).",
