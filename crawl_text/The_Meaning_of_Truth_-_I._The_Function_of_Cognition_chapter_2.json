        "[Footnote: Read before the Aristotelian Society, December 1,\n1884, and first published in Mind, vol. x (1885).–This, and\nthe following articles have received a very slight verbal\nrevision, consisting mostly in the omission of redundancy.]",
        "The following inquiry is (to use a distinction familiar\nto readers of Mr. Shadworth Hodgson) not an inquiry into\nthe ’how it comes,’ but into the ’what it is’ of\ncognition. What we call acts of cognition are evidently\nrealized through what we call brains and their events,\nwhether there be ’souls’ dynamically connected with the\nbrains or not. But with neither brains nor souls has this\nessay any business to transact. In it we shall simply\nassume that cognition IS produced, somehow, and limit\nourselves to asking what elements it contains, what\nfactors it implies.",
        "Cognition is a function of consciousness. The first factor it\nimplies is therefore a state of consciousness wherein the cognition\nshall take place. Having elsewhere used the word ’feeling’ to\ndesignate generically all states of consciousness considered\nsubjectively, or without respect to their possible function, I shall\nthen say that, whatever elements an act of cognition may imply\nbesides, it at least implies the existence of a FEELING. [If the\nreader share the current antipathy to the word ’feeling,’ he may\nsubstitute for it, wherever I use it, the word ’idea,’ taken in the\nold broad Lockian sense, or he may use the clumsy phrase ’state of\nconsciousness,’ or finally he may say ’thought’ instead.]",
        "Now it is to be observed that the common consent of mankind has\nagreed that some feelings are cognitive and some are simple\nfacts having a subjective, or, what one might almost call a\nphysical, existence, but no such self-transcendent function as\nwould be implied in their being pieces of knowledge. Our task\nis again limited here. We are not to ask, ’How is self-transcendence\npossible?’ We are only to ask, ’How comes it that common sense\nhas assigned a number of cases in which it is assumed not only to be\npossible but actual? And what are the marks used by common sense\nto distinguish those cases from the rest?’ In short, our inquiry is\na chapter in descriptive psychology,–hardly anything more.",
        "Condillac embarked on a quest similar to this by his famous\nhypothesis of a statue to which various feelings were successively\nimparted. Its first feeling was supposed to be one of fragrance. But\nto avoid all possible complication with the question of genesis, let\nus not attribute even to a statue the possession of our imaginary\nfeeling. Let us rather suppose it attached to no matter, nor\nlocalized at any point in space, but left swinging IN VACUO, as\nit were, by the direct creative FIAT of a god. And let us also, to\nescape entanglement with difficulties about the physical or\npsychical nature of its ’object’ not call it a feeling of\nfragrance or of any other determinate sort, but limit ourselves to\nassuming that it is a feeling of Q. What is true of it under this\nabstract name will be no less true of it in any more particular\nshape (such as fragrance, pain, hardness) which the reader may\nsuppose.",
        "Now, if this feeling of Q be the only creation of the god, it will\nof course form the entire universe. And if, to escape the cavils of\nthat large class of persons who believe that SEMPER IDEM SENTIRE AC\nNON SENTIRE are the same, [Footnote:1 ’The Relativity of Knowledge,’\nheld in this sense, is, it may be observed in passing, one of the\noddest of philosophic superstitions. Whatever facts may be cited in\nits favor are due to the properties of nerve-tissue, which may be\nexhausted by too prolonged an excitement. Patients with neuralgias\nthat last unremittingly for days can, however, assure us that\nthe limits of this nerve-law are pretty widely drawn. But if\nwe physically could get a feeling that should last\neternally unchanged, what atom of logical or psychological argument\nis there to prove that it would not be felt as long as it\nlasted, and felt for just what it is, all that time? The reason for\nthe opposite prejudice seems to be our reluctance to think that\nso stupid a thing as such a feeling would necessarily be, should be\nallowed to fill eternity with its presence. An\ninterminable acquaintance, leading to no knowledge-about,–such\nwould be its condition.] we allow the feeling to be of as short a\nduration as they like, that universe will only need to last an\ninfinitesimal part of a second. The feeling in question will thus be\nreduced to its fighting weight, and all that befalls it in the way\nof a cognitive function must be held to befall in the brief\ninstant of its quickly snuffed-out life,–a life, it will also be\nnoticed, that has no other moment of consciousness either preceding\nor following it.",
        "Well now, can our little feeling, thus left alone in the universe,–\nfor the god and we psychological critics may be supposed left out of\nthe account,–can the feeling, I say, be said to have any sort of a\ncognitive function? For it to KNOW, there must be something to be\nknown. What is there, on the present supposition? One may reply,\n’the feeling’s content q.’ But does it not seem more proper to call\nthis the feeling’s QUALITY than its content? Does not the\nword ’content’ suggest that the feeling has already dirempted itself\nas an act from its content as an object? And would it be quite safe\nto assume so promptly that the quality q of a feeling is one and the\nsame thing with a feeling of the quality q? The quality q, so far,\nis an entirely subjective fact which the feeling carries so to speak\nendogenously, or in its pocket. If any one pleases to dignify so\nsimple a fact as this by the name of knowledge, of course\nnothing can prevent him. But let us keep closer to the path of\ncommon usage, and reserve the name knowledge for the cognition of\n’realities,’ meaning by realities things that exist independently of\nthe feeling through which their cognition occurs. If the content of\nthe feeling occur nowhere in the universe outside of the feeling\nitself, and perish with the feeling, common usage refuses to call it\na reality, and brands it as a subjective feature of the\nfeeling’s constitution, or at the most as the feeling’s DREAM.",
        "For the feeling to be cognitive in the specific sense, then, it must\nbe self-transcendent; and we must prevail upon the god to CREATE A\nREALITY OUTSIDE OF IT to correspond to its intrinsic quality Q. Thus\nonly can it be redeemed from the condition of being a solipsism. If\nnow the new created reality RESEMBLE the feeling’s quality Q I say\nthat the feeling may be held by us TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT REALITY.",
        "This first instalment of my thesis is sure to be attacked. But one\nword before defending it ’Reality’ has become our warrant for\ncalling a feeling cognitive; but what becomes our warrant for\ncalling anything reality? The only reply is–the faith of the\npresent critic or inquirer. At every moment of his life he\nfinds himself subject to a belief in SOME realities, even though his\nrealities of this year should prove to be his illusions of the next.\nWhenever he finds that the feeling he is studying contemplates what\nhe himself regards as a reality, he must of course admit the feeling\nitself to be truly cognitive. We are ourselves the critics here; and\nwe shall find our burden much lightened by being allowed to take\nreality in this relative and provisional way. Every science must\nmake some assumptions. Erkenntnisstheoretiker are but fallible\nmortals. When they study the function of cognition, they do it by\nmeans of the same function in themselves. And knowing that the\nfountain cannot go higher than its source, we should promptly\nconfess that our results in this field are affected by our own\nliability to err. THE MOST WE CAN CLAIM IS, THAT WHAT WE SAY ABOUT\nCOGNITION MAY BE COUNTED AS TRUE AS WHAT WE SAY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.\nIf our hearers agree with us about what are to be held ’realities,’\nthey will perhaps also agree to the reality of our doctrine of the\nway in which they are known. We cannot ask for more.",
        "Our terminology shall follow the spirit of these remarks. We will\ndeny the function of knowledge to any feeling whose quality or\ncontent we do not ourselves believe to exist outside of that feeling\nas well as in it. We may call such a feeling a dream if we like; we\nshall have to see later whether we can call it a fiction or an\nerror.",
        "To revert now to our thesis. Some persons will immediately cry out,\n’How CAN a reality resemble a feeling?’ Here we find how wise we\nwere to name the quality of the feeling by an algebraic letter Q. We\nflank the whole difficulty of resemblance between an inner state\nand an outward reality, by leaving it free to any one to postulate\nas the reality whatever sort of thing he thinks CAN resemble a\nfeeling,–if not an outward thing, then another feeling like\nthe first one,–the mere feeling Q in the critic’s mind for example.\nEvading thus this objection, we turn to another which is sure to\nbe urged.",
        "It will come from those philosophers to whom ’thought,’ in the sense\nof a knowledge of relations, is the all in all of mental life; and\nwho hold a merely feeling consciousness to be no better–one would\nsometimes say from their utterances, a good deal worse–than no\nconsciousness at all. Such phrases as these, for example, are common\nto-day in the mouths of those who claim to walk in the footprints\nof Kant and Hegel rather than in the ancestral English paths: ’A\nperception detached from all others, “left out of the heap we call a\nmind,” being out of all relation, has no qualities–is simply\nnothing. We can no more consider it than we can see vacancy.’ ’It is\nsimply in itself fleeting, momentary, unnameable (because while we\nname it it has become another), and for the very same reason\nunknowable, the very negation of knowability.’ ’Exclude from what we\nhave considered real all qualities constituted by relation, we find\nthat none are left.’",
        "Altho such citations as these from the writings of Professor Green\nmight be multiplied almost indefinitely, they would hardly repay\nthe pains of collection, so egregiously false is the doctrine they\nteach. Our little supposed feeling, whatever it may be, from the\ncognitive point of view, whether a bit of knowledge or a dream, is\ncertainly no psychical zero. It is a most positively and definitely\nqualified inner fact, with a complexion all its own. Of course there\nare many mental facts which it is NOT. It knows Q, if Q be a\nreality, with a very minimum of knowledge. It neither dates nor\nlocates it. It neither classes nor names it. And it neither knows\nitself as a feeling, nor contrasts itself with other feelings, nor\nestimates its own duration or intensity. It is, in short, if there\nis no more of it than this, a most dumb and helpless and useless\nkind of thing.",
        "But if we must describe it by so many negations, and if it can say\nnothing ABOUT itself or ABOUT anything else, by what right do we\ndeny that it is a psychical zero? And may not the ’relationists’ be\nright after all?",
        "In the innocent looking word ’about’ lies the solution of this\nriddle; and a simple enough solution it is when frankly looked at. A\nquotation from a too seldom quoted book, the Exploratio Philosophica\nof John Grote (London, 1865), p. 60, will form the best\nintroduction to it.",
        "’Our knowledge,’ writes Grote, ’may be contemplated in either of two\nways, or, to use other words, we may speak in a double manner of\nthe “object” of knowledge. That is, we may either use language thus:\nwe KNOW a thing, a man, etc.; or we may use it thus: we know such\nand such things ABOUT the thing, the man, etc. Language in general,\nfollowing its true logical instinct, distinguishes between these two\napplications of the notion of knowledge, the one being yvwvai,\nnoscere, kennen, connaitre, the other being eidevai, scire, wissen,\nsavoir. In the origin, the former may be considered more what I have\ncalled phenomenal–it is the notion of knowledge as ACQUAINTANCE or\nfamiliarity with what is known; which notion is perhaps more akin to\nthe phenomenal bodily communication, and is less purely\nintellectual than the other; it is the kind of knowledge which we\nhave of a thing by the presentation to the senses or the\nrepresentation of it in picture or type, a Vorstellung. The\nother, which is what we express in judgments or propositions, what\nis embodied in Begriffe or concepts without any necessary\nimaginative representation, is in its origin the more\nintellectual notion of knowledge. There is no reason, however, why\nwe should not express our knowledge, whatever its kind, in\neither manner, provided only we do not confusedly express it, in the\nsame proposition or piece of reasoning, in both.’",
        "Now obviously if our supposed feeling of Q is (if knowledge at all)\nonly knowledge of the mere acquaintance-type, it is milking a he-\n goat, as the ancients would have said, to try to extract from it\nany deliverance ABOUT anything under the sun, even about itself. And\nit is as unjust, after our failure, to turn upon it and call it a\npsychical nothing, as it would be, after our fruitless attack upon\nthe billy-goat, to proclaim the non-lactiferous character of\nthe whole goat-tribe. But the entire industry of the Hegelian school\nin trying to shove simple sensation out of the pale of philosophic\nrecognition is founded on this false issue. It is always the\n’speechlessness’ of sensation, its inability to make any\n’statement,’[Footnote: See, for example, Green’s Introduction to\nHume’s Treatise of Human Nature, p. 36.] that is held to make the\nvery notion of it meaningless, and to justify the student of\nknowledge in scouting it out of existence. ’Significance,’ in the\nsense of standing as the sign of other mental states, is taken to be\nthe sole function of what mental states we have; and from the\nperception that our little primitive sensation has as yet no\nsignificance in this literal sense, it is an easy step to call it\nfirst meaningless, next senseless, then vacuous, and finally to\nbrand it as absurd and inadmissible. But in this universal\nliquidation, this everlasting slip, slip, slip, of\ndirect acquaintance into knowledge-ABOUT, until at last nothing is\nleft about which the knowledge can be supposed to obtain, does not\nall ’significance’ depart from the situation? And when our knowledge\nabout things has reached its never so complicated perfection, must\nthere not needs abide alongside of it and inextricably mixed in with\nit some acquaintance with WHAT things all this knowledge is about?",
        "Now, our supposed little feeling gives a WHAT; and if other feelings\nshould succeed which remember the first, its WHAT may stand as\nsubject or predicate of some piece of knowledge-about, of some\njudgment, perceiving relations between it and other WHATS which\nthe other feelings may know. The hitherto dumb Q will then receive a\nname and be no longer speechless. But every name, as students\nof logic know, has its ’denotation’; and the denotation always means\nsome reality or content, relationless as extra or with its\ninternal relations unanalyzed, like the Q which our\nprimitive sensation is supposed to know. No relation-\nexpressing proposition is possible except on the basis of a\npreliminary acquaintance with such ’facts,’ with such contents, as\nthis. Let the Q be fragrance, let it be toothache, or let it be a\nmore complex kind of feeling, like that of the full-moon swimming in\nher blue abyss, it must first come in that simple shape, and be held\nfast in that first intention, before any knowledge ABOUT it can be\nattained. The knowledge ABOUT it is IT with a context added. Undo\nIT, and what is added cannot be CONtext. [Footnote: If A enters and\nB exclaims, ’Didn’t you see my brother on the stairs?’ we all hold\nthat A may answer, ’I saw him, but didn’t know he was your brother’;\nignorance of brotherhood not abolishing power to see. But those who,\non account of the unrelatedness of the first facts with which we\nbecome acquainted, deny them to be ’known’ to us, ought in\nconsistency to maintain that if A did not perceive the relationship\nof the man on the stairs to B, it was impossible he should\nhave noticed him at all.]",
        "Let us say no more then about this objection, but enlarge our\nthesis, thus: If there be in the universe a Q other than the Q in\nthe feeling, the latter may have acquaintance with an entity\nejective to itself; an acquaintance moreover, which, as mere\nacquaintance, it would be hard to imagine susceptible either of\nimprovement or increase, being in its way complete; and which would\noblige us (so long as we refuse not to call acquaintance\nknowledge) to say not only that the feeling is cognitive, but that\nall qualities of feeling, SO LONG AS THERE IS ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF\nTHEM WHICH THEY RESEMBLE, are feelings OF qualities of existence,\nand perceptions of outward fact.",
        "The point of this vindication of the cognitive function of the first\nfeeling lies, it will be noticed, in the discovery that q does exist\nelsewhere than in it. In case this discovery were not made, we could\nnot be sure the feeling was cognitive; and in case there were\nnothing outside to be discovered, we should have to call the feeling\na dream. But the feeling itself cannot make the discovery. Its own q\nis the only q it grasps; and its own nature is not a particle\naltered by having the self-transcendent function of cognition either\nadded to it or taken away. The function is accidental; synthetic,\nnot analytic; and falls outside and not inside its being. [Footnote:\nIt seems odd to call so important a function accidental, but I do\nnot see how we can mend the matter. Just as, if we start with the\nreality and ask how it may come to be known, we can only reply by\ninvoking a feeling which shall RECONSTRUCT it in its own more\nprivate fashion; so, if we start with the feeling and ask how it may\ncome to know, we can only reply by invoking a reality which shall\nRECONSTRUCT it in its own more public fashion. In either case,\nhowever, the datum we start with remains just what it was. One may\neasily get lost in verbal mysteries about the difference between\nquality of feeling and feeling of quality, between receiving and\nreconstructing the knowledge of a reality. But at the end we must\nconfess that the notion of real cognition involves an\nunmediated dualism of the knower and the known. See Bowne’s\nMetaphysics, New York, 1882, pp. 403-412, and various passages in\nLotze, e.g., Logic, Sec. 308. [’Unmediated’ is a bad word to\nhave used.–1909.]]",
        "A feeling feels as a gun shoots. If there be nothing to be felt or\nhit, they discharge themselves ins blaue hinein. If, however,\nsomething starts up opposite them, they no longer simply shoot or\nfeel, they hit and know.",
        "But with this arises a worse objection than any yet made. We the\ncritics look on and see a real q and a feeling of q; and because the\ntwo resemble each other, we say the one knows the other. But what\nright have we to say this until we know that the feeling of q means\nto stand for or represent just that SAME other q? Suppose, instead\nof one q, a number of real q’s in the field. If the gun shoots and\nhits, we can easily see which one of them it hits. But how can we\ndistinguish which one the feeling knows? It knows the one it stands\nfor. But which one DOES it stand for? It declares no intention in\nthis respect. It merely resembles; it resembles all indifferently;\nand resembling, per se, is not necessarily representing or standing-\nfor at all. Eggs resemble each other, but do not on that account\nrepresent, stand for, or know each other. And if you say this\nis because neither of them is a FEELING, then imagine the world to\nconsist of nothing but toothaches, which ARE feelings, feelings\nresembling each other exactly,–would they know each other the\nbetter for all that?",
        "The case of q being a bare quality like that of toothache-pain is\nquite different from that of its being a concrete individual thing.\nThere is practically no test for deciding whether the feeling of a\nbare quality means to represent it or not. It can DO nothing to the\nquality beyond resembling it, simply because an abstract quality is\na thing to which nothing can be done. Being without context or\nenvironment or principium individuationis, a quiddity with\nno haecceity, a platonic idea, even duplicate editions of such a\nquality (were they possible), would be indiscernible, and no sign\ncould be given, no result altered, whether the feeling I meant to\nstand for this edition or for that, or whether it simply resembled\nthe quality without meaning to stand for it at all.",
        "If now we grant a genuine pluralism of editions to the quality q, by\nassigning to each a CONTEXT which shall distinguish it from its\nmates, we may proceed to explain which edition of it the feeling\nknows, by extending our principle of resemblance to the context too,\nand saying the feeling knows the particular q whose context it most\nexactly duplicates. But here again the theoretic doubt recurs:\nduplication and coincidence, are they knowledge? The gun shows which\nq it points to and hits, by BREAKING it. Until the feeling can show\nus which q it points to and knows, by some equally flagrant token,\nwhy are we not free to deny that it either points to or knows any\none of the REAL q’s at all, and to affirm that the\nword ’resemblance’ exhaustively describes its relation to the\nreality?",
        "Well, as a matter of fact, every actual feeling DOES show us, quite\nas flagrantly as the gun, which q it points to; and practically in\nconcrete cases the matter is decided by an element we have hitherto\nleft out. Let us pass from abstractions to possible instances, and\nask our obliging deus ex machina to frame for us a richer world. Let\nhim send me, for example, a dream of the death of a certain man, and\nlet him simultaneously cause the man to die. How would our practical\ninstinct spontaneously decide whether this were a case of cognition\nof the reality, or only a sort of marvellous coincidence of a\nresembling reality with my dream? Just such puzzling cases as this\nare what the ’society for psychical research’ is busily\ncollecting and trying to interpret in the most reasonable way.",
        "If my dream were the only one of the kind I ever had in my life, if\nthe context of the death in the dream differed in many particulars\nfrom the real death’s context, and if my dream led me to no action\nabout the death, unquestionably we should all call it a strange\ncoincidence, and naught besides. But if the death in the dream had a\nlong context, agreeing point for point with every feature that\nattended the real death; if I were constantly having such\ndreams, all equally perfect, and if on awaking I had a habit of\nACTING immediately as if they were true and so getting ’the start’\nof my more tardily instructed neighbors,–we should in all\nprobability have to admit that I had some mysterious kind of\nclairvoyant power, that my dreams in an inscrutable way meant just\nthose realities they figured, and that the word ’coincidence’ failed\nto touch the root of the matter. And whatever doubts any one\npreserved would completely vanish, if it should appear that from the\nmidst of my dream I had the power of INTERFERING with the course of\nthe reality, and making the events in it turn this way or that,\naccording as I dreamed they should. Then at least it would be\ncertain that my waking critics and my dreaming self were dealing\nwith the SAME.",
        "And thus do men invariably decide such a question. THE FALLING OF\nTHE DREAM’S PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES into the real world, and the\nEXTENT of the resemblance between the two worlds are the criteria\nthey instinctively use. [Footnote: The thoroughgoing objector might,\nit is true, still return to the charge, and, granting a dream which\nshould completely mirror the real universe, and all the actions\ndreamed in which should be instantly matched by duplicate actions in\nthis universe, still insist that this is nothing more than harmony,\nand that it is as far as ever from being made clear whether\nthe dream-world refers to that other world, all of whose details it\nso closely copies. This objection leads deep into metaphysics. I do\nnot impugn its importance, and justice obliges me to say that but\nfor the teachings of my colleague, Dr. Josiah Royce, I should\nneither have grasped its full force nor made my own practical and\npsychological point of view as clear to myself as it is. On this\noccasion I prefer to stick steadfastly to that point of view; but I\nhope that Dr. Royce’s more fundamental criticism of the function of\ncognition may ere long see the light. [I referred in this note to\nRoyce’s religious aspect of philosophy, then about to be published.\nThis powerful book maintained that the notion of REFERRING involved\nthat of an inclusive mind that shall own both the real q and the\nmental q, and use the latter expressly as a representative symbol of\nthe former. At the time I could not refute this transcendentalist\nopinion. Later, largely through the influence of Professor D. S.\nMiller (see his essay ’The meaning of truth and error,’ in the\nPhilosophical Review for 1893, vol. 2 p. 403) I came to see that any\ndefinitely experienceable workings would serve as\nintermediaries quite as well as the absolute mind’s\nintentions would.]] All feeling is for the sake of action, all\nfeeling results in action,–to-day no argument is needed to prove\nthese truths. But by a most singular disposition of nature which we\nmay conceive to have been different, MY FEELINGS ACT UPON THE\nREALITIES WITHIN MY CRITIC’S WORLD. Unless, then, my critic can\nprove that my feeling does not ’point to’ those realities which it\nacts upon, how can he continue to doubt that he and I are alike\ncognizant of one and the same real world? If the action is performed\nin one world, that must be the world the feeling intends; if in\nanother world, THAT is the world the feeling has in mind. If your\nfeeling bear no fruits in my world, I call it utterly detached from\nmy world; I call it a solipsism, and call its world a dream-world.\nIf your toothache do not prompt you to ACT as if I had a toothache,\nnor even as if I had a separate existence; if you neither say to me,\n’I know now how you must suffer!’ nor tell me of a remedy, I deny\nthat your feeling, however it may resemble mine, is really cognizant\nof mine. It gives no SIGN of being cognizant, and such a sign is\nabsolutely necessary to my admission that it is.",
        "Before I can think you to mean my world, you must affect my world;\nbefore I can think you to mean much of it, you must affect much of\nit; and before I can be sure you mean it AS I DO, you must affect it\nJUST AS I SHOULD if I were in your place. Then I, your critic, will\ngladly believe that we are thinking, not only of the same reality,\nbut that we are thinking it ALIKE, and thinking of much of its\nextent.",
        "Without the practical effects of our neighbor’s feelings on our own\nworld, we should never suspect the existence of our\nneighbor’s feelings at all, and of course should never\nfind ourselves playing the critic as we do in this article. The\nconstitution of nature is very peculiar. In the world of each of us\nare certain objects called human bodies, which move about and act on\nall the other objects there, and the occasions of their action are\nin the main what the occasions of our action would be, were they our\nbodies. They use words and gestures, which, if we used them, would\nhave thoughts behind them,–no mere thoughts uberhaupt, however, but\nstrictly determinate thoughts. I think you have the notion of\nfire in general, because I see you act towards this fire in my room\njust as I act towards it,–poke it and present your person towards\nit, and so forth. But that binds me to believe that if you feel\n’fire’ at all, THIS is the fire you feel. As a matter of fact,\nwhenever we constitute ourselves into psychological critics, it is\nnot by dint of discovering which reality a feeling ’resembles’ that\nwe find out which reality it means. We become first aware of which\none it means, and then we suppose that to be the one it resembles.\nWe see each other looking at the same objects, pointing to them and\nturning them over in various ways, and thereupon we hope and trust\nthat all of our several feelings resemble the reality and each\nother. But this is a thing of which we are never theoretically sure.\nStill, it would practically be a case of grubelsucht, if a ruffian\nwere assaulting and drubbing my body, to spend much time in subtle\nspeculation either as to whether his vision of my body resembled\nmine, or as to whether the body he really MEANT to insult were not\nsome body in his mind’s eye, altogether other from my own. The\npractical point of view brushes such metaphysical cobwebs away. If\nwhat he have in mind be not MY body, why call we it a body at all?\nHis mind is inferred by me as a term, to whose existence we trace\nthe things that happen. The inference is quite void if the term,\nonce inferred, be separated from its connection with the body\nthat made me infer it, and connected with another that is not mine\nat all. No matter for the metaphysical puzzle of how our two minds,\nthe ruffian’s and mine, can mean the same body. Men who see each\nother’s bodies sharing the same space, treading the same earth,\nsplashing the same water, making the same air resonant, and pursuing\nthe same game and eating out of the same dish, will never\npractically believe in a pluralism of solipsistic worlds.",
        "Where, however, the actions of one mind seem to take no effect in\nthe world of the other, the case is different. This is what happens\nin poetry and fiction. Every one knows Ivanhoe, for example; but so\nlong as we stick to the story pure and simple without regard to\nthe facts of its production, few would hesitate to admit that there\nare as many different Ivanhoes as there are different minds\ncognizant of the story. [Footnote: That is, there is no REAL\n’Ivanhoe,’ not even the one in Sir Walter Scott’s mind as he was\nwriting the story. That one is only the FIRST one of the Ivanhoe-\nsolipsisms. It is quite true we can make it the real Ivanhoe if we\nlike, and then say that the other Ivanhoes know it or do not know\nit, according as they refer to and resemble it or no. This is done\nby bringing in Sir Walter Scott himself as the author of the real\nIvanhoe, and so making a complex object of both. This object,\nhowever, is not a story pure and simple. It has dynamic\nrelations with the world common to the experience of all the\nreaders. Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe got itself printed in volumes\nwhich we all can handle, and to any one of which we can refer to\nsee which of our versions be the true one, i.e., the original one\nof Scott himself. We can see the manuscript; in short we can\nget back to the Ivanhoe in Scott’s mind by many an avenue\nand channel of this real world of our experience,–a thing we can by\nno means do with either the Ivanhoe or the Rebecca, either the\nTemplar or the Isaac of York, of the story taken simply as such, and\ndetached from the conditions of its production. Everywhere, then, we\nhave the same test: can we pass continuously from two objects in two\nminds to a third object which seems to be in BOTH minds, because\neach mind feels every modification imprinted on it by the other? If\nso, the first two objects named are derivatives, to say the least,\nfrom the same third object, and may be held, if they resemble each\nother, to refer to one and the same reality.] The fact that all\nthese Ivanhoes RESEMBLE each other does not prove the contrary. But\nif an alteration invented by one man in his version were to\nreverberate immediately through all the other versions, and\nproduce changes therein, we should then easily agree that all these\nthinkers were thinking the SAME Ivanhoe, and that, fiction or no\nfiction, it formed a little world common to them all.",
        "Having reached this point, we may take up our thesis and improve it\nagain. Still calling the reality by the name of q and letting\nthe critic’s feeling vouch for it, we can say that any other feeling\nwill be held cognizant of q, provided it both resemble q, and refer\nto q, as shown by its either modifying q directly, or modifying some\nother reality, p or r, which the critic knows to be continuous with\nq. Or more shortly, thus: THE FEELING OF q KNOWS WHATEVER REALITY IT\nRESEMBLES, AND EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OPERATES ON. If it\nresemble without operating, it is a dream; if it operate without\nresembling, it is an error. [Footnote: Among such errors are those\ncases in which our feeling operates on a reality which it does\npartially resemble, and yet does not intend: as for instance, when\nI take up your umbrella, meaning to take my own. I cannot be said\nhere either to know your umbrella, or my own, which latter my\nfeeling more completely resembles. I am mistaking them both,\nmisrepresenting their context, etc.",
        "We have spoken in the text as if the critic were necessarily one\nmind, and the feeling criticised another. But the criticised feeling\nand its critic may be earlier and later feelings of the same mind,\nand here it might seem that we could dispense with the notion of\noperating, to prove that critic and criticised are referring to and\nmeaning to represent the SAME. We think we see our past feelings\ndirectly, and know what they refer to without appeal. At the worst,\nwe can always fix the intention of our present feeling and MAKE it\nrefer to the same reality to which any one of our past feelings may\nhave referred. So we need no ’operating’ here, to make sure that the\nfeeling and its critic mean the same real q. Well, all the better if\nthis is so! We have covered the more complex and difficult case in\nour text, and we may let this easier one go. The main thing\nat present is to stick to practical psychology, and ignore\nmetaphysical difficulties.",
        "One more remark. Our formula contains, it will be observed, nothing\nto correspond to the great principle of cognition laid down by\nProfessor Ferrier in his Institutes of Metaphysic and apparently\nadopted by all the followers of Fichte, the principle, namely, that\nfor knowledge to be constituted there must be knowledge of the\nknowing mind along with whatever else is known: not q, as we have\nsupposed, but q PLUS MYSELF, must be the least I can know. It is\ncertain that the common sense of mankind never dreams of using any\nsuch principle when it tries to discriminate between conscious\nstates that are knowledge and conscious states that are not. So\nthat Ferrier’s principle, if it have any relevancy at all, must\nhave relevancy to the metaphysical possibility of consciousness\nat large, and not to the practically recognized constitution\nof cognitive consciousness. We may therefore pass it by\nwithout further notice here.] It is to be feared that the reader may\nconsider this formula rather insignificant and obvious, and hardly\nworth the labor of so many pages, especially when he considers that\nthe only cases to which it applies are percepts, and that the whole\nfield of symbolic or conceptual thinking seems to elude its grasp.\nWhere the reality is either a material thing or act, or a state of\nthe critic’s consciousness, I may both mirror it in my mind and\noperate upon it–in the latter case indirectly, of course–as\nsoon as I perceive it. But there are many cognitions, universally\nallowed to be such, which neither mirror nor operate on their\nrealities.",
        "In the whole field of symbolic thought we are universally held both\nto intend, to speak of, and to reach conclusions about–to know in\nshort–particular realities, without having in our subjective\nconsciousness any mind-stuff that resembles them even in a remote\ndegree. We are instructed about them by language which awakens no\nconsciousness beyond its sound; and we know WHICH realities they\nare by the faintest and most fragmentary glimpse of some remote\ncontext they may have and by no direct imagination of themselves. As\nminds may differ here, let me speak in the first person. I am sure\nthat my own current thinking has WORDS for its almost exclusive\nsubjective material, words which are made intelligible by being\nreferred to some reality that lies beyond the horizon of direct\nconsciousness, and of which I am only aware as of a terminal\nMORE existing in a certain direction, to which the words might lead\nbut do not lead yet. The SUBJECT, or TOPIC, of the words is\nusually something towards which I mentally seem to pitch them in a\nbackward way, almost as I might jerk my thumb over my shoulder to\npoint at something, without looking round, if I were only entirely\nsure that it was there. The UPSHOT, or CONCLUSION, of the words is\nsomething towards which I seem to incline my head forwards, as if\ngiving assent to its existence, tho all my mind’s eye catches sight\nof may be some tatter of an image connected with it, which tatter,\nhowever, if only endued with the feeling of familiarity and reality,\nmakes me feel that the whole to which it belongs is rational and\nreal, and fit to be let pass.",
        " Here then is cognitive consciousness on a large scale, and yet what\nit knows, it hardly resembles in the least degree. The formula last\nlaid down for our thesis must therefore be made more complete. We\nmay now express it thus: A PERCEPT KNOWS WHATEVER REALITY IT\nDIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OPERATES ON AND RESEMBLES; ACONCEPTUAL\nFEELING, OR THOUGHT KNOWS A REALITY, WHENEVER IT ACTUALLY OR\nPOTENTIALLY TERMINATES IN A PERCEPT THAT OPERATES ON, OR RESEMBLES\nTHAT REALITY, OR IS OTHERWISE CONNECTED WITH IT OR WITH ITS CONTEXT.\nThe latter percept may be either sensation or sensorial idea; and\nwhen I say the thought must TERMINATE in such a percept, I mean that\nit must ultimately be capable of leading up thereto,–by the way of\npractical",
        " Is an incomplete ’thought about’ that reality, that reality is its\n’topic,’ etc. experience, if the terminal feeling be a sensation; by\nthe way of logical or habitual suggestion, if it be only an image in\nthe mind.",
        "Let an illustration make this plainer. I open the first book I take\nup, and read the first sentence that meets my eye: ’Newton saw\nthe handiwork of God in the heavens as plainly as Paley in the\nanimal kingdom.’ I immediately look back and try to analyze the\nsubjective state in which I rapidly apprehended this sentence as I\nread it. In the first place there was an obvious feeling that the\nsentence was intelligible and rational and related to the world of\nrealities. There was also a sense of agreement or harmony between\n’Newton,’ ’Paley,’ and ’God.’ There was no apparent image connected\nwith the words ’heavens,’ or ’handiwork,’ or ’God’; they were\nwords merely. With ’animal kingdom’ I think there was the faintest\nconsciousness (it may possibly have been an image of the steps) of\nthe Museum of Zoology in the town of Cambridge where I write. With\n’Paley’ there was an equally faint consciousness of a small\ndark leather book; and with ’Newton’ a pretty distinct vision of the\nright-hand lower corner of curling periwig. This is all the mind-\nstuff I can discover in my first consciousness of the meaning of\nthis sentence, and I am afraid that even not all of this would have\nbeen present had I come upon the sentence in a genuine reading of\nthe book, and not picked it out for an experiment. And yet my\nconsciousness was truly cognitive. The sentence is ’about realities’\nwhich my psychological critic–for we must not forget him–\nacknowledges to be such, even as he acknowledges my distinct feeling\nthat they ARE realities, and my acquiescence in the general\nrightness of what I read of them, to be true knowledge on my part.",
        "Now what justifies my critic in being as lenient as this? This\nsingularly inadequate consciousness of mine, made up of symbols\nthat neither resemble nor affect the realities they stand for,–how\ncan he be sure it is cognizant of the very realities he has himself\nin mind?",
        "He is sure because in countless like cases he has seen such\ninadequate and symbolic thoughts, by developing themselves,\nterminate in percepts that practically modified and presumably\nresembled his own. By ’developing’ themselves is meant obeying their\ntendencies, following up the suggestions nascently present in them,\nworking in the direction in which they seem to point, clearing up\nthe penumbra, making distinct the halo, unravelling the\nfringe, which is part of their composition, and in the midst of\nwhich their more substantive kernel of subjective content seems\nconsciously to lie. Thus I may develop my thought in the\nPaley direction by procuring the brown leather volume and bringing\nthe passages about the animal kingdom before the critic’s eyes. I\nmay satisfy him that the words mean for me just what they mean for\nhim, by showing him IN CONCRETO the very animals and their\narrangements, of which the pages treat. I may get Newton’s works and\nportraits; or if I follow the line of suggestion of the wig, I may\nsmother my critic in seventeenth-century matters pertaining to\nNewton’s environment, to show that the word ’Newton’ has the same\nLOCUS and relations in both our minds. Finally I may, by act and\nword, persuade him that what I mean by God and the heavens and\nthe analogy of the handiworks, is just what he means also.",
        "My demonstration in the last resort is to his SENSES. My thought\nmakes me act on his senses much as he might himself act on\nthem, were he pursuing the consequences of a perception of his own.\nPractically then MY thought terminates in HIS realities. He\nwillingly supposes it, therefore, to be OF them, and inwardly to\nRESEMBLE what his own thought would be, were it of the same symbolic\nsort as mine. And the pivot and fulcrum and support of his\nmental persuasion, is the sensible operation which my thought leads\nme, or may lead, to effect–the bringing of Paley’s book, of\nNewton’s portrait, etc., before his very eyes.",
        "In the last analysis, then, we believe that we all know and think\nabout and talk about the same world, because WE BELIEVE OUR\nPERCEPTS ARE POSSESSED BY US IN COMMON. And we believe this because\nthe percepts of each one of us seem to be changed in consequence of\nchanges in the percepts of someone else. What I am for you is in the\nfirst instance a percept of your own. Unexpectedly, however, I open\nand show you a book, uttering certain sounds the while. These acts\nare also your percepts, but they so resemble acts of yours with\nfeelings prompting them, that you cannot doubt I have the\nfeelings too, or that the book is one book felt in both our worlds.\nThat it is felt in the same way, that my feelings of it resemble\nyours, is something of which we never can be sure, but which we\nassume as the simplest hypothesis that meets the case. As a matter\nof fact, we never ARE sure of it, and, as ERKENNTNISSTHEORETIKER, we\ncan only say that of feelings that should NOT resemble each other,\nboth could not know the same thing at the same time in the same way.\n[Footnote: Though both might terminate in the same thing and be\nincomplete thoughts ’about’ it.] If each holds to its own percept\nas the reality, it is bound to say of the other percept, that,\nthough it may INTEND that reality, and prove this by working change\nupon it, yet, if it do not resemble it, it is all false and wrong.\n[Footnote: The difference between Idealism and Realism is\nimmaterial here. What is said in the text is consistent with\neither theory. A law by which my percept shall change yours\ndirectly is no more mysterious than a law by which it shall\nfirst change a physical reality, and then the reality change\nyours. In either case you and I seem knit into a continuous\nworld, and not to form a pair of solipsisms.]",
        "If this be so of percepts, how much more so of higher modes of\nthought! Even in the sphere of sensation individuals are\nprobably different enough. Comparative study of the simplest\nconceptual elements seems to show a wider divergence still. And when\nit comes to general theories and emotional attitudes towards life,\nit is indeed time to say with Thackeray, ’My friend, two different\nuniverses walk about under your hat and under mine.’",
        "What can save us at all and prevent us from flying asunder into a\nchaos of mutually repellent solipsisms? Through what can our\nseveral minds commune? Through nothing but the mutual resemblance of\nthose of our perceptual feelings which have this power of modifying\none another, WHICH ARE MERE DUMB KNOWLEDGES-OF-ACQUAINTANCE, and\nwhich must also resemble their realities or not know them aright at\nall. In such pieces of knowledge-of-acquaintance all our knowledge-\nabout must end, and carry a sense of this possible termination as\npart of its content. These percepts, these termini, these sensible\nthings, these mere matters-of-acquaintance, are the only\nrealities we ever directly know, and the whole history of our\nthought is the history of our substitution of one of them for\nanother, and the reduction of the substitute to the status of a\nconceptual sign. Contemned though they be by some thinkers, these\nsensations are the mother-earth, the anchorage, the stable rock,\nthe first and last limits, the terminus a quo and the terminus ad\nquem of the mind. to find such sensational termini should be our aim\nwith all our higher thought. They end discussion; they destroy the\nfalse conceit of knowledge; and without them we are all at sea with\neach other’s meaning. If two men act alike on a percept, they\nbelieve themselves to feel alike about it; if not, they may suspect\nthey know it in differing ways. We can never be sure we understand\neach other till we are able to bring the matter to this test.\n[Footnote: ’There  is no distinction of meaning so fine as to\nconsist in anything but a possible difference of practice.... It\nappears, then, that the rule for attaining the [highest] grade\nof clearness of apprehension is as follows: Consider what\neffects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we\nconceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our\nconception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the\nobject.’ Charles S. Peirce: ’How to make our Ideas clear,’ in\nPopular Science Monthly, New York, January, 1878, p. 293.] This is\nwhy metaphysical discussions are so much like fighting with the air;\nthey have no practical issue of a sensational kind. ’Scientific’\ntheories, on the other hand, always terminate in definite\npercepts. You can deduce a possible sensation from your theory and,\ntaking me into your laboratory, prove that your theory is true of my\nworld by giving me the sensation then and there. Beautiful is the\nflight of conceptual reason through the upper air of truth.\nNo wonder philosophers are dazzled by it still, and no wonder they\nlook with some disdain at the low earth of feeling from which the\ngoddess launched herself aloft. But woe to her if she return not\nhome to its acquaintance; Nirgends haften dann die unsicheren\nSohlen–every crazy wind will take her, and, like a fire-balloon at\nnight, she will go out among the stars.",
        "NOTE.–The reader will easily see how much of the account of the\ntruth-function developed later in Pragmatism was already explicit in\nthis earlier article, and how much came to be defined later. In this\nearlier article we find distinctly asserted:–",
        "1. The reality, external to the true idea;",
        "2. The critic, reader, or epistemologist, with his own belief, as\nwarrant for this reality’s existence;",
        "3. The experienceable environment, as the vehicle or\nmedium connecting knower with known, and yielding the\ncognitive RELATION;",
        "4. The notion of POINTING, through this medium, to the reality, as\none condition of our being said to know it;",
        "5. That of RESEMBLING it, and eventually AFFECTING it, as\ndetermining the pointing to IT and not to something else.",
        "6. The elimination of the ’epistemological gulf,’ so that the whole\ntruth-relation falls inside of the continuities of\nconcrete experience, and is constituted of particular processes,\nvarying with every object and subject, and susceptible of being\ndescribed in detail.",
        "The defects in this earlier account are:–",
        "1. The possibly undue prominence given to resembling, which altho a\nfundamental function in knowing truly, is so often dispensed with;",
        "2. The undue emphasis laid upon operating on the object itself,\nwhich in many cases is indeed decisive of that being what we refer\nto, but which is often lacking, or replaced by operations on other\nthings related to the object.",
        "3. The imperfect development of the generalized notion of the\nWORKABILITY of the feeling or idea as equivalent to\nthat SATISFACTORY ADAPTATION to the particular reality,\nwhich constitutes the truth of the idea. It is this more generalized\nnotion, as covering all such specifications as pointing, fitting,\noperating or resembling, that distinguishes the developed view\nof Dewey, Schiller, and myself.",
