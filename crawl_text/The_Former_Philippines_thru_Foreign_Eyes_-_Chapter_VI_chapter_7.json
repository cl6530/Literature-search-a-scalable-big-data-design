        "[To Bulacan by steamer.]  My first excursion was to the province of\nBulacan, on the northern shore of the Bay of Manila. A couple of\nhours brought the steamer to the bar of Binuanga (not Bincanga as\nit is called in Coello’s map), and a third to Bulacan, the capital\nof the province, situated on the flat banks of an influent of the\nPampanga delta. I was the only European passenger, the others were\ncomposed of Tagalogs, mestizos, and a few Chinese; the first more\nparticularly were represented by women, who are generally charged with\nthe management of all business affairs, for which they are much better\nfitted than the men. As a consequence, there are usually more women\nthan men seen in the streets, and it appears to be an admitted fact\nthat the female births are more numerous than the male. According,\nhowever, to the church-record which I looked through, the reverse was,\nat any rate in the eastern provinces, formerly the case.",
        "[Carromatas.]  At the landing-place a number of carromatas were waiting\nfor us,–brightly painted, shallow, two-wheeled boxes, provided with\nan awning, and harnessed to a couple of horses, in which strangers\nwith money to spend are quickly driven anywhere they may desire.",
        "[Town of Bulacan.]  The town of Bulacan contains from 11,000 to 12,000\ninhabitants; but a month before my arrival, the whole of it, with the\nexception of the church and a few stone houses, had been burnt to the\nground. All were therefore occupied in building themselves new houses,\nwhich, oddly enough, but very practically, were commenced at the roof,\nlike houses in a drawing. Long rows of roofs composed of palm-leaves\nand bamboos were laid in readiness on the ground, and in the meantime\nwere used as tents.",
        "[Frequence of fires.]  Similar destructive fires are very common. The\nhouses, which with few exceptions are built of bamboo and wood, become\nperfectly parched in the hot season, dried into so much touchwood by\nthe heat of the sun. Their inhabitants are extremely careless about\nfire, and there are no means whatever of extinguishing it. If anything\ncatches fire on a windy day, the entire village, as a rule, is utterly\ndone for. During my stay in Bulacan, the whole suburb of San Miguel,\nin the neighborhood of Manila, was burnt down, with the exception of\nthe house of a Swiss friend of mine, which owed its safety to the\nvigorous use of a private fire-engine, and the intermediation of a\nsmall garden full of bananas, whose stems full of sap stopped the\nprogress of the flames.",
        "[To Calumpit by carriage.]  I travelled to Calumpit, a distance of\nthree leagues, in the handsome carriage of an hospitable friend. The\nroads were good, and were continuously shaded by fruit-trees, coco and\nareca palms. The aspect of this fruitful province reminded me of the\nrichest districts of Java; but the pueblos here exhibited more comfort\nthan the desas there. The houses were more substantial; numerous roomy\nconstructions of wood, in many cases, even, of stone, denoted in every\nisland the residence of official and local magnates. But while even\nthe poorer Javanese always give their wicker huts a smart appearance,\nborder the roads of their villages with blooming hedges, and display\neverywhere a sense of neatness and cleanliness, there were here far\nfewer evidences of taste to be met with. I missed too the alun-alun,\nthat pretty and carefully tended open square, which, shaded by waringa\ntrees, is to be met with in every village in Java. And the quantity\nand variety of the fruit trees, under whose leaves the desas of Java\nare almost hidden, were by no means as great in this province, although\nit is the garden of the Philippines, as in its Dutch prototype.",
        "[Calumpit.]  I reached Calumpit towards evening, just as a procession,\nresplendent with flags and torches, and melodious with song, was\nmarching round the stately church, whose worthy priest, on the strength\nof a letter of introduction from Madrid, gave me a most hospitable\nreception. Calumpit, a prosperous place of 12,250 inhabitants, is\nsituated at the junction of the Quingua and Pampanga rivers, in an\nextremely fruitful plain, fertilized by the frequent overflowing of\nthe two streams.",
        "[Mt. Arayat.]  About six leagues to the north-west of Calumpit,\nMount Arayat, a lofty, isolated, conical hill, lifts its head. Seen\nfrom Calumpit, its western slope meets the horizon at an angle of 20°,\nits eastern at one of 25°; and the profile of its summit has a gentle\ninclination of from 4° to 5°.",
        "[Picking fish.]  At Calumpit I saw some Chinese catching fish in a\npeculiar fashion. Across the lower end of the bed of a brook which\nwas nearly dried up, and in which there were only a few rivulets\nleft running, they had fastened a hurdle of bamboo, and thrown up a\nshallow dam behind it. The water which collected was thrown over the\ndam with a long-handled winnowing shovel. The shovel was tied to a\nbamboo frame work ten feet high, the elasticity of which made the\nwork much easier. As soon as the pool was emptied, the fisherman\nwas easily able to pick out of the mud a quantity of small fish\n(Ophiocephalus vagus). These fishes, which are provided with peculiar\norganisms to facilitate respiration, at any rate, enabling them to\nremain for some considerable time on dry land, are in the wet season\nso numerous in the ditches, ponds, and rice-fields, that they can\nbe killed with a stick. When the water sinks they also retire, or,\naccording to Professor Semper, bore deeply into the ooze at the bottom\nof the watercourses, where, protected by a hard crust of earth from\nthe persecutions of mankind, they sleep away the winter. This Chinese\nmethod of fishing seems well adapted to the habits of the fish. The\ncircumstances that the dam is only constructed at the lower end of\nthe watercourse, and that it is there that the fish are to be met\nwith in the greatest numbers, seem to indicate that they can travel\nin the ooze, and that as the brooks and ditches get dried up, they\nseek the larger water channels.",
        "[To Baliwag.]  Following the Quingua in its upward and eastward\ncourse as it meandered through a well-cultivated and luxuriantly\nfertile country, past stone-built churches and chapels which grouped\nthemselves with the surrounding palm-trees and bamboo-bushes into\nsylvan vignettes, Father Llano’s four-horsed carriage brought me to\nthe important town of Baliwag, the industry of which is celebrated\nbeyond the limits of the province.",
        "[Board houses and their furniture.]  I visited several families and\nreceived a friendly reception from all of them. The houses were built\nof boards and were placed upon piles elevated five feet above the\nground. Each consisted of a spacious dwelling apartment which opened on\none side into the kitchen, and on the other on to an open space, the\nazotea; a lofty roof of palm-trees spread itself above the dwelling,\nthe entrance to which was through the azotea. The latter was half\ncovered by the roof I have just mentioned. The floor was composed\nof slats an inch in width, laid half that distance apart. Chairs,\ntables, benches, a cupboard, a few small ornaments, a mirror, and some\nlithographs in frames, composed the furniture of the interior. The\ncleanliness of the house and the arrangement of its contents testified\nto the existence of order and prosperity.",
        "[Tapis weaving.]  I found the women in almost all the houses occupied\nin weaving tapis, which have a great reputation in the Manila\nmarket. They are narrow, thickly-woven silk scarves, six varas in\nlength, with oblique white stripes on a dark-brown ground. They are\nworn above the sarong.",
        "[Petaca cigar cases.]  Baliwag is also especially famous for its\npetaca [60]cigar-cases, which surpass all others in delicacy of\nworkmanship. They are not made of straw, but of fine strips of Spanish\ncane, and particularly from the lower ends of the leaf-stalks of the\ncalamusart, which is said to grow only in the province of Nueva Ecija.",
        "[Preparation of material.]  A bundle of a hundred selected stalks,\na couple of feet long, costs about six reals. When these stalks have\nbeen split lengthways into four or five pieces, the inner wood is\nremoved, till nothing but the outer part remains. The thin strips\nthus obtained are drawn by the hand between a convex block and a\nknife fixed in a sloping position, and between a couple of steel\nblades which nearly meet.",
        "[Costly weaving.]  It is a task requiring much patience and\npractice. In the first operation, as a rule, quite one-half of the\nstems are broken, and in the second more than half, so that scarcely\ntwenty per cent of the stalks survive the final process. In very fine\nmatting the proportionate loss is still greater. The plaiting is done\non wooden cylinders. A case of average workmanship, which costs two\ndollars on the spot, can be manufactured in six days’ uninterrupted\nlabor. Cigar-cases of exceptionally intricate workmanship, made to\norder for a connoisseur, frequently cost upwards of fifty dollars.",
        "[Volcanic stone quarries.]  Following the Quingua from Baliwag up its\nstream, we passed several quarries, where we saw the thickly-packed\nstrata of volcanic stone which is used as a building material. The\nbanks of the river are thickly studded with prickly bamboos from\nten to twelve feet high. The water overflows in the rainy season,\nand floods the plain for a great distance. Hence the many shells of\nlarge freshwater mussels which are to be seen lying on the earth which\ncovers the volcanic deposit. The country begins to get hilly in the\nneighborhood of Tobog, a small place with no church of its own, and\ndependent for its services upon the priest of the next parish. The\ngentle slopes of the hills are, as in Java, cut into terraces and\nused for the cultivation of rice. Except at Lucban I have never\nobserved similar sawas anywhere else in the Philippines. Several small\nsugar-fields, which, however, the people do not as yet understand\nhow to manage properly, show that the rudiments of agricultural\nprosperity are already in existence. The roads are partly covered\nwith awnings, beneath which benches are placed affording repose to\nthe weary traveller. I never saw these out of this province. One\nmight fancy oneself in one of the most fertile and thickly-populated\ndistricts of Java.",
        "[A convento and the parish priest.] I passed the night in a convento,\nas the dwelling of the parish priest is called in the Philippines. It\nwas extremely dirty, and the priest, an Augustinian, was full of\nproselytish ardor. I had to undergo a long geographical examination\nabout the difference between Prussia and Russia; was asked whether\nthe great city of Nuremberg was the capital of the grand-duchy or of\nthe empire of Russia; learnt that the English were on the point of\nreturning to the bosom of the Catholic Church, and that the “others\"\nwould soon follow, and was, in short, in spite of the particular\nrecommendation of Father Llanos, very badly received. Some little time\nafterwards I fell into the hands of two young Capuchins, who tried to\nconvert me, but who, with the exception of this little impertinence,\ntreated me capitally. They gave me pâtés de foie gras boiled in water,\nwhich I quickly recognized by the truffles swimming about in the\ngrease. To punish them for their importunity I refrained from telling\nmy hosts the right way to cook the pâtés, which I had the pleasure of\nafterwards eating in the forest, as I easily persuaded them to sell\nme the tins they had left. These are the only two occasions on which\nI was subjected to this kind of annoyance during my eighteen months’\nresidence in the Philippines.",
        "[Arrangements for travellers.] The traveller who is provided\nwith a passport is, however, by no means obliged to rely upon\npriestly hospitality, as he needs must do in many isolated parts of\nEurope. Every village, every hamlet, has its commonhouse, called casa\nreal or tribunal, in which he can take up his quarters and be supplied\nwith provisions at the market price, a circumstance that I was not\nacquainted with on the occasion of my first trip. The traveller is\ntherefore in this respect perfectly independent, at least in theory,\nthough in practice he will often scarcely be able to avoid putting\nup at the conventos in the more isolated parts of the country. In\nthese the priest, perhaps the only white man for miles around, is\nwith difficulty persuaded to miss the opportunity of housing such\na rare guest, to whom he is only too anxious to give up the best\nbedroom in his dwelling, and to offer everything that his kitchen\nand cellar can afford. Everything is placed before the guest in such\na spirit of sincere and undisguised friendliness, that he feels no\nobligation, but on the contrary easily persuades himself that he is\ndoing his host a favor by prolonging his stay. Upon one occasion,\nwhen I had determined, in spite of an invitation from the padre,\nto occupy the casa real, just as I was beginning to instal myself,\nthe priest appeared upon the scene with the municipal officials and a\nband of music which was in the neighborhood pending the preparations\nfor a religious festival. He made them lift me up, chair and all,\nand with music and general rejoicing carried me off to his own house.",
        "[Kupang iron-foundry.] On the following day I paid a visit to Kupang,\nan iron-foundry lying to the N.N.E of Angat, escorted by two armed\nmen, whose services I was pressed to accept, as the district had a bad\nreputation for robberies. After travelling three or four miles in a\nnortherly direction, we crossed the Banauon, at that time a mere brook\nmeandering through shingle, but in the rainy season an impetuous stream\nmore than a hundred feet broad; and in a couple of hours we reached the\niron-works, an immense shed lying in the middle of the forest, with\na couple of wings at each end, in which the manager, an Englishman,\nwho had been wrecked some years before in Samar, lived with his wife,\na pretty mestiza. If I laid down my handkerchief, my pencil, or any\nother object, the wife immediately locked them up to protect them from\nthe kleptomania of her servants. These poor people, whose enterprise\nwas not a very successful one, had to lead a wretched life. Two years\nbefore my visit a band of twenty-seven robbers burst into the place,\nsacked the house, and threw its mistress, who was alone with her\nmaid at the time, out of the window. She fortunately alighted without\nreceiving any serious hurt, but the maid, whom terror caused to jump\nout of the window also, died of the injuries she received. The robbers,\nwho turned out to be miners and residents in Angat, were easily caught,\nand, when I was there, had already spent a couple of years in prison\nawaiting their trial.",
        "[A negrito family.] I met a negrito family here who had friendly\nrelations with the people in the iron-works, and were in the habit\nof exchanging the produce of the forest with them for provisions. The\nfather of this family accompanied me on a hunting expedition. He was\narmed with a bow and a couple of arrows. The arrows had spear-shaped\niron points a couple of inches long; one of them had been dipped\ninto arrow-poison, a mixture that looked like black tar. The women\nhad guitars (tabaua) similar to those used by the Mintras in the\nMalay peninsula. They were made of pieces of bamboo a foot long,\nto which strings of split chair-cane were fastened. [61]",
        "[Unwelcome hospitality.] Upon my return, to avoid spending the night\nat the wretched convento where I had left my servant with my luggage,\nI took the advice of my friends at the iron-works and started late,\nin order to arrive at the priest’s after ten o’clock at night; for\nI knew that the padre shut up his house at ten, and that I could\ntherefore sleep, without offending him, beneath the roof of a wealthy\nmestizo, an acquaintance of theirs. About half-past ten I reached\nthe latter’s house, and sat down to table with the merry women of\nthe family, who were just having their supper. Suddenly my friend the\nparson made his appearance from an inner room, where with a couple of\nAugustinian friars, he had been playing cards with the master of the\nhouse. He immediately began to compliment me upon my good fortune,\n“for had you been but one minute later,” said he, “you certainly\nwouldn’t have got into the convento.”",
