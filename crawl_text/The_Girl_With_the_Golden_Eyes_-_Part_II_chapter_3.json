        "Nevertheless, there is in Paris a proportion of privileged beings to\nwhom this excessive movement of industries, interests, affairs, arts,\nand gold is profitable. These beings are women. Although they also\nhave a thousand secret causes which, here more than elsewhere, destroy\ntheir physiognomy, there are to be found in the feminine world little\nhappy colonies, who live in Oriental fashion and can preserve their\nbeauty; but these women rarely show themselves on foot in the streets,\nthey lie hid like rare plants who only unfold their petals at certain\nhours, and constitute veritable exotic exceptions. However, Paris is\nessentially the country of contrasts. If true sentiments are rare\nthere, there also are to be found, as elsewhere, noble friendships and\nunlimited devotion. On this battlefield of interests and passions,\njust as in the midst of those marching societies where egoism\ntriumphs, where every one is obliged to defend himself, and which we\ncall armies, it seems as though sentiments liked to be complete when\nthey showed themselves, and are sublime by juxtaposition. So it is\nwith faces. In Paris one sometimes sees in the aristocracy, set like\nstars, the ravishing faces of young people, the fruit of quite\nexceptional manners and education. To the youthful beauty of the\nEnglish stock they unite the firmness of Southern traits. The fire of\ntheir eyes, a delicious bloom on their lips, the lustrous black of\ntheir soft locks, a white complexion, a distinguished caste of\nfeatures, render them the flowers of the human race, magnificent to\nbehold against the mass of other faces, worn, old, wrinkled, and\ngrimacing. So women, too, admire such young people with that eager\npleasure which men take in watching a pretty girl, elegant, gracious,\nand embellished with all the virginal charms with which our\nimagination pleases to adorn the perfect woman. If this hurried glance\nat the population of Paris has enabled us to conceive the rarity of a\nRaphaelesque face, and the passionate admiration which such an one\nmust inspire at the first sight, the prime interest of our history\nwill have been justified. Quod erat demonstrandum–if one may be\npermitted to apply scholastic formulae to the science of manners.",
        "Upon one of those fine spring mornings, when the leaves, although\nunfolded, are not yet green, when the sun begins to gild the roofs,\nand the sky is blue, when the population of Paris issues from its\ncells to swarm along the boulevards, glides like a serpent of a\nthousand coils through the Rue de la Paix towards the Tuileries,\nsaluting the hymeneal magnificence which the country puts on; on one\nof these joyous days, then, a young man as beautiful as the day\nitself, dressed with taste, easy of manner–to let out the secret he\nwas a love-child, the natural son of Lord Dudley and the famous\nMarquise de Vordac–was walking in the great avenue of the Tuileries.\nThis Adonis, by name Henri de Marsay, was born in France, when Lord\nDudley had just married the young lady, already Henri’s mother, to an\nold gentleman called M. de Marsay. This faded and almost extinguished\nbutterfly recognized the child as his own in consideration of the life\ninterest in a fund of a hundred thousand francs definitively assigned\nto his putative son; a generosity which did not cost Lord Dudley too\ndear. French funds were worth at that time seventeen francs, fifty\ncentimes. The old gentleman died without having ever known his wife.\nMadame de Marsay subsequently married the Marquis de Vordac, but\nbefore becoming a marquise she showed very little anxiety as to her\nson and Lord Dudley. To begin with, the declaration of war between\nFrance and England had separated the two lovers, and fidelity at all\ncosts was not, and never will be, the fashion of Paris. Then the\nsuccesses of the woman, elegant, pretty, universally adored, crushed\nin the Parisienne the maternal sentiment. Lord Dudley was no more\ntroubled about his offspring than was the mother,–the speedy\ninfidelity of a young girl he had ardently loved gave him, perhaps, a\nsort of aversion for all that issued from her. Moreover, fathers can,\nperhaps, only love the children with whom they are fully acquainted, a\nsocial belief of the utmost importance for the peace of families,\nwhich should be held by all the celibate, proving as it does that\npaternity is a sentiment nourished artificially by woman, custom, and\nthe law.",
        "Poor Henri de Marsay knew no other father than that one of the two who\nwas not compelled to be one. The paternity of M. de Marsay was\nnaturally most incomplete. In the natural order, it is but for a few\nfleeting instants that children have a father, and M. de Marsay\nimitated nature. The worthy man would not have sold his name had he\nbeen free from vices. Thus he squandered without remorse in gambling\nhells, and drank elsewhere, the few dividends which the National\nTreasury paid to its bondholders. Then he handed over the child to an\naged sister, a Demoiselle de Marsay, who took much care of him, and\nprovided him, out of the meagre sum allowed by her brother, with a\ntutor, an abbe without a farthing, who took the measure of the youth’s\nfuture, and determined to pay himself out of the hundred thousand\nlivres for the care given to his pupil, for whom he conceived an\naffection. As chance had it, this tutor was a true priest, one of\nthose ecclesiastics cut out to become cardinals in France, or Borgias\nbeneath the tiara. He taught the child in three years what he might\nhave learned at college in ten. Then the great man, by name the Abbe\nde Maronis, completed the education of his pupil by making him study\ncivilization under all its aspects: he nourished him on his\nexperience, led him little into churches, which at that time were\nclosed; introduced him sometimes behind the scenes of theatres, more\noften into the houses of courtesans; he exhibited human emotions to\nhim one by one; taught him politics in the drawing-rooms, where they\nsimmered at the time, explained to him the machinery of government,\nand endeavored out of attraction towards a fine nature, deserted, yet\nrich in promise, virilely to replace a mother: is not the Church the\nmother of orphans? The pupil was responsive to so much care. The\nworthy priest died in 1812, a bishop, with the satisfaction of having\nleft in this world a child whose heart and mind were so well moulded\nthat he could outwit a man of forty. Who would have expected to have\nfound a heart of bronze, a brain of steel, beneath external traits as\nseductive as ever the old painters, those naive artists, had given to\nthe serpent in the terrestrial paradise? Nor was that all. In\naddition, the good-natured prelate had procured for the child of his\nchoice certain acquaintances in the best Parisian society, which might\nequal in value, in the young man’s hand, another hundred thousand\ninvested livres. In fine, this priest, vicious but politic, sceptical\nyet learned, treacherous yet amiable, weak in appearance yet as\nvigorous physically as intellectually, was so genuinely useful to his\npupil, so complacent to his vices, so fine a calculator of all kinds\nof strength, so profound when it was needful to make some human\nreckoning, so youthful at table, at Frascati, at–I know not where,\nthat the grateful Henri de Marsay was hardly moved at aught in 1814,\nexcept when he looked at the portrait of his beloved bishop, the only\npersonal possession which the prelate had been able to bequeath him\n(admirable type of the men whose genius will preserve the Catholic,\nApostolic, and Roman Church, compromised for the moment by the\nfeebleness of its recruits and the decrepit age of its pontiffs; but\nif the church likes!).",
        "The continental war prevented young De Marsay from knowing his real\nfather. It is doubtful whether he was aware of his name. A deserted\nchild, he was equally ignorant of Madame de Marsay. Naturally, he had\nlittle regret for his putative father. As for Mademoiselle de Marsay,\nhis only mother, he built for her a handsome little monument in Pere\nLachaise when she died. Monseigneur de Maronis had guaranteed to this\nold lady one of the best places in the skies, so that when he saw her\ndie happy, Henri gave her some egotistical tears; he began to weep on\nhis own account. Observing this grief, the abbe dried his pupil’s\ntears, bidding him observe that the good woman took her snuff most\noffensively, and was becoming so ugly and deaf and tedious that he\nought to return thanks for her death. The bishop had emancipated his\npupil in 1811. Then, when the mother of M. de Marsay remarried, the\npriest chose, in a family council, one of those honest dullards,\npicked out by him through the windows of his confessional, and charged\nhim with the administration of the fortune, the revenues of which he\nwas willing to apply to the needs of the community, but of which he\nwished to preserve the capital.",
        "Towards the end of 1814, then, Henri de Marsay had no sentiment of\nobligation in the world, and was as free as an unmated bird. Although\nhe had lived twenty-two years he appeared to be barely seventeen. As a\nrule the most fastidious of his rivals considered him to be the\nprettiest youth in Paris. From his father, Lord Dudley, he had derived\na pair of the most amorously deceiving blue eyes; from his mother the\nbushiest of black hair, from both pure blood, the skin of a young\ngirl, a gentle and modest expression, a refined and aristocratic\nfigure, and beautiful hands. For a woman, to see him was to lose her\nhead for him; do you understand? to conceive one of those desires\nwhich eat the heart, which are forgotten because of the impossibility\nof satisfying them, because women in Paris are commonly without\ntenacity. Few of them say to themselves, after the fashion of men, the\n“_Je Maintiendrai,” of the House of Orange.",
        "Underneath this fresh young life, and in spite of the limpid springs\nin his eyes, Henri had a lion’s courage, a monkey’s agility. He could\ncut a ball in half at ten paces on the blade of a knife; he rode his\nhorse in a way that made you realize the fable of the Centaur; drove a\nfour-in-hand with grace; was as light as a cherub and quiet as a lamb,\nbut knew how to beat a townsman at the terrible game of savate or\ncudgels; moreover, he played the piano in a fashion which would have\nenabled him to become an artist should he fall on calamity, and owned\na voice which would have been worth to Barbaja fifty thousand francs a\nseason. Alas, that all these fine qualities, these pretty faults, were\ntarnished by one abominable vice: he believed neither in man nor\nwoman, God nor Devil. Capricious nature had commenced by endowing him,\na priest had completed the work.",
        "To render this adventure comprehensible, it is necessary to add here\nthat Lord Dudley naturally found many women disposed to reproduce\nsamples of such a delicious pattern. His second masterpiece of this\nkind was a young girl named Euphemie, born of a Spanish lady, reared\nin Havana, and brought to Madrid with a young Creole woman of the\nAntilles, and with all the ruinous tastes of the Colonies, but\nfortunately married to an old and extremely rich Spanish noble, Don\nHijos, Marquis de San-Real, who, since the occupation of Spain by\nFrench troops, had taken up his abode in Paris, and lived in the Rue\nSt. Lazare. As much from indifference as from any respect for the\ninnocence of youth, Lord Dudley was not in the habit of keeping his\nchildren informed of the relations he created for them in all parts.\nThat is a slightly inconvenient form of civilization; it has so many\nadvantages that we must overlook its drawbacks in consideration of its\nbenefits. Lord Dudley, to make no more words of it, came to Paris in\n1816 to take refuge from the pursuit of English justice, which\nprotects nothing Oriental except commerce. The exiled lord, when he\nsaw Henri, asked who that handsome young man might be. Then, upon\nhearing the name, “Ah, it is my son. . . . What a pity!” he said.",
        "Such was the story of the young man who, about the middle of the month\nof April, 1815, was walking indolently up the broad avenue of the\nTuileries, after the fashion of all those animals who, knowing their\nstrength, pass along in majesty and peace. Middle-class matrons turned\nback naively to look at him again; other women, without turning round,\nwaited for him to pass again, and engraved him in their minds that\nthey might remember in due season that fragrant face, which would not\nhave disadorned the body of the fairest among themselves.",
        "“What are you doing here on Sunday?” said the Marquis de Ronquerolles\nto Henri, as he passed.",
        "“There’s a fish in the net,” answered the young man.",
        "This exchange of thoughts was accomplished by means of two significant\nglances, without it appearing that either De Ronquerolles or De Marsay\nhad any knowledge of the other. The young man was taking note of the\npassers-by with that promptitude of eye and ear which is peculiar to\nthe Parisian who seems, at first, to see and hear nothing, but who\nsees and hears all.",
        "At that moment a young man came up to him and took him familiarly by\nthe arm, saying to him: “How are you, my dear De Marsay?”",
        "“Extremely well,” De Marsay answered, with that air of apparent\naffection which amongst the young men of Paris proves nothing, either\nfor the present or the future.",
        "In effect, the youth of Paris resemble the youth of no other town.\nThey may be divided into two classes: the young man who has something,\nand the young man who has nothing; or the young man who thinks and he\nwho spends. But, be it well understood this applies only to those\nnatives of the soil who maintain in Paris the delicious course of the\nelegant life. There exist, as well, plenty of other young men, but\nthey are children who are late in conceiving Parisian life, and who\nremain its dupes. They do not speculate, they study; they fag, as\nthe others say. Finally there are to be found, besides, certain young\npeople, rich or poor, who embrace careers and follow them with a\nsingle heart; they are somewhat like the Emile of Rousseau, of the\nflesh of citizens, and they never appear in society. The diplomatic\nimpolitely dub them fools. Be they that or no, they augment the number\nof those mediocrities beneath the yoke of which France is bowed down.\nThey are always there, always ready to bungle public or private\nconcerns with the dull trowel of their mediocrity, bragging of their\nimpotence, which they count for conduct and integrity. This sort of\nsocial prizemen infests the administration, the army, the\nmagistracy, the chambers, the courts. They diminish and level down the\ncountry and constitute, in some manner, in the body politic, a lymph\nwhich infects it and renders it flabby. These honest folk call men of\ntalent immoral or rogues. If such rogues require to be paid for their\nservices, at least their services are there; whereas the other sort do\nharm and are respected by the mob; but, happily for France, elegant\nyouth stigmatizes them ceaselessly under the name of louts.",
        "At the first glance, then, it is natural to consider as very distinct\nthe two sorts of young men who lead the life of elegance, the amiable\ncorporation to which Henri de Marsay belonged. But the observer, who\ngoes beyond the superficial aspect of things, is soon convinced that\nthe difference is purely moral, and that nothing is so deceptive as\nthis pretty outside. Nevertheless, all alike take precedence over\neverybody else; speak rightly or wrongly of things, of men,\nliterature, and the fine arts; have ever in their mouth the Pitt and\nCoburg of each year; interrupt a conversation with a pun, turn into\nridicule science and the savant; despise all things which they do\nnot know or which they fear; set themselves above all by constituting\nthemselves the supreme judges of all. They would all hoax their\nfathers, and be ready to shed crocodile tears upon their mothers’\nbreasts; but generally they believe in nothing, blaspheme women, or\nplay at modesty, and in reality are led by some old woman or an evil\ncourtesan. They are all equally eaten to the bone with calculation,\nwith depravity, with a brutal lust to succeed, and if you plumbed for\ntheir hearts you would find in all a stone. In their normal state they\nhave the prettiest exterior, stake their friendship at every turn, are\ncaptivating alike. The same badinage dominates their ever-changing\njargon; they seek for oddity in their toilette, glory in repeating the\nstupidities of such and such actor who is in fashion, and commence\noperations, it matters not with whom, with contempt and impertinence,\nin order to have, as it were, the first move in the game; but, woe\nbetide him who does not know how to take a blow on one cheek for the\nsake of rendering two. They resemble, in fine, that pretty white spray\nwhich crests the stormy waves. They dress and dance, dine and take\ntheir pleasure, on the day of Waterloo, in the time of cholera or\nrevolution. Finally, their expenses are all the same, but here the\ncontrast comes in. Of this fluctuating fortune, so agreeably flung\naway, some possess the capital for which the others wait; they have\nthe same tailors, but the bills of the latter are still to pay. Next,\nif the first, like sieves, take in ideas of all kinds without\nretaining any, the latter compare them and assimilate all the good. If\nthe first believe they know something, know nothing and understand\neverything, lend all to those who need nothing and offer nothing to\nthose who are in need; the latter study secretly others’ thoughts and\nplace out their money, like their follies, at big interest. The one\nclass have no more faithful impressions, because their soul, like a\nmirror, worn from use, no longer reflects any image; the others\neconomize their senses and life, even while they seem, like the first,\nto be flinging them away broadcast. The first, on the faith of a hope,\ndevote themselves without conviction to a system which has wind and\ntide against it, but they leap upon another political craft when the\nfirst goes adrift; the second take the measure of the future, sound\nit, and see in political fidelity what the English see in commercial\nintegrity, an element of success. Where the young man of possessions\nmakes a pun or an epigram upon the restoration of the throne, he who\nhas nothing makes a public calculation or a secret reservation, and\nobtains everything by giving a handshake to his friends. The one deny\nevery faculty to others, look upon all their ideas as new, as though\nthe world had been made yesterday, they have unlimited confidence in\nthemselves, and no crueler enemy than those same selves. But the\nothers are armed with an incessant distrust of men, whom they estimate\nat their value, and are sufficiently profound to have one thought\nbeyond their friends, whom they exploit; then of evenings, when they\nlay their heads on their pillows, they weigh men as a miser weighs his\ngold pieces. The one are vexed at an aimless impertinence, and allow\nthemselves to be ridiculed by the diplomatic, who make them dance for\nthem by pulling what is the main string of these puppets–their\nvanity. Thus, a day comes when those who had nothing have something,\nand those who had something have nothing. The latter look at their\ncomrades who have achieved positions as cunning fellows; their hearts\nmay be bad, but their heads are strong. “He is very strong!” is the\nsupreme praise accorded to those who have attained quibuscumque\nviis, political rank, a woman, or a fortune. Amongst them are to be\nfound certain young men who play this role by commencing with having\ndebts. Naturally, these are more dangerous than those who play it\nwithout a farthing.",
        "The young man who called himself a friend of Henri de Marsay was a\nrattle-head who had come from the provinces, and whom the young men\nthen in fashion were teaching the art of running through an\ninheritance; but he had one last leg to stand on in his province, in\nthe shape of a secure establishment. He was simply an heir who had\npassed without any transition from his pittance of a hundred francs a\nmonth to the entire paternal fortune, and who, if he had not wit\nenough to perceive that he was laughed at, was sufficiently cautious\nto stop short at two-thirds of his capital. He had learned at Paris,\nfor a consideration of some thousands of francs, the exact value of\nharness, the art of not being too respectful to his gloves, learned to\nmake skilful meditations upon the right wages to give people, and to\nseek out what bargain was the best to close with them. He set store on\nhis capacity to speak in good terms of his horses, of his Pyrenean\nhound; to tell by her dress, her walk, her shoes, to what class a\nwoman belonged; to study ecarte, remember a few fashionable\ncatchwords, and win by his sojourn in Parisian society the necessary\nauthority to import later into his province a taste for tea and silver\nof an English fashion, and to obtain the right of despising everything\naround him for the rest of his days.",
        "De Marsay had admitted him to his society in order to make use of him\nin the world, just as a bold speculator employs a confidential clerk.\nThe friendship, real or feigned, of De Marsay was a social position\nfor Paul de Manerville, who, on his side, thought himself astute in\nexploiting, after his fashion, his intimate friend. He lived in the\nreflecting lustre of his friend, walked constantly under his umbrella,\nwore his boots, gilded himself with his rays. When he posed in Henri’s\ncompany or walked at his side, he had the air of saying: “Don’t insult\nus, we are real dogs.” He often permitted himself to remark fatuously:\n“If I were to ask Henri for such and such a thing, he is a good enough\nfriend of mine to do it.” But he was careful never to ask anything of\nhim. He feared him, and his fear, although imperceptible, reacted upon\nthe others, and was of use to De Marsay.",
        "“De Marsay is a man of a thousand,” said Paul. “Ah, you will see, he\nwill be what he likes. I should not be surprised to find him one of\nthese days Minister of Foreign Affairs. Nothing can withstand him.”",
        "He made of De Marsay what Corporal Trim made of his cap, a perpetual\ninstance.",
        "“Ask De Marsay and you will see!”",
        "Or again:",
        "“The other day we were hunting, De Marsay and I, He would not believe\nme, but I jumped a hedge without moving on my horse!”",
        "Or again:",
        "“We were with some women, De Marsay and I, and upon my word of honor,\nI was––” etc.",
        "Thus Paul de Manerville could not be classed amongst the great,\nillustrious, and powerful family of fools who succeed. He would one\nday be a deputy. For the time he was not even a young man. His friend,\nDe Marsay, defined him thus: “You ask me what is Paul? Paul? Why, Paul\nde Manerville!”",
        "“I am surprised, my dear fellow,” he said to De Marsay, “to see you\nhere on a Sunday.”",
        "“I was going to ask you the same question.”",
        "“Is it an intrigue?”",
        "“An intrigue.”",
        "“Bah!”",
        "“I can mention it to you without compromising my passion. Besides, a\nwoman who comes to the Tuileries on Sundays is of no account,\naristocratically speaking.”",
        "“Ah! ah!”",
        "“Hold your tongue then, or I shall tell you nothing. Your laugh is too\nloud, you will make people think that we have lunched too well. Last\nThursday, here on the Terrasse des Feuillants, I was walking along,\nthinking of nothing at all, but when I got to the gate of the Rue de\nCastiglione, by which I intended to leave, I came face to face with a\nwoman, or rather a young girl; who, if she did not throw herself at my\nhead, stopped short, less I think, from human respect, than from one\nof those movements of profound surprise which affect the limbs, creep\ndown the length of the spine, and cease only in the sole of the feet,\nto nail you to the ground. I have often produced effects of this\nnature, a sort of animal magnetism which becomes enormously powerful\nwhen the relations are reciprocally precise. But, my dear fellow, this\nwas not stupefaction, nor was she a common girl. Morally speaking, her\nface seemed to say: ’What, is it you, my ideal! The creation of my\nthoughts, of my morning and evening dreams! What, are you there? Why\nthis morning? Why not yesterday? Take me, I am thine, et cetera!’\nGood, I said to myself, another one! Then I scrutinize her. Ah, my\ndear fellow, speaking physically, my incognita is the most adorable\nfeminine person whom I ever met. She belongs to that feminine variety\nwhich the Romans call fulva, flava–the woman of fire. And in chief,\nwhat struck me the most, what I am still taken with, are her two\nyellow eyes, like a tiger’s, a golden yellow that gleams, living gold,\ngold which thinks, gold which loves, and is determined to take refuge\nin your pocket.”",
        "“My dear fellow, we are full of her!” cried Paul. “She comes here\nsometimes–the girl with the golden eyes! That is the name we have\ngiven her. She is a young creature–not more than twenty-two, and I\nhave seen her here in the time of the Bourbons, but with a woman who\nwas worth a hundred thousand of her.”",
        "“Silence, Paul! It is impossible for any woman to surpass this girl;\nshe is like the cat who rubs herself against your legs; a white girl\nwith ash-colored hair, delicate in appearance, but who must have downy\nthreads on the third phalanx of her fingers, and all along her cheeks\na white down whose line, luminous on fine days, begins at her ears and\nloses itself on her neck.”",
        "“Ah, the other, my dear De Marsay! She has black eyes which have never\nwept, but which burn; black eyebrows which meet and give her an air of\nhardness contradicted by the compact curve of her lips, on which the\nkisses do not stay, lips burning and fresh; a Moorish color that warms\na man like the sun. But–upon my word of honor, she is like you!”",
        "“You flatter her!”",
        "“A firm figure, the tapering figure of a corvette built for speed,\nwhich rushes down upon the merchant vessel with French impetuosity,\nwhich grapples with her and sinks her at the same time.”",
        "“After all, my dear fellow,” answered De Marsay, “what has that got to\ndo with me, since I have never seen her? Ever since I have studied\nwomen, my incognita is the only one whose virginal bosom, whose ardent\nand voluptuous forms, have realized for me the only woman of my dreams\n–of my dreams! She is the original of that ravishing picture called\nLa Femme Caressant sa Chimere, the warmest, the most infernal\ninspiration of the genius of antiquity; a holy poem prostituted by\nthose who have copied it for frescoes and mosiacs; for a heap of\nbourgeois who see in this gem nothing more than a gew-gaw and hang it\non their watch-chains–whereas, it is the whole woman, an abyss of\npleasure into which one plunges and finds no end; whereas, it is the\nideal woman, to be seen sometimes in reality in Spain or Italy, almost\nnever in France. Well, I have again seen this girl of the gold eyes,\nthis woman caressing her chimera. I saw her on Friday. I had a\npresentiment that on the following day she would be here at the same\nhour; I was not mistaken. I have taken a pleasure in following her\nwithout being observed, in studying her indolent walk, the walk of the\nwoman without occupation, but in the movements of which one devines\nall the pleasure that lies asleep. Well, she turned back again, she\nsaw me, once more she adored me, once more trembled, shivered. It was\nthen I noticed the genuine Spanish duenna who looked after her, a\nhyena upon whom some jealous man has put a dress, a she-devil well\npaid, no doubt, to guard this delicious creature. . . . Ah, then the\nduenna made me deeper in love. I grew curious. On Saturday, nobody.\nAnd here I am to-day waiting for this girl whose chimera I am, asking\nnothing better than to pose as the monster in the fresco.”",
        "“There she is,” said Paul. “Every one is turning round to look at\nher.”",
        "The unknown blushed, her eyes shone; she saw Henri, she shut them and\npassed by.",
        "“You say that she notices you?” cried Paul, facetiously.",
        "The duenna looked fixedly and attentively at the two young men. When\nthe unknown and Henri passed each other again, the young girl touched\nhim, and with her hand pressed the hand of the young man. Then she\nturned her head and smiled with passion, but the duenna led her away\nvery quickly to the gate of the Rue de Castiglione.",
        "The two friends followed the young girl, admiring the magnificent\ngrace of the neck which met her head in a harmony of vigorous lines,\nand upon which a few coils of hair were tightly wound. The girl with\nthe golden eyes had that well-knitted, arched, slender foot which\npresents so many attractions to the dainty imagination. Moreover, she\nwas shod with elegance, and wore a short skirt. During her course she\nturned from time to time to look at Henri, and appeared to follow the\nold woman regretfully, seeming to be at once her mistress and her\nslave; she could break her with blows, but could not dismiss her. All\nthat was perceptible. The two friends reached the gate. Two men in\nlivery let down the step of a tasteful coupe emblazoned with\narmorial bearings. The girl with the golden eyes was the first to\nenter it, took her seat at the side where she could be best seen when\nthe carriage turned, put her hand on the door, and waved her\nhandkerchief in the duennna’s despite. In contempt of what might be\nsaid by the curious, her handkerchief cried to Henri openly: “Follow\nme!”",
        "“Have you ever seen a handkerchief better thrown?” said Henri to Paul\nde Manerville.",
        "Then, observing a fiacre on the point of departure, having just set\ndown a fare, he made a sign to the driver to wait.",
        "“Follow that carriage, notice the house and the street where it stops\n–you shall have ten francs. . . . Paul, adieu.”",
        "The cab followed the coupe. The coupe stopped in the Rue Saint\nLazare before one of the finest houses of the neighborhood.",
