        "65A. We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not\nPERMITTED to sin.",
        "66. The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded,\nrobbed, deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God\namong men.",
        "67. Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the\nexpense of all others. Love to God also!",
        "68. “I did that,” says my memory. “I could not have done that,\"\nsays my pride, and remains inexorable. Eventually—the memory\nyields.",
        "69. One has regarded life carelessly, if one has failed to see\nthe hand that—kills with leniency.",
        "70. If a man has character, he has also his typical experience,\nwhich always recurs.",
        "71. THE SAGE AS ASTRONOMER.—So long as thou feelest the stars as\nan “above thee,” thou lackest the eye of the discerning one.",
        "72. It is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments\nthat makes great men.",
        "73. He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it.",
        "73A. Many a peacock hides his tail from every eye—and calls it\nhis pride.",
        "74. A man of genius is unbearable, unless he possess at least two\nthings besides: gratitude and purity.",
        "75. The degree and nature of a man’s sensuality extends to the\nhighest altitudes of his spirit.",
        "76. Under peaceful conditions the militant man attacks himself.",
        "77. With his principles a man seeks either to dominate, or\njustify, or honour, or reproach, or conceal his habits: two men\nwith the same principles probably seek fundamentally different\nends therewith.",
        "78. He who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself\nthereby, as a despiser.",
        "79. A soul which knows that it is loved, but does not itself\nlove, betrays its sediment: its dregs come up.",
        "80. A thing that is explained ceases to concern us—What did the\nGod mean who gave the advice, “Know thyself!” Did it perhaps\nimply “Cease to be concerned about thyself! become objective!\"—\nAnd Socrates?—And the “scientific man”?",
        "81. It is terrible to die of thirst at sea. Is it necessary that\nyou should so salt your truth that it will no longer—quench\nthirst?",
        "82. “Sympathy for all\"—would be harshness and tyranny for THEE,\nmy good neighbour.",
        "83. INSTINCT—When the house is on fire one forgets even the\ndinner—Yes, but one recovers it from among the ashes.",
        "84. Woman learns how to hate in proportion as she—forgets how to\ncharm.",
        "85. The same emotions are in man and woman, but in different\nTEMPO, on that account man and woman never cease to misunderstand\neach other.",
        "86. In the background of all their personal vanity, women\nthemselves have still their impersonal scorn—for “woman”.",
        "87. FETTERED HEART, FREE SPIRIT—When one firmly fetters one’s\nheart and keeps it prisoner, one can allow one’s spirit many\nliberties: I said this once before But people do not believe it\nwhen I say so, unless they know it already.",
        "88. One begins to distrust very clever persons when they become\nembarrassed.",
        "89. Dreadful experiences raise the question whether he who\nexperiences them is not something dreadful also.",
        "90. Heavy, melancholy men turn lighter, and come temporarily to\ntheir surface, precisely by that which makes others heavy—by\nhatred and love.",
        "91. So cold, so icy, that one burns one’s finger at the touch of\nhim! Every hand that lays hold of him shrinks back!—And for that\nvery reason many think him red-hot.",
        "92. Who has not, at one time or another—sacrificed himself for\nthe sake of his good name?",
        "93. In affability there is no hatred of men, but precisely on\nthat account a great deal too much contempt of men.",
        "94. The maturity of man—that means, to have reacquired the\nseriousness that one had as a child at play.",
        "95. To be ashamed of one’s immorality is a step on the ladder at\nthe end of which one is ashamed also of one’s morality.",
        "96. One should part from life as Ulysses parted from Nausicaa—\nblessing it rather than in love with it.",

        "98. When one trains one’s conscience, it kisses one while it\nbites.",
        "99. THE DISAPPOINTED ONE SPEAKS—\"I listened for the echo and I\nheard only praise”.",
        "100. We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are,\nwe thus relax ourselves away from our fellows.",
        "101. A discerning one might easily regard himself at present as\nthe animalization of God.",
        "102. Discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the\nlover with regard to the beloved. “What! She is modest enough to\nlove even you? Or stupid enough? Or—or—-”",
        "103. THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS.—\"Everything now turns out best for\nme, I now love every fate:—who would like to be my fate?”",
        "104. Not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love,\nprevents the Christians of today—burning us.",
        "105. The pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste (the\n“piety”) of the free spirit (the “pious man of knowledge”) than\nthe impia fraus. Hence the profound lack of judgment, in\ncomparison with the Church, characteristic of the type “free\nspirit\"—as ITS non-freedom.",
        "106. By means of music the very passions enjoy themselves.",
        "107. A sign of strong character, when once the resolution has\nbeen taken, to shut the ear even to the best counter-arguments.\nOccasionally, therefore, a will to stupidity.",
        "108. There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral\ninterpretation of phenomena.",
        "109. The criminal is often enough not equal to his deed: he\nextenuates and maligns it.",
        "110. The advocates of a criminal are seldom artists enough to\nturn the beautiful terribleness of the deed to the advantage of\nthe doer.",
        "111. Our vanity is most difficult to wound just when our pride\nhas been wounded.",
        "112. To him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and\nnot to belief, all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he\nguards against them.",
        "113. “You want to prepossess him in your favour? Then you must be\nembarrassed before him.”",
        "114. The immense expectation with regard to sexual love, and the\ncoyness in this expectation, spoils all the perspectives of women\nat the outset.",
        "115. Where there is neither love nor hatred in the game, woman’s\nplay is mediocre.",
        "116. The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain\ncourage to rebaptize our badness as the best in us.",
        "117. The will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will\nof another, or of several other, emotions.",
        "118. There is an innocence of admiration: it is possessed by him\nto whom it has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired\nsome day.",
        "119. Our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our\ncleaning ourselves—\"justifying” ourselves.",
        "120. Sensuality often forces the growth of love too much, so that\nits root remains weak, and is easily torn up.",
        "121. It is a curious thing that God learned Greek when he wished\nto turn author—and that he did not learn it better.",
        "122. To rejoice on account of praise is in many cases merely\npoliteness of heart—and the very opposite of vanity of spirit.",
        "123. Even concubinage has been corrupted—by marriage.",
        "124. He who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but\nbecause of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected\nit. A parable.",
        "125. When we have to change an opinion about any one, we charge\nheavily to his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us.",
        "126. A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at six or seven\ngreat men.—Yes, and then to get round them.",
        "127. In the eyes of all true women science is hostile to the\nsense of shame. They feel as if one wished to peep under their\nskin with it—or worse still! under their dress and finery.",
        "128. The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must\nyou allure the senses to it.",
        "129. The devil has the most extensive perspectives for God; on\nthat account he keeps so far away from him:—the devil, in\neffect, as the oldest friend of knowledge.",
        "130. What a person IS begins to betray itself when his talent\ndecreases,—when he ceases to show what he CAN do. Talent is also\nan adornment; an adornment is also a concealment.",
        "131. The sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is\nthat in reality they honour and love only themselves (or their\nown ideal, to express it more agreeably). Thus man wishes woman\nto be peaceable: but in fact woman is ESSENTIALLY unpeaceable,\nlike the cat, however well she may have assumed the peaceable\ndemeanour.",
        "132. One is punished best for one’s virtues.",
        "133. He who cannot find the way to HIS ideal, lives more\nfrivolously and shamelessly than the man without an ideal.",
        "134. From the senses originate all trustworthiness, all good\nconscience, all evidence of truth.",
        "135. Pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man; a\nconsiderable part of it is rather an essential condition of being\ngood.",
        "136. The one seeks an accoucheur for his thoughts, the other\nseeks some one whom he can assist: a good conversation thus\noriginates.",
        "137. In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes\nmistakes of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not\ninfrequently finds a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre\nartist, one finds a very remarkable man.",
        "138. We do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent\nand imagine him with whom we have intercourse—and forget it\nimmediately.",
        "139. In revenge and in love woman is more barbarous than man.",
        "140. ADVICE AS A RIDDLE.—\"If the band is not to break, bite it\nfirst—secure to make!”",
        "141. The belly is the reason why man does not so readily take\nhimself for a God.",
        "142. The chastest utterance I ever heard: “Dans le veritable\namour c’est I l’ame qui enveloppe le corps.”",
        "143. Our vanity would like what we do best to pass precisely for\nwhat is most difficult to us.—Concerning the origin of many\nsystems of morals.",
        "144. When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is generally\nsomething wrong with her sexual nature. Barrenness itself\nconduces to a certain virility of taste; man, indeed, if I may\nsay so, is “the barren animal.”",
        "145. Comparing man and woman generally, one may say that woman\nwould not have the genius for adornment, if she had not the\ninstinct for the SECONDARY role.",
        "146. He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he\nthereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss,\nthe abyss will also gaze into thee.",
        "147. From old Florentine novels—moreover, from life: Buona\nfemmina e mala femmina vuol bastone.—Sacchetti, Nov. 86.",
        "148. To seduce their neighbour to a favourable opinion, and\nafterwards to believe implicitly in this opinion of their\nneighbour—who can do this conjuring trick so well as women?",
        "149. That which an age considers evil is usually an unseasonable\necho of what was formerly considered good—the atavism of an old\nideal.",
        "150. Around the hero everything becomes a tragedy; around the\ndemigod everything becomes a satyr-play; and around God\neverything becomes—what? perhaps a “world”?",
        "151. It is not enough to possess a talent: one must also have\nyour permission to possess it;—eh, my friends?",
        "152. “Where there is the tree of knowledge, there is always\nParadise”: so say the most ancient and the most modern serpents.",
        "153. What is done out of love always takes place beyond good and\nevil.",
        "154. Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are\nsigns of health; everything absolute belongs to pathology.",
        "155. The sense of the tragic increases and declines with\nsensuousness.",
        "156. Insanity in individuals is something rare—but in groups,\nparties, nations, and epochs it is the rule.",
        "157. The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of\nit one gets successfully through many a bad night.",
        "158. Not only our reason, but also our conscience, truckles to\nour strongest impulse—the tyrant in us.",
        "159. One MUST repay good and ill; but why just to the person who\ndid us good or ill?",
        "160. One no longer loves one’s knowledge sufficiently after one\nhas communicated it.",
        "161. Poets act shamelessly towards their experiences: they\nexploit them.",
        "162. “Our fellow-creature is not our neighbour, but our\nneighbour’s neighbour”:—so thinks every nation.",
        "163. Love brings to light the noble and hidden qualities of a\nlover—his rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be\ndeceptive as to his normal character.",
        "164. Jesus said to his Jews: “The law was for servants;—love God\nas I love him, as his Son! What have we Sons of God to do with\nmorals!”",
        "165. IN SIGHT OF EVERY PARTY.—A shepherd has always need of a\nbell-wether—or he has himself to be a wether occasionally.",
        "166. One may indeed lie with the mouth; but with the accompanying\ngrimace one nevertheless tells the truth.",
        "167. To vigorous men intimacy is a matter of shame—and something\nprecious.",
        "168. Christianity gave Eros poison to drink; he did not die of\nit, certainly, but degenerated to Vice.",

        "170. In praise there is more obtrusiveness than in blame.",
        "171. Pity has an almost ludicrous effect on a man of knowledge,\nlike tender hands on a Cyclops.",
        "172. One occasionally embraces some one or other, out of love to\nmankind (because one cannot embrace all); but this is what one\nmust never confess to the individual.",
        "173. One does not hate as long as one disesteems, but only when\none esteems equal or superior.",
        "174. Ye Utilitarians—ye, too, love the UTILE only as a VEHICLE\nfor your inclinations,—ye, too, really find the noise of its\nwheels insupportable!",
        "175. One loves ultimately one’s desires, not the thing desired.",
        "176. The vanity of others is only counter to our taste when it is\ncounter to our vanity.",
        "177. With regard to what “truthfulness” is, perhaps nobody has\never been sufficiently truthful.",
        "178. One does not believe in the follies of clever men: what a\nforfeiture of the rights of man!",
        "179. The consequences of our actions seize us by the forelock,\nvery indifferent to the fact that we have meanwhile “reformed.”",
