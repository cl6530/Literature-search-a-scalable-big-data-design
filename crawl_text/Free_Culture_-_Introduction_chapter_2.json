        "On December 17,1903, on a windy North Carolina beach for just shy of one hundred \nseconds, the Wright brothers demonstrated that a heavier-than-air, self-\npropelled vehicle could fly. The moment was electric and its importance widely \nunderstood. Almost immediately, there was an explosion of interest in this \nnewfound technology of manned flight, and a gaggle of innovators began to build \nupon it.",
        "At the time the Wright brothers invented the airplane, American law held that a \nproperty owner presumptively owned not just the surface of his land, but all the \nland below, down to the center of the earth, and all the space above, to an \nindefinite extent, upwards. [1] For many years, scholars had puzzled about how \nbest to interpret the idea that rights in land ran to the heavens. Did that mean \nthat you owned the stars? Could you prosecute geese for their willful and \nregular trespass?",
        "Then came airplanes, and for the first time, this principle of American lawdeep \nwithin the foundations of our tradition, and acknowledged by the most important \nlegal thinkers of our pastmattered. If my land reaches to the heavens, what \nhappens when United flies over my field? Do I have the right to banish it from \nmy property? Am I allowed to enter into an exclusive license with Delta \nAirlines? Could we set up an auction to decide how much these rights are worth?",
        "In 1945, these questions became a federal case. When North Carolina farmers \nThomas Lee and Tinie Causby started losing chickens because of low-flying \nmilitary aircraft (the terrified chickens apparently flew into the barn walls \nand died), the Causbys filed a lawsuit saying that the government was \ntrespassing on their land. The airplanes, of course, never touched the surface \nof the Causbys’ land. But if, as Blackstone, Kent, and Coke had said, their land \nreached to an indefinite extent, upwards, then the government was trespassing \non their property, and the Causbys wanted it to stop.",
        "The Supreme Court agreed to hear the Causbys’ case. Congress had declared the \nairways public, but if one’s property really extended to the heavens, then \nCongress’s declaration could well have been an unconstitutional taking of \nproperty without compensation. The Court acknowledged that it is ancient \ndoctrine that common law ownership of the land extended to the periphery of the \nuniverse. But Justice Douglas had no patience for ancient doctrine. In a single \nparagraph, hundreds of years of property law were erased. As he wrote for the \nCourt,",
        "[The] doctrine has no place in the modern world. The air is a public highway, \nas Congress has declared. Were that not true, every transcontinental flight \nwould subject the operator to countless trespass suits. Common sense revolts at \nthe idea. To recognize such private claims to the airspace would clog these \nhighways, seriously interfere with their control and development in the public \ninterest, and transfer into private ownership that to which only the public has \na just claim. [2]",
        "Common sense revolts at the idea.",
        "This is how the law usually works. Not often this abruptly or impatiently, but \neventually, this is how it works. It was Douglas’s style not to dither. Other \njustices would have blathered on for pages to reach the conclusion that Douglas \nholds in a single line: Common sense revolts at the idea. But whether it takes \npages or a few words, it is the special genius of a common law system, as ours \nis, that the law adjusts to the technologies of the time. And as it adjusts, it \nchanges. Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age crumble in another.",
        "Or at least, this is how things happen when there’s no one powerful on the other \nside of the change. The Causbys were just farmers. And though there were no \ndoubt many like them who were upset by the growing traffic in the air (though \none hopes not many chickens flew themselves into walls), the Causbys of the \nworld would find it very hard to unite and stop the idea, and the technology, \nthat the Wright brothers had birthed. The Wright brothers spat airplanes into \nthe technological meme pool; the idea then spread like a virus in a chicken \ncoop; farmers like the Causbys found themselves surrounded by what seemed \nreasonable given the technology that the Wrights had produced. They could stand \non their farms, dead chickens in hand, and shake their fists at these newfangled \ntechnologies all they wanted. They could call their representatives or even file \na lawsuit. But in the end, the force of what seems obvious to everyone else\nthe power of common sensewould prevail. Their private interest would not be \nallowed to defeat an obvious public gain.",
        "Edwin Howard Armstrong is one of America’s forgotten inventor geniuses. He came \nto the great American inventor scene just after the titans Thomas Edison and \nAlexander Graham Bell. But his work in the area of radio technology was perhaps \nthe most important of any single inventor in the first fifty years of radio. He \nwas better educated than Michael Faraday, who as a bookbinder’s apprentice had \ndiscovered electric induction in 1831. But he had the same intuition about how \nthe world of radio worked, and on at least three occasions, Armstrong invented \nprofoundly important technologies that advanced our understanding of radio.",
        "On the day after Christmas, 1933, four patents were issued to Armstrong for his \nmost significant inventionFM radio. Until then, consumer radio had been \namplitude-modulated (AM) radio. The theorists of the day had said that \nfrequency-modulated (FM) radio could never work. They were right about FM radio \nin a narrow band of spectrum. But Armstrong discovered that frequency-modulated \nradio in a wide band of spectrum would deliver an astonishing fidelity of sound, \nwith much less transmitter power and static.",
        "On November 5, 1935, he demonstrated the technology at a meeting of the \nInstitute of Radio Engineers at the Empire State Building in New York City. He \ntuned his radio dial across a range of AM stations, until the radio locked on a \nbroadcast that he had arranged from seventeen miles away. The radio fell totally \nsilent, as if dead, and then with a clarity no one else in that room had ever \nheard from an electrical device, it produced the sound of an announcer’s voice: \nThis is amateur station W2AG at Yonkers, New York, operating on frequency \nmodulation at two and a half meters.",
        "The audience was hearing something no one had thought possible:",
        "A glass of water was poured before the microphone in Yonkers; it sounded like a \nglass of water being poured. ... A paper was crumpled and torn; it sounded like \npaper and not like a crackling forest fire. ... Sousa marches were played from \nrecords and a piano solo and guitar number were performed. ... The music was \nprojected with a live-ness rarely if ever heard before from a radio music box. \n [3] ",
        "As our own common sense tells us, Armstrong had discovered a vastly superior \nradio technology. But at the time of his invention, Armstrong was working for \nRCA. RCA was the dominant player in the then dominant AM radio market. By 1935, \nthere were a thousand radio stations across the United States, but the stations \nin large cities were all owned by a handful of networks.",
        "RCA’s president, David Sarnoff, a friend of Armstrong’s, was eager that \nArmstrong discover a way to remove static from AM radio. So Sarnoff was quite \nexcited when Armstrong told him he had a device that removed static from \nradio. But when Armstrong demonstrated his invention, Sarnoff was not pleased.",
        "I thought Armstrong would invent some kind of a filter to remove static from \nour AM radio. I didn’t think he’d start a revolutionstart up a whole damn new \nindustry to compete with RCA. [4]",
        "Armstrong’s invention threatened RCA’s AM empire, so the company launched a \ncampaign to smother FM radio. While FM may have been a superior technology, \nSarnoff was a superior tactician. As one author described,",
        "The forces for FM, largely engineering, could not overcome the weight of \nstrategy devised by the sales, patent, and legal offices to subdue this threat \nto corporate position. For FM, if allowed to develop unrestrained, posed ... a \ncomplete reordering of radio power ... and the eventual overthrow of the \ncarefully restricted AM system on which RCA had grown to power. [5]",
        "RCA at first kept the technology in house, insisting that further tests were \nneeded. When, after two years of testing, Armstrong grew impatient, RCA began to \nuse its power with the government to stall FM radio’s deployment generally. In \n1936, RCA hired the former head of the FCC and assigned him the task of assuring \nthat the FCC assign spectrum in a way that would castrate FMprincipally by \nmoving FM radio to a different band of spectrum. At first, these efforts failed. \nBut when Armstrong and the nation were distracted by World War II, RCA’s work \nbegan to be more successful. Soon after the war ended, the FCC announced a set \nof policies that would have one clear effect: FM radio would be crippled. As \nLawrence Lessing described it,",
        "The series of body blows that FM radio received right after the war, in a \nseries of rulings manipulated through the FCC by the big radio interests, were \nalmost incredible in their force and deviousness. [6]",
        "To make room in the spectrum for RCA’s latest gamble, television, FM radio users \nwere to be moved to a totally new spectrum band. The power of FM radio stations \nwas also cut, meaning FM could no longer be used to beam programs from one part \nof the country to another. (This change was strongly supported by AT&T, because \nthe loss of FM relaying stations would mean radio stations would have to buy \nwired links from AT&T.) The spread of FM radio was thus choked, at least \ntemporarily. ",
        "Armstrong resisted RCA’s efforts. In response, RCA resisted Armstrong’s patents. \nAfter incorporating FM technology into the emerging standard for television, RCA \ndeclared the patents invalidbaselessly, and almost fifteen years after they \nwere issued. It thus refused to pay him royalties. For six years, Armstrong \nfought an expensive war of litigation to defend the patents. Finally, just as \nthe patents expired, RCA offered a settlement so low that it would not even \ncover Armstrong’s lawyers’ fees. Defeated, broken, and now broke, in 1954 \nArmstrong wrote a short note to his wife and then stepped out of a thirteenth-\nstory window to his death.",
        "This is how the law sometimes works. Not often this tragically, and rarely with \nheroic drama, but sometimes, this is how it works. From the beginning, \ngovernment and government agencies have been subject to capture. They are more \nlikely captured when a powerful interest is threatened by either a legal or \ntechnical change. That powerful interest too often exerts its influence within \nthe government to get the government to protect it. The rhetoric of this \nprotection is of course always public spirited; the reality is something \ndifferent. Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age, but that, left to \nthemselves, would crumble in another, are sustained through this subtle \ncorruption of our political process. RCA had what the Causbys did not: the power \nto stifle the effect of technological change.",
        "There’s no single inventor of the Internet. Nor is there any good date upon \nwhich to mark its birth. Yet in a very short time, the Internet has become part \nof ordinary American life. According to the Pew Internet and American Life \nProject, 58 percent of Americans had access to the Internet in 2002, up from 49 \npercent two years before. [7] That number could well exceed two thirds of the \nnation by the end of 2004.",
        "As the Internet has been integrated into ordinary life, it has changed things. \nSome of these changes are technicalthe Internet has made communication faster, \nit has lowered the cost of gathering data, and so on. These technical changes \nare not the focus of this book. They are important. They are not well \nunderstood. But they are the sort of thing that would simply go away if we all \njust switched the Internet off. They don’t affect people who don’t use the \nInternet, or at least they don’t affect them directly. They are the proper \nsubject of a book about the Internet. But this is not a book about the Internet.",
        "Instead, this book is about an effect of the Internet beyond the Internet \nitself: an effect upon how culture is made. My claim is that the Internet has \ninduced an important and unrecognized change in that process. That change will \nradically transform a tradition that is as old as the Republic itself. Most, if \nthey recognized this change, would reject it. Yet most don’t even see the change \nthat the Internet has introduced.",
        "We can glimpse a sense of this change by distinguishing between commercial and \nnoncommercial culture, and by mapping the law’s regulation of each. By \ncommercial culture I mean that part of our culture that is produced and sold \nor produced to be sold. By noncommercial culture I mean all the rest. When old \nmen sat around parks or on street corners telling stories that kids and others \nconsumed, that was noncommercial culture. When Noah Webster published his \nReader, or Joel Barlow his poetry, that was commercial culture.",
        "At the beginning of our history, and for just about the whole of our tradition, \nnoncommercial culture was essentially unregulated. Of course, if your stories \nwere lewd, or if your song disturbed the peace, then the law might intervene. \nBut the law was never directly concerned with the creation or spread of this \nform of culture, and it left this culture free. The ordinary ways in which \nordinary individuals shared and transformed their culturetelling stories, \nreenacting scenes from plays or TV, participating in fan clubs, sharing music, \nmaking tapeswere left alone by the law.",
        "The focus of the law was on commercial creativity. At first slightly, then quite \nextensively, the law protected the incentives of creators by granting them \nexclusive rights to their creative work, so that they could sell those exclusive \nrights in a commercial marketplace. [8] This is also, of course, an important \npart of creativity and culture, and it has become an increasingly important part \nin America. But in no sense was it dominant within our tradition. It was instead \njust one part, a controlled part, balanced with the free.",
        "This rough divide between the free and the controlled has now been erased. [9] \nThe Internet has set the stage for this erasure and, pushed by big media, the \nlaw has now affected it. For the first time in our tradition, the ordinary ways \nin which individuals create and share culture fall within the reach of the \nregulation of the law, which has expanded to draw within its control a vast \namount of culture and creativity that it never reached before. The technology \nthat preserved the balance of our historybetween uses of our culture that were \nfree and uses of our culture that were only upon permissionhas been undone. The \nconsequence is that we are less and less a free culture, more and more a \npermission culture. ",
        "This change gets justified as necessary to protect commercial creativity. And \nindeed, protectionism is precisely its motivation. But the protectionism that \njustifies the changes that I will describe below is not the limited and balanced \nsort that has defined the law in the past. This is not a protectionism to \nprotect artists. It is instead a protectionism to protect certain forms of \nbusiness. Corporations threatened by the potential of the Internet to change the \nway both commercial and noncommercial culture are made and shared have united to \ninduce lawmakers to use the law to protect them. It is the story of RCA and \nArmstrong; it is the dream of the Causbys.",
        "For the Internet has unleashed an extraordinary possibility for many to \nparticipate in the process of building and cultivating a culture that reaches \nfar beyond local boundaries. That power has changed the marketplace for making \nand cultivating culture generally, and that change in turn threatens established \ncontent industries. The Internet is thus to the industries that built and \ndistributed content in the twentieth century what FM radio was to AM radio, or \nwhat the truck was to the railroad industry of the nineteenth century: the \nbeginning of the end, or at least a substantial transformation. Digital \ntechnologies, tied to the Internet, could produce a vastly more competitive and \nvibrant market for building and cultivating culture; that market could include a \nmuch wider and more diverse range of creators; those creators could produce and \ndistribute a much more vibrant range of creativity; and depending upon a few \nimportant factors, those creators could earn more on average from this system \nthan creators do todayall so long as the RCAs of our day don’t use the law to \nprotect themselves against this competition.",
        "Yet, as I argue in the pages that follow, that is precisely what is happening in \nour culture today. These modern-day equivalents of the early twentieth-century \nradio or nineteenth-century railroads are using their power to get the law to \nprotect them against this new, more efficient, more vibrant technology for \nbuilding culture. They are succeeding in their plan to remake the Internet \nbefore the Internet remakes them.",
        "It doesn’t seem this way to many. The battles over copyright and the Internet \nseem remote to most. To the few who follow them, they seem mainly about a much \nsimpler brace of questionswhether piracy will be permitted, and whether \nproperty will be protected. The war that has been waged against the \ntechnologies of the Internetwhat Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) \npresident Jack Valenti calls his own terrorist war [10]has been framed as a \nbattle about the rule of law and respect for property. To know which side to \ntake in this war, most think that we need only decide whether we’re for property \nor against it.",
        "If those really were the choices, then I would be with Jack Valenti and the \ncontent industry. I, too, am a believer in property, and especially in the \nimportance of what Mr. Valenti nicely calls creative property. I believe that \npiracy is wrong, and that the law, properly tuned, should punish piracy, \nwhether on or off the Internet.",
        "But those simple beliefs mask a much more fundamental question and a much more \ndramatic change. My fear is that unless we come to see this change, the war to \nrid the world of Internet pirates will also rid our culture of values that \nhave been integral to our tradition from the start.",
        "These values built a tradition that, for at least the first 180 years of our \nRepublic, guaranteed creators the right to build freely upon their past, and \nprotected creators and innovators from either state or private control. The \nFirst Amendment protected creators against state control. And as Professor Neil \nNetanel powerfully argues, [11] copyright law, properly balanced, protected \ncreators against private control. Our tradition was thus neither Soviet nor the \ntradition of patrons. It instead carved out a wide berth within which creators \ncould cultivate and extend our culture.",
        "Yet the law’s response to the Internet, when tied to changes in the technology \nof the Internet itself, has massively increased the effective regulation of \ncreativity in America. To build upon or critique the culture around us one must \nask, Oliver Twistlike, for permission first. Permission is, of course, often \ngrantedbut it is not often granted to the critical or the independent. We have \nbuilt a kind of cultural nobility; those within the noble class live easily; \nthose outside it don’t. But it is nobility of any form that is alien to our \ntradition. ",
        "The story that follows is about this war. Is it not about the centrality of \ntechnology to ordinary life. I don’t believe in gods, digital or otherwise. Nor \nis it an effort to demonize any individual or group, for neither do I believe in \na devil, corporate or otherwise. It is not a morality tale. Nor is it a call to \njihad against an industry. ",
        "It is instead an effort to understand a hopelessly destructive war inspired by \nthe technologies of the Internet but reaching far beyond its code. And by \nunderstanding this battle, it is an effort to map peace. There is no good reason \nfor the current struggle around Internet technologies to continue. There will be \ngreat harm to our tradition and culture if it is allowed to continue unchecked. \nWe must come to understand the source of this war. We must resolve it soon.",
        "Like the Causbys’ battle, this war is, in part, about property. The property \nof this war is not as tangible as the Causbys’, and no innocent chicken has yet \nto lose its life. Yet the ideas surrounding this property are as obvious to \nmost as the Causbys’ claim about the sacredness of their farm was to them. We \nare the Causbys. Most of us take for granted the extraordinarily powerful claims \nthat the owners of intellectual property now assert. Most of us, like the \nCausbys, treat these claims as obvious. And hence we, like the Causbys, object \nwhen a new technology interferes with this property. It is as plain to us as it \nwas to them that the new technologies of the Internet are trespassing upon \nlegitimate claims of property. It is as plain to us as it was to them that the \nlaw should intervene to stop this trespass.",
        "And thus, when geeks and technologists defend their Armstrong or Wright brothers \ntechnology, most of us are simply unsympathetic. Common sense does not revolt. \nUnlike in the case of the unlucky Causbys, common sense is on the side of the \nproperty owners in this war. Unlike the lucky Wright brothers, the Internet has \nnot inspired a revolution on its side. ",
        "My hope is to push this common sense along. I have become increasingly amazed by \nthe power of this idea of intellectual property and, more importantly, its power \nto disable critical thought by policy makers and citizens. There has never been \na time in our history when more of our culture was as owned as it is now. \nAnd yet there has never been a time when the concentration of power to control \nthe uses of culture has been as unquestioningly accepted as it is now. ",
        "The puzzle is, Why?",
        "Is it because we have come to understand a truth about the value and importance \nof absolute property over ideas and culture? Is it because we have discovered \nthat our tradition of rejecting such an absolute claim was wrong?",
        "Or is it because the idea of absolute property over ideas and culture \nbenefits the RCAs of our time and fits our own unreflective intuitions?",
        "Is the radical shift away from our tradition of free culture an instance of \nAmerica correcting a mistake from its past, as we did after a bloody war with \nslavery, and as we are slowly doing with inequality? Or is the radical shift \naway from our tradition of free culture yet another example of a political \nsystem captured by a few powerful special interests?",
        "Does common sense lead to the extremes on this question because common sense \nactually believes in these extremes? Or does common sense stand silent in the \nface of these extremes because, as with Armstrong versus RCA, the more powerful \nside has ensured that it has the more powerful view?",
        "I don’t mean to be mysterious. My own views are resolved. I believe it was right \nfor common sense to revolt against the extremism of the Causbys. I believe it \nwould be right for common sense to revolt against the extreme claims made today \non behalf of intellectual property. What the law demands today is increasingly \nas silly as a sheriff arresting an airplane for trespass. But the consequences \nof this silliness will be much more profound. ",
        "The struggle that rages just now centers on two ideas: piracy and property. \nMy aim in this book’s next two parts is to explore these two ideas.",
        "My method is not the usual method of an academic. I don’t want to plunge you \ninto a complex argument, buttressed with references to obscure French theorists\nhowever natural that is for the weird sort we academics have become. Instead I \nbegin in each part with a collection of stories that set a context within which \nthese apparently simple ideas can be more fully understood.",
        "The two sections set up the core claim of this book: that while the Internet has \nindeed produced something fantastic and new, our government, pushed by big media \nto respond to this something new, is destroying something very old. Rather \nthan understanding the changes the Internet might permit, and rather than taking \ntime to let common sense resolve how best to respond, we are allowing those \nmost threatened by the changes to use their power to change the lawand more \nimportantly, to use their power to change something fundamental about who we \nhave always been.",
        "We allow this, I believe, not because it is right, and not because most of us \nreally believe in these changes. We allow it because the interests most \nthreatened are among the most powerful players in our depressingly compromised \nprocess of making law. This book is the story of one more consequence of this \nform of corruptiona consequence to which most of us remain oblivious.",
