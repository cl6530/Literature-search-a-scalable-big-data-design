        "Are these the only works of Providence in us? What words\nsuffice to praise or set them forth? Had we but understanding,\nshould we ever cease hymning and blessing the Divine Power, both\nopenly and in secret, and telling of His gracious gifts? Whether\ndigging or ploughing or eating, should we not sing the hymn to\nGod:—",
        "Thus should we ever have sung: yea and this, the grandest and\ndivinest hymn of all:—",
        "What then! seeing that most of you are blinded, should there\nnot be some one to fill this place, and sing the hymn to God on\nbehalf of all men? What else can I that am old and lame do but\nsing to God? Were I a nightingale, I should do after the manner\nof a nightingale. Were I a swan, I should do after the manner of\na swan. But now, since I am a reasonable being, I must sing to\nGod: that is my work: I do it, nor will I desert this my post, as\nlong as it is granted me to hold it; and upon you too I call to\njoin in this self-same hymn.",
