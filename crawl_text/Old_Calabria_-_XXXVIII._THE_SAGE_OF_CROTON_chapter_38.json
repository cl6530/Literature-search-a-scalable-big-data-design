        "The popularity of this sage at Croton offers no problem: the inhabitants\nhad become sufficiently civilized to appreciate the charm of being\nregenerated. We all do. Renunciation has always exercised an\nirresistible attraction for good society; it makes us feel so\ncomfortable, to be told we are going to hell–and Pythagoras was very\neloquent on the subject of Tartarus as a punishment. The Crotoniates\ndiscovered in repentance of sins a new and subtle form of pleasure;\nexactly as did the Florentines, when Savonarola appeared on the scene.",
        "Next: his doctrines found a ready soil in Magna Graecia which was\nalready impregnated with certain vague notions akin to those he\nintroduced. And then–he permitted and even encouraged the emotional sex\nto participate in the mysteries; the same tactics that later on\nmaterially helped the triumph of Christianity over the more exclusive\nand rational cult of Mithra. Lastly, he came with a “message,” like the\nApostle of the Gentiles; and in those times a preaching reformer was a\nnovelty. That added a zest. We know them a little better, nowadays.",
        "He enjoyed the specious and short-lived success that has attended,\nelsewhere, such efforts to cultivate the ego at the expense of its\nenvironment. “A type of aspiring humanity,” says Gissing, echoing the\nsentiments of many of us, “a sweet and noble figure, moving as a dim\nradiance through legendary Hellas.” I fancy that the mist of centuries\nof undiscriminating admiration has magnified this figure out of all\nproportion and contrived, furthermore, to fix an iridescent nimbus of\nsanctity about its head. Such things have been known to happen, in foggy\nweather.",
        "Was Greece so very legendary, in those times? Why, on the contrary, it\nwas full of real personages, of true sages to whom it seemed as if no\nsecrets of heaven or earth were past fathoming; far from being\nlegendary, the countryhad never attained a higher plane of intellectual\ncuriosity than when Pythagoras made his appearance. And it cannot be\ngainsaid that he and his disciples gave the impetus away from these wise\nand beneficial researches into the arid regions of metaphysics. It is so\nmuch more gentlemanly (and so much easier) to talk bland balderdash\nabout soul-migrations than to calculate an eclipse of the moon or bother\nabout the circulation of the blood.",
        "That a man of his speculative vigour, knowing so many extra-Hellenic\nraces, should have hit upon one or two good things adventitiously is\nonly to be expected. But they were mere by-products. One might as well\npraise John Knox for creating the commons of Scotland with a view to the\nfuture prosperity of that country–a consummation which his black\nfanaticism assuredly never foresaw.",
        "The chief practical doctrine of Pythagoras, that mankind are to be\ngoverned on the principle of a community of eastern monks, makes for the\ndisintegration of rational civic life.",
        "And his chief theoretical doctrines, of metempsychosis and the reduction\nof everything to a system of numbers [Footnote: Vincenzo Dorsa, an\nAlbanian, has written two pamphlets on the survival of Greco-Roman\ntraditions in Calabria. They are difficult to procure, but whoever is\nlucky enough to find them will be much helped in his understanding of\nthe common people. In one place, he speaks of the charm-formula of\nOtto-Nave! (Eight-Nine) It is considered meet and proper, in the\npresence of a suckling infant, to spit thrice and then call out, three\ntimes, Otto-Nove! This brings luck; and the practice, he thinks, is an\necho of the number-system of Pythagoras.]–these are sheer lunacy.",
        "Was it not something of a relapse, after the rigorous mental discipline\nof old, to have a man gravely assuring his fellows that he is the son of\nHermes and the divinely appointed messenger of Apollo; treating\ndiseases, like an Eskimo Angekok, by incantation; recording veracious\nincidents of his experiences during a previous life in Hell, which he\nseems to have explored almost as thoroughly as Swedenborg; dabbling in\nmagic, and consulting dreams, birds and the smoke of incense as oracles?\nAnd in the exotic conglomerate of his teachings are to be found the\nprima stamina of much that is worse: the theory of the pious fraud\nwhich has infected Latin countries to this day; the Jesuitical maxim of\nthe end justifying the means; the insanity of preferring deductions to\nfacts which has degraded philosophy up to the days of Kant; mysticism,\ndemon-worship and much else of pernicious mettle–they are all there,\nembryonically embedded in Pythagoras.",
        "We are told much of his charity; indeed, an English author has written a\nlearned work to prove that Pythagoreanism has close affinities with\nChristianity. Charity has now been tried on an ample scale, and has\nproved a dismal failure. To give, they say, is more blessed than to\nreceive. It is certainly far easier, for the most part, to give than to\nrefrain from giving. We are at last shaking off the form, of\nself-indulgence called charity; we realize that if mankind is to profit,\nsterner conceptions must prevail. The apotheosis of the god-favoured\nloafer is drawing to a close.",
        "For the rest, there was the inevitable admixture of quackery about our\nreforming sage; his warmest admirers cannot but admit that he savours\nsomewhat strongly of the holy impostor. Those charms and amulets, those\ndark gnomic aphorisms which constitute the stock-in-trade of all\nreligious cheap-jacks, the bribe of future life, the sacerdotal tinge\nwith its complement of mendacity, the secrecy of doctrine, the\npretentiously-mysterious self-retirement, the “sacred quaternion,” the\nbean-humbug . . .",
        "He had the true maraboutic note.",
        "And for me, this regenerator crowned with a saintly aureole remains a\nglorified marabout–an intellectual dissolvent; the importer of that\noriental introspectiveness which culminated in the idly-splendid\nyearnings of Plato, paved the way for the quaint Alexandrian\ntutti-frutti known as Christianity, and tainted the well-springs of\nhonest research for two thousand years. By their works ye shall known\nthem. It was the Pythagoreans who, not content with a just victory over\nthe Sybarites, annihilated their city amid anathemas worthy of those old\nChaldeans (past masters in the art of pious cursings); a crime against\ntheir common traditions and common interests; a piece of savagery which\nwrecked Hellenic civilization in Italy. It is ever thus, when the soul\nis appointed arbiter over reason. It is ever thus, when gentle,\ngod-fearing dreamers meddle with worldly affairs. Beware of the wrath of\nthe lamb!",
        "So rapidly did the virus act, that soon we find Plato declaring that all\nthe useful arts are degrading; that “so long as a man tries to study\nany sensible object, he can never be said to be learning anything\"; in\nother words, that the kind of person to whom one looks for common sense\nshould be excluded from the management of his most refined republic. It\nneeded courage of a rather droll kind to make such propositions in\nGreece, under the shadow of the Parthenon. And hand in hand with this\nfeudalism in philosophy there began that unhealthy preoccupation with\nthe morals of our fellow-creatures, that miasma of puritanism, which has\ninfected life and literature up to this moment.",
        "The Renaissance brought many fine things to England. But the wicked\nfairy was there with her gift: Pythagoras and Plato. We were not like\nthe Italians who, after the first rapture of discovery was over, soon\noutgrew these distracted dialectics; we stuck fast in them. Hence our\nPlatonic touch: our demi-vierge attitude in matters of the mind, our\nacademic horror of clean thinking. How Plato hated a fact! He could\nfind no place for it in his twilight world of abstractions. Was it not\nhe who wished to burn the works of Democritus of Abdera, most exact and\nreasonable of old sages?",
        "They are all alike, these humanitarian lovers of first causes. Always\nready to burn something, or somebody; always ready with their cheerful\nHell-fire and gnashing of teeth.",
        "Know thyself: to what depths of vain, egocentric brooding has that\ndictum led! But we are discarding, now, such a mischievously narrow view\nof the Cosmos, though our upbringing is still too rhetorical and\nmediaeval to appraise its authors at their true worth. Youth is prone to\njudge with the heart rather than the head; youth thrives on vaporous\nideas, and there was a time when I would have yielded to none in my\nenthusiasm for these mellifluous babblers; one had a blind, sentimental\nregard for their great names. It seems to me, now, that we take them\nsomewhat too seriously; that a healthy adult has nothing to learn from\ntheir teachings, save by way of warning example. Plato is food for\nadolescents. And a comfort, possibly, in old age, when the judicial\nfaculties of the mind are breaking up and primitive man, the visionary,\nreasserts his ancient rights. For questioning moods grow burdensome with\nyears; after a strain of virile doubt we are glad to acquiesce once\nmore–to relapse into Platonic animism, the logic of valetudinarians.\nThe dog to his vomit.",
        "And after Plato–the deluge. Neo-platonism. . . .",
        "Yet it was quite good sport, while it lasted. To “make men better” by\nchoice dissertations about Utopias, to sit in marble halls and have a\nfair and fondly ardent jeunesse doree reclining about your knees while\nyou discourse, in rounded periods, concerning the salvation of their\nsouls by means of transcendental Love–it would suit me well enough, at\nthis present moment; far better than croaking, forlorn as the\nnight-raven, among the ruins of their radiant lives.",
        "Meanwhile, and despite our Universities, new conceptions are prevailing,\nAristotle is winning the day. A fresh kind of thinker has arisen, whose\nchief idea of “virtue” is to investigate patiently the facts of life;\nmen of the type of Lister, any one of whom have done more to regenerate\nmankind, and to increase the sum of human happiness, than a wilderness\nof the amiably-hazy old doctrinaires who professed the same object. I\ncall to mind those physicians engaged in their malaria-campaign, and\nwonder what Plato would have thought of them. Would he have recognized the\nsignificance of their researches which, while allaying pain and misery,\nare furthering the prosperity of the country, causing waters to flow in\ndry places and villages to spring up in deserts–strengthening its\npolitical resources, improving its very appearance? Not likely. Plato’s\nopinion of doctors was on a par with the rest of his mentality. Yet\nthese are the men who are taking up the thread where it was dropped,\nperforce, by those veritable Greek sages, whelmed under turbid floods of\nPythagorean irrationalism. And are such things purely utilitarian? Are\nthey so grossly mundane? Is there really no “philosophy” in the choice\nof such a healing career, no romance in its studious self-denial, no\nbeauty in its results? If so, we must revise that classic adage which\nconnects vigour with beauty–not to speak of several others.",
