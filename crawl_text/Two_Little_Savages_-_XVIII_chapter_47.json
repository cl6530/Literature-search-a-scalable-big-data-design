        "The Owls and The Night School",
        "One night Sam was taking a last look at the stars before turning in. A\nHorned Owl had been hooting not far away.",
        "“_Hoo–hohoo-hoho–hoooooo.”",
        "And as he looked, what should silently sail to the top of the medicine\npole stuck in the ground twenty yards away but the Owl.",
        "“Yan! Yan! Give me my bow and arrow, quick. Here’s a Cat-Owl–a\nchicken stealer, he’s fair game.”",
        "“He’s only codding you, Yan,” said Guy sleepily from his blanket. “I\nwouldn’t go.”",
        "But Yan rushed out with his own and Sam’s weapons.",
        "Sam fired at the great feathery creature, but evidently missed, for\nthe Owl spread its wings and sailed away.",
        "“There goes my best arrow. That was my ’Sure-death.’”",
        "“Pshaw!” growled Yan, as he noted the miss. “You can’t shoot a little\nbit.”",
        "But as they stood, there was a fluttering of broad wings, and there,\nalighting as before on the medicine pole, was the Owl again.",
        "“My turn now!” exclaimed Yan in a gaspy whisper.",
        "He drew his bow, the arrow flew, and the Owl slipped off unharmed as\nit had the first time.",
        "“Yan, you’re no good. An easy shot like that. Why, any idiot could hit\nthat. Why didn’t you fetch her?”",
        "“’Cause I’m not an idiot, I suppose. I hit the same place as you did,\nanyway, and drew just as much blood.”",
        "“Ef he comes back again you call me,” piped Guy in his shrill voice.\n“I’ll show you fellers how to shoot. You’re no good at all ’thout me.\nWhy, I mind the time I was Deer-shooting––” but a fierce dash of the\nwhole Tribe for Sappy’s bed put a stop to the reminiscent flow and\nreplaced it with whines of “Now you let me alone. I ain’t doin’\nnothin’ to you.”",
        "During the night they were again awakened by the screech in the\ntree-tops, and Yan, sitting up, said, “Say, boys, that’s nothing but\nthat big Cat Owl.”",
        "“So it is,” was Sam’s answer; “wonder I didn’t think of that before.”",
        "“I did,” said Guy; “I knew it all the time.”",
        "In the morning they went out to find their arrows. The medicine pole\nwas a tall pole bearing a feathered shield, with the tribal totem, a\nwhite Buffalo, which Yan had set up to be in Indian fashion. Sighting\nin line from the teepee over this, they walked on, looking far beyond,\nfor they had learned always to draw the arrow to the head. They\nhad not gone twenty-five feet before Yan burst out in unutterable\nastonishment: “Look! Look at that–and that–––”",
        "There on the ground not ten feet apart were two enormous Horned Owls,\nboth shot fairly through the heart, one with Sam’s “Sure-death” arrow,\nthe other with Yan’s “Whistler\"; both shots had been true, and the\nboys could only say, “Well, if you saw that in print you would say it\nwas a big lie!” It was indeed one of those amazing things which happen\nonly in real life, and the whole of the Tribe with one exception voted\na grand coup to each of the hunters.",
        "Guy was utterly contemptuous. “They got so close they hit by chance\nan’ didn’t know they done it. If he had been shooting,” etc., etc.,\netc.",
        "“How about that screech in the tree-tops, Guy?”",
        "“Errrrh.”",
        "What a fascination the naturalist always finds in a fine Bird. Yan\nrevelled in these two. He measured their extent of wing and the length\nfrom beak to tail of each. He studied the pattern on their quills;\nhe was thrilled by their great yellow eyes and their long, powerful\nclaws, and he loved their every part. He hated to think that in a few\ndays these wonderful things would be disgusting and fit only to be\nburied.",
        "“I wish I knew hew to stuff them,” he said.",
        "“Why don’t you get Si Lee to show you,” was Sam’s suggestion. “Seems\nto me I often seen pictures of Injun medicine men with stuffed birds,\"\nhe added shrewdly and happily.",
        "“Well, that’s just what I will do.”",
        "Then arose a knotty question. Should he go to Si Lee and thereby turn\n“White” and break the charm of the Indian life, or should he attempt\nthe task of persuading Si to come down there to work without proper\nconveniences. They voted to bring Si to camp. “Da might think we was\nbacking out.” After all, the things needed were easily carried, and\nSi, having been ambushed by a scout, consented to come and open a\nnight-school in taxidermy.",
        "The tools and things that he brought were a bundle of tow made by\nunravelling a piece of rope, some cotton wool, strong linen thread,\ntwo long darning needles, arsenical soap worked up like cream,\ncorn-meal, some soft iron wire about size sixteen and some of\nstovepipe size, a file, a pair of pliers, wire cutters, a sharp knife,\na pair of stout scissors, a gimlet, two ready-made wooden stands, and\nlast of all a good lamp. The boys hitherto had been content with the\nfirelight.",
        "Thus in the forest teepee Yan had his first lesson in the art that was\nto give him so much joy and some sorrow in the future.",
        "Guy was interested, though scornful; Sam was much interested; Yan was\nsimply rapt, and Si Lee was in his glory. His rosy red cheeks and his\nround figure swelled with pride; even his semi-nude head and fat,\nfumbling fingers seemed to partake of his general elation and\nimportance.",
        "First he stuffed the Owls’ throats and wounds with cotton wool.",
        "Then he took one, cut a slit from the back of the breast-bone nearly\nto the tail (_A to B, Fig. 1), while Yan took the other and tried\nfaithfully to follow his example.",
        "He worked the skin from the body chiefly by the use of his finger\nnails, till he could reach the knee of each leg and cut this through\nat the joint with the knife (_Kn, Fig. 1). The flesh was removed from\neach leg-bone down to the heel-joint (_Hl, Hl, Fig. 1), leaving the\nleg and skin as in Lg, Figure 2. Then working back on each side of\nthe tail, he cut the “pope’s nose” from the body and left it as part\nof the skin, with the tail feathers in it, and this, Si explained, was\na hard place to get around. Sam called it “rounding Cape Horn.” As the\nflesh was exposed Si kept it powdered thickly with corn-meal, and this\nsaved the feathers from soiling.",
        "Once around Cape Horn it was easy sailing. The skin was rapidly pushed\noff till the wings were reached. These were cut off at the joint deep\nin the breast (under J J, Fig. 1, or seen on the back, W J, Fig. 2),\nthe first bone of each wing was cleared of meat, and the skin, now\ninside out and well mealed, was pushed off the neck up to the head.",
        "Here Si explained that in most birds it would slip easily over the head,\nbut in Owls, Woodpeckers, Ducks and some others one had sometimes to\nhelp it by a lengthwise slit on the nape (_Sn, Fig. 2). “Owls is hard,\nanyway,” he went on, “though not so bad as Water-fowl. If ye want a real\neasy bird for a starter, take a Robin or a Blackbird, or any land Bird\nabout that size except Woodpeckers.”",
        "When the ears were reached they were skinned and pulled out of the skull\nwithout cutting, then, after the eyes were passed, the skin and body\nlooked as in Figure 2. Now the back of the head with the neck and body\nwas cut off (_Ct, Fig. 2), and the first operation of the skinning was\ndone.",
        "Yan got along fairly well, tearing and cutting the skin once or twice,\nbut learning very quickly to manage it.",
        "Now began the cleaning of the skin.",
        "The eyes were cut clean out and the brains and flesh carefully scraped\naway from the skull.",
        "The wing bones were already cleaned of meat down to the elbow joint,\nwhere the big quill feathers began, and the rest of the wing had to\nbe cleared of flesh by cutting open the under side of the next joint\n(_H to El, Fig. 1). The “pope’s nose” and the skin generally was\nfreed from meat and grease by scraping with a knife and rubbing with\nthe meal.",
        "Then came the poisoning. Every part of the bones and flesh had to be\npainted with the creamy arsenical soap, then the head was worked back\ninto its place and the skin turned right side out.",
        "When this was done it was quite late. Guy was asleep, Sam was nearly\nso, and Yan was thoroughly tired out.",
        "“Guess I’ll go now,” said Si. “Them skins is in good shape to keep,\nonly don’t let them dry,” so they were wrapped up in a damp sack and\nput away in a tin till next night, when Si promised to return and\nfinish the course in one more lesson.",
        "[Illustration: Owl-stuffing plate]",
        "    Fig. 1. The dead Owl, showing the cuts made in skinning it: A to\n    B, for the body; El to H, on each wing, to remove the meat of the\n    second joint.",
        "    Fig. 2. After the skinning is done the skull remains attached to\n    the skin, which is now inside out, the neck and body are cut off\n    at Ct. Sn to Sn shows the slit in the nape needed for Owls and\n    several other kinds.",
        "    Fig. 3. Top view of the tow body, neck end up, and neck wire\n    projecting.",
        "    Fig. 4. Side view of the tow body, with the neck wire put through\n    it; the tail end is downward.",
        "    Fig. 5. The heavy iron wire for neck.",
        "    Fig. 6. The Owl after the body is put in; it is now ready to close\n    up, by stitching up the slit on the nape, the body slit B to C and\n    the two wing slits El to H, on each wing.",
        "    Fig. 7. A dummy as it would look if all the feathers were\n    off; this shows the proper position for legs and wings on the\n    body. At W is a glimpse of the leg wire entering the body at the\n    middle of the side.",
        "    Fig. 8. Another view of the body without feathers; the dotted\n    lines show the wires of the legs through the hard body, and the\n    neck wire.",
        "    Fig. 9. Two views of one of the wooden eyes; these are on a much\n    larger scale than the rest of the figures in this plate.",
        "    Fig. 10. The finished Owl, with the thread wrappings on and\n    the wires still projecting; Nw is end of the neck wire; Bp is\n    back-pin–that is, the wire in the center of the back; Ww and Ww\n    are the wing wires; Tl are the cards pinned on the tail to hold it\n    flat while it dries. The last operation is to remove the threads\n    and cut all the wires off close so that the feathers hide what\n    remains.",
        "While they were so working Sam had busied himself opening the Owls’\nstomachs–\"looking up their records,” as he called it. He now reported\nthat one had lynched a young Partridge and the other had killed a\nRabbit for its latest meal.",
        "Next night Si Lee came as promised, but brought bad news. He had\nfailed to find the glass Owl eyes he had hoped were in his trunk. His\ningenuity, however, was of the kind that is never balked in a small\nmatter. He produced some black and yellow oil paints, explaining,\n“Guess we’ll make wooden eyes do for the present, an’ when you get to\ntown you can put glass ones in their place.” So Sam was set to work\nwhittling four wooden eyes the shape of well-raised buns and about\nthree-quarters of an inch across. When whittled, scraped and smooth,\nSi painted them brilliant yellow with a central black spot and put\nthem away to dry (shown on a large scale on Owl Stuffing Plate, Fig. 9,\na and b_).",
        "Meanwhile, he and Yan got out the two skins. The bloody feathers on\nthe breasts were washed clean in a cup of warm water, then dried with\ncotton and dusted all over with meal to soak up any moisture left. The\nleg and wing bones were now wrapped with as much tow as would take the\nplace of the removed meat. The eye sockets were partly filled with\ncotton, then a long soft roll of tow about the length and thickness of\nthe original neck was worked up into the neck skin and into the skull\nand left hanging. The ends of the two wing bones were fastened two\ninches apart with a shackle of strong string (_X, Fig. 2 and\nFig. 7). Now the body was needed.",
        "For this Si rolled and lashed a wad of tow with strong thread until\nhe made a dummy of the same size and shape as the body taken out,\nsqueezing and sewing it into a hard solid mass. Next he cut about two\nand a half feet of the large wire, filed both ends sharp, doubled\nabout four inches of one end back in a hook (Fig. 5), then drove the\nlong end through the tow body from the tail end out where the neck\nshould join on (Figs. 3 and 4). This was driven well in so that the\nshort end of the hook was buried out of sight. Now Si passed the\nprojecting ends of the long wire up the neck in the middle of the tow\nroll or neck already there, worked it through the skull and out at the\ntop of the Owl’s head, and got the tow body properly placed in the\nskin with the string that bound the wing bones across the back\n(_X, Fig. 7).",
        "Two heavy wires each eighteen inches long and sharp at one end were\nneeded for the legs. These were worked up one through the sole of\neach foot under the skin of the leg behind (_Lw, Fig. 6), then\nthrough the tow body at the middle of the side (_W, Fig. 7),\nafter which the sharp end was bent with pliers into a hook and driven\nback into the hard body (after the manner of the neck wire, Fig. 4).",
        "Another wire was sharpened and driven through the bones of the tail,\nfastening that also to the tow body (_Tw, Fig. 7).",
        "Now a little soft tow was packed into places where it seemed needed\nto fit the skin on, and it remained to sew up the opening below\n(_Bc in Fig. 6), the wing slits (_El, H, Fig. 6 and Fig.\n1), and the slit in the nape (_Sn Sn, Fig. 2) with half a dozen\nstitches, always putting the needle into the skin from the flesh side.",
        "The projecting wires of the feet were put through gimlet holes in the\nperch and made firm, and Si’s Owls were ready for their positions.\nThey were now the most ridiculous looking things imaginable, wings\nfloppy, heads hanging.",
        "“Here is where the artist comes in,” said Si proudly, conscious that\nthis was himself. He straightened up the main line of the body by\nbending the leg wires and set the head right by hunching the neck into\nthe shoulders. “An Owl always looks over its shoulder,” he explained,\nbut took no notice of Sam’s query as to “whose shoulder he expected it\nto look over.” He set two toes of each foot forward on the perch and\ntwo back to please Yan, who insisted that that was Owly, though Si\nhad his doubts. He spread the tail a little by pinning it between two\npieces of card (_Tl, Fig. 10), gave it the proper slant, and now\nhad the wings to arrange.",
        "They were drooping like those of a clucking hen. A sharp wire of the\nsmall size was driven into the bend of each wing (_0, Fig. 7),\nnailing it in effect to the body (_Ww and Ww, Fig. 10). A long pin\nwas set in the middle of the back (_Bp, Fig. 10), then using these\nwith the wing wires and head wire as lashing points, Si wrapped the\nwhole bird with the thread (Fig. 10), putting a wad of cotton here or\na bit of stick there under the wrapping till he had the position and\n“feathering” perfect, as he put it.",
        "“We can put in the eyes now,” said he, “or later, if we soften\nthe skin around the eye-sockets by putting wet cotton in them for\ntwenty-four hours.”",
        "Yan had carefully copied Si’s method with the second Owl, and\ndeveloped unusual quickness at it.",
        "His teacher remarked, “Wall, I larned lots o’ fellows to stuff birds,\nbut you ketch on the quickest I ever seen.”",
        "Si’s ideas of perfection might differ from those of a trained\ntaxidermist; indeed, these same Owls afforded Yan no little amusement\nin later years, but for the present they were an unmitigated joy.",
        "They were just the same in position. Si knew only one; all his birds\nhad that. But when they had dried fully, had their wrappings removed,\nthe wires cut off flush and received the finishing glory of their\nwooden eyes, they were a source of joy and wonder to the whole Tribe\nof Indians.",
