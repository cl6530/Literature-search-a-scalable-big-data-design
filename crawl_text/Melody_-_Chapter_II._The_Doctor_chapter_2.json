        "The doctor sat in his buggy, leaning forward, and talking to the\nchild. A florid, jovial-looking man, bright-eyed and deep-chested,\nwith a voice like a trumpet, and a general air of being the West Wind\nin person. He was not alone this time: another doctor sat beside him;\nand Miss Vesta smoothed her ruffled front at sight of the stranger.",
        "“Good-morning, Vesta,” shouted the doctor, cheerily. “You came out to\nshoot me, because you thought I was coming to carry off Melody, eh?\nYou needn’t say no, for I know your musket-shot expression. Dr.\nAnthony, let me present you to Miss Vesta Dale,–a woman who has never\nhad the grace to have a day’s sickness since I have known her, and\nthat’s forty years at least.”",
        "“Miss Dale is a fortunate woman,” said Dr. Anthony, smiling. “Have you\nmany such constitutions in your practice, Brown?”",
        "“I am fool enough to wish I had,” growled Dr Brown. “That woman, sir,\nis enough to ruin any practice, with her pernicious example of\ndisgusting health. How is Rejoice this morning, Vesta? Does she want\nto see me?”",
        "Miss Vesta thought not, to-day; then followed questions and answers,\nsearching on one side, careful and exact on the other; and then–",
        "“I should like it if you could spare Melody for half an hour this\nmorning,” said the doctor. “I want her to go down to Phoebe Jackson’s\nto see little Ned.”",
        "“Oh, what is the matter with Ned?” cried Melody, with a quick look of\nalarm.",
        "“Tomfoolery is the principal matter with him, my dear,” said Dr.\nBrown, grimly. “His eyes have been troubling him, you know, ever since\nhe had the measles in the winter. I’ve kept one eye on the child,\nknowing that his mother was a perfect idiot, or rather, an imperfect\none, which is worse. Yesterday she sent for me in hot haste: Ned was\ngoing blind, and would I please come that minute, and save the\nprecious child, and oh, dear me, what should she do, and all the rest\nof it. I went down mad enough, I can tell you; found the child’s eyes\nlooking like a ploughed field. ’What have you been doing to this\nchild, Phffibe?’ ’We-ell, Doctor, his eyes has been kind o’ bad along\nback, the last week. I did cal’late to send for you before; but one o’\nthe neighbors was in, and she said to put molasses and tobacco-juice\nin them.’ ’Thunder and turf!’ says I. ’What sa-ay?’ says Phoebe. ’’N’\nthen old Mis’ Barker come in last night. You know she’s had\nconsid’able experi’nce with eyes, her own having been weakly, and all\nher children’s after her. And she said to try vitriol; but I kind o’\nthought I’d ask you first, Doctor, so I waited till morning. And now\nhis eyes look terrible, and he seems dretful ’pindlin’; oh, dear me,\nwhat shall I do if my poor little Neddy goes blind?’ ’Do, Madam?’ I\nsaid. ’You will have the satisfaction of knowing that you and your\ntobacco-juice and molasses have made him blind. That’s what you will\ndo, and much good may it do you.’”",
        "“Oh, Doctor,” cried Melody, shrinking as if the words had been\naddressed to her, “how could you say that? But you don’t think–you\ndon’t think Ned will really be blind?” The child had grown very pale,\nand she leaned over the gate with clasped hands, in painful suspense.",
        "“No, I don’t,” replied the doctor. “I think he will come out all\nright; no thanks to his mother if he does. But it was necessary to\nfrighten the woman, Melody, for fright is the only thing that makes an\nimpression on a fool. Now, I want you to run down there, like a good\nchild; that is, if your aunts can spare you. Run down and comfort the\nlittle fellow, who has been badly scared by the clack of tongues and\nthe smarting of the tobacco-juice. Imbeciles! cods’ heads! scooped-out\npumpkins!” exclaimed the doctor, in a sudden frenzy. “A–I don’t mean\nthat. Comfort him up, child, and sing to him and tell him about\nJack-and-the-Beanstalk. You’ll soon bring him round, I’ll warrant.\nBut stop,” he added, as the child, after touching Miss Vesta’s hand\nlightly, and making and receiving I know not what silent\ncommunication, turned toward the house,–\"stop a moment, Melody. My\nfriend Dr. Anthony here is very fond of music, and he would like to\nhear you sing just one song. Are you in singing trim this morning?”",
        "The child laughed. “I can always sing, of course,” she said simply.\n“What song would you like, Doctor?”",
        "“Oh, the best,” said Dr. Brown. “Give us ’Annie Laurie.’”",
        "The child sat down on a great stone that stood beside the gate. It was\njust under the white lilac-bush, and the white clusters bent lovingly\ndown over her, and seemed to murmur with pleasure as the wind swept\nthem lightly to and fro. Miss Vesta said something about her bread,\nand gave an uneasy glance toward the house, but she did not go in; the\nwindow was open, and Rejoice could hear; and after all, bread was not\nworth so much as “Annie Laurie.” Melody folded her hands lightly on\nher lap, and sang.",
        "Dr. Brown thought “Annie Laurie” the most beautiful song in the world;\ncertainly it is one of the best beloved. Ever since it was first\nwritten and sung (who knows just when that was? “Anonymous” is the\nlegend that stands in the song-books beside this familiar title. We do\nnot know the man’s name, cannot visit the place where he wrote and\nsang, and made music for all coming generations of English-speaking\npeople; can only think of him as a kind friend, a man of heart and\ngenius as surely as if his name stood at the head of unnumbered\nsymphonies and fugues),–ever since it was first sung, I say, men and\nwomen and children have loved this song. We hear of its being sung by\ncamp-fires, on ships at sea, at gay parties of pleasure. Was it not at\nthe siege of Lucknow that it floated like a breath from home through\nthe city hell-beset, and brought cheer and hope and comfort to all who\nheard it? The cotter’s wife croons it over her sleeping baby; the\nlover sings it to his sweetheart; the child runs, carolling it,\nthrough the summer fields; finally, some world-honored prima-donna,\nsome Patti or Nilsson, sings it as the final touch of perfection to a\ngreat feast of music, and hearts swell and eyes overflow to find that\nthe nursery song of our childhood is a world-song, immortal in\nfreshness and beauty. But I am apt to think that no lover, no tender\nmother, no splendid Italian or noble Swede, could sing “Annie Laurie\"\nas Melody sang it. Sitting there in her simple cotton dress, her head\nthrown slightly back, her hands folded, her eyes fixed in their\nunchanging calm, she made a picture that the stranger never forgot. He\nstarted as the first notes of her voice stole forth, and hung\nquivering on the air,–",
        "   “Maxwellton braes are bonnie,\n   Where early fa’s the dew.”",
        "What wonder was this? Dr. Anthony had come prepared to hear, he quite\nknew what,–a child’s voice, pretty, perhaps, thin and reedy, nasal,\nof course. His good friend Brown was an excellent physician, but with\nno knowledge of music; how should he have any, living buried in the\ncountry, twenty miles from a railway, forty miles from a concert?\nBrown had said so much about the blind child that it would have been\ndiscourteous for him, Dr. Anthony, to refuse to see and hear her when\nhe came to pass a night with his old college chum; but his assent had\nbeen rather wearily given: Dr. Anthony detested juvenile prodigies.\nBut what was this? A voice full and round as the voices of Italy;\nclear as a bird’s; swelling ever richer, fuller, rising in tones so\npure, so noble, that the heart of the listener ached, as the poet’s\nheart at hearing the nightingale, with almost painful pleasure.\nAmazement and delight made Dr. Anthony’s face a study, which his\nfriend perused with keen enjoyment. He knew, good Dr. Brown, that he\nhimself was a musical nobody; he knew pretty well (what does a doctor\nnot know?) what Anthony was thinking as they drove along. But he knew\nMelody too; and he rubbed his hands, and chuckled inwardly at the\ndiscomfiture of his knowing friend.",
        "The song died away; and the last notes were like those of the skylark\nwhen she sinks into her nest at sunset. The listeners drew breath, and\nlooked at each other.",
        "There was a brief silence, and then, “Thank you, Melody,” said Dr.\nBrown. “That’s the finest song in the world, I don’t care what the\nnext is. Now run along, like my good maid, and sing it to Neddy\nJackson, and he will forget all about his eyes, and turn into a great\npair of ears.”",
        "The child laughed. “Neddy will want ’The British Grenadier,’” she\nsaid. “That is his greatest song.” She ran into the house to kiss\nMiss Rejoice, came out with her sun-bonnet tied under her chin, and\nlifted her face to kiss Miss Vesta. “I sha’n’t be gone long, Auntie,\"\nshe said brightly. “There’ll be plenty of time to make the cake after\ndinner.”",
        "Miss Vesta smoothed the dark hair with a motherly touch. “Doctor\ndoesn’t care anything about our cake,” she said; “he isn’t coming to\ntea to-night. I suppose you’d better stay as long as you’re needed. I\nshould not want the child to fret.”",
        "“Good-by, Doctor,” cried the child, joyously, turning her bright face\ntoward the buggy. “Good-by, sir,” making a little courtesy to Dr.\nAnthony, who gravely took off his hat and bowed as if to a duchess.\n“Good-by again, dear auntie;” and singing softly to herself, she\nwalked quickly away.",
        "Dr. Anthony looked after her, silent for a while. “Blind from birth?\"\nhe asked presently.",
        "“From birth,” replied Dr. Brown. “No hope; I’ve had Strong down to see\nher. But she’s the happiest creature in the world, I do believe. How\ndoes she sing?” he asked with ill-concealed triumph. “Pretty well for\na country child, eh?”",
        "“She sings like an angel,” said Dr. Anthony,–\"like an angel from\nheaven.”",
        "“She has a right to, sir,” said Miss Vesta, gravely. “She is a child\nof God, who has never forgotten her Father.”",
        "Dr. Anthony turned toward the speaker, whom he had almost forgotten in\nhis intense interest in the child. “This lovely child is your own\nniece, Madam?” he inquired. “She must be unspeakably dear to you.”",
        "Miss Vesta flushed. She did not often speak as she had just done,\nbeing a New England woman; but “Annie Laurie” always carried her out\nof herself, she declared. The answer to the gentleman’s question was\none she never liked to make. “She is not my niece in blood,” she said\nslowly. “We are single women, my sister and I; but she is like our own\ndaughter to us.”",
        "“Twelve years this very month, Vesta, isn’t it,” said Dr. Brown,\nkindly, “since the little one came to you? Do you remember what a wild\nnight it was?”",
        "Miss Vesta nodded. “I hear the wind now when I think of it,” she said.",
        "“The child is an orphan,” the doctor continued, turning to his friend.\n“Her mother was a young Irish woman, who came here looking for work.\nShe was poor, her husband dead, consumption on her, and so on, and so\non. She died at the poorhouse, and left this blind baby. Tell Dr.\nAnthony how it happened, Vesta.”",
        "Miss Vesta frowned and blushed. She wished Doctor would remember that\nhis friend was a stranger to her. But in a moment she raised her head.\n“There’s nothing to be ashamed of, after all,” she said, a little\nproudly. “I don’t know why I should not tell you, sir. I went up to\nthe poor-farm one evening, to carry a basket of strawberries. We had a\ngreat quantity, and I thought some of the people up there might like\nthem, for they had few luxuries, though I don’t believe they ever went\nhungry. And when I came there, Mrs. Green, who kept the farm then,\ncame out looking all in a maze. ’Did you ever hear of such a thing in\nyour life?’ she cried out, the minute she set eyes on me. ’I don’t\nknow, I’m sure,’ said I. ’Perhaps I did, and perhaps I didn’t. How’s\nthe baby that poor soul left?’ I said. It was two weeks since the\nmother died; and to tell the truth, I went up about as much to see how\nthe child was getting on as to take the strawberries, though I don’t\nknow that I realized it till this very minute.” She smiled grimly, and\nwent on. “’That’s just it,’ Mrs. Green screams out, right in my face.\n’Dr. Brown has just been here, and he says the child is blind, and\nwill be blind all her days, and we’ve got to bring her up; and I’d\nlike to know if I haven’t got enough to do without feedin’ blind\nchildren?’ I just looked at her. ’I don’t know that a deaf woman would\nbe much better than a blind child,’ said I; ’so I’ll thank you to\nspeak like a human being, Liza Green, and not scream at me. Aren’t you\nashamed?’ I said. ’The child can’t help being blind, I suppose. Poor\nlittle lamb! as if it hadn’t enough, with no father nor mother in the\nworld.’ ’I don’t care,’ says Liza, crazy as ever; ’I can’t stand it.\nI’ve got all I can stand now, with a feeble-minded boy and two so old\nthey can’t feed themselves. That Polly is as crazy as a loon, and the\nrest is so shif’less it loosens all my j’ints to look at ’em. I won’t\nstand no more, for Dr. Brown nor anybody else.’ And she set her hands\non her hips and stared at me as if she’d like to eat me, sun-bonnet\nand all. ’Let me see the child,’ I said. I went in, and there it\nlay,–the prettiest creature you ever saw in your life, with its eyes\nwide open, just as they are now, and the sweetest look on its little\nface. Well, there, you’d know it came straight from heaven, if you saw\nit in–Well, I don’t know exactly what I’m saying. You must excuse me,\nsir!” and Miss Vesta paused in some confusion. “’Somebody ought to\nadopt it,’ said I. ’It’s a beautiful child; any one might be proud of\nit when it grew up.’ ’I guess when you find anybody that would adopt a\nblind child, you’ll find the cat settin’ on hen’s eggs,’ said Liza\nGreen. I sat and held the child a little while, trying to think of\nsome one who would be likely to take care of it; but I couldn’t think\nof any one, for as she said, so it was. By and by I kissed the poor\nlittle pretty thing, and laid it back in its cradle, and tucked it up\nwell, though it was a warm night. ’You’ll take care of that child,\nLiza,’ I said, ’as long as it stays with you, or I’ll know the reason\nwhy. There are plenty of people who would like the work here, if\nyou’re tired of it,’ I said. She quieted down at that, for she knew\nthat a word from me would set the doctor to thinking, and he wasn’t\ngoing to have that blind child slighted, well I knew. Well, sir, I\ncame home, and told Rejoice.”",
        "“Her sister,” put in Dr. Brown,–\"a crippled saint, been in her bed\nthirty years. She and Melody keep a small private heaven, and Vesta is\nthe only sinner admitted.”",
        "“Doctor, you’re very profane,” said Miss Vesta, reprovingly. “I’ve\nnever seen my sister Rejoice angry, sir, except that one time, when I\ntold her. ’Where is the child?’ she says. ’Why, where do you suppose?’\nsaid I. ’In its cradle, of course. I tucked it up well before I came\naway, and she won’t dare to mistreat it for one while,’ I said. ’Go\nand get it!’ says my sister Rejoice. ’How dared you come home without\nit? Go and get it this minute, do you hear?’ I stared as if I had seen\na vision. ’Rejoice, what are you thinking of?’ I asked. ’Bring that\nchild here? Why, what should we do with it? I can’t take care of it,\nnor you either.’ My sister turned the color of fire. ’No one else\nshall take care of it,’ she says, as if she was Bunker Hill Monument\non a pillow. ’Go and get it this minute, Vesta. Don’t wait; the Lord\nmust not be kept waiting. Go, I tell you!’ She looked so wild I was\nfairly frightened; so I tried to quiet her. I thought her mind was\ntouched, some way. ’Well, I’ll go to-morrow,’ says I, soothing her; ’I\ncouldn’t go now, anyhow, Rejoice. Just hear it rain and blow! It came\non just as I stepped inside the door, and it’s a regular storm now. Be\nquiet,’ I said, ’and I’ll go up in the morning and see about it.’ My\nsister sat right up in the bed. ’You’ll go now,’ she says, ’or I’ll go\nmyself. Now, this living minute! Quick!’ I went, sir. The fire in her\neyes would have scorched me if I had looked at it a minute longer. I\nthought she was coming out of the bed after me,–she, who had not\nstirred for twenty years. I caught up a shawl, threw another over my\nshoulders, and ran for the poor-farm. ’T was a perfect tempest, but I\nnever felt it. Something seemed to drive me, as if it was a whip laid\nacross my shoulders. I thought it was my sister’s eyes, that had never\nlooked hard at me since she was born; but maybe it was something else\nbesides. They say there are no miracles in these days, but we don’t\nknow everything yet. I ran in at the farm, before them all, dripping,\nlooking like a maniac, I don’t doubt. I caught up the child out of the\ncradle, and wrapped it in the shawl I’d brought, and ran off again\nbefore they’d got their eyes shut from staring at me as if I was a\nspirit of evil. How my breath held out, don’t ask me; but I got home,\nand ran into the chamber, and laid the child down by the side of my\nsister Rejoice.”",
        "Miss Vesta paused, and the shadow of a great awe crept into her keen\nblue eyes. “The poor-farm was struck by lightning that night!” she\nsaid. “The cradle where that baby was lying was shattered into\nkindling-wood, and Liza Green has never been the same woman from that\nday to this.”",
