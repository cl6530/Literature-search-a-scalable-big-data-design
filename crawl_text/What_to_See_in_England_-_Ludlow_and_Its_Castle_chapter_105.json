        "Beautifully situated in a lovely valley surrounded by wooded hills,\nLudlow presents a picture of an ancient but prosperous city. The town is\nplaced at the meeting of two small rivers, the Teme and Corve, which\nflow into the Severn. On the top of a hill in the western part of the\ntown is the old castle, which was a royal residence from early times. It\nwas built at the time of the Conquest, and was the most important of all\nthe castles that guarded the Welsh border. The eldest son of Edward IV.\nlived in the castle under the guardianship of his uncle, Lord Rivers,\nand he was proclaimed king there when only twelve years old. Prince\nArthur, the first husband of Katharine of Aragon, and the eldest son of\nHenry VII., was also brought up and educated in the castle. In the Civil\nWar the Parliamentary troops partially destroyed the castle, but it was\nnot until the reign of George I. that the buildings were unroofed for\nthe sake of their lead.",
        "Sir Henry Sidney, the father of the famous Sir Philip Sidney, resided at\nLudlow, being President of the Council of Wales. In the Great Hall, now\nroofless, Milton’s masque Comus was performed for the first time, and\nSamuel Butler is said to have written part of Hudibras in a little\nroom over the entrance gateway.",
        "The Parish Church, also situated at the top of the hill, is mainly a\nfifteenth-century building, although it contains some earlier work. The\nfine east window, occupying the whole breadth of the chancel, is filled\nwith very old stained glass, depicting the life of St. Lawrence. There\nis a round church in the castle, said to be one of the earliest circular\nchurches in England. The streets are full of picturesque old houses, the\nmost celebrated being the “Feathers Inn,” a beautiful Jacobean house\ncontaining a coffee-room which has a most elaborately decorated plaster\nceiling and fine oak-panelled walls. The appearance of the room is\nexceedingly rich. The Grammar School, founded by the Guild of Palmers,\nclaims to be the oldest in England.",
