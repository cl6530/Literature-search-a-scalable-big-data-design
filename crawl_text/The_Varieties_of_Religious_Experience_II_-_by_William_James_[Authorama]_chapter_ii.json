        "The last lecture left us in a state of expectancy.  What may the\npractical fruits for life have been, of such movingly happy\nconversions as those we heard of?  With this question the really\nimportant part of our task opens, for you remember that we began\nall this empirical inquiry not merely to open a curious chapter\nin the natural history of human consciousness, but rather to\nattain a spiritual judgment as to the total value and positive\nmeaning of all the religious trouble and happiness which we have\nseen.  We must, therefore, first describe the fruits of the\nreligious life, and then we must judge them.  This divides our\ninquiry into two distinct parts.  Let us without further preamble\nproceed to the descriptive task.",
        "It ought to be the pleasantest portion of our business in these\nlectures.  Some small pieces of it, it is true, may be painful,\nor may show human nature in a pathetic light, but it will be\nmainly pleasant, because the best fruits of religious experience\nare the best things that history has to show.  They have always\nbeen esteemed so; here if anywhere is the genuinely strenuous\nlife; and to call to mind a succession of such examples as I have\nlately had to wander through, though it has been only in the\nreading of them, is to feel encouraged and uplifted and washed in\nbetter moral air.",
        "The highest flights of charity, devotion, trust, patience,\nbravery to which the wings of human nature have spread themselves\nhave been flown for religious ideals.  I can do no better than\nquote, as to this, some remarks which Sainte-Beuve in his History\nof Port-Royal makes on the results of conversion or the state of\ngrace.",
        "“Even from the purely human point of view,” Sainte-Beuve says,\n\"the phenomenon of grace must still appear sufficiently\nextraordinary, eminent, and rare, both in its nature and in its\neffects, to deserve a closer study.  For the soul arrives thereby\nat a certain fixed and invincible state, a state which is\ngenuinely heroic, and from out of which the greatest deeds which\nit ever performs are executed.  Through all the different forms\nof communion, and all the diversity of the means which help to\nproduce this state, whether it be reached by a jubilee, by a\ngeneral confession, by a solitary prayer and effusion, whatever\nin short to be the place and the occasion, it is easy to\nrecognize that it is fundamentally one state in spirit and\nfruits.  Penetrate a little beneath the diversity of\ncircumstances, and it becomes evident that in Christians of\ndifferent epochs it is always one and the same modification by\nwhich they are affected:  there is veritably a single fundamental\nand identical spirit of piety and charity, common to those who\nhave received grace; an inner state which before all things is\none of love and humility, of infinite confidence in God, and of\nseverity for one’s self, accompanied with tenderness for others. \nThe fruits peculiar to this condition of the soul have the same\nsavor in all, under distant suns and in different surroundings,\nin Saint Teresa of Avila just as in any Moravian brother of\nHerrnhut.\"[143]",
        "[143] Sainte-Beuve:  Port-Royal, vol. i. pp. 95 and 106,\nabridged.",
        "Sainte-Beuve has here only the more eminent instances of\nregeneration in mind, and these are of course the instructive\nones for us also to consider.  These devotees have often laid\ntheir course so differently from other men that, judging them by\nworldly law, we might be tempted to call them monstrous\naberrations from the path of nature.  I begin therefore by asking\na general psychological question as to what the inner conditions\nare which may make one human character differ so extremely from\nanother.",
        "I reply at once that where the character, as something\ndistinguished from the intellect, is concerned, the causes of\nhuman diversity lie chiefly in our differing susceptibilities of\nemotional excitement, and in the different impulses and\ninhibitions which these bring in their train.  Let me make this\nmore clear.",
        "Speaking generally, our moral and practical attitude, at any\ngiven time, is always a resultant of two sets of forces within\nus, impulses pushing us one way and obstructions and inhibitions\nholding us back.  “Yes! yes!” say the impulses; “No! no!” say the\ninhibitions.  Few people who have not expressly reflected on the\nmatter realize how constantly this factor of inhibition is upon\nus, how it contains and moulds us by its restrictive pressure\nalmost as if we were fluids pent within the cavity of a jar.  The\ninfluence is so incessant that it becomes subconscious.  All of\nyou, for example, sit here with a certain constraint at this\nmoment, and entirely without express consciousness of the fact,\nbecause of the influence of the occasion.  If left alone in the\nroom, each of you would probably involuntarily rearrange himself,\nand make his attitude more “free and easy.”  But proprieties and\ntheir inhibitions snap like cobwebs if any great emotional\nexcitement supervenes.  I have seen a dandy appear in the street\nwith his face covered with shaving-lather because a house across\nthe way was on fire; and a woman will run among strangers in her\nnightgown if it be a question of saving her baby’s life or her\nown.  Take a self-indulgent woman’s life in general.  She will\nyield to every inhibition set by her disagreeable sensations, lie\nlate in bed, live upon tea or bromides, keep indoors from the\ncold.  Every difficulty finds her obedient to its “no.”  But make\na mother of her, and what have you?  Possessed by maternal\nexcitement, she now confronts wakefulness, weariness, and toil \nwithout an instant of hesitation or a word of complaint. The\ninhibitive power of pain over her is extinguished wherever the\nbaby’s interests are at stake.  The inconveniences which this\ncreature occasions have become, as James Hinton says, the glowing\nheart of a great joy, and indeed are now the very conditions\nwhereby the joy becomes most deep.",
        "This is an example of what you have already heard of as the\n\"expulsive power of a higher affection.”  But be the affection\nhigh or low, it makes no difference, so long as the excitement it\nbrings be strong enough.  In one of Henry Drummond’s discourses\nhe tells of an inundation in India where an eminence with a\nbungalow upon it remained unsubmerged, and became the refuge of a\nnumber of wild animals and reptiles in addition to the human\nbeings who were there.  At a certain moment a royal Bengal tiger\nappeared swimming towards it, reached it, and lay panting like a\ndog upon the ground in the midst of the people, still possessed\nby such an agony of terror that one of the Englishmen could\ncalmly step up with a rifle and blow out its brains.  The tiger’s\nhabitual ferocity was temporarily quelled by the emotion of fear,\nwhich became sovereign, and formed a new centre for his\ncharacter.",
        "Sometimes no emotional state is sovereign, but many contrary ones\nare mixed together.  In that case one hears both “yeses” and\n\"noes,” and the “will” is called on then to solve the conflict. \nTake a soldier, for example, with his dread of cowardice\nimpelling him to advance, his fears impelling him to run, and his\npropensities to imitation pushing him towards various courses if\nhis comrades offer various examples.  His person becomes the seat\nof a mass of interferences; and he may for a time simply waver,\nbecause no one emotion prevails.  There is a pitch of intensity,\nthough, which, if any emotion reach it, enthrones that one as\nalone effective and sweeps its antagonists and all their\ninhibitions away.  The fury of his comrades’ charge, once entered\non, will give this pitch of courage to the soldier; the panic of\ntheir rout will give this pitch of fear.  In these sovereign\nexcitements, things ordinarily impossible grow natural because\nthe inhibitions are annulled.  Their “no! no!” not only is not\nheard, it does not exist.  Obstacles are then like tissue-paper\nhoops to the circus rider–no impediment; the flood is higher\nthan the dam they make.",
        "“Lass sie betteln gehn wenn sie hungrig sind!” cries the\ngrenadier, frantic over his Emperor’s capture, when his wife and\nbabes are suggested; and men pent into a burning theatre have\nbeen known to cut their way through the crowd with knives.[144]",
        "[144] “’Love would not be love,’ says Bourget, ’unless it could\ncarry one to crime.’  And so one may say that no passion would be\na veritable passion unless it could carry one to crime.”   \n(Sighele:  Psychollogie des sectes, p. 136.) In other words,\ngreat passions annul the ordinary inhibitions set by\n\"conscience.”  And conversely, of all the criminal human beings,\nthe false, cowardly, sensual, or cruel persons who actually live,\nthere is perhaps not one whose criminal impulse may not be at\nsome moment overpowered by the presence of some other emotion to\nwhich his character is also potentially liable, provided that\nother emotion be only made intense enough.  Fear is usually the\nmost available emotion for this result in this particular class\nof persons.  It stands for conscience, and may here be classed\nappropriately as a “higher affection.”  If we are soon to die, or\nif we believe a day of judgment to be near at hand, how quickly\ndo we put our moral house in order–we do not see how sin can\nevermore exert temptation over us! Old-fashioned hell-fire\nChristianity well knew how to extract from fear its full\nequivalent in the way of fruits for repentance, and its full\nconversion value.",
        "One mode of emotional excitability is exceedingly important in\nthe composition of the energetic character, from its peculiarly\ndestructive power over inhibitions.  I mean what in its lower\nform is mere irascibility, susceptibility to wrath, the fighting\ntemper; and what in subtler ways manifests itself as impatience,\ngrimness, earnestness, severity of character. Earnestness means\nwillingness to live with energy, though energy bring pain.  The\npain may be pain to other people or pain to one’s self–it makes\nlittle difference; for when the strenuous mood is on one, the aim\nis to break something, no matter whose or what.  Nothing\nannihilates an inhibition as irresistibly as anger does it; for,\nas Moltke says of war, destruction pure and simple is its\nessence.  This is what makes it so invaluable an ally of every\nother passion.  The sweetest delights are trampled on with a\nferocious pleasure the moment they offer themselves as checks to\na cause by which our higher indignations are elicited.  It costs\nthen nothing to drop friendships, to renounce long-rooted\nprivileges and possessions, to break with social ties.  Rather do\nwe take a stern joy in the astringency and desolation; and what\nis called weakness of character seems in most cases to consist in\nthe inaptitude for these sacrificial moods, of which one’s own\ninferior self and its pet softnesses must often be the targets\nand the victims.[145]",
        "[145] Example:  Benjamin Constant was often marveled at as an\nextraordinary instance of superior intelligence with inferior\ncharacter.  He writes (Journal, Paris, 1895, p. 56), “I am tossed\nand dragged about by my miserable weakness.  Never was anything\nso ridiculous as my indecision.  Now marriage, now solitude; now\nGermany, now France hesitation upon hesitation, and all because\nat bottom I am UNABLE TO GIVE UP ANYTHING.”  He can’t “get mad\"\nat any of his alternatives; and the career of a man beset by such\nan all-round amiability is hopeless.",
        "So far I have spoken of temporary alterations produced by\nshifting excitements in the same person.  But the relatively\nfixed differences of character of different persons are explained\nin a precisely similar way.  In a man with a liability to a\nspecial sort of emotion, whole ranges of inhibition habitually\nvanish, which in other men remain effective, and other sorts of\ninhibition take their place.  When a person has an inborn genius\nfor certain emotions, his life differs strangely from that of\nordinary people, for none of their usual deterrents check him. \nYour mere aspirant to a type of character, on the contrary, only\nshows, when your natural lover, fighter, or reformer, with whom\nthe passion is a gift of nature, comes along, the hopeless\ninferiority of voluntary to instinctive action.  He has\ndeliberately to overcome his inhibitions; the genius with the\ninborn passion seems not to feel them at all; he is free of all\nthat inner friction and nervous waste.  To a Fox, a Garibaldi, a\nGeneral Booth, a John Brown, a Louise Michel, a Bradlaugh, the\nobstacles omnipotent over those around them are as if\nnon-existent.  Should the rest of us so disregard them, there\nmight be many such heroes, for many have the wish to live for\nsimilar ideals, and only the adequate degree of\ninhibition-quenching fury is lacking.[146]",
        "[146] The great thing which the higher excitabilities give is\nCOURAGE; and the addition or subtraction of a certain amount of\nthis quality makes a different man, a different life.  Various\nexcitements let the courage loose.  Trustful hope will do it;\ninspiring example will do it; love will do it, wrath will do it. \nIn some people it is natively so high that the mere touch of\ndanger does it, though danger is for most men the great inhibitor\nof action.  “Love of adventure” becomes in such persons a ruling\npassion.  “I believe,” says General Skobeleff, “that my bravery\nis simply the passion and at the same time the contempt of\ndanger.  The risk of life fills me with an exaggerated rapture.\nThe fewer there are to share it, the more I like it.  The\nparticipation of my body in the event is required to furnish me\nan adequate excitement.  Everything intellectual appears to me to\nbe reflex; but a meeting of man to man, a duel, a danger into\nwhich I can throw myself headforemost, attracts me, moves me,\nintoxicates me.  I am crazy for it, I love it, I adore it.  I run\nafter danger as one runs after women; I wish it never to stop.\nWere it always the same, it would always bring me a new pleasure.",
        "When I throw myself into an adventure in which I hope to find it,\nmy heart palpitates with the uncertainty; I could wish at once to\nhave it appear and yet to delay.  A sort of painful and delicious\nshiver shakes me; my entire nature runs to meet the peril with an\nimpetus that my will would in vain try to resist. (Juliette Adam: \nLe General Skobeleff, Nouvelle Revue, 1886, abridged.) Skobeleff\nseems to have been a cruel egoist; but the disinterested\nGaribaldi, if one may judge by his “Memorie,” lived in an\nunflagging emotion of similar danger-seeking excitement.",
        "The difference between willing and merely wishing, between having\nideals that are creative and ideals that are but pinings and\nregrets, thus depends solely either on the amount of\nsteam-pressure chronically driving the character in the ideal\ndirection, or on the amount of ideal excitement transiently\nacquired.  Given a certain amount of love, indignation,\ngenerosity, magnanimity, admiration, loyalty, or enthusiasm of\nself-surrender, the result is always the same.  That whole raft\nof cowardly obstructions, which in tame persons and dull moods\nare sovereign impediments to action, sinks away at once.  Our\nconventionality,[147] our shyness, laziness, and stinginess, our\ndemands for precedent and permission, for guarantee and surety,\nour small suspicions, timidities, despairs, where are they now? \nSevered like cobwebs, broken like bubbles in the sun–",
        "     “Wo sind die Sorge nun und Noth\n      Die mich noch gestern wollt’ erschlaffen?\n      Ich scham’ mich dess’ im Morgenroth.”",
        "The flood we are borne on rolls them so lightly under that their\nvery contact is unfelt.  Set free of them, we float and soar and\nsing.  This auroral openness and uplift gives to all creative\nideal levels a bright and caroling quality, which is nowhere more\nmarked than where the controlling emotion is religious.  “The\ntrue monk,” writes an Italian mystic, “takes nothing with him but\nhis lyre.”",
        "[147] See the case on p. 69, above, where the writer describes\nhis experiences of communion with the Divine as consisting\n\"merely in the TEMPORARY OBLITERATION OF THE CONVENTIONALITIES\nwhich usually cover my life.”",
        "We may now turn from these psychological generalities to those\nfruits of the religious state which form the special subject of\nour present lecture.  The man who lives in his religious centre\nof personal energy, and is actuated by spiritual enthusiasms,\ndiffers from his previous carnal self in perfectly definite ways.",
        "The new ardor which burns in his breast consumes in its glow the\nlower “noes” which formerly beset him, and keeps him immune\nagainst infection from the entire groveling portion of his\nnature.  Magnanimities once impossible are now easy; paltry\nconventionalities and mean incentives once tyrannical hold no\nsway.  The stone wall inside of him has fallen, the hardness in\nhis heart has broken down.  The rest of us can, I think, imagine\nthis by recalling our state of feeling in those temporary\n\"melting moods” into which either the trials of real life, or the\ntheatre, or a novel sometimes throws us.  Especially if we weep! \nFor it is then as if our tears broke through an inveterate inner\ndam, and let all sorts of ancient peccancies and moral\nstagnancies drain away, leaving us now washed and soft of heart\nand open to every nobler leading.  With most of us the customary\nhardness quickly returns, but not so with saintly persons.  Many\nsaints, even as energetic ones as Teresa and Loyola, have\npossessed what the church traditionally reveres as a special\ngrace, the so-called gift of tears.  In these persons the melting\nmood seems to have held almost uninterrupted control.  And as it\nis with tears and melting moods, so it is with other exalted\naffections.  Their reign may come by gradual growth or by a\ncrisis; but in either case it may have “come to stay.”",
        "At the end of the last lecture we saw this permanence to be true\nof the general paramountcy of the higher insight, even though in\nthe ebbs of emotional excitement meaner motives might temporarily\nprevail and backsliding might occur.  But that lower temptations\nmay remain completely annulled, apart from transient emotion and\nas if by alteration of the man’s habitual nature, is also proved\nby documentary evidence in certain cases.  Before embarking on\nthe general natural history of the regenerate character, let me\nconvince you of this curious fact by one or two examples. The\nmost numerous are those of reformed drunkards.  You recollect the\ncase of Mr. Hadley in the last lecture; the Jerry McAuley Water\nStreet Mission abounds in similar instances.[148]  You also\nremember the graduate of Oxford, converted at three in the\nafternoon, and getting drunk in the hay-field the next day,\nbut after that permanently cured of his appetite.  “From that\nhour drink has had no terrors for me:  I never touch it, never\nwant it.  The same thing occurred with my pipe. . . . the desire\nfor it went at once and has never returned.  So with every known\nsin, the deliverance in each case being permanent and complete. \nI have had no temptations since conversion.”",
        "[148] Above, p. 200.  “The only radical remedy I know for\ndipsomania is religiomania,” is a saying I have heard quoted from\nsome medical man.",
        "Here is an analogous case from Starbuck’s manuscript\ncollection:–",
        "“I went into the old Adelphi Theatre, where there was a Holiness\nmeeting, . . . and I began saying, ’Lord, Lord, I must have this\nblessing.’  Then what was to me an audible voice said:  ’Are you\nwilling to give up everything to the Lord?’ and question after\nquestion kept coming up, to all of which I said:  ’Yes, Lord;\nyes, Lord!’ until this came:  ’Why do you not accept it NOW?’ and\nI said:  ’I do, Lord.’–I felt no particular joy, only a trust. \nJust then the meeting closed, and, as I went out on the street, I\nmet a gentleman smoking a fine cigar, and a cloud of smoke came\ninto my face, and I took a long, deep breath of it, and praise\nthe Lord, all my appetite for it was gone.  Then as I walked\nalong the street, passing saloons where the fumes of liquor came\nout, I found that all my taste and longing for that accursed\nstuff was gone.  Glory to God! . . . [But] for ten or eleven long\nyears [after that] I was in the wilderness with its ups and\ndowns.  My appetite for liquor never came back.”",
        "The classic case of Colonel Gardiner is that of a man cured of\nsexual temptation in a single hour.  To Mr. Spears the colonel\nsaid, “I was effectually cured of all inclination to that sin I\nwas so strongly addicted to that I thought nothing but shooting\nme through the head could have cured me of it; and all desire and\ninclination to it was removed, as entirely as if I had been a\nsucking child; nor did the temptation return to this day.”  Mr.\nWebster’s words on the same subject are these:  “One thing I have\nheard the colonel frequently say, that he was much addicted to\nimpurity before his acquaintance with religion; but that, so soon\nas he was enlightened from above, he felt the power of the Holy\nGhost changing his nature so wonderfully that his sanctification\nin this respect seemed more remarkable than in any other.\"[149]",
        "[149] Doddridge’s Life of Colonel James Gardiner, London\nReligious Tract Society, pp. 23-32.",
        "Such rapid abolition of ancient impulses and propensities reminds\nus so strongly of what has been observed as the result of\nhypnotic suggestion that it is difficult not to believe that\nsubliminal influences play the decisive part in these abrupt\nchanges of heart, just as they do in hypnotism.[150] Suggestive\ntherapeutics abound in records of cure, after a few sittings, of\ninveterate bad habits with which the patient, left to ordinary\nmoral and physical influences, had struggled in vain.  Both\ndrunkenness and sexual vice have been cured in this way, action\nthrough the subliminal seeming thus in many individuals to have\nthe prerogative of inducing relatively stable change.  If the\ngrace of God miraculously operates, it probably operates through\nthe subliminal door, then.  But just HOW anything operates in\nthis region is still unexplained, and we shall do well now to say\ngood-by to the PROCESS of transformation altogether–leaving it,\nif you like, a good deal of a psychological or theological\nmystery–and to turn our attention to the fruits of the religious\ncondition, no matter in what way they may have been\nproduced.[151]",
        "[150] Here, for example, is a case, from Starbuck’s book, in\nwhich a “sensory automatism” brought about quickly what prayers\nand resolves had been unable to effect.  The subject is a woman. \nShe writes:–",
        "“When I was about forty I tried to quit smoking, but the desire\nwas on me, and had me in its power.  I cried and prayed and\npromised God to quit, but could not.  I had smoked for fifteen\nyears.  When I was fifty-three, as I sat by the fire one day\nsmoking, a voice came to me.  I did not hear it with my ears, but\nmore as a dream or sort of double think.  It said, ’Louisa, lay\ndown smoking.’  At once I replied. ’Will you take the desire\naway?’ But it only kept saying:  ’Louisa, lay down smoking.’ \nThen I got up, laid my pipe on the mantel-shelf, and never smoked\nagain or had any desire to.  The desire was gone as though I had\nnever known it or touched tobacco.  The sight of others smoking\nand the smell of smoke never gave me the least wish to touch it\nagain.”    The Psychology of Religion, p. 142.",
        "[151] Professor Starbuck expresses the radical destruction of old\ninfluences physiologically, as a cutting off of the connection\nbetween higher and lower cerebral centres.  “This condition,” he\nsays, “in which the association-centres connected with the\nspiritual life are cut off from the lower, is often reflected in\nthe way correspondents describe their experiences. . . .  For\nexample:  ’Temptations from without still assail me, but there is\nnothing WITHIN to respond to them.’ The ego [here] is wholly\nidentified with the higher centres whose quality of feeling is\nthat of withinness.  Another of the respondents says:  ’Since\nthen, although Satan tempts me, there is as it were a wall of\nbrass around me, so that his darts cannot touch me.’\"\n–Unquestionably, functional exclusions of this sort must occur\nin the cerebral organ.  But on the side accessible to\nintrospection, their causal condition is nothing but the degree\nof spiritual excitement, getting at last so high and strong as to\nbe sovereign, and it must be frankly confessed that we do not\nknow just why or how such sovereignty comes about in one person\nand not in another.  We can only give our imagination a certain\ndelusive help by mechanical analogies.",
        "If we should conceive, for example, that the human mind, with its\ndifferent possibilities of equilibrium, might be like a\nmany-sided solid with different surfaces on which it could lie\nflat, we might liken mental revolutions to the spatial\nrevolutions of such a body.  As it is pried up, say by a lever,\nfrom a position in which it lies on surface A, for instance, it\nwill linger for a time unstably halfway up, and if the lever\ncease to urge it, it will tumble back or “relapse” under the\ncontinued pull of gravity.  But if at last it rotate far enough\nfor its centre of gravity to pass beyond surface A altogether,\nthe body will fall over, on surface B, say, and abide there\npermanently.  The pulls of gravity towards A have vanished, and\nmay now be disregarded. The polyhedron has become immune against\nfarther attraction from their direction.",
        "In this figure of speech the lever may correspond to the\nemotional influences making for a new life, and the initial pull\nof gravity to the ancient drawbacks and inhibitions.  So long as\nthe emotional influence fails to reach a certain pitch of\nefficacy, the changes it produces are unstable, and the man\nrelapses into his original attitude. But when a certain intensity\nis attained by the new emotion, a critical point is passed, and\nthere then ensues an irreversible revolution, equivalent to the\nproduction of a new nature.",
        "The collective name for the ripe fruits of religion in a\ncharacter is Saintliness.[152] The saintly character is the\ncharacter for which spiritual emotions are the habitual centre of\nthe personal energy; and there is a certain composite photograph\nof universal saintliness, the same in all religions, of which the\nfeatures can easily be traced.[153]",
        "[152] I use this word in spite of a certain flavor of\n\"sanctimoniousness” which sometimes clings to it, because no\nother word suggests as well the exact combination of affections\nwhich the text goes on to describe.",
        "[153] “It will be found,” says Dr. W. R. Inge (in his lectures on\nChristian Mysticism, London, 1899, p. 326), “that men of\npreeminent saintliness agree very closely in what they tell us. \nThey tell us that they have arrived at an unshakable conviction,\nnot based on inference but on immediate experience, that God is a\nspirit with whom the human spirit can hold intercourse; that in\nhim meet all that they can imagine of goodness, truth, and\nbeauty; that they can see his footprints everywhere in nature,\nand feel his presence within them as the very life of their life,\nso that in proportion as they come to themselves they come to\nhim.  They tell us what separates us from him and from happiness\nis, first, self-seeking in all its forms; and secondly,\nsensuality in all its forms; that these are the ways of darkness\nand death, which hide from us the face of God; while the path of\nthe just is like a shining light, which shineth more and more\nunto the perfect day.”",
        "They are these:–",
        "1.  A feeling of being in a wider life than that of this world’s\nselfish little interests; and a conviction, not merely\nintellectual, but as it were sensible, of the existence of an\nIdeal Power.  In Christian saintliness this power is always\npersonified as God; but abstract moral ideals, civic or patriotic\nutopias, or inner versions of holiness or right may also be felt\nas the true lords and enlargers of our life, in ways which I\ndescribed in the lecture on the Reality of the Unseen.[154]",
        "[154] The “enthusiasm of humanity” may lead to a life which\ncoalesces in many respects with that of Christian saintliness. \nTake the following rules proposed to members of the Union pour\nl’Action morale, in the Bulletin de l’Union, April 1-15, 1894. \nSee, also, Revue Bleue, August 13, 1892.",
        "“We would make known in our own persons the usefulness of rule,\nof discipline, of resignation and renunciation; we would teach\nthe necessary perpetuity of suffering, and explain the creative\npart which it plays.  We would wage war upon false optimism; on\nthe base hope of happiness coming to us ready made; on the notion\nof a salvation by knowledge alone, or by material civilization\nalone, vain symbol as this is of civilization, precarious\nexternal arrangement ill-fitted to replace the intimate union and\nconsent of souls.  We would wage war also on bad morals, whether\nin public or in private life; on luxury, fastidiousness, and\nover-refinement, on all that tends to increase the painful,\nimmoral, and anti-social multiplications of our wants; on all\nthat excites envy and dislike in the soul of the common people,\nand confirms the notion that the chief end of life is freedom to\nenjoy.  We would preach by our example the respect of superiors\nand equals, the respect of all men; affectionate simplicity in\nour relations with inferiors and insignificant persons;\nindulgence where our own claims only are concerned, but firmness\nin our demands where they relate to duties towards others or\ntowards the public.",
        "“For the common people are what we help them to become; their\nvices are our vices, gazed upon, envied, and imitated; and if\nthey come back with all their weight upon us, it is but just.",
        "2.  A sense of the friendly continuity of the ideal power with\nour own life, and a willing self-surrender to its control.",

        "a.  Asceticism.–The self-surrender may become so passionate as\nto turn into self-immolation.  It may then so over-rule the\nordinary inhibitions of the flesh that the saint finds positive\npleasure in sacrifice and asceticism, measuring and expressing as\nthey do the degree of his loyalty to the higher power.",
        "b.  Strength of Soul.–The sense of enlargement of life may be so\nuplifting that personal motives and inhibitions, commonly\nomnipotent, become too insignificant for notice, and new reaches\nof patience and fortitude open out.  Fears and anxieties go, and\nblissful equanimity takes their place. Come heaven, come hell, it\nmakes no difference now!",

        "c.  Purity.–The shifting of the emotional centre brings with it,\nfirst, increase of purity.  The sensitiveness to spiritual\ndiscords is enhanced, and the cleansing of existence from brutal\nand sensual elements becomes imperative.  Occasions of contact\nwith such elements are avoided:  the saintly life must deepen its\nspiritual consistency and keep unspotted from the world.  In some\ntemperaments this need of purity of spirit takes an ascetic turn,\nand weaknesses of the flesh are treated with relentless severity.",
        "d.  Charity.–The shifting of the emotional centre brings,\nsecondly, increase of charity, tenderness for fellow-creatures.\nThe ordinary motives to antipathy, which usually set such close\nbounds to tenderness among human beings, are inhibited.

It drives away all fear\nof what may befall them.  That nearness of God is a constant\nsecurity against terror and anxiety.  It is not that they are at\nall assured of physical safety, or deem themselves protected by a\nlove which is denied to others, but that they are in a state of\nmind equally ready to be safe or to meet with injury.  If injury\nbefall them, they will be content to bear it because the Lord is\ntheir keeper, and nothing can befall them without his will.  If\nit be his will, then injury is for them a blessing and no\ncalamity at all.  Thus and thus only is the trustful man\nprotected and shielded from harm.  And I for one–by no means a\nthick-skinned or hard-nerved man-am absolutely satisfied with\nthis arrangement, and do not wish for any other kind of immunity\nfrom danger and catastrophe.  Quite as sensitive to pain as the\nmost highly strung organism, I yet feel that the worst of it is\nconquered, and the sting taken out of it altogether, by the\nthought that God is our loving and sleepless keeper, and that\nnothing can hurt us without his will.\"[158]",

        "More excited expressions of this condition are abundant in\nreligious literature.  I could easily weary you with their\nmonotony. Here is an account from Mrs. Jonathan Edwards:–",
        "“Last night,” Mrs. Edwards writes, “was the sweetest night I\never had in my life.  I never before, for so long a time\ntogether, enjoyed so much of the light and rest and sweetness of\nheaven in my soul, but without the least agitation of body during\nthe whole time.  Part of the night I lay awake, sometimes asleep,\nand sometimes between sleeping and waking.  But all night I\ncontinued in a constant, clear, and lively sense of the heavenly\nsweetness of Christ’s excellent love, of his nearness to me, and\nof my dearness to him; with an inexpressibly sweet calmness of\nsoul in an entire rest in him.  I seemed to myself to perceive a\nglow of divine love come down from the heart of Christ in heaven\ninto my heart in a constant stream, like a stream or pencil of\nsweet light.  At the same time my heart and soul all flowed out\nin love to Christ, so that there seemed to be a constant flowing\nand reflowing of heavenly love, and I appeared to myself to float\nor swim, in these bright, sweet beams, like the motes swimming in\nthe beams of the sun, or the streams of his light which come in\nat the window.  I think that what I felt each minute was worth\nmore than all the outward comfort and pleasure which I had\nenjoyed in my whole life put together.  It was pleasure, without\nthe least sting, or any interruption.  It was a sweetness, which\nmy soul was lost in; it seemed to be all that my feeble frame\ncould sustain.  There was but little difference, whether I was\nasleep or awake, but if there was any difference, the sweetness\nwas greatest while I was asleep.[159]  As I awoke early the next\nmorning, it seemed to me that I had entirely done with myself.  I\nfelt that the opinions of the world concerning me were nothing,\nand that I had no more to do with any outward interest of my own\nthan with that of a person whom I never saw. The glory of God\nseemed to swallow up every wish and desire of my heart. . . .\nAfter retiring to rest and sleeping a little while, I awoke, and\nwas led to reflect on God’s mercy to me, in giving me, for many\nyears, a willingness to die; and after that, in making me willing\nto live, that I might do and suffer whatever he called me to\nhere.  I also thought how God had graciously given me an entire\nresignation to his will, with respect to the kind and manner of\ndeath that I should die; having been made willing to die on the\nrack, or at the stake, and if it were God’s will, to die in\ndarkness.  But now it occurred to me, I used to think of living\nno longer than to the ordinary age of man.  Upon this I was led\nto ask myself, whether I was not willing to be kept out of heaven\neven longer; and my whole heart seemed immediately to reply: \nYes, a thousand years, and a thousand in horror, if it be most\nfor the honor of God, the torment of my body being so great,\nawful, and overwhelming that none could bear to live in the\ncountry where the spectacle was seen, and the torment of my mind\nbeing vastly greater.  And it seemed to me that I found a perfect\nwillingness, quietness, and alacrity of soul in consenting that\nit should be so, if it were most for the glory of God, so that\nthere was no hesitation, doubt, or darkness in my mind.  The\nglory of God seemed to overcome me and swallow me up, and every\nconceivable suffering, and everything that was terrible to my\nnature, seemed to shrink to nothing before it.  This resignation\ncontinued in its clearness and brightness the rest of the night,\nand all the next day, and the night following, and on Monday in\nthe forenoon, without interruption or abatement.\"[160]",
        "[159] Compare Madame Guyon:  “It was my practice to arise at\nmidnight for purposes of devotion. . . . It seemed to me that\nGod came at the precise time and woke me from sleep in order that\nI might enjoy him.  When I was out of health or greatly fatigued,\nhe did not awake me, but at such times I felt, even in my sleep,\na singular possession of God.  He loved me so much that he seemed\nto pervade my being, at a time when I could be only imperfectly\nconscious of his presence.  My sleep is sometimes broken–a sort\nof half sleep; but my soul seems to be awake enough to know God,\nwhen it is hardly capable of knowing anything else.”  T.

        "The annals of Catholic saintship abound in records as ecstatic or\nmore ecstatic than this.  “Often the assaults of the divine\nlove,” it is said of the Sister Seraphique de la Martiniere,\n\"reduced her almost to the point of death.  She used tenderly to\ncomplain of this to God.  ’I cannot support it,’ she used to say.",

        "Let me pass next to the Charity and Brotherly Love which are a\nusual fruit of saintliness, and have always been reckoned\nessential theological virtues, however limited may have been the\nkinds of service which the particular theology enjoined.\nBrotherly love would follow logically from the assurance of God’s\nfriendly presence, the notion of our brotherhood as men being an\nimmediate inference from that of God’s fatherhood of us all. \nWhen Christ utters the precepts:  “Love your enemies, bless them\nthat curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them\nwhich despitefully use you, and persecute you,” he gives for a\nreason:  “That ye may be the children of your Father which is in\nheaven:  for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the\ngood, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.”  One\nmight therefore be tempted to explain both the humility as to\none’s self and the charity towards others which characterize\nspiritual excitement, as results of the all-leveling character of\ntheistic belief.  But these affections are certainly not mere\nderivatives of theism.  We find them in Stoicism, in Hinduism,\nand in Buddhism in the highest possible degree. They HARMONIZE\nwith paternal theism beautifully; but they harmonize with all\nreflection whatever upon the dependence of mankind on general\ncauses; and we must, I think, consider them not subordinate but\ncoordinate parts of that great complex excitement in the study of\nwhich we are engaged. Religious rapture, moral enthusiasm,\nontological wonder, cosmic emotion, are all unifying states of\nmind, in which the sand and grit of the selfhood incline to\ndisappear, and tenderness to rule.  The best thing is to describe\nthe condition integrally as a characteristic affection to which\nour nature is liable, a region in which we find ourselves at\nhome, a sea in which we swim; but not to pretend to explain its\nparts by deriving them too cleverly from one another.  Like love\nor fear, the faith-state is a natural psychic complex, and\ncarries charity with it by organic consequence.  Jubilation is an\nexpansive affection, and all expansive affections are\nself-forgetful and kindly so long as they endure.",
        "We find this the case even when they are pathological in origin. \nIn his instructive work, la Tristesse et la Joie,[162] M. Georges\nDumas compares together the melancholy and the joyous phase of\ncircular insanity, and shows that, while selfishness\ncharacterizes the one, the other is marked by altruistic\nimpulses.  No human being so stingy and useless as was Marie in\nher melancholy period!  But the moment the happy period begins,\n\"sympathy and kindness become her characteristic sentiments.  She\ndisplays a universal goodwill, not only of intention, but in act.\n. . .  She becomes solicitous of the health of other patients,\ninterested in getting them out, desirous to procure wool to knit\nsocks for some of them. Never since she has been under my\nobservation have I heard her in her joyous period utter any but\ncharitable opinions.\"[163]  And later, Dr. Dumas says of all such\njoyous conditions that “unselfish sentiments and tender emotions\nare the only affective states to be found in them.  The subject’s\nmind is closed against envy, hatred, and vindictiveness, and\nwholly transformed into benevolence, indulgence, and mercy.\"[164]",

        "There is thus an organic affinity between joyousness and\ntenderness, and their companionship in the saintly life need in\nno way occasion surprise.  Along with the happiness, this\nincrease of tenderness is often noted in narratives of\nconversion. “I began to work for others\";–\"I had more tender\nfeeling for my family and friends\";–\"I spoke at once to a person\nwith whom I had been angry\";–\"I felt for every one, and loved my\nfriends better\";–\"I felt every one to be my friend\";–these are\nso many expressions from the records collected by Professor\nStarbuck.[165]",

        "“When,” says Mrs. Edwards, continuing the narrative from which I\nmade quotation a moment ago, “I arose on the morning of the\nSabbath, I felt a love to all mankind, wholly peculiar in its\nstrength and sweetness, far beyond all that I had ever felt\nbefore.  The power of that love seemed inexpressible.  I thought,\nif I were surrounded by enemies, who were venting their malice\nand cruelty upon me, in tormenting me, it would still be\nimpossible that I should cherish any feelings towards them but\nthose of love, and pity, and ardent desires for their happiness. \nI never before felt so far from a disposition to judge and\ncensure others, as I did that morning.  I realized also, in an\nunusual and very lively manner, how great a part of Christianity\nlies in the performance of our social and relative duties to one\nanother.  The same joyful sense continued throughout the day–a\nsweet love to God and all mankind.”",

        "[166] The barrier between men and animals also.  We read of\nTowianski, an eminent Polish patriot and mystic, that “one day\none of his friends met him in the rain, caressing a big dog which\nwas jumping upon him and covering him horribly with mud.  On\nbeing asked why he permitted the animal thus to dirty his\nclothes, Towianski replied:  ’This dog, whom I am now meeting for\nthe first time, has shown a great fellow-feeling for me, and a\ngreat joy in my recognition and acceptance of his greetings. \nWere I to drive him off, I should wound his feelings and do him a\nmoral injury.  It would be an offense not only to him, but to all\nthe spirits of the other world who are on the same level with\nhim.  The damage which he does to my coat is as nothing in\ncomparison with the wrong which I should inflict upon him, in\ncase I were to remain indifferent to the manifestations of his\nfriendship.

Yet it makes one ask the\nquestion:  Can there in general be a level of emotion so\nunifying, so obliterative of differences between man and man,\nthat even enmity may come to be an irrelevant circumstance and\nfail to inhibit the friendlier interests aroused?  If positive\nwell-wishing could attain so supreme a degree of excitement,\nthose who were swayed by it might well seem superhuman beings. \nTheir life would be morally discrete from the life of other men,\nand there is no saying, in the absence of positive experience of\nan authentic kind–for there are few active examples in our\nscriptures, and the Buddhistic examples are legendary,[168]–what\nthe effects might be:  they might conceivably transform the\nworld.",

Religious\nemotion makes us feel that other kingdom to be close at hand,\nwithin our reach.",
        "The inhibition of instinctive repugnance is proved not only by\nthe showing of love to enemies, but by the showing of it to any\none who is personally loathsome.  In the annals of saintliness we\nfind a curious mixture of motives impelling in this direction. \nAsceticism plays its part; and along with charity pure and\nsimple, we find humility or the desire to disclaim distinction\nand to grovel on the common level before God.  Certainly all\nthree principles were at work when Francis of Assisi and Ignatius\nLoyola exchanged their garments with those of filthy beggars. \nAll three are at work when religious persons consecrate their\nlives to the care of leprosy or other peculiarly unpleasant\ndiseases.  The nursing of the sick is a function to which the\nreligious seem strongly drawn, even apart from the fact that\nchurch traditions set that way.  But in the annals of this sort\nof charity we find fantastic excesses of devotion recorded which\nare only explicable by the frenzy of self-immolation\nsimultaneously aroused.  Francis of Assisi kisses his lepers;\nMargaret Mary Alacoque, Francis Xavier, St.  John of God, and\nothers are said to have cleansed the sores and ulcers of their\npatients with their respective tongues; and the lives of such\nsaints as Elizabeth of Hungary and Madame de Chantal are full of\na sort of reveling in hospital purulence, disagreeable to read\nof, and which makes us admire and shudder at the same time.",

        "“A paradise of inward tranquillity” seems to be faith’s usual\nresult; and it is easy, even without being religious one’s self,\nto understand this.  A moment back, in treating of the sense of\nGod’s presence, I spoke of the unaccountable feeling of safety\nwhich one may then have.  And, indeed, how can it possibly fail\nto steady the nerves, to cool the fever, and appease the fret, if\none be sensibly conscious that, no matter what one’s difficulties\nfor the moment may appear to be, one’s life as a whole is in the\nkeeping of a power whom one can absolutely trust?  In deeply\nreligious men the abandonment of self to this power is\npassionate.  Whoever not only says, but FEELS, “God’s will be\ndone,” is mailed against every weakness; and the whole historic\narray of martyrs, missionaries, and religious reformers is there\nto prove the tranquil-mindedness, under naturally agitating or\ndistressing circumstances, which self-surrender brings.",
        "The temper of the tranquil-mindedness differs, of course,\naccording as the person is of a constitutionally sombre or of a\nconstitutionally cheerful cast of mind.  In the sombre it\npartakes more of resignation and submission; in the cheerful it\nis a joyous consent.

The carriage sank in the quicksand. Others\nwho were with us threw themselves out in excessive fright.  But I\nfound my thoughts so much taken up with God that I had no\ndistinct sense of danger.  It is true that the thought of being\ndrowned passed across my mind, but it cost no other sensation or\nreflection in me than this–that I felt quite contented and\nwilling it were so, if it were my heavenly Father’s choice.” \nSailing from Nice to Genoa, a storm keeps her eleven days at sea.",

        "The transition from tenseness, self-responsibility, and worry, to\nequanimity, receptivity, and peace, is the most wonderful of all\nthose shiftings of inner equilibrium, those changes of the\npersonal centre of energy, which I have analyzed so often; and\nthe chief wonder of it is that it so often comes about, not by\ndoing, but by simply relaxing and throwing the burden down.  This\nabandonment of self-responsibility seems to be the fundamental\nact in specifically religious, as distinguished from moral\npractice.  It antedates theologies and is independent of\nphilosophies.  Mind-cure, theosophy, stoicism, ordinary\nneurological hygiene, insist on it as emphatically as\nChristianity does, and it is capable of entering into closest\nmarriage with every speculative creed.[174]  Christians who have\nit strongly live in what is called “recollection,” and are never\nanxious about the future, nor worry over the outcome of the day. \nOf Saint Catharine of Genoa it is said that “she took cognizance\nof things, only as they were presented to her in succession,\nMOMENT BY MOMENT.”  To her holy soul, “the divine moment was the\npresent moment, . . . and when the present moment was estimated\nin itself and in its relations, and when the duty that was\ninvolved in it was accomplished, it was permitted to pass away as\nif it had never been, and to give way to the facts and duties of\nthe moment which came after.\"[175]  Hinduism, mind-cure, and\ntheosophy all lay great emphasis upon this concentration of the\nconsciousness upon the moment at hand.",

        "The next religious symptom which I will note is what have called\nPurity of Life.  The saintly person becomes exceedingly sensitive\nto inner inconsistency or discord, and mixture and confusion grow\nintolerable.  All the mind’s objects and occupations must be\nordered with reference to the special spiritual excitement which\nis now its keynote.  Whatever is unspiritual taints the pure\nwater of the soul and is repugnant.  Mixed with this exaltation\nof the moral sensibilities there is also an ardor of sacrifice,\nfor the beloved deity’s sake, of everything unworthy of him. \nSometimes the spiritual ardor is so sovereign that purity is\nachieved at a stroke –we have seen examples.  Usually it is a\nmore gradual conquest.  Billy Bray’s account of his abandonment\nof tobacco is a good example of the latter form of achievement.",
        "“I had been a smoker as well as a drunkard, and I used to love my\ntobacco as much as I loved my meat, and I would rather go down\ninto the mine without my dinner than without my pipe.  In the\ndays of old, the Lord spoke by the mouths of his servants, the\nprophets; now he speaks to us by the spirit of his Son.  I had\nnot only the feeling part of religion, but I could hear the\nsmall, still voice within speaking to me.  When I took the pipe\nto smoke, it would be applied within, ’It is an idol, a lust;\nworship the Lord with clean lips.’  So, I felt it was not right\nto smoke.  The Lord also sent a woman to convince me.  I was one\nday in a house, and I took out my pipe to light it at the fire,\nand Mary Hawke–for that was the woman’s name–said, ’Do you not\nfeel it is wrong to smoke?’  I said that I felt something inside\ntelling me that it was an idol, a lust, and she said that was the\nLord.  Then I said, ’Now, I must give it up, for the Lord is\ntelling me of it inside, and the woman outside, so the tobacco\nmust go, love it as I may.’  There and then I took the tobacco\nout of my pocket, and threw it into the fire, and put the pipe\nunder my foot, ’ashes to ashes, dust to dust.’  And I have not\nsmoked since.  I found it hard to break off old habits, but I\ncried to the Lord for help, and he gave me strength, for he has\nsaid, ’Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver\nthee.’  The day after I gave up smoking I had the toothache so\nbad that I did not know what to do.  I thought this was owing to\ngiving up the pipe, but I said I would never smoke again, if I\nlost every tooth in my head.  I said, ’Lord, thou hast told us My\nyoke is easy and my burden is light,’ and when I said that, all\nthe pain left me.  Sometimes the thought of the pipe would come\nback to me very strong; but the Lord strengthened me against the\nhabit, and, bless his name, I have not smoked since.”",
        "Bray’s biographer writes that after he had given up smoking, he\nthought that he would chew a little, but he conquered this dirty\nhabit, too.  “On one occasion,” Bray said, “when at a prayer-\nmeeting at Hicks Mill, I heard the Lord say to me, ’Worship me\nwith clean lips.’  So, when we got up from our knees, I took the\nquid out of my mouth and ’whipped ’en’ [threw it] under the form.",
        "But, when we got on our knees again, I put another quid into my\nmouth.  Then the Lord said to me again, ’Worship me with clean\nlips.’  So I took the quid out of my mouth, and whipped ’en under\nthe form again, and said, ’Yes, Lord, I will.’  From that time I\ngave up chewing as well as smoking, and have been a free man.”",
        "The ascetic forms which the impulse for veracity and purity of\nlife may take are often pathetic enough.  The early Quakers, for\nexample, had hard battles to wage against the worldliness and\ninsincerity of the ecclesiastical Christianity of their time. \nYet the battle that cost them most wounds was probably that which\nthey fought in defense of their own right to social veracity and\nsincerity in their thee-ing and thou-ing, in not doffing the hat\nor giving titles of respect. It was laid on George Fox that these\nconventional customs were a lie and a sham, and the whole body of\nhis followers thereupon renounced them, as a sacrifice to truth,\nand so that their acts and the spirit they professed might be\nmore in accord.",
        "“When the Lord sent me into the world,” says Fox in his Journal,\n\"he forbade me to put off my hat to any, high or low: and I was\nrequired to ’thee’ and ’thou’ all men and women, without any\nrespect to rich or poor, great or small.  And as I traveled up\nand down, I was not to bid people Good-morning or Good-evening,\nneither might I bow or scrape with my leg to any one.  This made\nthe sects and professions rage.  Oh! the rage that was in the\npriests, magistrates, professors, and people of all sorts:  and\nespecially in priests and professors:  for though ’thou’ to a\nsingle person was according to their accidence and grammar rules,\nand according to the Bible, yet they could not bear to hear it: \nand because I could not put off my hat to them, it set them all\ninto a rage. . . . Oh! the scorn, heat, and fury that arose!  Oh!\nthe blows, punchings, beatings, and imprisonments that we\nunderwent for not putting off our hats to men!  Some had their\nhats violently plucked off and thrown away, so that they quite\nlost them.  The bad language and evil usage we received on this\naccount is hard to be expressed, besides the danger we were\nsometimes in of losing our lives for this matter, and that by the\ngreat professors of Christianity, who thereby discovered they\nwere not true believers.  And though it was but a small thing in\nthe eye of man, yet a wonderful confusion it brought among all\nprofessors and priests:  but, blessed be the Lord, many came to\nsee the vanity of that custom of putting off hats to men, and\nfelt the weight of Truth’s testimony against it.”",
        "In the autobiography of Thomas Elwood, an early Quaker, who at\none time was secretary to John Milton, we find an exquisitely\nquaint and candid account of the trials he underwent both at home\nand abroad, in following Fox’s canons of sincerity.  The\nanecdotes are too lengthy for citation; but Elwood sets down his\nmanner of feeling about these things in a shorter passage, which\nI will quote as a characteristic utterance of spiritual\nsensibility:–",
        "“By this divine light, then,” says Elwood, “I saw that though I\nhad not the evil of the common uncleanliness, debauchery,\nprofaneness, and pollutions of the world to put away, because I\nhad, through the great goodness of God and a civil education,\nbeen preserved out of those grosser evils, yet I had many other\nevils to put away and to cease from; some of which were not by\nthe world, which lies in wickedness (I John v. 19), accounted\nevils, but by the light of Christ were made manifest to me to be\nevils, and as such condemned in me.",
        "“As particularly those fruits and effects of pride that discover\nthemselves in the vanity and superfluity of apparel; which I took\ntoo much delight in.  This evil of my doings I was required to\nput away and cease from; and judgment lay upon me till I did so.",
        "“I took off from my apparel those unnecessary trimmings of lace,\nribbons, and useless buttons, which had no real service, but were\nset on only for that which was by mistake called ornament; and I\nceased to wear rings.",
        "“Again, the giving of flattering titles to men between whom and\nme there was not any relation to which such titles could be\npretended to belong.  This was an evil I had been much addicted\nto, and was accounted a ready artist in; therefore this evil also\nwas I required to put away and cease from.  So that thenceforward\nI durst not say, Sir, Master, My Lord, Madam (or My Dame); or say\nYour Servant to any one to whom I did not stand in the real\nrelation of a servant, which I had never done to any.",
        "“Again, respect of persons, in uncovering the head and bowing the\nknee or body in salutation, was a practice I had been much in the\nuse of; and this, being one of the vain customs of the world,\nintroduced by the spirit of the world, instead of the true honor\nwhich this is a false representation of, and used in deceit as a\ntoken of respect by persons one to another, who bear no real\nrespect one to another; and besides this, being a type and a\nproper emblem of that divine honor which all ought to pay to\nAlmighty God, and which all of all sorts, who take upon them the\nChristian name, appear in when they offer their prayers to him,\nand therefore should not be given to men;–I found this to be one\nof those evils which I had been too long doing; therefore I was\nnow required to put it away and cease from it.",
        "“Again, the corrupt and unsound form of speaking in the plural\nnumber to a single person, YOU to one, instead of THOU, contrary\nto the pure, plain, and single language of truth, THOU to one,\nand YOU to more than one, which had always been used by God to\nmen, and men to God, as well as one to another, from the oldest\nrecord of time till corrupt men, for corrupt ends, in later and\ncorrupt times, to flatter, fawn, and work upon the corrupt nature\nin men, brought in that false and senseless way of speaking you\nto one, which has since corrupted the modern languages, and hath\ngreatly debased the spirits and depraved the manners of\nmen;–this evil custom I had been as forward in as others, and\nthis I was now called out of and required to cease from.",
        "“These and many more evil customs which had sprung up in the\nnight of darkness and general apostasy from the truth and true\nreligion were now, by the inshining of this pure ray of divine\nlight in my conscience, gradually discovered to me to be what I\nought to cease from, shun, and stand a witness against.\"[176]",

        "These early Quakers were Puritans indeed.  The slightest\ninconsistency between profession and deed jarred some of them to\nactive protest.  John Woolman writes in his diary:–",
        "“In these journeys I have been where much cloth hath been dyed;\nand have at sundry times walked over ground where much of their\ndyestuffs has drained away.  This hath produced a longing in my\nmind that people might come into cleanness of spirit, cleanness\nof person, and cleanness about their houses and garments.  Dyes\nbeing invented partly to please the eye, and partly to hide dirt,\nI have felt in this weak state, when traveling in dirtiness, and\naffected with unwholesome scents, a strong desire that the nature\nof dyeing cloth to hide dirt may be more fully considered.",
        "“Washing our garments to keep them sweet is cleanly, but it is\nthe opposite to real cleanliness to hide dirt in them.  Through\ngiving way to hiding dirt in our garments a spirit which would\nconceal that which is disagreeable is strengthened.  Real\ncleanliness becometh a holy people; but hiding that which is not\nclean by coloring our garments seems contrary to the sweetness of\nsincerity.  Through some sorts of dyes cloth is rendered less\nuseful. And if the value of dyestuffs, and expense of dyeing, and\nthe damage done to cloth, were all added together, and that cost\napplied to keeping all sweet and clean, how much more would real\ncleanliness prevail.",
        "“Thinking often on these things, the use of hats and garments\ndyed with a dye hurtful to them, and wearing more clothes in\nsummer than are useful, grew more uneasy to me; believing them to\nbe customs which have not their foundation in pure wisdom.  The\napprehension of being singular from my beloved friends was a\nstrait upon me; and thus I continued in the use of some things,\ncontrary to my judgment, about nine months.  Then I thought of\ngetting a hat the natural color of the fur, but the apprehension\nof being looked upon as one affecting singularity felt uneasy to\nme.  On this account I was under close exercise of mind in the\ntime of our general spring meeting in 1762, greatly desiring to\nbe rightly directed; when, being deeply bowed in spirit before\nthe Lord, I was made willing to submit to what I apprehended was\nrequired of me; and when I returned home, got a hat of the\nnatural color of the fur.",
        "“In attending meetings, this singularity was a trial to me, and\nmore especially at this time, as white hats were used by some who\nwere fond of following the changeable modes of dress, and as some\nfriends, who knew not from what motives I wore it, grew shy of\nme, I felt my way for a time shut up in the exercise of the\nministry.  Some friends were apprehensive that my wearing such a\nhat savored of an affected singularity:  those who spoke with me\nin a friendly way, I generally informed in a few words, that I\nbelieved my wearing it was not in my own will.”",
        "When the craving for moral consistency and purity is developed to\nthis degree, the subject may well find the outer world too full\nof shocks to dwell in, and can unify his life and keep his soul\nunspotted only by withdrawing from it. That law which impels the\nartist to achieve harmony in his composition by simply dropping\nout whatever jars, or suggests a discord, rules also in the\nspiritual life.  To omit, says Stevenson, is the one art in\nliterature:  “If I knew how to omit, I should ask no other\nknowledge.”  And life, when full of disorder and slackness and\nvague superfluity, can no more have what we call character than\nliterature can have it under similar conditions.  So monasteries\nand communities of sympathetic devotees open their doors, and in\ntheir changeless order, characterized by omissions quite as much\nas constituted of actions, the holy-minded person finds that\ninner smoothness and cleanness which it is torture to him to feel\nviolated at every turn by the discordancy and brutality of\nsecular existence.",
        "That the scrupulosity of purity may be carried to a fantastic\nextreme must be admitted.  In this it resembles Asceticism, to\nwhich further symptom of saintliness we had better turn next. \nThe adjective “ascetic” is applied to conduct originating on\ndiverse psychological levels, which I might as well begin by\ndistinguishing from one another.",
        "1.  Asceticism may be a mere expression of organic hardihood,\ndisgusted with too much ease.",
        "2.  Temperance in meat and drink, simplicity of apparel,\nchastity, and non-pampering of the body generally, may be fruits\nof the love of purity, shocked by whatever savors of the sensual.",
        "3.  They may also be fruits of love, that is, they may appeal to\nthe subject in the light of sacrifices which he is happy in\nmaking to the Deity whom he acknowledges.",
        "4.  Again, ascetic mortifications and torments may be due to\npessimistic feelings about the self, combined with theological\nbeliefs concerning expiation.  The devotee may feel that he is\nbuying himself free, or escaping worse sufferings hereafter, by\ndoing penance now.",
        "5.  In psychopathic persons, mortifications may be entered on\nirrationally, by a sort of obsession or fixed idea which comes as\na challenge and must be worked off, because only thus does the\nsubject get his interior consciousness feeling right again.",
        "6.  Finally, ascetic exercises may in rarer instances be prompted\nby genuine perversions of the bodily sensibility, in consequence\nof which normally pain-giving stimuli are actually felt as\npleasures.",
        "I will try to give an instance under each of these heads in turn;\nbut it is not easy to get them pure, for in cases pronounced\nenough to be immediately classed as ascetic, several of the\nassigned motives usually work together.  Moreover, before citing\nany examples at all, I must invite you to some general\npsychological considerations which apply to all of them alike.",
        "A strange moral transformation has within the past century swept\nover our Western world.  We no longer think that we are called on\nto face physical pain with equanimity. It is not expected of a\nman that he should either endure it or inflict much of it, and to\nlisten to the recital of cases of it makes our flesh creep\nmorally as well as physically.  The way in which our ancestors\nlooked upon pain as an eternal ingredient of the world’s order,\nand both caused and suffered it as a matter-of-course portion of\ntheir day’s work, fills us with amazement.  We wonder that any\nhuman beings could have been so callous.  The result of this\nhistoric alteration is that even in the Mother Church herself,\nwhere ascetic discipline has such a fixed traditional prestige as\na factor of merit, it has largely come into desuetude, if not\ndiscredit.  A believer who flagellates or “macerates” himself\ntoday arouses more wonder and fear than emulation.  Many Catholic\nwriters who admit that the times have changed in this respect do\nso resignedly; and even add that perhaps it is as well not to\nwaste feelings in regretting the matter, for to return to the\nheroic corporeal discipline of ancient days might be an\nextravagance.",
        "Where to seek the easy and the pleasant seems instinctive\n–and instinctive it appears to be in man; any deliberate\ntendency to pursue the hard and painful as such and for their own\nsakes might well strike one as purely abnormal.  Nevertheless, in\nmoderate degrees it is natural and even usual to human nature to\ncourt the arduous.  It is only the extreme manifestations of the\ntendency that can be regarded as a paradox.",
        "The psychological reasons for this lie near the surface. When we\ndrop abstractions and take what we call our will in the act, we\nsee that it is a very complex function.  It involves both\nstimulations and inhibitions; it follows generalized habits; it\nis escorted by reflective criticisms; and it leaves a good or a\nbad taste of itself behind, according to the manner of the\nperformance.  The result is that, quite apart from the immediate\npleasure which any sensible experience may give us, our own\ngeneral moral attitude in procuring or undergoing the experience\nbrings with it a secondary satisfaction or distaste.  Some men\nand women, indeed, there are who can live on smiles and the word\n\"yes” forever.  But for others (indeed for most), this is too\ntepid and relaxed a moral climate.  Passive happiness is slack\nand insipid, and soon grows mawkish and intolerable.  Some\nausterity and wintry negativity, some roughness, danger,\nstringency, and effort, some “no! no!” must be mixed in, to\nproduce the sense of an existence with character and texture and\npower.  The range of individual differences in this respect is\nenormous; but whatever the mixture of yeses and noes may be, the\nperson is infallibly aware when he has struck it in the right\nproportion FOR HIM.  This, he feels, is  my proper vocation, this\nis the OPTIMUM, the law, the life for me to live.  Here I find\nthe degree of equilibrium, safety, calm, and leisure which I\nneed, or here I find the challenge, passion, fight, and hardship\nwithout which my soul’s energy expires.",
        "Every individual soul, in short, like every individual machine \nor organism, has its own best conditions of efficiency. A given\nmachine will run best under a certain steam-pressure, a certain\namperage; an organism under a certain diet, weight, or exercise. \nYou seem to do best, I heard a doctor say to a patient, at about\n140 millimeters of arterial tension.  And it is just so with our\nsundry souls:  some are happiest in calm weather; some need the\nsense of tension, of strong volition, to make them feel alive and\nwell.  For these latter souls, whatever is gained from day to day\nmust be paid for by sacrifice and inhibition, or else it comes\ntoo cheap and has no zest.",
        "Now when characters of this latter sort become religious, they\nare apt to turn the edge of their need of effort and negativity\nagainst their natural self; and the ascetic life gets evolved as\na consequence.",
        "When Professor Tyndall in one of his lectures tells us that\nThomas Carlyle put him into his bath-tub every morning of a\nfreezing Berlin winter, he proclaimed one of the lowest grades of\nasceticism.  Even without Carlyle, most of us find it necessary\nto our soul’s health to start the day with a rather cool\nimmersion.  A little farther along the scale we get such\nstatements as this, from one of my correspondents, an agnostic:–",
        "“Often at night in my warm bed I would feel ashamed to depend so\non the warmth, and whenever the thought would come over me I\nwould have to get up, no matter what time of night it was, and\nstand for a minute in the cold, just so as to prove my manhood.”",
        "Such cases as these belong simply to our head 1.  In the next\ncase we probably have a mixture of heads 2 and 3– the asceticism\nbecomes far more systematic and pronounced.  The writer is a\nProtestant, whose sense of moral energy could doubtless be\ngratified on no lower terms, and I take his case from Starbuck’s\nmanuscript collection.",
        "“I practiced fasting and mortification of the flesh.  I secretly\nmade burlap shirts, and put the burrs next the skin, and wore\npebbles in my shoes.  I would spend nights flat on my back on the\nfloor without any covering.”",
        "The Roman Church has organized and codified all this sort of\nthing, and given it a market-value in the shape of “merit.”   \nBut we see the cultivation of hardship cropping out under every\nsky and in every faith, as a spontaneous need of character.  Thus\nwe read of Channing, when first settled as a Unitarian minister,\nthat–",
        "“He was now more simple than ever, and seemed to have become\nincapable of any form of self-indulgence.  He took the smallest\nroom in the house for his study, though he might easily have\ncommanded one more light, airy, and in every way more suitable;\nand chose for his sleeping chamber an attic which he shared with\na younger brother.  The furniture of the latter might have\nanswered for the cell of an anchorite, and consisted of a hard\nmattress on a cot-bedstead, plain wooden chairs and table, with\nmatting on the floor.  It was without fire, and to cold he was\nthroughout life extremely sensitive; but he never complained or\nappeared in any way to be conscious of inconvenience.  ’I\nrecollect,’ says his brother, ’after one most severe night, that\nin the morning he sportively thus alluded to his suffering:  “If\nmy bed were my country, I should be somewhat like Bonaparte:  I\nhave no control except over the part which I occupy, the instant\nI move, frost takes possession.\"’  In sickness only would he\nchange for the time his apartment and accept a few comforts. The\ndress too that he habitually adopted was of most inferior\nquality; and garments were constantly worn which the world would\ncall mean, though an almost feminine neatness preserved him from\nthe least appearance of neglect.\"[177]",

The\nhopelessness of Christian theology in respect of the flesh and\nthe natural man generally has, in systematizing fear, made of it\none tremendous incentive to self-mortification.  It would be\nquite unfair, however, in spite of the fact that this incentive\nhas often been worked in a mercenary way for hortatory purposes,\nto call it a mercenary incentive.  The impulse to expiate and do\npenance is, in its first intention, far too immediate and\nspontaneous an expression of self-despair and anxiety to be\nobnoxious to any such reproach.

        "“’On this path,’ M. Vianney said, “it is only the first step\nthat costs.  There is in mortification a balm and a savor without\nwhich one cannot live when once one has made their acquaintance.\nThere is but one way in which to give one’s self to God– that\nis, to give one’s self entirely, and to keep nothing for one’s\nself.  The little that one keeps is only good to trouble one and\nmake one suffer.’  Accordingly he imposed it on himself that he\nshould never smell a flower, never drink when parched with\nthirst, never drive away a fly, never show disgust before a\nrepugnant object, never complain of anything that had to do with\nhis personal comfort, never sit down, never lean upon his elbows\nwhen he was kneeling.  The Cure of Ars was very sensitive to\ncold, but he would never take means to protect himself against\nit.  During a very severe winter, one of his missionaries\ncontrived a false floor to his confessional and placed a metal\ncase of hot water beneath.  The trick succeeded, and the Saint\nwas deceived:  ’God is very good,’ he said with emotion.  ’This\nyear, through all the cold, my feet have always been warm.’\n\"[179]",

        "In this case the spontaneous impulse to make sacrifices for the\npure love of God was probably the uppermost conscious motive.  We\nmay class it, then, under our head 3.  Some authors think that\nthe impulse to sacrifice is the main religious phenomenon.  It is\na prominent, a universal phenomenon certainly, and lies deeper\nthan any special creed.  Here, for instance, is what seems to be\na spontaneous example of it, simply expressing what seemed right\nat the time between the individual and his Maker.  Cotton Mather,\nthe New England Puritan divine, is generally reputed a rather\ngrotesque pedant; yet what is more touchingly simple than his\nrelation of what happened when his wife came to die?",

So, two hours before my lovely consort expired, I\nkneeled by her bedside, and I took into my two hands a dear hand,\nthe dearest in the world.  With her thus in my hands, I solemnly\nand sincerely gave her up unto the Lord:  and in token of my real\nRESIGNATION, I gently put her out of my hands, and laid away a\nmost lovely hand, resolving that I would never touch it more. \nThis was the hardest, and perhaps the bravest action that ever I\ndid.  She . . . told me that she signed and sealed my act of\nresignation.  And though before that she called for me\ncontinually, she after this never asked for me any more.\"[180]",

        "Father Vianney’s asceticism taken in its totality was simply the\nresult of a permanent flood of high spiritual enthusiasm, longing\nto make proof of itself.  The Roman Church has, in its\nincomparable fashion, collected all the motives towards\nasceticism together, and so codified them that any one wishing to\npursue Christian perfection may find a practical system mapped\nout for him in any one of a number of ready-made manuals.[181]\nThe dominant Church notion of perfection is of course the\nnegative one of avoidance of sin.  Sin proceeds from\nconcupiscence, and concupiscence from our carnal passions and\ntemptations, chief of which are pride, sensuality in all its\nforms, and the loves of worldly excitement and possession.  All\nthese sources of sin must be resisted; and discipline and\nausterities are a most efficacious mode of meeting them.  Hence\nthere are always in these books chapters on self-mortification. \nBut whenever a procedure is codified, the more delicate spirit of\nit evaporates, and if we wish the undiluted ascetic spirit–the\npassion of self-contempt wreaking itself on the poor flesh, the\ndivine irrationality of devotion making a sacrificial gift of all\nit has (its sensibilities, namely) to the object of its\nadoration–we must go to autobiographies, or other individual\ndocuments.",

        "“He was in his youth of a temperament full of fire and life; and\nwhen this began to make itself felt, it was very grievous to him;\nand he sought by many devices how he might bring his body into\nsubjection.  He wore for a long time a hair shirt and an iron\nchain, until the blood ran from him, so that he was obliged to\nleave them off.  He secretly caused an undergarment to be made\nfor him; and in the undergarment he had strips of leather fixed,\ninto which a hundred and fifty brass nails, pointed and filed\nsharp, were driven, and the points of the nails were always\nturned towards the flesh.  He had this garment made very tight,\nand so arranged as to go round him and fasten in front in order\nthat it might fit the closer to his body, and the pointed nails\nmight be driven into his flesh; and it was high enough to reach\nupwards to his navel.  In this he used to sleep at night. Now in\nsummer, when it was hot, and he was very tired and ill from his\njourneyings, or when he held the office of lecturer, he would\nsometimes, as he lay thus in bonds, and oppressed with toil, and\ntormented also by noxious insects, cry aloud and give way to\nfretfulness, and twist round and round in agony, as a worm does\nwhen run through with a pointed needle.  It often seemed to him\nas if he were lying upon an ant-hill, from the torture caused by\nthe insects; for if he wished to sleep, or when he had fallen\nasleep, they vied with one another.[183] Sometimes he cried to\nAlmighty God in the fullness of his heart:  Alas! Gentle God,\nwhat a dying is this!  When a man is killed by murderers or\nstrong beasts of prey it is soon over; but I lie dying here under\nthe cruel insects, and yet cannot die.  The nights in winter were\nnever so long, nor was the summer so hot, as to make him leave\noff this exercise.  On the contrary, he devised something farther\n–two leathern loops into which he put his hands, and fastened\none on each side his throat, and made the fastenings so secure\nthat even if his cell had been on fire about him, he could not\nhave helped himself.  This he continued until his hands and arms\nhad become almost tremulous with the strain, and then he devised\nsomething else:  two leather gloves; and he caused a brazier to\nfit them all over with sharp-pointed brass tacks, and he used to\nput them on at night, in order that if he should try while asleep\nto throw off the hair undergarment, or relieve himself from the\ngnawings of the vile insects, the tacks might then stick into his\nbody.  And so it came to pass.  If ever he sought to help himself\nwith his hands in his sleep, he drove the sharp tacks into his\nbreast, and tore himself, so that his flesh festered. When after\nmany weeks the wounds had healed, he tore himself again and made\nfresh wounds.",
        "[183] “Insects,” i.e. lice, were an unfailing token of mediaeval\nsainthood. We read of Francis of Assisi’s sheepskin that “often a\ncompanion of the saint would take it to the fire to clean and\ndispediculate it, doing so, as he said, because the seraphic\nfather himself was no enemy of pedocchi, but on the contrary kept\nthem on him (le portava adosso) and held it for an honor and a\nglory to wear these celestial pearls in his habit.

        "“He continued this tormenting exercise for about sixteen years. \nAt the end of this time, when his blood was now chilled, and the\nfire of his temperament destroyed, there appeared to him in a\nvision on Whitsunday, a messenger from heaven, who told him that\nGod required this of him no longer.  Whereupon he discontinued\nit, and threw all these things away into a running stream.”",
        "Suso then tells how, to emulate the sorrows of his crucified\nLord, he made himself a cross with thirty protruding iron needles\nand nails.  This he bore on his bare back between his shoulders\nday and night.  “The first time that he stretched out this cross\nupon his back his tender frame was struck with terror at it, and\nblunted the sharp nails slightly against a stone.  But soon,\nrepenting of this womanly cowardice, he pointed them all again\nwith a file, and placed once more the cross upon him.  It made\nhis back, where the bones are, bloody and seared.  Whenever he\nsat down or stood up, it was as if a hedgehog-skin were on him. \nIf any one touched him unawares, or pushed against his clothes,\nit tore him.”",
        "Suso next tells of his penitences by means of striking this cross\nand forcing the nails deeper into the flesh, and likewise of his\nself-scourgings–a dreadful story–and then goes on as follows: \n\"At this same period the Servitor procured an old castaway door,\nand he used to lie upon it at night without any bedclothes to\nmake him comfortable, except that he took off his shoes and\nwrapped a thick cloak round him.  He thus secured for himself a\nmost miserable bed; for hard pea-stalks lay in humps under his\nhead, the cross with the sharp nails stuck into his back, his\narms were locked fast in bonds, the horsehair undergarment was\nround his loins, and the cloak too was heavy and the door hard.\nThus he lay in wretchedness, afraid to stir, just like a log, and\nhe would send up many a sigh to God.",
        "“In winter he suffered very much from the frost.  If he stretched\nout his feet they lay bare on the floor and froze, if he gathered\nthem up the blood became all on fire in his legs, and this was\ngreat pain.  His feet were full of sores, his legs dropsical, his\nknees bloody and seared, his loins covered with scars from the\nhorsehair, his body wasted, his mouth parched with intense\nthirst, and his hands tremulous from weakness.  Amid these\ntorments he spent his nights and days; and he endured them all\nout of the greatness of the love which he bore in his heart to\nthe Divine and Eternal Wisdom, our Lord Jesus Christ, whose\nagonizing sufferings he sought to imitate.  After a time he gave\nup this penitential exercise of the door, and instead of it he\ntook up his abode in a very small cell, and used the bench, which\nwas so narrow and short that he could not stretch himself upon\nit, as his bed.  In this hole, or upon the door, he lay at night\nin his usual bonds, for about eight years.  It was also his\ncustom, during the space of twenty-five years, provided he was\nstaying in the convent, never to go after compline in winter into\nany warm room, or to the convent stove to warm himself, no matter\nhow cold it might be, unless he was obliged to do so for other\nreasons.  Throughout all these years he never took a bath, either\na water or a sweating bath; and this he did in order to mortify\nhis comfort-seeking body.  He practiced during a long time such\nrigid poverty that he would neither receive nor touch a penny,\neither with leave or without it.  For a considerable time he\nstrove to attain such a high degree of purity that he would\nneither scratch nor touch any part of his body, save only his\nhands and feet.\"[184]",

        "So much for the phenomena to which the ascetic impulse will in\ncertain persons give rise.  In the ecclesiastically consecrated\ncharacter three minor branches of self-mortification have been\nrecognized as indispensable pathways to perfection.

        "First, of Obedience.  The secular life of our twentieth century\nopens with this virtue held in no high esteem.  The duty of the\nindividual to determine his own conduct and profit or suffer by\nthe consequences seems, on the contrary, to be one of our best\nrooted contemporary Protestant social ideals. So much so that it\nis difficult even imaginatively to comprehend how men possessed\nof an inner life of their own could ever have come to think the\nsubjection of its will to that of other finite creatures\nrecommendable.  I confess that to myself it seems something of a\nmystery.  Yet it evidently corresponds to a profound interior\nneed of many persons, and we must do our best to understand it.",
        "On the lowest possible plane, one sees how the expediency of\nobedience in a firm ecclesiastical organization must have led to\nits being viewed as meritorious.  Next, experience shows that\nthere are times in every one’s life when one can be better\ncounseled by others than by one’s self.  Inability to decide is\none of the commonest symptoms of fatigued nerves; friends who see\nour troubles more broadly, often see them more wisely than we do;\nso it is frequently an act of excellent virtue to consult and\nobey a doctor, a partner, or a wife.  But, leaving these lower\nprudential regions, we find, in the nature of some of the\nspiritual excitements which we have been studying, good reasons\nfor idealizing obedience. Obedience may spring from the general\nreligious phenomenon of inner softening and self-surrender and\nthrowing one’s self on higher powers.  So saving are these\nattitudes felt to be that in themselves, apart from utility, they\nbecome ideally consecrated; and in obeying a man whose\nfallibility we see through thoroughly, we, nevertheless, may feel\nmuch as we do when we resign our will to that of infinite wisdom.\nAdd self-despair and the passion of self-crucifixion to this, and\nobedience becomes an ascetic sacrifice, agreeable quite\nirrespective of whatever prudential uses it might have.",
        "It is as a sacrifice, a mode of “mortification,” that obedience\nis primarily conceived by Catholic writers, a “sacrifice which\nman offers to God, and of which he is himself both the priest and\nthe victim.  By poverty he immolates his exterior possessions; by\nchastity he immolates his body; by obedience he completes the\nsacrifice, and gives to God all that he yet holds as his own, his\ntwo most precious goods, his intellect and his will.  The\nsacrifice is then complete and unreserved, a genuine holocaust,\nfor the entire victim is now consumed for the honor of God.\"[186]\nAccordingly, in Catholic discipline, we obey our superior not as\nmere man, but as the representative of Christ.  Obeying God in\nhim by our intention, obedience is easy.  But when the text-book\ntheologians marshal collectively all their reasons for\nrecommending it, the mixture sounds to our ears rather odd.",

        "“One of the great consolations of the monastic life,” says a\nJesuit authority, “is the assurance we have that in obeying we\ncan commit no fault.  The Superior may commit a fault in\ncommanding you to do this thing or that, but you are certain that\nyou commit no fault so long as you obey, because God will only\nask you if you have duly performed what orders you received, and\nif you can furnish a clear account in that respect, you are\nabsolved entirely.  Whether the things you did were opportune, or\nwhether there were not something better that might have been\ndone, these are questions not asked of you, but rather of your\nSuperior.  The moment what you did was done obediently, God wipes\nit out of your account, and charges it to the Superior. So that\nSaint Jerome well exclaimed, in celebrating the advantages of\nobedience, ’Oh, sovereign liberty! Oh, holy and blessed security\nby which one become almost impeccable!’",
        "“Saint John Climachus is of the same sentiment when he calls\nobedience an excuse before God.  In fact, when God asks why you\nhave done this or that, and you reply, it is because I was so\nordered by my Superiors, God will ask for no other excuse.  As a\npassenger in a good vessel with a good pilot need give himself \nno farther concern, but may go to sleep in peace, because the\npilot has charge over all, and ’watches for him’; so a religious\nperson who lives under the yoke of obedience goes to heaven as if\nwhile sleeping, that is, while leaning entirely on the conduct of\nhis Superiors, who are the pilots of his vessel, and keep watch\nfor him continually.  It is no small thing, of a truth, to be\nable to cross the stormy sea of life on the shoulders and in the\narms of another, yet that is just the grace which God accords to\nthose who live under the yoke of obedience.  Their Superior bears\nall their burdens. . . . A certain grave doctor said that he\nwould rather spend his life in picking up straws by obedience,\nthan by his own responsible choice busy himself with the loftiest\nworks of charity, because one is certain of following the will of\nGod in whatever one may do from obedience, but never certain in\nthe same degree of anything which we may do of our own proper\nmovement.\"[187]",

        "“If any one of you,” he says, “will know whether or not he is\nreally poor in spirit, let him consider whether he loves the\nordinary consequences and effects of poverty, which are hunger,\nthirst, cold, fatigue, and the denudation of all conveniences.\nSee if you are glad to wear a worn-out habit full of patches. \nSee if you are glad when something is lacking to your meal, when\nyou are passed by in serving it, when what you receive is\ndistasteful to you, when your cell is out of repair.  If you are\nnot glad of these things, if instead of loving them you avoid\nthem, then there is proof that you have not attained the\nperfection of poverty of spirit.”  Rodriguez then goes on to\ndescribe the practice of poverty in more detail.  “The first\npoint is that which Saint Ignatius proposes in his constitutions,\nwhen he says, ’Let no one use anything as if it were his private\npossession.’ ’A religious person,’ he says, ’ought in respect to\nall the things that he uses, to be like a statue which one may\ndrape with clothing, but which feels no grief and makes no\nresistance when one strips it again.  It is in this way that you\nshould feel towards your clothes, your books, your cell, and\neverything else that you make use of; if ordered to quit them, or\nto exchange them for others, have no more sorrow than if you were\na statue being uncovered. In this way you will avoid using them\nas if they were your private possession.  But if, when you give\nup your cell, or yield possession of this or that object or\nexchange it for another, you feel repugnance and are not like a\nstatue, that shows that you view these things as if they were\nyour private property.’",
        "“And this is why our holy founder wished the superiors to test\ntheir monks somewhat as God tested Abraham, and to put their\npoverty and their obedience to trial, that by this means they may\nbecome acquainted with the degree of their virtue, and gain a\nchance to make ever farther progress in perfection, . . . making\nthe one move out of his room when he finds it comfortable and is\nattached to it; taking away from another a book of which he is\nfond; or obliging a third to exchange his garment for a worse\none.  Otherwise we should end by acquiring a species of property\nin all these several objects, and little by little the wall of\npoverty that surrounds us and constitutes our principal defense\nwould be thrown down.  The ancient fathers of the desert used\noften thus to treat their companions. . . . Saint Dositheus,\nbeing sick-nurse, desired a certain knife, and asked Saint\nDorotheus for it, not for his private use, but for employment in\nthe infirmary of which he had charge. Whereupon Saint Dorotheus\nanswered him:  ’Ha! Dositheus, so that knife pleases you so much!\nWill you be the slave of a knife or the slave of Jesus Christ! Do\nyou not blush with shame at wishing that a knife should be your\nmaster?  I will not let you touch it.’ Which reproach and refusal\nhad such an effect upon the holy disciple that since that time he\nnever touched the knife again.’ .  .  .",
        "“Therefore, in our rooms,” Father Rodriguez continues, “there\nmust be no other furniture than a bed, a table, a bench, and a\ncandlestick, things purely necessary, and nothing more.  It is\nnot allowed among us that our cells should be ornamented with\npictures or aught else, neither armchairs, carpets, curtains, nor\nany sort of cabinet or bureau of any elegance.  Neither is it\nallowed us to keep anything to eat, either for ourselves or for \nthose who may come to visit us.  We must ask permission to go to\nthe refectory even for a glass of water; and finally we may not\nkeep a book in which we can write a line, or which we may take\naway with us.  One cannot deny that thus we are in great poverty.",
        "But this poverty is at the same time a great repose and a great\nperfection.  For it would be inevitable, in case a religious\nperson were allowed to own supernuous possessions, that these\nthings would greatly occupy his mind, be it to acquire them, to\npreserve them, or to increase them; so that in not permitting us\nat all to own them, all these inconveniences are remedied. Among\nthe various good reasons why the company forbids secular persons\nto enter our cells, the principal one is that thus we may the\neasier be kept in poverty.  After all, we are all men, and if we\nwere to receive people of the world into our rooms, we should not\nhave the strength to remain within the bounds prescribed, but\nshould at least wish to adorn them with some books to give the\nvisitors a better opinion of our scholarship.\"[192]",

        "Since Hindu fakirs, Buddhist monks, and Mohammedan dervishes\nunite with Jesuits and Franciscans in idealizing poverty as the\nloftiest individual state, it is worth while to examine into the\nspiritual grounds for such a seemingly unnatural opinion.  And\nfirst, of those which lie closest to common human nature.",
        "The opposition between the men who HAVE and the men who ARE is\nimmemorial.  Though the gentleman, in the old- fashioned sense of\nthe man who is well born, has usually in point of fact been\npredaceous and reveled in lands and goods, yet he has never\nidentified his essence with these possessions, but rather with\nthe personal superiorities, the courage, generosity, and pride\nsupposed to be his birthright.  To certain huckstering kinds of\nconsideration he thanked God he was forever inaccessible, and if\nin life’s vicissitudes he should become destitute through their\nlack, he was glad to think that with his sheer valor he was all\nthe freer to work out his salvation.  “Wer nur selbst was hatte,\"\nsays Lessing’s Tempelherr, in Nathan the Wise, “mein Gott, mein\nGott, ich habe nichts!”  This ideal of the well-born man without\npossessions was embodied in knight-errantry and templardom; and,\nhideously corrupted as it has always been, it still dominates\nsentimentally, if not practically, the military and aristocratic\nview of life.  We glorify the soldier as the man absolutely\nunincumbered.  Owning nothing but his bare life, and willing to\ntoss that up at any moment when the cause commands him, he is the\nrepresentative of unhampered freedom in ideal directions.  The\nlaborer who pays with his person day by day, and has no rights\ninvested in the future, offers also much of this ideal\ndetachment.  Like the savage, he may make his bed wherever his\nright arm can support him, and from his simple and athletic\nattitude of observation, the property-owner seems buried and\nsmothered in ignoble externalities and trammels, “wading in straw\nand rubbish to his knees.”  The claims which THINGS make are\ncorrupters of manhood, mortgages on the soul, and a drag anchor\non our progress towards the empyrean.",
        "“Everything I meet with,” writes Whitefield, “seems to carry this\nvoice with it–’Go thou and preach the Gospel; be a pilgrim on\nearth; have no party or certain dwelling place.’ My heart echoes\nback, ’Lord Jesus, help me to do or suffer thy will. When thou\nseest me in danger of NESTLING–in pity–in tender pity–put a\nTHORN in my nest to prevent me from it.’\"[193]",

        "The loathing of “capital” with which our laboring classes today\nare growing more and more infected seems largely composed of this\nsound sentiment of antipathy for lives based on mere having.  As\nan anarchist poet writes:–",
        "“Not by accumulating riches, but by giving away that which you\nhave,",
        "“Shall you become beautiful;",

        "In short, lives based on having are less free than lives based\neither on doing or on being, and in the interest of action people\nsubject to spiritual excitement throw away possessions as so many\nclogs.  Only those who have no private interests can follow an\nideal straight away.  Sloth and cowardice creep in with every\ndollar or guinea we have to guard.  When a brother novice came to\nSaint Francis, saying:  “Father, it would be a great consolation\nto me to own a psalter, but even supposing that our general\nshould concede to me this indulgence, still I should like also to\nhave your consent,” Francis put him off with the examples of\nCharlemagne, Roland, and Oliver, pursuing the infidels in sweat\nand labor, and finally dying on the field of battle.  “So care\nnot,” he said, “for owning books and knowledge, but care rather\nfor works of goodness.”  And when some weeks later the novice\ncame again to talk of his craving for the psalter, Francis said: \n\"After you have got your psalter you will crave a breviary; and\nafter you have got your breviary you will sit in your stall like\na grand prelate, and will say to your brother:  “Hand me my\nbreviary.”.  .  . And thenceforward he denied all such requests,\nsaying:  A man possesses of learning only so much as comes out of\nhim in action, and a monk is a good preacher only so far as his\ndeeds proclaim him such, for every tree is known by its\nfruits.\"[195]",

        "But beyond this more worthily athletic attitude involved in doing\nand being, there is, in the desire of not having, something\nprofounder still, something related to that fundamental mystery\nof religious experience, the satisfaction found in absolute\nsurrender to the larger power.  So long as any secular safeguard\nis retained, so long as any residual prudential guarantee is\nclung to, so long the surrender is incomplete, the vital crisis\nis not passed, fear still stands sentinel, and mistrust of the\ndivine obtains:  we hold by two anchors, looking to God, it is\ntrue, after a fashion, but also holding by our proper\nmachinations.  In certain medical experiences we have the same\ncritical point to overcome.  A drunkard, or a morphine or cocaine\nmaniac, offers himself to be cured.  He appeals to the doctor to\nwean him from his enemy, but he dares not face blank abstinence. \nThe tyrannical drug is still an anchor to windward:  he hides\nsupplies of it among his clothing; arranges secretly to have it\nsmuggled in in case of need.  Even so an incompletely regenerate\nman still trusts in his own expedients.  His money is like the\nsleeping potion which the chronically wakeful patient keeps\nbeside his bed; he throws himself on God, but IF he should need\nthe other help, there it will be also.  Every one knows cases of\nthis incomplete and ineffective desire for reform-drunkards whom,\nwith all their self-reproaches and resolves, one perceives to be\nquite unwilling seriously to contemplate NEVER being drunk again!\nReally to give up anything on which we have relied, to give it up\ndefinitely, “for good and all” and forever, signifies one of\nthose radical alterations of character which came under our\nnotice in the lectures on conversion. In it the inner man rolls\nover into an entirely different position of equilibrium, lives in\na new centre of energy from this time on, and the turning-point\nand hinge of all such operations seems usually to involve the\nsincere acceptance of certain nakednesses and destitutions.",
        "Accordingly, throughout the annals of the saintly life, we find\nthis ever-recurring note:  Fling yourself upon God’s providence\nwithout making any reserve whatever–take no thought for the\nmorrow–sell all you have and give it to the poor–only when the\nsacrifice is ruthless and reckless will the higher safety really\narrive.  As a concrete example let me read a page from the\nbiography of Antoinette Bourignon, a good woman, much persecuted\nin her day by both Protestants and Catholics, because she would\nnot take her religion at second hand.  When a young girl, in her\nfather’s house–",
        "“She spent whole nights in prayer, oft repeating:  Lord, what\nwilt thou have me to do?  And being one night in a most profound\npenitence, she said from the bottom of her heart:  ’O my Lord!\nWhat must I do to please thee?  For I have nobody to teach me. \nSpeak to my soul and it will hear thee.’ At that instant she\nheard, as if another had spoke within her:  Forsake all earthly\nthings.  Separate thyself from the love of the creatures. Deny\nthyself.  She was quite astonished, not understanding this\nlanguage, and mused long on these three points, thinking how she\ncould fulfill them.  She thought she could not live without\nearthly things, nor without loving the creatures, nor without\nloving herself.  Yet she said, ’By thy Grace I will do it, Lord!’\nBut when she would perform her promise, she knew not where to\nbegin.  Having thought on the religious in monasteries, that they\nforsook all earthly things by being shut up in a cloister, and\nthe love of themselves by subjecting of their wills, she asked\nleave of her father to enter into a cloister of the barefoot\nCarmelites, but he would not permit it, saying he would rather\nsee her laid in her grave.  This seemed to her a great cruelty,\nfor she thought to find in the cloister the true Christians she\nhad been seeking, but she found afterwards that he knew the\ncloisters better than she, for after he had forbidden her, and\ntold her he would never permit her to be a religious, nor give\nher any money to enter there, yet she went to Father Laurens, the\nDirector, and offered to serve in the monastery and work hard for\nher bread, and be content with little, if he would receive her.\nAt which he smiled and said:  That cannot be.  We must have money\nto build; we take no maids without money; you must find the way\nto get it, else there is no entry here.",
        "“This astonished her greatly, and she was thereby undeceived as\nto the cloisters, resolving to forsake all company and live alone\ntill it should please God to show her what she ought to do and\nwhither to go.  She asked always earnestly, ’When shall I be\nperfectly thine, O my God?’ And she thought he still answered\nher, When thou shalt no longer possess anything, and shalt die to\nthyself.  ’And where shall I do that, Lord?’ He answered her, In\nthe desert.  This made so strong an impression on her soul that\nshe aspired after this; but being a maid of eighteen years only,\nshe was afraid of unlucky chances, and was never used to travel,\nand knew no way.  She laid aside all these doubts and said,\n’Lord, thou wilt guide me how and where it shall please thee.  It\nis for thee that I do it.  I will lay aside my habit of a maid,\nand will take that of a hermit that I may pass unknown.’ Having\nthen secretly made ready this habit, while her parents thought to\nhave married her, her father having promised her to a rich French\nmerchant, she prevented the time, and on Easter evening, having\ncut her hair, put on the habit, and slept a little, she went out\nof her chamber about four in the morning, taking nothing but one\npenny to buy bread for that day.  And it being said to her in\ngoing out, Where is thy faith?  in a penny?  she threw it away,\nbegging pardon of God for her fault, and saying, ’No, Lord, my\nfaith is not in a penny, but in thee alone.’  Thus she went away\nwholly delivered from the heavy burthen of the cares and good\nthings of this world, and found her soul so satisfied that she no\nlonger wished for anything upon earth, resting entirely upon God,\nwith this only fear lest she should be discovered and be obliged\nto return home; for she felt already more content in this poverty\nthan she had done for all her life in all the delights of the\nworld.\"[196]",

        "Another example from Starbuck’s MS. collection:–",
        "“At a meeting held at six the next morning, I heard a man relate\nhis experience.  He said:  The Lord asked him if he would\nconfess Christ among the quarrymen with whom he worked, and he\nsaid he would.  Then he asked him if he would give up to be used\nof the Lord the four hundred dollars he had laid up, and he said\nhe would and thus the Lord saved him.  The thought came to me at\nonce that I had never made a real consecration either of myself\nor of my property to the Lord, but had always tried to serve the\nLord in my way.  Now the Lord asked me if I would serve him in\nHIS way, and go out alone and penniless if he so ordered.  The\nquestion was pressed home, and I must decide:  To forsake all and\nhave him, or have all and lose him!  I soon decided to take him;\nand the blessed assurance came, that he had taken me for his own,\nand my joy was full.  I returned home from the meeting with\nfeelings as simple as a child.  I thought all would be glad to\nhear of the joy of the Lord that possessed me, and so I began to\ntell the simple story.  But to my great surprise, the pastors\n(for I attended meetings in three churches) opposed the\nexperience and said it was fanaticism, and one told the members\nof his church to shun those that professed it, and I soon found\nthat my foes were those of my own household.”",

        "Over and above the mystery of self-surrender, there are in the\ncult of poverty other religious mysteries.  There is the mystery\nof veracity:  “Naked came I into the world,” etc.– whoever first\nsaid that, possessed this mystery.  My own bare entity must fight\nthe battle–shams cannot save me.  There is also the mystery of\ndemocracy, or sentiment of the equality before God of all his\ncreatures.  This sentiment (which seems in general to have been\nmore widespread in Mohammedan than in Christian lands) tends to\nnullify man’s usual acquisitiveness.  Those who have it spurn\ndignities and honors, privileges and advantages, preferring, as I\nsaid in a former lecture, to grovel on the common level before\nthe face of God.  It is not exactly the sentiment of humility,\nthough it comes so close to it in practice.  It is HUMANITY,\nrather, refusing to enjoy anything that others do not share. A\nprofound moralist, writing of Christ’s saying, “Sell all thou\nhast and follow me,” proceeds as follows:–",
        "“Christ may have meant:  If you love mankind absolutely you will\nas a result not care for any possessions whatever, and this seems\na very likely proposition.  But it is one thing to believe that a\nproposition is probably true; it is another thing to see it as a\nfact.  If you loved mankind as Christ loved them, you would see\nhis conclusion as a fact.  It would be obvious.  You would sell\nyour goods, and they would be no loss to you.  These truths,\nwhile literal to Christ, and to any mind that has Christ’s love\nfor mankind, become parables to lesser natures.  There are in\nevery generation people who, beginning innocently, with no\npredetermined intention of becoming saints, find themselves drawn\ninto the vortex by their interest in helping mankind, and by the\nunderstanding that comes from actually doing it.  The abandonment\nof their old mode of life is like dust in the balance.  It is\ndone gradually, incidentally, imperceptibly.  Thus the whole\nquestion of the abandonment of luxury is no question at all, but\na mere incident to another question, namely, the degree to which\nwe abandon ourselves to the remorseless logic of our love for\nothers.\"[197]",

        "But in all these matters of sentiment one must have “been there\"\none’s self in order to understand them.  No American can ever\nattain to understanding the loyalty of a Briton towards his king,\nof a German towards his emperor; nor can a Briton or German ever\nunderstand the peace of heart of an American in having no king,\nno Kaiser, no spurious nonsense, between him and the common God\nof all.  If sentiments as simple as these are mysteries which one\nmust receive as gifts of birth, how much more is this the case\nwith those subtler religious sentiments which we have been\nconsidering!  One can never fathom an emotion or divine its\ndictates by standing outside of it.  In the glowing hour of\nexcitement, however, all incomprehensibilities are solved, and\nwhat was so enigmatical from without becomes transparently\nobvious.  Each emotion obeys a logic of its own, and makes\ndeductions which no other logic can draw.  Piety and charity live\nin a different universe from worldly lusts and fears, and form\nanother centre of energy altogether.  As in a supreme sorrow\nlesser vexations may become a consolation; as a supreme love may\nturn minor sacrifices into gain; so a supreme trust may render\ncommon safeguards odious, and in certain glows of generous\nexcitement it may appear unspeakably mean to retain one’s hold of\npersonal possessions.  The only sound plan, if we are ourselves\noutside the pale of such emotions, is to observe as well as we\nare able those who feel them, and to record faithfully what we\nobserve; and this, I need hardly say, is what I have striven to\ndo in these last two descriptive lectures, which I now hope will\nhave covered the ground sufficiently for our present needs.",
        "We have now passed in review the more important of the phenomena\nwhich are regarded as fruits of genuine religion and\ncharacteristics of men who are devout.  Today we have to change\nour attitude from that of description to that of appreciation; we\nhave to ask whether the fruits in question can help us to judge\nthe absolute value of what religion adds to human life.  Were I\nto parody Kant, I should say that a “Critique of pure\nSaintliness” must be our theme.",
        "If, in turning to this theme, we could descend upon our subject\nfrom above like Catholic theologians, with our fixed definitions\nof man and man’s perfection and our positive dogmas about God, we\nshould have an easy time of it.  Man’s perfection would be the\nfulfillment of his end; and his end would be union with his\nMaker.  That union could be pursued by him along three paths,\nactive, purgative, and contemplative, respectively; and progress\nalong either path would be a simple matter to measure by the\napplication of a limited number of theological and moral\nconceptions and definitions.  The absolute significance and value\nof any bit of religious experience we might hear of would thus be\ngiven almost mathematically into our hands.",
        "If convenience were everything, we ought now to grieve at finding\nourselves cut off from so admirably convenient a method as this. \nBut we did cut ourselves off from it deliberately in those\nremarks which you remember we made, in our first lecture, about\nthe empirical method; and it must be <321> confessed that after\nthat act of renunciation we can never hope for clean-cut and\nscholastic results.  WE cannot divide man sharply into an animal\nand a rational part.  WE cannot distinguish natural from\nsupernatural effects; nor among the latter know which are favors\nof God, and which are counterfeit operations of the demon.  WE\nhave merely to collect things together without any special a\npriori theological system, and out of an aggregate of piecemeal\njudgments as to the value of this and that experience–judgments\nin which our general philosophic prejudices, our instincts, and\nour common sense are our only guides–decide that ON THE WHOLE\none type of religion is approved by its fruits, and another type\ncondemned.  “On the whole\"–I fear we shall never escape\ncomplicity with that qualification, so dear to your practical\nman, so repugnant to your systematizer!",
        "I also fear that as I make this frank confession, I may seem to\nsome of you to throw our compass overboard, and to adopt caprice\nas our pilot.  Skepticism or wayward choice, you may think, can\nbe the only results of such a formless method as I have taken up.\nA few remarks in deprecation of such an opinion, and in farther\nexplanation of the empiricist principles which I profess, may\ntherefore appear at this point to be in place.",
        "Abstractly, it would seem illogical to try to measure the worth\nof a religion’s fruits in merely human terms of value. How CAN\nyou measure their worth without considering whether the God\nreally exists who is supposed to inspire them?  If he really\nexists, then all the conduct instituted by men to meet his wants\nmust necessarily be a reasonable fruit of his religion–it would\nbe unreasonable only in case he did not exist.  If, for instance,\nyou were to condemn a religion of human or animal sacrifices by\nvirtue of your subjective sentiments, and if all the while a\ndeity were really there demanding such sacrifices, you would be\nmaking a theoretical mistake by tacitly assuming that the deity\nmust be non-existent; you would be setting up a theology of your\nown as much as if you were a scholastic philosopher.",
        "To this extent, to the extent of disbelieving peremptorily in\ncertain types of deity, I frankly confess that we must be\ntheologians.  If disbeliefs can be said to constitute a theology,\nthen the prejudices, instincts, and common sense which I chose as\nour guides make theological partisans of us whenever they make\ncertain beliefs abhorrent.",
        "But such common-sense prejudices and instincts are themselves the\nfruit of an empirical evolution.  Nothing is more striking than\nthe secular alteration that goes on in the moral and religious\ntone of men, as their insight into nature and their social\narrangements progressively develop.  After an interval of a few\ngenerations the mental climate proves unfavorable to notions of\nthe deity which at an earlier date were perfectly satisfactory: \nthe older gods have fallen below the common secular level, and\ncan no longer be believed in.  Today a deity who should require\nbleeding sacrifices to placate him would be too sanguinary to be\ntaken seriously.  Even if powerful historical credentials were\nput forward in his favor, we would not look at them.  Once, on\nthe contrary, his cruel appetites were of themselves credentials.",
        "They positively recommended him to men’s imaginations in ages\nwhen such coarse signs of power were respected and no others\ncould be understood.  Such deities then were worshiped because\nsuch fruits were relished.",
        "Doubtless historic accidents always played some later part, but\nthe original factor in fixing the figure of the gods must always\nhave been psychological.  The deity to whom the prophets, seers,\nand devotees who founded the particular cult bore witness was\nworth something to them personally. They could use him.  He\nguided their imagination, warranted their hopes, and controlled\ntheir will–or else they required him as a safeguard against the\ndemon and a curber of other people’s crimes.  In any case, they\nchose him for the value of the fruits he seemed to them to yield.",
        "So soon as the fruits began to seem quite worthless; so soon as\nthey conflicted with indispensable human ideals, or thwarted too\nextensively other values; so soon as they appeared childish,\ncontemptible, or immoral when reflected on, the deity grew\ndiscredited, and was erelong neglected and forgotten.  It was in\nthis way that the Greek and Roman gods ceased to be believed in\nby educated pagans; it is thus that we ourselves judge of the\nHindu, Buddhist, and Mohammedan theologies; Protestants have so\ndealt with the Catholic notions of deity, and liberal Protestants\nwith older Protestant notions; it is thus that Chinamen judge of\nus, and that all of us now living will be judged by our\ndescendants.  When we cease to admire or approve what the\ndefinition of a deity implies, we end by deeming that deity\nincredible.",
        "Few historic changes are more curious than these mutations of\ntheological opinion.  The monarchical type of sovereignty was,\nfor example, so ineradicably planted in the mind of our own\nforefathers that a dose of cruelty and arbitrariness in their\ndeity seems positively to have been required by their\nimagination.  They called the cruelty “retributive justice,” and\na God without it would certainly have struck them as not\n\"sovereign” enough.  But today we abhor the very notion of\neternal suffering inflicted; and that arbitrary dealing-out of\nsalvation and damnation to selected individuals, of which\nJonathan Edwards could persuade himself that he had not only a\nconviction, but a “delightful conviction,” as of a doctrine\n\"exceeding pleasant, bright, and sweet,” appears to us, if\nsovereignly anything, sovereignly irrational and mean.  Not only\nthe cruelty, but the paltriness of character of the gods believed\nin by earlier centuries also strikes later centuries with\nsurprise.  We shall see examples of it from the annals of\nCatholic saintship which makes us rub our Protestant eyes. \nRitual worship in general appears to the modern\ntranscendentalist, as well as to the ultra-puritanic type of\nmind, as if addressed to a deity of an almost absurdly childish\ncharacter, taking delight in toy-shop furniture, tapers and\ntinsel, costume and mumbling and mummery, and finding his “glory\"\nincomprehensibly enhanced thereby:–just as on the other hand the\nformless spaciousness of pantheism appears quite empty to\nritualistic natures, and the gaunt theism of evangelical sects\nseems intolerably bald and chalky and bleak.",
        "Luther, says Emerson, would have cut off his right hand rather\nthan nail his theses to the door at Wittenberg, if he had\nsupposed that they were destined to lead to the pale negations of\nBoston Unitarianism.",
        "So far, then, although we are compelled, whatever may be our\npretensions to empiricism, to employ some sort of a standard of\ntheological probability of our own whenever we assume to estimate\nthe fruits of other men’s religion, yet this very standard has\nbeen begotten out of the drift of common life.  It is the voice\nof human experience within us, judging and condemning all gods\nthat stand athwart the pathway along which it feels itself to be\nadvancing.  Experience, if we take it in the largest sense, is\nthus the parent of those disbeliefs which, it was charged, were\ninconsistent with the experiential method.  The inconsistency,\nyou see, is immaterial, and the charge may be neglected.",
        "If we pass from disbeliefs to positive beliefs, it seems to me\nthat there is not even a formal inconsistency to be laid against\nour method.  The gods we stand by are the gods we need and can\nuse, the gods whose demands on us are reinforcements of our\ndemands on ourselves and on one another. What I then propose to\ndo is, briefly stated, to test saintliness by common sense, to\nuse human standards to help us decide how far the religious life\ncommends itself as an ideal kind of human activity.  If it\ncommends itself, then any theological beliefs that may inspire\nit, in so far forth will stand accredited.  If not, then they\nwill be discredited, and all without reference to anything but\nhuman working principles.  It is but the elimination of the\nhumanly unfit, and the survival of the humanly fittest, applied\nto religious beliefs; and if we look at history candidly and\nwithout prejudice, we have to admit that no religion has ever in\nthe long run established or proved itself in any other way. \nReligions have APPROVED themselves; they have ministered to\nsundry vital needs which they found reigning.  When they violated\nother needs too strongly, or when other faiths came which served\nthe same needs better, the first religions were supplanted.",
        "The needs were always many, and the tests were never sharp.  So\nthe reproach of vagueness and subjectivity and “on the\nwhole\"-ness, which can with perfect legitimacy be addressed to\nthe empirical method as we are forced to use it, is after all a\nreproach to which the entire life of man in dealing with these\nmatters is obnoxious.  No religion has ever yet owed its\nprevalence to “apodictic certainty.”    In a later lecture I will\nask whether objective certainty can ever be added by theological\nreasoning to a religion that already empirically prevails.",
        "One word, also, about the reproach that in following this sort of\nan empirical method we are handing ourselves over to systematic\nskepticism.",
        "Since it is impossible to deny secular alterations in our\nsentiments and needs, it would be absurd to affirm that one’s own\nage of the world can be beyond correction by the next age. \nSkepticism cannot, therefore, be ruled out by any set of thinkers\nas a possibility against which their conclusions are secure; and\nno empiricist ought to claim exemption from this universal\nliability.  But to admit one’s liability to correction is one\nthing, and to embark upon a sea of wanton doubt is another.  Of\nwillfully playing into the hands of skepticism we cannot be\naccused.  He who acknowledges the imperfectness of his\ninstrument, and makes allowance <326> for it in discussing his\nobservations, is in a much better position for gaining truth than\nif he claimed his instrument to be infallible.  Or is dogmatic or\nscholastic theology less doubted in point of fact for claiming,\nas it does, to be in point of right undoubtable?  And if not,\nwhat command over truth would this kind of theology really lose\nif, instead of absolute certainty, she only claimed reasonable\nprobability for her conclusions?  If WE claim only reasonable\nprobability, it will be as much as men who love the truth can\never at any given moment hope to have within their grasp. Pretty\nsurely it will be more than we could have had, if we were\nunconscious of our liability to err.",
        "Nevertheless, dogmatism will doubtless continue to condemn us for\nthis confession.  The mere outward form of inalterable certainty\nis so precious to some minds that to renounce it explicitly is\nfor them out of the question.  They will claim it even where the\nfacts most patently pronounce its folly.  But the safe thing is\nsurely to recognize that all the insights of creatures of a day\nlike ourselves must be provisional. The wisest of critics is an\naltering being, subject to the better insight of the morrow, and\nright at any moment, only “up to date” and “on the whole.”   \nWhen larger ranges of truth open, it is surely best to be able to\nopen ourselves to their reception, unfettered by our previous\npretensions. “Heartily know, when half-gods go, the gods arrive.”",
        "The fact of diverse judgments about religious phenomena is\ntherefore entirely unescapable, whatever may be one’s own desire\nto attain the irreversible.  But apart from that fact, a more\nfundamental question awaits us, the question whether men’s\nopinions ought to be expected to be absolutely uniform in this\nfield.  Ought all men to have the same religion? Ought they to\napprove the same fruits and follow the same leadings?  Are they\nso like in their inner needs that, for hard and soft, for proud\nand humble, for strenuous and lazy, for healthy-minded and\ndespairing, exactly the same religious incentives are required? \nOr are different functions in the organism of humanity allotted\nto different types of man, so that some may really be the better\nfor a religion of consolation and reassurance, whilst others are\nbetter for one of terror and reproof?  It might conceivably be\nso; and we shall, I think, more and more suspect it to be so as\nwe go on. And if it be so, how can any possible judge or critic\nhelp being biased in favor of the religion by which his own needs\nare best met?  He aspires to impartiality; but he is too close to\nthe struggle not to be to some degree a participant, and he is\nsure to approve most warmly those fruits of piety in others which\ntaste most good and prove most nourishing to HIM.",
        "I am well aware of how anarchic much of what I say may sound. \nExpressing myself thus abstractly and briefly, I may seem to\ndespair of the very notion of truth.  But I beseech you to\nreserve your judgment until we see it applied to the details\nwhich lie before us.  I do indeed disbelieve that we or any other\nmortal men can attain on a given day to absolutely incorrigible\nand unimprovable truth about such matters of fact as those with\nwhich religions deal.  But I reject this dogmatic ideal not out\nof a perverse delight in intellectual instability.  I am no lover\nof disorder and doubt as such.  Rather do I fear to lose truth by\nthis pretension to possess it already wholly.  That we can gain\nmore and more of it by moving always in the right direction, I\nbelieve as much as any one, and I hope to bring you all to my way\nof thinking before the termination of these lectures.  Till then,\ndo not, I pray you, harden your minds irrevocably against the\nempiricism which I profess.",
        "I will waste no more words, then, in abstract justification of my\nmethod, but seek immediately to use it upon the facts.",
        "In critically judging of the value of religious phenomena, it is\nvery important to insist on the distinction between religion as\nan individual personal function, and religion as an\ninstitutional, corporate, or tribal product.  I drew this\ndistinction, you may remember, in my second lecture.  The word\n\"religion,” as ordinarily used, is equivocal.  A survey of\nhistory shows us that, as a rule, religious geniuses attract\ndisciples, and produce groups of sympathizers.  When these groups\nget strong enough to “organize” themselves, they become\necclesiastical institutions with corporate ambitions of their\nown.  The spirit of politics and the lust of dogmatic rule are\nthen apt to enter and to contaminate the originally innocent\nthing; so that when we hear the word “religion” nowadays, we\nthink inevitably of some “church” or other; and to some persons\nthe word “church” suggests so much hypocrisy and tyranny and\nmeanness and tenacity of superstition that in a wholesale\nundiscerning way they glory in saying that they are “down” on\nreligion altogether.  Even we who belong to churches do not\nexempt other churches than our own from the general condemnation.",
        "But in this course of lectures ecclesiastical institutions hardly\nconcern us at all.  The religious experience which we are\nstudying is that which lives itself out within the private\nbreast.  First-hand individual experience of this kind has always\nappeared as a heretical sort of innovation to those who witnessed\nits birth.  Naked comes it into the world and lonely; and it has\nalways, for a time at least, driven him who had it into the\nwilderness, often into the literal wilderness out of doors, where\nthe Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, St. Francis, George Fox, and so many\nothers had to go.  George Fox expresses well this isolation; and\nI can do no better at this point than read to you a page from his\nJournal, referring to the period of his youth when religion began\nto ferment within him seriously.",
        "“I fasted much,” Fox says, “walked abroad in solitary places many\ndays, and often took my Bible, and sat in hollow trees and\nlonesome places until night came on; and frequently in the night\nwalked mournfully about by myself; for I was a man of sorrows in\nthe time of the first workings of the Lord in me.",
        "“During all this time I was never joined in profession of\nreligion with any, but gave up myself to the Lord, having\nforsaken all evil company, taking leave of father and mother, and\nall other relations, and traveled up and down as a stranger on\nthe earth, which way the Lord inclined my heart; taking a chamber\nto myself in the town where I came, and tarrying sometimes more,\nsometimes less in a place:  for I durst not stay long in a place,\nbeing afraid both of professor and profane, lest, being a tender\nyoung man, I should be hurt by conversing much with either.  For\nwhich reason I kept much as a stranger, seeking heavenly wisdom\nand getting knowledge from the Lord; and was brought off from\noutward things, to rely on the Lord alone.  As I had forsaken the\npriests, so I left the separate preachers also, and those called\nthe most experienced people; for I saw there was none among them\nall that could speak to my condition.  And when all my hopes in\nthem and in all men were gone so that I had nothing outwardly to\nhelp me, nor could tell what to do; then, oh then, I heard a\nvoice which said, ’There is one, even Jesus Christ, that can\nspeak to thy condition.’  When I heard it, my heart did leap for\njoy.  Then the Lord let me see why there was none upon the earth\nthat could speak to my condition. I had not fellowship with any\npeople, priests, nor professors, nor any sort of separated\npeople.  I was afraid of all carnal talk and talkers, for I could\nsee nothing but corruptions.  When I was in the deep, under all\nshut up, I could not believe that I should ever overcome; my\ntroubles, my sorrows, and my temptations were so great that I\noften thought I should have despaired, I was so tempted.  But\nwhen Christ opened to me how he was tempted by the same devil,\nand had overcome him, and had bruised his head; and that through\nhim and his power, life, grace, and spirit, I should overcome\nalso, I had confidence in him.  If I had had a king’s diet,\npalace, and attendance, all would have been as nothing, for\nnothing gave me comfort but the Lord by his power.  I saw\nprofessors, priests, and people were whole and at ease in that\ncondition which was my misery, and they loved that which I would\nhave been rid of.  But the Lord did stay my desires upon himself,\nand my care was cast upon him alone.\"[198]",

        "A genuine first-hand religious experience like this is bound to\nbe a heterodoxy to its witnesses, the prophet appearing as a mere\nlonely madman.  If his doctrine prove contagious enough to spread\nto any others, it becomes a definite and labeled heresy.  But if\nit then still prove contagious enough to triumph over\npersecution, it becomes itself an orthodoxy; and when a religion\nhas become an orthodoxy, its day of inwardness is over:  the\nspring is dry; the faithful live at second hand exclusively and\nstone the prophets in their turn.  The new church, in spite of\nwhatever human goodness it may foster, can be henceforth counted\non as a staunch ally in every attempt to stifle the spontaneous\nreligious spirit, and to stop all later bubblings of the fountain\nfrom which in purer days it drew its own supply of inspiration.\nUnless, indeed, by adopting new movements of the spirit it can\nmake capital out of them and use them for its selfish corporate\ndesigns! Of protective action of this politic sort, promptly or\ntardily decided on, the dealings of the Roman ecclesiasticism\nwith many individual saints and prophets yield examples enough\nfor our instruction.",
        "The plain fact is that men’s minds are built, as has been often\nsaid, in water-tight compartments.  Religious after a fashion,\nthey yet have many other things in them beside their religion,\nand unholy entanglements and associations inevitably obtain.  The\nbasenesses so commonly charged to religion’s account are thus,\nalmost all of them, not chargeable at all to religion proper, but\nrather to religion’s wicked practical partner, the spirit of\ncorporate dominion.  And the bigotries are most of them in their\nturn chargeable to religion’s wicked intellectual partner, the\nspirit of dogmatic dominion, the passion for laying down the law\nin the form of an absolutely closed-in theoretic system.  The\necclesiastical spirit in general is the sum of these two spirits\nof dominion; and I beseech you never to confound the phenomena of\nmere tribal or corporate psychology which it presents with those\nmanifestations of the purely interior life which are the\nexclusive object of our study.  The baiting of Jews, the hunting\nof Albigenses and Waldenses, the stoning of Quakers and ducking\nof Methodists, the murdering of Mormons and the massacring of\nArmenians, express much rather that aboriginal human neophobia,\nthat pugnacity of which we all share the vestiges, and that\ninborn hatred of the alien and of eccentric and non-conforming\nmen as aliens, than they express the positive piety of the\nvarious perpetrators.  Piety is the mask, the inner force is\ntribal instinct.  You believe as little as I do, in spite of the\nChristian unction with which the German emperor addressed his\ntroops upon their way to China, that the conduct which he\nsuggested, and in which other Christian armies went beyond them,\nhad anything whatever to do with the interior religious life of\nthose concerned in the performance.",
        "Well, no more for past atrocities than for this atrocity should\nwe make piety responsible.  At most we may blame piety for not\navailing to check our natural passions, and sometimes for\nsupplying them with hypocritical pretexts. But hypocrisy also\nimposes obligations, and with the pretext usually couples some\nrestriction; and when the passion gust is over, the piety may\nbring a reaction of repentance which the irreligious natural man\nwould not have shown.",
        "For many of the historic aberrations which have been laid to her\ncharge, religion as such, then, is not to blame.  Yet of the\ncharge that over-zealousness or fanaticism is one of her\nliabilities we cannot wholly acquit her, so I will next make a\nremark upon that point.  But I will preface it by a preliminary\nremark which connects itself with much that follows.\n \nOur survey of the phenomena of saintliness has unquestionably\nproduced in your minds an impression of extravagance. Is it\nnecessary, some of you have asked, as one example after another\ncame before us, to be quite so fantastically good as that?  We\nwho have no vocation for the extremer ranges of sanctity will\nsurely be let off at the last day if our humility, asceticism,\nand devoutness prove of a less convulsive sort.  This practically\namounts to saying that much that it is legitimate to admire in\nthis field need nevertheless not be imitated, and that religious\nphenomena, like all other human phenomena, are subject to the law\nof the golden mean.  Political reformers accomplish their\nsuccessive tasks in the history of nations by being blind for the\ntime to other causes.  Great schools of art work out the effects\nwhich it is their mission to reveal, at the cost of a\none-sidedness for which other schools must make amends.  We\naccept a John Howard, a Mazzini, a Botticelli, a Michael Angelo,\nwith a kind of indulgence.  We are glad they existed to show us\nthat way, but we are glad there are also other ways of seeing and\ntaking life.  So of many of the saints whom we have looked at. \nWe are proud of a human nature that could be so passionately\nextreme, but we shrink from advising others to follow the\nexample.  The conduct we blame ourselves for not following lies\nnearer to the middle line of human effort. It is less dependent\non particular beliefs and doctrines.  It is such as wears well in\ndifferent ages, such as under different skies all judges are able\nto commend.",
        "The fruits of religion, in other words, are, like all human\nproducts, liable to corruption by excess.  Common sense must\njudge them.  It need not blame the votary; but it may be able to\npraise him only conditionally, as one who acts faithfully\naccording to his lights.  He shows us heroism in one way, but the\nunconditionally good way is that for which no indulgence need be\nasked.\n \nWe find that error by excess is exemplified by every saintly\nvirtue.  Excess, in human faculties, means usually one-sidedness\nor want of balance; for it is hard to imagine an essential\nfaculty too strong, if only other faculties equally strong be\nthere to cooperate with it in action.  Strong affections need a\nstrong will; strong active powers need a strong intellect; strong\nintellect needs strong sympathies, to keep life steady.  If the\nbalance exist, no one faculty can possibly be too strong–we only\nget the stronger all-round character.  In the life of saints,\ntechnically so called, the spiritual faculties are strong, but\nwhat gives the impression of extravagance proves usually on\nexamination to be a relative deficiency of intellect.  Spiritual\nexcitement takes pathological forms whenever other interests are\ntoo few and the intellect too narrow.  We find this exemplified\nby all the saintly attributes in turn–devout love of God,\npurity, charity, asceticism, all may lead astray.  I will run\nover these virtues in succession.",
        "First of all let us take Devoutness.  When unbalanced, one of its\nvices is called Fanaticism.  Fanaticism (when not a mere\nexpression of ecclesiastical ambition) is only loyalty carried to\na convulsive extreme.  When an intensely loyal and narrow mind is\nonce grasped by the feeling that a certain superhuman person is\nworthy of its exclusive devotion, one of the first things that\nhappens is that it idealizes the devotion itself.  To adequately\nrealize the merits of the idol gets to be considered the one\ngreat merit of the worshiper; and the sacrifices and servilities\nby which savage tribesmen have from time immemorial exhibited\ntheir faithfulness to chieftains are now outbid in favor of the\ndeity.  Vocabularies are exhausted and languages altered in the\nattempt to praise him enough; death is looked on as gain if it\nattract his grateful notice; and the personal attitude of being\nhis devotee becomes what one might almost call a new and exalted\nkind of professional specialty within the tribe.[199] The legends\nthat gather round the lives of holy persons are fruits of this\nimpulse to celebrate and glorify.  The Buddha[200] and\nMohammed[201] and their companions and many Christian saints are\nincrusted with a heavy jewelry of anecdotes which are meant to be\nhonorific, but are simply abgeschmackt and silly, and form a\ntouching expression of man’s misguided propensity to praise.",
        "[199] Christian saints have had their specialties of devotion,\nSaint Francis to Christ’s wounds; Saint Anthony of Padua to\nChrist’s childhood; Saint Bernard to his humanity; Saint Teresa\nto Saint Joseph, etc.  The Shi-ite Mohammedans venerate Ali, the\nProphet’s son-in-law, instead of Abu-bekr, his brother-in-law. \nVambery describes a dervish whom he met in Persia, “who had\nsolemnly vowed, thirty years before, that he would never employ\nhis organs of speech otherwise but in uttering, everlastingly,\nthe name of his favorite, Ali, Ali.  He thus wished to signify to\nthe world that he was the most devoted partisan of that Ali who\nhad been dead a thousand years.  In his own home, speaking with\nhis wife, children, and friends, no other word but ’Ali!’ ever\npassed his lips.  If he wanted food or drink or anything else, he\nexpressed his wants still by repeating ’Ali!’  Begging or buying\nat the bazaar, it was always ’Ali!’  Treated ill or generously,\nhe would still harp on his monotonous ’Ali!’  Latterly his zeal\nassumed such tremendous proportions that, like a madman, he would\nrace, the whole day, up and down the streets of the town,\nthrowing his stick high up into the air, and shriek our, all the\nwhile, at the top of his voice, ’Ali!’  This dervish was\nvenerated by everybody as a saint, and received everywhere with\nthe greatest distinction.”  Arminius Vambery, his Life and\nAdventures, written by Himself, London, 1889, p. 69.  On the\nanniversary of the death of Hussein, Ali’s son, the Shi-ite\nMoslems still make the air resound with cries of his name and\nAli’s.",

        "An immediate consequence of this condition of mind is jealousy\nfor the deity’s honor.  How can the devotee show his loyalty\nbetter than by sensitiveness in this regard?  The slightest\naffront or neglect must be resented, the deity’s enemies must be\nput to shame.  In exceedingly narrow minds and active wills, such\na care may become an engrossing preoccupation; and crusades have\nbeen preached and massacres instigated for no other reason than\nto remove a fancied slight upon the God.  Theologies representing\nthe gods as mindful of their glory, and churches with\nimperialistic policies, have conspired to fan this temper to a\nglow, so that intolerance and persecution have come to be vices\nassociated by some of us inseparably with the saintly mind. They\nare unquestionably its besetting sins.  The saintly temper is a\nmoral temper, and a moral temper has often to be cruel.  It is a\npartisan temper, and that is cruel.  Between his own and\nJehovah’s enemies a David knows no difference; a Catherine of\nSiena, panting to stop the warfare among Christians which was the\nscandal of her epoch, can think of no better method of union\namong them than a crusade to massacre the Turks; Luther finds no\nword of protest or regret over the atrocious tortures with which\nthe Anabaptist leaders were put to death; and a Cromwell praises\nthe Lord for delivering his enemies into his hands for\n\"execution.”  Politics come in in all such cases; but piety finds\nthe partnership not quite unnatural.  So, when “freethinkers\"\ntell us that religion and fanaticism are twins, we cannot make an\nunqualified denial of the charge.",
        "Fanaticism must then be inscribed on the wrong side of religion’s\naccount, so long as the religious person’s intellect is on the\nstage which the despotic kind of God satisfies.  But as soon as\nthe God is represented as less intent on his own honor and glory,\nit ceases to be a danger.",
        "Fanaticism is found only where the character is masterful and\naggressive.  In gentle characters, where devoutness is intense\nand the intellect feeble, we have an imaginative absorption in\nthe love of God to the exclusion of all practical human\ninterests, which, though innocent enough, is too one-sided to be\nadmirable.  A mind too narrow has room but for one kind of\naffection.  When the love of God takes possession of such a mind,\nit expels all human loves and human uses.  There is no English\nname for such a sweet excess of devotion, so I will refer to it\nas a theopathic condition.",

        "“To be loved here upon the earth,” her recent biographer\nexclaims:  “to be loved by a noble, elevated, distinguished\nbeing; to be loved with fidelity, with devotion–what\nenchantment! But to be loved by God! and loved by him to\ndistraction [aime jusqu’a la folie]!–Margaret melted away with\nlove at the thought of such a thing.  Like Saint Philip of Neri\nin former times, or like Saint Francis Xavier, she said to God: \n’Hold back, O my God, these torrents which overwhelm me, or else\nenlarge my capacity for their reception.\"[202]",

        "The most signal proofs of God’s love which Margaret Mary received\nwere her hallucinations of sight, touch, and hearing, and the\nmost signal in turn of these were the revelations of Christ’s\nsacred heart, “surrounded with rays more brilliant than the Sun,\nand transparent like a crystal.  The wound which he received on\nthe cross visibly appeared upon it.  There was a crown of thorns\nround about this divine Heart, and a cross above it.”  At the\nsame time Christ’s voice told her that, unable longer to contain\nthe flames of his love for mankind, he had chosen her by a\nmiracle to spread the knowledge of them.  He thereupon took out\nher mortal heart, placed it inside of his own and inflamed it,\nand then replaced it in her breast, adding:  “Hitherto thou hast\ntaken the name of my slave, hereafter thou shalt be called the\nwell-beloved disciple of my Sacred Heart.”",
        "In a later vision the Saviour revealed to her in detail the\n\"great design” which he wished to establish through her\ninstrumentality.  “I ask of thee to bring it about that every\nfirst Friday after the week of holy Sacrament shall be made into\na special holy day for honoring my Heart by a general communion\nand by services intended to make honorable amends for the\nindignities which it has received.  And I promise thee that my\nHeart will dilate to shed with abundance the influences of its\nlove upon all those who pay to it these honors, or who bring it\nabout that others do the same.”",
        "“This revelation,” says Mgr. Bougaud, “is unquestionably the most\nimportant of all the revelations which have illumined the Church\nsince that of the Incarnation and of the Lord’s Supper. . . . \nAfter the Eucharist, the supreme effort of the Sacred\nHeart.\"[203]  Well, what were its good fruits for Margaret Mary’s\nlife?  Apparently little else but sufferings and prayers and\nabsences of mind and swoons and ecstasies.  She became\nincreasingly useless about the convent, her absorption in\nChrist’s love–",
        "“which grew upon her daily, rendering her more and more incapable\nof attending to external duties.  They tried her in the\ninfirmary, but without much success, although her kindness, zeal,\nand devotion were without bounds, and her charity rose to acts of\nsuch a heroism that our readers would not bear the recital of\nthem.  They tried her in the kitchen, but were forced to give it\nup as hopeless–everything dropped out of her hands.  The\nadmirable humility with which she made amends for her clumsiness\ncould not prevent this from being prejudicial to the order and\nregularity which must always reign in a community. They put her\nin the school, where the little girls cherished her, and cut\npieces out of her clothes [for relics] as if she were already a\nsaint, but where she was too absorbed inwardly to pay the\nnecessary attention.

        "Poor dear sister, indeed! Amiable and good, but so feeble of\nintellectual outlook that it would be too much to ask of us, with\nour Protestant and modern education, to feel anything but\nindulgent pity for the kind of saintship which she embodies.  A\nlower example still of theopathic saintliness is that of Saint\nGertrude, a Benedictine nun of the thirteenth century, whose\n\"Revelations,” a well-known mystical authority, consist mainly of\nproofs of Christ’s partiality for her undeserving person. \nAssurances of his love, intimacies and caresses and compliments\nof the most absurd and puerile sort, addressed by Christ to\nGertrude as an individual, form the tissue of this paltry-minded\nrecital.[205] In reading such a narrative, we realize the gap\nbetween the thirteenth and the twentieth century, and we feel\nthat saintliness of character may yield almost absolutely\nworthless fruits if it be associated with such inferior\nintellectual sympathies.  What with science, idealism, and\ndemocracy, our own imagination has grown to need a God of an\nentirely different temperament from that Being interested\nexclusively in dealing out personal favors, with whom our\nancestors were so contented.  Smitten as we are with the vision\nof social righteousness, a God indifferent to everything but\nadulation, and full of partiality for his individual favorites,\nlacks an essential element of largeness; and even the best\nprofessional sainthood of former centuries, pent in as it is to\nsuch a conception, seems to us curiously shallow and unedifying.",
        "[205] Examples:  “Suffering from a headache, she sought, for the\nglory of God, to relieve herself by holding certain odoriferous\nsubstances in her mouth, when the Lord appeared to her to lean\nover towards her lovingly, and to find comfort Himself in these\nodors.  After having gently breathed them in, He arose, and said\nwith a gratified air to the Saints, as if contented with what He\nhad done: ’see the new present which my betrothed has given Me!’",
        "“One day, at chapel, she heard supernaturally sung the words\n’Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus.’ The son of God leaning towards her\nlike a sweet lover, and giving to her soul the softest kiss, said\nto her at the second Sanctus:  ’In this Sanctus addressed to my\nperson, receive with this kiss all the sanctity of my divinity\nand of my humanity, and let it be to thee a sufficient\npreparation for approaching the communion table.’ And the next\nfollowing Sunday, while she was thanking God for this favor,\nbehold the Son of God, more beauteous than thousands of angels,\ntakes her in His arms as if He were proud of her and presents her\nto God the Father, in that perfection of sanctity with which He\nhad dowered her.  And the Father took such delight in this soul\nthus presented by His only son, that, as if unable longer to\nrestrain Himself, He gave her, and the Holy Ghost gave her also,\nthe sanctity attributed to each by His own Sanctus–and thus she\nremained endowed with the plenary fullness of the blessing of\nSanctity, bestowed on her by Omnipotence, by Wisdom, and by\nLove.”  Revelations de Sainte Gertrude, Paris, 1898, i. 44, 186.",
        "Take Saint Teresa, for example, one of the ablest women, in many\nrespects, of whose life we have the record.  She had a powerful\nintellect of the practical order.

She was tenaciously aspiring,\nand put her whole life at the service of her religious ideals. \nYet so paltry were these, according to our present way of\nthinking, that (although I know that others have been moved\ndifferently) I confess that my only feeling in reading her has\nbeen pity that so much vitality of soul should have found such\npoor employment.",
        "In spite of the sufferings which she endured, there is a curious\nflavor of superficiality about her genius.  A Birmingham\nanthropologist, Dr. Jordan, has divided the human race into two\ntypes, whom he calls “shrews” and “nonshrews” respectively.[206]\nThe shrew-type is defined as possessing an “active unimpassioned\ntemperament.”  In other words, shrews are the “motors,” rather\nthan the “sensories,\"[207] and their expressions are as a rule\nmore energetic than the feelings which appear to prompt them. \nSaint Teresa, paradoxical as such a judgment may sound, was a\ntypical shrew, in this sense of the term.  The bustle of her\nstyle, as well as of her life, proves it.  Not only must she\nreceive unheard-of personal favors and spiritual graces from her\nSaviour, but she must immediately write about them and exploiter\nthem professionally, and use her expertness to give instruction\nto those less privileged.  Her voluble egotism; her sense, not of\nradical bad being, as the really contrite have it, but of her\n\"faults” and “imperfections” in the plural; her stereotyped\nhumility and return upon herself, as covered with “confusion” at\neach new manifestation of God’s singular partiality for a person\nso unworthy, are typical of shrewdom:  a paramountly feeling\nnature would be objectively lost in gratitude, and silent.  She\nhad some public instincts, it is true; she hated the Lutherans,\nand longed for the church’s triumph over them; but in the main\nher idea of religion seems to have been that of an endless\namatory flirtation–if one may say so without irreverence–\nbetween the devotee and the deity; and apart from helping younger\nnuns to go in this direction by the inspiration of her example\nand instruction, there is absolutely no human use in her, or sign\nof any general human interest.  Yet the spirit of her age, far\nfrom rebuking her, exalted her as superhuman.",

        "We have to pass a similar judgment on the whole notion of\nsaintship based on merits.  Any God who, on the one hand, can\ncare to keep a pedantically minute account of individual\nshortcomings, and on the other can feel such partialities, and\nload particular creatures with such insipid marks of favor, is\ntoo small-minded a God for our credence.  When Luther, in his\nimmense manly way, swept off by a stroke of his hand the very\nnotion of a debit and credit account kept with individuals by the\nAlmighty, he stretched the soul’s imagination and saved theology\nfrom puerility.\n \nSo much for mere devotion, divorced from the intellectual\nconceptions which might guide it towards bearing useful human\nfruit.",
        "The next saintly virtue in which we find excess is Purity.  In\ntheopathic characters, like those whom we have just considered,\nthe love of God must not be mixed with any other love.  Father\nand mother, sisters, brothers, and friends are felt as\ninterfering distractions; for sensitiveness and narrowness, when\nthey occur together, as they often do, require above all things a\nsimplified world to dwell in.  Variety and confusion are too much\nfor their powers of comfortable adaptation.  But whereas your\naggressive pietist reaches his unity objectively, by forcibly\nstamping disorder and divergence out, your retiring pietist\nreaches his subjectively, leaving disorder in the world at large,\nbut making a smaller world in which he dwells himself and from\nwhich he eliminates it altogether.  Thus, alongside of the church\nmilitant with its prisons, dragonnades, and inquisition methods,\nwe have the church fugient, as one might call it, with its\nhermitages, monasteries, and sectarian organizations, both\nchurches pursuing the same object–to unify the life,[208] and\nsimplify the spectacle presented to the soul.  A mind extremely\nsensitive to inner discords will drop one external relation after\nanother, as interfering with the absorption of consciousness in\nspiritual things.  Amusements must go first, then conventional\n\"society,” then business, then family duties, until at last\nseclusion, with a subdivision of the day into hours for stated\nreligious acts, is the only thing that can be borne.  The lives\nof saints are a history of successive renunciations of\ncomplication, one form of contact with the outer life being\ndropped after another, to save the purity of inner tone.[209] \n\"Is it not better,” a young sister asks her Superior, “that I\nshould not speak at all during the hour of recreation, so as not\nto run the risk, by speaking, of falling into some sin of which I\nmight not be conscious?\"[210]  If the life remains a social one\nat all, those who take part in it must follow one identical rule.",
        "Embosomed in this monotony, the zealot for purity feels clean and\nfree once more.  The minuteness of uniformity maintained in\ncertain sectarian communities, whether monastic or not, is\nsomething almost inconceivable to a man of the world.  Costume,\nphraseology, hours, and habits are absolutely stereotyped, and\nthere is no doubt that some persons are so made as to find in\nthis stability an incomparable kind of mental rest.",
        "[208] On this subject I refer to the work of M. Murisier (Les\nMaladies du sentiment Religieux, Paris, 1901), who makes inner\nunification the mainspring of the whole religious life.  But ALL\nstrongly ideal interests, religious or irreligious, unify the\nmind and tend to subordinate everything to themselves.  One would\ninfer from M. Murisier’s pages that this formal condition was\npeculiarly characteristic of religion, and that one might in\ncomparison almost neglect material content, in studying the\nlatter.  I trust that the present work will convince the reader\nthat religion has plenty of material content which is\ncharacteristic and which is more important by far than any\ngeneral psychological form.  In spite of this criticism, I find\nM. Murisier’s book highly instructive.",

The first circle was his cell, his chapel, and the\nchoir.  When he was within this circle, he seemed to himself in\ncomplete security.  The second circle was the whole monastery as\nfar as the outer gate.  The third and outermost circle was the\ngate itself, and here it was necessary for him to stand well upon\nhis guard.  When he went outside these circles, it seemed to him\nthat he was in the plight of some wild animal which is outside\nits hole, and surrounded by the hunt, and therefore in need of\nall its cunning and watchfulness.”  The Life of the Blessed Henry\nSuso, by Himself, translated by Knox, London, 1865, p. 168.",

        "I think you will agree that this youth carried the elimination of\nthe external and discordant to a point which we cannot\nunreservedly admire.  At the age of ten, his biographer says:–",
        "“The inspiration came to him to consecrate to the Mother of God\nhis own virginity–that being to her the most agreeable of\npossible presents.  Without delay, then, and with all the fervor\nthere was in him, joyous of heart, and burning with love, he made\nhis vow of perpetual chastity.  Mary accepted the offering of his\ninnocent heart, and obtained for him from God, as a recompense,\nthe extraordinary grace of never feeling during his entire life\nthe slightest touch of temptation against the virtue of purity. \nThis was an altogether exceptional favor, rarely accorded even to\nSaints themselves, and all the more marvelous in that Louis dwelt\nalways in courts and among great folks, where danger and\nopportunity are so unusually frequent.  It is true that Louis\nfrom his earliest childhood had shown a natural repugnance for\nwhatever might be impure or unvirginal, and even for relations of\nany sort whatever between persons of opposite sex.  But this made\nit all the more surprising that he should, especially since this\nvow, feel it necessary to have recourse to such a number of\nexpedients for protecting against even the shadow of danger the\nvirginity which he had thus consecrated.  One might suppose that\nif any one could have contented himself with the ordinary\nprecautions, prescribed for all Christians, it would assuredly\nhave been he.  But no! In the use of preservatives and means of\ndefense, in flight from the most insignificant occasions, from\nevery possibility of peril, just as in the mortification of his\nflesh, he went farther than the majority of saints.  He, who by\nan extraordinary protection of God’s grace was never tempted,\nmeasured all his steps as if he were threatened on every side by\nparticular dangers.  Thenceforward he never raised his eyes,\neither when walking in the streets, or when in society.  Not only\ndid he avoid all business with females even more scrupulously\nthan before, but he renounced all conversation and every kind of\nsocial recreation with them, although his father tried to make\nhim take part; and he commenced only too early to deliver his\ninnocent body to austerities of every kind.\"[211]",

Several great ladies,\nrelatives of his, he avoided learning to know even by sight; and\nhe made a sort of treaty with his father, engaging promptly and\nreadily to accede to all his wishes, if he might only be excused\nfrom all visits to ladies.” [212]",

        "When he was seventeen years old Louis joined the Jesuit\norder,[213] against his father’s passionate entreaties, for he\nwas heir of a princely house; and when a year later the father\ndied, he took the loss as a “particular attention” to himself on\nGod’s part, and wrote letters of stilted good advice, as from a\nspiritual superior, to his grieving mother.  He soon became so\ngood a monk that if any one asked him the number of his brothers\nand sisters, he had to reflect and count them over before\nreplying.  A Father asked him one day if he were never troubled\nby the thought of his family, to which, “I never think of them\nexcept when praying for them,” was his only answer.  Never was he\nseen to hold in his hand a flower or anything perfumed, that he\nmight take pleasure in it.  On the contrary, in the hospital, he\nused to seek for whatever was most disgusting, and eagerly snatch\nthe bandages of ulcers, etc., from the hands of his companions. \nHe avoided worldly talk, and immediately tried to turn every\nconversation on to pious subjects, or else he remained silent. \nHe systematically refused to notice his surroundings.  Being\nordered one day to bring a book from the rector’s seat in the\nrefectory, he had to ask where the rector sat, for in the three\nmonths he had eaten bread there, so carefully did he guard his\neyes that he had not noticed the place.  One day, during recess,\nhaving looked by chance on one of his companions, he reproached\nhimself as for a grave sin against modesty.  He cultivated\nsilence, as preserving from sins of the tongue; and his greatest\npenance was the limit which his superiors set to his bodily\npenances.  He sought after false accusations and unjust\nreprimands as opportunities of humility; and such was his\nobedience that, when a room-mate, having no more paper, asked him\nfor a sheet, he did not feel free to give it to him without first\nobtaining the permission of the superior, who, as such, stood in\nthe place of God, and transmitted his orders.",

        "I cannot resist the temptation to quote from Starbuck’s book, p.\n388, another case of purification by elimination.  It runs as\nfollows:–",
        "“The signs of abnormality which sanctified persons show are of\nfrequent occurrence.  They get out of tune with other people;\noften they will have nothing to do with churches, which they\nregard as worldly; they become hypercritical towards others; they\ngrow careless of their social, political, and financial\nobligations.  As an instance of this type may be mentioned a\nwoman of sixty-eight of whom the writer made a special study. \nShe had been a member of one of the most active and progressive\nchurches in a busy part of a large city.  Her pastor described\nher as having reached the censorious stage.  She had grown more\nand more out of sympathy with the church; her connection with it\nfinally consisted simply in attendance at prayer-meeting, at\nwhich her only message was that of reproof and condemnation of\nthe others for living on a low plane.  At last she withdrew from\nfellowship with any church.  The writer found her living alone in\na little room on the top story of a cheap boarding-house quite\nout of touch with all human relations, but apparently happy in\nthe enjoyment of her own spiritual blessings.  Her time was\noccupied in writing booklets on sanctification–page after page\nof dreamy rhapsody.  She proved to be one of a small group of\npersons who claim that entire salvation involves three steps\ninstead of two; not only must there be conversion and\nsanctification, but a third, which they call ’crucifixion’ or\n’perfect redemption,’ and which seems to bear the same relation\nto sanctification that this bears to conversion.  She related how\nthe Spirit had said to her, ’Stop going to church.  Stop going to\nholiness meetings.  Go to your own room and I will teach you.’\nShe professes to care nothing for colleges, or preachers, or\nchurches, but only cares to listen to what God says to her.  Her\ndescription of her experience seemed entirely consistent; she is\nhappy and contented, and her life is entirely satisfactory to\nherself.  While listening to her own story, one was tempted to\nforget that it was from the life of a person who could not live\nby it in conjunction with her fellows.”",
        "Our final judgment of the worth of such a life as this will\ndepend largely on our conception of God, and of the sort of\nconduct he is best pleased with in his creatures.  The\nCatholicism of the sixteenth century paid little heed to social\nrighteousness; and to leave the world to the devil whilst saving\none’s own soul was then accounted no discreditable scheme. \nTo-day, rightly or wrongly, helpfulness in general human affairs\nis, in consequence of one of those secular mutations in moral\nsentiment of which I spoke, deemed an essential element of worth\nin character; and to be of some public or private use is also\nreckoned as a species of divine service.  Other early Jesuits,\nespecially the missionaries among them, the Xaviers, Brebeufs,\nJogues, were objective minds, and fought in their way for the\nworld’s welfare; so their lives to-day inspire us.  But when the\nintellect, as in this Louis, is originally no larger than a pin’s\nhead, and cherishes ideas of God of corresponding smallness, the\nresult, notwithstanding the heroism put forth, is on the whole\nrepulsive.  Purity, we see in the object-lesson, is NOT the one\nthing needful; and it is better that a life should contract many\na dirt-mark, than forfeit usefulness in its efforts to remain\nunspotted.",
        "Proceeding onwards in our search of religious extravagance, we\nnext come upon excesses of Tenderness and Charity.  Here\nsaintliness has to face the charge of preserving the unfit, and\nbreeding parasites and beggars.  “Resist not evil,” “Love your\nenemies,” these are saintly maxims of which men of this world\nfind it hard to speak without impatience. Are the men of this\nworld right, or are the saints in possession of the deeper range\nof truth?",
        "No simple answer is possible.  Here, if anywhere, one feels the\ncomplexity of the moral life, and the mysteriousness of the way\nin which facts and ideals are interwoven.",
        "Perfect conduct is a relation between three terms:  the actor,\nthe objects for which he acts, and the recipients of the action. \nIn order that conduct should be abstractly perfect, all three\nterms, intention, execution, and reception, should be suited to\none another.  The best intention will fail if it either work by\nfalse means or address itself to the wrong recipient.  Thus no\ncritic or estimator of the value of conduct can confine himself\nto the actor’s animus alone, apart from the other elements of the\nperformance.  As there is no worse lie than a truth misunderstood\nby those who hear it, so reasonable arguments, challenges to\nmagnanimity, and appeals to sympathy or justice, are folly when\nwe are dealing with human crocodiles and boa-constrictors.  The\nsaint may simply give the universe into the hands of the enemy by\nhis trustfulness.  He may by non-resistance cut off his own\nsurvival.",
        "Herbert Spencer tells us that the perfect man’s conduct will\nappear perfect only when the environment is perfect:  to no\ninferior environment is it suitably adapted.  We may paraphrase\nthis by cordially admitting that saintly conduct would be the\nmost perfect conduct conceivable in an environment where all were\nsaints already; but by adding that in an environment where few\nare saints, and many the exact reverse of saints, it must be ill\nadapted.  We must frankly confess, then, using our empirical\ncommon sense and ordinary practical prejudices, that in the world\nthat actually is, the virtues of sympathy, charity, and\nnon-resistance may be, and often have been, manifested in excess.",
        "The powers of darkness have systematically taken advantage of\nthem.  The whole modern scientific organization of charity is a\nconsequence of the failure of simply giving alms.  The whole\nhistory of constitutional government is a commentary on the\nexcellence of resisting evil, and when one cheek is smitten, of\nsmiting back and not turning the other cheek also.",
        "You will agree to this in general, for in spite of the Gospel, in\nspite of Quakerism, in spite of Tolstoi, you believe in fighting\nfire with fire, in shooting down usurpers, locking up thieves,\nand freezing out vagabonds and swindlers.",
        "And yet you are sure, as I am sure, that were the world confined\nto these hard-headed, hard-hearted, and hard-fisted methods\nexclusively, were there no one prompt to help a brother first,\nand find out afterwards whether he were worthy; no one willing to\ndrown his private wrongs in pity for the wronger’s person; no one\nready to be duped many a time rather than live always on\nsuspicion; no one glad to treat individuals passionately and\nimpulsively rather than by general rules of prudence; the world\nwould be an infinitely worse place than it is now to live in. \nThe tender grace, not of a day that is dead, but of a day yet to\nbe born somehow, with the golden rule grown natural, would be cut\nout from the perspective of our imaginations.",
        "The saints, existing in this way, may, with their extravagances\nof human tenderness, be prophetic.  Nay, innumerable times they\nhave proved themselves prophetic.  Treating those whom they met,\nin spite of the past, in spite of all appearances, as worthy,\nthey have stimulated them to BE worthy, miraculously transformed\nthem by their radiant example and by the challenge of their\nexpectation.",
        "From this point of view we may admit the human charity which we\nfind in all saints, and the great excess of it which we find in\nsome saints, to be a genuinely creative social force, tending to\nmake real a degree of virtue which it alone is ready to assume as\npossible.  The saints are authors, auctores, increasers, of\ngoodness.  The potentialities of development in human souls are\nunfathomable.  So many who seemed irretrievably hardened have in\npoint of fact been softened, converted, regenerated, in ways that\namazed the subjects even more than they surprised the spectators,\nthat we never can be sure in advance of any man that his\nsalvation by the way of love is hopeless.  We have no right to\nspeak of human crocodiles and boa-constrictors as of fixedly\nincurable beings.  We know not the complexities of personality,\nthe smouldering emotional fires, the other facets of the\ncharacter-polyhedron, the resources of the subliminal region. \nSt. Paul long ago made our ancestors familiar with the idea that\nevery soul is virtually sacred.  Since Christ died for us all\nwithout exception, St. Paul said, we must despair of no one. \nThis belief in the essential sacredness of every one expresses\nitself to-day in all sorts of humane customs and reformatory\ninstitutions, and in a growing aversion to the death penalty and\nto brutality in punishment.  The saints, with their extravagance\nof human tenderness, are the great torch-bearers of this belief,\nthe tip of the wedge, the clearers of the darkness.  Like the\nsingle drops which sparkle in the sun as they are flung far ahead\nof the advancing edge of a wave-crest or of a flood, they show\nthe way and are forerunners.  The world is not yet with them, so\nthey often seem in the midst of the world’s affairs to be\npreposterous.  Yet they are impregnators of the world, vivifiers\nand animaters of potentialities of goodness which but for them\nwould lie forever dormant.  It is not possible to be quite as\nmean as we naturally are, when they have passed before us.  One\nfire kindles another; and without that over-trust in human worth\nwhich they show, the rest of us would lie in spiritual stagnancy.",
        "Momentarily considered, then, the saint may waste his tenderness\nand be the dupe and victim of his charitable fever, but the\ngeneral function of his charity in social evolution is vital and\nessential.  If things are ever to move upward, some one must be\nready to take the first step, and assume the risk of it.  No one\nwho is not willing to try charity, to try non-resistance as the\nsaint is always willing, can tell whether these methods will or\nwill not succeed.  When they do succeed, they are far more\npowerfully successful than force or worldly prudence.  Force\ndestroys enemies; and the best that can be said of prudence is\nthat it keeps what we already have in safety.  But\nnon-resistance, when successful, turns enemies into friends; and\ncharity regenerates its objects.  These saintly methods are, as I\nsaid, creative energies; and genuine saints find in the elevated\nexcitement with which their faith endows them an authority and\nimpressiveness which makes them irresistible in situations where\nmen of shallower nature cannot get on at all without the use of\nworldly prudence.  This practical proof that worldly wisdom may\nbe safely transcended is the saint’s magic gift to mankind.[215]\nNot only does his vision of a better world console us for the\ngenerally prevailing prose and barrenness; but even when on the\nwhole we have to confess him ill adapted, he makes some converts,\nand the environment gets better for his ministry.  He is an\neffective ferment of goodness, a slow transmuter of the earthly\ninto a more heavenly order.",
        "[215]  The best missionary lives abound in the victorious\ncombination of non-resistance with personal authority.  John G. \nPaton, for example, in the New Hebrides, among brutish Melanesian\ncannibals, preserves a charmed life by dint of it.  When it comes\nto the point, no one ever dares actually to strike him.  Native\nconverts, inspired by him, showed analogous virtue.  “One of our\nchiefs, full of the Christ-kindled desire to seek and to save,\nsent a message to an inland chief, that he and four attendants\nwould come on Sabbath and tell them the gospel of Jehovah God. \nThe reply came back sternly forbidding their visit, and\nthreatening with death any Christian that approached their\nvillage.  Our chief sent in response a loving message, telling\nthem that Jehovah had taught the Christians to return good for\nevil, and that they would come unarmed to tell them the story of\nhow the Son of God came into the world and died in order to bless\nand save his enemies.  The heathen chief sent back a stern and\nprompt reply once more:  ’If you come, you will be killed.’ On\nSabbath morn the Christian chief and his four companions were met\noutside the village by the heathen chief, who implored and\nthreatened them once more. But the former said:–",
        "“’We come to you without weapons of war! We come only to tell\nyou about Jesus.  We believe that He will protect us to-day.’",
        "“As they pressed steadily forward towards the village, spears\nbegan to be thrown at them.  Some they evaded, being all except\none dexterous warriors; and others they literally received with\ntheir bare hands, and turned them aside in an incredible manner. \nThe heathen, apparently thunderstruck at these men thus\napproaching them without weapons of war, and not even flinging\nback their own spears which they had caught, after having thrown\nwhat the old chief called ’a shower of spears,’ desisted from\nmere surprise.  Our Christian chief called out, as he and his\ncompanions drew up in the midst of them on the village public\nground:–",
        "“’Jehovah thus protects us.  He has given us all your spears!\nOnce we would have thrown them back at you and killed you.  But\nnow we come, not to fight but to tell you about Jesus.  He has\nchanged our dark hearts.  He asks you now to lay down all these\nyour other weapons of war, and to hear what we can tell you about\nthe love of God, our great Father, the only living God.’",
        "“The heathen were perfectly overawed.  They manifestly looked on\nthese Christians as protected by some Invisible One.  They\nlistened for the first time to the story of the Gospel and of the\nCross.  We lived to see that chief and all his tribe sitting in\nthe school of Christ.  And there is perhaps not an island in\nthese southern seas, amongst all those won for Christ, where\nsimilar acts of heroism on the part of converts cannot be\nrecited.”   John G. Paton, Missionary to the New Hebrides, An\nAutobiography, second part, London, 1890, p. 243.",
        "In this respect the Utopian dreams of social justice in which\nmany contemporary socialists and anarchists indulge are, in spite\nof their impracticability and non-adaptation to present\nenvironmental conditions, analogous to the saint’s belief in an\nexistent kingdom of heaven.  They help to break the edge of the\ngeneral reign of hardness and are slow leavens of a better order.",
        "The next topic in order is Asceticism, which I fancy you are all\nready to consider without argument a virtue liable to\nextravagance and excess.  The optimism and refinement of the\nmodern imagination has, as I have already said elsewhere, changed\nthe attitude of the church towards corporeal mortification, and a\nSuso or a Saint Peter of Alcantara[216] appear to us to-day\nrather in the light of tragic mountebanks than of sane men\ninspiring us with respect.  If the inner dispositions are right,\nwe ask, what need of all this torment, this violation of the\nouter nature?  It keeps the outer nature too important.  Any one\nwho is genuinely emancipated from the flesh will look on\npleasures and pains, abundance and privation, as alike irrelevant\nand indifferent.  He can engage in actions and experience\nenjoyments without fear of corruption or enslavement.  As the\nBhagavad-Gita says, only those need renounce worldly actions who\nare still inwardly attached thereto.  If one be really unattached\nto the fruits of action, one may mix in the world with\nequanimity.  I quoted in a former lecture Saint Augustine’s\nantinomian saying:  If you only love God enough, you may safely\nfollow all your inclinations.  “He needs no devotional\npractices,” is one of Ramakrishna’s maxims, “whose heart is moved\nto tears at the mere mention of the name of <354> Hari.\"[217] \nAnd the Buddha, in pointing out what he called “the middle way\"\nto his disciples, told them to abstain from both extremes,\nexcessive mortification being as unreal and unworthy as mere\ndesire and pleasure.  The only perfect life, he said, is that of\ninner wisdom, which makes one thing as indifferent to us as\nanother, and thus leads to rest, to peace, and to Nirvana.[218]",
        "[216] Saint Peter, Saint Teresa tells us in her autobiography\n(French translation, p. 333), “had passed forty years without\never sleeping more than an hour and a half a day.  Of all his\nmortifications, this was the one that had cost him the most.  To\ncompass it, he kept always on his knees or on his feet.  The\nlittle sleep he allowed nature to take was snatched in a sitting\nposture, his head leaning against a piece of wood fixed in the\nwall.  Even had he wished to lie down, it would have been\nimpossible, because his cell was only four feet and a half long. \nIn the course of all these years he never raised his hood, no\nmatter what the ardor of the sun or the rain’s strength.  He\nnever put on a shoe.  He wore a garment of coarse sackcloth, with\nnothing else upon his skin.  This garment was as scant as\npossible, and over it a little cloak of the same stuff.  When the\ncold was great he took off the cloak and opened for a while the\ndoor and little window of his cell.  Then he closed them and\nresumed the mantle–his way, as he told us, of warming himself,\nand making his body feel a better temperature.  It was a frequent\nthing with him to eat once only in three days; and when I\nexpressed my surprise, he said that it was very easy if one once\nhad acquired the habit.  One of his companions has assured me\nthat he has gone sometimes eight days without food. . . . His\npoverty was extreme; and his mortification, even in his youth,\nwas such that he told me he had passed three years in a house of\nhis order without knowing any of the monks otherwise than by the\nsound of their voice, for he never raised his eyes, and only\nfound his way about by following the others.  He showed this same\nmodesty on public highways.  He spent many years without ever\nlaying eyes upon a woman; but he confessed to me that at the age\nhe had reached it was indifferent to him whether he laid eyes on\nthem or not.  He was very old when I first came to know him, and\nhis body so attenuated that it seemed formed of nothing so much\nas of so many roots of trees. With all this sanctity he was very\naffable.  He never spoke unless he was questioned, but his\nintellectual right-mindedness and grace gave to all his words an\nirresistible charm.”",

        "We find accordingly that as ascetic saints have grown older, and\ndirectors of conscience more experienced, they usually have shown\na tendency to lay less stress on special bodily mortifications. \nCatholic teachers have always professed the rule that, since\nhealth is needed for efficiency in God’s service, health must not\nbe sacrificed to mortification.  The general optimism and\nhealthy-mindedness of liberal Protestant circles to-day makes\nmortification for mortification’s sake repugnant to us.  We can\nno longer sympathize with cruel deities, and the notion that God\ncan take delight in the spectacle of sufferings self-inflicted in\nhis honor is abhorrent.  In consequence of all these motives you\nprobably are disposed, unless some special utility can be shown\nin some individual’s discipline, to treat the general tendency to\nasceticism as pathological.",
        "Yet I believe that a more careful consideration of the whole\nmatter, distinguishing between the general good intention of\nasceticism and the uselessness of some of the particular acts of\nwhich it may be guilty, ought to rehabilitate it in our esteem. \nFor in its spiritual meaning asceticism stands for nothing less\nthan for the essence of the twice-born philosophy.  It\nsymbolizes, lamely enough no doubt, but sincerely, the belief\nthat there is an element of real wrongness in this world, which\nis neither to be ignored nor evaded, but which must be squarely\nmet and overcome by an appeal to the soul’s heroic resources, and\nneutralized and cleansed away by suffering.  As against this\nview, the ultra-optimistic form of the once-born philosophy\nthinks we may treat evil by the method of ignoring.  Let a man\nwho, by fortunate health and circumstances, escapes the suffering\nof any great amount of evil in his own person, also close his\neyes to it as it exists in the wider universe outside his private\nexperience, and he will be quit of it altogether, and can sail\nthrough life happily on a healthy-minded basis.  But we saw in\nour lectures on melancholy how precarious this attempt\nnecessarily is.  Moreover it is but for the individual; and\nleaves the evil outside of him, unredeemed and unprovided for in\nhis philosophy.",
        "No such attempt can be a GENERAL solution of the problem; and to\nminds of sombre tinge, who naturally feel life as a tragic\nmystery, such optimism is a shallow dodge or mean evasion.  It\naccepts, in lieu of a real deliverance, what is a lucky personal\naccident merely, a cranny to escape by. It leaves the general\nworld unhelped and still in the clutch of Satan.  The real\ndeliverance, the twice-born folk insist, must be of universal\napplication.  Pain and wrong and death must be fairly met and\novercome in higher excitement, or else their sting remains\nessentially unbroken.  If one has ever taken the fact of the\nprevalence of tragic death in this world’s history fairly into\nhis mind–freezing, drowning entombment alive, wild beasts, worse\nmen, and hideous diseases–he can with difficulty, it seems to\nme, continue his own career of worldly prosperity without\nsuspecting that he may all the while not be really inside the\ngame, that he may lack the great initiation.",
        "Well, this is exactly what asceticism thinks; and it voluntarily\ntakes the initiation.  Life is neither farce nor genteel comedy,\nit says, but something we must sit at in mourning garments,\nhoping its bitter taste will purge us of our folly. The wild and\nthe heroic are indeed such rooted parts of it that\nhealthy-mindedness pure and simple, with its sentimental\noptimism, can hardly be regarded by any thinking man as a serious\nsolution.  Phrases of neatness, cosiness, and comfort can never\nbe an answer to the sphinx’s riddle.",
        "In these remarks I am leaning only upon mankind’s common instinct\nfor reality, which in point of fact has always held the world to\nbe essentially a theatre for heroism.  In heroism, we feel,\nlife’s supreme mystery is hidden.  We tolerate no one who has no\ncapacity whatever for it in any direction.  On the other hand, no\nmatter what a man’s frailties otherwise may be, if he be willing\nto risk death, and still more if he suffer it heroically, in the\nservice he has chosen, the fact consecrates him forever. \nInferior to ourselves in this or that way, if yet we cling to\nlife, and he is able “to fling it away like a flower” as caring\nnothing for it, we account him in the deepest way our born\nsuperior.  Each of us in his own person feels that a high-hearted\nindifference to life would expiate all his shortcomings.",
        "The metaphysical mystery, thus recognized by common sense, that\nhe who feeds on death that feeds on men possesses life\nsupereminently and excellently, and meets best the secret demands\nof the universe, is the truth of which asceticism has been the\nfaithful champion.  The folly of the cross, so inexplicable by\nthe intellect, has yet its indestructible vital meaning.",
        "Representatively, then, and symbolically, and apart from the\nvagaries into which the unenlightened intellect of former times\nmay have let it wander, asceticism must, I believe, be\nacknowledged to go with the profounder way of handling the gift\nof existence.  Naturalistic optimism is mere syllabub and\nflattery and sponge-cake in comparison. The practical course of\naction for us, as religious men, would therefore, it seems to me,\nnot be simply to turn our backs upon the ascetic impulse, as most\nof us to-day turn them, but rather to discover some outlet for it\nof which the fruits in the way of privation and hardship might be\nobjectively useful.  The older monastic asceticism occupied\nitself with pathetic futilities, or terminated in the mere\negotism of the individual, increasing his own perfection.[219] \nBut is it not possible for us to discard most of these older\nforms of mortification, and yet find saner channels for the\nheroism which inspired them?",

Is not the\nexclusively sympathetic and facetious way in which most children\nare brought up to-day–so different from the education of a\nhundred years ago, especially in evangelical circles–in danger,\nin spite of its many advantages, of developing a certain\ntrashiness of fibre?  Are there not hereabouts some points of\napplication for a renovated and revised ascetic discipline?",
        "Many of you would recognize such dangers, but would point to\nathletics, militarism, and individual and national enterprise and\nadventure as the remedies.  These contemporary ideals are quite\nas remarkable for the energy with which they make for heroic\nstandards of life, as contemporary religion is remarkable for the\nway in which it neglects them.[220]  War and adventure assuredly\nkeep all who engage in them from treating themselves too\ntenderly.  They demand such incredible efforts, depth beyond\ndepth of exertion, both in degree and in duration, that the whole\nscale of motivation alters.  Discomfort and annoyance, hunger and\nwet, pain and cold, squalor and filth, cease to have any\ndeterrent operation whatever.  Death turns into a commonplace\nmatter, and its usual power to check our action vanishes.

        "The beauty of war in this respect is that it is so congruous with\nordinary human nature.

War, and\neven peace, require of the soldier absolutely peculiar standards\nof morality.  The recruit brings with him common moral notions,\nof which he must seek immediately to get rid.  For him victory,\nsuccess, must be EVERYTHING.  The most barbaric tendencies in men\ncome to life again in war, and for war’s uses they are\nincommensurably good.\"[221]",

        "These words are of course literally true.  The immediate aim of\nthe soldier’s life is, as Moltke said, destruction, and nothing\nbut destruction; and whatever constructions wars result in are\nremote and non-military.  Consequently the soldier cannot\ntrain himself to be too feelingless to all those usual sympathies\nand respects, whether for persons or for things, that make for\nconservation.  Yet the fact remains that war is a school of\nstrenuous life and heroism; and, being in the line of aboriginal\ninstinct, is the only school that as yet is universally\navailable.  But when we gravely ask ourselves whether this\nwholesale organization of irrationality and crime be our only\nbulwark against effeminacy, we stand aghast at the thought, and\nthink more kindly of ascetic religion.  One hears of the\nmechanical equivalent of heat.  What we now need to discover in\nthe social realm is the moral equivalent of war:  something\nheroic that will speak to men as universally as war does, and yet\nwill be as compatible with their spiritual selves as war has\nproved itself to be incompatible.  I have often thought that in\nthe old monkish poverty-worship, in spite of the pedantry which\ninfested it, there might be something like that moral equivalent\nof war which we are seeking.  May not voluntarily accepted\npoverty be “the strenuous life,” without the need of crushing\nweaker peoples?",
        "Poverty indeed IS the strenuous life–without brass bands or\nuniforms or hysteric popular applause or lies or circumlocutions;\nand when one sees the way in which wealth- getting enters as an\nideal into the very bone and marrow of our generation, one\nwonders whether a revival of the belief that poverty is a worthy\nreligious vocation may not be “the transformation of military\ncourage,” and the spiritual reform which our time stands most in\nneed of.",
        "Among us English-speaking peoples especially do the praises of\npoverty need once more to be boldly sung.  We have grown\nliterally afraid to be poor.  We despise any one who elects to be\npoor in order to simplify and save his inner life.  If he does\nnot join the general scramble and pant with the money-making\nstreet, we deem him spiritless and lacking in ambition.  We have\nlost the power even of imagining what the ancient idealization of\npoverty could have meant:  the liberation from material\nattachments, the unbribed soul, the manlier indifference, the\npaying our way by what we are or do and not by what we have, the\nright to fling away our life at any moment irresponsibly–the\nmore athletic trim, in short, the moral fighting shape.  When we\nof the so-called better classes are scared as men were never\nscared in history at material ugliness and hardship; when we put\noff marriage until our house can be artistic, and quake at the\nthought of having a child without a bank-account and doomed to\nmanual labor, it is time for thinking men to protest against so\nunmanly and irreligious a state of opinion.",
        "It is true that so far as wealth gives time for ideal ends and\nexercise to ideal energies, wealth is better than poverty and\nought to be chosen.  But wealth does this in only a portion of\nthe actual cases.  Elsewhere the desire to gain wealth and the\nfear to lose it are our chief breeders of cowardice and\npropagators of corruption.  There are thousands of conjunctures\nin which a wealth-bound man must be a slave, whilst a man for\nwhom poverty has no terrors becomes a freeman.  Think of the\nstrength which personal indifference to poverty would give us if\nwe were devoted to unpopular causes.  We need no longer hold our\ntongues or fear to vote the revolutionary or reformatory ticket. \nOur stocks might fall, our hopes of promotion vanish, our\nsalaries stop, our club doors close in our faces; yet, while we\nlived, we would imperturbably bear witness to the spirit, and our\nexample would help to set free our generation.  The cause would\nneed its funds, but we its servants would be potent in proportion\nas we personally were contented with our poverty.",
        "I recommend this matter to your serious pondering, for it is\ncertain that the prevalent fear of poverty among the educated\nclasses is the worst moral disease from which our civilization\nsuffers.",
        "I have now said all that I can usefully say about the several\nfruits of religion as they are manifested in saintly lives, so I\nwill make a brief review and pass to my more general conclusions.",
        "Our question, you will remember, is as to whether religion stands\napproved by its fruits, as these are exhibited in the saintly\ntype of character.  Single attributes of saintliness may, it is\ntrue, be temperamental endowments, found in non-religious\nindividuals.  But the whole group of them forms a combination\nwhich, as such, is religious, for it seems to flow from the sense\nof the divine as from its psychological centre.  Whoever\npossesses strongly this sense comes naturally to think that the\nsmallest details of this world derive infinite significance from\ntheir relation to an unseen divine order.  The thought of this\norder yields him a superior denomination of happiness, and a\nsteadfastness of soul with which no other can compare.  In social\nrelations his serviceability is exemplary; he abounds in impulses\nto help. His help is inward as well as outward, for his sympathy\nreaches souls as well as bodies, and kindles unsuspected\nfaculties therein.  Instead of placing happiness where common men\nplace it, in comfort, he places it in a higher kind of inner\nexcitement, which converts discomforts into sources of cheer and\nannuls unhappiness.  So he turns his back upon no duty, however\nthankless; and when we are in need of assistance, we can count\nupon the saint lending his hand with more certainty than we can\ncount upon any other person.  Finally, his humble-mindedness and\nhis ascetic tendencies save him from the petty personal\npretensions which so obstruct our ordinary social intercourse,\nand his purity gives us in him a clean man for a companion. \nFelicity, purity, charity, patience, self-severity–these are\nsplendid excellencies, and the saint of all men shows them in the\ncompletest possible measure.",
        "But, as we saw, all these things together do not make saints\ninfallible.  When their intellectual outlook is narrow, they fall\ninto all sorts of holy excesses, fanaticism or theopathic\nabsorption, self-torment, prudery, scrupulosity, gullibility, and\nmorbid inability to meet the world.  By the very intensity of his\nfidelity to the paltry ideals with which an inferior intellect\nmay inspire him, a saint can be even more objectionable and\ndamnable than a superficial carnal man would be in the same\nsituation.  We must judge him not sentimentally only, and not in\nisolation, but using our own intellectual standards, placing him\nin his environment, and estimating his total function.",
        "Now in the matter of intellectual standards, we must bear in mind\nthat it is unfair, where we find narrowness of mind, always to\nimpute it as a vice to the individual, for in religious and\ntheological matters he probably absorbs his narrowness from his\ngeneration.  Moreover, we must not confound the essentials of\nsaintliness, which are those general passions of which I have\nspoken, with its accidents, which are the special determinations\nof these passions at any historical moment.  In these\ndeterminations the saints will usually be loyal to the temporary\nidols of their tribe.  Taking refuge in monasteries was as much\nan idol of the tribe in the middle ages, as bearing a hand in the\nworld’s work is to-day.  Saint Francis or Saint Bernard, were\nthey living to-day, would undoubtedly be leading consecrated\nlives of some sort, but quite as undoubtedly they would not lead\nthem in retirement.  Our animosity to special historic\nmanifestations must not lead us to give away the saintly impulses\nin their essential nature to the tender mercies of inimical\ncritics.",
        "The most inimical critic of the saintly impulses whom I know is\nNietzsche.  He contrasts them with the worldly passions as we\nfind these embodied in the predaceous military character,\naltogether to the advantage of the latter.  Your born saint, it\nmust be confessed, has something about him which often makes the\ngorge of a carnal man rise, so it will be worth while to consider\nthe contrast in question more fully.",
        "Dislike of the saintly nature seems to be a negative result of\nthe biologically useful instinct of welcoming leadership, and\nglorifying the chief of the tribe.  The chief is the potential,\nif not the actual tyrant, the masterful, overpowering man of\nprey.  We confess our inferiority and grovel before him.  We\nquail under his glance, and are at the same time proud of owning\nso dangerous a lord.  Such instinctive and submissive\nhero-worship must have been indispensable in primeval tribal\nlife.  In the endless wars of those times, leaders were\nabsolutely needed for the tribe’s survival.  If there were any\ntribes who owned no leaders, they can have left no issue to\nnarrate their doom.  The leaders always had good consciences, for\nconscience in them coalesced with will, and those who looked on\ntheir face were as much smitten with wonder at their freedom from\ninner restraint as with awe at the energy of their outward\nperformances.",
        "Compared with these beaked and taloned graspers of the world,\nsaints are herbivorous animals, tame and harmless barn-yard\npoultry.  There are saints whose beard you may, if you ever care\nto, pull with impunity.  Such a man excites no thrills of wonder\nveiled in terror; his conscience is full of scruples and returns;\nhe stuns us neither by his inward freedom nor his outward power;\nand unless he found within us an altogether different faculty of\nadmiration to appeal to, we should pass him by with contempt.",
        "In point of fact, he does appeal to a different faculty.\nReenacted in human nature is the fable of the wind, the sun, and\nthe traveler.  The sexes embody the discrepancy.  The woman loves\nthe man the more admiringly the stormier he shows himself, and\nthe world deifies its rulers the more for being willful and\nunaccountable.  But the woman in turn subjugates the man by the\nmystery of gentleness in beauty, and the saint has always charmed\nthe world by something similar.  Mankind is susceptible and\nsuggestible in opposite directions, and the rivalry of influences\nis unsleeping.  The saintly and the worldly ideal pursue their\nfeud in literature as much as in real life.",
        "For Nietzsche the saint represents little but sneakingness and\nslavishness.  He is the sophisticated invalid, the degenerate par\nexcellence, the man of insufficient vitality.  His prevalence\nwould put the human type in danger.",
        "“The sick are the greatest danger for the well.  The weaker, not\nthe stronger, are the strong’s undoing.  It is not FEAR of our\nfellow-man, which we should wish to see diminished; for fear\nrouses those who are strong to become terrible in turn\nthemselves, and preserves the hard-earned and successful type of\nhumanity. What is to be dreaded by us more than any other doom is\nnot fear, but rather the great disgust, not fear, but rather the\ngreat pity–disgust and pity for our human fellows. . . .  The\nMORBID are our greatest peril–not the ’bad’ men, not the\npredatory beings.  Those born wrong, the miscarried, the broken–\nthey it is, the WEAKEST who are undermining the vitality of the\nrace, poisoning our trust in life, and putting humanity in\nquestion. Every look of them is a sigh–’Would I were something\nother!  I am sick and tired of what I am.’  In this swamp-soil of\nself-contempt, every poisonous weed flourishes, and all so small,\nso secret, so dishonest, and so sweetly rotten.  Here swarm the\nworms of sensitiveness and resentment, here the air smells odious\nwith secrecy, with what is not to be acknowledged; here is woven\nendlessly the net of the meanest of conspiracies, the conspiracy\nof those who suffer against those who succeed and are victorious;\nhere the very aspect of the victorious is hated–as if health,\nsuccess, strength, pride, and the sense of power were in\nthemselves things vicious, for which one ought eventually to make\nbitter expiation.  Oh, how these people would themselves like to\ninflict the expiation, how they thirst to be the hangmen!  And\nall the while their duplicity never confesses their hatred to\nbe hatred.\"[222]",

        "Poor Nietzsche’s antipathy is itself sickly enough, but we all\nknow what he means, and he expresses well the clash between the\ntwo Ideals.  The carnivorous-minded “strong man,” the adult male\nand cannibal, can see nothing but mouldiness and morbidness in\nthe saint’s gentleness and self-severity, and regards him with\npure loathing.  The whole feud revolves essentially upon two\npivots:  Shall the seen world or the unseen world be our chief\nsphere of adaptation?  and must our means of adaptation in this\nseen world be aggressiveness or non-resistance?",
        "The debate is serious.  In some sense and to some degree both\nworlds must be acknowledged and taken account of; and in the seen\nworld both aggressiveness and non-resistance are needful.  It is\na question of emphasis, of more or less.  Is the saint’s type or\nthe strong-man’s type the more ideal?",
        "It has often been supposed, and even now, I think, it is supposed\nby most persons, that there can be one intrinsically ideal type\nof human character.  A certain kind of man, it is imagined, must\nbe the best man absolutely and apart from the utility of his\nfunction, apart from economical considerations.  The saint’s\ntype, and the knight’s or gentleman’s type, have always been\nrival claimants of this absolute ideality; and in the ideal of\nmilitary religious orders both types were in a manner blended. \nAccording to the empirical philosophy, however, all ideals are\nmatters of relation.  It would be absurd, for example, to ask for\na definition of “the ideal horse,” so long as dragging drays and\nrunning races, bearing children, and jogging about with\ntradesmen’s packages all remain as indispensable differentiations\nof equine function.  You may take what you call a general\nall-round animal as a compromise, but he will be inferior to any\nhorse of a more specialized type, in some one particular\ndirection. We must not forget this now when, in discussing\nsaintliness, we ask if it be an ideal type of manhood.  We must\ntest it by its economical relations.",
        "I think that the method which Mr. Spencer uses in his Data of\nEthics will help to fix our opinion.  Ideality in conduct is\naltogether a matter of adaptation.  A society where all were\ninvariably aggressive would destroy itself by inner friction, and\nin a society where some are aggressive, others must be\nnon-resistant, if there is to be any kind of order. This is the\npresent constitution of society, and to the mixture we owe many\nof our blessings.  But the aggressive members of society are\nalways tending to become bullies, robbers, and swindlers; and no\none believes that such a state of things as we now live in is the\nmillennium.  It is meanwhile quite possible to conceive an\nimaginary society in which there should be no aggressiveness, but\nonly sympathy and fairness–any small community of true friends\nnow realizes such a society.  Abstractly considered, such a\nsociety on a large scale would be the millennium, for every good\nthing might be realized there with no expense of friction.  To\nsuch a millennial society the saint would be entirely adapted. \nHis peaceful modes of appeal would be efficacious over his\ncompanions, and there would be no one extant to take advantage of\nhis non-resistance.  The saint is therefore abstractly a higher\ntype of man than the “strong man,” because he is adapted to the\nhighest society conceivable, whether that society ever be\nconcretely possible or not.  The strong man would immediately\ntend by his presence to make that society deteriorate.  It would\nbecome inferior in everything save in a certain kind of bellicose\nexcitement, dear to men as they now are.",
        "But if we turn from the abstract question to the actual\nsituation, we find that the individual saint may be well or ill\nadapted, according to particular circumstances.  There is, in\nshort, no absoluteness in the excellence of sainthood.  It must\nbe confessed that as far as this world goes, anyone who makes an\nout-and-out saint of himself does so at his peril.  If he is not\na large enough man, he may appear more insignificant and\ncontemptible, for all his saintship, than if he had remained a\nworldling.[223]  Accordingly religion has seldom been so\nradically taken in our Western world that the devotee could not\nmix it with some worldly temper. It has always found good men who\ncould follow most of its impulses, but who stopped short when it\ncame to non-resistance.  Christ himself was fierce upon occasion. \nCromwells, Stonewall Jacksons, Gordons, show that Christians can\nbe strong men also.",
        "[223] We all know DAFT saints, and they inspire a queer kind of\naversion. But in comparing saints with strong men we must choose\nindividuals on the same intellectual level.  The under-witted\nstrong man homologous in his sphere with the under-witted saint,\nis the bully of the slums, the hooligan or rowdy.  Surely on this\nlevel also the saint preserves a certain superiority.",
        "How is success to be absolutely measured when there are so many\nenvironments and so many ways of looking at the adaptation?  It\ncannot be measured absolutely; the verdict will vary according to\nthe point of view adopted.  From the biological point of view\nSaint Paul was a failure, because he was beheaded.  Yet he was\nmagnificently adapted to the larger environment of history; and\nso far as any saint’s example is a leaven of righteousness in the\nworld, and draws it in the direction of more prevalent habits of\nsaintliness, he is a success, no matter what his immediate bad\nfortune may be.  The greatest saints, the spiritual heroes whom\nevery one acknowledges, the Francises, Bernards, Luthers,\nLoyolas, Wesleys, Channings, Moodys, Gratrys, the Phillips\nBrookses, the Agnes Joneses, Margaret Hallahans, and Dora\nPattisons, are successes from the outset.  They show themselves,\nand there is no question; every one perceives their strength and\nstature.  Their sense of mystery in things, their passion, their\ngoodness, irradiate about them and enlarge their outlines while\nthey soften them.  They are like pictures with an atmosphere and\nbackground; and, placed alongside of them, the strong men of this\nworld and no other seem as dry as sticks, as hard and crude as\nblocks of stone or brick-bats.",
        "In a general way, then, and “on the whole,\"[224] our abandonment\nof theological criteria, and our testing of religion by practical\ncommon sense and the empirical method, leave it in possession of\nits towering place in history.  Economically, the saintly group\nof qualities is indispensable to the world’s welfare.  The great\nsaints are immediate successes; the smaller ones are at least\nheralds and harbingers, and they may be leavens also, of a better\nmundane order.  Let us be saints, then, if we can, whether or not\nwe succeed visibly and temporally.  But in our Father’s house are\nmany mansions, and each of us must discover for himself the kind\nof religion and the amount of saintship which best comports with\nwhat he believes to be his powers and feels to be his truest\nmission and vocation.  There are no successes to be guaranteed\nand no set orders to be given to individuals, so long as we\nfollow the methods of empirical philosophy.",
        "[224] See above, p. 321.",
        "This is my conclusion so far.  I know that on some of your minds\nit leaves a feeling of wonder that such a method should have been\napplied to such a subject, and this in spite of all those remarks\nabout empiricism which I made at the beginning of Lecture\nXIII.[225] How, you say, can religion, which believes in two\nworlds and an invisible order, be estimated by the adaptation of\nits fruits to this world’s order alone?  It is its truth, not its\nutility, you insist, upon which our verdict ought to depend.  If\nreligion is true, its fruits are good fruits, even though in this\nworld they should prove uniformly ill adapted and full of naught\nbut pathos.  It goes back, then, after all, to the question of\nthe truth of theology. The plot inevitably thickens upon us; we\ncannot escape theoretical considerations.  I propose, then, that\nto some degree we face the responsibility.  Religious persons\nhave often, though not uniformly, professed to see truth in a\nspecial manner.  That manner is known as mysticism.  I will\nconsequently now proceed to treat at some length of mystical\nphenomena, and after that, though more briefly, I will consider\nreligious philosophy.",
        "[225] Above, pp. 321-327",
        "Over and over again in these lectures I have raised points and\nleft them open and unfinished until we should have come to the\nsubject of Mysticism.  Some of you, I fear, may have smiled as\nyou noted my reiterated postponements.  But now the hour has come\nwhen mysticism must be faced in good earnest, and those broken\nthreads wound up together.  One may say truly, I think, that\npersonal religious experience has its root and centre in mystical\nstates of consciousness; so for us, who in these lectures are\ntreating personal experience as the exclusive subject of our\nstudy, such states of consciousness ought to form the vital\nchapter from which the other chapters get their light.  Whether\nmy treatment of mystical states will shed more light or darkness,\nI do not know, for my own constitution shuts me out from their\nenjoyment almost entirely, and I can speak of them only at second\nhand.  But though forced to look upon the subject so externally,\nI will be as objective and receptive as I can; and I think I\nshall at least succeed in convincing you of the reality of the\nstates in question, and of the paramount importance of their\nfunction.",
        "First of all, then, I ask, What does the expression “mystical\nstates of consciousness” mean?  How do we part off mystical\nstates from other states?",
        "The words “mysticism” and “mystical” are often used as terms of\nmere reproach, to throw at any opinion which we regard as vague\nand vast and sentimental, and without a base in either facts or\nlogic.  For some writers a “mystic” is any person who believes in\nthought-transference, or spirit-return.  Employed in this way the\nword has little value:  there are too many less ambiguous\nsynonyms.  So, to keep it useful by restricting it, I will do\nwhat I did in the case of the word “religion,” and simply propose\nto you four marks which, when an experience has them, may justify\nus in calling it mystical for the purpose of the present\nlectures. In this way we shall save verbal disputation, and the\nrecriminations that generally go therewith.",
        "1.  Ineffability.–The handiest of the marks by which I classify\na state of mind as mystical is negative.  The subject of it\nimmediately says that it defies expression, that no adequate\nreport of its contents can be given in words.  It follows from\nthis that its quality must be directly experienced; it cannot be\nimparted or transferred to others.  In this peculiarity mystical\nstates are more like states of feeling than like states of\nintellect.  No one can make clear to another who has never had a\ncertain feeling, in what the quality or worth of it consists. \nOne must have musical ears to know the value of a symphony; one\nmust have been in love one’s self to understand a lover’s state\nof mind.  Lacking the heart or ear, we cannot interpret the\nmusician or the lover justly, and are even likely to consider him\nweak-minded or absurd. The mystic finds that most of us accord to\nhis experiences an equally incompetent treatment.",
        "2.  Noetic quality.–Although so similar to states of feeling,\nmystical states seem to those who experience them to be also\nstates of knowledge.  They are states of insight into depths of\ntruth unplumbed by the discursive intellect.  They are\nilluminations, revelations, full of significance and importance,\nall inarticulate though they remain; and as a rule they carry\nwith them a curious sense of authority for after-time.",
        "These two characters will entitle any state to be called\nmystical, in the sense in which I use the word.  Two other\nqualities are less sharply marked, but are usually found. These\nare:–",
        "3.  Transiency.–Mystical states cannot be sustained for long. \nExcept in rare instances, half an hour, or at most an hour or\ntwo, seems to be the limit beyond which they fade into the light\nof common day.  Often, when faded, their quality can but\nimperfectly be reproduced in memory; but when they recur it is\nrecognized; and from one recurrence to another it is susceptible\nof continuous development in what is felt as inner richness and\nimportance.",
        "4.  Passivity.–Although the oncoming of mystical states may be\nfacilitated by preliminary voluntary operations, as by fixing the\nattention, or going through certain bodily performances, or in\nother ways which manuals of mysticism prescribe; yet when the\ncharacteristic sort of consciousness once has set in, the mystic\nfeels as if his own will were in abeyance, and indeed sometimes\nas if he were grasped and held by a superior power.  This latter\npeculiarity connects mystical states with certain definite\nphenomena of secondary or alternative personality, such as\nprophetic speech, automatic writing, or the mediumistic trance. \nWhen these latter conditions are well pronounced, however, there\nmay be no recollection whatever of the phenomenon, and it may\nhave no significance for the subject’s usual inner life, to\nwhich, as it were, it makes a mere interruption.  Mystical\nstates, strictly so-called, are never merely interruptive.  Some\nmemory of their content always remains, and a profound sense of\ntheir importance.  They modify the inner life of the subject\nbetween the times of their recurrence.  Sharp divisions in this\nregion are, however, difficult to make, and we find all sorts of\ngradations and mixtures.",
        "These four characteristics are sufficient to mark out a group of\nstates of consciousness peculiar enough to deserve a special name\nand to call for careful study.  Let it then be called the\nmystical group.\n \nOur next step should be to gain acquaintance with some typical\nexamples.  Professional mystics at the height of their\ndevelopment have often elaborately organized experiences and a\nphilosophy based thereupon.  But you remember what I said in my\nfirst lecture:  phenomena are best understood when placed within\ntheir series, studied in their germ and in their over-ripe decay,\nand compared with their exaggerated and degenerated kindred.  The\nrange of mystical experience is very wide, much too wide for us\nto cover in the time at our disposal.  Yet the method of serial\nstudy is so essential for interpretation that if we really wish\nto reach conclusions we must use it.  I will begin, therefore,\nwith phenomena which claim no special religious significance, and\nend with those of which the religious pretensions are extreme.",
        "The simplest rudiment of mystical experience would seem to be\nthat deepened sense of the significance of a maxim or formula\nwhich occasionally sweeps over one. “I’ve heard that said all my\nlife,” we exclaim, “but I never realized its full meaning until\nnow.”  “When a fellow-monk,” said Luther, “one day repeated\nthe words of the Creed:  ’I believe in the forgiveness of sins,’\nI saw the Scripture in an entirely new light; and straightway I\nfelt as if I were born anew.  It was as if I had found the door\nof paradise thrown wide open.\"[226] This sense of deeper\nsignificance is not confined to rational propositions.  Single\nwords,[227] and conjunctions of words, effects of light on land\nand sea, odors and musical sounds, all bring it when the mind is\ntuned aright.  Most of us can remember the strangely moving power\nof passages in certain poems read when we were young, irrational\ndoorways as they were through which the mystery of fact, the\nwildness and the pang of life, stole into our hearts and thrilled\nthem.  The words have now perhaps become mere polished surfaces\nfor us; but lyric poetry and music are alive and significant only\nin proportion as they fetch these vague vistas of a life\ncontinuous with our own, beckoning and inviting, yet ever eluding\nour pursuit.  We are alive or dead to the eternal inner message\nof the arts according as we have kept or lost this mystical\nsusceptibility.",

        "[227] “Mesopotamia” is the stock comic instance.–An excellent\nOld German lady, who had done some traveling in her day, used to\ndescribe to me her Sehnsucht that she might yet visit\n\"Philadelphia,” whose wondrous name had always haunted her\nimagination.  Of John Foster it is said that “single words (as\nchalcedony), or the names of ancient heroes, had a mighty\nfascination over him.  ’At any time the word hermit was enough to\ntransport him.’ The words woods and forests would produce the\nmost powerful emotion.”  Foster’s Life, by Ryland, New York,\n1846, p. 3.",
        "A more pronounced step forward on the mystical ladder is found in\nan extremely frequent phenomenon, that sudden feeling, namely,\nwhich sometimes sweeps over us, of having “been here before,” as\nif at some indefinite past time, in just this place, with just\nthese people, we were already saying just these things.  As\nTennyson writes:",
        "     “Moreover, something is or seems\n      That touches me with mystic gleams,\n      Like glimpses of forgotten dreams–\n\n     “Of something felt, like something here;\n      Of something done, I know not where;\n      Such as no language may declare.\"[228]",
        "[228] The Two Voices.  In a letter to Mr. B. P. Blood, Tennyson\nreports of himself as follows:–",
        "“I have never had any revelations through anaesthetics, but a\nkind of waking trance–this for lack of a better word–I have\nfrequently had, quite up from boyhood, when I have been all\nalone.  This has come upon me through repeating my own name to\nmyself silently, till all at once, as it were out of the\nintensity of the consciousness of individuality, individuality\nitself seemed to dissolve and fade away into boundless being, and\nthis not a confused state but the clearest, the surest of the\nsurest, utterly beyond words–where death was an almost laughable\nimpossibility–the loss of personality (if so it were) seeming no\nextinction, but the only true life.  I am ashamed of my feeble\ndescription.  Have I not said the state is utterly beyond words?”",
        "Professor Tyndall, in a letter, recalls Tennyson saying of this\ncondition:  “By God Almighty! there is no delusion in the matter!\nIt is no nebulous ecstasy, but a state of transcendent wonder,\nassociated with absolute clearness of mind.”  Memoirs of Alfred\nTennyson, ii. 473.",
        "Sir James Crichton-Browne has given the technical name of “dreamy\nstates” to these sudden invasions of vaguely reminiscent\nconsciousness.[229] They bring a sense of mystery and of the\nmetaphysical duality of things, and the feeling of an enlargement\nof perception which seems imminent but which never completes\nitself.  In Dr. Crichton-Browne’s opinion they connect themselves\nwith the perplexed and scared disturbances of self-consciousness\nwhich occasionally precede epileptic attacks.  I think that this\nlearned alienist takes a rather absurdly alarmist view of an\nintrinsically insignificant phenomenon.  He follows it along the\ndownward ladder, to insanity; our path pursues the upward ladder\nchiefly.  The divergence shows how important it is to neglect no\npart of a phenomenon’s connections, for we make it appear\nadmirable or dreadful according to the context by which we set it\noff.",

        "Somewhat deeper plunges into mystical consciousness are met with\nin yet other dreamy states.  Such feelings as these which Charles\nKingsley describes are surely far from being uncommon, especially\nin youth:–",
        "“When I walk the fields, I am oppressed now and then with an\ninnate feeling that everything I see has a meaning, if I could\nbut understand it.  And this feeling of being surrounded with\ntruths which I cannot grasp amounts to indescribable awe\nsometimes. . . .

        "A much more extreme state of mystical consciousness is described\nby J. A. Symonds; and probably more persons than we suspect could\ngive parallels to it from their own experience.",
        "“Suddenly,” writes Symonds, “at church, or in company, or when I\nwas reading, and always, I think, when my muscles were at rest, I\nfelt the approach of the mood.  Irresistibly it took possession\nof my mind and will, lasted what seemed an eternity, and\ndisappeared in a series of rapid sensations which resembled the\nawakening from anaesthetic influence.  One reason why I disliked\nthis kind of trance was that I could not describe it to myself. I\ncannot even now find words to render it intelligible.  It\nconsisted in a gradual but swiftly progressive obliteration of\nspace, time, sensation, and the multitudinous factors of\nexperience which seem to qualify what we are pleased to call our\nSelf. In proportion as these conditions of ordinary consciousness\nwere subtracted, the sense of an underlying or essential\nconsciousness acquired intensity.  At last nothing remained but a\npure, absolute, abstract Self.  The universe became without form\nand void of content.  But Self persisted, formidable in its vivid\nkeenness, feeling the most poignant doubt about reality, ready,\nas it seemed, to find existence break as breaks a bubble round\nabout it.  And what then?  The apprehension of a coming\ndissolution, the grim conviction that this state was the last\nstate of the conscious Self, the sense that I had followed the\nlast thread of being to the verge of the abyss, and had arrived\nat demonstration of eternal Maya or illusion, stirred or seemed\nto stir me up again.  The return to ordinary conditions of\nsentient existence began by my first recovering the power of\ntouch, and then by the gradual though rapid influx of familiar\nimpressions and diurnal interests.  At last I felt myself once\nmore a human being; and though the riddle of what is meant by\nlife remained unsolved I was thankful for this return from the\nabyss–this deliverance from so awful an initiation into the\nmysteries of skepticism.",
        "“This trance recurred with diminishing frequency until I reached\nthe age of twenty-eight.  It served to impress upon my growing\nnature the phantasmal unreality of all the circumstances which\ncontribute to a merely phenomenal consciousness. Often have I\nasked myself with anguish, on waking from that formless state of\ndenuded, keenly sentient being, Which is the unreality–the\ntrance of fiery, vacant, apprehensive, skeptical Self from which\nI issue, or these surrounding phenomena and habits which veil\nthat inner Self and build a self of flesh-and- blood\nconventionality?  Again, are men the factors of some dream, the\ndream-like unsubstantiality of which they comprehend at such\neventful moments?  What would happen if the final stage of the\ntrance were reached?\"[231]",

        "In a recital like this there is certainly something suggestive of\npathology.[232]  The next step into mystical states carries us\ninto a realm that public opinion and ethical philosophy have long\nsince branded as pathological, though private practice and\ncertain lyric strains of poetry seem still to bear witness to its\nideality.  I refer to the consciousness produced by intoxicants\nand anaesthetics, especially by alcohol.  The sway of alcohol\nover mankind is unquestionably due to its power to stimulate the\nmystical faculties of human nature, usually crushed to earth by\nthe cold facts and dry criticisms of the sober hour.  Sobriety\ndiminishes, discriminates, and says no; drunkenness expands,\nunites, and says yes.  It is in fact the great exciter of the YES\nfunction in man.  It brings its votary from the chill periphery\nof things to the radiant core.  It makes him for the moment one\nwith truth.  Not through mere perversity do men run after it.  To\nthe poor and the unlettered it stands in the place of symphony\nconcerts and of literature; and it is part of the deeper mystery\nand tragedy of life that whiffs and gleams of something that we\nimmediately recognize as excellent should be vouchsafed to so\nmany of us only in the fleeting earlier phases of what in its\ntotality is so degrading a poisoning.  The drunken consciousness\nis one bit of the mystic consciousness, and our total opinion of\nit must find its place in our opinion of that larger whole.",
        "[232] Crichton-Browne expressly says that Symonds’s “highest\nnerve centres were in some degree enfeebled or damaged by these\ndreamy mental states which afflicted him so grievously.”   \nSymonds was, however, a perfect monster of many-sided cerebral\nefficiency, and his critic gives no objective grounds whatever\nfor his strange opinion, save that Symonds complained\noccasionally, as all susceptible and ambitious men complain, of\nlassitude and uncertainty as to his life’s mission.",
        "Nitrous oxide and ether, especially nitrous oxide, when\nsufficiently diluted with air, stimulate the mystical\nconsciousness in an extraordinary degree.  Depth beyond depth of\ntruth seems revealed to the inhaler.  This truth fades out,\nhowever, or escapes, at the moment of coming to; and if any words\nremain over in which it seemed to clothe itself, they prove to be\nthe veriest nonsense.  Nevertheless, the sense of a profound\nmeaning having been there persists; and I know more than one\nperson who is persuaded that in the nitrous oxide trance we have\na genuine metaphysical revelation.",
        "Some years ago I myself made some observations on this aspect of\nnitrous oxide intoxication, and reported them in print.  One\nconclusion was forced upon my mind at that time, and my\nimpression of its truth has ever since remained unshaken.  It is\nthat our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as\nwe call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all\nabout it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie\npotential forms of consciousness entirely different.  We may go\nthrough life without suspecting their existence; but apply the\nrequisite stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their\ncompleteness, definite types of mentality which probably\nsomewhere have their field of application and adaptation.  No\naccount of the universe in its totality can be final which leaves\nthese other forms of consciousness quite disregarded.  How to\nregard them is the question–for they are so discontinuous with\nordinary consciousness.  Yet they may determine attitudes though\nthey cannot furnish formulas, and open a region though they fail\nto give a map. At any rate, they forbid a premature closing of\nour\naccounts with reality.  Looking back on my own experiences, they\nall converge towards a kind of insight to which I cannot help\nascribing some metaphysical significance.  The keynote of it is\ninvariably a reconciliation.  It is as if the opposites of the\nworld, whose contradictoriness and conflict make all our\ndifficulties and troubles, were melted into unity.  Not only do\nthey, as contrasted species, belong to one and the same genus,\nbut one of the species, the nobler and better one, is itself the\ngenus, and so soaks up and absorbs its opposite into itself. \nThis is a dark saying, I know, when thus expressed in terms of\ncommon logic, but I cannot wholly escape from its authority. I\nfeel as if it must mean something, something like what the\nhegelian philosophy means, if one could only lay hold of it more\nclearly.  Those who have ears to hear, let them hear; to me the\nliving sense of its reality only comes in the artificial mystic\nstate of mind.[233]",
        "[233] What reader of Hegel can doubt that that sense of a\nperfected Being with all its otherness soaked up into itself,\nwhich dominates his whole philosophy, must have come from the\nprominence in his consciousness of mystical moods like this, in\nmost persons kept subliminal?  The notion is thoroughly\ncharacteristic of the mystical level and the Aufgabe of making it\narticulate was surely set to Hegel’s intellect by mystical\nfeeling.",
        "I just now spoke of friends who believe in the anaesthetic\nrevelation.  For them too it is a monistic insight, in which the\nOTHER in its various forms appears absorbed into the One.",
        "“Into this pervading genius,” writes one of them, “we pass,\nforgetting and forgotten, and thenceforth each is all, in God.\nThere is no higher, no deeper, no other, than the life in which\nwe are founded.  ’The One remains, the many change and pass;’ and\neach and every one of us IS the One that remains. . . . This is\nthe ultimatum. . . .  As sure as being–whence is all our\ncare–so sure is content, beyond duplexity, antithesis, or\ntrouble, where I have triumphed in a solitude that God is not\nabove.\"[234]",
        "[234] Benjamin Paul Blood:  The Anaesthetic Revelation and the\nGist of Philosophy, Amsterdam, N. Y., 1874, pp. 35, 36.  Mr.\nBlood has made several attempts to adumbrate the anaesthetic\nrevelation, in pamphlets of rare literary distinction, privately\nprinted and distributed by himself at Amsterdam.  Xenos Clark, a\nphilosopher, who died young at Amherst in the ’80’s, much\nlamented by those who knew him, was also impressed by the\nrevelation.  “In the first place,” he once wrote to me, “Mr.\nBlood and I agree that the revelation is, if anything\nnon-emotional.  It is utterly flat.  It is, as Mr. Blood says,\n’the one sole and sufficient insight why, or not why, but how,\nthe present is pushed on by the past, and sucked forward by the\nvacuity of the future.  Its inevitableness defeats all attempts\nat stopping or accounting for it.  It is all precedence and\npresupposition, and questioning is in regard to it forever too\nlate.  It is an initiation of the past.’ The real secret would be\nthe formula by which the ’now’ keeps exfoliating out of itself,\nyet never escapes.  What is it, indeed, that keeps existence\nexfoliating?  The formal being of anything, the logical\ndefinition of it, is static.  For mere logic every question\ncontains its own answer–we simply fill the hole with the dirt we\ndug out.  Why are twice two four?  Because, in fact, four is\ntwice two.  Thus logic finds in life no propulsion, only a\nmomentum.  It goes because it is a-going. But the revelation\nadds:  it goes because it is and WAS a-going.  You walk, as it\nwere, round yourself in the revelation.  Ordinary philosophy is\nlike a hound hunting his own tail.  The more he hunts the farther\nhe has to go, and his nose never catches up with his heels,\nbecause it is forever ahead of them.  So the present is already a\nforegone conclusion, and I am ever too late to understand it. \nBut at the moment of recovery from anaesthesis, just then, BEFORE\nSTARTING ON LIFE, I catch, so to speak, a glimpse of my heels, a\nglimpse of the eternal process just in the act of starting.  The\ntruth is that we travel on a journey that was accomplished before\nwe set out; and the real end of philosophy is accomplished, not\nwhen we arrive at, but when we remain in, our destination (being\nalready there)–which may occur vicariously in this life when we\ncease our intellectual questioning. That is why there is a smile\nupon the face of the revelation, as we view it.  It tells us that\nwe are forever half a second too late– that’s all.  ’You could\nkiss your own lips, and have all the fun to yourself,’ it says,\nif you only knew the trick.  It would be perfectly easy if they\nwould just stay there till you got round to them. Why don’t you\nmanage it somehow?”",
        "Dialectically minded readers of this farrago will at least\nrecognize the region of thought of which Mr. Clark writes, as\nfamiliar.  In his latest pamphlet, “Tennyson’s Trances and the\nAnaesthetic Revelation,” Mr. Blood describes its value for life\nas follows:–",
        "“The Anaesthetic Revelation is the Initiation of Man into the\nImmemorial Mystery of the Open Secret of Being, revealed as the\nInevitable Vortex of Continuity.  Inevitable is the word.  Its\nmotive is inherent–it is what has to be.  It is not for any love\nor hate, nor for joy nor sorrow, nor good nor ill.  End,\nbeginning, or purpose, it knows not of.",
        "“It affords no particular of the multiplicity and variety of\nthings but it fills appreciation of the historical and the sacred\nwith a secular and intimately personal illumination of the nature\nand motive of existence, which then seems reminiscent–as if it\nshould have appeared, or shall yet appear, to every participant\nthereof.",
        "“Although it is at first startling in its solemnity, it becomes\ndirectly such a matter of course–so old-fashioned, and so akin\nto proverbs that it inspires exultation rather than fear, and a\nsense of safety, as identified with the aboriginal and the\nuniversal.  But no words may express the imposing certainty of\nthe patient that he is realizing the primordial, Adamic surprise\nof Life.",
        "“Repetition of the experience finds it ever the same, and as if\nit could not possibly be otherwise.  The subject resumes his\nnormal consciousness only to partially and fitfully remember its\noccurrence, and to try to formulate its baffling import–with\nonly this consolatory afterthought:  that he has known the oldest\ntruth, and that he has done with human theories as to the origin,\nmeaning, or destiny of the race.  He is beyond instruction in\n’spiritual things.’",
        "“The lesson is one of central safety:  the Kingdom is within. \nAll days are judgment days:  but there can be no climacteric\npurpose of eternity, nor any scheme of the whole.  The astronomer\nabridges the row of bewildering figures by increasing his unit of\nmeasurement: so may we reduce the distracting multiplicity of\nthings to the unity for which each of us stands.",
        "“This has been my moral sustenance since I have known of it.  In\nmy first printed mention of it I declared:  ’The world is no more\nthe alien terror that was taught me.  Spurning the cloud-grimed\nand still sultry battlements whence so lately Jehovan thunders\nboomed, my gray gull lifts her wing against the nightfall, and\ntakes the dim leagues with a fearless eye.’ And now, after\ntwenty-seven years of this experience, the wing is grayer, but\nthe eye is fearless still, while I renew and doubly emphasize\nthat declaration.  I know–as having known–the meaning of\nExistence:  the sane centre of the universe– at once the wonder\nand the assurance of the soul–for which the speech of reason has\nas yet no name but the Anaesthetic Revelation.” –I have\nconsiderably abridged the quotation.",
        "This has the genuine religious mystic ring! I just now quoted J.\nA. Symonds.  He also records a mystical experience with\nchloroform, as follows:–",
        "’After the choking and stifling had passed away, I seemed at\nfirst in a state of utter blankness; then came flashes of intense\nlight, alternating with blackness, and with a keen vision of what\nwas going on in the room around me, but no sensation of touch. I\nthought that I was near death; when, suddenly, my soul became\naware of God, who was manifestly dealing with me, handling me, so\nto speak, in an intense personal present reality.  I felt him\nstreaming in like light upon me. . . .  I cannot describe the\necstasy I felt.  Then, as I gradually awoke from the influence of\nthe anaesthetics, the old sense of my relation to the world began\nto return, the new sense of my relation to God began to fade.  I\nsuddenly leapt to my feet on the chair where I was sitting, and\nshrieked out, ’It is too horrible, it is too horrible, it is too\nhorrible,’ meaning that I could not bear this disillusionment.\nThen I flung myself on the ground, and at last awoke covered with\nblood, calling to the two surgeons (who were frightened), ’Why\ndid you not kill me?  Why would you not let me die?’ Only think\nof it.  To have felt for that long dateless ecstasy of vision the\nvery God, in all purity and tenderness and truth and absolute\nlove, and then to find that I had after all had no revelation,\nbut that I had been tricked by the abnormal excitement of my\nbrain.",
        "“Yet, this question remains, Is it possible that the inner sense\nof reality which succeeded, when my flesh was dead to impressions\nfrom without, to the ordinary sense of physical relations, was\nnot a delusion but an actual experience?

        "“I wondered if I was in a prison being tortured, and why I\nremembered having heard it said that people ’learn through\nsuffering,’ and in view of what I was seeing, the inadequacy of\nthis saying struck me so much that I said, aloud, ’to suffer IS\nto learn.’",

        "“A great Being or Power was traveling through the sky, his foot\nwas on a kind of lightning as a wheel is on a rail, it was his\npathway.  The lightning was made entirely of the spirits of\ninnumerable people close to one another, and I was one of them. \nHe moved in a straight line, and each part of the streak or flash\ncame into its short conscious existence only that he might\ntravel.  I seemed to be directly under the foot of God, and I\nthought he was grinding his own life up out of my pain.  Then I\nsaw that what he had been trying with all his might to do was to\nCHANGE HIS COURSE, to BEND the line of lightning to which he was\ntied, in the direction in which he wanted to go.  I felt my\nflexibility and helplessness, and knew that he would succeed. He\nbended me, turning his corner by means of my hurt, hurting me\nmore than I had ever been hurt in my life, and at the acutest\npoint of this, as he passed, I SAW.  I understood for a moment\nthings that I have now forgotten, things that no one could\nremember while retaining sanity.  The angle was an obtuse angle,\nand I remember thinking as I woke that had he made it a right or\nacute angle, I should have both suffered and ’seen’ still more,\nand should probably have died.",
        "“He went on and I came to.  In that moment the whole of my life\npassed before me, including each little meaningless piece of\ndistress, and I UNDERSTOOD them.  THIS was what it had all meant,\nTHIS was the piece of work it had all been contributing to do.  I\ndid not see God’s purpose, I only saw his intentness and his\nentire relentlessness towards his means.  He thought no more of\nme than a man thinks of hurting a cork when he is opening wine,\nor hurting a cartridge when he is firing.  And yet, on waking, my\nfirst feeling was, and it came with tears, ’Domine non sum\ndigna,’ for I had been lifted into a position for which I was too\nsmall.  I realized that in that half hour under ether I had\nserved God more distinctly and purely than I had ever done in my\nlife before, or than I am capable of desiring to do.  I was the\nmeans of his achieving and revealing something, I know not what\nor to whom, and that, to the exact extent of my capacity for\nsuffering.",
        "“While regaining consciousness, I wondered why, since I had gone\nso deep, I had seen nothing of what the saints call the LOVE of\nGod, nothing but his relentlessness.  And then I heard an answer,\nwhich I could only just catch, saying, ’Knowledge and Love are\nOne, and the MEASURE is suffering’–I give the words as they came\nto me. With that I came finally to (into what seemed a dream\nworld compared with the reality of what I was leaving), and I saw\nthat what would be called the ’cause’ of my experience was a\nslight operation under insufficient ether, in a bed pushed up\nagainst a window, a common city window in a common city street. \nIf I had to formulate a few of the things I then caught a glimpse\nof, they would run somewhat as follows:–",
        "“The eternal necessity of suffering and its eternal\nvicariousness. The veiled and incommunicable nature of the worst\nsufferings;–the passivity of genius, how it is essentially\ninstrumental and defenseless, moved, not moving, it must do what\nit does;–the impossibility of discovery without its\nprice;–finally, the excess of what the suffering ’seer’ or\ngenius pays over what his generation gains.  (He seems like one\nwho sweats his life out to earn enough to save a district from\nfamine, and just as he staggers back, dying and satisfied,\nbringing a lac of rupees to buy grain with, God lifts the lac\naway, dropping ONE rupee, and says, ’That you may give them. \nThat you have earned for them.  The rest is for ME.’) I perceived\nalso in a way never to be forgotten, the excess of what we see\nover what we can demonstrate.",
        "“And so on!–these things may seem to you delusions, or truisms;\nbut for me they are dark truths, and the power to put them into\neven such words as these has been given me by an ether dream.”",
        "With this we make connection with religious mysticism pure and\nsimple.  Symonds’s question takes us back to those examples which\nyou will remember my quoting in the lecture on the Reality of the\nUnseen, of sudden realization of the immediate presence of God. \nThe phenomenon in one shape or another is not uncommon.",

        "“I never lost the consciousness of the presence of God until I\nstood at the foot of the Horseshoe Falls, Niagara.  Then I lost\nhim in the immensity of what I saw.  I also lost myself, feeling\nthat I was an atom too small for the notice of Almighty God.”",
        "I subjoin another similar case from Starbuck’s collection:–",
        "“In that time the consciousness of God’s nearness came to me\nsometimes.  I say God, to describe what is indescribable.  A\npresence, I might say, yet that is too suggestive of personality,\nand the moments of which I speak did not hold the consciousness\nof a personality, but something in myself made me feel myself a\npart of something bigger than I, that was controlling.  I felt\nmyself one with the grass, the trees, birds, insects, everything\nin Nature.  I exulted in the mere fact of existence, of being a\npart of it all–the drizzling rain, the shadows of the clouds,\nthe tree-trunks, and so on.  In the years following, such moments\ncontinued to come, but I wanted them constantly.  I knew so well\nthe satisfaction of losing self in a perception of supreme power\nand love, that I was unhappy because that perception was not\nconstant.” The cases quoted in my third lecture, pp. 65, 66, 69,\nare still better ones of this type.  In her essay, The Loss of\nPersonality, in The Atlantic Monthly (vol. lxxxv. p. 195), Miss\nEthel D. Puffer explains that the vanishing of the sense of self,\nand the feeling of immediate unity with the object, is due to the\ndisappearance, in these rapturous experiences, of the motor\nadjustments which habitually intermediate between the constant\nbackground of consciousness (which is the Self) and the object in\nthe foreground, whatever it may be.  I must refer the reader to\nthe highly instructive article, which seems to me to throw light\nupon the psychological conditions, though it fails to account for\nthe rapture or the revelation-value of the experience in the\nSubject’s eyes.",

        "“One brilliant Sunday morning, my wife and boys went to the\nUnitarian Chapel in Macclesfield.  I felt it impossible to\naccompany them–as though to leave the sunshine on the hills, and\ngo down there to the chapel, would be for the time an act of\nspiritual suicide.  And I felt such need for new inspiration and\nexpansion in my life.  So, very reluctantly and sadly, I left my\nwife and boys to go down into the town, while I went further up\ninto the hills with my stick and my dog.  In the loveliness of\nthe morning, and the beauty of the hills and valleys, I soon lost\nmy sense of sadness and regret.  For nearly an hour I walked\nalong the road to the ’Cat and Fiddle,’ and then returned.  On\nthe way back, suddenly, without warning, I felt that I was in\nHeaven–an inward state of peace and joy and assurance\nindescribably intense, accompanied with a sense of being bathed\nin a warm glow of light, as though the external condition had\nbrought about the internal effect–a feeling of having passed\nbeyond the body, though the scene around me stood out more\nclearly and as if nearer to me than before, by reason of the\nillumination in the midst of which I seemed to be placed.  This\ndeep emotion lasted, though with decreasing strength, until I\nreached home, and for some time after, only gradually passing\naway.”",

Dreams cannot stand this test.  We wake from them to find\nthat they are but dreams.  Wanderings of an overwrought brain do\nnot stand this test.  These highest experiences that I have had\nof God’s presence have been rare and brief–flashes of\nconsciousness which have compelled me to exclaim with\nsurprise–God is HERE!–or conditions of exaltation and insight,\nless intense, and only gradually passing away.  I have severely\nquestioned the worth of these moments.  To no soul have I named\nthem, lest I should be building my life and work on mere\nphantasies of the brain.  But I find that, after every\nquestioning and test, they stand out to-day as the most real\nexperiences of my life, and experiences which have explained and\njustified and unified all past experiences and all past growth. \nIndeed, their reality and their far-reaching significance are\never becoming more clear and evident.  When they came, I was\nliving the fullest, strongest, sanest, deepest life.  I was not\nseeking them.  What I was seeking, with resolute determination,\nwas to live more intensely my own life, as against what I knew\nwould be the adverse judgment of the world.  It was in the most\nreal seasons that the Real Presence came, and I was aware that I\nwas immersed in the infinite ocean of God.\"[242]",

A Canadian psychiatrist, Dr.\nR. M. Bucke, gives to the more distinctly characterized of these\nphenomena the name of cosmic consciousness.  “Cosmic\nconsciousness in its more striking instances is not,” Dr. Bucke\nsays, “simply an expansion or extension of the self-conscious\nmind with which we are all familiar, but the superaddition of a\nfunction as distinct from any possessed by the average man as\nSELF-consciousness is distinct from any function possessed by one\nof the higher animals.”",

Along with the consciousness of the cosmos there\noccurs an intellectual enlightenment which alone would place the\nindividual on a new plane of existence–would make him almost a\nmember of a new species.  To this is added a state of moral\nexaltation, an indescribable feeling of elevation, elation, and\njoyousness, and a quickening of the moral sense, which is fully\nas striking, and more important than is the enhanced intellectual\npower.

        "“I had spent the evening in a great city, with two friends,\nreading and discussing poetry and philosophy.  We parted at\nmidnight.  I had a long drive in a hansom to my lodging.  My\nmind, deeply under the influence of the ideas, images, and\nemotions called up by the reading and talk, was calm and\npeaceful.  I was in a state of quiet, almost passive enjoyment,\nnot actually thinking, but letting ideas, images, and emotions\nflow of themselves, as it were, through my mind.  All at once,\nwithout warning of any kind, I found myself wrapped in a\nflame-colored cloud.  For an instant I thought of fire, an\nimmense conflagration somewhere close by in that great city; the\nnext, I knew that the fire was within myself.  Directly afterward\nthere came upon me a sense of exultation, of immense joyousness\naccompanied or immediately followed by an intellectual\nillumination impossible to describe.  Among other things, I did\nnot merely come to believe, but I saw that the universe is not\ncomposed of dead matter, but is, on the contrary, a living\nPresence; I became conscious in myself of eternal life.  It was\nnot a conviction that I would have eternal life, but a\nconsciousness that I possessed eternal life then; I saw that all\nmen are immortal; that the cosmic order is such that without any\nperadventure all things work together for the good of each and\nall; that the foundation principle of the world, of all the\nworlds, is what we call love, and that the happiness of each and\nall is in the long run <391> absolutely certain.  The vision\nlasted a few seconds and was gone; but the memory of it and the\nsense of the reality of what it taught has remained during the\nquarter of a century which has since elapsed.  I knew that what\nthe vision showed was true.  I had attained to a point of view\nfrom which I saw that it must be true.  That view, that\nconviction, I may say that consciousness, has never, even during\nperiods of the deepest depression, been lost.\"[244]",

        "In India, training in mystical insight has been known from time\nimmemorial under the name of yoga.  Yoga means the experimental\nunion of the individual with the divine.  It is based on\npersevering exercise; and the diet, posture, breathing,\nintellectual concentration, and moral discipline vary slightly in\nthe different systems which teach it.  The yogi, or disciple, who\nhas by these means overcome the obscurations of his lower nature\nsufficiently, enters into the condition termed samadhi, “and\ncomes face to face with facts which no instinct or reason can\never know.”  He learns–",

All the different steps in yoga are intended to bring us\nscientifically to the superconscious state or Samadhi. . . . \nJust as unconscious work is beneath consciousness, so there is\nanother work which is above consciousness, and which, also, is\nnot accompanied with the feeling of egoism . . . . There is no\nfeeling of I, and yet the mind works, desireless, free from\nrestlessness, objectless, bodiless.  Then the Truth shines in its\nfull effulgence, and we know ourselves–for Samadhi lies\npotential in us all–for what we truly are, free, immortal,\nomnipotent, loosed from the finite, and its contrasts of good and\nevil altogether, and identical with the Atman or Universal\nSoul.\"[245]",

In the second stage the\nintellectual functions drop off, and the satisfied sense of unity\nremains.  In the third stage the satisfaction departs, and\nindifference begins, along with memory a self-consciousness.  In\nthe fourth stage the indifference, memory, and self-consciousness\nare perfected.  [Just what “memory” and “self-consciousness” mean\nin this connection is doubtful.  They cannot be the faculties\nfamiliar to us in the lower life.] Higher stages still of\ncontemplation are mentioned–a region where there exists nothing,\nand where the mediator says:  “There exists absolutely nothing,\"\nand stops. Then he reaches another region where he says:  “There\nare neither ideas nor absence of ideas,” and stops again.  Then\nanother region where, “having reached the end of both idea and\nperception, he stops finally.”  This would seem to be, not yet\nNirvana, but as close an approach to it as this life\naffords.[247]",

        "“The Science of the Sufis,” says the Moslem author, “aims at\ndetaching the heart from all that is not God, and at giving to it\nfor sole occupation the meditation of the divine being.  Theory\nbeing more easy for me than practice, I read [certain books]\nuntil I understood all that can be learned by study and hearsay.\nThen I recognized that what pertains most exclusively to their\nmethod is just what no study can grasp, but only transport,\necstasy, and the transformation of the soul.  How great, for\nexample, is the difference between knowing the definitions of\nhealth, of satiety, with their causes and conditions, and being\nreally healthy or filled.  How different to know in what\ndrunkenness consists–as being a state occasioned by a vapor that\nrises from the stomach–and BEING drunk effectively.  Without\ndoubt, the drunken man knows neither the definition of\ndrunkenness nor what makes it interesting for science.  Being\ndrunk, he knows nothing; whilst the physician, although not drunk\nknows well in what drunkenness consists, and what are its\npredisposing conditions.  Similarly there is a difference between\nknowing the nature of abstinence, and BEING abstinent or having\none’s soul detached from the world.–Thus I had learned what\nwords could teach of Sufism, but what was left could be learned\nneither by study nor through the ears, but solely by giving one’s\nself up to ecstasy and leading a pious life.",
        "“Reflecting on my situation, I found myself tied down by a\nmultitude of bonds–temptations on every side.  Considering my\nteaching, I found it was impure before God.  I saw myself\nstruggling with all my might to achieve glory and to spread my\nname.  [Here follows an account of his six months’ hesitation to\nbreak away from the conditions of his life at Bagdad, at the end\nof which he fell ill with a paralysis of the tongue.] Then,\nfeeling my own weakness, and having entirely given up my own\nwill, I repaired to God like a man in distress who has no more\nresources.  He answered, as he answers the wretch who invokes\nhim.  My heart no longer felt any difficulty in renouncing glory,\nwealth, and my children.  So I quitted Bagdad, and reserving from\nmy fortune only what was indispensable for my subsistence, I\ndistributed the rest.  I went to Syria, where I remained about\ntwo years, with no other occupation than living in retreat and\nsolitude, conquering my desires, combating my passions, training\nmyself to purify my soul, to make my character perfect, to\nprepare my heart for meditating on God–all according to the\nmethods of the Sufis, as I had read of them.",
        "“This retreat only increased my desire to live in solitude, and\nto complete the purification of my heart and fit it for\nmeditation.  But the vicissitudes of the times, the affairs of\nthe family, the need of subsistence, changed in some respects my\nprimitive resolve, and interfered with my plans for a purely\nsolitary life.  I had never yet found myself completely in\necstasy, save in a few single hours; nevertheless, I kept the\nhope of attaining this state.  Every time that the accidents led\nme astray, I sought to return; and in this situation I spent ten\nyears.  During this solitary state things were revealed to me\nwhich it is impossible either to describe or to point out.  I\nrecognized for certain that the Sufis are assuredly walking in\nthe path of God.  Both in their acts and in their inaction,\nwhether internal or external, they are illumined by the light\nwhich proceeds from the prophetic source.  The first condition\nfor a Sufi is to purge his heart entirely of all that is not God.\nThe next key of the contemplative life consists in the humble\nprayers which escape from the fervent soul, and in the\nmeditations on God in which the heart is swallowed up entirely.\nBut in reality this is only the beginning of the Sufi life, the\nend of Sufism being total absorption in God.  The intuitions and\nall that precede are, so to speak, only the threshold for those\nwho enter.  From the beginning revelations take place in so\nflagrant a shape that the Sufis see before them, whilst wide\nawake, the angels and the souls of the prophets.  They hear their\nvoices and obtain their favors.  Then the transport rises from\nthe perception of forms and figures to a degree which escapes all\nexpression, and which no man may seek to give an account of\nwithout his words involving sin.\n \n\"Whosoever has had no experience of the transport knows of the\ntrue nature of prophetism nothing but the name.  He may meanwhile\nbe sure of its existence, both by experience and by what he hears\nthe Sufis say.  As there are men endowed only with the sensitive\nfaculty who reject what is offered them in the way of objects of\nthe pure understanding, so there are intellectual men who reject\nand avoid the things perceived by the prophetic faculty.  A blind\nman can understand nothing of colors save what he has learned by\nnarration and hearsay.  Yet God has brought prophetism near to\nmen in giving them all a state analogous to it in its principal\ncharacters.  This state is sleep. If you were to tell a man who\nwas himself without experience of such a phenomenon that there\nare people who at times swoon away so as to resemble dead men,\nand who [in dreams] yet perceive things that are hidden, he would\ndeny it [and give his reasons].  Nevertheless, his arguments\nwould be refuted by actual experience.  Wherefore, just as the\nunderstanding is a stage of human life in which an eye opens to\ndiscern various intellectual objects uncomprehended by sensation;\njust so in the prophetic the sight is illumined by a light which\nuncovers hidden things and objects which the intellect fails to\nreach.  The chief properties of prophetism are perceptible only\nduring the transport, by those who embrace the Sufi life.  The\nprophet is endowed with qualities to which you possess nothing\nanalogous, and which consequently you cannot possibly understand.",
        "How should you know their true nature, since one knows only what\none can comprehend?  But the transport which one attains by the\nmethod of the Sufis is like an immediate perception, as if one\ntouched the objects with one’s hand.\"[249]",

        "This incommunicableness of the transport is the keynote of all\nmysticism.  Mystical truth exists for the individual who has the\ntransport, but for no one else.  In this, as I have said, it\nresembles the knowledge given to us in sensations more than that\ngiven by conceptual thought.  Thought, with its remoteness and\nabstractness, has often enough in the history of philosophy been\ncontrasted unfavorably with sensation.",
        "It is a commonplace of metaphysics that God’s knowledge cannot be\ndiscursive but must be intuitive, that is, must be constructed\nmore after the pattern of what in ourselves is called immediate\nfeeling, than after that of proposition and judgment.  But our\nimmediate feelings have no content but what the five senses\nsupply; and we have seen and shall see again that mystics may\nemphatically deny that the senses play any part in the very\nhighest type of knowledge which their transports yield.",
        "In the Christian church there have always been mystics. Although\nmany of them have been viewed with suspicion, some have gained\nfavor in the eyes of the authorities.  The experiences of these\nhave been treated as precedents, and a codified system of\nmystical theology has been based upon them, in which everything\nlegitimate finds its place.[250] The basis of the system is\n\"orison” or meditation, the methodical elevation of the soul\ntowards God.  Through the practice of orison the higher levels of\nmystical experience may be attained.  It is odd that\nProtestantism, especially evangelical Protestantism, should\nseemingly have abandoned everything methodical in this line. \nApart from what prayer may lead to, Protestant mystical\nexperience appears to have been almost exclusively sporadic.  It\nhas been left to our mind- curers to reintroduce methodical\nmeditation into our religious life.",

        "The first thing to be aimed at in orison is the mind’s detachment\nfrom outer sensations, for these interfere with its concentration\nupon ideal things.  Such manuals as Saint Ignatius’s Spiritual\nExercises recommend the disciple to <398> expel sensation by a\ngraduated series of efforts to imagine holy scenes.  The acme of\nthis kind of discipline would be a semi-hallucinatory\nmono-ideism–an imaginary figure of Christ, for example, coming\nfully to occupy the mind.  Sensorial images of this sort, whether\nliteral or symbolic, play an enormous part in mysticism.[251] \nBut in certain cases imagery may fall away entirely, and in the\nvery highest raptures it tends to do so.  The state of\nconsciousness becomes then insusceptible of any verbal\ndescription.  Mystical teachers are unanimous as to this. Saint\nJohn of the Cross, for instance, one of the best of them,\nthus describes the condition called the “union of love,” which,\nhe says, is reached by “dark contemplation.”  In this the Deity\ncompenetrates the soul, but in such a hidden way that the soul–",
        "“finds no terms, no means, no comparison whereby to render the\nsublimity of the wisdom and the delicacy of the spiritual feeling\nwith which she is filled. . . . We receive this mystical\nknowledge of God clothed in none of the kinds of images, in none\nof the sensible representations, which our mind makes use of in\nother circumstances.  Accordingly in this knowledge, since the\nsenses and the imagination are not employed, we get neither form\nnor impression, nor can we give any account or furnish any\nlikeness, although the mysterious and sweet-tasting wisdom comes\nhome so clearly to the inmost parts of our soul.  Fancy a man\nseeing a certain kind of thing for the first time in his life. He\ncan understand it, use and enjoy it, but he cannot apply a name\nto it, nor communicate any idea of it, even though all the while\nit be a mere thing of sense.  How much greater will be his\npowerlessness when it goes beyond the senses! This is the\npeculiarity of the divine language.  The more infused, intimate,\nspiritual, and supersensible it is, the more does it exceed the\nsenses, both inner and outer, and impose silence upon them. . . .",
        "The soul then feels as if placed in a vast and profound solitude,\nto which no created thing has access, in an immense and boundless\ndesert, desert the more delicious the more solitary it is. There,\nin this abyss of wisdom, the soul grows by what it drinks in from\nthe well-springs of the comprehension of love, . . . and\nrecognizes, however sublime and learned may be the terms we\nemploy, how utterly vile, insignificant, and improper they are,\nwhen we seek to discourse of divine things by their means.\"[252]",

Saint Teresa is the\nexpert of experts in describing such conditions, so I will turn\nimmediately to what she says of one of the highest of them, the\n\"orison of union.”",
        "“In the orison of union,” says Saint Teresa, “the soul is fully\nawake as regards God, but wholly asleep as regards things of this\nworld and in respect of herself.  During the short time the union\nlasts, she is as it were deprived of every feeling, and even if\nshe would, she could not think of any single thing.  Thus she\nneeds to employ no artifice in order to arrest the use of her\nunderstanding:  it remains so stricken with inactivity that she\nneither knows what she loves, nor in what manner she loves, nor\nwhat she wills.  In short, she is utterly dead to the things of\nthe world and lives solely in God. . . .  I do not even know\nwhether in this state she has enough life left to breathe.  It\nseems to me she has not; or at least that if she does breathe,\nshe is unaware of it.  Her intellect would fain understand\nsomething of what is going on within her, but it has so little\nforce now that it can act in no way whatsoever.  So a person who\nfalls into a deep faint appears as if dead. . . .",
        "“Thus does God, when he raises a soul to union with himself,\nsuspend the natural action of all her faculties.  She neither\nsees, hears, nor understands, so long as she is united with God.\nBut this time is always short, and it seems even shorter than it\nis.  God establishes himself in the interior of this soul in such\na way, that when she returns to herself, it is wholly impossible\nfor her to doubt that she has been in God, and God in her.  This\ntruth remains so strongly impressed on her that, even though many\nyears should pass without the condition returning, she can\nneither forget the favor she received, nor doubt of its reality.\nIf you, nevertheless, ask how it is possible that the soul can\nsee and understand that she has been in God, since during the\nunion she has neither sight nor understanding, I reply that she\ndoes not see it then, but that she sees it clearly later, after\nshe has returned to herself, not by any vision, but by a\ncertitude which abides with her and which God alone can give her.",
        "I knew a person who was ignorant of the truth that God’s mode of\nbeing in everything must be either by presence, by power, or by\nessence, but who, after having received the grace of which I am\nspeaking, believed this truth in the most unshakable manner. So\nmuch so that, having consulted a half-learned man who was as\nignorant on this point as she had been before she was\nenlightened, when he replied that God is in us only by ’grace,’\nshe disbelieved his reply, so sure she was of the true answer;\nand when she came to ask wiser doctors, they confirmed her in her\nbelief, which much consoled her. . . .",
        "“But how, you will repeat, CAN one have such certainty in respect\nto what one does not see?  This question, I am powerless to\nanswer.  These are secrets of God’s omnipotence which it does not\nappertain to me to penetrate.  All that I know is that I tell the\ntruth; and I shall never believe that any soul who does not\npossess this certainty has ever been really united to God.\"[254]",

        "“Saint Ignatius confessed one day to Father Laynez that a single\nhour of meditation at Manresa had taught him more truths about\nheavenly things than all the teachings of all the doctors put\ntogether could have taught him. . . .  One day in orison, on the\nsteps of the choir of the Dominican church, he saw in a distinct\nmanner the plan of divine wisdom in the creation of the world. \nOn another occasion, during a procession, his spirit was ravished\nin God, and it was given him to contemplate, in a form and images\nfitted to the weak understanding of a dweller on the earth, the\ndeep mystery of the holy Trinity.

For I saw and knew the being of all things, the Byss\nand the Abyss, and the eternal generation of the holy Trinity,\nthe descent and original of the world and of all creatures\nthrough the divine wisdom.  I knew and saw in myself all the\nthree worlds, the external and visible world being of a\nprocreation or extern birth from both the internal and spiritual\nworlds; and I saw and knew the whole working essence, in the evil\nand in the good, and the mutual original and existence, and\nlikewise how the fruitful bearing womb of eternity brought forth.\nSo that I did not only greatly wonder at it, but did also\nexceedingly rejoice, albeit I could very hardly apprehend the\nsame in my external man and set it down with the pen.

The soul after such a favor is\nanimated with a degree of courage so great that if at that moment\nits body should be torn to pieces for the cause of God, it would\nfeel nothing but the liveliest comfort.

Now she sees in this name nothing more than an\nimmense lie of which the world remains a victim.  She discovers,\nin the new light from above, that in genuine honor there is\nnothing spurious, that to be faithful to this honor is to give\nour respect to what deserves to be respected really, and to\nconsider as nothing, or as less than nothing, whatsoever perishes\nand is not agreeable to God. . . .

        "“Jesus has come to take up his abode in my heart.  It is not so\nmuch a habitation, an association, as a sort of fusion.  Oh, new\nand blessed life! life which becomes each day more luminous. . .\n. The wall before me, dark a few moments since, is splendid at\nthis hour because the sun shines on it.  Wherever its rays fall\nthey light up a conflagration of glory; the smallest speck of\nglass sparkles, each grain of sand emits fire; even so there is a\nroyal song of triumph in my heart <410> because the Lord is\nthere.  My days succeed each other; yesterday a blue sky; to day\na clouded sun; a night filled with strange dreams; but as soon as\nthe eyes open, and I regain consciousness and seem to begin life\nagain, it is always the same figure before me, always the same\npresence filling my heart. . . .  Formerly the day was dulled by\nthe absence of the Lord.  I used to wake invaded by all sorts of\nsad impressions, and I did not find him on my path.  To-day he is\nwith me; and the light cloudiness which covers things is not an\nobstacle to my communion with him.  I feel the pressure of his\nhand, I feel something else which fills me with a serene joy;\nshall I dare to speak it out?  Yes, for it is the true expression\nof what I experience.  The Holy Spirit is not merely making me a\nvisit; it is no mere dazzling apparition which may from one\nmoment to another spread its wings and leave me in my night, it\nis a permanent habitation.  He can depart only if he takes me\nwith him.  More than that; he is not other than myself:  he is\none with me.  It is not a juxtaposition, it is a penetration, a\nprofound modification of my nature, a new manner of my being.”   \nQuoted from the MS. of an old man by Wilfred Monod: II Vit: \nsix meditations sur le mystere chretien, pp. 280-283.",
        "This overcoming of all the usual barriers between the individual\nand the Absolute is the great mystic achievement.  In mystic\nstates we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware\nof our oneness.  This is the everlasting and triumphant mystical\ntradition, hardly altered by differences of clime or creed.  In\nHinduism, in Neoplatonism, in Sufism, in Christian mysticism, in\nWhitmanism, we find the same recurring note, so that there is\nabout mystical utterances an eternal unanimity which ought to\nmake a critic stop and think, and which brings it about that the\nmystical classics have, as has been said, neither birthday nor\nnative land.

        "(1) Mystical states, when well developed, usually are, and have\nthe right to be, absolutely authoritative over the individuals to\nwhom they come.",
        "(2) No authority emanates from them which should make it a duty\nfor those who stand outside of them to accept their revelations\nuncritically.",
        "(3) They break down the authority of the non-mystical or\nrationalistic consciousness, based upon the understanding and the\nsenses alone.  They show it to be only one kind of consciousness.",
        "They open out the possibility of other orders of truth, in which,\nso far as anything in us vitally responds to them, we may freely\ncontinue to have faith.",
        "I will take up these points one by one.",
        "               1.\nAs a matter of psychological fact, mystical states of a\nwell-pronounced and emphatic sort ARE usually authoritative over\nthose who have them.[281] They have been “there,” and know.  It\nis vain for rationalism to grumble about this. If the mystical\ntruth that comes to a man proves to be a force that he can live\nby, what mandate have we of the majority to order him to live in\nanother way?  We can throw him into a prison or a madhouse, but\nwe cannot change his mind–we commonly attach it only the more\nstubbornly to its beliefs.[282] It mocks our utmost efforts, as a\nmatter of fact, and in point of logic it absolutely escapes our\njurisdiction.  Our own more “rational” beliefs are based on\nevidence exactly similar in nature to that which mystics quote\nfor theirs.  Our senses, namely, have assured us of certain\nstates of fact; but mystical experiences are as direct\nperceptions of fact for those who have them as any sensations\never were for us.  The records show that even though the five\nsenses be in abeyance in them, they are absolutely sensational in\ntheir epistemological quality, if I may be pardoned the barbarous\nexpression–that is, they are face to face presentations of what\nseems immediately to exist. [281] I abstract from weaker states,\nand from those cases of which the books are full, where the\ndirector (but usually not the subject) remains in doubt whether\nthe experience may not have proceeded from the demon.",
        "[282] Example:  Mr. John Nelson writes of his imprisonment for\npreaching Methodism:  “My soul was as a watered garden, and I\ncould sing praises to God all day long; for he turned my\ncaptivity into joy, and gave me to rest as well on the boards, as\nif I had been on a bed of down.  Now could I say, ’God’s service\nis perfect freedom,’ and I was carried out much in prayer that my\nenemies might drink of the same river of peace which my God gave\nso largely to me.”  Journal, London, no date, p. 172.",
        "The mystic is, in short, INVULNERABLE, and must be left, whether\nwe relish it or not, in undisturbed enjoyment of his creed. \nFaith, says Tolstoy, is that by which men live. And faith-state\nand mystic state are practically convertible terms.",
        "               2.\nBut I now proceed to add that mystics have no right to claim that\nwe ought to accept the deliverance of their peculiar experiences,\nif we are ourselves outsiders and feel no private call thereto. \nThe utmost they can ever ask of us in this life is to admit that\nthey establish a presumption.  They form a consensus and have an\nunequivocal outcome; and it would be odd, mystics might say, if\nsuch a unanimous type of experience should prove to be altogether\nwrong.  At bottom, however, this would only be an appeal to\nnumbers, like the appeal of rationalism the other way; and the\nappeal to numbers has no logical force.  If we acknowledge it, it\nis for “suggestive,” not for logical reasons:  we follow the\nmajority because to do so suits our life.",
        "But even this presumption from the unanimity of mystics is far\nfrom being strong.  In characterizing mystic states an\npantheistic, optimistic, etc., I am afraid I over-simplified the\ntruth.  I did so for expository reasons, and to keep the closer\nto the classic mystical tradition.  The classic religious\nmysticism, it now must be confessed, is only a “privileged case.”",
        "  \nIt is an EXTRACT, kept true to type by the selection of the\nfittest specimens and their preservation in “schools.” It is\ncarved out from a much larger mass; and if we take the larger\nmass as seriously as religious mysticism has historically taken\nitself, we find that the supposed unanimity largely disappears. \nTo begin with, even religious mysticism itself, the kind that\naccumulates traditions and makes schools, is much less unanimous\nthan I have allowed.  It has been both ascetic and antinomianly\nself-indulgent within the Christian church.[283] It is dualistic\nin Sankhya, and monistic in Vedanta philosophy.  I called it\npantheistic; but the great Spanish mystics are anything but\npantheists.  They are with few exceptions non-metaphysical minds,\nfor whom “the category of personality” is absolute.  The “union\"\nof man with God is for them much more like an occasional miracle\nthan like an original identity.[284]  How different again, apart\nfrom the happiness common to all, is the mysticism of Walt\nWhitman, Edward Carpenter, Richard Jefferies, and other\nnaturalistic pantheists, from the more distinctively Christian\nsort.[285]  The fact is that the mystical feeling of enlargement,\nunion, and emancipation has no specific intellectual content\nwhatever of its own.  It is capable of forming matrimonial\nalliances with material furnished by the most diverse\nphilosophies and theologies, provided only they can find a place\nin their framework for its peculiar emotional mood.  We have no\nright, therefore, to invoke its prestige as distinctively in\nfavor of any special belief, such as that in absolute idealism,\nor in the absolute monistic identity, or in the absolute\ngoodness, of the world.  It is only relatively in favor of all\nthese things–it passes out of common human consciousness in the\ndirection in which they lie.",

        "So much for religious mysticism proper.  But more remains to be\ntold, for religious mysticism is only one half of mysticism.  The\nother half has no accumulated traditions except those which the\ntext-books on insanity supply.  Open any one of these, and you\nwill find abundant cases in which “mystical ideas” are cited as\ncharacteristic symptoms of enfeebled or deluded states of mind. \nIn delusional insanity, paranoia, as they sometimes call it, we\nmay have a DIABOLICAL mysticism, a sort of religious mysticism\nturned upside down. The same sense of ineffable importance in the\nsmallest events, the same texts and words coming with new\nmeanings, the same voices and visions and leadings and missions,\nthe same controlling by extraneous powers; only this time the\nemotion is pessimistic:  instead of consolations we have\ndesolations; the meanings are dreadful; and the powers are\nenemies to life.  It is evident that from the point of view of\ntheir psychological mechanism, the classic mysticism and these\nlower mysticisms spring from the same mental level, from that\ngreat subliminal or transmarginal region of which science is\nbeginning to admit the existence, but of which so little is\nreally known.  That region contains every kind of matter: \n\"seraph and snake” abide there side by side.  To come from thence\nis no infallible credential.  What comes must be sifted and\ntested, and run the gauntlet of confrontation with the total\ncontext of experience, just like what comes from the outer world\nof sense.  Its value must be ascertained by empirical methods, so\nlong as we are not mystics ourselves.",
        "Once more, then, I repeat that non-mystics are under no\nobligation to acknowledge in mystical states a superior authority\nconferred on them by their intrinsic nature.[286]",
        "[286] In chapter i. of book ii. of his work Degeneration, “Max\nNordau” seeks to undermine all mysticism by exposing the weakness\nof the lower kinds.  Mysticism for him means any sudden\nperception of hidden significance in things.  He explains such\nperception by the abundant uncompleted associations which\nexperiences may arouse in a degenerate brain.  These give to him\nwho has the experience a vague and vast sense of its leading\nfurther, yet they awaken no definite or useful consequent in his\nthought.  The explanation is a plausible one for certain sorts of\nfeeling of significance, and other alienists (Wernicke, for\nexample, in his Grundriss der Psychiatrie, Theil ii., Leipzig,\n1896) have explained “paranoiac” conditions by a laming of the\nassociation-organ.  But the higher mystical flights, with their\npositiveness and abruptness, are surely products of no such\nmerely negative condition.  It seems far more reasonable to\nascribe them to inroads from the subconscious life, of the\ncerebral activity correlative to which we as yet know nothing.",
        "               3.\nYet, I repeat once more, the existence of mystical states\nabsolutely overthrows the pretension of non-mystical states to be\nthe sole and ultimate dictators of what we may believe. As a\nrule, mystical states merely add a supersensuous meaning to the\nordinary outward data of consciousness.  They are excitements\nlike the emotions of love or ambition, gifts to our spirit by\nmeans of which facts already objectively before us fall into a\nnew expressiveness and make a new connection with our active\nlife.  They do not contradict these facts as such, or deny\nanything that our senses have immediately seized.[287] It is the\nrationalistic critic rather who plays the part of denier in the\ncontroversy, and his denials have no strength, for there never\ncan be a state of facts to which new meaning may not truthfully\nbe added, provided the mind ascend to a more enveloping point of\nview.  It must always remain an open question whether mystical\nstates may not possibly be such superior points of view, windows\nthrough which the mind looks out upon a more extensive and\ninclusive world.  The difference of the views seen from the\ndifferent mystical windows need not prevent us from entertaining\nthis supposition.  The wider world would in that case prove to\nhave a mixed constitution like that of this world, that is all. \nIt would have its celestial and its infernal regions, its\ntempting and its saving moments, its valid experiences and its\ncounterfeit ones, just as our world has them; but it would be a\nwider world all the same.  We should have to use its experiences\nby selecting and subordinating and substituting just as is our\ncustom in this ordinary naturalistic world; we should be liable\nto error just as we are now; yet the counting in of that wider\nworld of meanings, and the serious dealing with it, might, in\nspite of all the perplexity, be indispensable stages in our\napproach to the final fullness of the truth. ",
        "[287] They sometimes add subjective audita et visa to the facts,\nbut as these are usually interpreted as transmundane, they oblige\nno alteration in the facts of sense.",
        "In this shape, I think, we have to leave the subject.  Mystical\nstates indeed wield no authority due simply to their being\nmystical states.  But the higher ones among them point in\ndirections to which the religious sentiments even of non-\nmystical men incline.  They tell of the supremacy of the ideal,\nof vastness, of union, of safety, and of rest.  They offer us\nHYPOTHESES, hypotheses which we may voluntarily ignore, but which\nas thinkers we cannot possibly upset.  The supernaturalism and\noptimism to which they would persuade us may, interpreted in one\nway or another, be after all the truest of insights into the\nmeaning of this life.",
        "“Oh, the little more, and how much it is; and the little less,\nand what worlds away!”  It may be that possibility and permission\nof this sort are all that are religious consciousness requires to\nlive on.  In my last lecture I shall have to try to persuade you\nthat this is the case.  Meanwhile, however, I am sure that for\nmany of my readers this diet is too slender. If supernaturalism\nand inner union with the divine are true, you think, then not so\nmuch permission, as compulsion to believe, ought to be found. \nPhilosophy has always professed to prove religious truth by\ncoercive argument; and the construction of philosophies of this\nkind has always been one favorite function of the religious life,\nif we use this term in the large historic sense.  But religious\nphilosophy is an enormous subject, and in my next lecture I can\nonly give that brief glance at it which my limits will allow.",
        "The subject of Saintliness left us face to face with the\nquestion, Is the sense of divine presence a sense of anything\nobjectively true?  We turned first to mysticism for an answer,\nand found that although mysticism is entirely willing to\ncorroborate religion, it is too private (and also too various) in\nits utterances to be able to claim a universal authority.  But\nphilosophy publishes results which claim to be universally valid\nif they are valid at all, so we now turn with our question to\nphilosophy.  Can philosophy stamp a warrant of veracity upon the\nreligious man’s sense of the divine?",
        "I imagine that many of you at this point begin to indulge in\nguesses at the goal to which I am tending.  I have undermined the\nauthority of mysticism, you say, and the next thing I shall\nprobably do is to seek to discredit that of philosophy. \nReligion, you expect to hear me conclude, is nothing but an\naffair of faith, based either on vague sentiment, or on that\nvivid sense of the reality of things unseen of which in my second\nlecture and in the lecture on Mysticism I gave so many examples. \nIt is essentially private and individualistic; it always exceeds\nour powers of formulation; and although attempts to pour its\ncontents into a philosophic mould will probably always go on, men\nbeing what they are, yet these attempts are always secondary\nprocesses which in no way add to the authority, or warrant the\nveracity, of the sentiments from which they derive their own\nstimulus and borrow whatever glow of conviction they may\nthemselves possess.  ",
        "In short, you suspect that I am planning to defend feeling at the\nexpense of reason, to rehabilitate the primitive and\nunreflective, and to dissuade you from the hope of any Theology\nworthy of the name.",
        "To a certain extent I have to admit that you guess rightly. I do\nbelieve that feeling is the deeper source of religion, and that\nphilosophic and theological formulas are secondary products, like\ntranslations of a text into another tongue.  But all such\nstatements are misleading from their brevity, and it will take\nthe whole hour for me to explain to you exactly what I mean.",
        "When I call theological formulas secondary products, I mean that\nin a world in which no religious feeling had ever existed, I\ndoubt whether any philosophic theology could ever have been\nframed.  I doubt if dispassionate intellectual contemplation of\nthe universe, apart from inner unhappiness and need of\ndeliverance on the one hand and mystical emotion on the other,\nwould ever have resulted in religious philosophies such as we now\npossess.  Men would have begun with animistic explanations of\nnatural fact, and criticised these away into scientific ones, as\nthey actually have done. In the science they would have left a\ncertain amount of “psychical research,” even as they now will\nprobably have to re-admit a certain amount.  But high-flying\nspeculations like those of either dogmatic or idealistic\ntheology, these they would have had no motive to venture on,\nfeeling no need of commerce with such deities.  These\nspeculations must, it seems to me, be classed as over-beliefs,\nbuildings-out performed by the intellect into directions of which\nfeeling originally supplied the hint.",
        "But even if religious philosophy had to have its first hint\nsupplied by feeling, may it not have dealt in a superior way with\nthe matter which feeling suggested?  Feeling is private and dumb,\nand unable to give an account of itself.  It allows that its\nresults are mysteries and enigmas, declines to justify them\nrationally, and on occasion is willing that they should even\npass for paradoxical and absurd.  Philosophy takes just the\nopposite attitude.  Her aspiration is to reclaim from mystery and\nparadox whatever territory she touches.  To find an escape from\nobscure and wayward personal persuasion to truth objectively\nvalid for all thinking men has ever been the intellect’s most\ncherished ideal.  To redeem religion from unwholesome privacy,\nand to give public status and universal right of way to its\ndeliverances, has been reason’s task.",
        "I believe that philosophy will always have opportunity to labor\nat this task.[288] We are thinking beings, and we cannot exclude\nthe intellect from participating in any of our functions.  Even\nin soliloquizing with ourselves, we construe our feelings\nintellectually.  Both our personal ideals and our religious and\nmystical experiences must be interpreted congruously with the\nkind of scenery which our thinking mind inhabits.  The\nphilosophic climate of our time inevitably forces its own\nclothing on us.  Moreover, we must exchange our feelings with one\nanother, and in doing so we have to speak, and to use general and\nabstract verbal formulas. Conceptions and constructions are thus\na necessary part of our religion; and as moderator amid the clash\nof hypotheses, and mediator among the criticisms of one man’s\nconstructions by another, philosophy will always have much to do.",
        "It would be strange if I disputed this, when these very lectures\nwhich I am giving are (as you will see more clearly from now\nonwards) a laborious attempt to extract from the privacies of\nreligious experience some general facts which can be defined in\nformulas upon which everybody may agree.",
        "[288] Compare Professor W. Wallace’s Gifford Lectures, in\nLectures and Essays, Oxford, 1898, pp. 17 ff.",
        "Religious experience, in other words, spontaneously and\ninevitably engenders myths, superstitions, dogmas, creeds, and\nmetaphysical theologies, and criticisms of one set of these by\nthe adherents of another.  Of late, impartial classifications and\ncomparisons have become possible, alongside of the denunciations\nand anathemas by which the commerce between creeds used\nexclusively to be carried on.  We have the beginnings of a\n\"Science of Religions,” so-called; and if these lectures could\never be accounted a crumb-like contribution to such a science, I\nshould be made very happy.",
        "But all these intellectual operations, whether they be\nconstructive or comparative and critical, presuppose immediate\nexperiences as their subject-matter.  They are interpretative and\ninductive operations, operations after the fact, consequent upon\nreligious feeling, not coordinate with it, not independent of\nwhat it ascertains.",
        "The intellectualism in religion which I wish to discredit\npretends to be something altogether different from this.  It\nassumes to construct religious objects out of the resources of\nlogical reason alone, or of logical reason drawing rigorous\ninference from non-subjective facts.  It calls its conclusions\ndogmatic theology, or philosophy of the absolute, as the case may\nbe; it does not call them science of religions.  It reaches them\nin an a priori way, and warrants their veracity.",
        "Warranted systems have ever been the idols of aspiring souls. \nAll-inclusive, yet simple; noble, clean, luminous, stable,\nrigorous, true;–what more ideal refuge could there be than such\na system would offer to spirits vexed by the muddiness and\naccidentality of the world of sensible things? Accordingly, we\nfind inculcated in the theological schools of to-day, almost as\nmuch as in those of the fore-time, a disdain for merely possible\nor probable truth, and of results that only private assurance can\ngrasp. Scholastics and idealists both express this disdain. \nPrincipal John Caird, for example, writes as follows in his\nIntroduction to the Philosophy of Religion:–",
        "“Religion must indeed be a thing of the heart, but in order to\nelevate it from the region of subjective caprice and waywardness,\nand to distinguish between that which is true and false in\nreligion, we must appeal to an objective standard.  That which\nenters the heart must first be discerned by the intelligence to\nbe TRUE.  It must be seen as having in its own nature a RIGHT to\ndominate feeling, and as constituting the principle by which\nfeeling must be judged.[289] In estimating the religious\ncharacter of individuals, nations, or races, the first question\nis, not how they feel, but what they think and believe–not\nwhether their religion is one which manifests itself in emotions,\nmore or less vehement and enthusiastic, but what are the\nCONCEPTIONS of God and divine things by which these emotions are\ncalled forth.  Feeling is necessary in religion, but it is by the\nCONTENT or intelligent basis of a religion, and not by feeling,\nthat its character and worth are to be determined.\"[290]",

        "[290] Ibid., p. 186, abridged and italicized.",
        "Cardinal Newman, in his work, The Idea of a University, gives\nmore emphatic expression still to this disdain for\nsentiment.[291] Theology, he says, is a science in the strictest\nsense of the word.  I will tell you, he says, what it is not–\nnot “physical evidences” for God, not “natural religion,” for\nthese are but vague subjective interpretations:–",
        "[291] Discourse II.  Section 7.",
        "“If,” he continues, “the Supreme Being is powerful or skillful,\njust so far as the telescope shows power, or the microscope shows\nskill, if his moral law is to be ascertained simply by the\nphysical processes of the animal frame, or his will gathered from\nthe immediate issues of human affairs, if his Essence is just as\nhigh and deep and broad as the universe and no more if this be\nthe fact, then will I confess that there is no specific science\nabout God, that theology is but a name, and a protest in its\nbehalf an hypocrisy.  Then, pious as it is to think of Him while\nthe pageant of experiment or abstract reasoning passes by, still\nsuch piety is nothing more than a poetry of thought, or an\nornament of language, a certain view taken of Nature which one\nman has and another has not, which gifted minds strike out, which\nothers see to be admirable and ingenious, and which all would be\nthe better for adopting.  It is but the theology of Nature, just\nas we talk of the PHILOSOPHY or the ROMANCE of history, or the\nPOETRY of childhood, or the picturesque or the sentimental or the\nhumorous, or any other abstract quality which the genius or the\ncaprice of the individual, or the fashion of the day, or the\nconsent of the world, recognizes in any set of objects which are\nsubjected to its contemplation.  I do not see much difference\nbetween avowing that there is no God, and implying that nothing\ndefinite can be known for certain about Him.”",
        "What I mean by Theology, continues Newman, is none of these\nthings:  “I simply mean the SCIENCE OF GOD, or the truths we know\nabout God, put into a system, just as we have a science of the\nstars and call it astronomy, or of the crust of the earth and\ncall it geology.”",
        "In both these extracts we have the issue clearly set before us: \nFeeling valid only for the individual is pitted against reason\nvalid universally.  The test is a perfectly plain one of fact. \nTheology based on pure reason must in point of fact convince men\nuniversally.  If it did not, wherein would its superiority\nconsist?  If it only formed sects and schools, even as sentiment\nand mysticism form them, how would it fulfill its programme of\nfreeing us from personal caprice and waywardness?  This perfectly\ndefinite practical test of the pretensions of philosophy to found\nreligion on universal reason simplifies my procedure to-day.  I\nneed not discredit philosophy by laborious criticism of its\narguments. It will suffice if I show that as a matter of history\nit fails to prove its pretension to be “objectively” convincing. \nIn fact, philosophy does so fail.  It does not banish\ndifferences; it founds schools and sects just as feeling does.  I\nbelieve, in fact, that the logical reason of man operates in this\nfield of divinity exactly as it has always operated in love, or\nin patriotism, or in politics, or in any other of the wider\naffairs of life, in which our passions or our mystical intuitions\nfix our beliefs beforehand.  It finds arguments for our\nconviction, for indeed it HAS to find them.  It amplifies and\ndefines our faith, and dignifies it and lends it words and\nplausibility.  It hardly ever engenders it; it cannot now secure\nit.[292]",
        "[292] As regards the secondary character of intellectual\nconstructions, and the primacy of feeling and instinct in\nfounding religious beliefs see the striking work of H. Fielding,\nThe Hearts of Men, London, 1902, which came into my hands after\nmy text was written.  “Creeds,” says the author, “are the grammar\nof religion, they are to religion what grammar is to speech. \nWords are the expression of our wants grammar is the theory\nformed afterwards.  Speech never proceeded from grammar, but the\nreverse.  As speech progresses and changes from unknown causes,\ngrammar must follow” (p. 313).  The whole book, which keeps\nunusually close to concrete facts, is little more than an\namplification of this text.",
        "Lend me your attention while I run through some of the points of\nthe older systematic theology.  You find them in both Protestant\nand Catholic manuals, best of all in the innumerable text-books\npublished since Pope Leo’s Encyclical recommending the study of\nSaint Thomas.  I glance first at the arguments by which dogmatic\ntheology establishes God’s existence, after that at those by\nwhich it establishes his nature.[293]",
        "[293] For convenience’ sake, I follow the order of A. Stockl’s\nLehrbuch der Philosophie, 5te Autlage, Mainz, 1881, Band ii.  B. \nBoedder’s Natural Theology, London, 1891, is a handy English\nCatholic Manual; but an almost identical doctrine is given by\nsuch Protestant theologians as C. Hodge:  Systematic Theology,\nNew York, 1873, or A. H. Strong:  Systematic Theology, 5th\nedition, New York, 1896.",
        "The arguments for God’s existence have stood for hundreds of\nyears with the waves of unbelieving criticism breaking against\nthem, never totally discrediting them in the ears of the\nfaithful, but on the whole slowly and surely washing out the\nmortar from between their joints.  If you have a God already whom\nyou believe in, these arguments confirm you. If you are\natheistic, they fail to set you right.  The proofs are various. \nThe “cosmological” one, so-called, reasons from the contingence\nof the world to a First Cause which must contain whatever\nperfections the world itself contains.  The “argument\nfrom design” reasons, from the fact that Nature’s laws are\nmathematical, and her parts benevolently adapted to each other,\nthat this cause is both intellectual and benevolent. The “moral\nargument” is that the moral law presupposes a lawgiver.  The\n\"argument ex consensu gentium” is that the belief in God is so\nwidespread as to be grounded in the rational nature of man, and\nshould therefore carry authority with it.",
        "As I just said, I will not discuss these arguments technically.\nThe bare fact that all idealists since Kant have felt entitled\neither to scout or to neglect them shows that they are not solid\nenough to serve as religion’s all-sufficient foundation. \nAbsolutely impersonal reasons would be in duty bound to show more\ngeneral convincingness.  Causation is indeed too obscure a\nprinciple to bear the weight of the whole structure of theology. \nAs for the argument from design, see how Darwinian ideas have\nrevolutionized it.  Conceived as we now conceive them, as so many\nfortunate escapes from almost limitless processes of destruction,\nthe benevolent adaptations which we find in Nature suggest a\ndeity very different from the one who figured in the earlier\nversions of the argument.[294] The fact is that these arguments \ndo but follow the combined suggestions of the facts and of our\nfeeling.  They prove nothing rigorously.  They only corroborate\nour preexistent partialities.",
        "[294] It must not be forgotten that any form of DISorder in the\nworld might, by the design argument, suggest a God for just that\nkind of disorder.  The truth is that any state of things whatever\nthat can be named is logically susceptible of teleological\ninterpretation. The ruins of the earthquake at Lisbon, for\nexample:  the whole of past history had to be planned exactly as\nit was to bring about in the fullness of time just that\nparticular arrangement of debris of masonry, furniture, and once\nliving bodies.  No other train of causes would have been\nsufficient.  And so of any other arrangement, bad or good, which\nmight as a matter of fact be found resulting anywhere from\nprevious conditions.  To avoid such pessimistic consequences and\nsave its beneficent designer, the design argument accordingly\ninvokes two other principles, restrictive in their operation. \nThe first is physical:  Nature’s forces tend of their own accord\nonly to disorder and destruction, to heaps of ruins, not to\narchitecture.",
        "This principle, though plausible at first sight, seems, in the\nlight of recent biology, to be more and more improbable.  The\nsecond principle is one of anthropomorphic interpretation.  No\narrangement that for us is “disorderly” can possibly have been an\nobject of design at all.  This principle is of course a mere\nassumption in the interests of anthropomorphic Theism.",
        "When one views the world with no definite theological bias one\nway or the other, one sees that order and disorder, as we now\nrecognize them, are purely human inventions.  We are interested\nin certain types of arrangement, useful, aesthetic, or moral–so\ninterested that whenever we find them realized, the fact\nemphatically rivets our attention.  The result is that we work\nover the contents of the world selectively.  It is overflowing\nwith disorderly arrangements from our point of view, but order is\nthe only thing we care for and look at, and by choosing, one can\nalways find some sort of orderly arrangement in the midst of any\nchaos.  If I should throw down a thousand beans at random upon a\ntable, I could doubtless, by eliminating a sufficient number of\nthem, leave the rest in almost any geometrical pattern you might\npropose to me, and you might then say that that pattern was the\nthing prefigured beforehand, and that the other beans were mere\nirrelevance and packing material.  Our dealings with Nature are\njust like this.  She is a vast plenum in which our attention\ndraws capricious lines in innumerable directions.  We count and\nname whatever lies upon the special lines we trace, whilst the\nother things and the untraced lines are neither named nor\ncounted. There are in reality infinitely more things “unadapted\"\nto each other in this world than there are things “adapted\";\ninfinitely more things with irregular relations than with regular\nrelations between them.  But we look for the regular kind of\nthing exclusively, and ingeniously discover and preserve it in\nour memory.  It accumulates with other regular kinds, until the\ncollection of them fills our encyclopaedias.  Yet all the while\nbetween and around them lies an infinite anonymous chaos of\nobjects that no one ever thought of together, of relations that\nnever yet attracted our attention.",
        "The facts of order from which the physico-theological argument\nstarts are thus easily susceptible of interpretation as arbitrary\nhuman products.  So long as this is the case, although of course\nno argument against God follows, it follows that the argument for\nhim will fail to constitute a knockdown proof of his existence. \nIt will be convincing only to those who on other grounds believe\nin him already.",
        "If philosophy can do so little to establish God’s existence, how\nstands it with her efforts to define his attributes?  It is worth\nwhile to look at the attempts of systematic theology in this\ndirection.",
        "Since God is First Cause, this science of sciences says, he\ndiffers from all his creatures in possessing existence a se. \nFrom this “a-se-ity” on God’s part, theology deduces by mere\nlogic most of his other perfections.  For instance, he must be\nboth NECESSARY and ABSOLUTE, cannot not be, and cannot in any way\nbe determined by anything else.  This makes Him absolutely\nunlimited from without, and unlimited also from within; for\nlimitation is non-being; and God is being itself.  This\nunlimitedness makes God infinitely perfect.  Moreover, God is\nONE, and ONLY, for the infinitely perfect can admit no peer.  He\nis SPIRITUAL, for were He composed of physical parts, some other\npower would have to combine them into the total, and his aseity\nwould thus be contradicted.  He is therefore both simple and\nnon-physical in nature.  He is SIMPLE METAPHYSICALLY also, that\nis to say, his nature and his existence cannot be distinct, as\nthey are in finite substances which share their formal natures\nwith one another, and are individual only in their material\naspect.  Since God is one and only, his essentia and his esse\nmust be given at one stroke.  This excludes from his being all\nthose distinctions, so familiar in the world of finite things,\nbetween potentiality and actuality, substance and accidents,\nbeing and activity, existence and attributes.  We can talk, it is\ntrue, of God’s powers, acts, and attributes, but these\ndiscriminations are only “virtual,” and made from the human point\nof view.  In God all these points of view fall into an absolute\nidentity of being.",
        "This absence of all potentiality in God obliges Him to be\nIMMUTABLE.  He is actuality, through and through.  Were there\nanything potential about Him, He would either lose or gain by its\nactualization, and either loss or gain would contradict his\nperfection.  He cannot, therefore, change.  Furthermore, He is\nIMMENSE, BOUNDLESS; for could He be outlined in space, He would\nbe composite, and this would contradict his indivisibility. He is\ntherefore OMNIPRESENT, indivisibly there, at every point of\nspace.  He is similarly wholly present at every point of time–in\nother words ETERNAL.  For if He began in time, He would need a\nprior cause, and that would contradict his aseity.  If He ended\nit would contradict his necessity.  If He went through any\nsuccession, it would contradict his immutability.",
        "He has INTELLIGENCE and WILL and every other creature-\nperfection, for we have them, and effectus nequit superare\ncausam.  In Him, however, they are absolutely and eternally in\nact, and their OBJECT, since God can be bounded by naught that is\nexternal, can primarily be nothing else than God himself.  He\nknows himself, then, in one eternal indivisible act, and wills\nhimself with an infinite self-pleasure.[295] Since He must of\nlogical necessity thus love and will himself, He cannot be called\n\"free” ad intra, with the freedom of contrarieties that\ncharacterizes finite creatures.  Ad extra, however, or with\nrespect to his creation, God is free.  He cannot NEED to create,\nbeing perfect in being and in happiness already.  He WILLS to\ncreate, then, by an absolute freedom.",
        "[295] For the scholastics the facultas appetendi embraces\nfeeling, desire, and will.",
        "Being thus a substance endowed with intellect and will and\nfreedom, God is a PERSON; and a LIVING person also, for He is\nboth object and subject of his own activity, and to be this\ndistinguishes the living from the lifeless.  He is thus\nabsolutely SELF-SUFFICIENT:  his SELF-KNOWLEDGE and SELF-LOVE are\nboth of them infinite and adequate, and need no extraneous\nconditions to perfect them.",
        "He is OMNISCIENT, for in knowing himself as Cause He knows all\ncreature things and events by implication.  His knowledge is\nprevisive, for He is present to all time.  Even our free acts are\nknown beforehand to Him, for otherwise his wisdom would admit of\nsuccessive moments of enrichment, and this would contradict his\nimmutability.  He is OMNIPOTENT for everything that does not\ninvolve logical contradiction.  He can make BEING –in other\nwords his power includes CREATION.  If what He creates were made\nof his own substance, it would have to be infinite in essence, as\nthat substance is; but it is finite; so it must be non-divine in\nsubstance.  If it were made of a substance, an eternally existing\nmatter, for example, which God found there to his hand, and to\nwhich He simply gave its form, that would contradict God’s\ndefinition as First Cause, and make Him a mere mover of something\ncaused already.  The things he creates, then, He creates ex\nnihilo, and gives them absolute being as so many finite\nsubstances additional to himself.  The forms which he imprints\nupon them have their prototypes in his ideas.  But as in God\nthere is no such thing as multiplicity, and as these ideas for us\nare manifold, we must distinguish the ideas as they are in God\nand the way in which our minds externally imitate them.  We must\nattribute them to Him only in a TERMINATIVE sense, as differing\naspects, from the finite point of view, of his unique essence.",
        "God of course is holy, good, and just.  He can do no evil, for He\nis positive being’s fullness, and evil is negation.  It is true\nthat He has created physical evil in places, but only as a means\nof wider good, for bonum totius praeeminet bonum partis. Moral\nevil He cannot will, either as end or means, for that would\ncontradict his holiness.  By creating free beings He PERMITS it\nonly, neither his justice nor his goodness obliging Him to\nprevent the recipients of freedom from misusing the gift.",
        "As regards God’s purpose in creating, primarily it can only have\nbeen to exercise his absolute freedom by the manifestation to\nothers of his glory.  From this it follows that the others must\nbe rational beings, capable in the first place of knowledge,\nlove, and honor, and in the second place of happiness, for the\nknowledge and love of God is the mainspring of felicity.  In so\nfar forth one may say that God’s secondary purpose in creating is\nLOVE.",
        "I will not weary you by pursuing these metaphysical\ndeterminations farther, into the mysteries of God’s Trinity, for\nexample.  What I have given will serve as a specimen of the\northodox philosophical theology of both Catholics and\nProtestants.  Newman, filled with enthusiasm at God’s list of\nperfections, continues the passage which I began to quote to you\nby a couple of pages of a rhetoric so magnificent that I can\nhardly refrain from adding them, in spite of the inroad they\nwould make upon our time.[296]  He first enumerates God’s\nattributes sonorously, then celebrates his ownership of\neverything in earth and Heaven, and the dependence of all that\nhappens upon his permissive will.  He gives us scholastic\nphilosophy “touched with emotion,” and every philosophy should be\ntouched with emotion to be rightly understood.  Emotionally,\nthen, dogmatic theology is worth something to minds of the type\nof Newman’s.  It will aid us to estimate what it is worth\nintellectually, if at this point I make a short digression.",
        "[296] Op. cit., Discourse III. Section 7.",
        "What God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. The\nContinental schools of philosophy have too often overlooked the\nfact that man’s thinking is organically connected with his\nconduct.  It seems to me to be the chief glory of English and\nScottish thinkers to have kept the organic connection in view. \nThe guiding principle of British philosophy has in fact been that\nevery difference must MAKE a difference, every theoretical\ndifference somewhere issue in a practical difference, and that\nthe best method of discussing points of theory is to begin by\nascertaining what practical difference would result from one\nalternative or the other being true.  What is the particular\ntruth in question KNOWN AS?  In what facts does it result?  What\nis its cash-value in terms of particular experience?  This is the\ncharacteristic English way of taking up a question.  In this way,\nyou remember, Locke takes up the question of personal identity.\nWhat you mean by it is just your chain of particular memories,\nsays he.  That is the only concretely verifiable part of its\nsignificance.  All further ideas about it, such as the oneness or\nmanyness of the spiritual substance on which it is based, are\ntherefore void of intelligible meaning; and propositions touching\nsuch ideas may be indifferently affirmed or denied.  So Berkeley\nwith his “matter.”",
        "The cash-value of matter is our physical sensations.  That is\nwhat it is known as, all that we concretely verify of its\nconception.  That, therefore, is the whole meaning of the term\n\"matter\"–any other pretended meaning is mere wind of words. \nHume does the same thing with causation.  It is known as habitual\nantecedence, and as tendency on our part to look for something\ndefinite to come.  Apart from this practical meaning it has no\nsignificance whatever, and books about it may be committed to the\nflames, says Hume.  Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown, James Mill,\nJohn Mill, and Professor Bain, have followed more or less\nconsistently the same method; and Shadworth Hodgson has used the\nprinciple with full explicitness.  When all is said and done, it\nwas English and Scotch writers, and not Kant, who introduced “the\ncritical method” into philosophy, the one method fitted to make\nphilosophy a study worthy of serious men.  For what seriousness\ncan possibly remain in debating philosophic propositions that\nwill never make an appreciable difference to us in action?  And\nwhat could it matter, if all propositions were practically\nindifferent, which of them we should agree to call true or which\nfalse?",
        "An American philosopher of eminent originality, Mr. Charles\nSanders Peirce, has rendered thought a service by disentangling\nfrom the particulars of its application the principle by which\nthese men were instinctively guided, and by singling it out as\nfundamental and giving to it a Greek name.  He calls it the\nprinciple of PRAGMATISM, and he defends it somewhat as\nfollows:[297]–",
        "[297] In an article, How to make our Ideas Clear, in the Popular\nScience Monthly for January, 1878, vol. xii. p. 286.",
        "Thought in movement has for its only conceivable motive the\nattainment of belief, or thought at rest.  Only when our thought\nabout a subject has found its rest in belief can our action on\nthe subject firmly and safely begin.  Beliefs, in short, are\nrules for action; and the whole function of thinking is but one\nstep in the production of active habits.  If there were any part\nof a thought that made no difference in the thought’s practical\nconsequences, then that part would be no proper element of the\nthought’s significance.  To develop a thought’s meaning we need\ntherefore only determine what conduct it is fitted to produce;\nthat conduct is for us its sole significance; and the tangible\nfact at the root of all our thought-distinctions is that there is\nno one of them so fine as to consist in anything but a possible\ndifference of practice.  To attain perfect clearness in our\nthoughts of an object, we need then only consider what\nsensations, immediate or remote, we are conceivably to expect\nfrom it, and what conduct we must prepare in case the object\nshould be true.  Our conception of these practical consequences\nis for us the whole of our conception of the object, so far as\nthat conception has positive significance at all.",
        "This is the principle of Peirce, the principle of pragmatism.\nSuch a principle will help us on this occasion to decide, among\nthe various attributes set down in the scholastic inventory of\nGod’s perfections, whether some be not far less significant than\nothers.",
        "If, namely, we apply the principle of pragmatism to God’s\nmetaphysical attributes, strictly so called, as distinguished\nfrom his moral attributes, I think that, even were we forced by a\ncoercive logic to believe them, we still should have to confess\nthem to be destitute of all intelligible significance. Take God’s\naseity, for example; or his necessariness; his immateriality; his\n\"simplicity” or superiority to the kind of inner variety and\nsuccession which we find in finite beings, his indivisibility,\nand lack of the inner distinctions of being and activity,\nsubstance and accident, potentiality and actuality, and the rest;\nhis repudiation of inclusion in a genus; his actualized infinity;\nhis “personality,” apart from the moral qualities which it may\ncomport; his relations to evil being permissive and not positive;\nhis self-sufficiency, self-love, and absolute felicity in\nhimself:–candidly speaking, how do such qualities as these\nmake any definite connection with our life?  And if they\nseverally call for no distinctive adaptations of our conduct,\nwhat vital difference can it possibly make to a man’s religion\nwhether they be true or false?",
        "For my own part, although I dislike to say aught that may grate\nupon tender associations, I must frankly confess that even though\nthese attributes were faultlessly deduced, I cannot conceive of\nits being of the smallest consequence to us religiously that any\none of them should be true.  Pray, what specific act can I\nperform in order to adapt myself the better to God’s simplicity? \nOr how does it assist me to plan my behavior, to know that his\nhappiness is anyhow absolutely complete?  In the middle of the\ncentury just past, Mayne Reid was the great writer of books of\nout-of-door adventure. He was forever extolling the hunters and\nfield-observers of living animals’ habits, and keeping up a fire\nof invective against the “closet-naturalists,” as he called them,\nthe collectors and classifiers, and handlers of skeletons and\nskins.  When I was a boy, I used to think that a closet-\nnaturalist must be the vilest type of wretch under the sun. But\nsurely the systematic theologians are the closet-naturalists of\nthe deity, even in Captain Mayne Reid’s sense.  What is their\ndeduction of metaphysical attributes but a shuffling and matching\nof pedantic dictionary-adjectives, aloof from morals, aloof from\nhuman needs, something that might be worked out from the mere\nword “God” by one of those logical machines of wood and brass\nwhich recent ingenuity has contrived as well as by a man of flesh\nand blood.  They have the trail of the serpent over them.  One\nfeels that in the theologians’ hands, they are only a set of\ntitles obtained by a mechanical manipulation of synonyms;\nverbality has stepped into the place of vision, professionalism\ninto that of life.  Instead of bread we have a stone; instead of\na fish, a serpent.  Did such a conglomeration of abstract terms\ngive really the gist of our knowledge of the deity, schools of\ntheology might indeed continue to flourish, but religion, vital\nreligion, would have taken its flight from this world. What keeps\nreligion going is something else than abstract definitions and\nsystems of concatenated adjectives, and something different from\nfaculties of theology and their professors.  All these things are\nafter-effects, secondary accretions upon those phenomena of vital\nconversation with the unseen divine, of which I have shown you so\nmany instances, renewing themselves in saecula saeculorum in the\nlives of humble private men.",
        "So much for the metaphysical attributes of God!  From the point\nof view of practical religion, the metaphysical monster which\nthey offer to our worship is an absolutely worthless invention of\nthe scholarly mind.",
        "What shall we now say of the attributes called moral?\nPragmatically, they stand on an entirely different footing. They\npositively determine fear and hope and expectation, and are\nfoundations for the saintly life.  It needs but a glance at them\nto show how great is their significance.",
        "God’s holiness, for example:  being holy, God can will nothing\nbut the good.  Being omnipotent, he can secure its triumph. \nBeing omniscient, he can see us in the dark.  Being just, he can\npunish us for what he sees.  Being loving, he can pardon too. \nBeing unalterable, we can count on him securely.  These qualities\nenter into connection with our life, it is highly important that\nwe should be informed concerning them.  That God’s purpose in\ncreation should be the manifestation of his glory is also an\nattribute which has definite relations to our practical life. \nAmong other things it has given a definite character to worship\nin all Christian countries.  If dogmatic theology really does\nprove beyond dispute that a God with characters like these\nexists, she may well claim to give a solid basis to religious\nsentiment.  But verily, how stands it with her arguments?",
        "It stands with them as ill as with the arguments for his\nexistence.  Not only do post-Kantian idealists reject them root\nand branch, but it is a plain historic fact that they never have\nconverted any one who has found in the moral complexion of the\nworld, as he experienced it, reasons for doubting that a good God\ncan have framed it.  To prove God’s goodness by the scholastic\nargument that there is no non-being in his essence would sound\nto such a witness simply silly.",
        "No! the book of Job went over this whole matter once for all and\ndefinitively.  Ratiocination is a relatively superficial and\nunreal path to the deity:  “I will lay mine hand upon my mouth; I\nhave heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye\nseeth Thee.”  An intellect perplexed and baffled, yet a\ntrustful sense of presence–such is the situation of the man who\nis sincere with himself and with the facts, but who remains\nreligious still.[298]",

But who, in the present state of theological\nopinion on that point, will dare maintain that hell fire or its\nequivalent in some shape is rendered certain by pure logic? \nTheology herself has largely based this doctrine upon revelation,\nand, in discussing it, has tended more and more to substitute\nconventional ideas of criminal law for a priori principles of\nreason.  But the very notion that this glorious universe, with\nplanets and winds, and laughing sky and ocean, should have been\nconceived and had its beams and rafters laid in technicalities of\ncriminality, is incredible to our modern imagination.  It weakens\na religion to hear it argued upon such a basis.",
        "We must therefore, I think, bid a definitive good-by to dogmatic\ntheology.  In all sincerity our faith must do without that\nwarrant.  Modern idealism, I repeat, has said goodby to this\ntheology forever.  Can modern idealism give faith a better\nwarrant, or must she still rely on her poor self for witness?",
        "The basis of modern idealism is Kant’s doctrine of the\nTranscendental Ego of Apperception.  By this formidable term Kant\nmerely meant the fact that the consciousness “I think them” must\n(potentially or actually) accompany all our objects.  Former\nskeptics had said as much, but the “I” in question had remained\nfor them identified with the personal individual.  Kant\nabstracted and depersonalized it, and made it the most universal\nof all his categories, although for Kant himself the\nTranscendental Ego had no theological implications.",
        "It was reserved for his successors to convert Kant’s notion of\nBewusstsein uberhaupt, or abstract consciousness, into an\ninfinite concrete self-consciousness which is the soul of the\nworld, and in which our sundry personal self-consciousnesses\nhave their being.  It would lead me into technicalities to show\nyou even briefly how this transformation was in point of fact\neffected.  Suffice it to say that in the Hegelian school, which\nto-day so deeply influences both British and American thinking,\ntwo principles have borne the brunt of the operation.",
        "The first of these principles is that the old logic of identity\nnever gives us more than a post-mortem dissection of disjecta\nmembra, and that the fullness of life can be construed to thought\nonly by recognizing that every object which our thought may\npropose to itself involves the notion of some other object which\nseems at first to negate the first one.",
        "The second principle is that to be conscious of a negation is\nalready virtually to be beyond it.  The mere asking of a question\nor expression of a dissatisfaction proves that the answer or the\nsatisfaction is already imminent; the finite, realized as such,\nis already the infinite in posse.",
        "Applying these principles, we seem to get a propulsive force into\nour logic which the ordinary logic of a bare, stark self-identity\nin each thing never attains to.  The objects of our thought now\nACT within our thought, act as objects act when given in\nexperience.  They change and develop. They introduce something\nother than themselves along with them; and this other, at first\nonly ideal or potential, presently proves itself also to be\nactual.  It supersedes the thing at first supposed, and both\nverifies and corrects it, in developing the fullness of its\nmeaning.",
        "The program is excellent; the universe IS a place where things\nare followed by other things that both correct and fulfill them;\nand a logic which gave us something like this movement of fact\nwould express truth far better than the traditional school-logic,\nwhich never gets of its own accord from anything to anything\nelse, and registers only predictions and subsumptions, or static\nresemblances and differences. Nothing could be more unlike the\nmethods of dogmatic theology than those of this new logic.  Let\nme quote in illustration some passages from the Scottish\ntranscendentalist whom I have already named.",
        "“How are we to conceive,” Principal Caird writes, “of the reality\nin which all intelligence rests?”  He replies:  “Two things may\nwithout difficulty be proved, viz., that this reality is an\nabsolute Spirit, and conversely that it is only in communion with\nthis absolute Spirit or Intelligence that the finite Spirit can\nrealize itself.  It is absolute; for the faintest movement of\nhuman intelligence would be arrested, if it did not presuppose\nthe absolute reality of intelligence, of thought itself.  Doubt\nor denial themselves presuppose and indirectly affirm it.  When I\npronounce anything to be true, I pronounce it, indeed, to be\nrelative to thought, but not to be relative to my thought, or to\nthe thought of any other individual mind.  From the existence of\nall individual minds as such I can abstract; I can think them\naway.  But that which I cannot think away is thought or\nself-consciousness itself, in its independence and absoluteness,\nor, in other words, an Absolute Thought or Self-Consciousness.”",
        "Here, you see, Principal Caird makes the transition which Kant\ndid not make:  he converts the omnipresence of consciousness in\ngeneral as a condition of “truth” being anywhere possible, into\nan omnipresent universal consciousness, which he identifies with\nGod in his concreteness.  He next proceeds to use the principle\nthat to acknowledge your limits is in essence to be beyond them;\nand makes the transition to the religious experience of\nindividuals in the following words:–",
        "“If [Man] were only a creature of transient sensations and\nimpulses, of an ever coming and going succession of intuitions,\nfancies, feelings, then nothing could ever have for him the\ncharacter of objective truth or reality.  But it is the\nprerogative of man’s spiritual nature that he can yield himself\nup to a thought and will that are infinitely larger than his own. \nAs a thinking self-conscious being, indeed, he may be said, by\nhis very nature, to live in the atmosphere of the Universal Life.",
        "As a thinking being, it is possible for me to suppress and quell\nin my consciousness every movement of self-assertion, every\nnotion and opinion that is merely mine, every desire that belongs\nto me as this particular Self, and to become the pure medium of a\nthought that is universal–in one word, to live no more my own\nlife, but let my consciousness be possessed and suffused by the\nInfinite and Eternal life of spirit.  And yet it is just in this\nrenunciation of self that I truly gain myself, or realize the\nhighest possibilities of my own nature.  For whilst in one sense\nwe give up self to live the universal and absolute life of\nreason, yet that to which we thus surrender ourselves is in\nreality our truer self.  The life of absolute reason is not a\nlife that is foreign to us.”",
        "Nevertheless, Principal Caird goes on to say, so far as we are\nable outwardly to realize this doctrine, the balm it offers\nremains incomplete.  Whatever we may be in posse, the very best\nof us in actu falls very short of being absolutely divine. Social\nmorality, love, and self-sacrifice even, merge our Self only in\nsome other finite self or selves.  They do not quite identify it\nwith the Infinite.  Man’s ideal destiny, infinite in abstract\nlogic, might thus seem in practice forever unrealizable.",
        "“Is there, then,” our author continues, “no solution of the\ncontradiction between the ideal and the actual?  We answer, There\nis such a solution, but in order to reach it we are carried\nbeyond the sphere of morality into that of religion.  It may be\nsaid to be the essential characteristic of religion as contrasted\nwith morality, that it changes aspiration into fruition,\nanticipation into realization; that instead of leaving man in the\ninterminable pursuit of a vanishing ideal, it makes him the\nactual partaker of a divine or infinite life.  Whether we view\nreligion from the human side or the divine–as the surrender of\nthe soul to God, or as the life of God in the soul–in either\naspect it is of its very essence that the Infinite has ceased to\nbe a far-off vision, and has become a present reality.  The very\nfirst pulsation of the spiritual life, when we rightly apprehend\nits significance, is the indication that the division between the\nSpirit and its object has vanished, that the ideal has become\nreal, that the finite has reached its goal and become suffused\nwith the presence and life of the Infinite.",
        "“Oneness of mind and will with the divine mind and will is not\nthe future hope and aim of religion, but its very beginning and\nbirth in the soul.  To enter on the religious life is to\nterminate the struggle.  In that act which constitutes the\nbeginning of the religious life–call it faith, or trust, or\nself-surrender, or by whatever name you will–there is involved\nthe identification of the finite with a life which is eternally\nrealized.  It is true indeed that the religious life is\nprogressive; but understood in the light of the foregoing idea,\nreligious progress is not progress TOWARDS, but WITHIN the sphere\nof the Infinite.  It is not the vain attempt by endless finite\nadditions or increments to become possessed of infinite wealth,\nbut it is the endeavor, by the constant exercise of spiritual\nactivity, to appropriate that infinite inheritance of which we\nare already in possession.  The whole future of the religious\nlife is given in its beginning, but it is given implicitly.  The\nposition of the man who has entered on the religious life is that\nevil, error, imperfection, do not really belong to him:  they are\nexcrescences which have no organic relation to his true nature: \nthey are already virtually, as they will be actually, suppressed\nand annulled, and in the very process of being annulled they\nbecome the means of spiritual progress.  Though he is not exempt\nfrom temptation and conflict, [yet] in that inner sphere in which\nhis true life lies, the struggle is over, the victory already\nachieved.  It is not a finite but an infinite life which the\nspirit lives.  Every pulse-beat of its [existence] is the\nexpression and realization of the life of God.\"[299]",

        "You will readily admit that no description of the phenomena of\nthe religious consciousness could be better than these words of\nyour lamented preacher and philosopher. They reproduce the very\nrapture of those crises of conversion of which we have been\nhearing; they utter what the mystic felt but was unable to\ncommunicate; and the saint, in hearing them, recognizes his own\nexperience.  It is indeed gratifying to find the content of\nreligion reported so unanimously.  But when all is said and done,\nhas Principal Caird–and I only use him as an example of that\nwhole mode of thinking–transcended the sphere of feeling and of\nthe direct experience of the individual, and laid the foundations\nof religion in impartial reason?  Has he made religion universal\nby coercive reasoning, transformed it from a private faith into a\npublic certainty?  Has he rescued its affirmations from obscurity\nand mystery?",
        "I believe that he has done nothing of the kind, but that he has\nsimply reaffirmed the individual’s experiences in a more\ngeneralized vocabulary.  And again, I can be excused from proving\ntechnically that the transcendentalist reasonings fail to make\nreligion universal, for I can point to the plain fact that a\nmajority of scholars, even religiously disposed ones, stubbornly\nrefuse to treat them as convincing.  The whole of Germany, one\nmay say, has positively rejected the Hegelian argumentation.  As\nfor Scotland, I need only mention Professor Fraser’s and\nProfessor Pringle-Pattison’s memorable criticisms, with which so\nmany of you are familiar.[300]  Once more, I ask, if\ntranscendental idealism were <445> as objectively and absolutely\nrational as it pretends to be, could it possibly fail so\negregiously to be persuasive?",

        "The most persuasive arguments in favor of a concrete individual\nSoul of the world, with which I am acquainted, are those of my\ncolleague, Josiah Royce, in his Religious Aspect of Philosophy,\nBoston, 1885; in his Conception of God, New York and London,\n1897; and lately in his Aberdeen Gifford Lectures, The World and\nthe Individual, 2 vols., New York and London, 1901-02.  I\ndoubtless seem to some of my readers to evade the philosophic\nduty which my thesis in this lecture imposes on me, by not even\nattempting to meet Professor Royce’s arguments articulately.  I\nadmit the momentary evasion.  In the present lectures, which are\ncast throughout in a popular mould, there seemed no room for\nsubtle metaphysical discussion, and for tactical purposes it was\nsufficient the contention of philosophy being what it is (namely,\nthat religion can be transformed into a universally convincing\nscience), to point to the fact that no religious philosophy has\nactually convinced the mass of thinkers.  Meanwhile let me say\nthat I hope that the present volume may be followed by another,\nif I am spared to write it, in which not only Professor Royce’s\narguments, but others for monistic absolutism shall be considered\nwith all the technical fullness which their great importance\ncalls for.  At present I resign myself to lying passive under the\nreproach of superficiality.",
        "What religion reports, you must remember, always purports to be a\nfact of experience:  the divine is actually present, religion\nsays, and between it and ourselves relations of give and take are\nactual.  If definite perceptions of fact like this cannot stand\nupon their own feet, surely abstract reasoning cannot give them\nthe support they are in need of.  Conceptual processes can class\nfacts, define them, interpret them; but they do not produce them,\nnor can they reproduce their individuality.  There is always a\nPLUS, a THISNESS, which feeling alone can answer for.  Philosophy\nin this sphere is thus a secondary function, unable to warrant\nfaith’s veracity, and so I revert to the thesis which I announced\nat the beginning of this lecture.",
        "In all sad sincerity I think we must conclude that the attempt to\ndemonstrate by purely intellectual processes the truth of the\ndeliverances of direct religious experience is absolutely\nhopeless.",
        "It would be unfair to philosophy, however, to leave her under\nthis negative sentence.  Let me close, then, by briefly\nenumerating what she CAN do for religion.  If she will abandon\nmetaphysics and deduction for criticism and induction, and\nfrankly transform herself from theology into science of\nreligions, she can make herself enormously useful.",
        "The spontaneous intellect of man always defines the divine which\nit feels in ways that harmonize with its temporary intellectual\nprepossessions.  Philosophy can by comparison eliminate the local\nand the accidental from these definitions.  Both from dogma and\nfrom worship she can remove historic incrustations.  By\nconfronting the spontaneous religious constructions with the\nresults of natural science, philosophy can also eliminate\ndoctrines that are now known to be scientifically absurd or\nincongruous.\n \nSifting out in this way unworthy formulations, she can leave a\nresiduum of conceptions that at least are possible. With these\nshe can deal as HYPOTHESES, testing them in all the manners,\nwhether negative or positive, by which hypotheses are ever\ntested.  She can reduce their number, as some are found more open\nto objection.  She can perhaps become the champion of one which\nshe picks out as being the most closely verified or verifiable. \nShe can refine upon the definition of this hypothesis,\ndistinguishing between what is innocent over-belief and symbolism\nin the expression of it, and what is to be literally taken.  As a\nresult, she can offer mediation between different believers, and\nhelp to bring about consensus of opinion.  She can do this the\nmore successfully, the better she discriminates the common and\nessential from the individual and local elements of the religious\nbeliefs which she compares.",
        "I do not see why a critical Science of Religions of this sort\nmight not eventually command as general a public adhesion as is\ncommanded by a physical science.  Even the personally\nnon-religious might accept its conclusions on trust, much as\nblind persons now accept the facts of optics–it might appear as\nfoolish to refuse them.  Yet as the science of optics has to be\nfed in the first instance, and continually verified later, by\nfacts experienced by seeing persons; so the science of religions\nwould depend for its original material on facts of personal\nexperience, and would have to square itself with personal\nexperience through all its critical reconstructions.  It could\nnever get away from concrete life, or work in a conceptual\nvacuum.  It would forever have to confess, as every science\nconfesses, that the subtlety of nature flies beyond it, and that\nits formulas are but approximations. Philosophy lives in words,\nbut truth and fact well up into our lives in ways that exceed\nverbal formulation.  There is in the living act of perception\nalways something that glimmers and twinkles and will not be\ncaught, and for which reflection comes too late.  No one knows\nthis as well as the philosopher.  He must fire his volley of new\nvocables out of his conceptual shotgun, for his profession\ncondemns him to this industry, but he secretly knows the\nhollowness and irrelevancy. His formulas are like stereoscopic or\nkinetoscopic photographs seen outside the instrument; they lack\nthe depth, the motion, the vitality.  In the religious sphere, in\nparticular, belief that formulas are true can never wholly take\nthe place of personal experience.",
        "In my next lecture I will try to complete my rough description of\nreligious experience; and in the lecture after that, which is the\nlast one, I will try my hand at formulating conceptually the\ntruth to which it is a witness.",
        "We have wound our way back, after our excursion through mysticism\nand philosophy, to where we were before:  the uses of religion,\nits uses to the individual who has it, and the uses of the\nindividual himself to the world, are the best arguments that\ntruth is in it.  We return to the empirical philosophy:  the true\nis what works well, even though the qualification “on the whole\"\nmay always have to be added.  In this lecture we must revert to\ndescription again, and finish our picture of the religious\nconsciousness by a word about some of its other characteristic\nelements.  Then, in a final lecture, we shall be free to make a\ngeneral review and draw our independent conclusions.",
        "The first point I will speak of is the part which the aesthetic\nlife plays in determining one’s choice of a religion.  Men, I\nsaid awhile ago, involuntarily intellectualize their religious\nexperience.  They need formulas, just as they need fellowship in\nworship.  I spoke, therefore, too contemptuously of the pragmatic\nuselessness of the famous scholastic list of attributes of the\ndeity, for they have one use which I neglected to consider.  The\neloquent passage in which Newman enumerates them[301] puts us on\nthe track of it.  Intoning them as he would intone a cathedral\nservice, he shows how high is their aesthetic value.  It enriches\nour bare piety to carry these exalted and mysterious verbal\nadditions just as it enriches a church to have an organ and old\nbrasses, marbles and frescoes and stained windows.  Epithets lend\nan atmosphere and overtones to our devotion.  They are like a\nhymn of praise and service of glory, and may sound the more\nsublime for being incomprehensible.  Minds like Newman’s[302]\ngrow as jealous of their credit as heathen priests are of that of\nthe jewelry and ornaments that blaze upon their idols.",
        "[301] Idea of a University, Discourse III.  Section 7.",
        "[302] Newman’s imagination so innately craved an ecclesiastical\nsystem that he can write:  “From the age of fifteen, dogma has\nbeen the fundamental principle of my religion:  I know no other\nreligion; I cannot enter into the idea of any other sort of\nreligion.”  And again speaking of himself about the age of\nthirty, he writes:  “I loved to act as feeling myself in my\nBishop’s sight, as if it were the sight of God.”  Apologia, 1897,\npp. 48, 50.",
        "Among the buildings-out of religion which the mind spontaneously\nindulges in, the aesthetic motive must never be forgotten.  I\npromised to say nothing of ecclesiastical systems in these\nlectures.  I may be allowed, however, to put in a word at this\npoint on the way in which their satisfaction of certain aesthetic\nneeds contributes to their hold on human nature.  Although some\npersons aim most at intellectual purity and simplification, for\nothers RICHNESS is the supreme imaginative requirement.[303] When\none’s mind is strongly of this type, an individual religion will\nhardly serve the purpose. The inner need is rather of something\ninstitutional and complex, majestic in the hierarchic\ninterrelatedness of its parts, with authority descending from\nstage to stage, and at every stage objects for adjectives of\nmystery and splendor, derived in the last resort from the Godhead\nwho is the fountain and culmination of the system.  One feels\nthen as if in presence of some vast incrusted work of jewelry or\narchitecture; one hears the multitudinous liturgical appeal; one\ngets the honorific vibration coming from every quarter.  Compared\nwith such a noble complexity, in which ascending and descending\nmovements seem in no way to jar upon stability, in which no\nsingle item, however humble, is insignificant, because so many\naugust institutions hold it in its place, how flat does\nevangelical Protestantism appear, how bare the atmosphere of\nthose isolated religious lives whose boast it is that “man in the\nbush with God may meet.\"[304] What a pulverization and leveling\nof what a gloriously piled-up structure!  To an imagination used\nto the perspectives of dignity and glory, the naked gospel scheme\nseems to offer an almshouse for a palace.",
        "[303] The intellectual difference is quite on a par in practical\nimportance with the analogous difference in character.  We saw,\nunder the head of Saintliness, how some characters resent\nconfusion and must live in purity, consistency, simplicity\n(above, p. 275 ff.).  For others, on the contrary,\nsuperabundance, over-pressure, stimulation, lots of superficial\nrelations, are indispensable.  There are men who would suffer a\nvery syncope if you should pay all their debts, bring it about\nthat their engagements had been kept, their letters answered\ntheir perplexities relieved, and their duties fulfilled, down to\none which lay on a clean table under their eyes with nothing to\ninterfere with its immediate performance.  A day stripped so\nstaringly bare would be for them appalling.  So with ease,\nelegance, tributes of affection, social recognitions–some of us\nrequire amounts of these things which to others would appear a\nmass of lying and sophistication.",
        "[304] In Newman’s Lectures on Justification Lecture VIII. \nSection 6, there is a splendid passage expressive of this\naesthetic way of feeling the Christian scheme.  It is\nunfortunately too long to quote.",
        "It is much like the patriotic sentiment of those brought up in\nancient empires.  How many emotions must be frustrated of their\nobject, when one gives up the titles of dignity, the crimson\nlights and blare of brass, the gold embroidery, the plumed\ntroops, the fear and trembling, and puts up with a president in a\nblack coat who shakes hands with you, and comes, it may be, from\na “home” upon a veldt or prairie with one sitting-room and a\nBible on its centre-table.  It pauperizes the monarchical\nimagination!",
        "The strength of these aesthetic sentiments makes it rigorously\nimpossible, it seems to me, that Protestantism, however superior\nin spiritual profundity it may be to Catholicism, should at the\npresent day succeed in making many converts from the more\nvenerable ecclesiasticism.  The latter offers a so much richer\npasturage and shade to the fancy, has so many cells with so many\ndifferent kinds of honey, is so indulgent in its multiform\nappeals to human nature, that Protestantism will always show to\nCatholic eyes the almshouse physiognomy.  The bitter negativity\nof it is to the Catholic mind incomprehensible.  To intellectual\nCatholics many of the antiquated beliefs and practices to which\nthe Church gives countenance are, if taken literally, as childish\nas they are to Protestants.  But they are childish in the\npleasing sense of “childlike\"–innocent and amiable, and worthy\nto be smiled on in consideration of the undeveloped condition of\nthe dear people’s intellects.  To the Protestant, on the\ncontrary, they are childish in the sense of being idiotic\nfalsehoods.  He must stamp out their delicate and lovable\nredundancy, leaving the Catholic to shudder at his literalness. \nHe appears to the latter as morose as if he were some hard-eyed,\nnumb, monotonous kind of reptile.  The two will never understand\neach other–their centres of emotional energy are too different. \nRigorous truth and human nature’s intricacies are always in need\nof a mutual interpreter.[305] So much for the aesthetic\ndiversities in the religious consciousness.",
        "[305] Compare the informality of Protestantism, where the “meek\nlover of the good,” alone with his God, visits the sick, etc.,\nfor their own sakes, with the elaborate “business” that goes on\nin Catholic devotion, and carries with it the social excitement\nof all more complex businesses.  An essentially worldly-minded\nCatholic woman can become a visitor of the sick on purely\ncoquettish principles, with her confessor and director, her\n\"merit” storing up, her patron saints, her privileged relation to\nthe Almighty, drawing his attention as a professional devote, her\ndefinite “exercises,” and her definitely recognized social pose\nin the organization.",
        "In most books on religion, three things are represented as its\nmost essential elements.  These are Sacrifice, Confession, and\nPrayer.  I must say a word in turn of each of these elements,\nthough briefly.  First of Sacrifice.",
        "Sacrifices to gods are omnipresent in primeval worship; but, as\ncults have grown refined, burnt offerings and the blood of\nhe-goats have been superseded by sacrifices more spiritual in\ntheir nature.  Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism get along without\nritual sacrifice; so does Christianity, save in so far as the\nnotion is preserved in transfigured form in the mystery of\nChrist’s atonement.  These religions substitute offerings of the\nheart, renunciations of the inner self, for all those vain\noblations.  In the ascetic practices which Islam, Buddhism, and\nthe older Christianity encourage we see how indestructible is the\nidea that sacrifice of some sort is a religious exercise.  In\nlecturing on asceticism I spoke of its significance as symbolic\nof the sacrifices which life, whenever it is taken strenuously,\ncalls for.[306]  But, as I said my say about those, and as these\nlectures expressly avoid earlier religious usages and questions\nof derivation, I will pass from the subject of Sacrifice\naltogether and turn to that of Confession.",
        "[306] Above, p. 354 ff.",
        "In regard to Confession I will also be most brief, saying my word\nabout it psychologically, not historically.  Not nearly as\nwidespread as sacrifice, it corresponds to a more inward and\nmoral stage of sentiment.  It is part of the general system of\npurgation and cleansing which one feels one’s self in need of, in\norder to be in right relations to one’s deity.  For him who\nconfesses, shams are over and realities have begun; he has\nexteriorized his rottenness.  If he has not actually got rid of\nit, he at least no longer smears it over with a hypocritical show\nof virtue–he lives at least upon a basis of veracity.  The\ncomplete decay of the practice of confession in Anglo-Saxon\ncommunities is a little hard to account for.  Reaction against\npopery is of course the historic explanation, for in popery\nconfession went with penances and absolution, and other\ninadmissible practices.  But on the <453> side of the sinner\nhimself it seems as if the need ought to have been too great to\naccept so summary a refusal of its satisfaction.  One would think\nthat in more men the shell of secrecy would have had to open, the\npent-in abscess to burst and gain relief, even though the ear\nthat heard the confession were unworthy.  The Catholic church,\nfor obvious utilitarian reasons, has substituted auricular\nconfession to one priest for the more radical act of public\nconfession.  We English-speaking Protestants, in the general\nself-reliance and unsociability of our nature, seem to find it\nenough if we take God alone into our confidence.[307]",
        "[307] A fuller discussion of confession is contained in the\nexcellent work by Frank Granger:  The Soul of a Christian,\nLondon, 1900, ch. xii.",
        "The next topic on which I must comment is Prayer–and this time\nit must be less briefly.  We have heard much talk of late against\nprayer, especially against prayers for better weather and for the\nrecovery of sick people.  As regards prayers for the sick, if any\nmedical fact can be considered to stand firm, it is that in\ncertain environments prayer may contribute to recovery, and\nshould be encouraged as a therapeutic measure.  Being a normal\nfactor of moral health in the person, its omission would be\ndeleterious.  The case of the weather is different. \nNotwithstanding the recency of the opposite belief,[308] every\none now knows that droughts and storms follow from physical\nantecedents, and that moral appeals cannot avert them.  But\npetitional prayer is only one department of prayer; and if we\ntake the word in the wider sense as meaning every kind of inward\ncommunion or conversation with the power recognized as divine, we\ncan easily see that scientific criticism leaves it untouched.",
        "[308] Example:  “The minister at Sudbury, being at the Thursday\nlecture in Boston, heard the officiating clergyman praying for\nrain.  As soon as the service was over, he went to the petitioner\nand said ’You Boston ministers, as soon as a tulip wilts under\nyour windows, go to church and pray for rain, until all Concord\nand Sudbury are under water.’”  R. W. Emerson:  Lectures and\nBiographical Sketches, p. 363.",
        "Prayer in this wide sense is the very soul and essence of\nreligion.  “Religion,” says a liberal French theologian, “is an\nintercourse, a conscious and voluntary relation, entered into by\na soul in distress with the mysterious power upon which it feels\nitself to depend, and upon which its fate is contingent.  This\nintercourse with God is realized by prayer.  Prayer is religion\nin act; that is, prayer is real religion.  It is prayer that\ndistinguishes the religious phenomenon from such similar or\nneighboring phenomena as purely moral or aesthetic sentiment. \nReligion is nothing if it be not the vital act by which the\nentire mind seeks to save itself by clinging to the principle\nfrom which it draws its life.  This act is prayer, by which term\nI understand no vain exercise of words, no mere repetition of\ncertain sacred formula, but the very movement itself of the soul,\nputting itself in a personal relation of contact with the\nmysterious power of which it feels the presence–it may be even\nbefore it has a name by which to call it.  Wherever this interior\nprayer is lacking, there is no religion; wherever, on the other\nhand, this prayer rises and stirs the soul, even in the absence\nof forms or of doctrines, we have living religion.  One sees from\nthis why “natural religion, so-called, is not properly a\nreligion.  It cuts man off from prayer.  It leaves him and God in\nmutual remoteness, with no intimate commerce, no interior\ndialogue, no interchange, no action of God in man, no return of\nman to God.  At bottom this pretended religion is only a\nphilosophy.  Born at epochs of rationalism, of critical\ninvestigations, it never was anything but an abstraction.  An\nartificial and dead creation, it reveals to its examiner hardly\none of the characters proper to religion.\"[309]",
        "[309] Auguste Sabatier:  Esquisse d’une Philosophie de la\nReligion. 2me ed., 1897, pp. 24-26, abridged.",
        "It seems to me that the entire series of our lectures proves the\ntruth of M. Sabatier’s contention.  The religious phenomenon,\nstudied as in Inner fact, and apart from ecclesiastical or\ntheological complications, has shown itself to consist\neverywhere, and at all its stages, in the consciousness which\nindividuals have of an intercourse between themselves and higher\npowers with which they feel themselves to be related. This\nintercourse is realized at the time as being both active and\nmutual.  If it be not effective; if it be not a give and take\nrelation; if nothing be really transacted while it lasts; if the\nworld is in no whit different for its having taken place; then\nprayer, taken in this wide meaning of a sense that SOMETHING IS\nTRANSACTING, is of course a feeling of what is illusory, and\nreligion must on the whole be classed, not simply as containing\nelements of delusion–these undoubtedly everywhere exist–but as\nbeing rooted in delusion altogether, just as materialists and\natheists have always said it was.  At most there might remain,\nwhen the direct experiences of prayer were ruled out as false\nwitnesses, some inferential belief that the whole order of\nexistence must have a divine cause.  But this way of\ncontemplating nature, pleasing as it would doubtless be to\npersons of a pious taste, would leave to them but the spectators’\npart at a play, whereas in experimental religion and the\nprayerful life, we seem ourselves to be actors, and not in a\nplay, but in a very serious reality.",
        "The genuineness of religion is thus indissolubly bound up with\nthe question whether the prayerful consciousness be or be not\ndeceitful.  The conviction that something is genuinely transacted\nin this consciousness is the very core of living religion.  As to\nwhat is transacted, great differences of opinion have prevailed. \nThe unseen powers have been supposed, and are yet supposed, to do\nthings which no enlightened man can nowadays believe in.  It may\nwell prove that the sphere of influence in prayer is subjective\nexclusively, and that what is immediately changed is only the\nmind of the praying person.  But however our opinion of prayer’s\neffects may come to be limited by criticism, religion, in the\nvital sense in which these lectures study it, must stand or fall\nby the persuasion that effects of some sort genuinely do occur. \nThrough prayer, religion insists, things which cannot be realized\nin any other manner come about:  energy which but for prayer\nwould be bound is by prayer set free and operates in some part,\nbe it objective or subjective, of the world of facts.",
        "This postulate is strikingly expressed in a letter written by the\nlate Frederic W. H. Myers to a friend, who allows me to quote\nfrom it.  It shows how independent the prayer-instinct is of\nusual doctrinal complications.  Mr. Myers writes:–",
        "“I am glad that you have asked me about prayer, because I have\nrather strong ideas on the subject.  First consider what are the\nfacts.  There exists around us a spiritual universe, and that\nuniverse is in actual relation with the material.  From the\nspiritual universe comes the energy which maintains the material;\nthe energy which makes the life of each individual spirit.  Our\nspirits are supported by a perpetual indrawal of this energy, and\nthe vigor of that indrawal is perpetually changing, much as the\nvigor of our absorption of material nutriment changes from hour\nto hour.",
        "“I call these ’facts’ because I think that some scheme of this\nkind is the only one consistent with our actual evidence; too\ncomplex to summarize here.  How, then, should we ACT on these\nfacts?  Plainly we must endeavor to draw in as much spiritual\nlife as possible, and we must place our minds in any attitude\nwhich experience shows to be favorable to such indrawal.  PRAYER\nis the general name for that attitude of open and earnest\nexpectancy.  If we then ask to whom to pray, the answer\n(strangely enough) must be that THAT does not much matter.  The\nprayer is not indeed a purely subjective thing;–it means a real\nincrease in intensity of absorption of spiritual power or\ngrace;–but we do not know enough of what takes place in the\nspiritual world to know how the prayer operates;–WHO is\ncognizant of it, or through what channel the grace is given. \nBetter let children pray to Christ, who is at any rate the\nhighest individual spirit of whom we have any knowledge.  But it\nwould be rash to say that Christ himself HEARS US; while to say\nthat GOD hears us is merely to restate the first principle–that\ngrace flows in from the infinite spiritual world.”",
        "Let us reserve the question of the truth or falsehood of the\nbelief that power is absorbed until the next lecture, when our\ndogmatic conclusions, if we have any, must be reached. Let this\nlecture still confine itself to the description of phenomena; and\nas a concrete example of an extreme sort, of the way in which the\nprayerful life may still be led, let me take a case with which\nmost of you must be acquainted, that of George Muller of Bristol,\nwho died in 1898.  Muller’s prayers were of the crassest\npetitional order.  Early in life he resolved on taking certain\nBible promises in literal sincerity, and on letting himself be\nfed, not by his own worldly foresight, but by the Lord’s hand. \nHe had an extraordinarily active and successful career, among the\nfruits of which were the distribution of over two million copies\nof the Scripture text, in different languages; the equipment of\nseveral hundred missionaries; the circulation of more than a\nhundred and eleven million of scriptural books, pamphlets, and\ntracts; the building of five large orphanages, and the keeping\nand educating of thousands of orphans; finally, the establishment\nof schools in which over a hundred and twenty-one thousand\nyouthful and adult pupils were taught. In the course of this work\nMr. Muller received and administered nearly a million and a half\nof pounds sterling, and traveled over two hundred thousand miles\nof sea and land.[310]  During the sixty-eight years of his\nministry, he never owned any property except his clothes and\nfurniture, and cash in hand; and he left, at the age of\neighty-six, an estate worth only a hundred and sixty pounds.",
        "[310] My authority for these statistics is the little work on\nMuller, by Frederic G. Warne, New York, 1898.",
        "His method was to let his general wants be publicly known, but\nnot to acquaint other people with the details of his temporary\nnecessities.  For the relief of the latter, he prayed directly to\nthe Lord, believing that sooner or later prayers are always\nanswered if one have trust enough.  “When I lose such a thing as\na key,” he writes, “I ask the Lord to direct me to it, and I look\nfor an answer to my prayer; when a person with whom I have made\nan appointment does not come, according to the fixed time, and I\nbegin to be inconvenienced by it, I ask the Lord to be pleased to\nhasten him to me, and I look for an answer; when I do not\nunderstand a passage of the word of God, I lift up my heart to\nthe Lord that he would be pleased by his Holy Spirit to instruct\nme, and I expect to be taught, though I do not fix the time when,\nand the manner how it should be; when I am going to minister in\nthe Word, I seek help from the Lord, and . . . am not cast down,\nbut of good cheer because I look for his assistance.”",
        "Muller’s custom was to never run up bills, not even for a week. \n\"As the Lord deals out to us by the day, . . . the week’s payment\nmight become due and we have no money to meet it; and thus those\nwith whom we deal might be inconvenienced by us, and we be found\nacting against the commandment of the Lord:  ’Owe no man\nanything.’ From this day and henceforward whilst the Lord gives\nto us our supplies by the day, we purpose to pay at once for\nevery article as it is purchased, and never to buy anything\nexcept we can pay for it at once, however much it may seem to be\nneeded, and however much those with whom we deal may wish to be\npaid only by the week.”",
        "The articles needed of which Muller speaks were the food, fuel,\netc., of his orphanages.  Somehow, near as they often come to\ngoing without a meal, they hardly ever seem actually to have done\nso.  “Greater and more manifest nearness of the Lord’s presence I\nhave never had than when after breakfast there were no means for\ndinner for more than a hundred persons; or when after dinner\nthere were no means for the tea, and yet the Lord provided the\ntea; and all this without one single human being having been\ninformed about our need. . . .  Through Grace my mind is so fully\nassured of the faithfulness of the Lord, that in the midst of the\ngreatest need, I am enabled in peace to go about my other work. \nIndeed, did not the Lord give me this, which is the result of\ntrusting in him, I should scarcely be able to work at all; for it\nis now comparatively a rare thing that a day comes when I am not\nin need for one or another part of the work.\"[311]",

        "In building his orphanages simply by prayer and faith, Muller\naffirms that his prime motive was “to have something to point to\nas a visible proof that our God and Father is the same faithful\nGod that he ever was–as willing as ever to prove himself the\nliving God, in our day as formerly, to all that put their trust\nin him.\"[312]  For this reason he refused to borrow money for any\nof his enterprises.  “How does it work when we thus anticipate\nGod by going our own way?  We certainly weaken faith instead of\nincreasing it; and each time we work thus a deliverance of our\nown we find it more and more difficult to trust in God, till at\nlast we give way entirely to our natural fallen reason and\nunbelief prevails.  How different if one is enabled to wait God’s\nown time, and to look alone to him for help and deliverance! When\nat last help comes, after many seasons of prayer it may be, how\nsweet it is, and what a present recompense!  Dear Christian\nreader, if you have never walked in this path of obedience\nbefore, do so now, and you will then know experimentally the\nsweetness of the joy which results from it.\"[313]",

        "[313] Op. cit., p. 383, abridged.",
        "When the supplies came in but slowly, Muller always considered\nthat this was for the trial of his faith and patience When his\nfaith and patience had been sufficiently tried, the Lord would\nsend more means.  “And thus it has proved,\"–I quote from his\ndiary–\"for to-day was given me the sum of 2050 pounds, of which\n2000 are for the building fund [of a certain house], and 50 for\npresent necessities.  It is impossible to describe my joy in God\nwhen I received this donation.  I was neither excited nor\nsurprised; for I LOOK out for answers to my prayers.  I BELIEVE\nTHAT GOD HEARS ME.  Yet my heart was so full of joy that I could\nonly SIT before God, and admire him, like David in 2 Samuel vii. \nAt last I cast myself flat down upon my face and burst forth in\nthanksgiving to God and in surrendering my heart afresh to him\nfor his blessed service.\"[314]",

        "George Muller’s is a case extreme in every respect, and in no\nrespect more so than in the extraordinary narrowness of the man’s\nintellectual horizon.  His God was, as he often said, his\nbusiness partner.  He seems to have been for Muller little more\nthan a sort of supernatural clergyman interested in the\ncongregation of tradesmen and others in Bristol who were his\nsaints, and in the orphanages and other enterprises, but\nunpossessed of any of those vaster and wilder and more ideal\nattributes with which the human imagination elsewhere has\ninvested him.  Muller, in short, was absolutely unphilosophical. \nHis intensely private and practical conception of his relations\nwith the Deity continued the traditions of the most primitive\nhuman thought.[315]  When we compare a mind like his with such a\nmind as, for example, Emerson’s or Phillips Brooks’s, we see the\nrange which the religious consciousness covers.",
        "[315] I cannot resist the temptation of quoting an expression of\nan even more primitive style of religious thought, which I find\nin Arber’s English Garland, vol. vii. p. 440.  Robert Lyde, an\nEnglish sailor, along with an English boy, being prisoners on a\nFrench ship in 1689, set upon the crew, of seven Frenchmen,\nkilled two, made the other five prisoners, and brought home the\nship.  Lyde thus describes how in this feat he found his God a\nvery present help in time of trouble:–",
        "“With the assistance of God I kept my feet when they three and\none more did strive to throw me down.  Feeling the Frenchman\nwhich hung about my middle hang very heavy, I said to the boy,\n’Go round the binnacle, and knock down that man that hangeth on\nmy back.’  So the boy did strike him one blow on the head which\nmade him fall. . . . Then I looked about for a marlin spike or\nanything else to strike them withal.  But seeing nothing, I said,\n’LORD! what shall I do?’  Then casting up my eye upon my left\nside, and seeing a marlin spike hanging, I jerked my right arm\nand took hold, and struck the point four times about a quarter of\nan inch deep into the skull of that man that had hold of my left\narm.  [One of the Frenchmen then hauled the marlin spike away\nfrom him.]  But through GOD’S wonderful providence! it either\nfell out of his hand, or else he threw it down, and at this time\nthe Almighty GOD gave me strength enough to take one man in one\nhand, and throw at the other’s head:  and looking about again to\nsee anything to strike them withal, but seeing nothing, I said,\n’LORD! what shall I do now?’  And then it pleased GOD to put me\nin mind of my knife in my pocket.  And although two of the men\nhad hold of my right arm, yet GOD Almighty strengthened me so\nthat I put my right hand into my right pocket, drew out the knife\nand sheath, . . . put it between my legs and drew it out, and\nthen cut the man’s throat with it that had his back to my breast: \nand he immediately dropt down, and scarce ever stirred after.\"–I\nhave slightly abridged Lyde’s narrative.",
        "There is an immense literature relating to answers to petitional\nprayer.  The evangelical journals are filled with such answers,\nand books are devoted to the subject,[316] but for us Muller’s\ncase will suffice.",

        "A less sturdy beggar-like fashion of leading the prayerful life\nis followed by innumerable other Christians.  Persistence in\nleaning on the Almighty for support and guidance will, such\npersons say, bring with it proofs, palpable but much more subtle,\nof his presence and active influence.  The following description\nof a “led” life, by a German writer whom I have already quoted,\nwould no doubt appear to countless Christians in every country as\nif transcribed from their own personal experience.  One finds in\nthis guided sort of life, says Dr. Hilty–",
        "“That books and words (and sometimes people) come to one’s\ncognizance just at the very moment in which one needs them; that\none glides over great dangers as if with shut eyes, remaining\nignorant of what would have terrified one or led one astray,\nuntil the peril is past–this being especially the case with\ntemptations to vanity and sensuality; that paths on which one\nought not to wander are, as it were, hedged off with thorns; but\nthat on the other side great obstacles are suddenly removed; that\nwhen the time has come for something, one suddenly receives a\ncourage that formerly failed, or perceives the root of a matter\nthat until then was concealed, or discovers thoughts, talents,\nyea, even pieces of knowledge and insight, in one’s self, of\nwhich it is impossible to say whence they come; finally, that\npersons help us or decline to help us, favor us or refuse us, as\nif they had to do so against their will, so that often those\nindifferent or even unfriendly to us yield us the greatest\nservice and furtherance.  (God takes often their worldly goods,\nfrom those whom he leads, at just the right moment, when they\nthreaten to impede the effort after higher interests.)",
        "“Besides all this, other noteworthy things come to pass, of which\nit is not easy to give account.  There is no doubt whatever that\nnow one walks continually through ’open doors’ and on the easiest\nroads, with as little care and trouble as it is possible to\nimagine.",
        "“Furthermore one finds one’s self settling one’s affairs neither\ntoo early nor too late, whereas they were wont to be spoiled by\nuntimeliness, even when the preparations had been well laid. In\naddition to this, one does them with perfect tranquillity of\nmind, almost as if they were matters of no consequence, like\nerrands done by us for another person, in which case we usually\nact more calmly than when we act in our own concerns.  Again, one\nfinds that one can WAIT for everything patiently, and that is one\nof life’s great arts.  One finds also that each thing comes duly,\none thing after the other, so that one gains time to make one’s\nfooting sure before advancing farther.  And then every thing\noccurs to us at the right moment, just what we ought to do, etc.,\nand often in a very striking way, just as if a third person were\nkeeping watch over those things which we are in easy danger of\nforgetting.",
        "“Often, too, persons are sent to us at the right time, to offer\nor ask for what is needed, and what we should never have had the\ncourage or resolution to undertake of our own accord.",
        "“Through all these experiences one finds that one is kindly and\ntolerant of other people, even of such as are repulsive,\nnegligent, or ill-willed, for they also are instruments of good\nin God’s hand, and often most efficient ones.  Without these\nthoughts it would be hard for even the best of us always to keep\nour equanimity.  But with the consciousness of divine guidance,\none sees many a thing in life quite differently from what would\notherwise be possible.",
        "“All these are things that every human being KNOWS, who has had\nexperience of them; and of which the most speaking examples could\nbe brought forward.  The highest resources of worldly wisdom are\nunable to attain that which, under divine leading, comes to us of\nits own accord.\"[317]",

        "Such accounts as this shade away into others where the belief is,\nnot that particular events are tempered more towardly to us by a\nsuperintending providence, as a reward for our reliance, but that\nby cultivating the continuous sense of our connection with the\npower that made things as they are, we are tempered more towardly\nfor their reception.  The outward face of nature need not alter,\nbut the expressions of meaning in it alter.  It was dead and is\nalive again. It is like the difference between looking on a\nperson without love, or upon the same person with love.  In the\nlatter case intercourse springs into new vitality.  So when one’s\naffections keep in touch with the divinity of the world’s\nauthorship, fear and egotism fall away; and in the equanimity\nthat follows, one finds in the hours, as they succeed each other,\na series of purely benignant opportunities.  It is as if all\ndoors were opened, and all paths freshly smoothed.  We meet a new\nworld when we meet the old world in the spirit which this kind of\nprayer infuses.",
        "Such a spirit was that of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus.[318]  It\nis that of mind-curers, of the transcendentalists, and of the\nso-called “liberal” Christians.  As an expression of it, I will\nquote a page from one of Martineau’s sermons:–",
        "[318] “Good Heaven!” says Epictetus, “any one thing in the\ncreation is sufficient to demonstrate a Providence, to a humble\nand grateful mind.  The mere possibility of producing milk from\ngrass, cheese from milk, and wool from skins; who formed and\nplanned it?  Ought we not, whether we dig or plough or eat, to\nsing this hymn to God?  Great is God, who has supplied us with\nthese instruments to till the ground; great is God, who has given\nus hands and instruments of digestion, who has given us to grow\ninsensibly and to breathe in sleep.  These things we ought\nforever to celebrate. . . . But because the most of you are\nblind and insensible, there must be some one to fill this\nstation, and lead, in behalf of all men, the hymn to God; for\nwhat else can I do, a lame old man, but sing hymns to God?  Were\nI a nightingale, I would act the part of a nightingale; were I a\nswan, the part of a swan.

We see what all our fathers\nsaw.  And if we cannot find God in your house or in mine, upon\nthe roadside or the margin of the sea; in the bursting seed or\nopening flower; in the day duty or the night musing; in the\ngeneral laugh and the secret grief; in the procession of life,\never entering afresh, and solemnly passing by and dropping off; I\ndo not think we should discern him any more on the grass of Eden,\nor beneath the moonlight of Gethsemane.  Depend upon it, it is\nnot the want of greater miracles, but of the soul to perceive\nsuch as are allowed us still, that makes us push all the\nsanctities into the far spaces we cannot reach.  The devout feel\nthat wherever God’s hand is, THERE is miracle:  and it is simply\nan indevoutness which imagines that only where miracle is, can\nthere be the real hand of God.  The customs of Heaven ought\nsurely to be more sacred in our eyes than its anomalies; the dear\nold ways, of which the Most High is never tired, than the strange\nthings which he does not love well enough ever to repeat.  And he\nwho will but discern beneath the sun, as he rises any morning,\nthe supporting finger of the Almighty, may recover the sweet and\nreverent surprise with which Adam gazed on the first dawn in\nParadise.  It is no outward change, no shifting in time or place;\nbut only the loving meditation of the pure in heart, that can\nreawaken the Eternal from the sleep within our souls:  that can\nrender him a reality again, and reassert for him once more his\nancient name of ’the Living God.’\"[319]",

It was impossible to conceive more nerve or\nspirit, better time or measure, more clearness or richness, than\nwere in this drumming.  Ideal desire could go no farther in that\ndirection.

Through prayer\nthe purpose, often far from obvious, comes home to them, and if\nit be “trial,” strength to endure the trial is given.  Thus at\nall stages of the prayerful life we find the persuasion that in\nthe process of communion energy from on high flows in to meet\ndemand, and becomes operative within the phenomenal world.  So\nlong as this operativeness is admitted to be real, it makes no\nessential difference whether its immediate effects be subjective\nor objective. The fundamental religious point is that in prayer,\nspiritual energy, which otherwise would slumber, does become\nactive, and spiritual work of some kind is effected really.",

        "The last aspect of the religious life which remains for me to\ntouch upon is the fact that its manifestations so frequently\nconnect themselves with the subconscious part of our existence.\nYou may remember what I said in my opening lecture[323] about the\nprevalence of the psychopathic temperament in religious\nbiography.  You will in point of fact hardly find a religious\nleader of any kind in whose life there is no record of\nautomatisms.  I speak not merely of savage priests and prophets,\nwhose followers regard automatic utterance and action as by\nitself tantamount to inspiration, I speak of leaders of thought\nand subjects of intellectualized experience.  Saint Paul had his\nvisions, his ecstasies, his gift of tongues, small as was the\nimportance he attached to the latter. The whole array of\nChristian saints and heresiarchs, including the greatest, the\nBarnards, the Loyolas, the Luthers, the Foxes, the Wesleys, had\ntheir visions, voices, rapt conditions, guiding impressions, and\n\"openings.”    They had these things, because they had exalted\nsensibility, and to such things persons of exalted sensibility\nare liable.  In such liability there lie, however, consequences\nfor theology.  Beliefs are strengthened wherever automatisms\ncorroborate them.  Incursions from beyond the transmarginal\nregion have a peculiar power to increase conviction.  The\ninchoate sense of presence is infinitely stronger than\nconception, but strong as it may be, it is seldom equal to the\nevidence of hallucination.  Saints who actually see or hear their\nSaviour reach the acme of assurance.  Motor automatisms, though\nrarer, are, if possible, even more convincing than sensations. \nThe subjects here actually feel themselves played upon by powers\nbeyond their will.  The evidence is dynamic; the God or spirit\nmoves the very organs of their body.[324]",

        "[324] A friend of mine, a first-rate psychologist, who is a\nsubject of graphic automatism, tells me that the appearance of\nindependent actuation in the movements of his arm, when he writes\nautomatically, is so distinct that it obliges him to abandon a\npsychophysical theory which he had previously believed in, the\ntheory, namely, that we have no feeling of the discharge\ndownwards of our voluntary motor-centres.  We must normally have\nsuch a feeling, he thinks, or the SENSE OF AN ABSENCE would not\nbe so striking as it is in these experiences.  Graphic automatism\nof a fully developed kind is rare in religious history, so far as\nmy knowledge goes.  Such statements as Antonia Bourignon’s, that\n\"I do nothing but lend my hand and spirit to another power than\nmine,” is shown by the context to indicate inspiration rather\nthan directly automatic writing.  In some eccentric sects this\nlatter occurs.  The most striking instance of it is probably the\nbulky volume called, “Oahspe, a new Bible in the Words of Jehovah\nand his angel ambassadors,” Boston and London, 1891, written and\nillustrated automatically by Dr. Newbrough of New York, whom I\nunderstand to be now, or to have been lately, at the head of the\nspiritistic community of Shalam in New Mexico.  The latest\nautomatically written book which has come under my notice is\n\"Zertouhem’s Wisdom of the Ages,” by George A. Fuller, Boston,\n1901.",
        "The great field for this sense of being the instrument of a\nhigher power is of course “inspiration.”  It is easy to\ndiscriminate between the religious leaders who have been\nhabitually subject to inspiration and those who have not.  In the\nteachings of the Buddha, of Jesus, of Saint Paul (apart from his\ngift of tongues), of Saint Augustine, of Huss, of Luther, of\nWesley, automatic or semi-automatic composition appears to have\nbeen only occasional.  In the Hebrew prophets, on the contrary,\nin Mohammed, in some of the Alexandrians, in many minor Catholic\nsaints, in Fox, in Joseph Smith, something like it appears to\nhave been frequent, sometimes habitual.  We have distinct\nprofessions of being under the direction of a foreign power, and\nserving as its mouthpiece.  As regards the Hebrew prophets, it is\nextraordinary, writes an author who has made a careful study of\nthem, to see–",
        "“How, one after another, the same features are reproduced in the\nprophetic books.  The process is always extremely different from\nwhat it would be if the prophet arrived at his insight into\nspiritual things by the tentative efforts of his own genius.\nThere is something sharp and sudden about it.  He can lay his\nfinger, so to speak, on the moment when it came.  And it always\ncomes in the form of an overpowering force from without, against\nwhich he struggles, but in vain.  Listen, for instance, [to] the\nopening of the book of Jeremiah.  Read through in like manner the\nfirst two chapters of the prophecy of Ezekiel.",
        "“It is not, however, only at the beginning of his career that the\nprophet passes through a crisis which is clearly not self-\ncaused.  Scattered all through the prophetic writings are\nexpressions which speak of some strong and irresistible impulse\ncoming down upon the prophet, determining his attitude to the\nevents of his time, constraining his utterance, making his words\nthe vehicle of a higher meaning than their own.  For instance,\nthis of Isaiah’s:  ’The Lord spake thus to me with a strong\nhand,’–an emphatic phrase which denotes the overmastering nature\nof the impulse–’and instructed me that I should not walk in the\nway of this people.’ . . . Or passages like this from Ezekiel: \n’The hand of the Lord God fell upon me,’ ’The hand of the Lord\nwas strong upon me.’ The one standing characteristic of the\nprophet is that he speaks with the authority of Jehovah himself. \nHence it is that the prophets one and all preface their addresses\nso confidently, ’The Word of the Lord,’ or ’Thus saith the Lord.’\nThey have even the audacity to speak in the first person, as if\nJehovah himself were speaking.  As in Isaiah:  ’Hearken unto me,\nO Jacob, and Israel my called; I am He, I am the First, I also am\nthe last,’–and so on.  The personality of the prophet sinks\nentirely into the background; he feels himself for the time being\nthe mouthpiece of the Almighty.\"[325]",

        "“We need to remember that prophecy was a profession, and that the\nprophets formed a professional class.  There were schools of the\nprophets, in which the gift was regularly cultivated.  A group of\nyoung men would gather round some commanding figure–a Samuel or\nan Elisha–and would not only record or spread the knowledge of\nhis sayings and doings, but seek to catch themselves something of\nhis inspiration.  It seems that music played its part in their\nexercises. . . .  It is perfectly clear that by no means all of\nthese Sons of the prophets ever succeeded in acquiring more than\na very small share in the gift which they sought.  It was clearly\npossible to ’counterfeit’ prophecy.  Sometimes this was done\ndeliberately. . . .  But it by no means follows that in all cases\nwhere a false message was given, the giver of it was altogether\nconscious of what he was doing.[326]",

        "Here, to take another Jewish case, is the way in which Philo of\nAlexandria describes his inspiration:–",
        "“Sometimes, when I have come to my work empty, I have suddenly\nbecome full; ideas being in an invisible manner showered upon me,\nand implanted in me from on high; so that through the influence\nof divine inspiration, I have become greatly excited, and have\nknown neither the place in which I was, nor those who were\npresent, nor myself, nor what I was saying, nor what I was\nwriting, for then I have been conscious of a richness of\ninterpretation, an enjoyment of light, a most penetrating\ninsight, a most manifest energy in all that was to be done;\nhaving such effect on my mind as the clearest ocular\ndemonstration would have on the eyes.\"[327]",

        "If we turn to Islam, we find that Mohammed’s revelations all came\nfrom the subconscious sphere.  To the question in what way he got\nthem–",
        "“Mohammed is said to have answered that sometimes he heard a\nknell as from a bell, and that this had the strongest effect on\nhim; and when the angel went away, he had received the\nrevelation.  Sometimes again he held converse with the angel as\nwith a man, so as easily to understand his words.  The later\nauthorities, however, . . . distinguish still other kinds.  In\nthe Itgan (103) the following are enumerated:  1, revelations\nwith sound of bell, 2, by inspiration of the holy spirit in M.’s\nheart, 3, by Gabriel in human form, 4, by God immediately, either\nwhen awake (as in his journey to heaven) or in dream. . . . In\nAlmawahib alladuniya the kinds are thus given:  1, Dream, 2,\nInspiration of Gabriel in the Prophet’s heart, 3, Gabriel taking\nDahya’s form, 4, with the bell-sound, etc., 5, Gabriel in propria\npersona (only twice), 6, revelation in heaven, 7, God appearing\nin person, but veiled, 8, God revealing himself immediately\nwithout veil.  Others add two other stages, namely:  1, Gabriel\nin the form of still another man, 2, God showing himself\npersonally in dream.\"[328]",

        "In none of these cases is the revelation distinctly motor. In the\ncase of Joseph Smith (who had prophetic revelations innumerable\nin addition to the revealed translation of the <472> gold plates\nwhich resulted in the Book of Mormon), although there may have\nbeen a motor element, the inspiration seems to have been\npredominantly sensorial.  He began his translation by the aid of\nthe “peep-stones” which he found, or thought or said that he\nfound, with the gold plates –apparently a case of “crystal\ngazing.”  For some of the other revelations he used the\npeep-stones, but seems generally to have asked the Lord for more\ndirect instruction.[329]",
        "[329] The Mormon theocracy has always been governed by direct\nrevelations accorded to the President of the Church and its\nApostles.  From an obliging letter written to me in 1899 by an\neminent Mormon, I quote the following extract:–",
        "“It may be very interesting for you to know that the President\n[Mr. Snow] of the Mormon Church claims to have had a number of\nrevelations very recently from heaven.  To explain fully what\nthese revelations are, it is necessary to know that we, as a\npeople, believe that the Church of Jesus Christ has again been\nestablished through messengers sent from heaven.  This Church has\nat its head a prophet seer, and revelator, who gives to man God’s\nholy will.  Revelation is the means through which the will of God\nis declared directly and in fullness to man.  These revelations\nare got through dreams of sleep or in waking visions of the mind,\nby voices without visional appearance or by actual manifestations\nof the Holy Presence before the eye.  We believe that God has\ncome in person and spoken to our prophet and revelator.”",
        "Other revelations are described as “openings\"–Fox’s, for\nexample, were evidently of the kind known in spiritistic circles\nof to-day as “impressions.”  As all effective initiators of\nchange must needs live to some degree upon this psychopathic\nlevel of sudden perception or conviction of new truth, or of\nimpulse to action so obsessive that it must be worked off, I will\nsay nothing more about so very common a phenomenon.",
        "When, in addition to these phenomena of inspiration, we take\nreligious mysticism into the account, when we recall the striking\nand sudden unifications of a discordant self which we saw in\nconversion, and when we review the extravagant obsessions of\ntenderness, purity, and self-severity met with in saintliness, we\ncannot, I think, avoid the conclusion that in religion we have a\ndepartment of human nature with unusually close relations to the\ntransmarginal or subliminal region.  If the word “subliminal” is\noffensive to any of you, as smelling too much of psychical\nresearch or other aberrations, call it by any other name you\nplease, to distinguish it from the level of full sunlit\nconsciousness.  Call this latter the A-region of personality, if\nyou care to, and call the other the B-region.  The B-region,\nthen, is obviously the larger part of each of us, for it is the\nabode of everything that is latent and the reservoir of\neverything that passes unrecorded or unobserved.  It contains,\nfor example, such things as all our momentarily inactive\nmemories, and it harbors the springs of all our obscurely motived\npassions, impulses, likes, dislikes, and prejudices.  Our\nintuitions, hypotheses, fancies, superstitions, persuasions,\nconvictions, and in general all our non-rational operations, come\nfrom it.  It is the source of our dreams, and apparently they may\nreturn to it.  In it arise whatever mystical experiences we may\nhave, and our automatisms, sensory or motor; our life in hypnotic\nand “hypnoid” conditions, if we are subjects to such conditions;\nour delusions, fixed ideas, and hysterical accidents, if we are\nhysteric subjects; our supra-normal cognitions, if such there be,\nand if we are telepathic subjects.  It is also the fountain-head\nof much that feeds our religion. In persons deep in the religious\nlife, as we have now abundantly seen–and this is my\nconclusion–the door into this region seems unusually wide open;\nat any rate, experiences making their entrance through that door\nhave had emphatic influence in shaping religious history.",
        "With this conclusion I turn back and close the circle which I\nopened in my first lecture, terminating thus the review which I\nthen announced of inner religious phenomena as we find them in\ndeveloped and articulate human individuals.  I might easily, if\nthe time allowed, multiply both my documents and my\ndiscriminations, but a broad treatment is, I believe, in itself\nbetter, and the most important characteristics of the subject\nlie, I think, before us already. In the next lecture, which is\nalso the last one, we must try to draw the critical conclusions\nwhich so much material may suggest.",
        "The material of our study of human nature is now spread before\nus; and in this parting hour, set free from the duty of\ndescription, we can draw our theoretical and practical\nconclusions.  In my first lecture, defending the empirical\nmethod, I foretold that whatever conclusions we might come to\ncould be reached by spiritual judgments only, appreciations of\nthe significance for life of religion, taken “on the whole.”   \nOur conclusions cannot be as sharp as dogmatic conclusions would\nbe, but I will formulate them, when the time comes, as sharply as\nI can.",
        "Summing up in the broadest possible way the characteristics of\nthe religious life, as we have found them, it includes the\nfollowing beliefs:–",
        "1.  That the visible world is part of a more spiritual universe\nfrom which it draws its chief significance;",
        "2.  That union or harmonious relation with that higher universe\nis our true end;",
        "3.  That prayer or inner communion with the spirit thereof– be\nthat spirit “God” or “law\"–is a process wherein work is really\ndone, and spiritual energy flows in and produces effects,\npsychological or material, within the phenomenal world.",
        "Religion includes also the following psychological\ncharacteristics:–",
        "4.  A new zest which adds itself like a gift to life, and takes\nthe form either of lyrical enchantment or of appeal to\nearnestness and heroism.",
        "5.  An assurance of safety and a temper of peace, and, in\nrelation to others, a preponderance of loving affections.",
        "In illustrating these characteristics by documents, we have been\nliterally bathed in sentiment.  In re-reading my manuscript, I am\nalmost appalled at the amount of emotionality which I find in it.",
        "After so much of this, we can afford to be dryer and less\nsympathetic in the rest of the work that lies before us.",
        "The sentimentality of many of my documents is a consequence of\nthe fact that I sought them among the extravagances of the\nsubject.  If any of you are enemies of what our ancestors used to\nbrand as enthusiasm, and are, nevertheless, still listening to me\nnow, you have probably felt my selection to have been sometimes\nalmost perverse, and have wished I might have stuck to soberer\nexamples.  I reply that I took these extremer examples as\nyielding the profounder information.  To learn the secrets of any\nscience, we go to expert specialists, even though they may be\neccentric persons, and not to commonplace pupils.  We combine\nwhat they tell us with the rest of our wisdom, and form our final\njudgment independently.  Even so with religion.  We who have\npursued such radical expressions of it may now be sure that we\nknow its secrets as authentically as anyone can know them who\nlearns them from another; and we have next to answer, each of us\nfor himself, the practical question:  what are the dangers in\nthis element of life?  and in what proportion may it need to be\nrestrained by other elements, to give the proper balance?",
        "But this question suggests another one which I will answer\nimmediately and get it out of the way, for it has more than once\nalready vexed us.[330] Ought it to be assumed that in all men the\nmixture of religion with other elements should be identical? \nOught it, indeed, to be assumed that the lives of all men should\nshow identical religious elements?  In other words, is the\nexistence of so many religious types and sects and creeds\nregrettable?",
        "[330] For example, on pages 135, 160, 326 above.",
        "To these questions I answer “No” emphatically.  And my reason is\nthat I do not see how it is possible that creatures in such\ndifferent positions and with such different powers as human\nindividuals are, should have exactly the same functions and the\nsame duties.  No two of us have identical difficulties, nor\nshould we be expected to work out identical solutions.  Each,\nfrom his peculiar angle of observation, takes in a certain sphere\nof fact and trouble, which each must deal with in a unique\nmanner.  One of us must soften himself, another must harden\nhimself; one must yield a point, another must stand firm–in\norder the better to defend the position assigned him.  If an\nEmerson were forced to be a Wesley, or a Moody forced to be a\nWhitman, the total human consciousness of the divine would\nsuffer.  The divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a\ngroup of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation,\ndifferent men may all find worthy missions.  Each attitude being\na syllable in human nature’s total message, it takes the whole of\nus to spell the meaning out completely.  So a “god of battles\"\nmust be allowed to be the god for one kind of person, a god of\npeace and heaven and home, the god for another.  We must frankly\nrecognize the fact that we live in partial systems, and that\nparts are not interchangeable in the spiritual life.  If we are\npeevish and jealous, destruction of the self must be an element\nof our religion; why need it be one if we are good and\nsympathetic from the outset?  If we are sick souls, we require a\nreligion of deliverance; but why think so much of deliverance, if\nwe are healthy-minded?[331]  Unquestionably, some men have the \ncompleter experience and the higher vocation, here just as in the\nsocial world; but for each man to stay in his own experience,\nwhate’er it be, and for others to tolerate him there, is surely\nbest.",
        "[331] From this point of view, the contrasts between the healthy\nand the morbid mind, and between the once-born and the twice-born\ntypes, of which I spoke in earlier lectures (see pp. 159-164),\ncease to be the radical antagonisms which many think them.  The\ntwice-born look down upon the rectilinear consciousness of life\nof the once-born as being “mere morality,” and not properly\nreligion.  “Dr. Channing,” an orthodox minister is reported to\nhave said, “is excluded from the highest form of religious life\nby the extraordinary rectitude of his character.”  It is indeed\ntrue that the outlook upon life of the twice-born–holding as it\ndoes more of the element of evil in solution–is the wider and\ncompleter.  The “heroic” or “solemn” way in which life comes to\nthem is a “higher synthesis” into which healthy- mindedness and\nmorbidness both enter and combine.  Evil is not evaded, but\nsublated in the higher religious cheer of these persons (see pp.\n47-52, 354-357).  But the final consciousness which each type\nreaches of union with the divine has the same practical\nsignificance for the individual; and individuals may well be\nallowed to get to it by the channels which lie most open to their\nseveral temperaments.  In the cases which were quoted in Lecture\nIV, of the mind-cure form of healthy-mindedness, we found\nabundant examples of regenerative process.  The severity of the\ncrisis in this process is a matter of degree.  How long one shall\ncontinue to drink the consciousness of evil, and when one shall\nbegin to short-circuit and get rid of it, are also matters of\namount and degree, so that in many instances it is quite\narbitrary whether we class the individual as a once-born or a\ntwice-born subject.",
        "But, you may now ask, would not this one-sidedness be cured if we\nshould all espouse the science of religions as our own religion? \nIn answering this question I must open again the general\nrelations of the theoretic to the active life.",
        "Knowledge about a thing is not the thing itself.  You remember\nwhat Al-Ghazzali told us in the Lecture on Mysticism–that to\nunderstand the causes of drunkenness, as a physician understands\nthem, is not to be drunk.  A science might come to understand\neverything about the causes and elements of religion, and might\neven decide which elements were qualified, by their general\nharmony with other branches of knowledge, to be considered true;\nand yet the best man at this science might be the man who found\nit hardest to be personally devout.  Tout savoir c’est tout\npardonner.  The name of Renan would doubtless occur to many\npersons as an example of the way in which breadth of knowledge\nmay make one only a dilettante in possibilities, and blunt the\nacuteness of one’s living faith.[332]  If religion be a function\nby which either God’s cause or man’s cause is to be really\nadvanced, then he who lives the life of it, however narrowly, is\na better servant than he who merely knows about it, however much. \nKnowledge about life is one thing; effective occupation of a\nplace in life, with its dynamic currents passing through your\nbeing, is another.",
        "[332] Compare, e.g., the quotation from Renan on p. 37, above.",
        "For this reason, the science of religions may not be an\nequivalent for living religion; and if we turn to the inner\ndifficulties of such a science, we see that a point comes when\nshe must drop the purely theoretic attitude, and either let her\nknots remain uncut, or have them cut by active faith.  To see\nthis, suppose that we have our science of religions constituted\nas a matter of fact.  Suppose that she has assimilated all the\nnecessary historical material and distilled out of it as its\nessence the same conclusions which I myself a few moments ago\npronounced.  Suppose that she agrees that religion, wherever it\nis an active thing, involves a belief in ideal presences, and a\nbelief that in our prayerful communion with them,[333] work is\ndone, and something real comes to pass.  She has now to exert her\ncritical activity, and to decide how far, in the light of other\nsciences and in that of general philosophy, such beliefs can be\nconsidered TRUE.",
        "[333] “Prayerful” taken in the broader sense explained above on\npp. 453 ff.",
        "Dogmatically to decide this is an impossible task.  Not only are\nthe other sciences and the philosophy still far from being\ncompleted, but in their present state we find them full of\nconflicts.  The sciences of nature know nothing of spiritual\npresences, and on the whole hold no practical commerce whatever\nwith the idealistic conceptions towards which general philosophy\ninclines.  The scientist, so-called, is, during his scientific\nhours at least, so materialistic that one may well say that on\nthe whole the influence of science goes against the notion that\nreligion should be recognized at all.  And this antipathy to\nreligion finds an echo within the very science of religions\nitself.  The cultivator of this science has to become acquainted\nwith so many groveling and horrible superstitions that a\npresumption easily arises in his mind that any belief that is\nreligious probably is false.  In the “prayerful communion” of\nsavages with such mumbo-jumbos of deities as they acknowledge, it\nis hard for us to see what genuine spiritual work–even though it\nwere work relative only to their dark savage obligations– can\npossibly be done.",
        "The consequence is that the conclusions of the science of\nreligions are as likely to be adverse as they are to be favorable\nto the claim that the essence of religion is true.  There is a\nnotion in the air about us that religion is probably only an\nanachronism, a case of “survival,” an atavistic relapse into a\nmode of thought which humanity in its more enlightened examples\nhas outgrown; and this notion our religious anthropologists at\npresent do little to counteract.",
        "This view is so widespread at the present day that I must\nconsider it with some explicitness before I pass to my own\nconclusions.  Let me call it the “Survival theory,” for brevity’s\nsake.",
        "The pivot round which the religious life, as we have traced it,\nrevolves, is the interest of the individual in his private\npersonal destiny.  Religion, in short, is a monumental chapter in\nthe history of human egotism.  The gods believed in–whether by\ncrude savages or by men disciplined intellectually–agree with\neach other in recognizing personal calls.  Religious thought is\ncarried on in terms of personality, this being, in the world of\nreligion, the one fundamental fact.  To-day, quite as much as at\nany previous age, the religious individual tells you that the\ndivine meets him on the basis of his personal concerns.",
        "Science, on the other hand, has ended by utterly repudiating the\npersonal point of view.  She catalogues her elements and records\nher laws indifferent as to what purpose may be shown forth by\nthem, and constructs her theories quite careless of their bearing\non human anxieties and fates. Though the scientist may\nindividually nourish a religion, and be a theist in his\nirresponsible hours, the days are over when it could be said that\nfor Science herself the heavens declare the glory of God and the\nfirmament showeth his handiwork.  Our solar system, with its\nharmonies, is seen now as but one passing case of a certain sort\nof moving equilibrium in the heavens, realized by a local\naccident in an appalling wilderness of worlds where no life can\nexist. In a span of time which as a cosmic interval will count\nbut as an hour, it will have ceased to be.  The Darwinian notion\nof chance production, and subsequent destruction, speedy or\ndeferred, applies to the largest as well as to the smallest\nfacts.  It is impossible, in the present temper of the scientific\nimagination, to find in the driftings of the cosmic atoms,\nwhether they work on the universal or on the particular scale,\nanything but a kind of aimless weather, doing and undoing,\nachieving no proper history, and leaving no result. Nature has no\none distinguishable ultimate tendency with which it is possible\nto feel a sympathy.  In the vast rhythm of her processes, as the\nscientific mind now follows them, she appears to cancel herself. \nThe books of natural theology which satisfied the intellects of\nour grandfathers seem to us quite grotesque,[334] representing,\nas they did, a God who conformed the largest things of nature to\nthe paltriest of our private wants.  The God whom science\nrecognizes must be a God of universal laws exclusively, a God who\ndoes a wholesale, not a retail business.  He cannot accommodate\nhis processes to the convenience of individuals.  The bubbles on\nthe foam which coats a stormy sea are floating episodes, made and\nunmade by the forces of the wind and water.  Our private selves\nare like those bubbles–epiphenomena, as Clifford, I believe,\ningeniously called them; their destinies weigh nothing and\ndetermine nothing in the world’s irremediable currents of events.",
        "[334] How was it ever conceivable, we ask, that a man like\nChristian Wolff, in whose dry-as-dust head all the learning of\nthe early eighteenth century was concentrated, should have\npreserved such a baby-like faith in the personal and human\ncharacter of Nature as to expound her operations as he did in his\nwork on the uses of natural things?  This, for example, is the\naccount he gives of the sun and its utility:–",
        "“We see that God has created the sun to keep the changeable\nconditions on the earth in such an order that living creatures,\nmen and beasts, may inhabit its surface.  Since men are the most\nreasonable of creatures, and able to infer God’s invisible being\nfrom the contemplation of the world, the sun in so far forth\ncontributes to the primary purpose of creation:  without it the\nrace of man could not be preserved or continued. . . . The sun\nmakes daylight, not only on our earth, but also on the other\nplanets; and daylight is of the utmost utility to us, for by its\nmeans we can commodiously carry on those occupations which in the\nnight-time would either be quite impossible.  Or at any rate\nimpossible without our going to the expense of artificial light. \nThe beasts of the field can find food by day which they would not\nbe able to find at night.  Moreover we owe it to the sunlight\nthat we are able to see everything that is on the earth’s\nsurface, not only near by, but also at a distance, and to\nrecognize both near and far things according to their species,\nwhich again is of manifold use to us not only in the business\nnecessary to human life, and when we are traveling, but also for\nthe scientific knowledge of Nature, which knowledge for the most\npart depends on observations made with the help of sight, and\nwithout the sunshine, would have been impossible.  If any one\nwould rightly impress on his mind the great advantages which he\nderives from the sun, let him imagine himself living through only\none month, and see how it would be with all his undertakings, if\nit were not day but night.  He would then be sufficiently\nconvinced out of his own experience, especially if he had much\nwork to carry on in the street or in the fields. . . . From the\nsun we learn to recognize when it is midday, and by knowing this\npoint of time exactly, we can set our clocks right, on which\naccount astronomy owes much to the sun. . . . By help of the sun\none can find the meridian. . . . But the meridian is the basis\nof our sun-dials, and generally speaking, we should have no\nsun-dials if we had no sun.” Vernunftige Gedanken von den\nAbsichter der naturlichen Dinge, 1782. pp.74-84.",
        "Or read the account of God’s beneficence in the institution of\n\"the great variety throughout the world of men’s faces, voices,\nand hand-writing,” given in Derham’s Physico-theology, a book\nthat had much vogue in the eighteenth century.  “Had Man’s body,\"\nsays Dr. Derham, “been made according to any of the Atheistical\nSchemes, or any other Method than that of the infinite Lord of\nthe World, this wise Variety would never have been:  but Men’s\nFaces would have been cast in the same, or not a very different\nMould, their Organs of Speech would have sounded the same or not\nso great a Variety of Notes, and the same Structure of Muscles\nand Nerves would have given the Hand the same Direction in\nWriting.  And in this Case what Confusion, what Disturbance, what\nMischiefs would the world eternally have lain under!  No Security\ncould have been to our persons; no Certainty, no Enjoyment of our\nPossessions; no Justice between Man and Man, no Distinction\nbetween Good and Bad, between Friends and Foes, between Father\nand Child, Husband and Wife, Male or Female; but all would have\nbeen turned topsy-turvy, by being exposed to the Malice of the\nEnvious and ill-Natured, to the Fraud and Violence of Knaves and\nRobbers, to the Forgeries of the crafty Cheat, to the Lusts of\nthe Effeminate and Debauched, and what not!  Our Courts of\nJustice can abundantly testify the dire Effects of Mistaking\nMen’s Faces, of counterfeiting their Hands, and forging Writings.",
        "But now as the infinitely wise Creator and Ruler hath ordered the\nMatter, every man’s Face can distinguish him in the Light, and\nhis Voice in the Dark, his Hand-writing can speak for him though\nabsent, and be his Witness, and secure his Contracts in future\nGenerations.  A manifest as well as admirable Indication of the\ndivine Superintendence and Management.”",
        "A God so careful as to make provision even for the unmistakable\nsigning of bank checks and deeds was a deity truly after the\nheart of eighteenth century Anglicanism.",
        "I subjoin, omitting the capitals, Derham’s “Vindication of God by\nthe Institution of Hills and Valleys,” and Wolff’s altogether\nculinary account of the institution of Water:–",
        "“The uses,” says Wolff, “which water serves in human life are\nplain to see and need not be described at length.  Water is a\nuniversal drink of man and beasts.  Even though men have made\nthemselves drinks that are artificial, they could not do this\nwithout water.  Beer is brewed of water and malt, and it is the\nwater in it which quenches thirst.  Wine is prepared from grapes,\nwhich could never have grown without the help of water; and the\nsame is true of those drinks which in England and other places\nthey produce from fruit. . . . Therefore since God so planned the\nworld that men and beasts should live upon it and find there\neverything required for their necessity and convenience, he also\nmade water as one means whereby to make the earth into so\nexcellent a dwelling.  And this is all the more manifest when we\nconsider the advantages which we obtain from this same water for\nthe cleaning of our household utensils, of our clothing, and of\nother matters. . . . When one goes into a grinding-mill one sees\nthat the grindstone must always be kept wet and then one will get\na still greater idea of the use of water.”",
        "Of the hills and valleys, Derham, after praising their beauty,\ndiscourses as follows:  “Some constitutions are indeed of so\nhappy a strength, and so confirmed an health, as to be\nindifferent to almost any place or temperature of the air.  But\nthen others are so weakly and feeble, as not to be able to bear\none, but can live comfortably in another place.  With some the\nmore subtle and finer air of the hills doth best agree, who are\nlanguishing and dying in the feculent and grosser air of great\ntowns, or even the warmer and vaporous air of the valleys and\nwaters.  But contrariwise, others languish on the hills, and grow\nlusty and strong in the warmer air of the valleys.",
        "“So that this opportunity of shifting our abode from the hills to\nthe vales, is an admirable easement, refreshment, and great\nbenefit to the valetudinarian, feeble part of mankind; affording\nthose an easy and comfortable life, who would otherwise live\nmiserably, languish, and pine away.",
        "“To this salutary conformation of the earth we may add another\ngreat convenience of the hills, and that is affording commodious\nplaces for habitation, serving (as an eminent author wordeth it)\nas screens to keep off the cold and nipping blasts of the\nnorthern and easterly winds, and reflecting the benign and\ncherishing sunbeams and so rendering our habitations both more\ncomfortable and more cheerly in winter.",
        "“Lastly, it is to the hills that the fountains owe their rise and\nthe rivers their conveyance, and consequently those vast masses\nand lofty piles are not, as they are charged such rude and\nuseless excrescences of our ill-formed globe; but the admirable\ntools of nature, contrived and ordered by the infinite Creator,\nto do one of its most useful works.  For, was the surface of the\nearth even and level, and the middle parts of its islands and\ncontinents not mountainous and high as now it is, it is most\ncertain there could be no descent for the rivers, no conveyance\nfor the waters; but, instead of gliding along those gentle\ndeclivities which the higher lands now afford them quite down to\nthe sea, they would stagnate and perhaps stink, and also drown\nlarge tracts of land.",
        "“[Thus] the hills and vales, though to a peevish and weary\ntraveler they may seem incommodious and troublesome, yet are a\nnoble work of the great Creator, and wisely appointed by him for\nthe good of our sublunary world.”  ",
        "You see how natural it is, from this point of view, to treat\nreligion as a mere survival, for religion does in fact perpetuate\nthe traditions of the most primeval thought.  To coerce the\nspiritual powers, or to square them and get them on our side,\nwas, during enormous tracts of time, the one great object in our\ndealings with the natural world.  For our ancestors, dreams,\nhallucinations, revelations, and cock-and-bull stories were\ninextricably mixed with facts.  Up to a comparatively recent date\nsuch distinctions as those between what has been verified and\nwhat is only conjectured, between the impersonal and the personal\naspects of existence, were hardly suspected or conceived. \nWhatever you imagined in a lively manner, whatever you thought\nfit to be true, you affirmed confidently; and whatever you\naffirmed, your comrades believed.  Truth was what had not yet\nbeen contradicted, most things were taken into the mind from the\npoint of view of their human suggestiveness, and the attention\nconfined itself exclusively to the aesthetic and dramatic aspects\nof events.[335]",
        "[335] Until the seventeenth century this mode of thought\nprevailed. One need only recall the dramatic treatment even of\nmechanical questions by Aristotle, as, for example, his\nexplanation of the power of the lever to make a small weight\nraise a larger one.  This is due, according to Aristotle, to the\ngenerally miraculous character of the circle and of all circular\nmovement.  The circle is both convex and concave; it is made by a\nfixed point and a moving line, which contradict each other; and\nwhatever moves in a circle moves in opposite directions. \nNevertheless, movement in a circle is the most “natural\"\nmovement; and the long arm of the lever, moving, as it does, in\nthe larger circle, has the greater amount of this natural motion,\nand consequently requires the lesser force.  Or recall the\nexplanation by Herodotus of the position of the sun in winter: \nIt moves to the south because of the cold which drives it into\nthe warm parts of the heavens over Libya.  Or listen to Saint\nAugustine’s speculations:  “Who gave to chaff such power to\nfreeze that it preserves snow buried under it, and such power to\nwarm that it ripens green fruit?  Who can explain the strange\nproperties of fire itself, which blackens all that it burns,\nthough itself bright, and which, though of the most beautiful\ncolors, discolors almost all that it touches and feeds upon, and\nturns blazing fuel into grimy cinders? . . . Then what wonderful\nproperties do we find in charcoal, which is so brittle that a\nlight tap breaks it, and a slight pressure pulverizes it, and yet\nis so strong that no moisture rots it, nor any time causes it to\ndecay.”  City of God, book xxi, ch. iv.",
        "Such aspects of things as these, their naturalness and\nunnaturalness the sympathies and antipathies of their superficial\nqualities, their eccentricities, their brightness and strength\nand destructiveness, were inevitably the ways in which they\noriginally fastened our attention.",
        "If you open early medical books, you will find sympathetic magic\ninvoked on every page.  Take, for example, the famous vulnerary\nointment attributed to Paracelsus.  For this there were a variety\nof receipts, including usually human fat, the fat of either a\nbull, a wild boar, or a bear, powdered earthworms, the usnia, or\nmossy growth on the weathered skull of a hanged criminal, and\nother materials equally unpleasant–the whole prepared under the\nplanet Venus if possible, but never under Mars or Saturn.  Then,\nif a splinter of wood, dipped in the patient’s blood, or the\nbloodstained weapon that wounded him, be immersed in this\nointment, the wound itself being tightly bound up, the latter\ninfallibly gets well–I quote now Van Helmont’s account–for the\nblood on the weapon or splinter, containing in it the spirit of\nthe wounded man, is roused to active excitement by the contact of\nthe ointment, whence there results to it a full commission or\npower to cure its cousin-german the blood in the patient’s body. \nThis it does by sucking out the dolorous and exotic impression\nfrom the wounded part.  But to do this it has to implore the aid\nof the bull’s fat, and other portions of the unguent.  The reason\nwhy bull’s fat is so powerful is that the bull at the time of\nslaughter is full of secret reluctancy and vindictive murmurs,\nand therefore dies with a higher flame of revenge about him than\nany other animal.  And thus we have made it out, says this\nauthor, that the admirable efficacy of the ointment ought to be\nimputed, not to any auxiliary concurrence of Satan, but simply to\nthe energy of the posthumous character of Revenge remaining\nfirmly impressed upon the blood and concreted fat in the unguent. \nJ. B. Van Helmont:  A Ternary of Paradoxes, translated by Walter\nCharleton, London, 1650.–I much abridge the original in my\ncitations.",
        "The author goes on to prove by the analogy of many other natural\nfacts that this sympathetic action between things at a distance\nis the true rationale of the case.  “If,” he says, “the heart of\na horse slain by a witch, taken out of the yet reeking carcase,\nbe impaled upon an arrow and roasted, immediately the whole witch\nbecomes tormented with the insufferable pains and cruelty of the\nfire, which could by no means happen unless there preceded a\nconjunction of the spirit of the witch with the spirit of the\nhorse.  In the reeking and yet panting heart, the spirit of the\nwitch is kept captive, and the retreat of it prevented by the\narrow transfixed.  Similarly hath not many a murdered carcase at\nthe coroner’s inquest suffered a fresh haemorrhage or cruentation\nat the presence of the assassin?–the blood being, as in a\nfurious fit of anger, enraged and agitated by the impress of\nrevenge conceived against the murderer, at the instant of the\nsoul’s compulsive exile from the body.  So, if you have dropsy,\ngout, or jaundice, by including some of your warm blood in the\nshell and white of an egg, which, exposed to a gentle heat, and\nmixed with a bait of flesh, you shall give to a hungry dog or\nhog, the disease shall instantly pass from you into the animal,\nand leave you entirely.  And similarly again, if you burn some of\nthe milk either of a cow or of a woman, the gland from which it\nissued will dry up.  A gentleman at Brussels had his nose mowed\noff in a combat, but the celebrated surgeon Tagliacozzus digged a\nnew nose for him out of the skin of the arm of a porter at\nBologna.  About thirteen months after his return to his own\ncountry, the engrafted nose grew cold, putrefied, and in a few\ndays dropped off, and it was then discovered that the porter had\nexpired, near about the same punctilio of time.  There are still\nat Brussels eye-witnesses of this occurrence,” says Van Helmont;\nand adds, “I pray what is there in this of superstition or of\nexalted imagination?”",
        "Modern mind-cure literature–the works of Prentice Mulford, for\nexample–is full of sympathetic magic. ",
        "How indeed could it be otherwise?  The extraordinary value, for\nexplanation and prevision, of those mathematical and mechanical\nmodes of conception which science uses, was a result that could\nnot possibly have been expected in advance.  Weight, movement,\nvelocity, direction, position, what thin, pallid, uninteresting\nideas!  How could the richer animistic aspects of Nature, the\npeculiarities and oddities that make phenomena picturesquely\nstriking or expressive, fail to have been first singled out and\nfollowed by philosophy as the more promising avenue to the\nknowledge of Nature’s life?  Well, it is still in these richer\nanimistic and dramatic aspects that religion delights to dwell. \nIt is the terror and beauty of phenomena, the “promise” of the\ndawn and of the rainbow, the “voice” of the thunder, the\n\"gentleness” of the summer rain, the “sublimity” of the stars,\nand not the physical laws which these things follow, by which the\nreligious mind still continues to be most impressed; and just as\nof yore, the devout man tells you that in the solitude of his\nroom or of the fields he still feels the divine presence, that\ninflowings of help come in reply to his prayers, and that\nsacrifices to this unseen reality fill him with security and\npeace.",
        "Pure anachronism! says the survival-theory;–anachronism for\nwhich deanthropomorphization of the imagination is the remedy\nrequired.  The less we mix the private with the cosmic, the more\nwe dwell in universal and impersonal terms, the truer heirs of\nScience we become.",
        "In spite of the appeal which this impersonality of the scientific\nattitude makes to a certain magnanimity of temper, I believe it\nto be shallow, and I can now state my reason in comparatively few\nwords.  That reason is that, so long as we deal with the cosmic\nand the general, we deal only with the symbols of reality, but as\nsoon as we deal with private and personal phenomena as such, we\ndeal with realities in the completest sense of the term.  I think\nI can easily make clear what I mean by these words.",
        "The world of our experience consists at all times of two parts,\nan objective and a subjective part, of which the former may be\nincalculably more extensive than the latter, and yet the latter\ncan never be omitted or suppressed.  The objective part is the\nsum total of whatsoever at any given time we may be thinking of,\nthe subjective part is the inner “state” in which the thinking\ncomes to pass.  What we think of may be enormous–the cosmic\ntimes and spaces, for example– whereas the inner state may be\nthe most fugitive and paltry activity of mind.  Yet the cosmic\nobjects, so far as the experience yields them, are but ideal\npictures of something whose existence we do not inwardly possess\nbut only point at outwardly, while the inner state is our very\nexperience itself; its reality and that of our experience are\none.  A conscious field PLUS its object as felt or thought of\nPLUS an attitude towards the object PLUS the sense of a self to\nwhom the attitude belongs–such a concrete bit of personal\nexperience may be a small bit, but it is a solid bit as long as\nit lasts; not hollow, not a mere abstract element of experience,\nsuch as the “object” is when taken all alone.  It is a FULL fact,\neven though it be an insignificant fact; it is of the KIND to\nwhich all realities whatsoever must belong; the motor currents of\nthe world run through the like of it; it is on the line\nconnecting real events with real events.  That unsharable feeling\nwhich each one of us has of the pinch of his individual destiny\nas he privately feels it rolling out on fortune’s wheel may be\ndisparaged for its egotism, may be sneered at as unscientific,\nbut it is the one thing that fills up the measure of our concrete\nactuality, and any would-be existent that should lack such a\nfeeling, or its analogue, would be a piece of reality only half\nmade up.[336]",
        "[336] Compare Lotze’s doctrine that the only meaning we can\nattach to the notion of a thing as it is “in itself” is by\nconceiving it as it is FOR itself, i.e., as a piece of full\nexperience with a private sense of “pinch” or inner activity of\nsome sort going with it.",
        "If this be true, it is absurd for science to say that the\negotistic elements of experience should be suppressed.  The axis\nof reality runs solely through the egotistic places–they are\nstrung upon it like so many beads.  To describe the world with\nall the various feelings of the individual pinch of destiny, all\nthe various spiritual attitudes, left out from the\ndescription–they being as describable as anything else –would\nbe something like offering a printed bill of fare as the\nequivalent for a solid meal.  Religion makes no such blunder. \nThe individual’s religion may be egotistic, and those private\nrealities which it keeps in touch with may be narrow enough; but\nat any rate it always remains infinitely less hollow and\nabstract, as far as it goes, than a science which prides itself\non taking no account of anything private at all.",
        "A bill of fare with one real raisin on it instead of the word\n\"raisin,” with one real egg instead of the word “egg,” might be\nan inadequate meal, but it would at least be a commencement of\nreality.  The contention of the survival-theory that we ought to\nstick to non-personal elements exclusively seems like saying that\nwe ought to be satisfied forever with reading the naked bill of\nfare.  I think, therefore, that however particular questions\nconnected with our individual destinies may be answered, it is\nonly by acknowledging them as genuine questions, and living in\nthe sphere of thought which they open up, that we become\nprofound.  But to live thus is to be religious; so I\nunhesitatingly repudiate the survival-theory of religion, as\nbeing founded on an egregious mistake.  It does not follow,\nbecause our ancestors made so many errors of fact and mixed them\nwith their religion, that we should therefore leave off being\nreligious at all.[337]  By being religious we establish ourselves\nin possession of ultimate reality at the only points at which\nreality is given us to guard.  Our responsible concern is with\nour private destiny, after all.",
        "[337] Even the errors of fact may possibly turn out not to be as\nwholesale as the scientist assumes.  We saw in Lecture IV how the\nreligious conception of the universe seems to many mind-curers\n\"verified” from day to day by their experience of fact. \n\"Experience of fact” is a field with so many things in it that\nthe sectarian scientist methodically declining, as he does, to\nrecognize such “facts” as mind-curers and others like them\nexperience, otherwise than by such rude heads of classification\nas “bosh,” “rot,” “folly,” certainly leaves out a mass of raw\nfact which, save for the industrious interest of the religious in\nthe more personal aspects of reality, would never have succeeded\nin getting itself recorded at all.  We know this to be true\nalready in certain cases; it may, therefore, be true in others as\nwell.  Miraculous healings have always been part of the\nsupernaturalist stock in trade, and have always been dismissed by\nthe scientist as figments of the imagination.  But the\nscientist’s tardy education in the facts of hypnotism has\nrecently given him an apperceiving mass for phenomena of this\norder, and he consequently now allows that the healings may\nexist, provided you expressly call them effects of “suggestion.” \nEven the stigmata of the cross on Saint Francis’s hands and feet\nmay on these terms not be a fable.  Similarly, the time-honored\nphenomenon of diabolical possession is on the point of being\nadmitted by the scientist as a fact, now that he has the name of\n\"hystero-demonopathy” by which to apperceive it.  No one can\nforesee just how far this legitimation of occultist phenomena\nunder newly found scientist titles may proceed–even “prophecy,\"\neven “levitation,” might creep into the pale.",
        "Thus the divorce between scientist facts and religious facts may\nnot necessarily be as eternal as it at first sight seems, nor the\npersonalism and romanticism of the world, as they appeared to\nprimitive thinking, be matters so irrevocably outgrown.  The\nfinal human opinion may, in short, in some manner now impossible\nto foresee, revert to the more personal style, just as any path\nof progress may follow a spiral rather than a straight line.  If\nthis were so, the rigorously impersonal view of science might one\nday appear as having been a temporarily useful eccentricity\nrather than the definitively triumphant position which the\nsectarian scientist at present so confidently announces it to be.",
        "You see now why I have been so individualistic throughout these\nlectures, and why I have seemed so bent on rehabilitating the\nelement of feeling in religion and subordinating its intellectual\npart.  Individuality is founded in feeling; and the recesses of\nfeeling, the darker, blinder strata of character, are the only\nplaces in the world in which we catch real fact in the making,\nand directly perceive how events happen, and how work is actually\ndone.[338]  Compared with this world of living individualized\nfeelings, the world of generalized objects which the intellect\ncontemplates is without solidity or life.  As in stereoscopic or\nkinetoscopic pictures seen outside the instrument, the third\ndimension, the movement, the vital element, are not there.  We\nget a beautiful picture of an express train supposed to be\nmoving, but where in the picture, as I have heard a friend say,\nis the energy or the fifty miles an hour?[339]",
        "[338] Hume’s criticism has banished causation from the world of\nphysical objects, and “Science” is absolutely satisfied to define\ncause in terms of concomitant change-read Mach, Pearson, Ostwald.\nThe “original” of the notion of causation is in our inner\npersonal experience, and only there can causes in the\nold-fashioned sense be directly observed and described.",
        "[339] When I read in a religious paper words like these: \n\"Perhaps the best thing we can say of God is that he is THE\nINEVITABLE INFERENCE,” I recognize the tendency to let religion\nevaporate in intellectual terms.  Would martyrs have sung in the\nflames for a mere inference, however inevitable it might be? \nOriginal religious men, like Saint Francis, Luther, Behmen, have\nusually been enemies of the intellect’s pretension to meddle with\nreligious things.  Yet the intellect, everywhere invasive, shows\neverywhere its shallowing effect.  See how the ancient spirit of\nMethodism evaporates under those wonderfully able rationalistic\nbooklets (which every one should read) of a philosopher like\nProfessor Bowne (The Christian Revelation, The Christian Life The\nAtonement:  Cincinnati and New York, 1898, 1899, 1900).  See the\npositively expulsive purpose of philosophy properly so called:–",
        "“Religion,” writes M.  Vacherot (La Religion, Paris, 1869, pp.\n313, 436, et passim), “answers to a transient state or condition,\nnot to a permanent determination of human nature, being merely an\nexpression of that stage of the human mind which is dominated by\nthe imagination. . . . Christianity has but a single possible\nfinal heir to its estate, and that is scientific philosophy.”",
        "In a still more radical vein, Professor Ribot (Psychologie des\nSentiments, p. 310) describes the evaporation of religion.  He\nsums it up in a single formula–the ever-growing predominance of\nthe rational intellectual element, with the gradual fading out of\nthe emotional element, this latter tending to enter into the\ngroup of purely intellectual sentiments.  “Of religious sentiment\nproperly so called, nothing survives at last save a vague respect\nfor the unknowable x which is a last relic of the fear, and a\ncertain attraction towards the ideal, which is a relic of the\nlove, that characterized the earlier periods of religious growth.",
        "To state this more simply, religion tends to turn into religious\nphilosophy.–These are psychologically entirely different things,\nthe one being a theoretic construction of ratiocination, whereas\nthe other is the living work of a group of persons, or of a great\ninspired leader, calling into play the entire thinking and\nfeeling organism of man.”",
        "I find the same failure to recognize that the stronghold of\nreligion lies in individuality in attempts like those of\nProfessor Baldwin (Mental Development, Social and Ethical\nInterpretations, ch. x) and Mr. H. R. Marshall (Instinct and\nReason, chaps.  viii. to xii.) to make it a purely “conservative\nsocial force.”",
        "Let us agree, then, that Religion, occupying herself with\npersonal destinies and keeping thus in contact with the only\nabsolute realities which we know, must necessarily play an\neternal part in human history.  The next thing to decide is what\nshe reveals about those destinies, or whether indeed she reveals\nanything distinct enough to be considered a general message to\nmankind.  We have done as you see, with our preliminaries, and\nour final summing up can now begin.",
        "I am well aware that after all the palpitating documents which I\nhave quoted, and all the perspectives of emotion-inspiring\ninstitution and belief that my previous lectures have opened, the\ndry analysis to which I now advance may appear to many of you\nlike an anti-climax, a tapering-off and flattening out of the\nsubject, instead of a crescendo of interest and result.  I said\nawhile ago that the religious attitude of Protestants appears\npoverty-stricken to the Catholic imagination.  Still more\npoverty-stricken, I fear, may my final summing up of the subject\nappear at first to some of you.  On which account I pray you now\nto bear this point in mind, that in the present part of it I am\nexpressly trying to reduce religion to its lowest admissible\nterms, to that minimum, free from individualistic excrescences,\nwhich all religions contain as their nucleus, and on which it may\nbe hoped that all religious persons may agree.  That established,\nwe should have a result which might be small, but would at least\nbe solid; and on it and round it the ruddier additional beliefs\non which the different individuals make their venture might be\ngrafted, and flourish as richly as you please.  I shall add my\nown over-belief (which will be, I confess, of a somewhat pallid\nkind, as befits a critical philosopher), and you will, I hope,\nalso add your over-beliefs, and we shall soon be in the varied\nworld of concrete religious constructions once more.  For the\nmoment, let me dryly pursue the analytic part of the task.",
        "Both thought and feeling are determinants of conduct, and the\nsame conduct may be determined either by feeling or by thought. \nWhen we survey the whole field of religion, we find a great\nvariety in the thoughts that have prevailed there; but the\nfeelings on the one hand and the conduct on the other are almost\nalways the same, for Stoic, Christian, and Buddhist saints are\npractically indistinguishable in their lives.  The theories which\nReligion generates, being thus variable, are secondary; and if\nyou wish to grasp her essence, you must look to the feelings and\nthe conduct as being the more constant elements.  It is between\nthese two elements that the short circuit exists on which she\ncarries on her principal business, while the ideas and symbols\nand other institutions form loop-lines which may be perfections\nand improvements, and may even some day all be united into one\nharmonious system, but which are not to be regarded as organs\nwith an indispensable function, necessary at all times for\nreligious life to go on.  This seems to me the first conclusion\nwhich we are entitled to draw from the phenomena we have passed\nin review.",
        "The next step is to characterize the feelings.  To what\npsychological order do they belong?",
        "The resultant outcome of them is in any case what Kant calls a\n\"sthenic” affection, an excitement of the cheerful, expansive,\n\"dynamogenic” order which, like any tonic, freshens our vital\npowers.  In almost every lecture, but especially in the lectures\non Conversion and on Saintliness, we have seen how this emotion\novercomes temperamental melancholy and imparts endurance to the\nSubject, or a zest, or a meaning, or an enchantment and glory to\nthe common objects of life.[340]  The name of “faith-state,” by\nwhich Professor Leuba designates it, is a good one.[341]  It is a\nbiological as well as a psychological condition, and Tolstoy is\nabsolutely accurate in classing faith among the forces BY WHICH\nMEN LIVE.[342]  The total absence of it, anhedonia,[343] means\ncollapse.",

        "This primacy, in the faith-state, of vague expansive impulse over\ndirection is well expressed in Walt Whitman’s lines (Leaves of\nGrass, 1872, p. 190):–  ",
        "“O to confront night, storms, hunger,ridicule, accidents,\n     rebuffs, as the trees and animals do. . . .  \nDear Camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and    \n    still urge you, without the least idea what is our           \n    destination  \nOr whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell’d and\ndefeated.”",
        "This readiness for great things, and this sense that the world by\nits importance, wonderfulness, etc., is apt for their production,\nwould seem to be the undifferentiated germ of all the higher\nfaiths.  Trust in our own dreams of ambition, or in our country’s\nexpansive destinies, and faith in the providence of God, all have\ntheir source in that onrush of our sanguine impulses, and in that\nsense of the exceedingness of the possible over the real.",
        "When, however, a positive intellectual content is associated with\na faith-state, it gets invincibly stamped in upon belief,[346]\nand this explains the passionate loyalty of religious persons\neverywhere to the minutest details of their so widely differing\ncreeds.  Taking creeds and faith-state together, as forming\n\"religions,” and treating these as purely subjective phenomena,\nwithout regard to the question of their “truth,” we are obliged,\non account of their extraordinary influence upon action and\nendurance, to class them amongst the most important biological\nfunctions of mankind.  Their stimulant and anaesthetic effect is\nso great that Professor Leuba, in a recent article,[347] goes so\nfar as to say that so long as men can USE their God, they care\nvery little who he is, or even whether he is at all.  “The truth\nof the matter can be put,” says Leuba, “in this way:  GOD IS NOT\nKNOWN, HE IS NOT UNDERSTOOD; HE IS USED–sometimes as\nmeat-purveyor, sometimes as moral support, sometimes as friend,\nsometimes as an object of love.  If he proves himself useful, the\nreligious consciousness asks for no more than that.  Does God\nreally exist?  How does he exist?  What is he?  are so many\nirrelevant questions.  Not God, but life, more life, a larger,\nricher, more satisfying life, is, in the last analysis, the end\nof religion.  The love of life, at any and every level of\ndevelopment, is the religious impulse.\"[348]",

        "[348] Loc. cit., pp. 571, 572, abridged.  See, also, this\nwriter’s extraordinarily true criticism of the notion that\nreligion primarily seeks to solve the intellectual mystery of the\nworld.  Compare what W. Bender says (in his Wesen der Religion,\nBonn, 1888, pp. 85, 38):  “Not the question about God, and not\nthe inquiry into the origin and purpose of the world is religion,\nbut the question about Man.  All religious views of life are\nanthropocentric.”  “Religion is that activity of the human\nimpulse towards self-preservation by means of which Man seeks to\ncarry his essential vital purposes through against the adverse\npressure of the world by raising himself freely towards the\nworld’s ordering and governing powers when the limits of his own\nstrength are reached.”  The whole book is little more than a\ndevelopment of these words.",
        "At this purely subjective rating, therefore, Religion must be\nconsidered vindicated in a certain way from the attacks of her\ncritics.  It would seem that she cannot be a mere anachronism and\nsurvival, but must exert a permanent function, whether she be\nwith or without intellectual content, and whether, if she have\nany, it be true or false.",
        "We must next pass beyond the point of view of merely subjective\nutility, and make inquiry into the intellectual content itself.",
        "First, is there, under all the discrepancies of the creeds, a\ncommon nucleus to which they bear their testimony unanimously?",
        "And second, ought we to consider the testimony true?",
        "I will take up the first question first, and answer it\nimmediately in the affirmative.  The warring gods and formulas of\nthe various religions do indeed cancel each other, but there is a\ncertain uniform deliverance in which religions all appear to\nmeet.  It consists of two parts:–",
        "1.  An uneasiness; and",
        "2.  Its solution.",
        "1.  The uneasiness, reduced to its simplest terms, is a sense\nthat there is SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT US as we naturally stand.",
        "2.  The solution is a sense that WE ARE SAVED FROM THE WRONGNESS\nby making proper connection with the higher powers.",
        "In those more developed minds which alone we are studying, the\nwrongness takes a moral character, and the salvation takes a\nmystical tinge.  I think we shall keep well within the limits of\nwhat is common to all such minds if we formulate the essence of\ntheir religious experience in terms like these:–",
        "The individual, so far as he suffers from his wrongness and\ncriticises it, is to that extent consciously beyond it, and in at\nleast possible touch with something higher, if anything higher\nexist.  Along with the wrong part there is thus a better part of\nhim, even though it may be but a most helpless germ.  With which\npart he should identify his real being is by no means obvious at\nthis stage; but when stage 2 (the stage of solution or salvation)\narrives,[349] the man identifies his real being with the germinal\nhigher part of himself; and does so in the following way.  He\nbecomes conscious that this higher part is conterminous and\ncontinuous with a MORE of the same quality, which is operative in\nthe universe outside of him, and which he can keep in working\ntouch with, and in a fashion get on board of and save himself\nwhen all his lower being has gone to pieces in the wreck.",
        "[349] Remember that for some men it arrives suddenly, for others\ngradually, whilst others again practically enjoy it all their\nlife.",
        "It seems to me that all the phenomena are accurately describable\nin these very simple general terms.[350]  They allow for the\ndivided self and the struggle; they involve the change of\npersonal centre and the surrender of the lower self; they express\nthe appearance of exteriority of the helping power and yet\naccount for our sense of union with it;[351] and they fully\njustify our feelings of security and joy.  There is probably no\nautobiographic document, among all those which I have quoted, to\nwhich the description will not well apply.  One need only add\nsuch specific details as will adapt it to various theologies and\nvarious personal temperaments, and one will then have the various\nexperiences reconstructed in their individual forms.",
        "[350] The practical difficulties are:  1, to “realize the\nreality” of one’s higher part; 2, to identify one’s self with it\nexclusively; and 3, to identify it with all the rest of ideal\nbeing.",
        "[351] “When mystical activity is at its height, we find\nconsciousness possessed by the sense of a being at once EXCESSIVE\nand IDENTICAL with the self:  great enough to be God; interior\nenough to be ME.  The “objectivity” of it ought in that case to\nbe called EXCESSIVITY, rather, or exceedingness.” ReCeJac:  Essai\nsur les fondements de la conscience mystique, 1897, p. 46.",
        "So far, however, as this analysis goes, the experiences are only\npsychological phenomena.  They possess, it is true, enormous\nbiological worth.  Spiritual strength really increases in the\nsubject when he has them, a new life opens for him, and they seem\nto him a place of conflux where the forces of two universes meet;\nand yet this may be nothing but his subjective way of feeling\nthings, a mood of his own fancy, in spite of the effects\nproduced.  I now turn to my second question:  What is the\nobjective “truth” of their content?[352]",
        "[352] The word “truth” is here taken to mean something additional\nto bare value for life, although the natural propensity of man is\nto believe that whatever has great value for life is thereby\ncertified as true.",
        "The part of the content concerning which the question of truth\nmost pertinently arises is that “MORE of the same quality” with\nwhich our own higher self appears in the experience to come into\nharmonious working relation.  Is such a “more” merely our own\nnotion, or does it really exist?  If so, in what shape does it\nexist?  Does it act, as well as exist?   And in what form should\nwe conceive of that “union” with it of which religious geniuses\nare so convinced?",
        "It is in answering these questions that the various theologies\nperform their theoretic work, and that their divergencies most\ncome to light.  They all agree that the “more” really exists;\nthough some of them hold it to exist in the shape of a personal\ngod or gods, while others are satisfied to conceive it as a\nstream of ideal tendency embedded in the eternal structure of the\nworld.  They all agree, moreover, that it acts as well as exists,\nand that something really is effected for the better when you\nthrow your life into its hands.  It is when they treat of the\nexperience of “union” with it that their speculative differences\nappear most clearly.  Over this point pantheism and theism,\nnature and second birth, works and grace and karma, immortality\nand reincarnation, rationalism and mysticism, carry on inveterate\ndisputes.",
        "At the end of my lecture on Philosophy[353] I held out the notion\nthat an impartial science of religions might sift out from the\nmidst of their discrepancies a common body of doctrine which she\nmight also formulate in terms to which <501> physical science\nneed not object.  This, I said, she might adopt as her own\nreconciling hypothesis, and recommend it for general belief.  I\nalso said that in my last lecture I should have to try my own\nhand at framing such an hypothesis.",
        "[353] Above, p. 445.",
        "The time has now come for this attempt.  Who says “hypothesis\"\nrenounces the ambition to be coercive in his arguments. The most\nI can do is, accordingly, to offer something that may fit the\nfacts so easily that your scientific logic will find no plausible\npretext for vetoing your impulse to welcome it as true.",
        "The “more,” as we called it, and the meaning of our “union” with\nit, form the nucleus of our inquiry.  Into what definite\ndescription can these words be translated, and for what definite\nfacts do they stand?  It would never do for us to place ourselves\noffhand at the position of a particular theology, the Christian\ntheology, for example, and proceed immediately to define the\n\"more” as Jehovah, and the “union” as his imputation to us of the\nrighteousness of Christ.  That would be unfair to other\nreligions, and, from our present standpoint at least, would be an\nover-belief.",
        "We must begin by using less particularized terms; and, since one\nof the duties of the science of religions is to keep religion in\nconnection with the rest of science, we shall do well to seek\nfirst of all a way of describing the “more,” which psychologists\nmay also recognize as real.  The subconscious self is nowadays a\nwell-accredited psychological entity; and I believe that in it we\nhave exactly the mediating term required.  Apart from all\nreligious considerations, there is actually and literally more\nlife in our total soul than we are at any time aware of.  The\nexploration of the transmarginal field has hardly yet been\nseriously undertaken, but what Mr. Myers said in 1892 in his\nessay on the Subliminal Consciousness[354] is as true as when it\nwas first written:  “Each of us is in reality an abiding\npsychical entity far more extensive than he knows–an\nindividuality which can never express itself completely through\nany corporeal manifestation.  The Self manifests through the\norganism; but there is always some part of the Self unmanifested;\nand always, as it seems, some power of organic expression in\nabeyance or reserve.\"[355]  Much of the content of this larger\nbackground against which our conscious being stands out in relief\nis insignificant.  Imperfect memories, silly jingles, inhibitive\ntimidities, “dissolutive” phenomena of various sorts, as Myers\ncalls them, enters into it for a large part.  But in it many of\nthe performances of genius seem also to have their origin; and in\nour study of conversion, of mystical experiences, and of prayer,\nwe have seen how striking a part invasions from this region play\nin the religious life.",
        "[354] Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, vol.\nvii. p. 305. For a full statement of Mr. Myers’s views, I may\nrefer to his posthumous work, “Human Personality in the Light of\nRecent Research,” which is already announced by Messrs. \nLongmans, Green & Co. as being in press.  Mr. Myers for the\nfirst time proposed as a general psychological problem the\nexploration of the subliminal region of consciousness throughout\nits whole extent, and made the first methodical steps in its\ntopography by treating as a natural series a mass of subliminal\nfacts hitherto considered only as curious isolated facts and\nsubjecting them to a systematized nomenclature.  How important\nthis exploration will prove, future work upon the path which\nMyers has opened can alone show.  compare my paper:  “Frederic\nMyers’s services to Psychology,” in the said Proceedings, part\nxlii., May, 1901.",
        "[355] Compare the inventory given above on pp. 472-4, and also\nwhat is said of the subconscious self on pp. 228-231, 235-236.",
        "Let me then propose, as an hypothesis, that whatever it may be on\nits FARTHER side, the “more” with which in religious experience\nwe feel ourselves connected is on its HITHER side the\nsubconscious continuation of our conscious life. Starting thus\nwith a recognized psychological fact as our basis, we seem to\npreserve a contact with “science” which the ordinary theologian\nlacks.  At the same time the theologian’s contention that the\nreligious man is moved by an external power is vindicated, for it\nis one of the peculiarities of invasions from the subconscious\nregion to take on objective appearances, and to suggest to the\nSubject an external control.  In the religious life the control\nis felt as “higher\"; but since on our hypothesis it is primarily\nthe higher faculties of our own hidden mind which are\ncontrolling, the sense of union with the power beyond us is a\nsense of something, not merely apparently, but literally true.",
        "This doorway into the subject seems to me the best one for a\nscience of religions, for it mediates between a number of\ndifferent points of view.  Yet it is only a doorway, and\ndifficulties present themselves as soon as we step through it,\nand ask how far our transmarginal consciousness carries us if we\nfollow it on its remoter side.  Here the over-beliefs begin: \nhere mysticism and the conversion-rapture and Vedantism and\ntranscendental idealism bring in their monistic\ninterpretations[356] and tell us that the finite self rejoins the\nabsolute self, for it was always one with God and identical with\nthe soul of the world.[357]  Here the prophets of all the\ndifferent religions come with their visions, voices, raptures,\nand other openings, supposed by each to authenticate his own\npeculiar faith.",
        "[356] Compare above, pp. 410 ff.",
        "[357] One more expression of this belief, to increase the\nreader’s familiarity with the notion of it:–",
        "“If this room is full of darkness for thousands of years, and you\ncome in and begin to weep and wail, ’Oh, the darkness,’ will the\ndarkness vanish?  Bring the light in, strike a match, and light\ncomes in a moment.  So what good will it do you to think all your\nlives, ’Oh, I have done evil, I have made many mistakes’?  It\nrequires no ghost to tell us that.  Bring in the light, and the\nevil goes in a moment.  Strengthen the real nature, build up\nyourselves, the effulgent, the resplendent, the ever pure, call\nthat up in every one whom you see.  I wish that every one of us\nhad come to such a state that even when we see the vilest of\nhuman beings we can see the God within, and instead of\ncondemning, say, ’Rise, thou effulgent One, rise thou who art\nalways pure, rise thou birthless and deathless, rise almighty,\nand manifest your nature.’ . . . This is the highest prayer that\nthe Advaita teaches.  This is the one prayer:  remembering our\nnature.”. . . “Why does man go out to look for a God? . . . It is\nyour own heart beating, and you did not know, you were mistaking\nit for something external.  He, nearest of the near, my own self,\nthe reality of my own life, my body and my soul.–I am Thee and\nThou art Me.  That is your own nature.  Assert it, manifest it. \nNot to become pure, you are pure already.  You are not to be\nperfect, you are that already.  Every good thought which you\nthink or act upon is simply tearing the veil, as it were, and the\npurity, the Infinity, the God behind, manifests itself–the\neternal Subject of everything, the eternal Witness in this\nuniverse, your own Self.  Knowledge is, as it were, a lower step,\na degradation.  We are It already; how to know It?”  Swami\nViverananda: Addresses, No. XII., Practical Vedanta, part iv. pp.\n172, 174, London, 1897; and Lectures, The Real and the Apparent\nMan, p. 24, abridged.",
        "Those of us who are not personally favored with such specific\nrevelations must stand outside of them altogether and, for the\npresent at least, decide that, since they corroborate\nincompatible theological doctrines, they neutralize one another\nand leave no fixed results.  If we follow any one of them, or if\nwe follow philosophical theory and embrace monistic pantheism on\nnon-mystical grounds, we do so in the exercise of our individual\nfreedom, and build out our religion in the way most congruous\nwith our personal susceptibilities.  Among these susceptibilities\nintellectual ones play a decisive part.  Although the religious\nquestion is primarily a question of life, of living or not living\nin the higher union which opens itself to us as a gift, yet the\nspiritual excitement in which the gift appears a real one will\noften fail to be aroused in an individual until certain\nparticular intellectual beliefs or ideas which, as we say, come\nhome to him, are touched.[358] These ideas will thus be essential\nto that individual’s religion;–which is as much as to say that\nover-beliefs in various directions are absolutely indispensable,\nand that we should treat them with tenderness and tolerance so\nlong as they are not intolerant themselves. As I have elsewhere\nwritten, the most interesting and valuable things about a man are\nusually his over-beliefs.",
        "[358] For instance, here is a case where a person exposed from\nher birth to Christian ideas had to wait till they came to her\nclad in spiritistic formulas before the saving experience set\nin:–",
        "“For myself I can say that spiritualism has saved me.  It was\nrevealed to me at a critical moment of my life, and without it I\ndon’t know what I should have done.  It has taught me to detach\nmyself from worldly things and to place my hope in things to\ncome.  Through it I have learned to see in all men, even in those\nmost criminal, even in those from whom I have most suffered,\nundeveloped brothers to whom I owed assistance, love, and\nforgiveness.  I have learned that I must lose my temper over\nnothing despise no one, and pray for all.  Most of all I have\nlearned to pray!  And although I have still much to learn in this\ndomain, prayer ever brings me more strength, consolation, and\ncomfort.  I feel more than ever that I have only made a few steps\non the long road of progress; but I look at its length without\ndismay, for I have confidence that the day will come when all my\nefforts shall be rewarded.  So Spiritualism has a great place in\nmy life, indeed it holds the first place there.”  Flournoy\nCollection.",
        "Disregarding the over beliefs, and confining ourselves to what is\ncommon and generic, we have in the fact that the conscious person\nis continuous with a wider self through which saving experiences\ncome,[359] a positive content of religious experience which, it\nseems to me, is literally and objectively true as far as it goes.",
        "If I now proceed to state my own hypothesis about the farther\nlimits of this extension of our personality, I shall be offering\nmy own over-belief– though I know it will appear a sorry\nunder-belief to some of you–for which I can only bespeak the\nsame indulgence which in a converse case I should accord to\nyours.",

Yet the unseen region in question is not merely ideal,\nfor it produces effects in this world.  When we commune with it,\nwork is actually done upon our finite personality, for we are\nturned into new men, and consequences in the way of conduct\nfollow in the natural world upon our regenerative change.[360]\nBut that which produces effects within another reality must be\ntermed a reality itself, so I feel as if we had no philosophic\nexcuse for calling the unseen or mystical world unreal.",
        "[360] That the transaction of opening ourselves, otherwise called\nprayer, is a perfectly definite one for certain persons, appears\nabundantly in the preceding lectures.  I append another concrete\nexample to rein force the impression on the reader’s mind:–",
        "“Man can learn to transcend these limitations [of finite thought]\nand draw power and wisdom at will. . . . The divine presence is\nknown through experience.  The turning to a higher plane is a\ndistinct act of consciousness.  It is not a vague, twilight or\nsemi-conscious experience.  It is not an ecstasy, it is not a\ntrance.  It is not super-consciousness in the Vedantic sense.  It\nis not due to self-hypnotization.  It is a perfectly calm, sane,\nsound, rational, common-sense shifting of consciousness from the\nphenomena of sense-perception to the phenomena of seership, from\nthe thought of self to a distinctively higher realm. . . . For\nexample, if the lower self be nervous, anxious, tense, one can in\na few moments compel it to be calm.  This is not done by a word\nsimply.  Again I say, it is not hypnotism.  It is by the exercise\nof power.  One feels the spirit of peace as definitely as heat is\nperceived on a hot summer day.  The power can be as surely used\nas the sun s rays can be focused and made to do work, to set fire\nto wood.”  The Higher Law, vol. iv. pp. 4, 6, Boston, August,\n1901.",
        "God is the natural appellation, for us Christians at least, for\nthe supreme reality, so I will call this higher part of the\nuniverse by the name of God.[361]  We and God have business with\neach other; and in opening ourselves to his influence our deepest\ndestiny is fulfilled.  The universe, at those parts of it which\nour personal being constitutes, takes a turn genuinely for the\nworse or for the better in proportion as each one of us fulfills\nor evades God’s demands.  As far as this goes I probably have you\nwith me, for I only translate into schematic language what I may\ncall the instinctive belief of mankind:  God is real since he\nproduces real effects.",
        "[361] Transcendentalists are fond of the term “Over-soul,” but as\na rule they use it in an intellectualist sense, as meaning only a\nmedium of communion.  “God” is a causal agent as well as a medium\nof communion, and that is the aspect which I wish to emphasize.",
        "The real effects in question, so far as I have as yet admitted\nthem, are exerted on the personal centres of energy of the\nvarious subjects, but the spontaneous faith of most of the\nsubjects is that they embrace a wider sphere than this.  Most\nreligious men believe (or “know,” if they be mystical) that not\nonly they themselves, but the whole universe of beings to whom\nthe God is present, are secure in his parental hands.  There is a\nsense, a dimension, they are sure, in which we are ALL saved, in\nspite of the gates of hell and all adverse terrestrial\nappearances.  God’s existence is the guarantee of an ideal order\nthat shall be permanently preserved.  This world may indeed, as\nscience assures us, some day burn up or freeze; but if it is part\nof his order, the old ideals are sure to be brought elsewhere to\nfruition, so that where God is, tragedy is only provisional and\npartial, and shipwreck and dissolution are not the absolutely\nfinal things.  Only when this farther step of faith concerning\nGod is taken, and remote objective consequences are predicted,\ndoes religion, as it seems to me, get wholly free from the first\nimmediate subjective experience, and bring a REAL HYPOTHESIS into\nplay.  A good hypothesis in science must have other properties\nthan those of the phenomenon it is immediately invoked to\nexplain, otherwise it is not prolific enough.  God, meaning only\nwhat enters into the religious man’s experience of union, falls\nshort of being an hypothesis of this more useful order.  He needs\nto enter into wider cosmic relations in order to justify the\nsubject’s absolute confidence and peace.",
        "That the God with whom, starting from the hither side of our own\nextra-marginal self, we come at its remoter margin into commerce\nshould be the absolute world-ruler, is of course a very\nconsiderable over-belief.  Over-belief as it is, though, it is an\narticle of almost every one’s religion.  Most of us pretend in\nsome way to prop it upon our philosophy, but the philosophy\nitself is really propped upon this faith. What is this but to say\nthat Religion, in her fullest exercise of function, is not a mere\nillumination of facts already elsewhere given, not a mere\npassion, like love, which views things in a rosier light.  It is\nindeed that, as we have seen abundantly.  But it is something\nmore, namely, a postulator of new FACTS as well.  The world\ninterpreted religiously is not the materialistic world over\nagain, with an altered expression; it must have, over and above\nthe altered expression, a natural constitution different at some\npoint from that which a materialistic world would have.  It must\nbe such that different events can be expected in it, different\nconduct must be required.",
        "This thoroughly “pragmatic” view of religion has usually been\ntaken as a matter of course by common men.  They have\ninterpolated divine miracles into the field of nature, they have\nbuilt a heaven out beyond the grave.  It is only\ntranscendentalist metaphysicians who think that, without adding\nany concrete details to Nature, or subtracting any, but by\nsimply calling it the expression of absolute spirit, you make it\nmore divine just as it stands.  I believe the pragmatic way of\ntaking religion to be the deeper way.  It gives it body as well\nas soul, it makes it claim, as everything real must claim, some\ncharacteristic realm of fact as its very own. What the more\ncharacteristically divine facts are, apart from the actual inflow\nof energy in the faith-state and the prayer-state, I know not. \nBut the over-belief on which I am ready to make my personal\nventure is that they exist.  The whole drift of my education goes\nto persuade me that the world of our present consciousness is\nonly one out of many worlds of consciousness that exist, and that\nthose other worlds must contain experiences which have a meaning\nfor our life also; and that although in the main their\nexperiences and those of this world keep discrete, yet the two\nbecome continuous at certain points, and higher energies filter\nin.  By being faithful in my poor measure to this over-belief, I\nseem to myself to keep more sane and true.  I CAN, of course, put\nmyself into the sectarian scientist’s attitude, and imagine\nvividly that the world of sensations and of scientific laws and\nobjects may be all.  But whenever I do this, I hear that inward\nmonitor of which W. K. Clifford once wrote, whispering the word\n\"bosh!”  Humbug is humbug, even though it bear the scientific\nname, and the total expression of human experience, as I view it\nobjectively, invincibly urges me beyond the narrow “scientific\"\nbounds.  Assuredly, the real world is of a different\ntemperament–more intricately built than physical science allows.",
        "So my objective and my subjective conscience both hold me to the\nover-belief which I express.  Who knows whether the faithfulness\nof individuals here below to their own poor over-beliefs may not\nactually help God in turn to be more effectively faithful to his\nown greater tasks?",
        "In writing my concluding lecture I had to aim so much at\nsimplification that I fear that my general philosophic position\nreceived so scant a statement as hardly to be intelligible to\nsome of my readers.  I therefore add this epilogue, which must\nalso be so brief as possibly to remedy but little the defect.  In\na later work I may be enabled to state my position more amply and\nconsequently more clearly.",
        "Originality cannot be expected in a field like this, where all\nthe attitudes and tempers that are possible have been exhibited\nin literature long ago, and where any new writer can immediately\nbe classed under a familiar head.  If one should make a division\nof all thinkers into naturalists and supernaturalists, I should\nundoubtedly have to go, along with most philosophers, into the\nsupernaturalist branch.  But there is a crasser and a more\nrefined supernaturalism, and it is to the refined division that\nmost philosophers at the present day belong.  If not regular\ntranscendental idealists, they at least obey the Kantian\ndirection enough to bar out ideal entities from interfering\ncausally in the course of phenomenal events.  Refined\nsupernaturalism is universalistic supernaturalism; for the\n\"crasser” variety “piecemeal” supernaturalism would perhaps be\nthe better name.  It went with that older theology which to-day\nis supposed to reign only among uneducated people, or to be found\namong the few belated professors of the dualisms which Kant is\nthought to have displaced.  It admits miracles and providential\nleadings, and finds no intellectual difficulty in mixing the\nideal and the real worlds together by interpolating influences\nfrom the ideal region among the forces that causally determine\nthe real world’s details.  In this the refined supernaturalists\nthink that it muddles disparate dimensions of existence.  For\nthem the world of the ideal has no efficient causality, and never\nbursts into the world of phenomena at particular points.  The\nideal world, for them, is not a world of facts, but only of the\nmeaning of facts; it is a point of view for judging facts.  It\nappertains to a different “-ology,” and inhabits a different\ndimension of being altogether from that in which existential\npropositions obtain.  It cannot get down upon the flat level of\nexperience and interpolate itself piecemeal between distinct\nportions of nature, as those who believe, for example, in divine\naid coming in response to prayer, are bound to think it must.",
        "Notwithstanding my own inability to accept either popular\nChristianity or scholastic theism, I suppose that my belief that\nin communion with the Ideal new force comes into the world, and\nnew departures are made here below, subjects me to being classed\namong the supernaturalists of the piecemeal or crasser type. \nUniversalistic supernaturalism surrenders, it seems to me, too\neasily to naturalism.  It takes the facts of physical science at\ntheir face-value, and leaves the laws of life just as naturalism\nfinds them, with no hope of remedy, in case their fruits are bad.",
        "It confines itself to sentiments about life as a whole,\nsentiments which may be admiring and adoring, but which need not\nbe so, as the existence of systematic pessimism proves.  In this\nuniversalistic way of taking the ideal world, the essence of\npractical religion seems to me to evaporate.  Both instinctively\nand for logical reasons, I find it hard to believe that\nprinciples can exist which make no difference in facts.[362]  But\nall facts are particular facts, and the whole interest of the\nquestion of God’s existence seems to me to lie in the\nconsequences for particulars which that existence may be expected\nto entail. That no concrete particular of experience should alter\nits complexion in consequence of a God being there seems to me an\nincredible proposition, and yet it is the thesis to which\n(implicitly at any rate) refined supernaturalism seems to cling. \nIt is only with experience en bloc, it says, that the Absolute\nmaintains relations.  It condescends to no transactions of\ndetail.",
        "[362] Transcendental idealism, of course, insists that its ideal\nworld makes THIS difference, that facts EXIST.  We owe it to the\nAbsolute that we have a world of fact at all.  “A world” of\nfact!–that exactly is the trouble.  An entire world is the\nsmallest unit with which the Absolute can work, whereas to our\nfinite minds work for the better ought to be done within this\nworld, setting in at single points.  Our difficulties and our\nideals are all piecemeal affairs, but the Absolute can do no\npiecework for us; so that all the interests which our poor souls\ncompass raise their heads too late.  We should have spoken\nearlier, prayed for another world absolutely, before this world\nwas born.  It is strange, I have heard a friend say, to see this\nblind corner into which Christian thought has worked itself at\nlast, with its God who can raise no particular weight whatever,\nwho can help us with no private burden, and who is on the side of\nour enemies as much as he is on our own.  Odd evolution from the\nGod of David’s psalms!",
        "I am ignorant of Buddhism and speak under correction, and merely\nin order the better to describe my general point of view; but as\nI apprehend the Buddhistic doctrine of Karma, I agree in\nprinciple with that.  All supernaturalists admit that facts are\nunder the judgment of higher law; but for Buddhism as I interpret\nit, and for religion generally so far as it remains unweakened by\ntranscendentalistic metaphysics, the word “judgment” here means\nno such bare academic verdict or platonic appreciation as it\nmeans in Vedantic or modern absolutist systems; it carries, on\nthe contrary, EXECUTION with it, is in rebus as well as post rem.\nand operates “causally” as partial factor in the total fact. The\nuniverse becomes a gnosticism[363] pure and simple on any other\nterms.  But this view that judgment and execution go together is\nthat of the crasser supernaturalist way of thinking, so the\npresent volume must on the whole be classed with the other\nexpressions of that creed.",
        "[363] See my Will to Believe and other Essays in popular\nPhilosophy. 1897, p. 165.",
        "I state the matter thus bluntly, because the current of thought\nin academic circles runs against me, and I feel like a man who\nmust set his back against an open door quickly if he does not\nwish to see it closed and locked.  In spite of its being so\nshocking to the reigning intellectual tastes, I believe that a\ncandid consideration of piecemeal supernaturalism and a complete\ndiscussion of all its metaphysical bearings will show it to be\nthe hypothesis by which the largest number of legitimate\nrequirements are met.  That of course would be a program for\nother books than this; what I now say sufficiently indicates to\nthe philosophic reader the place where I belong.",
        "If asked just where the differences in fact which are due to\nGod’s existence come in, I should have to say that in general I\nhave no hypothesis to offer beyond what the phenomenon of\n\"prayerful communion,” especially when certain kinds of incursion\nfrom the subconscious region take part in it, immediately\nsuggests.  The appearance is that in this phenomenon something\nideal, which in one sense is part of ourselves and in another\nsense is not ourselves, actually exerts an influence, raises our\ncentre of personal energy, and produces regenerative effects\nunattainable in other ways.  If, then, there be a wider world of\nbeing than that of our every-day consciousness, if in it there be\nforces whose effects on us are intermittent, if one facilitating\ncondition of the effects be the openness of the “subliminal\"\ndoor, we have the elements of a theory to which the phenomena of\nreligious life lend plausibility.  I am so impressed by the\nimportance of these phenomena that I adopt the hypothesis which\nthey so naturally suggest.  At these places at least, I say, it\nwould seem as though transmundane energies, God, if you will,\nproduced immediate effects within the natural world to which the\nrest of our experience belongs.",
        "The difference in natural “fact” which most of us would assign as\nthe first difference which the existence of a God ought to make\nwould, I imagine, be personal immortality. Religion, in fact, for\nthe great majority of our own race MEANS immortality, and nothing\nelse.  God is the producer of immortality; and whoever has doubts\nof immortality is written down as an atheist without farther\ntrial.  I have said nothing in my lectures about immortality or\nthe belief therein, for to me it seems a secondary point.  If our\nideals are only cared for in “eternity,” I do not see why we\nmight not be willing to resign their care to other hands than\nours.  Yet I sympathize with the urgent impulse to be present\nourselves, and in the conflict of impulses, both of them so vague\nyet both of them noble, I know not how to decide.  It seems to me\nthat it is eminently a case for facts to testify.  Facts, I\nthink, are yet lacking to prove “spirit-return,” though I have\nthe highest respect for the patient labors of Messrs. Myers,\nHodgson, and Hyslop, and am somewhat impressed by their favorable\nconclusions.  I consequently leave the matter open, with this\nbrief word to save the reader from a possible perplexity as to\nwhy immortality got no mention in the body of this book.",
        "The ideal power with which we feel ourselves in connection, the\n\"God” of ordinary men, is, both by ordinary men and by\nphilosophers, endowed with certain of those metaphysical\nattributes which in the lecture on philosophy I treated with such\ndisrespect.  He is assumed as a matter of course to be “one and\nonly” and to be “infinite\"; and the notion of many finite gods is\none which hardly any one thinks it worth while to consider, and\nstill less to uphold.  Nevertheless, in the interests of\nintellectual clearness, I feel bound to say that religious\nexperience, as we have studied it, cannot be cited as\nunequivocally supporting the infinitist belief.  The only thing\nthat it unequivocally testifies to is that we can experience\nunion with SOMETHING larger than ourselves and in that union find\nour greatest peace.  Philosophy, with its passion for unity, and\nmysticism with its monoideistic bent, both “pass to the limit\"\nand identify the something with a unique God who is the\nall-inclusive soul of the world.  Popular opinion, respectful to\ntheir authority, follows the example which they set.",
        "Meanwhile the practical needs and experiences of religion seem to\nme sufficiently met by the belief that beyond each man and in a\nfashion continuous with him there exists a larger power which is\nfriendly to him and to his ideals.  All that the facts require is\nthat the power should be both other and larger than our conscious\nselves.  Anything larger will do, if only it be large enough to\ntrust for the next step. It need not be infinite, it need not be\nsolitary.  It might conceivably even be only a larger and more\ngodlike self, of which the present self would then be but the\nmutilated expression, and the universe might conceivably be a\ncollection of such selves, of different degrees of inclusiveness,\nwith no absolute unity realized in it at all.[364] Thus would a\nsort of polytheism return upon us–a polytheism which I do not on\nthis occasion defend, for my only aim at present is to keep the\ntestimony of religious experience clearly within its proper\nbounds.  [Compare p. 130 above.]",
        "[364] Such a notion is suggested in my Ingersoll Lecture On Human\nImmortality, Boston and London, 1899.",
        "Upholders of the monistic view will say to such a polytheism\n(which, by the way, has always been the real religion of common\npeople, and is so still to-day) that unless there be one\nall-inclusive God, our guarantee of security is left imperfect. \nIn the Absolute, and in the Absolute only, ALL is saved.  If\nthere be different gods, each caring for his part, some portion\nof some of us might not be covered with divine protection, and\nour religious consolation would thus fail to be complete.  It\ngoes back to what was said on pages 129-131, about the\npossibility of there being portions of the universe that may\nirretrievably be lost.  Common sense is less sweeping in its\ndemands than philosophy or mysticism have been wont to be, and\ncan suffer the notion of this world being partly saved and partly\nlost.  The ordinary moralistic state of mind makes the salvation\nof the world conditional upon the success with which each unit\ndoes its part.  Partial and conditional salvation is in fact a\nmost familiar notion when taken in the abstract, the only\ndifficulty being to determine the details.  Some men are even\ndisinterested enough to be willing to be in the unsaved remnant\nas far as their persons go, if only they can be persuaded that\ntheir cause will prevail–all of us are willing, whenever our\nactivity-excitement rises sufficiently high.  I think, in fact,\nthat a final philosophy of religion will have to consider the\npluralistic hypothesis more seriously than it has hitherto been\nwilling to consider it.  For practical life at any rate, the\nCHANCE of salvation is enough.  No fact in human nature is more\ncharacteristic than its willingness to live on a chance.  The\nexistence of the chance makes the difference, as Edmund Gurney\nsays, between a life of which the keynote is resignation and a\nlife of which the keynote is hope.[365]  But all these statements\nare unsatisfactory from their brevity, and I can only say that I\nhope to return to the same questions in another book.",

        "The road by which William James arrived at his position of\nleadership among American philosophers was, during his childhood,\nyouth and early maturity, quite as circuitous and unpredictable\nas were his father’s ideas on the training of his children. That\nSwedenborgian theologian foresaw neither the career of novelist\nfor his son Henry, nor that of pragmatist philosopher for the\nolder William.  The father’s migrations between New York, Europe\nand Newport meant that William’s education had variety if it did\nnot have fixed direction.  From 13 to 18 he studied in Europe and\nreturned to Newport, Rhode Island, to study painting under the\nguidance of John La Farge.  After a year, he gave up art for\nscience and entered Harvard University, where his most\ninfluential teachers were Louis Agassiz and Charles W. Eliot. \nIn 1863, William James began the study of medicine, and in 1865\nhe joined an expedition to the Amazon. Before long, he wrote: \n\"If there is anything I hate, it is collecting.” His studies\nconstantly interrupted by ill health, James returned to Germany\nand began hearing lectures and reading voluminously in\nphilosophy.  He won his medical degree at Harvard in 1870.  For\nfour years he was an invalid in Cambridge, but finally, in 1873,\nhe passed his gravest physical and spiritual crises and began the\ncareer by which he was to influence so profoundly generations of\nAmerican students.  From 1880 to 1907 he was successively\nassistant professor of philosophy, professor of psychology and\nprofessor of philosophy at Harvard.  In 1890, the publication of\nhis Principles of Psycholog brought him the acknowledged\nleadership in the field of functional psychology.  The selection\nof William James to deliver the Gifford lectures in Edinburgh was\nat once a tribute to him and a reward for the university that\nsponsored the undertaking.  These lectures, collected in this\nvolume, have since become famous as the standard scientific work\non the psychology of the religious impulse.  Death ended his\ncareer on August 27th, 1910.",
