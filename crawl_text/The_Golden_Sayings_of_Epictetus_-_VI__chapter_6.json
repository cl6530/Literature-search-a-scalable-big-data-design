        "But what saith God?— “Had it been possible, Epictetus, I\nwould have made both that body of thine and thy possessions free\nand unimpeded, but as it is, be not deceived:— it is not thine\nown; it is but finely tempered clay. Since then this I could not\ndo, I have given thee a portion of Myself, in the power of\ndesiring and declining and of pursuing and avoiding, and in a\nword the power of dealing with the things of sense. And if thou\nneglect not this, but place all that thou hast therein, thou\nshalt never be let or hindered; thou shalt never lament; thou\nshalt not blame or flatter any. What then? Seemeth this to thee a\nlittle thing?\"—God forbid!—\"Be content then therewith!”",
