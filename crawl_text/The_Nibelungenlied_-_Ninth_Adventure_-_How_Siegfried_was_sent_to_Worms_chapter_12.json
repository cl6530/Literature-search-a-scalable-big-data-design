        "When that they had journeyed / full nine days on their way,\nThen spake of Tronje Hagen: / “Now hear what I shall say.\nWe tarry with the tidings / for Worms upon the Rhine.\nAt Burgundy already / should now be messengers of thine.”",
        "530",
        "Then outspake King Gunther: / “There hast thou spoken true.\nAnd this selfsame journey, / none were so fit thereto\nAs thyself, friend Hagen. / So do thou now ride on.\nThis our high court journey, / none else can better make it known.”",
        "531",
        "Thereto answered Hagen: / “Poor messenger am I.\nLet me be treasure-warden. / Upon the ships I’ll stay\nNear by the women rather, / their guardian to be,\nTill that we bring them safely / into the land of Burgundy.",
        "532",
        "“Now do thou pray Siegfried / that he the message bear,\nFor he’s a knight most fitting / this thing to have in care.\nIf he decline the journey, / then shalt thou courteously,\nFor kindness to thy sister, / pray that he not unwilling be.”",
        "533",
        "He sent for the good warrior / who came at his command.\nHe spake: “Since we are nearing / home in my own land,\nSo should I send a message / to sister dear of mine\nAnd eke unto my mother, / that we are nigh unto the Rhine.",
        "534",
        "“Thereto I pray thee, Siegfried, / now meet my wish aright,\"\nSpake the noble monarch: / “I’ll ever thee requite.\"\nBut Siegfried still refused it, / the full valiant man,\nTill that King Gunther / sorely to beseech began.",
        "535",
        "He spake: “Now bear the message, / in favor unto me\nAnd eke unto Kriemhild / a maiden fair to see,\nThat the stately maiden / help me thy service pay.\"\nWhen had heard it Siegfried, / ready was the knight straightway.",
        "536",
        "“Now what thou wilt, command me: / ’twill not be long delayed.\nThis thing will I do gladly / for sake of that fair maid.\nWhy should I aught refuse her, / who all my heart hath won?\nWhat thou for her commandest, / whate’er it be ’twill all be done.”",
        "537",
        "“Then say unto my mother, / Ute the queen,\nThat we on our journey / in joyous mood have been.\nLet know likewise my brothers / what fortune us befell.\nEke unto all our kinsmen / shalt thou then merry tidings tell.",
        "538",
        "“Unto my fair sister / shalt thou all confide.\nFrom me bring her fair compliment / and from Brunhild beside,\nAnd eke unto our household / and all my warriors brave.\nWhat my heart e’er did strive for, / how well accomplished it I have!",
        "539",
        "“And say as well to Ortwein / nephew dear of mine\nThat he do bid make ready / at Worms beside the Rhine.\nAnd all my other kindred, / to them made known shall be,\nWith Brunhild I am minded / to keep a great festivity.",
        "540",
        "“And say unto my sister, / when that she hath learned\nThat I am to my country / with many a guest returned,\nShe shall have care to welcome / my bride in fitting way.\nSo all my thoughts of Kriemhild / will be her service to repay.”",
        "541",
        "Then did Sir Siegfried / straightway in parting greet\nHigh the Lady Brunhild, / as ’twas very meet,\nAnd all her company; / then toward the Rhine rode he.\nNor in this world a better / messenger might ever be.",
        "542",
        "With four and twenty warriors / to Worms did he ride.\nWhen soon it was reported / the king came not beside,\nThen did all the household / of direst news have dread:\nThey feared their royal master / were left in distant country dead.",
        "543",
        "Then sprang they from the saddle, / full high they were of mood.\nFull soon before them Giselher / the prince so youthful stood,\nAnd Gernot his brother. / How quickly then spake he,\nWhen he the royal Gunther / saw not in Siegfried’s company:",
        "544",
        "“Be thou welcome, Siegfried. / Yet shalt thou tell to me,\nWhy the king my brother / cometh not with thee.\nBrunhild’s prowess is it / hath taken him, I ween;\nAnd so this lofty wooing / hath naught but our misfortune been.”",
        "545",
        "“Now cease such ill foreboding. / To you and friends hath sent\nMy royal companion / his good compliment.\nSafe and sound I left him; / myself did he command\nThat I should be his herald / with tidings hither to your land.",
        "546",
        "“Quickly shall ye see to it, / how that it may be,\nThat I the queen and likewise / your fair sister see.\nFrom Gunther and Brunhild / the message will I tell\nThat hath now been sent them: / the twain do find them passing well.”",
        "547",
        "Then spake the youthful Giselher: / “So shalt thou go to her:\nHere dost thou on my sister / a favor high confer.\nIn sooth she’s mickle anxious / how’t with my brother be.\nThe maid doth see thee gladly, / –of that will I be surety.”",
        "548",
        "Then outspake Sir Siegfried: / “If serve her aught I can,\nThat same thing most willing / in truth it shall be done.\nWho now will tell the ladies / I would with them confer?\"\nThen was therein Giselher / the stately knight his messenger.",
        "549",
        "Giselher the valiant / unto his mother kind\nAnd sister spake the tidings / when he the twain did find:\n“To us returned is Siegfried, / the hero of Netherlands\nUnto the Rhine he cometh / at my brother Gunther’s command.",
        "550",
        "“He bringeth us the tidings / how’t with the king doth fare.\nNow shall ye give permission / that he ’fore you appear.\nHe’ll tell the proper tidings / from Isenland o’er the main.\"\nYet mickle sad forebodings / did trouble still the ladies twain.",
        "551",
        "They sprang for their attire / and donned it nothing slow.\nThen bade they that Siegfried / to court should thither go.\nThat did he right willing / for he gladly them did see.\nKriemhild the noble maiden / spake to him thus graciously.",
        "552",
        "“Welcome be, Sir Siegfried, / thou knight right praiseworthy.\nYet where may King Gunther / my noble brother be?\nIt is through Brunhild’s prowess, / I ween, he is forlorn.\nAlack of me, poor maiden, / that I into this world was born!”",
        "553",
        "The valiant knight then answered: / “Give me news-bringer’s meed\nKnow ye, fairest ladies, / ye weep without a need.\nI left him well and happy, / that would I have you know;\nThey two have sent me hither / to bear the tidings unto you.",
        "554",
        "“And offer thee good service / both his bride and he,\nMy full noble lady, / in love and loyalty.\nNow give over weeping, / for straight will they be here.\"\nThey had for many a season / heard not a tale to them so dear.",
        "555",
        "With fold of snow-white garment / then her eyes so bright\nDried she after weeping. / She gan thank the knight\nWho of these glad tidings / had been the messenger.\nThen was a mickle sorrow / and cause of weeping ta’en from her.",
        "556",
        "She bade the knight be seated, / which he did willingly.\nThen spake the lovely maiden: / “It were a joy to me,\nCould I the message-bringer / with gold of mine repay.\nThereto art thou too high-born; / I’ll serve thee then in other way.”",
        "557",
        "“If I alone were ruler,\" / spake he, “o’er thirty lands,\nYet gifts I’d take right gladly, / came they from thy fair hands.\"\nThen spake the virtuous maiden: / “In truth it shall be so.\"\nThen bade she her chamberlain / forth for message-money go.",
        "558",
        "Four and twenty armlets / with stones of precious kind,\nThese gave she him for guerdon. / ’Twas not the hero’s mind,\nThat he himself should keep them: / he dealt them all around\nUnto her fair attendants / whom he within the chamber found.",
        "559",
        "Of service, too, her mother / did kindly offer make.\n“Then have I more to tell you,\" / the keen warrior spake:\n“Of what the king doth beg you, / when comes he to the Rhine.\nWilt thou perform it, lady, / then will he e’er to thee incline.",
        "560",
        "“The noble guests he bringeth, / –this heard I him request,\nThat ye shall well receive them; / and furthermore his hest,\nThat ye ride forth to meet him / ’fore Worms upon the strand.\nSo have ye from the monarch / faithfully his high command.”",
        "561",
        "Then spake the lovely maiden: / “Full ready there am I.\nIf I in aught can serve him, / I’ll never that deny.\nIn all good faith and kindness / shall it e’er be done.\"\nThen deeper grew her color / that from increase of joy she won.",
        "562",
        "Never was royal message / better received before.\nThe lady sheer had kissed him, / if ’twere a thing to dare.\nFrom those high ladies took he / his leave in courteous wise.\nThen did they there in Burgundy / in way as Siegfried did advise.",
        "563",
        "Sindold and Hunold / and Rumold the thane\nIn truth were nothing idle, / but wrought with might and main\nTo raise the sitting-places / ’fore Worms upon the strand.\nThere did the royal Steward / busy ’mid the workers stand.",
        "564",
        "Ortwein and Gere / thought longer not to bide,\nBut sent unto their kinsmen / forth on every side.\nThey told of festive meeting / there that was to be;\nAnd deck themselves to meet them / did the maidens fair to see.",
        "565",
        "The walls throughout the palace / were dight full richly all,\nLooking unto the strangers; / and King Gunther’s hall\nFull well with seats and tables / for many a noble guest.\nAnd great was the rejoicing / in prospect of the mighty feast.",
        "566",
        "Then rode from every quarter / hither through the land\nThe three monarchs’ kinsmen, / who there were called to hand,\nThat they might be in waiting / for those expected there.\nThen from enfolding covers / took they store of raiments rare.",
        "567",
        "Some watchers brought the tidings / that Brunhild’s followers were\nSeen coming riding hither. / Then rose a mickle stir\nAmong the folk so many / in the land of Burgundy.\nHeigh-ho! What valiant warriors / alike on both parts might you see!",
        "568",
        "Then spake the fair Kriemhild: / “Of my good maidens, ye\nWho at this reception / shall bear me company,\nFrom out the chests now seek ye / attire the very best.\nSo shall praise and honor / be ours from many a noble guest.”",
        "569",
        "Then came the knights also / and bade bring forth to view\nThe saddles richly furnished / of ruddy golden hue,\nThat ladies fair should ride on / at Worms unto the Rhine.\nBetter horse-equipment / could never artisan design.",
        "570",
        "Heigh-ho! What gold all glancing / from the steeds there shone!\nSparkled from their bridles / full many a precious stone.\nGold-wrought stools for mounting / and shining carpets good\nBrought they for the ladies: / joyous were they all of mood.",
        "571",
        "Within the court the heroes / bedight with trappings due\nAwaited noble maidens, / as I have told to you.\nA narrow band from saddle / went round each horse’s breast,\nIts beauty none could tell you: / of silk it was the very best.",
        "572",
        "Six and eighty ladies / came in manner meet\nWearing each a wimple. / Kriemhild there to greet\nThey went, all fair to look on, / in shining garments clad.\nThen came eke well apparelled / full many a fair and stately maid.",
        "573",
        "Four and fifty were they / of the land of Burgundy,\nAnd they were eke the noblest / that ever you might see.\nAdorned with shining hair-bands / the fair-haired maids came on.\nWhat now the king desired, / that most carefully was done.",
        "574",
        "Made of stuffs all costly, / the best you might desire,\nBefore the gallant strangers / wore they such rich attire\nAs well did fit the beauty / of many amid the throng.\nHe sure had lost his senses, / who could have wished them any wrong.",
        "575",
        "Of sable and of ermine / many a dress was worn.\nArms and hands a many / did they full well adorn\nWith rings o’er silken dresses / that there did clothe them well.\nOf all the ready-making / none might ever fully tell.",
        "576",
        "Full many a well-wrought girdle / in long and costly braid\nAbout the shining garments / by many a hand was laid\nOn dress of precious ferrandine / of silk from Araby.\nAnd full of high rejoicing / were those maids of high degree.",
        "577",
        "With clasps before her bosom / was many a fair maid\nLaced full beauteously. / She might well be sad,\nWhose full beaming color / vied not with weeds she wore.\nSuch a stately company / ne’er possessed a queen before.",
        "578",
        "When now the lovely maidens / attired you might see,\nSoon were those beside them / should bear them company,\nOf warriors high-hearted / a full mickle band.\nAnd with their shields they carried / full many an ashen shaft in hand.",
