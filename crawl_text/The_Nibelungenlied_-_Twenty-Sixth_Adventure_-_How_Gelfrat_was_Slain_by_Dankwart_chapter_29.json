        "When now they all were gathered / upon the farther strand,\nTo wonder gan the monarch: / “Who shall through this land\nOn routes aright direct us, / that not astray we fare?\"\nThen spake the doughty Volker: / “Thereof will I alone have care.”",
        "1587",
        "“Now hark ye all,” quoth Hagen, / “knight and squire too,\nAnd list to friendly counsel, / as fitting is to do.\nFull strange and dark the tidings / now ye shall hear from me:\nHome nevermore return we / unto the land of Burgundy.",
        "1588",
        "“Thus mermaids twain did tell me, / who spake to me this morn,\nThat back we come not hither. / You would I therefore warn\nThat armed well ye journey / and of all ills beware.\nTo meet with doughty foemen / well behooveth us prepare.",
        "1589",
        "“I weened to turn to falsehood / what those wise mermaids spake,\nWho said that safe this journey / none again should make\nHome unto our country / save the chaplain alone:\nHim therefore was I minded / to-day beneath the flood to drown.”",
        "1590",
        "From company to company / quickly flew the tale,\nWhereon grew many a doughty / warrior’s visage pale,\nAs gan he think in sorrow / how death should snatch away\nAll ere the journey ended; / and very need for grief had they.",
        "1591",
        "By Moeringen was it / they had the river crossed,\nWhere also Else’s boatman / thus his life had lost.\nThere again spake Hagen: / “Since in such wise by me\nWrath hath been incurred, / assailed full surely shall we be.",
        "1592",
        "“Myself that same ferryman / did this morning slay.\nFar bruited are the tidings. / Now arm ye for the fray,\nThat if Gelfrat and Else / be minded to beset\nOur train to-day, they surely / with sore discomfiture be met.",
        "1593",
        "“So keen they are, well know I / the thing they’ll not forego.\nYour horses therefore shall ye / make to pace more slow,\nThat never man imagine / we flee away in fear.\"\n“That counsel will I follow,\" / spake the young knight Giselher.",
        "1594",
        "“Who will guide our vanguard / through this hostile land?\"\n“Volker shall do it,” spake they, / “well doth he understand\nWhere leadeth path and highway, / a minstrel brave and keen.\"\nEre full the wish was spoken, / in armor well equipped was seen",
        "1595",
        "Standing the doughty Fiddler. / His helmet fast he bound,\nAnd from his stately armor / shot dazzling light around.\nEke to a staff he fastened / a banner, red of hue.\nAnon with royal masters / came he to sorest sorrow too.",
        "1596",
        "Unto Gelfrat meanwhile / had sure tidings flown,\nHow that was dead his boatman; / the story eke was known\nUnto the doughty Else, / and both did mourn his fate.\nTheir warriors they summoned, / nor must long time for answer wait.",
        "1597",
        "But little space it lasted / –that would I have you know–\nEre that to them hasted / who oft a mickle woe\nHad wrought in stress of battle / and injury full sore;\nTo Gelfrat now came riding / seven hundred knights or more.",
        "1598",
        "When they their foes to follow / so bitterly began,\nLed them both their masters. / Yet all too fast they ran\nAfter the valiant strangers / vengeance straight to wreak.\nEre long from those same leaders / did death full many a warrior take.",
        "1599",
        "Hagen then of Tronje / the thing had ordered there,\n–How of his friends might ever / knight have better care?–\nThat he did keep the rearguard / with warriors many a one,\nAnd Dankwart eke, his brother; / full wisely the thing was done.",
        "1600",
        "When now the day was over / and light they had no more,\nInjury to his followers / gan he to dread full sore.\nThey shield in hand rode onward / through Bavarian land,\nAnd ere they long had waited / beset they were by hostile band.",
        "1601",
        "On either side the highway / and close upon their rear\nOf hoofs was heard the clatter; / too keen the chasers were.\nThen spake the valiant Dankwart: / “The foe is close at hand.\nNow bind we on the helmet, / –wisdom doth the same command.”",
        "1602",
        "Upon the way they halted, / nor else they safe had been.\nThrough the gloom perceived they / of gleaming shields the sheen.\nThereupon would Hagen / longer not delay:\n“Who rideth on the highway?\"– / That must Gelfrat tell straight-way.",
        "1603",
        "Of Bavaria the margrave / thereupon replied:\n“Our enemies now seek we, / and swift upon them ride.\nFain would I discover / who hath my boatman slain.\nA knight he was of valor, / whose death doth cause me grievous pain.”",
        "1604",
        "Then spake of Tronje Hagen: / “And was the boatman thine\nThat would not take us over? / The guilt herein is mine.\nMyself did slay the warrior, / and had, in sooth, good need,\nFor that beneath his valor / I myself full nigh lay dead.",
        "1605",
        "“For pay I rich attire / did bid, and gold a store,\nGood knight, that to thy country / he should us ferry o’er.\nThereat he raged full sorely / and on me swung a blow\nWith a mighty boat-pole, / whereat I eke did angry grow.",
        "1606",
        "“For my sword then reached I / and made his rage to close\nWith a wound all gaping: / so thou thy knight didst lose.\nI’ll give thee satisfaction / as to thee seemeth good.\"\nStraightway began the combat, / for high the twain in valor stood.",
        "1607",
        "“Well know I,” spake Gelfrat, / “when Gunther with his train\nRode through this my country / that we should suffer bane\nFrom Hagen, knight of Tronje. / No more shall he go free,\nBut for my boatman’s slaying / here a hostage must he be.”",
        "1608",
        "Against their shields then lowered / for the charge the spear\nGelfrat and Hagen; / eager to close they were.\nElse and Dankwart / spurred eke in stately way,\nScanning each the other; / then both did valorous arm display.",
        "1609",
        "How might ever heroes / show doughty arm so well?\nBackward from off his charger / from mighty tilt there fell\nHagen the valiant, / by Gelfrat’s hand borne down.\nIn twain was rent the breast-piece: / to Hagen thus a fall was known.",
        "1610",
        "Where met in charge their followers, / did crash of shafts resound.\nRisen eke was Hagen, / who erst unto the ground\nWas borne by mighty lance-thrust, / prone upon the grass.\nI ween that unto Gelfrat / nowise of gentle mood he was.",
        "1611",
        "Who held their horses’ bridles / can I not recount,\nBut soon from out their saddles / did they all dismount.\nHagen and Gelfrat / straightway did fierce engage,\nAnd all their men around them / did eke a furious combat wage.",
        "1612",
        "Though with fierce onslaught Hagen / upon Gelfrat sprung,\nOn his shield the noble margrave / a sword so deftly swung\nThat a piece from off the border / ’mid flying sparks it clave.\nWell-nigh beneath its fury / fell dead King Gunther’s warrior brave.",
        "1613",
        "Unto Dankwart loudly / thereat he gan to cry:\n“Help! ho! my good brother! / Encountered here have I\nA knight of arm full doughty, / from whom I come not free.\"\nThen spake the valiant Dankwart: / “Myself thereof the judge will be.”",
        "1614",
        "Nearer sprang the hero / and smote him such a blow\nWith a keen-edged weapon / that he in death lay low.\nFor his slain brother Else / vengeance thought to take,\nBut soon with all his followers / ’mid havoc swift retreat must make.",
        "1615",
        "Slain was now his brother, / wound himself did bear,\nAnd of his followers eighty / eke had fallen there,\nBy grim death snatched sudden. / Then must the doughty knight,\nFrom Gunther’s men to save him, / turn away in hasty flight.",
        "1616",
        "When that they of Bavaria / did from the carnage flee,\nThe blows that followed after / resounded frightfully;\nFor close the knights of Tronje / upon their enemies chased,\nWho to escape the fury / did quit the field in mickle haste.",
        "1617",
        "Then spake upon their fleeing / Dankwart the doughty thane:\n“Upon our way now let us / backward turn again,\nAnd leave them hence to hasten / all wet with oozing blood.\nUnto our friends return we, / this verily meseemeth good.”",
        "1618",
        "When back they were returned / where did the scathe befall,\nOutspake of Tronje Hagen: / “Now look ye, warriors all,\nWho of our tale is lacking, / or who from us hath been\nHere in battle riven / through the doughty Gelfrat’s spleen.”",
        "1619",
        "Lament they must for warriors / four from them were ta’en.\nBut paid for were they dearly, / for roundabout lay slain\nOf their Bavarian foemen / a hundred or more.\nThe men of Tronje’s bucklers / with blood were wet and tarnished o’er.",
        "1620",
        "From out the clouds of heaven / a space the bright moon shone.\nThen again spake Hagen: / “Bear report let none\nTo my beloved masters / how we here did fare.\nLet them until the morrow / still be free from aught of care.”",
        "1621",
        "When they were back returned / who bore the battle’s stress,\nSore troubled was their company / from very weariness.\n“How long shall we keep saddle?\" / was many a warrior’s quest.\nThen spake the valiant Dankwart: / “Not yet may we find place of rest,",
        "1622",
        "“But on ye all must journey / till day come back again.\"\nVolker, knight of prowess, / who led the foremost train,\nBade to ask the marshal: / “This night where shall we be,\nThat rest them may our chargers, / and eke my royal masters three?”",
        "1623",
        "Thereto spake valiant Dankwart: / “The same I ne’er can say,\nYet may we never rest us / before the break of day.\nWhere then we find it fitting / we’ll lay us on the grass.\"\nWhen they did hear his answer, / what source of grief to all it was!",
        "1624",
        "Still were they unbetrayed / by reeking blood and red,\nUntil the sun in heaven / its shining beams down shed\nAt morn across the hill-tops, / that then the king might see\nHow they had been in battle. / Spake he then full angrily:",
        "1625",
        "“How may this be, friend Hagen? / Scorned ye have, I ween,\nThat I should be beside you, / where coats of mail have been\nThus wet with blood upon you. / Who this thing hath done?\"\nQuoth he: “The same did Else, / who hath this night us set upon.",
        "1626",
        "“To avenge his boatman / did they attack our train.\nBy hand of my brother / hath Gelfrat been slain.\nThen fled Else before us, / and mickle was his need.\nOurs four, and theirs a thousand, / remained behind in battle dead.”",
        "1627",
        "Now can we not inform you / where resting-place they found.\nBut cause to know their passing / had the country-folk around,\nWhen there the sons of Ute / to court did fare in state.\nAt Passau fit reception / did presently the knights await.",
        "1628",
        "The noble monarchs’ uncle, / Bishop Pilgrim that was,\nFull joyous-hearted was he / that through the land did pass\nWith train of lusty warriors / his royal nephews three.\nThat willing was his service, / waited they not long to see.",
        "1629",
        "To greet them on their journey / did friends lack no device,\nYet not to lodge them fully / might Passau’s bounds suffice.\nThey must across the water / where spreading sward they found,\nAnd lodge and tent erected / soon were stretching o’er the ground.",
        "1630",
        "Nor from that spot they onward / might journey all that day,\nAnd eke till night was over, / for pleasant was their stay.\nNext to the land of Ruediger / must they in sooth ride on,\nTo whom full soon the story / of their coming eke was known.",
        "1631",
        "When fitting rest had taken / the knights with travel worn,\nAnd of Etzel’s country / they had reached the bourn,\nA knight they found there sleeping / that ne’er should aught but wake,\nFrom whom of Tronje Hagen / in stealth a mighty sword did take.",
        "1632",
        "Hight in sooth was Eckewart / that same valiant knight.\nFor what was there befallen / was he in sorry plight,\nThat by those heroes’ passing / he had lost his sword.\nAt Ruediger’s marches / found they meagre was the guard.",
        "1633",
        "“O, woe is me dishonored,\" / Eckewart then cried;\n“Yea, rueth me fully sorely, / this Burgundian ride.\nWhat time was taken Siegfried, / did joy depart from me.\nAlack, O Master Ruediger, / how ill my service unto thee!”",
        "1634",
        "Hagen, full well perceiving / the noble warrior’s plight,\nGave him again his weapon / and armbands six full bright.\n“These take, good knight, in token / that thou art still my friend.\nA valiant warrior art thou, / though dost thou lone this border tend.”",
        "1635",
        "“May God thy gifts repay thee,\" / Eckewart replied,\n“Yet rueth me full sorely / that to the Huns ye ride.\nErstwhile slew ye Siegfried / and vengeance have to fear;\nMy rede to you is truly: / “Beware ye well of danger here.”",
        "1636",
        "“Now must God preserve us,\" / answered Hagen there.\n“In sooth for nothing further / have these thanes a care\nThan for place of shelter, / the kings and all their band,\nAnd where this night a refuge / we may find within this land.",
        "1637",
        "“Done to death our horses / with the long journey are,\nAnd food as well exhausted,\" / Hagen did declare.\n“Nor find we aught for purchase; / a host we need instead,\nWho would in kindness give us, / ere this evening, of his bread.”",
        "1638",
        "Thereto gave answer Eckewart: / “I’ll show you such a one,\nThat so warm a welcome / find ye never none\nIn country whatsoever / as here your lot may be,\nAn if ye, thanes full gallant, / the noble Ruediger will see.",
        "1639",
        "He dwelleth by the highway / and is most bounteous host\nThat house e’er had for master. / His heart may graces boast,\nAs in the lovely May-time / the flowrets deck the mead.\nTo do good thanes a service / is for his heart most joyous deed.”",
        "1640",
        "Then spake the royal Gunther: / “Wilt thou my messenger be,\nIf will my dear friend Ruediger, / as favor done to me,\nHis hospitable shelter / with all my warriors share,\nTherefor full to requite thee / shall e’er hereafter be my care.”",
        "1641",
        "“Thy messenger am I gladly,\" / Eckewart replied,\nAnd in right willing manner / straight away did ride,\nThe message thus received / to Ruediger to bear.\nNor did so joyous tidings / for many a season greet his ear.",
        "1642",
        "Hasting to Bechelaren / was seen a noble thane.\nThe same perceived Ruediger, / and spake: “O’er yonder plain\nHither hastens Eckewart, / who Kriemhild’s might doth own.\"\nHe weened that by some foemen / to him had injury been done.",
        "1643",
        "Then passed he forth the gateway / where the messenger did stand.\nHis sword he loosed from girdle / and laid from out his hand.\nThe message that he carried / might he not long withhold\nFrom the master and his kinsmen; / full soon the same to them was told.",
        "1644",
        "He spake unto the margrave: / “I come at high command\nOf the lordly Gunther / of Burgundian land,\nAnd Giselher and Gernot, / his royal brothers twain.\nIn service true commends him / unto thee each lofty thane.",
        "1645",
        "“The like hath Hagen bidden / and Volker as well\nWith homage oft-times proffered. / And more have I to tell,\nThe which King Gunther’s marshal / to thee doth send by me:\nHow that the valiant warriors / do crave thy hospitality.”",
        "1646",
        "With smiling visage Ruediger / made thereto reply:\n“Now joyeth me the story / that the monarchs high\nDo deign to seek my service, / that ne’er refused shall be.\nCome they unto my castle, / ’tis joy and gladness unto me.”",
        "1647",
        "“Dankwart the marshal / hath bidden let thee know\nWho seek with them thy shelter / as through thy land they go:\nThree score of valiant leaders / and thousand knights right good,\nWith squires eke nine thousand.\" / Thereat was he full glad of mood.",
        "1648",
        "“To me ’tis mickle honor,\" / Ruediger then spake,\n“That through my castle’s portals / such guests will entry make,\nFor ne’er hath been occasion / my service yet to lend.\nNow ride ye, men and kinsmen, / and on these lofty knights attend.”",
        "1649",
        "Then to horse did hasten / knight and willing squire,\nFor glad they were at all times / to do their lord’s desire,\nAnd keen that thus their service / should not be rendered late.\nUnwitting Lady Gotelinde / still within her chamber sate.",
