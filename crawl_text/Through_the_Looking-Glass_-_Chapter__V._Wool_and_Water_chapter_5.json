        "\nAlice (frontispiece) by Arthur Rackham, 1907\n",
        "\n\n",
        "  She caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the\nowner:  in another moment the White Queen came running wildly\nthrough the wood, with both arms stretched out wide, as if she\nwere flying, and Alice very civilly went to meet her with the\nshawl.",
        "  ’I’m very glad I happened to be in the way,’ Alice said, as she\nhelped her to put on her shawl again.",
        "  The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened\nsort of way, and kept repeating something in a whisper to\nherself that sounded like ’bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,’\nand Alice felt that if there was to be any conversation at all,\nshe must manage it herself.  So she began rather timidly:  ’Am I\naddressing the White Queen?’",
        "  ’Well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,’ The Queen said.  ’It\nisn’t MY notion of the thing, at all.’",
        "  Alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very\nbeginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, ’If your\nMajesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I’ll do it as\nwell as I can.’",
        "  ’But I don’t want it done at all!’ groaned the poor Queen.\n’I’ve been a-dressing myself for the last two hours.’",
        "  It would have been all the better, as it seemed to Alice, if\nshe had got some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully\nuntidy.  ’Every single thing’s crooked,’ Alice thought to\nherself, ’and she’s all over pins!–may I put your shawl\nstraight for you?’ she added aloud.",
        "  ’I don’t know what’s the matter with it!’ the Queen said, in a\nmelancholy voice.  ’It’s out of temper, I think.  I’ve pinned it\nhere, and I’ve pinned it there, but there’s no pleasing it!’",
        "’It CAN’T go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side,’\nAlice said, as she gently put it right for her; ’and, dear me,\nwhat a state your hair is in!’",
        "  ’The brush has got entangled in it!’ the Queen said with a\nsigh.  ’And I lost the comb yesterday.’",
        "  Alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the\nhair into order.  ’Come, you look rather better now!’ she said,\nafter altering most of the pins.  ’But really you should have a\nlady’s maid!’",
        "  ’I’m sure I’ll take you with pleasure!’ the Queen said.\n’Twopence a week, and jam every other day.’",
        "  Alice couldn’t help laughing, as she said, ’I don’t want you to\nhire ME–and I don’t care for jam.’",
        "  ’It’s very good jam,’ said the Queen.",
        "  ’Well, I don’t want any TO-DAY, at any rate.’",
        "  ’You couldn’t have it if you DID want it,’ the Queen said.\n’The rule is, jam to-morrow and jam yesterday–but never jam\nto-day.’",
        "  ’It MUST come sometimes to “jam to-day,\"’ Alice objected.",
        "  ’No, it can’t,’ said the Queen.  ’It’s jam every OTHER day:\nto-day isn’t any OTHER day, you know.’",
        "  ’I don’t understand you,’ said Alice.  ’It’s dreadfully\nconfusing!’",
        "  ’That’s the effect of living backwards,’ the Queen said kindly:\n’it always makes one a little giddy at first–’",
        "  ’Living backwards!’ Alice repeated in great astonishment.  ’I\nnever heard of such a thing!’",
        "  ’–but there’s one great advantage in it, that one’s memory\nworks both ways.’",
        "  ’I’m sure MINE only works one way.’ Alice remarked.  ’I can’t\nremember things before they happen.’",
        "  ’It’s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,’ the\nQueen remarked.",
        "  ’What sort of things do YOU remember best?’ Alice ventured to\nask.",
        "  ’Oh, things that happened the week after next,’ the Queen\nreplied in a careless tone.  ’For instance, now,’ she went on,\nsticking a large piece of plaster [band-aid] on her finger as she\nspoke, ’there’s the King’s Messenger.  He’s in prison now, being\npunished:  and the trial doesn’t even begin till next Wednesday:\nand of course the crime comes last of all.’",
        "  ’Suppose he never commits the crime?’ said Alice.",
        "  ’That would be all the better, wouldn’t it?’ the Queen said,\nas she bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.",
        "  Alice felt there was no denying THAT.  ’Of course it would be\nall the better,’ she said:  ’but it wouldn’t be all the better\nhis being punished.’",
        "  ’You’re wrong THERE, at any rate,’ said the Queen: ’were YOU\never punished?’",
        "  ’Only for faults,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’And you were all the better for it, I know!’ the Queen said\ntriumphantly.",
        "  ’Yes, but then I HAD done the things I was punished for,’ said\nAlice:  ’that makes all the difference.’",
        "  ’But if you HADN’T done them,’ the Queen said, ’that would have\nbeen better still; better, and better, and better!’  Her voice went\nhigher with each ’better,’ till it got quite to a squeak at last.",
        "  Alice was just beginning to say ’There’s a mistake somewhere–,’\nwhen the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave\nthe sentence unfinished.  ’Oh, oh, oh!’ shouted the Queen,\nshaking her hand about as if she wanted to shake it off.\n’My finger’s bleeding!  Oh, oh, oh, oh!’",
        "  Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine,\nthat Alice had to hold both her hands over her ears.",
        "  ’What IS the matter?’ she said, as soon as there was a chance\nof making herself heard.  ’Have you pricked your finger?’",
        "  ’I haven’t pricked it YET,’ the Queen said, ’but I soon shall–\noh, oh, oh!’",
        "  ’When do you expect to do it?’ Alice asked, feeling very much\ninclined to laugh.",
        "  ’When I fasten my shawl again,’ the poor Queen groaned out:\n’the brooch will come undone directly.  Oh, oh!’  As she said the\nwords the brooch flew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it,\nand tried to clasp it again.",
        "  ’Take care!’ cried Alice.  ’You’re holding it all crooked!’\nAnd she caught at the brooch; but it was too late:  the pin had\nslipped, and the Queen had pricked her finger.",
        "  ’That accounts for the bleeding, you see,’ she said to Alice\nwith a smile.  ’Now you understand the way things happen here.’",
        "  ’But why don’t you scream now?’  Alice asked, holding her hands\nready to put over her ears again.",
        "  ’Why, I’ve done all the screaming already,’ said the Queen.\n’What would be the good of having it all over again?’",
        "  By this time it was getting light.  ’The crow must have flown\naway, I think,’ said Alice:  ’I’m so glad it’s gone.  I thought\nit was the night coming on.’",
        "  ’I wish I could manage to be glad!’ the Queen said.  ’Only I\nnever can remember the rule.  You must be very happy, living in\nthis wood, and being glad whenever you like!’",
        "  ’Only it is so VERY lonely here!’ Alice said in a melancholy\nvoice; and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came\nrolling down her cheeks.",
        "  ’Oh, don’t go on like that!’ cried the poor Queen, wringing her\nhands in despair.  ’Consider what a great girl you are.  Consider\nwhat a long way you’ve come to-day.  Consider what o’clock it is.\nConsider anything, only don’t cry!’",
        "  Alice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears.\n’Can YOU keep from crying by considering things?’ she asked.",
        "  ’That’s the way it’s done,’ the Queen said with great decision:\n’nobody can do two things at once, you know.  Let’s consider your age\nto begin with–how old are you?’",
        "  ’I’m seven and a half exactly.’",
        "  ’You needn’t say “exactually,\"’ the Queen remarked:  ’I can\nbelieve it without that.  Now I’ll give YOU something to believe.\nI’m just one hundred and one, five months and a day.’",
        "  ’I can’t believe THAT!’ said Alice.",
        "  ’Can’t you?’ the Queen said in a pitying tone.  ’Try again:\ndraw a long breath, and shut your eyes.’",
        "  Alice laughed.  ’There’s no use trying,’ she said: ’one CAN’T\nbelieve impossible things.’",
        "  ’I daresay you haven’t had much practice,’ said the Queen.\n’When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day.\nWhy, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things\nbefore breakfast.  There goes the shawl again!’",
        "  The brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of\nwind blew the Queen’s shawl across a little brook.  The Queen\nspread out her arms again, and went flying after it, and this\ntime she succeeded in catching it for herself.  ’I’ve got it!’\nshe cried in a triumphant tone.  ’Now you shall see me pin it\non again, all by myself!’",
        "  ’Then I hope your finger is better now?’ Alice said very\npolitely, as she crossed the little brook after the Queen.",
        "  ’Oh, much better!’ cried the Queen, her voice rising to a\nsqueak as she went on.  ’Much be-etter!  Be-etter!  Be-e-e-etter!\nBe-e-ehh!’  The last word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep\nthat Alice quite started.",
        "  She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped\nherself up in wool.  Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again.\nShe couldn’t make out what had happened at all.  Was she in a\nshop?  And was that really–was it really a SHEEP that was\nsitting on the other side of the counter?  Rub as she could, she\ncould make nothing more of it:  she was in a little dark shop,\nleaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was an\nold Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and\nthen leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.",
        "  ’What is it you want to buy?’ the Sheep said at last, looking\nup for a moment from her knitting.",
        "  ’I don’t QUITE know yet,’ Alice said, very gently.  ’I should\nlike to look all round me first, if I might.’",
        "  ’You may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,’\nsaid the Sheep:  ’but you can’t look ALL round you–unless\nyou’ve got eyes at the back of your head.’",
        "  But these, as it happened, Alice had NOT got:  so she contented herself\nwith turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.",
        "  The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things–\nbut the oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard\nat any shelf, to make out exactly what it had on it, that\nparticular shelf was always quite empty:  though the others round\nit were crowded as full as they could hold.",
        "  ’Things flow about so here!’ she said at last in a plaintive\ntone, after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a\nlarge bright thing, that looked sometimes like a doll and\nsometimes like a work-box, and was always in the shelf next above\nthe one she was looking at.  ’And this one is the most provoking\nof all–but I’ll tell you what–’ she added, as a sudden\nthought struck her, ’I’ll follow it up to the very top shelf of\nall.  It’ll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, I expect!’",
        "  But even this plan failed:  the ’thing’ went through the\nceiling as quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it.",
        "  ’Are you a child or a teetotum?’ the Sheep said, as she took up\nanother pair of needles.  ’You’ll make me giddy soon, if you go\non turning round like that.’  She was now working with fourteen\npairs at once, and Alice couldn’t help looking at her in great\nastonishment.",
        "  ’How CAN she knit with so many?’ the puzzled child thought to\nherself.  ’She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!’",
        "  ’Can you row?’ the Sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-\nneedles as she spoke.",
        "  ’Yes, a little–but not on land–and not with needles–’\nAlice was beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into\noars in her hands, and she found they were in a little boat,\ngliding along between banks:  so there was nothing for it but to\ndo her best.",
        "  ’Feather!’ cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of\nneedles.",
        "  This didn’t sound like a remark that needed any answer, so\nAlice said nothing, but pulled away.  There was something very\nqueer about the water, she thought, as every now and then the\noars got fast in it, and would hardly come out again.",
        "  ’Feather!  Feather!’ the Sheep cried again, taking more\nneedles.  ’You’ll be catching a crab directly.’",
        "  ’A dear little crab!’ thought Alice.  ’I should like that.’",
        "  ’Didn’t you hear me say “Feather”?’ the Sheep cried angrily,\ntaking up quite a bunch of needles.",
        "  ’Indeed I did,’ said Alice:  ’you’ve said it very often–and\nvery loud.  Please, where ARE the crabs?’",
        "  ’In the water, of course!’ said the Sheep, sticking some of the\nneedles into her hair, as her hands were full.  ’Feather, I say!’",
        "  ’WHY do you say “feather” so often?’ Alice asked at last,\nrather vexed.  ’I’m not a bird!’",
        "  ’You are,’ said the Sheep:  ’you’re a little goose.’",
        "  This offended Alice a little, so there was no more conversation\nfor a minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes\namong beds of weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water,\nworse then ever), and sometimes under trees, but always with the\nsame tall river-banks frowning over their heads.",
        "  ’Oh, please!  There are some scented rushes!’ Alice cried in a\nsudden transport of delight.  ’There really are–and SUCH\nbeauties!’",
        "  ’You needn’t say “please” to ME about ’em’ the Sheep said,\nwithout looking up from her knitting:  ’I didn’t put ’em there,\nand I’m not going to take ’em away.’",
        "  ’No, but I meant–please, may we wait and pick some?’ Alice\npleaded.  ’If you don’t mind stopping the boat for a minute.’",
        "  ’How am I to stop it?’ said the Sheep.  ’If you leave off\nrowing, it’ll stop of itself.’",
        "  So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till\nit glided gently in among the waving rushes.  And then the little\nsleeves were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were\nplunged in elbow-deep to get the rushes a good long way down\nbefore breaking them off–and for a while Alice forgot all\nabout the Sheep and the knitting, as she bent over the side of\nthe boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the\nwater–while with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch\nafter another of the darling scented rushes.",
        "  ’I only hope the boat won’t tipple over!’ she said to herself.\nOh, WHAT a lovely one!  Only I couldn’t quite reach it.’  ’And it\ncertainly DID seem a little provoking (’almost as if it happened\non purpose,’ she thought) that, though she managed to pick plenty\nof beautiful rushes as the boat glided by, there was always a\nmore lovely one that she couldn’t reach.",
        "  ’The prettiest are always further!’ she said at last, with a\nsigh at the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as,\nwith flushed cheeks and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled\nback into her place, and began to arrange her new-found treasures.",
        "  What mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to\nfade, and to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very\nmoment that she picked them?  Even real scented rushes, you know,\nlast only a very little while–and these, being dream-rushes,\nmelted away almost like snow, as they lay in heaps at her feet–\nbut Alice hardly noticed this, there were so many other curious\nthings to think about.",
        "  They hadn’t gone much farther before the blade of one of the\noars got fast in the water and WOULDN’T come out again (so Alice\nexplained it afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle\nof it caught her under the chin, and, in spite of a series of\nlittle shrieks of ’Oh, oh, oh!’ from poor Alice, it swept her\nstraight off the seat, and down among the heap of rushes.",
        "  However, she wasn’t hurt, and was soon up again:  the Sheep\nwent on with her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had\nhappened.  ’That was a nice crab you caught!’ she remarked, as\nAlice got back into her place, very much relieved to find herself\nstill in the boat.",
        "  ’Was it?  I didn’t see it,’ Said Alice, peeping cautiously over\nthe side of the boat into the dark water.  ’I wish it hadn’t let\ngo–I should so like to see a little crab to take home with\nme!’  But the Sheep only laughed scornfully, and went on with her\nknitting.",
        "  ’Are there many crabs here?’ said Alice.",
        "  ’Crabs, and all sorts of things,’ said the Sheep:  ’plenty of\nchoice, only make up your mind.  Now, what DO you want to buy?’",
        "  ’To buy!’ Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and\nhalf frightened–for the oars, and the boat, and the river,\nhad vanished all in a moment, and she was back again in the\nlittle dark shop.",
        "  ’I should like to buy an egg, please,’ she said timidly.  ’How\ndo you sell them?’",
        "  ’Fivepence farthing for one–Twopence for two,’ the Sheep\nreplied.",
        "  ’Then two are cheaper than one?’ Alice said in a surprised\ntone, taking out her purse.",
        "  ’Only you MUST eat them both, if you buy two,’ said the Sheep.",
        "  ’Then I’ll have ONE, please,’ said Alice, as she put the money\ndown on the counter.  For she thought to herself, ’They mightn’t\nbe at all nice, you know.’",
        "  The Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box:  then she\nsaid ’I never put things into people’s hands–that would never\ndo–you must get it for yourself.’  And so saying, she went off\nto the other end of the shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf.",
        "  ’I wonder WHY it wouldn’t do?’ thought Alice, as she groped her\nway among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark\ntowards the end.  ’The egg seems to get further away the more I\nwalk towards it.  Let me see, is this a chair?  Why, it’s got\nbranches, I declare!  How very odd to find trees growing here!\nAnd actually here’s a little brook!  Well, this is the very\nqueerest shop I ever saw!’",
        "  So she went on, wondering more and more at every step, as\neverything turned into a tree the moment she came up to it, and\nshe quite expected the egg to do the same.",
