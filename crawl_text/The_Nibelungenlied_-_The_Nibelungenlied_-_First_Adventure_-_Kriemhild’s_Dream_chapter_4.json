        "To us in olden story / are wonders many told\nOf heroes rich in glory, / of trials manifold:\nOf joy and festive greeting, / of weeping and of woe,\nOf keenest warriors meeting, / shall ye now many a wonder know.",
        "2",
        "There once grew up in Burgundy / a maid of noble birth,\nNor might there be a fairer / than she in all the earth:\nKriemhild hight the maiden, / and grew a dame full fair,\nThrough whom high thanes a many / to lose their lives soon doomed were.",
        "3",
        "’Twould well become the highest / to love the winsome maid,\nKeen knights did long to win her, / and none but homage paid.\nBeauty without measure, / that in sooth had she,\nAnd virtues wherewith many / ladies else adorned might be.",
        "4",
        "Three noble lords did guard her, / great as well in might,\nGunther and Gernot, / each one a worthy knight,\nAnd Giselher their brother, / a hero young and rare.\nThe lady was their sister / and lived beneath the princes’ care.",
        "5",
        "These lords were free in giving, / and born of high degree;\nUndaunted was the valor / of all the chosen three.\nIt was the land of Burgundy / o’er which they did command,\nAnd mighty deeds of wonder / they wrought anon in Etzel’s land.",
        "6",
        "At Worms amid their warriors / they dwelt, the Rhine beside,\nAnd in their lands did serve them / knights of mickle pride,\nWho till their days were ended / maintained them high in state.\nThey later sadly perished / beneath two noble women’s hate.",
        "7",
        "A high and royal lady, / Ute their mother hight,\nTheir father’s name was Dankrat, / a man of mickle might.\nTo them his wealth bequeathed he / when that his life was done,\nFor while he yet was youthful / had he in sooth great honor won.",
        "8",
        "In truth were these three rulers, / as I before did say,\nGreat and high in power, / and homage true had they\nEke of knights the boldest / and best that e’er were known,\nKeen men all and valiant, / as they in battle oft had shown.",
        "9",
        "There was of Tronje Hagen, / and of that princely line\nHis brother valiant Dankwart; / and eke of Metz Ortwein;\nThen further the two margraves, / Gere and Eckewart;\nOf Alzei was Volker, / a doughty man of dauntless heart.",
        "10",
        "Rumold the High Steward, / a chosen man was he,\nSindold and Hunold / they tended carefully\nEach his lofty office / in their three masters’ state,\nAnd many a knight beside them / that I the tale may ne’er relate.",
        "11",
        "Dankwart he was Marshal; / his nephew, then, Ortwein\nUpon the monarch waited / when that he did dine;\nSindold was Cup-bearer, / a stately thane was he,\nAnd Chamberlain was Hunold, / masters all in courtesy.",
        "12",
        "Of the kings’ high honor / and their far-reaching might,\nOf their full lofty majesty / and how each gallant knight\nFound his chiefest pleasure / in the life of chivalry,\nIn sooth by mortal never / might it full related be.",
        "13",
        "Amid this life so noble / did dream the fair Kriemhild\nHow that she reared a falcon, / in beauty strong and wild,\nThat by two eagles perished; / the cruel sight to see\nDid fill her heart with sorrow / as great as in this world might be.",
        "14",
        "The dream then to her mother / Queen Ute she told,\nBut she could not the vision / than thus more clear unfold:\n“The falcon that thou rearedst, / doth mean a noble spouse:\nGod guard him well from evil / or thou thy hero soon must lose.”",
        "15",
        "“Of spouse, O darling mother, / what dost thou tell to me?\nWithout a knight to woo me, / so will I ever be,\nUnto my latest hour / I’ll live a simple maid,\nThat I through lover’s wooing / ne’er be brought to direst need.”",
        "16",
        "“Forswear it not so rashly,\" / her mother then replied.\n“On earth if thou wilt ever / cast all care aside,\n’Tis love alone will do it; / thou shalt be man’s delight,\nIf God but kindly grant thee / to wed a right good valiant knight.”",
        "17",
        "“Now urge the case, dear mother,\" / quoth she, “not further here.\nFate of many another / dame hath shown full clear\nHow joy at last doth sorrow / lead oft-times in its train.\nThat I no ruth may borrow, / from both alike I’ll far remain.”",
        "18",
        "Long time, too, did Kriemhild / her heart from love hold free,\nAnd many a day the maiden / lived right happily,\nEre good knight saw she any / whom she would wish to woo.\nIn honor yet she wedded / anon a worthy knight and true.",
        "19",
        "He was that same falcon / she saw the dream within\nUnfolded by her mother. / Upon her nearest kin,\nThat they did slay him later, / how wreaked she vengeance wild!\nThrough death of this one hero / died many another mother’s child.",
