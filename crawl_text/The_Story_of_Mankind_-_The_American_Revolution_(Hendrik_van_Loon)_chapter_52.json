        "AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\nEUROPE HEARD STRANGE REPORTS OF\nSOMETHING WHICH HAD HAPPENED IN\nTHE WILDERNESS; OF THE NORTH AMERICAN\nCONTINENT. THE DESCENDANTS\nOF THE MEN WHO HAD PUNISHED KING\nCHARLES FOR HIS INSISTENCE UPON HIS\n“DIVINE RIGHTS” ADDED A NEW CHAPTER\nTO THE OLD STORY OF THE STRUGGLE\nFOR SELF-GOVERNMENT",
        "FOR the sake of convenience, we ought to go back a\nfew centuries and repeat the early history of the great\nstruggle for colonial possessions.",
        "As soon as a number of European nations had been\ncreated upon the new basis of national or dynastic interests,\nthat is to say, during and immediately after the Thirty\nYears War, their rulers, backed up by the capital of\ntheir merchants and the ships of their trading companies,\ncontinued the fight for more territory in Asia, Africa and America.",
        "The Spaniards and the Portuguese had been exploring the\nIndian Sea and the Pacific Ocean for more than a century ere\nHolland and England appeared upon the stage. This proved\nan advantage to the latter. The first rough work had already\nbeen done. What is more, the earliest navigators had so often\nmade themselves unpopular with the Asiatic and American and\nAfrican natives that both the English and the Dutch were\nwelcomed as friends and deliverers. We cannot claim any\nsuperior virtues for either of these two races. But they were\nmerchants before everything else. They never allowed religious\nconsiderations to interfere with their practical common sense.\nDuring their first relations with weaker races, all European\nnations have behaved with shocking brutality. The English and\nthe Dutch, however, knew better where to draw the dine. Provided\nthey got their spices and their gold and silver and their taxes,\nthey were willing to let the native live as it best pleased him.",
        "It was not very difficult for them therefore to establish\nthemselves in the richest parts of the world. But as soon as\nthis had been accomplished, they began to fight each other for\nstill further possessions. Strangely enough, the colonial wars\nwere never settled in the colonies themselves. They were decided\nthree thousand miles away by the navies of the contending\ncountries. It is one of the most interesting principles of ancient\nand modern warfare (one of the few reliable laws of\nhistory) that “the nation which commands the sea is also the\nnation which commands the land.” So far this law has never\nfailed to work, but the modern airplane may have changed it.\nIn the eighteenth century, however, there were no flying machines\nand it was the British navy which gained for England\nher vast American and Indian and African colonies.",
        "The series of naval wars between England and Holland in\nthe seventeenth century does not interest us here. It ended as\nall such encounters between hopelessly ill-matched powers will\nend. But the warfare between England and France (her other\nrival) is of greater importance to us, for while the superior\nBritish fleet in the end defeated the French navy, a great deal\nof the preliminary fighting was done on our own American\ncontinent. In this vast country, both France and England\nclaimed everything which had been discovered and a lot more\nwhich the eye of no white man had ever seen. In 1497 Cabot\nhad landed in the northern part of America and twenty-seven\nyears later, Giovanni Verrazano had visited these coasts. Cabot\nhad flown the English flag. Verrazano had sailed under the\nFrench flag. Hence both England and France proclaimed\nthemselves the owners of the entire continent.",
        "During the seventeenth century, some ten small English\ncolonies had been founded between Maine and the Carolinas.\nThey were usually a haven of refuge for some particular sect\nof English dissenters, such as the Puritans, who in the year\n1620 went to New England, or the Quakers, who settled in\nPennsylvania in 1681. They were small frontier communities,\nnestling close to the shores of the ocean, where people had\ngathered to make a new home and begin life among happier\nsurroundings, far away from royal supervision and interference.",
        "The French colonies, on the other hand, always remained\na possession of the crown. No Huguenots or Protestants were\nallowed in these colonies for fear that they might contaminate\nthe Indians with their dangerous Protestant doctrines and\nwould perhaps interfere with the missionary work of the Jesuit\nfathers. The English colonies, therefore, had been founded\nupon a much healthier basis than their French neighbours and\nrivals. They were an expression of the commercial energy of\nthe English middle classes, while the French settlements were\ninhabited by people who had crossed the ocean as servants of the\nking and who expected to return to Paris at the first possible chance.",
        "Politically, however, the position of the English colonies\nwas far from satisfactory. The French had discovered the\nmouth of the Saint Lawrence in the sixteenth century. From\nthe region of the Great Lakes they had worked their way southward,\nhad descended the Mississippi and had built several fortifications\nalong the Gulf of Mexico. After a century of exploration,\na line of sixty French forts cut off the English settlements\nalong the Atlantic seaboard from the interior.",
        "The English land grants, made to the different colonial\ncompanies had given them “all land from sea to sea.” This\nsounded well on paper, but in practice, British territory\nended where the line of French fortifications began. To break\nthrough this barrier was possible but it took both men and\nmoney and caused a series of horrible border wars in which\nboth sides murdered their white neighbours, with the help of the\nIndian tribes.",
        "As long as the Stuarts had ruled England there had been\nno danger of war with France. The Stuarts needed the Bourbons\nin their attempt to establish an autocratic form of government\nand to break the power of Parliament. But in 1689 the\nlast of the Stuarts had disappeared from British soil and Dutch\nWilliam, the great enemy of Louis XIV succeeded him. From\nthat time on, until the Treaty of Paris of 1763, France and\nEngland fought for the possession of India and North America.",
        "During these wars, as I have said before, the English navies\ninvariably beat the French. Cut off from her colonies, France\nlost most of her possessions, and when peace was declared, the\nentire North American continent had fallen into British hands\nand the great work of exploration of Cartier, Champlain, La\nSalle, Marquette and a score of others was lost to France.",
        "Only a very small part of this vast domain was inhabited.\nFrom Massachusetts in the north, where the Pilgrims (a sect\nof Puritans who were very intolerant and who therefore had\nfound no happiness either in Anglican England or Calvinist\nHolland) had landed in the year 1620, to the Carolinas and\nVirginia (the tobacco-raising provinces which had been founded\nentirely for the sake of profit), stretched a thin line of\nsparsely populated territory. But the men who lived in this\nnew land of fresh air and high skies were very different from\ntheir brethren of the mother country. In the wilderness they\nhad learned independence and self-reliance. They were the\nsons of hardy and energetic ancestors. Lazy and timourous\npeople did not cross the ocean in those days. The American\ncolonists hated the restraint and the lack of breathing space\nwhich had made their lives in the old country so very unhappy.\nThey meant to be their own masters. This the ruling classes\nof England did not seem to understand. The government annoyed\nthe colonists and the colonists, who hated to be bothered\nin this way, began to annoy the British government.",
        "Bad feeling caused more bad feeling. It is not necessary\nto repeat here in detail what actually happened and what might\nhave been avoided if the British king had been more intelligent\nthan George III or less given to drowsiness and indifference\nthan his minister, Lord North. The British colonists,\nwhen they understood that peaceful arguments would not\nsettle the difficulties, took to arms. From being loyal subjects,\nthey turned rebels, who exposed themselves to the punishment\nof death when they were captured by the German\nsoldiers, whom George hired to do his fighting after the pleasant\ncustom of that day, when Teutonic princes sold whole\nregiments to the highest bidder.",
        "The war between England and her American colonies\nlasted seven years. During most of that time, the final success\nof the rebels seemed very doubtful. A great number of\nthe people, especially in the cities, had remained loyal to their\nking. They were in favour of a compromise, and would have\nbeen willing to sue for peace. But the great figure of Washington\nstood guard over the cause of the colonists.",
        "Ably assisted by a handful of brave men, he used his steadfast\nbut badly equipped armies to weaken the forces of the king.\nTime and again when defeat seemed unavoidable, his strategy\nturned the tide of battle. Often his men were ill-fed. During\nthe winter they lacked shoes and coats and were forced to live\nin unhealthy dug-outs. But their trust in their great leader\nwas absolute and they stuck it out until the final hour of victory.",
        "But more interesting than the campaigns of Washington\nor the diplomatic triumphs of Benjamin Franklin who was\nin Europe getting money from the French government and\nthe Amsterdam bankers, was an event which occurred early in\nthe revolution. The representatives of the different colonies\nhad gathered in Philadelphia to discuss matters of common\nimportance. It was the first year of the Revolution. Most\nof the big towns of the sea coast were still in the hands of the\nBritish. Reinforcements from England were arriving by the\nship load. Only men who were deeply convinced of the righteousness\nof their cause would have found the courage to take\nthe momentous decision of the months of June and July of\nthe year 1776.",
        "In June, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia proposed a motion\nto the Continental Congress that “these united colonies\nare, and of right ought to be, free and independent states, that\nthey are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and\nthat all political connection between them and the state of\nGreat Britain is and ought to be, totally dissolved.”",
        "The motion was seconded by John Adams of Massachusetts.\nIt was carried on July the second and on July fourth,\nit was followed by an official Declaration of Independence,\nwhich was the work of Thomas Jefferson, a serious and exceedingly\ncapable student of both politics and government and\ndestined to be one of the most famous of our American presidents.",
        "When news of this event reached Europe, and was followed\nby the final victory of the colonists and the adoption of\nthe famous Constitution of the year 1787 (the first of all written\nconstitutions) it caused great interest. The dynastic system\nof the highly centralised states which had been developed\nafter the great religious wars of the seventeenth century had\nreached the height of its power. Everywhere the palace of\nthe king had grown to enormous proportions, while the cities\nof the royal realm were being surrounded by rapidly growing\nacres of slums. The inhabitants of those slums were showing\nsigns of restlessness. They were quite helpless. But the\nhigher classes, the nobles and the professional men, they too\nwere beginning to have certain doubts about the economic and\npolitical conditions under which they lived. The success of\nthe American colonists showed them that many things were\npossible which had been held impossible only a short time\nbefore.",
        "According to the poet, the shot which opened the battle\nof Lexington was “heard around the world.” That was a bit\nof an exaggeration. The Chinese and the Japanese and the\nRussians (not to speak of the Australians, who had just been\nre-discovered by Captain Cook, whom they killed for his\ntrouble,) never heard of it at all. But it carried across the\nAtlantic Ocean. It landed in the powder house of European\ndiscontent and in France it caused an explosion which rocked\nthe entire continent from Petrograd to Madrid and buried the\nrepresentatives of the old statecraft and the old diplomacy\nunder several tons of democratic bricks.",
