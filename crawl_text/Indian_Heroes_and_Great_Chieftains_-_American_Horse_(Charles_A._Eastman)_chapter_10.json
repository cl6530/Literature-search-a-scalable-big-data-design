        "One of the wittiest and shrewdest of the Sioux chiefs was American\nHorse, who succeeded to the name and position of an uncle, killed\nin the battle of Slim Buttes in 1876.  The younger American Horse\nwas born a little before the encroachments of the whites upon the\nSioux country became serious and their methods aggressive, and his\nearly manhood brought him into that most trying and critical period\nof our history.  He had been tutored by his uncle, since his own\nfather was killed in battle while he was still very young.  The\nAmerican Horse band was closely attached to a trading post, and its\nmembers in consequence were inclined to be friendly with the\nwhites, a policy closely adhered to by their leader.",
        "When he was born, his old grandfather said: “Put him out in\nthe sun!  Let him ask his great-grandfather, the Sun, for the warm\nblood of a warrior!”  And he had warm blood.  He was a genial man,\nliking notoriety and excitement.  He always seized an opportunity\nto leap into the center of the arena.",
        "In early life he was a clownish sort of boy among the boys –\nan expert mimic and impersonator.  This talent made him popular and\nin his way a leader.  He was a natural actor, and early showed\nmarked ability as a speaker.",
        "American Horse was about ten years old when he was attacked by\nthree Crow warriors, while driving a herd of ponies to water.  Here\nhe displayed native cunning and initiative.  It seemed he had\nscarcely a chance to escape, for the enemy was near.  He yelled\nfrantically at the ponies to start them toward home, while he\ndropped off into a thicket of willows and hid there.  A part of the\nherd was caught in sight of the camp and there was a counter chase,\nbut the Crows got away with the ponies.  Of course his mother was\nfrantic, believing her boy had been killed or captured; but after\nthe excitement was over, he appeared in camp unhurt.  When\nquestioned about his escape, he remarked: “I knew they would not\ntake the time to hunt for small game when there was so much bigger\nclose by.”",
        "When he was quite a big boy, he joined in a buffalo hunt, and\non the way back with the rest of the hunters his mule became\nunmanageable.  American Horse had insisted on riding him in\naddition to a heavy load of meat and skins, and the animal\nevidently resented this, for he suddenly began to run and kick,\nscattering fresh meat along the road, to the merriment of the\ncrowd.  But the boy turned actor, and made it appear that it was at\nhis wish the mule had given this diverting performance.  He clung\nto the back of his plunging and braying mount like a circus rider,\nsinging a Brave Heart song, and finally brought up amid the\nlaughter and cheers of his companions.  Far from admitting defeat,\nhe boasted of his horsemanship and declared that his “brother” the\ndonkey would put any enemy to flight, and that they should be\ncalled upon to lead a charge.",
        "It was several years later that he went to sleep early one\nnight and slept soundly, having been scouting for two nights\nprevious.  It happened that there was a raid by the Crows, and when\nhe awoke in the midst of the yelling and confusion, he sprang up\nand attempted to join in the fighting.  Everybody knew his voice in\nall the din, so when he fired his gun and announced a coup, as was\nthe custom, others rushed to the spot, to find that he had shot a\nhobbled pony belonging to their own camp.  The laugh was on him,\nand he never recovered from his chagrin at this mistake.  In fact,\nalthough he was undoubtedly fearless and tried hard to distinguish\nhimself in warfare, he did not succeed.",
        "It is told of him that he once went with a war party of young\nmen to the Wind River country against the Shoshones.  At last they\ndiscovered a large camp, but there were only a dozen or so of the\nSioux, therefore they hid themselves and watched for their\nopportunity to attack an isolated party of hunters.  While waiting\nthus, they ran short of food.  One day a small party of Shoshones\nwas seen near at hand, and in the midst of the excitement and\npreparations for the attack, young American Horse caught sight of\na fat black-tail deer close by.  Unable to resist the temptation,\nhe pulled an arrow from his quiver and sent it through the deer’s\nheart, then with several of his half-starved companions sprang upon\nthe yet quivering body of the animal to cut out the liver, which\nwas sometimes eaten raw.  One of the men was knocked down, it is\nsaid, by the last kick of the dying buck, but having swallowed a\nfew mouthfuls the warriors rushed upon and routed their enemies. \nIt is still told of American Horse how he killed game and feasted\nbetween the ambush and the attack.",
        "At another time he was drying his sacred war bonnet and other\ngear over a small fire.  These articles were held in great\nveneration by the Indians and handled accordingly.  Suddenly the\nfire blazed up, and our hero so far forgot himself as to begin\nenergetically beating out the flames with the war bonnet, breaking\noff one of the sacred buffalo horns in the act.  One could almost\nfill a book with his mishaps and exploits.  I will give one of them\nin his own words as well as I can remember them.",
        "“We were as promising a party of young warriors as our tribe\never sent against any of its ancestral enemies.  It was midsummer,\nand after going two days’ journey from home we began to send two\nscouts ahead daily while the main body kept a half day behind.  The\nscouts set out every evening and traveled all night.  One night the\ngreat war pipe was held out to me and to Young-Man-Afraid-of-\nHis-Horses.  At daybreak, having met no one, we hid our horses and\nclimbed to the top of the nearest butte to take an observation.  It\nwas a very hot day.  We lay flat on our blankets, facing the west\nwhere the cliff fell off in a sheer descent, and with our backs\ntoward the more gradual slope dotted with scrub pines and cedars. \nWe stuck some tall grass on our heads and proceeded to study the\nlandscape spread before us for any sign of man.",
        "“The sweeping valleys were dotted with herds, both large and\nsmall, of buffalo and elk, and now and then we caught a glimpse of\na coyote slinking into the gulches, returning from night hunting to\nsleep.  While intently watching some moving body at a distance, we\ncould not yet tell whether of men or animals, I heard a faint noise\nbehind me and slowly turned my head.  Behold! a grizzly bear\nsneaking up on all fours and almost ready to spring!",
        "“’Run!’ I yelled into the ear of my companion, and we both\nleaped to our feet in a second.  ’Separate! separate!’ he shouted,\nand as we did so, the bear chose me for his meat.  I ran downhill\nas fast as I could, but he was gaining.  ’Dodge around a tree!’\nscreamed Young-Man-Afraid.  I took a deep breath and made a last\nspurt, desperately circling the first tree I came to.  As the\nground was steep just there, I turned a somersault one way and the\nbear the other.  I picked myself up in time to climb the tree, and\nwas fairly out of reach when he gathered himself together and came\nat me more furiously than ever, holding in one paw the shreds of my\nbreechcloth, for in the fall he had just scratched my back and cut\nmy belt in two, and carried off my only garment for a trophy!",
        "“My friend was well up another tree and laughing heartily at\nmy predicament, and when the bear saw that he could not get at\neither of us he reluctantly departed, after I had politely\naddressed him and promised to make an offering to his spirit on my\nsafe return.  I don’t think I ever had a narrower escape,” he\nconcluded.",
        "During the troublous times from 1865 to 1877, American Horse\nadvocated yielding to the government at any cost, being no doubt\nconvinced of the uselessness of resistance.  He was not a\nrecognized leader until 1876, when he took the name and place of\nhis uncle.  Up to this time he bore the nickname of Manishnee (Can\nnot walk, or Played out.)",
        "When the greater part of the Ogallalas, to which band he\nbelonged, came into the reservation, he at once allied himself with\nthe peace element at the Red Cloud agency, near Fort Robinson,\nNebraska, and took no small part in keeping the young braves quiet. \nSince the older and better-known chiefs, with the exception of\nSpotted Tail, were believed to be hostile at heart, the military\nmade much use of him.  Many of his young men enlisted as scouts by\nhis advice, and even he himself entered the service.",
        "In the early part of the year 1876, there was a rumor that\ncertain bands were in danger of breaking away.  Their leader was\none Sioux Jim, so nicknamed by the soldiers.  American Horse went\nto him as peacemaker, but was told he was a woman and no brave.  He\nreturned to his own camp and told his men that Sioux Jim meant\nmischief, and in order to prevent another calamity to the tribe, he\nmust be chastised.  He again approached the warlike Jim with\nseveral warriors at his back.  The recalcitrant came out, gun in\nhand, but the wily chief was too quick for him.  He shot and\nwounded the rebel, whereupon one of his men came forward and killed\nhim.",
        "This quelled the people for the time being and up to the\nkilling of Crazy Horse.  In the crisis precipitated by this event,\nAmerican Horse was again influential and energetic in the cause of\nthe government.  From this time on he became an active participant\nin the affairs of the Teton Sioux.  He was noted for his eloquence,\nwhich was nearly always conciliatory, yet he could say very sharp\nthings of the duplicity of the whites.  He had much ease of manner\nand was a master of repartee.  I recall his saying that if you have\ngot to wear golden slippers to enter the white man’s heaven no\nIndian will ever get there, as the whites have got the Black Hills\nand with them all the gold.",
        "It was during the last struggle of his people, at the time of\nthe Messiah craze in 1890-1891 that he demonstrated as never before\nthe real greatness of the man.  While many of his friends were\ncarried away by the new thought, he held aloof from it and\ncautioned his band to do the same.  When it developed into an\nextensive upheaval among the nations he took his positive stand\nagainst it.",
        "Presently all Indians who did not dance the Ghost Dance were\nordered to come into camp at Pine Ridge agency.  American Horse was\nthe first to bring in his people.  I was there at the time and\ntalked with him daily.  When Little was arrested, it had been\nagreed among the disaffected to have him resist, which meant that\nhe would be roughly handled.  This was to be their excuse to attack\nthe Indian police, which would probably lead to a general massacre\nor outbreak.  I know that this desperate move was opposed from the\nbeginning by American Horse, and it was believed that his life was\nthreatened.",
        "On the day of the “Big Issue”, when thousands of Indians were\ngathered at the agency, this man Little, who had been in hiding,\nwalked boldly among them.  Of course the police would arrest him at\nsight, and he was led toward the guardhouse.  He struggled with\nthem, but was overpowered.  A crowd of warriors rushed to his\nrescue, and there was confusion and a general shout of “Hurry up\nwith them!  Kill them all!”  I saw American Horse walk out of the\nagent’s office and calmly face the excited mob.",
        "“What are you going to do?” he asked.  “Stop, men, stop and\nthink before you act!  Will you murder your children, your women,\nyes, destroy your nation to-day?”  He stood before them like a\nstatue and the men who held the two policemen helpless paused for\nan instant.  He went on: “You  are brave to-day because you\noutnumber the white men, but what will you do to-morrow?  There are\nrailroads on all sides of you.  The soldiers will pour in from\nevery direction by thousands and surround you.  You have little\nfood or ammunition.  It will be the end of your people.  Stop, I\nsay, stop now!”",
        "Jack Red Cloud, son of the old chief rushed up to him and\nthrust a revolver almost in his face.  “It is you and men like\nyou,” he shouted, “who have reduced our race to slavery and\nstarvation!”  American Horse did not flinch but deliberately\nreentered the office, followed by Jack still flourishing the\npistol.  But his timely appearance and eloquence had saved the day. \nOthers of the police force had time to reach the spot, and with a\nlarge crowd of friendly Indians had taken command of the situation.",
        "When I went into the office I found him alone but apparently\nquite calm.  “Where are the agent and the clerks?” I asked.  “They\nfled by the back door,” he replied, smiling.  “I think they are in\nthe cellar.  These fools outside had almost caught us asleep, but\nI think it is over now.”",
        "American Horse was one of the earliest advocates of education\nfor the Indian, and his son Samuel and nephew Robert were among the\nfirst students at Carlisle.  I think one or two of his daughters\nwere the handsomest Indian girls of full blood that I ever saw. \nHis record as a councilor of his people and his policy in the new\nsituation that confronted them was manly and consistent.",
