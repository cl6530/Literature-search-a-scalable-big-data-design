        "A crisis does not create character, but is simply its test. The young man\nwho entered the gates of No. 64 Jefferson Street at five that afternoon\nwas in all respects he who left them at a quarter before four, though he\nseemed very different to himself. He went direct to his own room and did\nnot descend until the supper bell sounded–that funny little old jangling\nbell he and Del had striven to have abolished in the interests of\nfashionable progress, until they learned that in many of the best English\nhouses it is a custom as sacredly part of the ghostly British\nConstitution as the bathless bath of the basin, as the jokeless joke of\nthe pun, as the entertainment that entertains not, as the ruler that\nrules not and the freedom that frees not. When he appeared in the\ndining-room door, his mother and Del were already seated. His mother, her\nwhite face a shade whiter, said: “I expect you’d better sit–there.” She\nneither pointed nor looked, but they understood that she meant Hiram’s\nplace. It was her formal announcement of her forgiveness and of her\nrecognition of the new head of the family. With that in his face that\ngave Adelaide a sense of the ending of a tension within her, he seated\nhimself where his father had always sat.",
        "It was a silent supper, each one absorbed in thoughts which could not\nhave been uttered, no one able to find any subject that would not make\noverwhelming the awful sense of the one that was not there and never\nagain would be. Mrs. Ranger spoke once. “How did you find Janet?” she\nsaid to Arthur.",
        "His face grew red, with gray underneath. After a pause he answered:\n“Very well.” Another pause, then: “Our engagement is broken off.”",
        "Mrs. Ranger winced and shrank. She knew how her question and the effort\nof that answer must have hurt the boy; but she did not make matters worse\nwith words. Indeed, she would have been unable to say anything, for\nsympathy would have been hypocritical, and hypocrisy was with her\nimpossible. She thought Arthur loved Janet; she realized, too, the savage\nwound to his pride in losing her just at this time. But she had never\nliked her, and now felt justified in that secret and, so she had often\nreproached herself, unreasonable dislike; and she proceeded to hate her,\nthe first time she had ever hated anybody–to hate her as a mother can\nhate one who has made her child suffer.",
        "After supper, Mrs. Ranger plunged into the household duties that were\nsaving her from insanity. Adelaide and Arthur went to the side veranda.\nWhen Arthur had lighted a cigarette, he looked at it with a grim\nsmile–it was astonishing how much stronger and manlier his face was, all\nin a few hours. “I’m on my last thousand of these,” said he. “After them,\nno more cigarettes.”",
        "“Oh, it isn’t so bad as all that!” said Adelaide. “We’re still\ncomfortable, and long before you could feel any change, you’ll be making\nplenty of money.”",
        "“I’m going to work–next Monday–at the mills.”",
        "Adelaide caught her breath, beamed on him. “I knew you would!” she\nexclaimed. “I knew you were brave.”",
        "“Brave!” He laughed disagreeably. “Like the fellow that faces the fight\nbecause a bayonet’s pricking his back. I can’t go away somewhere and get\na job, for there’s nothing I can do. I’ve got to stay right here. I’ve\ngot to stare this town out of countenance. I’ve got to get it used to the\nidea of me as a common workingman with overalls and a dinner pail.”",
        "She saw beneath his attempt to make light of the situation a deep and\ncruel humiliation. He was looking forward to the keenest torture to which\na man trained in vanity to false ideals can be subjected; and the thing\nitself, so Adelaide was thinking, would be more cruel than his writhing\nanticipation of it.",
        "“Still,” she insisted to him, “you are brave. You might have borrowed of\nmother and gone off to make one failure after another in gentlemanly\nattempts. You might have\"–she was going to say, “tried to make a rich\nmarriage,” but stopped herself in time. “Oh, I forgot,” she said,\ninstead, “there’s the five thousand dollars. Why not spend it in studying\nlaw–or something?”",
        "“I’ve lost my five thousand,” he replied. “I paid it for a lesson that\nwas cheap at the price.” Then, thoughtfully, “I’ve dropped out of the\nclass ’gentleman’ for good and all.”",
        "“Or into it,” suggested she.",
        "He disregarded this; he knew it was an insincerity–one of the many he\nand Del were now trying to make themselves believe against the almost\nhopeless handicap of the unbelief they had acquired as part of their\n“Eastern culture.” He went on: “There’s one redeeming feature of the–the\nsituation.”",
        "“Only one?”",
        "“And that for you,” he said. “At least, you’ve got a small income.”",
        "“But I haven’t,” she replied. “Dory made me turn it over to mother.”",
        "Arthur stared. “Dory!”",
        "“Yes,” she answered, with a nod and a smile. It would have given Dory a\nsurprise, a vastly different notion as to what she thought of him, had he\nseen her unawares just then.",
        "“Made you?”",
        "“Made,” she repeated.",
        "“And you did it?”",
        "“I’ve promised I will.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“I don’t just know,” was her slow reply.",
        "“Because he was afraid it might make bad blood between you and me?”",
        "“That was one of the reasons he urged,” she admitted. “But he thought,\ntoo, it would be bad for him and me.”",
        "A long silence. Then Arthur: “Del, I almost think you’re not making such\na mistake as I feared, in marrying him.”",
        "“So do I–sometimes,” was his sister’s, to him, astonishing answer, in an\nabsent, speculative tone.",
        "Arthur withheld the question that was on his lips. He looked curiously at\nthe small graceful head, barely visible in the deepening twilight. “She’s\na strange one,” he reflected. “I don’t understand her–and I doubt if she\nunderstands herself.”",
        "And that last was very near to the truth. Everyone has a reason for\neverything he does; but it by no means follows that he always knows\nthat reason, or even could extricate it from the tangle of motives,\nreal and reputed, behind any given act. This self-ignorance is less\ncommon among men than among women, with their deliberate training to\nself-consciousness and to duplicity; it is most common among those–men\nas well as women–who think about themselves chiefly. And Adelaide,\nhaving little to think about when all her thinking was hired out, had of\nnecessity thought chiefly about herself.",
        "“You guessed that Janet has thrown me over?” Arthur said, to open the way\nfor relieving his mind.",
        "Adelaide made a gallant effort, and her desire to console him conquered\nher vanity. “Just as Ross threw me over,” she replied, with a successful\nimitation of indifference.",
        "Instead of being astonished at the news, Arthur was astonished at his not\nhaving guessed it. His first sensation was the very human one of\npleasure–the feeling that he had companionship in humiliation. He moved\ncloser to her. Then came an instinct, perhaps true, perhaps false, that\nshe was suffering, that Ross had wounded her cruelly, that she was not so\ncalm as her slim, erect figure seemed in the deep dusk. He burst out in\nquiet, intense fury: “Del, I’ll make those two wish to God they hadn’t!”",
        "“You can’t do it, Artie,” she replied. “The only power on earth that can\ndo them up is themselves.” She paused to vent the laugh that was as\nnatural in the circumstances as it was unpleasant to hear. “And I think\nthey’ll do it,” she went on, “without any effort on your part–or mine.”",
        "“You do not hate them as I do,” said he.",
        "“I’m afraid I’m not a good hater,” she answered. “I admit I’ve got a sore\nspot where he–struck me. But as far as he’s concerned, I honestly\nbelieve I’m already feeling a little bit obliged to him.”",
        "“Naturally,” said he in a tone that solicited confidences. “Haven’t you\ngot what you really wanted?”",
        "But his sister made no reply.",
        "“Look here, Del,” he said after waiting in vain, “if you don’t want to\nmarry, there’s no reason why you should. You’ll soon see I’m not as\ngood-for-nothing as some people imagine.”",
        "“What makes you think I don’t want to marry?” asked Adelaide, her face\ncompletely hid by the darkness, her voice betraying nothing.",
        "“Why, what you’ve been saying–or, rather, what you’ve not been\nsaying.”",
        "A very long silence, then out of the darkness came Adelaide’s voice,\neven, but puzzling. “Well, Artie, I’ve made up my mind to marry. I’ve got\nto do something, and Dory’ll give me something to do. If I sat about\nwaiting, waiting, and thinking, thinking, I should do–something\ndesperate. I’ve got to get away from myself. I’ve got to forget myself.\nI’ve got to get a new self.”",
        "“Just as I have,” said Arthur.",
        "Presently he sat on the arm of her chair and reached out for her hand\nwhich was seeking his.",
        "When Hiram was first stricken, Adelaide’s Simeon had installed himself as\nattendant-in-chief. The others took turns at nursing; Simeon was on duty\nevery hour of every twenty-four. He lost all interest in Adelaide, in\neverything except the sick man. Most of the time he sat quietly, gazing\nat the huge, helpless object of his admiration as if fascinated. Whenever\nHiram deigned to look at him, he chattered softly, timidly approached,\nretreated, went through all his tricks, watching the while for some sign\nof approval. The first week or so, Hiram simply tolerated the pathetic\nremembrancer to human humility because he did not wish to chagrin his\ndaughter. But it is not in nature to resist a suit so meek, so\npersistent, and so unasking as Simeon’s. Soon Hiram liked to have his\nadorer on his knee, on the arm of his chair, on the table beside him;\noccasionally he moved his unsteady hand slowly to Simeon’s head to give\nit a pat. And in the long night hours of wakefulness there came to be a\nsoothing companionship in the sound of Simeon’s gentle breathing in the\nlittle bed at the head of his bed; for Simeon would sleep nowhere else.",
        "The shy races of mankind, those that hide their affections and rarely\ngive them expression, are fondest of domestic animals, because to them\nthey can show themselves without fear of being laughed at or repulsed.\nBut it happened that Hiram had never formed a friendship with a dog. In\nhis sickness and loneliness, he was soon accepting and returning Simeon’s\nfondness in kind. And at the time when a man must re-value everything in\nlife and put a proper estimate upon it, this unselfish, incessant, wholly\ndisinterested love of poor Simeon’s gave him keen pleasure and content.\nAfter the stroke that entombed him, some subtle instinct seemed to guide\nSimeon when to sit and sympathize at a distance, when to approach and\ngive a gentle caress, with tears running from his eyes. But the death\nSimeon did not understand at all. Those who came to make the last\narrangements excited him to fury. Adelaide had to lock him in her\ndressing room until the funeral was over. When she released him, he flew\nto the room where he had been accustomed to sit with his great and good\nfriend. No Hiram! He ran from room to room, chattering wildly, made the\ntour of gardens and outbuildings, returned to the room in which his quest\nhad started. He seemed dumb with despair. He had always looked\nludicrously old and shriveled; his appearance now became tragic. He would\nstart up from hours of trancelike motionlessness, would make a tour of\nhouse and grounds; scrambling and shambling from place to place;\nchattering at doors he could not open, then pausing to listen; racing to\nthe front fence and leaping to its top to crane up and down the street;\nalways back in the old room in a few minutes, to resume his watch and\nwait. He would let no one but Adelaide touch him, and he merely endured\nher; good and loving though she seemed to be, he felt that she was\nsomehow responsible for the mysterious vanishing of his god while she had\nhim shut away.",
        "Sometimes in the dead of night, Adelaide or Arthur or Mrs. Ranger,\nwaking, would hear him hurrying softly, like a ghost, along the halls or\nup and down the stairs. They, with the crowding interests that compel the\nmind, no matter how fiercely the bereaved heart may fight against\nintrusion, would forget for an hour now and then the cause of the black\nshadow over them and all the house and all the world; and as the weeks\npassed their grief softened and their memories of the dead man began to\ngive them that consoling illusion of his real presence. But not Simeon;\nhe could think only that his friend had been there and was gone.",
        "At last the truth in some form must have come to him. For he gave up the\nsearch and the hope, and lay down to die. Food he would not touch; he\nneither moved nor made a sound. When Adelaide took him up, he lifted dim\ntragic eyes to her for an instant, then sank back as if asleep. One\nmorning, they found him in Hiram’s great arm chair, huddled in its\ndepths, his head upon his knees, his hairy hands stiff against his\ncheeks. They buried him in the clump of lilac bushes of which Hiram had\nbeen especially fond.",
        "Stronger than any other one influence for good upon Adelaide and Arthur\nat that critical time, was this object lesson Simeon gave–Simeon with\nhis single-hearted sorrow and single-minded love.",
