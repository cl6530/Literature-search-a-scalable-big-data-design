        "My last Letter introduced the Soofies to your notice, the present shall\nconvey a further account of some of these remarkable characters who have\nobtained so great celebrity among the Mussulmauns of India, as to form the\nsubjects of daily conversation. I have heard some rigid Mussulmauns\ndeclare they discredit the mysterious knowledge a Soofie is said to\npossess, yet the same persons confess themselves staggered by the singular\ncircumstances attending the practice of Soofies living in their vicinity,\nwhich they have either witnessed or heard related by men whose veracity\nthey cannot doubt; amongst the number I may quote an intimate acquaintance\nof my husband’s, a very venerable Syaad of Lucknow, who relates an\nanecdote of Saalik Soofies, which I will here introduce.",
        "’Meer Eloy Bauxh,[1] a Mussulmaun of distinguished piety, who has devoted\na long life to the service of God, and in doing good to his fellow-men,\ntells me, that being curious to witness the effect of an assembly of\nSaalik Soofies, he went with a party of friends, all equally disposed with\nhimself to be amused by the eccentricities of the Soofies, whose practice\nthey ridiculed as at least absurd,–to speak in no harsher terms of their\npretended supernatural gifts.",
        "’This assembly consisted of more than a hundred persons, who by agreement\nmet at a large hall in the city of Lucknow, for the purpose of\n“remembering the period of absence”, as they term the death of a highly\nrevered Soofie of their particular class. The room being large, and free\nadmittance allowed to all persons choosing to attend the assembly, Meer\nEloy Bauxh and his party entered, and seated themselves in a convenient\nplace for the more strict scrutiny of the passing-scene.",
        "’The service for the occasion began with a solemn strain by the musical\nperformers, when one of the inspired Soofies commenced singing in a voice\nof remarkable melody. The subject was a hymn of praise to the great\nCreator, most impressively composed in the Persian language. Whilst the\nSoofie was singing, one of the elders in particular,–though all seemed\nsensibly affected by the strain,–rose from his seat, in what the Soofies\nthemselves call, “the condition changed,” which signifies, by what I could\nlearn, a religious ecstasy. This person joined in the same melody which\nthe other Soofie had begun, and at the same time accompanied the music by\ncapering and sobbing in the wildest manner imaginable. His example had the\neffect of exciting all the Soofies on whom his eyes were cast to rise also\nand join him in the hymn and dance.",
        "’The singularity of this scene seemed, to Meer Eloy Bauxh and his party,\nso ludicrous that they could not refrain from laughing in an audible\nmanner, which attracted the attention of the principal Soofie engaged in\nthe dance, who cast his eyes upon the merry party, not, however,\napparently in anger. Strange as he confesses it to be,–and even now it\nseems more like a dream than a reality,–at the moment he met the eye of\nthe Soofie, there was an instant glow of pure happiness on his heart, a\nsensation of fervent love to God, which he had never before felt, in his\nmost devout moments of prayer and praise; his companions were similarly\naffected, their eyes filled with tears, their very souls seemed elevated\nfrom earth to heaven in the rapture of their songs of adoration, which\nburst forth from their lips in unison with the whole Soofie assemblage.",
        "’Before they had finished their song of praise, which lasted a\nconsiderable time, the chief of the Soofie party sunk exhausted on the\ncarpet, whilst the extraordinary display of devotion continued in full\nforce on the whole assembly, whether Soofies or mere visitors, for many\nminutes after the principal devotee had fallen to the floor. Water was\nthen procured, and animation gradually returned to the poor exhausted\ndevotee, but with considerable delay. Meer Eloy Bauxh says he waited until\nthe Soofie was perfectly restored to sense, and saw him taken to his place\nof abode; he then returned to his own home to meditate on the events of a\nday he never can forget.’",
        "Soofeism, it appears, (by the accounts I have received,) is a mystery; the\nsecret of which can only be imparted by the professor to such persons as\nhave been prepared for its reception, by a course of religious instruction.\nNo one can be initiated into the mystery who has not first renounced all\nworldly vanities and ambitious projects–who is not sincerely repentant of\npast offences–who has not acquired perfect humility of heart, and an\nentire resignation to the Divine Will–a lively faith in God, and a firm\ndetermination to love and serve Him, from a conviction, ’That God alone is\nworthy to be served, loved, and worshipped by His creatures.’ Thus\nprepared, the person is to receive instruction from a Calipha, (head or\nleader of the Soofies), who directs the pupil in certain exercises of the\nheart, which constitute the secrets of their profession. What these\nexercises are, I am not competent to give an opinion, but judging by the\nway a real Soofie conducts himself, it may be presumed his practices are\npurely religious; for I am assured that he is devoted to all good ways;\nthat he carefully avoids worldly vanities, and every species of temptation\nand alluring gratification of the senses; that he is incessant in prayer,\nand in fasting severe; free from all prejudice, as regards the belief or\npersuasion of other men, so long as they worship God alone; regarding all\nmankind as brothers, himself the humblest of the race; claiming no merit\nfor the ascendancy he has acquired over earthly wishes, he gives glory\nalone to God, whom he loves and worships.",
        "All the Durweish are of the Mussulmaun persuasion. Many are devout\nDurweish, who are, nevertheless, unacquainted with the mystery of Soofeism;\nand, to use their own words, (by which the Natives distinguish them),\n’Every real Soofie is undoubtedly a Durweish, but all Durweishes are not\nSoofies,’ although their lives may be devoted much in the same holy way,\nboth in the practice of religion and abstinence from worldly enjoyments;\nand if the writers on these subjects may be believed, many wonderful cures\nhave been effected by the prayers of the devout Durweish.",
        "There are some pretenders, I am told, who put themselves forth to the\nworld in the character of a Durweish, who are not, in fact, entitled to\nthe appellation,–hypocritical devotees, who wear the outward garb of\nhumility, without the feeling of that inward virtue which is the\ncharacteristic principle of the true Durweish. The distinction between the\nreal and the pretended Durweish, may be illustrated by the following\nanecdote which I have received from the mouth of Meer Hadjee Shaah:–",
        "’In the last century,’ he says, ’there lived at or near Delhi, a very\npure-minded Durweish, named Shah Sherif ood deen Mah-mood,[2] (he was\nknown in his latter years by several of my aged acquaintance at Lucknow,\nand his son and grandson both lived, at different periods, in that city).\nThis person forsook the world whilst in the prime of manhood, and devoted\nhimself to prayer, fasting, and good deeds. He was esteemed the most\nhumble-minded of human beings, and his devotion to his Maker sincere and\nardent. His principal abode was Delhi, where his wife and children also\nresided, to whom he was tenderly attached; yet so tempered were his\naffections, that he never allowed any earthly endearments to interfere\nwith his devotions, or to separate him from his love to his Creator.",
        "’It was announced by the Soofies and Durweish, that on a certain day a\nfestival or assembly of holy men would meet for the service of God, at the\nJummah musjud[3] (Friday mosque), situated in the city of Delhi.",
        "’Shah Sherif ood deen was disposed to attend the meeting, which consisted\nof the heads or superiors of several classes of the religious, with their\ndisciples and followers. At this meeting, as was expected, were assembled\nthe Soofies, Durweish, and religious mendicants of all ranks and\nconditions, from those clothed in gold-cloth and brocade, down to the\nalmost naked Faakeer;[4] and amongst the latter number may be classed the\nhumble-minded Shah Sherif ood deen. A small wrapper girt about his loins\nby a girdle of black wool spun into small ropes, and a similar article\nwound round his head, with a coarse white sheet over his shoulders for his\nsummer apparel; and a black blanket to shelter his naked limbs from the\ncold winter, formed his sole wardrobe.",
        "’This holy man took his station in the most humble spot of the assembly,\n“sitting amongst the shoes” of the more esteemed or more aspiring\npersonages. As there was nothing remarkable in his appearance, he remained\nunobserved, or unnoticed by the multitude present. Many of the assembly\nmade great display of their right to pre-eminence, by the costliness of\ntheir robes, the splendour of their equipage, and the number of their\nservants; striving to command respect, if possible, by their superior\nexternal habiliments.",
        "’This meeting had been convened to celebrate the death of one of their\norder, which had occurred some years prior. After prayers had been read,\nsuited to the occasion, a poor man, whose very appearance might excite\ncompassion, addressed the heads of the devotees with folded hands,\nbeseeching them, who were accounted so truly holy in their lives, to offer\nup a prayer for him who had so long suffered severe affliction, by reason\nof his neck and face being drawn awry, from a paralytic attack, or some\nlike calamity. The sufferer said, “I am a poor merchant, and have a large\nfamily dependant altogether on my personal exertions for support; but,\nalas! this illness prevents me from attending to the business of life. I\nam wasting both in body and in substance through this grievous affliction.”",
        "’The sick man’s address was heard by the whole assembly in silence; many\npresent, both Soofies and Durweish, were really pious men, and were\nwilling to allow the person who seemed to be the head of this assembly, to\nintercede in behalf of the sufferer. To him they all looked, expecting he\nwould commence a prayer in which they might join; but he, it is suspected,\nconscious of his own duplicity in assuming only the character of a Soofie\nwithout the virtues, was anxious to dismiss the supplicant, with a promise\nthat prayer should certainly be made for him in private, adding, “This is\nnot a proper season for your application; it is disrespectful to disturb\nour meeting with your requests; we came not here to listen to your\nimportunities, but on more important, business.”",
        "’\"True, my Lord,” answered the afflicted man; “I am sensible of all you\nsay; but, I do assure you, private prayer has been tried for my relief by\nmany individuals of your holy profession, and I have still to mourn my\ncalamity. I thought when so many holy persons were assembled together, the\nunited prayer–in accordance with our Prophet’s commands–offered up at\nthis time, would certainly be received at the throne of Mercy. I entreat\nthen, at the hands of this venerable assembly, the aid I require.”",
        "’The pretended Soofie looked haughtily on the sick man, and bade him\nretire to his home; he should have a prayer offered, he might depend, but\nit must be in private. The sufferer was still importunate, and urged every\nargument he could command, to induce the inexorable Soofie to allow the\npresent assembly to offer a prayer on the spot for his recovery; but\nnothing he could urge availed with the proud Soofie, who at length grew\nangry even to the use of bitter words.",
        "’Shah Sherif ood deen observed in silence the scene before him; at length\nhe ventured (in the most respectful terms) to suggest to the heads of the\nassembly the propriety of vouchsafing the poor man’s request; and hinted\nthat, the prayer of some one more pure of heart than the rest might\neffectually reach the throne of Mercy in behalf of the supplicant.",
        "’\"And pray,” said the leader, rising haughtily, “who gave you leave to\nsuggest or recommend to your superiors in knowledge and virtue? Is not our\ndetermination sufficient, that you, insignificant being! should presume to\nteach us what we ought to do?–you can know nothing of the Durweish’s\npowerful prayers, nor the mystery of a Soofie’s holy calling.”",
        "’\"I am, indeed, a very ignorant and unworthy creature,” replied Shah\nSherif, “and acknowledge my great presumption in daring to speak before so\nmany of my superiors in knowledge and virtue; but we are told in our\nhudeeths (true speech) that the prayers of many hearts may prevail in a\ngood cause, whilst singly offered the same prayer might fail,” The proud\nSoofie’s anger seemed to increase as the Durweish spoke; he bade him keep\nsilence, and reviled him with many bitter words, which the good Shah\nreceived with his usual humility and forbearance. At length, the Shah\nlooked attentively at the Soofie, who had thus rebuked and insulted him,\nand said, “I will believe, Sir, you are the Soofie you aspire to be\nthought among your fellow-men, if you will immediately offer up your\nsingle prayer, by which the suffering man may be relieved; for we know\nsuch prayers have been answered by the gracious Giver of all good.”",
        "’\"What do you know of the powerful prayer of the Soofie?” replied the\nproud man, “I suspect you to be an impostor in your humble exterior.\"–\"No,\n“ said the Shah, “I am but a poor beggar, and a humble, the very humblest\nservant of God.\"–\"You pretend to much humility,” retorted the Soofie,\n“suppose we see one of your miraculous works in answer to your prayer; it\nwould please us to witness what you can do.”",
        "’Shah Sherif ood deen raised his eyes to Heaven, his heart went with his\nprayer, and in a dignified manner he stretched forth his hand towards the\nafflicted person. The man was instantly restored; then drawing his hand\ninto a direct line with the proud Soofie, and pointing his finger to him,\nhe said, “What more, friend, dost them now require of me? The man’s\naffliction is removed, but the power which is delegated to me rests still\non my finger; command me, to whom shall I present it; to you, or any one\nof your people?”",
        "’The proud Soofie hung his head abashed and confounded, he had not power\nto answer. The Shah observed his confusion and said, “It is not well to\npray for relief to one poor weak fellow-creature, and then to afflict\nanother; to the mountain’s retreat, I will consign this malady.” Then\nshaking his hand as if to relieve himself from a heavy weight, he uttered\nin a solemn tone, “Go to the mountains!” and resumed that humble seat he\nhad first chosen with a smile of composure beaming on his countenance.’\nThis miracle is actually believed by the Natives to be true.",
        "Shah Sherif ood deen, say the people who know him, spent the principal\npart of each day and night in silent prayer and meditation; no one ever\nventured to intrude within his small sanctuary, but hundreds of people\nwould assemble outside the building, in front of which he occasionally sat\nfor an hour, but scarcely ever conversed with any one of his visitors.\nDuring the time he was thus seated, he generally raised his eyes once or\ntwice, and looked round on the faces of his audience. It was generally\nremarked, that no one could meet the eye of Shah Jee–that familiar\nappellation by which he was known–without an indescribable sensation of\nreverential awe, which irresistibly compelled them to withdraw their eyes.\nThe talismanic power of Shah Jee’s eyes had become proverbial throughout\nthe city of Delhi. A certain Pattaan,[5] however, of warlike appearance, a\nman remarkable for his bravery, declared amongst his associates that he\nwould certainly out-stare Shah Jee, if ever they met, which he was\nresolved should be the very first opportunity; he accordingly went with\nhis companions at a time when this Durweish was expected to appear in\npublic.",
        "The Pattaan was seated on the floor with many other people; when the Shah\nissued from his sanctuary, the people rose to make their salaams, which\nShah Jee either did not, or would not observe, but seated himself\naccording to his custom on the mat which had been spread for him; where,\nhis eyes fixed on the ground, he seemed for some time to be wholly\nabsorbed in silent meditation. At length, raising his head, he turned his\nface to the long line of spectators, saluting with his eyes each person in\nthe row, until he came to the Pattaan, who, according to his vow, kept his\nlarge eyes fixed on the Durweish. Shah Jee went on with his survey, and a\nsecond time cast a glance along the whole line, not omitting the Pattaan\nas before, whose gaze, his companions observed, was as firmly settled on\nthe Durweish as at the first. A third time the eyes of the Shah went round\nthe assembly and rested again on the Pattaan.",
        "Observing the immoveable eyes of their Pattaan acquaintance, the visitors\nsmiled at each other, and secretly gave him credit for a piety and\npureness of heart which he was not before supposed to be blessed with;\n’How else,’ said they, ’would he have been able to withstand the\npenetrating glance of the revered Durweish.’ Shah Jee rose from his seat,\nand retired, thus giving to the company a signal for their departure from\nthe place.",
        "The associates of the Pattaan congratulated him on his success, and\ninquired by what stratagem he had so well succeeded in fulfilling his\npromise; but his eyes being still fixed in a wild stare, he replied not to\nhis questioners. They rallied him, and tried by a variety of means to\ndissolve his reverie; but the Pattaan was insensible, all the boasted\nenergies of his mind having forsaken him. His friends were now alarmed at\nhis abstractedness, and with considerable difficulty removed him from the\nplace to his own home, where his family received him, for the first time,\nwith grief, as he was their whole stay and support, and the kind head of a\nlarge family.",
        "The Pattaan continued staring in the same state throughout the night and\nfollowing day, talking wildly and incoherently. ’The Pattaan is paid for\nhis presumption,’ said some; others recommended application to be made to\nthe Durweish, Shah Jee, who could alone remove the calamity. The wife and\nmother, with many female dependants, resolved on pleading his case with\nthe benevolent Shah Jee; but as access to him would be difficult, they\nconceived the idea of making their petition through the agency of the wife\nof the Durweish, to whom they accordingly went in a body at night, and\nrelated their distress, and the manner in which they supposed it to have\noriginated, declaring, in conclusion, that as the excellent Durweish had\nbeen pleased to cast this affliction on their guardian, they must become\nslaves to his family, since bread could no longer be provided by the\nlabour of him who had hitherto been their support.",
        "The wife of the Durweish comforted the women by kind words, desiring them\nto wait patiently until her dear lord could be spoken with, as she never\nventured to intrude on his privacy at an improper moment, however urgent\nthe necessity. After a few hours’ delay, passed with impatient feeling by\nthe group of petitioning females, they were at length repaid by the voice\nof Shah Jee. His wife going to the door of his apartment, told him of the\ncircumstance attending the Pattaan, and the distressed condition of the\nfemales of his family, who came to supplicate his aid in restoring their\nrelative to reason; adding, ’What commands will you be pleased to convey\nby me? What remedy do you propose for the suffering Pattaan?’",
        "The Durweish answered, ’His impure heart, then, could not withstand the\nreflected light. Well, well! tell the poor women to be comforted, and as\nthey desire to have the Pattaan restored to his former state, they need\nonly purchase some sweetmeats from the bazaar, which the man being induced\nto eat, he will speedily be restored to his wonted bodily and mental\npowers.’",
        "Upon hearing the commands of Shah Jee, the women speedily departed,\nejaculating blessings on the Durweish, his wife, and family. On their\nreturn they purchased the sweetmeats and presented them to the Pattaan,\nwho devoured them with eagerness, and immediately afterwards his former\nsenses returned, to the no small joy of his family circle. They inquired\nof him, what had been the state of his feelings during the time he was in\nthat insensible state from which he was now happily relieved? He replied,\nthat the first gaze of the Durweish had fixed his eyes so firmly that he\ncould by no means close or withdraw them from the object; the second\nglance detached his thoughts from every earthly vanity or wish; and that\nthe third look from the same holy person, fixed him in unspeakable joys,\ntransports pure and heavenly, which continued until he had eaten the\nsweetmeats they had presented, with a kind intention, he had no doubt, but\nwhich nevertheless, must be ever regretted by him whilst life remained;\nfor no earthly joy could be compared with that which he had experienced in\nhis trance.",
        "The Durweish Shah Sherif ood deen, was asked by some one why he had\nselected the bazaar sweetmeats as a remedy in the Pattaan’s case? He\nanswered, ’Because I knew the man’s heart was corrupt. The light which had\nbeen imparted to him could alone be removed by his partaking of the\ndirtiest thing mortals hold good for food, and surely there cannot be any\nthing more dirty than the bazaar sweetmeats, exposed as they are to the\nflies and dust of the city; and how filthily they are manufactured\nrequires not my aid in exposing.’",
        "This Durweish is said,–and believed by the good Mussulmaun people I have\nconversed with,–to have foreseen the hour when he should be summoned from\nthis life into eternity; and three weeks prior to the appointed time, he\nendeavoured to fortify the minds of his wife and family, to bear with\nresignation that separation he had been warned should take place. He\nassembled his affectionate relatives on the occasion, and thus addressed\nthem, ’My dear family, it is the will of God that we should part; on such\na day (mentioning the time), my soul will take flight from its earthly\nmansion. Be ye all comforted, and hereafter, if ye obey God’s holy law, ye\nshall meet me again in a blessed eternity.’",
        "As may be supposed, the females wept bitterly; they were distressed,\nbecause the good Durweish had ever been kind, indulgent, affectionate, and\ntender in all the relative situations he held amongst them. He tried many\nsoothing arguments to comfort and console them for some hours, but without\nin the least reducing their grief, or moderating their bewailings: they\ncould not, and would not be comforted.",
        "’Well,’ said the Durweish, ’since the separation I have predicted causes\nyou all so much sorrow, it would be better, perhaps, that we part not. I\nhave thought of another method to avoid the pangs of separation; I will\noffer my prayers this night to the gracious Giver of all good, that He may\nbe pleased to permit ye all to bear me company in death.’",
        "’Oh! stay your prayer!’ said the wife of the Durweish; ’this must not be;\nfor if we all die at once, who will perform the funeral rites, and deposit\nour bodies in the earth?’ The Durweish smiled at his wife’s objection, and\nanswered, ’This is of no consequence to us, dear wife: the body may be\nlikened to a garment that is thrown off when old; the soul having worn its\nearthly covering for a season, at the appointed time shakes off the\nperishable piece of corruption, to enter into a purer state of existence.\nIt matters not if the body have a burial or not; the soul takes no\ncognizance of the clay it has quitted. Yet, if it be a matter of great\nconsideration with you, be assured that many pious men and Durweish, whose\nrespect we have enjoyed in life, will not fail to give decent interment to\nthe remains of those they have loved and respected.’",
        "This for a moment baffled the wife in her argument; but presently she\npersuasively urged that her daughters were all young, that they had as yet\nseen but little of this world, and therefore it would be cruel to take\nthem away so soon; they must desire to see more of this life ere they\nentered on another state of existence. ’Oh, my wife,’ said the Durweish,\n’you reason badly; this life hath no joys to be compared with those which\nthe righteous man’s hopes lead him to expect in the world beyond the grave.\nI will assuredly make my promised prayer, if I find a semblance of\nremaining grief upon separating from me at the appointed time, for our\nremoval to perfect happiness.’",
        "’No, no!’ was cried by all the assembled family; ’do let us remain a\nlittle longer here, we are not in a hurry to quit this world.’–’Well,\nwell, be satisfied then,’ responded the Durweish, ’if such is your desire;\nand hereafter let me not hear a sigh or a murmur from one of you, for my\nappointed time is drawing to a close; if you will not accompany me, let me,\nat least, depart in peace.’",
        "The people who relate this (and I have heard the anecdote from many) add,\nthat the Durweish Shah Sherif ood deen Mah-mood died at the close of the\nthird week, and on the day and hour he had predicted.",
        "A grandson of this Durweish I have been writing about is still living in\nIndia, remarkable for a very retentive memory and propriety of life. I\nhave not met with this gentleman during my residence in India, but have\noften heard his name mentioned with respect by Meer Hadjee Shaah who knew\nhim well. He says that this Syaad, when but a boy, learned the whole\nKhoraun by heart[6] in the short space of forty days; he adds, that this\nperson is exemplary in his life, and in his habits and manners humble;\nthat he is truly a servant of God; rejects the mystic tenets of Soofieism;\npossesses an enlightened mind, and is a Moollah or Doctor of the\nMussulmaun law. I have heard many singular anecdotes of his life, proving\nhis disregard for riches, honours, and the vain pursuits of the\nworldly-minded. If I recollect right, he once was engaged in the\nconfidential office of Moonshie to a highly talented gentleman at Fort\nWilliam, from which employment he retired and took up his abode for some\ntime at Lucknow; from whence, it was said, he went to Hydrabaad, where, it\nis probable, he may still be found in the exercise of a religious course\nof life. His name is respected by all the good men of his own persuasion,\nwith whom I have been most intimately acquainted.",
        "Conceiving the subject may be interesting to my friends, I will not offer\nany apology for introducing to your notice a female character of great\nmerit, whose death occurred during my residence in the vicinity of her\nabode. I was induced to make memorandums of the circumstances which\nbrought the knowledge of her virtues more immediately before the public.",
        "Maulvee Meer Syaad Mahumud[7] succeeded, on the death of his father, in\n1822, to the exalted position amongst Mussulmauns of head leader and\nexpounder of the Mahumudan law in the city of Lucknow; he is a person of\nunassuming manners and extreme good sense, is an upright, honest-hearted,\nreligious man, meriting and receiving the respect and good opinion of all\nhis countrymen capable of appreciating the worthiness of his general\ndeportment. He is esteemed the most learned person of the present age\namongst Asiatic scholars; and occupies his time in study and devotion, and\nin giving gratuitous instruction to youth, at stated hours, in those laws\nwhich he makes his own rule of life. Neither is the good Maulvee’s fame\nconfined to the city in which he sojourns, as may be gathered from the\nfollowing anecdote, which exhibits the upright principles of this worthy\nman, at the same time that it discloses the character of a very amiable\nfemale, whose charity was as unbounded as her memory is revered in\nFurrukhabaad.",
        "’The late Nuwaub of Furrukhabaad[8] was first married to a lady of birth\nand good fortune, Villoiettee Begum,[9] by whom he was not blessed with a\nson; but he had other wives, one of whom bore him an heir, who at the\npresent time enjoys the musnud of his father.",
        "’Villoiettee Begum was beautiful in person, and possessed a heart of the\nmost benevolent and rare kind; her whole delight was centred in the\nexercises of those duties which her religion inculcated; she spent much of\nher time in prayer, in acquiring a knowledge of the Khoraun, in acts of\nkindness to her fellow-creatures, and in strict abstinence.",
        "’It was her unvaried custom at meals before she touched a morsel herself,\nto have twelve portions of food, selected from the choicest viands\nprovided for her use, set apart for as many poor people; and when they had\nbeen served, she humbly and sparingly partook of the meal before her. She\nwas possessed of great wealth, yet never expended any portion of it in the\nextravagances of dress; indeed, so humble was her appearance, that she\nmight have been mistaken for the meanest of her slaves or domestics. It\nwas her usual custom, whenever she purchased new clothing for her own wear,\nto lay in a large store for the poor; and it is affirmed, by those who\nwere long intimate with the family, that a supplicant was never known to\npass her door without relief. She even sought out, with the aid of a\nfaithful domestic, the modest poor who were restrained by their feelings\nfrom intruding their necessities; and her liberal donations were\ndistributed in so kind a manner, that even the pride of birth could never\nfeel distressed when receiving her charitable assistance.",
        "’This lady was much attached to the duties of her religion, and delighted\nin acquiring instruction from righteous persons of her own faith. She\nshowered favours on all the poor who were reported to live in the fear of\nGod; indeed, such was the liberality, benevolence, and unvaried charity of\nthis good lady, that the news of her death was received by hundreds of\npeople as their greatest earthly calamity. The example of this lady’s\ncharacter is the more enhanced by reflecting on the retired way in which\nshe was reared and lived, restrained by the customs of her people within\nthe high walls of a zeenahnah, without the advantages of a liberal\neducation or the immediate society of intelligent people. She seems, by\nall accounts, to have been a most perfect pattern of human excellence.",
        "’In forming her will (Villoiettee Begum had been a widow several years\nbefore her death), she does not appear to have wished a single thing to be\ndone towards perpetuating her name,–as is usual with the great, in\nerecting lofty domes over the deposited clay of the Mussulmaun,–but her\nimmense wealth was chiefly bequeathed in charitable gifts. The holy and\nthe humble were equally remembered in its distribution. She had been\nacquainted with the virtues of the good Maulvee of Lucknow, to whom she\nleft a handsome sum of money for his own use, and many valuable articles\nto fit up the Emaum-baarah for the service of Mahurrum, with a, desire\nthat the same should be conveyed to him as soon after her death as\nconvenient. Her vakeel (agent) wrote to Meer Syaad Mahumud very soon after\nthe lady’s death, to apprise him of the bequest Villoiettee Begum had\nwilled to him, and at the same time forwarded the portable articles to him\nat Lucknow.",
        "’The Maulvee was much surprised, and fancied there must be some mistake in\nthe person for whom this legacy was intended, as the lady herself was\nentirely unknown to him, and an inhabitant of a station so remote from his\nown residence as not likely ever to have heard of him. He, however,\nreplied to the vakeel, and wrote also to a gentleman in the neighbourhood,\ndesiring to have a strict inquiry instituted before he could venture to\naccept the riches of this lady’s bounty, presuming that even if he was the\nperson alluded to in her will, that the Begum must have intended him as\nher almoner to the poor of Lucknow. The good, upright Maulvee acted on the\nintegrity of his heart and desired a strict scrutiny might be instituted\ninto the will of the deceased, which was accordingly made, and he was\nassured in reply, that Villoiettee Begum had been long acquainted with his\nworth, and in her liberal bequest she had decidedly intended the money for\nhis sole use and benefit, in testimony of her respect for his virtuous\ncharacter. The Maulvee again wrote and requested to be informed by those\nmost intimate with the Begum’s way of life, whether she had left\nunperformed any of the duties incumbent on a member of the faithful, as\nregards zuckhaut[10], pilgrimage, the fast, &c.? which not having\naccomplished, and having ample means, he felt himself bound, in the\nsituation he held, to devote her legacy to the purpose of such duties by\nproxy (which their law commands) in her name. He was in reply assured that\nthe good Begum had not omitted any part of her duty; she had regularly\napplied zuckhaut, duly performed the fast, had paid the expenses for poor\npilgrims to Mecca (her substitutes); and not until all the scruples of the\njust Maulvec had been removed would he hear of, or accept the Begum’s\nlegacy.’",
        "The anecdote I have now given will serve to illustrate the character of\nsome good people of Hindoostaun of the present day; indeed, the veneration\nand respect paid by all classes to those men who lead religious lives, is\nbut little changed from the earlier pages of the Mussulmaun history. I\nhave just met with a Durweish anecdote, of former times, that may be worth\ntranscribing, as I have received it from Meer Hadjee Shaah, whose aid I am\nso much indebted to for subjects with which to amuse my friends.",
        "’Shaah ood Dowlah[11] was a Durweish who flourished in the reign of King\nShah Jaluui at Delhi, but whose fame is known throughout India to the\npresent day. The Durweish was remarkable for his activity of body. It is\nrelated, that he was often to be seen at prayer in Delhi, and in three\nhours after he had transported himself eighty miles oil without any\nvisible assistance but his own personal activity on foot. This\nextraordinary rapidity of movement rendered him an object of veneration;\nand the general belief was, that he was highly favoured of Heaven, and\ngifted with supernatural power; the life he led was purely religious, with\na total disregard of earthly riches.",
        "’The King, Shah Jahan, was a very sensible person, and a great admirer of\nall that is counted good and excellent in his fellow-men; he was\nparticularly friendly to such men as the Durweish, or others who devoted\ntheir lives to religious exercises. He had often heard of Shah ood Dowlah,\nwithout ever meeting with him, and on hearing of some singular acts of\nthis Durweish, he was desirous of seeing him, and gave orders accordingly\nto his Minister, that messengers should be sent in search of the holy man,\nbut as often as they appeared before the Durweish’s hut he was invisible;\nthis statement even added to the King’s curiosity. On a certain day the\nKing was seated on the story of his palace which overlooked the town and\nthe outskirts beyond the walls, in conversation with his Minister and\nfavourites, when the Durweish was espied at no great distance standing on\nthe broadway; which, when the King knew, he desired messengers might be\ndispatched to convey the holy man to his presence. “Your royal will shall\nbe obeyed”, replied the Minister; “but your Majesty must be aware that the\nextent of the circuit from the palace to the outer gate is so great that\nlong before a slave can get to that road, Shah ood Dowlah will be beyond\nthe reach of our summons. With all due submission to your Majesty’s better\njudgement, would it not be more prudent to call him from hence, and\npersuade him to ascend the wall in a basket suspended to a rope.” The King\nagreed, and the Durweish was hailed. “Our King, the Protector of the World,\ncommands Shah ood Dowlah’s attendance?\"–The Durweish, looking up at the\nsummoner, inquired, “Where is the King?\"–\"In this apartment,” he was\nanswered.–\"How am I to get near him? he is too far off: an old man does\nnot well to climb.\"–\"Wait a minute”, replied the servant, “your\nconveyance shall be prepared.”",
        "’In a few minutes the basket descended from the upper story, by a strong\nrope, well secured against the probability of accident. The Durweish,–who\nwas covered with a chudha[12], or sheet, to keep him from giddiness in the\nascent,–seated himself firmly in the basket, and the servants drew him up\nin safety. He was immediately conveyed to the King’s apartment; who,\ncontrary to precedent, rose at his entrance to receive this respected and\nmuch-desired guest.",
        "’\"Pray be seated, my friend”, said the King, leading him to the most\nhonoured part of the royal carpet. The Durweish obeyed without a moment’s\nhesitation, to the astonishment of the Vizier, nobles, courtiers, &c., who\nhad never before seen a human being seated in the King’s presence, not\neven one of the most exalted of the nobles. “I have long desired this\nhappiness,” said the King to the Durweish, “that I might converse with you.\n“–\"Your Majesty is very gracious to the poor Durweish”, was responded. “I\nhear much of your great virtue and good life,” said the King, “from the\nworld, my subjects.\"–\"They do but flatter the poor Durweish,” was his\nreply; adding, “none can tell what passes in my heart, when they view only\nmy face. I am but a poor Durweish.”",
        "’\"I have many questions to ask you,” said the King, “which I hope to have\nresolved from your own mouth; but, first, I beg to be informed, what\nmethods you have used in order to acquire that command over selfish\nfeelings, which is displayed in your intercourse with the world? and by\nwhat means you have become so enlightened in the ways pleasing to God?”",
        "’The Durweish with a smile of pleasure, and in language calm as respectful,\nanswered in the following words:–\"Your Majesty, the Protector of the\nWorld, was desirous of becoming personally known to the very meanest of\nyour subjects, the poor Durweish; the opportunity arrived, and you\ncondescended to let down a line of rope to assist your poor subject in the\nascent to your presence. With equal condescension you have seated me by\nyour side; and I, the poor Durweish, feel a due sense of the honour\nconferred on me. Had I been anxious to gain admittance to the Protector of\nthe World, many would have been the difficulties to surmount; your castle\nis well guarded, your gates innumerable to be passed ere this place could\nbe reached, and who would have aided the poor Durweish’s wishes? But your\nMajesty had the will, and the power to effect that will; whilst I, who had\nneither, might have exerted myself for ages without effect. Such then, O\nKing! is the way God draws those whom He wills unto Him. He sees into the\nhidden recesses of the human heart, and knows every working of mortal\nminds; He has no difficulty to surmount; for to whom in His mercy He\ngrants evidence of His love, He draws them to Himself in heart, in soul,\nin mind, with infinitely less effort than thou hast exerted to draw my\nmortal body within thy palace. It is God who in love and mercy throws the\nline to man; happy that soul who accepts the offered means, by which he\nmay ascend!\"’",
        "Meer Nizaam ood deen[13] lived many years at Lucknow, where he was much\nesteemed by the religious men of the time; some who survived him have\nfrequently entertained me with anecdotes of that respected Durweish. Out\nof the many I have heard detailed by them, I have selected for this place\na few of the most interesting:–",
        "A certain King of Delhi (whose name has escaped my recollection) having\nheard of the remarkable piety of this Durweish, expressed a great desire\nto see him, and the message was conveyed by a confidential person,\ninstructed to say to the holy man, that his presence was solicited as a\nfavour at Court. The person intrusted with the royal message, remarked to\nMeer Nizaam, when he had agreed to accompany him, that his mean apparel\nwas not suited to appear in the presence of majesty, and offered to\nprovide him with a superior dress.",
        "The Durweish looked steadily in the face of the proposer, and addressed\nhim, ’Friend! know you not, that clad in these very garments you deride, I\nmake my daily prayers to Him who is the Creator and Lord of the whole\nearth, and all that therein is? If I am not ashamed to appear in the\npresence of my God thus habited, canst thou think I shall deem it needful\nto change my garments for one who is, at best but the creature of my\nCreator? Thinkest thou I would pay more deference to my fellow-man than I\nhave done to my God? No, no; be assured the clothes I wear will not be\nchanged for earthly visits.’",
        "This Durweish had a mind and heart so entirely devoted to his Creator, and\nwas so thoroughly purified from earthly vanity, that his every wish was\ngranted as soon as it had been formed in his heart, says one of his many\nadmirers, Meer Eloy Bauxh[14]; who, in proof that he was so gifted, relates\nthe following anecdote which I give in his own words:–",
        "’One day I was conversing with the Durweish, Meer Nizaam, when he told me\nhe could bring me to his door, from my own home, at any hour or time he\npleased. I was a little wavering in my belief of his power to do so, and\noffered some remarks that indicated my doubts. “Well,” said he in reply,\n“you shall be convinced, my friend, ere long, I promise you.”",
        "’A few evenings after this conversation had been held, I was seated on my\ncharpoy, in meditation,–my usual practice after the evening namaaz,–when\na sudden impulse seized my mind, that I must immediately go off to the\nDurweish who lived at the opposite extremity of this large city (Lucknow).\nI prepared to set out, and by the time I was ready, the rain burst forth\nin torrents from the over-charged clouds. Still the impulse was so strong\nthat I cared not for this impediment even, which under ordinary\ncircumstances would have deterred me from venturing out on a dark evening\nof storm; I wrapped myself up in my labaadah[15], took a stick and\numbrella, and sallied forth in great haste. On reaching the outer gate of\nmy premises, the strong, feeling that had impelled me to proceed, vanished\nfrom my mind, and I was as strongly urged by an opposite impulse to retire\nagain within my own habitation, where, if I reasoned at all, it was on the\nunusual changeableness of my fixed resolution, for I never thought about\nthe subject of the Durweish’s prediction at the time.",
        "’Some few days after this, I paid Meer Nizaam a visit, and after our usual\nembrace and salutations were over, he said to me, “Well, my friend, are\nyou convinced by this time, that I have the power to bring you to me\nwhenever I wish, by the preparations you made for coming on the evening of\nsuch a day?” (mentioning the time and hour accurately).",
        "’\"I remember well my desire to visit you, but why was I deterred from my\npurpose?” I asked. The Durweish replied, “Out of pure compassion for the\nfatigue and pains it would have given you, had you come so far on such a\nnight of rain and tempest. My pity for you altered my wishes, and thereby\nyour purposes. I only wished you to be convinced, and perhaps you are so\nnow.\"’",
        "Meer Eloy Bauxh often speaks of this circumstance, and declares he has\nfull confidence that the Durweish in question possessed the power of\ninfluencing the minds of others, or attracting them by his wishes to\nappear before him.",
        "’This Durweish was once applied to by a Mussulmaun, who went regularly for\nmany days in succession, to watch a favourable moment for soliciting\nadvice and assistance in his then uneasy state of mind. The Mussulmaun’s\nname was Hummoon[16], since designated Shah, a native of the Upper\nProvinces of Hindoostaun, in the Lahore district. Hummoon occasionally\npassing near the river, had frequently observed, amongst, the number of\nHindoo women, on their way to and from the place of bathing, one young\nfemale whose charms riveted his attention. He sometimes fancied that the\ngirl smiled on him; but aware of the strong prejudices of her caste, which\nprohibits intercourse even, much less marriage, with men of another\npersuasion, he loved therefore without hope; yet he could not resist, as\nthe opportunity offered, of again and again watching for a glance at the\nbeautiful Hindoo whose person had won his entire affections. Not a word\nhad ever passed between them, but he fancied she sometimes returned his\nlooks of love in her smiles.",
        "’The passion of Hummoon increased daily; he could with difficulty restrain\nhimself within the prescribed bounds; he longed to address her, and in\nvain puzzled his imagination for the proper means to adopt, for he knew\nthe edict of her caste had placed a barrier between them of an\ninsurmountable nature. For months he endured all the torments of his\nperplexing state, and at last resolved on applying to the good Durweish\nfor advice and assistance, whose famed powers had been long the subject of\nadmiration among the Mussulmauns.",
        "Hummoon went daily to the threshold of the Durweish, and seated himself\namong the many who, like him, had some favour to ask of the holy man, at\nthe propitious moment when he chose to be visible and disposed to look\nround upon his petitioning visitors. All waited for a look with the most\nintense anxiety (for a Durweish does not always notice his courtiers), and\nhappy did he deem himself who was encouraged by the recognition of his eye,\nto offer his petition by word of mouth. Many such applicants had been\nfavoured by the Durweish, yet Hummoon visited daily without being noticed\nby the holy man. At length, however, a look of inquiry was given to the\nalmost despairing Hummoon; thus encouraged, he folded his hands, and bent\nthem forward in a supplicating attitude, told his distresses as briefly as\nthe subject would permit, and concluded his tale of sorrow, by entreating\nthe Durweish would instruct him in the exercise of some prayer by which he\nmight be made happy with the object of his love.",
        "’The Durweish listened attentively to Hummoon’s tale; and more, he pitied\nhim, for he felt at all times a due proportion of sympathy for the misery\nof his fellow-creatures, and the singularity of Hummoon’s case affected\nhim. He told him he could teach the way to become deserving of having his\nwishes in this world granted to him, but more he could not answer for; but\nit would take him a considerable time to practise the devotions necessary\nto his future peace, which were of the heart, not the mere repetition of a\nprayer by the lips. Hummoon readily assured the Durweish, he was willing\nto be guided by his advice and instruction; adding, that he would\npatiently persevere for any length of time necessary, so that at last his\nobject might be accomplished.",
        "’Hummoon commenced under the tuition of the Durweish the practice of\ndevotional exercises. He forsook (as was required of him) all vain\npursuits, worldly desires, or selfish gratifications; day and night was\ndevoted to religious study and prayer, and such was the good effect of his\nperseverance and progressive increase of faith, that at the end of some\nfew months he had entirely left off thinking of the first object of his\nadoration, his whole heart and soul being absorbed in contemplation of,\nand devotion to, his Creator. At the end of a year, no trace or\nremembrance of his old passion existed; he became a perfect Durweish,\nretired to a solitary place, where under the shade of trees he would sit\nalone for days and nights in calm composure, abstracted from every other\nthought but that of his God, to whom he was now entirely devoted.’",
        "I am told that this Durweish, Hummoon Shah, is still living\nin the Lahore province, a pattern of all that is excellent in\nvirtue and devotion.",
