        "It was about a week after Dick’s recovery of his bank-book, that\nFosdick brought home with him in the evening a copy of the “Daily\nSun.”",
        "“Would you like to see your name in print, Dick?” he asked.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, who was busy at the wash-stand, endeavoring to\nefface the marks which his day’s work had left upon his hands. “They\nhaven’t put me up for mayor, have they? ’Cause if they have, I\nshan’t accept. It would interfere too much with my private business.”",
        "“No,” said Fosdick, “they haven’t put you up for office yet, though\nthat may happen sometime. But if you want to see your name in print,\nhere it is.”",
        "Dick was rather incredulous, but, having dried his hands on the\ntowel, took the paper, and following the directions of Fosdick’s\nfinger, observed in the list of advertised letters the name of\n“RAGGED DICK.”",
        "“By gracious, so it is,” said he. “Do you s’pose it means me?”",
        "“I don’t know of any other Ragged Dick,–do you?”",
        "“No,” said Dick, reflectively; “it must be me. But I don’t know of\nanybody that would be likely to write to me.”",
        "“Perhaps it is Frank Whitney,” suggested Fosdick, after a little\nreflection. “Didn’t he promise to write to you?”",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, “and he wanted me to write to him.”",
        "“Where is he now?”",
        "“He was going to a boarding-school in Connecticut, he said. The name\nof the town was Barnton.”",
        "“Very likely the letter is from him.”",
        "“I hope it is. Frank was a tip-top boy, and he was the first that\nmade me ashamed of bein’ so ignorant and dirty.”",
        "“You had better go to the post-office to-morrow morning, and ask for\nthe letter.”",
        "“P’r’aps they won’t give it to me.”",
        "“Suppose you wear the old clothes you used to a year ago, when Frank\nfirst saw you? They won’t have any doubt of your being Ragged Dick\nthen.”",
        "“I guess I will. I’ll be sort of ashamed to be seen in ’em though,\"\nsaid Dick, who had considerable more pride in a neat personal\nappearance than when we were first introduced to him.",
        "“It will be only for one day, or one morning,” said Fosdick.",
        "“I’d do more’n that for the sake of gettin’ a letter from Frank. I’d\nlike to see him.”",
        "The next morning, in accordance with the suggestion of Fosdick, Dick\narrayed himself in the long disused Washington coat and Napoleon\npants, which he had carefully preserved, for what reason he could\nhardly explain.",
        "When fairly equipped, Dick surveyed himself in the mirror,–if the\nlittle seven-by-nine-inch looking-glass, with which the room was\nfurnished, deserved the name. The result of the survey was not on\nthe whole a pleasing one. To tell the truth, Dick was quite ashamed\nof his appearance, and, on opening the chamber-door, looked around\nto see that the coast was clear, not being willing to have any of\nhis fellow-boarders see him in his present attire.",
        "He managed to slip out into the street unobserved, and, after\nattending to two or three regular customers who came down-town\nearly in the morning, he made his way down Nassau Street to the\npost-office. He passed along until he came to a compartment on\nwhich he read ADVERTISED LETTERS, and, stepping up to the little\nwindow, said,–",
        "“There’s a letter for me. I saw it advertised in the ’Sun’\nyesterday.”",
        "“What name?” demanded the clerk.",
        "“Ragged Dick,” answered our hero.",
        "“That’s a queer name,” said the clerk, surveying him a little\ncuriously. “Are you Ragged Dick?”",
        "“If you don’t believe me, look at my clo’es,” said Dick.",
        "“That’s pretty good proof, certainly,” said the clerk, laughing. “If\nthat isn’t your name, it deserves to be.”",
        "“I believe in dressin’ up to your name,” said Dick.",
        "“Do you know any one in Barnton, Connecticut?” asked the clerk, who\nhad by this time found the letter.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick. “I know a chap that’s at boardin’-school there.”",
        "“It appears to be in a boy’s hand. I think it must be yours.”",
        "The letter was handed to Dick through the window. He received it\neagerly, and drawing back so as not to be in the way of the throng\nwho were constantly applying for letters, or slipping them into the\nboxes provided for them, hastily opened it, and began to read. As\nthe reader may be interested in the contents of the letter as well\nas Dick, we transcribe it below.",
        "It was dated Barnton, Conn., and commenced thus,–",
        "“DEAR DICK,–You must excuse my addressing this letter to ’Ragged\nDick’; but the fact is, I don’t know what your last name is, nor\nwhere you live. I am afraid there is not much chance of your getting\nthis letter; but I hope you will. I have thought of you very often,\nand wondered how you were getting along, and I should have written\nto you before if I had known where to direct.",
        "“Let me tell you a little about myself. Barnton is a very\npretty country town, only about six miles from Hartford. The\nboarding-school which I attend is under the charge of Ezekiel\nMunroe, A.M. He is a man of about fifty, a graduate of Yale College,\nand has always been a teacher. It is a large two-story house, with\nan addition containing a good many small bed-chambers for the boys.\nThere are about twenty of us, and there is one assistant teacher who\nteaches the English branches. Mr. Munroe, or Old Zeke, as we call\nhim behind his back, teaches Latin and Greek. I am studying both\nthese languages, because father wants me to go to college.",
        "“But you won’t be interested in hearing about our studies. I will\ntell you how we amuse ourselves. There are about fifty acres of land\nbelonging to Mr. Munroe; so that we have plenty of room for play.\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the house there is a good-sized pond.\nThere is a large, round-bottomed boat, which is stout and strong.\nEvery Wednesday and Saturday afternoon, when the weather is good, we\ngo out rowing on the pond. Mr. Barton, the assistant teacher, goes\nwith us, to look after us. In the summer we are allowed to go in\nbathing. In the winter there is splendid skating on the pond.",
        "“Besides this, we play ball a good deal, and we have various other\nplays. So we have a pretty good time, although we study pretty hard\ntoo. I am getting on very well in my studies. Father has not decided\nyet where he will send me to college.",
        "“I wish you were here, Dick. I should enjoy your company, and\nbesides I should like to feel that you were getting an education. I\nthink you are naturally a pretty smart boy; but I suppose, as you\nhave to earn your own living, you don’t get much chance to learn. I\nonly wish I had a few hundred dollars of my own. I would have you\ncome up here, and attend school with us. If I ever have a chance to\nhelp you in any way, you may be sure that I will.",
        "“I shall have to wind up my letter now, as I have to hand in a\ncomposition to-morrow, on the life and character of Washington. I\nmight say that I have a friend who wears a coat that once belonged\nto the general. But I suppose that coat must be worn out by this\ntime. I don’t much like writing compositions. I would a good deal\nrather write letters.",
        "“I have written a longer letter than I meant to. I hope you will get\nit, though I am afraid not. If you do, you must be sure to answer\nit, as soon as possible. You needn’t mind if your writing does look\nlike ’hens-tracks,’ as you told me once.",
        "“Good-by, Dick. You must always think of me, as your very true\nfriend,",
        "“Frank Whitney.”",
        "Dick read this letter with much satisfaction. It is always pleasant\nto be remembered, and Dick had so few friends that it was more to\nhim than to boys who are better provided. Again, he felt a new sense\nof importance in having a letter addressed to him. It was the first\nletter he had ever received. If it had been sent to him a year\nbefore, he would not have been able to read it. But now, thanks to\nFosdick’s instructions, he could not only read writing, but he could\nwrite a very good hand himself.",
        "There was one passage in the letter which pleased Dick. It was where\nFrank said that if he had the money he would pay for his education\nhimself.",
        "“He’s a tip-top feller,” said Dick. “I wish I could see him ag’in.”",
        "There were two reasons why Dick would like to have seen Frank. One\nwas, the natural pleasure he would have in meeting a friend; but he\nfelt also that he would like to have Frank witness the improvement\nhe had made in his studies and mode of life.",
        "“He’d find me a little more ’spectable than when he first saw me,\"\nthought Dick.",
        "Dick had by this time got up to Printing House Square. Standing on\nSpruce Street, near the “Tribune” office, was his old enemy, Micky\nMaguire.",
        "It has already been said that Micky felt a natural enmity towards\nthose in his own condition in life who wore better clothes than\nhimself. For the last nine months, Dick’s neat appearance had\nexcited the ire of the young Philistine. To appear in neat attire\nand with a clean face Micky felt was a piece of presumption, and an\nassumption of superiority on the part of our hero, and he termed it\n“tryin’ to be a swell.”",
        "Now his astonished eyes rested on Dick in his ancient attire, which\nwas very similar to his own. It was a moment of triumph to him. He\nfelt that “pride had had a fall,” and he could not forbear reminding\nDick of it.",
        "“Them’s nice clo’es you’ve got on,” said he, sarcastically, as Dick\ncame up.",
        "“Yes,” said Dick, promptly. “I’ve been employin’ your tailor. If my\nface was only dirty we’d be taken for twin brothers.”",
        "“So you’ve give up tryin’ to be a swell?”",
        "“Only for this partic’lar occasion,” said Dick. “I wanted to make a\nfashionable call, so I put on my regimentals.”",
        "“I don’t b’lieve you’ve got any better clo’es,” said Micky.",
        "“All right,” said Dick, “I won’t charge you nothin’ for what you\nbelieve.”",
        "Here a customer presented himself for Micky, and Dick went back to\nhis room to change his clothes, before resuming business.",
