        "At early dawn the battery arose, and, after a quick breakfast, resumed\nthe march. Some half-mile farther on they passed a battery of light\nartillery which had preceded them on the road by some nine hours, and\nwhich had camped at this point awaiting forage. At Siboney the\ndetachment stopped to look after the detail from the 13th Infantry,\nwhich had not yet reported. The detachment commander sought out the\nregimental adjutant, who referred him to the regimental commander,\nCol. Worth. This colonel was at first reluctant to allow the men to\ngo, but, on being informed of the necessity for them, and after\ninquiring about the orders on the subject, he directed the detail to\nreport immediately. All the members of this detail reported at once,\nexcept Corp. Rose, who had been left by his company commander on board\nship.",
        "The road from Siboney to the front was not known. There was no one in\ncamp who even knew its general direction. Application was therefore\nmade to Gen. Castillo, who was in command of a body of Cubans at\nSiboney, for a guide. After a great deal of gesticulation, much\nexcited talk between the general and members of his staff, and\nnumerous messengers had been dispatched hither and thither upon this\nimportant and very difficult business, a Cuban officer was sent with\ninstructions to furnish a guide who could conduct the detachment to\nGen. Wheeler’s headquarters at the front. In the course of some twenty\nminutes, a dirty slouchy, swarthy, lousy-looking vagabond was pointed\nout as the desired guide, and was said to know every by-path and trail\nbetween Siboney and Santiago. He was told to go with the detachment to\nGen. Wheeler’s headquarters and then return, and the detachment\ncommander started for his command followed by his sable guide. Passing\nthrough a group of these brave Cuban heroes, he lost sight of his\nredoubtable guide for an instant, and has never since found that\ngentleman.",
        "It would be just as well to add a description of the patriotic Cuban\nas he was found by the Gatling Gun Detachment during their campaign in\nbehalf of Cuban independence, in the name of humanity; and this\ndescription, it is thought, tallies with the experience of all\nofficers in the expedition.",
        "The valiant Cuban! He strikes you first by his color. It ranges from\nchocolate yellow through all the shades to deepest black with kinky\nhair; but you never by any chance see a white Cuban, except the fat,\nsleek, well-groomed, superbly mounted ones in “khaki,” who loaf around\nheadquarters with high-ranking shoulder-straps. These are all imported\nfrom the United States. They comprise the few wealthy ones of Spanish\ndescent, who are renegade to their own nativity, and are appealing to\nthe good people of the United States to establish them in their status\nof master of peons without any overlord who can exact his tithes for\nthe privilege.",
        "The next thing you notice is the furtive look of the thief. No one has\never yet had a chance to look one of these chocolate-colored Cubans\nstraight in the eye. They sneak along. Their gait has in it something\nof that of the Apache, the same soft moccasined tread, noiseless and\nalways stealthy. Your impressions as to their honesty can be instantly\nconfirmed. Leave anything loose, from a heavy winter overcoat, which\nno one could possibly use in Cuba, to–oh well, anything–and any\nCuban in sight will take great pleasure in dispelling any false\nimpressions that honesty is a native virtue.",
        "Next you notice that he is dirty. His wife does sometimes make a faint\nattempt at personal cleanliness; this is evident, because in one\nbright instance a white dress was seen on a native woman, that had\nbeen washed sometime in her history. But as to his lordship, the proud\nmale citizen of Cuba libre, you would utterly and bitterly insult him\nby the intimation that a man of his dignity ought ever to bathe, put\non clean clothes, or even wash his hands. He is not merely dirty, he\nis filthy. He is infested with things that crawl and creep, often\nvisibly, over his half-naked body, and he is so accustomed to it that\nhe does not even scratch.",
        "Next you observe the intense pride of this Cuban libre. It is\nmanifested the very first time you suggest anything like manual\nlabor–he is incapable of any other–even for such purposes as camp\nsanitation, carrying rations, or for any other purpose. His manly\nchest swells with pride and he exclaims in accents of wounded dignity,\n“Yo soy soldado!” Still his pride does not by any chance get him\nknowingly under fire. At El Poso some of him did get under fire from\nartillery, accidentally, and it took a strong provost guard to keep\nhim there. If he ever got under fire again there was no officer on the\nfiring-line who knew it.",
        "He is a treacherous, lying cowardly, thieving, worthless, half-breed\nmongrel; born of a mongrel spawn of Europe, crossed upon the fetiches\nof darkest Africa and aboriginal America. He is no more capable of\nself-government than the Hottentots that roam the wilds of Africa or\nthe Bushmen of Australia. He can not be trusted like the Indian, will\nnot work like a negro, and will not fight like a Spaniard; but he will\nlie like a Castilian with polished suavity, and he will stab you in\nthe dark or in the back with all the dexterity of a renegade graduate\nof Carlisle.",
        "Providence has reserved a fairer future for this noble country than to\nbe possessed by this horde of tatterdemalions. Under the impetus of\nAmerican energy and capital, governed by a firm military hand with\neven justice, it will blossom as the rose; and, in the course of three\nor four generations, even the Cuban may be brought to appreciate the\nvirtues of cleanliness, temperance, industry, and honesty.",
        "Our good roads ended at Siboney, and from there on to Gen. Wheeler’s\nheadquarters was some of the worst road ever traveled. Part of it lay\nthrough deep valleys, where the sun was visible scarcely more than an\nhour at noontime, and the wet, fetid soil was tramped into a muck of\nmalarial slime under foot of the mules and men. The jungle became\nranker, the Spanish bayonets longer and their barbs sharper in these\nlow bottom jangles. The larger undergrowth closed in more sharply on\nthe trail, and its boughs overhung so much in some places that it\nbecame necessary to cut them away with axes in order to pass.",
        "These guns were the first wheeled vehicles that had ever disturbed the\nsolitude of this portion of Cuba. The chocolate-colored natives of\nCuba sneak; the white native of Cuba, when he travels at all, goes on\nhorseback. He very seldom travels in Cuba at all, because he is not\noften there. Consequently the roads in Cuba, as a rule, are merely\nsmall paths sufficient for the native to walk along, and they carry\nthe machete in order to open a path if necessary. These low places in\nthe valleys were full of miasmatic odors, yellow fever, agues, and all\nthe ills that usually pertain to the West Indian climate.",
        "At other places the road ran along the tops of the foot-hills from one\nto two hundred feet higher than the bottom of these valleys. Here the\ncountry was much more open. The path was usually wide enough for the\nguns to move with comparative ease. Sometimes one wagon could pass\nanother easily. These parts of the road were usually more or less\nstrewn with boulders. The road was rarely level and frequently the\nupland parts were washed out. Sometimes it was only the boulder-clad\nbottom of a ravine; again the water would have washed out the gully on\none side so deep as to threaten overturning the guns. The portions of\nthe road between the valleys and the top of these foot-hills were the\nworst places the detachment had to pass. These ascents and descents\nwere nearly always steep. While not at all difficult for the man upon\nhorseback or for the man on foot, they were frequently almost too\nsteep for draft, and they were always washed out. In places it was\nnecessary to stop and fill up these washouts by shoveling earth and\nstone into the places before the detachment could pass.",
        "On one of these occasions, while heaving rock to fill up a bad\nwashout, Priv. Jones was stung by a scorpion. Jones did not know what\nhad bitten him, and described it as a little black thing about as long\nas his finger. Fortunately there was a small supply of whisky with the\ndetachment, and this remedy was applied to Jones internally. Some\nsoldier in the detachment suggested that a quid of tobacco externally\nwould be beneficial, so this also was done. It was not a dressing\nfavorable to an aseptic condition of the wound, perhaps, nor was there\nanything in the quid of tobacco calculated to withdraw the poison or\nneutralize its effects, so the doctors may characterize this as a very\nfoolish proceeding; but country people skilled in simples and herb\nremedies might tell some of these ultra scientific surgeons that the\napplication of a quid of tobacco or of a leaf of tobacco to the sting\nof a wasp or the bite of a spider, or even the sting of a scorpion, is\nnearly always attended by beneficial results. In fact, when Jones was\nstung there was a surgeon, a medical officer, who turned up even\nbefore Jones was treated with the whisky cure, and, upon receiving\nJones’ explanation that he had been heaving rock and had been bitten\non the end of the finger by a little black thing, and after hearing\nthe remarks of the men that it was very probably a scorpion sting,\nthis medical officer very sagely diagnosed the accident to that\neffect, but was unable to prescribe any remedy because he had not\nbrought along his emergency case. This medical officer, with his two\nattendant hospital satellites, had left both litter and emergency case\nupon the transport.",
        "The ordinary line officer or soldier who is somewhat accustomed to\ncarrying weights and does not require a hospital drill to teach him to\ncarry a wounded comrade a few yards, looks with a certain degree of\nenvy upon the possession of a hospital litter with its convenient\nstraps for weight-carrying, and would consider this a very convenient\nmeans for carrying a pack. This litter is designed to enable two men,\nhospital attendants or band men, to pick up a wounded soldier weighing\nsome 160 or 180 pounds and carry him from fifty yards to a mile if\nnecessary, to a dressing-station or hospital shack. The medical\nfield-case No. 1 weighs about sixty pounds filled, and field-case No.\n2 weighs about forty pounds. These two cases contain all the medicines\nnecessary to run a division hospital; the case of emergency\ninstruments does not weigh above ten or twelve pounds, and would not\nbe a burden for a child to carry. It is therefore difficult for the\nsmall-minded officer of the line to see why the Medical Department was\nunable to have these medicines up at the front. They had the same\nmeans of locomotion provided for the other soldiers, by Nature, and\nthey had, moreover, no particular necessity for all rushing to the\nextreme front. On the contrary, they had from the 23d of June, when\nthe landing began, at Baiquiri, until the 1st of July, to accomplish a\ndistance of less than twenty miles; and it would seem reasonable that\nthey might have had their medicine-cases up where they were needed by\nthat time.",
        "These gentlemen pose as the most learned, expert, scientific, highly\ntrained body of medical men in the world. They are undoubtedly as well\ntrained, as highly educated, and as thoroughly proficient as the\nmedical officers of any army in the world. A summons of an ordinary\npractitioner would bring with him his saddle-bags of medicines; no\nphysician in the city would pretend to answer even an ambulance call\nwithout having a few simple remedies–in other words, an emergency\ncase; but it was an exception, and a very rare exception at that, to\nfind a medical officer who took the trouble to carry anything upon his\naristocratic back on that march to the front.",
        "A conversation overheard between two medical officers on board a\ntransport just before landing may serve to partially explain the state\nof affairs. Said surgeon No. 1 to surgeon No. 2, “We are going to land\nthis morning; are you going to carry your field-case?” To which\nsurgeon No. 2 indignantly replied, “No, I’m not a pack-mule!” Surgeon\nNo. 1 again inquired, “Are you going to make your hospital men carry\nit?” To which surgeon No. 2 replied, “No; my men are not beasts of\nburden.” Both of these medical officers went ashore; one of them had\nhis field case carried; the other did not. Both of them were up at the\nfiring-line, both did good service in rendering first aid. Both of\nthem worked heroically, both seemed deeply touched by the suffering\nthey were compelled to witness, and both contracted the climatic\nfever. But in the absence of medicines the role of the surgeon can be\ntaken by the private soldier who has been instructed in first aid to\nthe injured; for in the absence of medical cases and surgical\ninstruments the first-aid packet is the only available source of\nrelief, and these first-aid packets were carried by the private\nsoldier, not by the Medical Department.",
        "A little less “theory,” a little less “science,” a little less\ntendency to dwell on the “officer” part of the business, with a little\nmore devotion to the duty of relieving suffering humanity–in short, a\nlittle less insistence upon “rank,” would have vastly improved the\nmedical service of the United States Army in the field at this time.",
        "These remarks do not apply to the heroes like Ebert, Thorpe, Brewer,\nKennedy, Warren, and a few others, who fearlessly exposed their lives\nupon the very firing-line. These men are the very “salt of the earth.\"\nThe escape of even a “frazzle” of the 5th Corps was due to their\nsuperhuman energy and exertions. They did much to redeem the good name\nof their corps and to alleviate suffering.",
        "But Priv. Jones recovered from the sting of the scorpion. In fact,\nsoldiers were heard to exclaim that they would be glad to find a\nscorpion when they saw the character of the remedy applied in Jones’\ncase.",
        "The detachment left Siboney about 10 o’clock in the morning and\ntramped steadily along the road up hill and down until 12; then, upon\nfinding a convenient place, it halted for dinner. The mules were\nunharnessed, coffee prepared, and, just as the detachment was about to\nbegin this noonday meal, two of the peripatetic newspaper fraternity\njoined, en route to the rear. The ubiquitous correspondent had\nfor the first time discovered the Gatling Gun Detachment, and they\nthought it was Artillery.",
        "One of these gentlemen was a long, slim, frayed-out specimen of\nhumanity, with a wearied and expressive droop of the shoulders; the\nother was a short, stout, florid, rotund individual, and his “too, too\nsolid flesh” was in the very visible act of melting. The newspaper\ngentlemen were invited to participate in the noonday meal, and, with\nsome gentle urging, consented. It was only after the meal was over\nthat it was learned that this was the first square meal these men had\nhad in over forty-eight hours. They had been with Gen. Wheeler at La\nGuasimas, had rejoined Wheeler after reporting that fight, in hopes of\nmaking another “scoop,” and were now on their way to Siboney, hoping\nto buy some provisions. Poor devils! They had worked for a “scoop” at\nLa Guasimas; they had gone up on the firing-line and had sent back\nauthentic accounts of that little skirmish; but they did not make the\n“scoop.” The “scoop” was made by newspaper men who had remained on\nboard the transports, and who took the excited account of a member of\nthe command who had come back delirious with excitement, crazed with\nfear, trembling as though he had a congestive chill–who, in fact, had\ncome back faster than he had gone to the front, and in his excited\ncondition had told the story of an ambuscade; that Wheeler, Wood, and\nRoosevelt were all dead; that the enemy was as thick as the barbs on\nthe Spanish bayonet; and that he, only he, had escaped to tell the\ntale. This was the account of the battle that got back to the\nnewspapers in the form of a “scoop,” and it was nothing more nor less\nthan the excited imagination of the only coward who at that time or\never afterwards was a member of the famous Rough Riders. He was\nconsequently returned to civil life prematurely.",
        "The newspaper correspondent in Cuba was of a distinguished type. You\nrecognized him immediately. He was utterly fearless; he delighted in\ngetting up on the firing-line–that is, a few of him did. Among these\nfew might be mentioned Marshall, and Davis, and Remington, and\nMarcotte, and King, and some half-dozen others; but there was another\ntype of newspaper correspondent in Cuba, who hung around from two\nmiles and a half to three miles in rear of the firing-line, and never\nby any possibility got closer to the enemy than that. The members of\nthis guild of the newspaper fraternity were necessarily nearer the\ncable office than their more daring comrades; in fact, there were a\nfew who were known to have been eight or nine miles nearer to the\ncable office during battles, and those correspondents were the ones\nwho made the great “scoop” in the New York papers, by which a regiment\nthat laid down and skulked in the woods, or ran wildly to the rear,\nwas made to do all the fighting on the first day of July. This latter\nclass of journalists were a menace to the army, a disgrace to their\nprofession, and a blot upon humanity. Even the Cubans were ashamed of\nthem.",
        "The detachment resumed the march at half past 1, and encountered some\nvery difficult road, difficult because it needed repairs. The most\ndifficult places were the ascents and descents of the hills, and in\nnearly every case fifteen or twenty minutes’ careful investigation was\nable to discover a means of getting around the worst places in the\nroad. When it was not practicable to go around, J. Shiffer and his\nthree fellow-teamsters would take a twist of their hands in the manes\nof their long-eared chargers, and apparently lift them down, or up, as\nthe case might be, always landing on their feet and always safely. It\nwas merely a question of good driving and will to go through. The\nworst places were repaired by the detachment before these reckless\nattempts at precipice-scaling were made. At one place there was a\ndetachment of the 24th Infantry engaged in an alleged effort to repair\nthe road. They did not seem to work with much vim. Chaplain Springer,\nhaving in the morning exhorted them to repentance and a better life\nand to doing good works unto their brethren, the enemy, was engaged at\nthis point in the afternoon, it being Sunday, in a practical\ndemonstration of what he considered good works. In other words, the\nchaplain, whose religious enthusiasm no one doubts, was engaged in\nheaving rocks with his own hands to show these colored soldiers how\nthey ought to make good road, and he was doing “good works.”",
        "It is but a just tribute to Chaplains Springer and Swift, of the\nRegulars, to say that they were conspicuous in the hour of danger at\nthe point of greatest peril. In the fearless discharge of their holy\noffice, they faced all the dangers of battle; nor did they neglect the\ncare of the body while ministering to the spiritual needs of the\nsoldiers. Springer, for example, collected wood and made coffee for\nall on the firing-line, within 400 yards of the block-house at El\nCaney; and Swift was equally conspicuous in relieving suffering,\nbinding up wounds, and caring for the sick. There were probably others\nequally as daring; but the author knows of the deeds of these men, and\ndesires to pay a tribute of respect to them. Chaplains of this stamp\nare always listened to with respectful attention when they express\ntheir views of the true course of life to obtain a blessed hereafter.\nThey were in very sharp contrast to the long-visaged clerical\ngentlemen who were so much in evidence at Tampa, and who never got\nwithin 500 miles of danger.",
        "The detachment safely passed all the bad places and obstacles in the\nroad, arriving at Gen. Wheeler’s headquarters about half past 4\no’clock, and reported. It was assigned a position between the advance\noutposts and directed to dispose of its guns in such a manner as to\nsweep the hills on which these outposts were placed. High hills to the\nright at a distance of about 2000 yards were supposed to be infested\nby the enemy, and a blockhouse which stood out against the sky-line\nwas thought to contain a Spanish detachment. A high hill to the left\nat a distance of about 1000 yards had not yet been explored, and it\nwas thought probable that some of the enemy was concealed on this hill\nalso. The detachment commander was directed to report, after posting\nhis battery, in which duty he was assisted by Col. Dorst, to Gen.\nChaffee, who had charge of the outposts. The General inquired what the\nbattery consisted of, and upon being informed that “It consists of\nfour Gatling guns, posted so as to command the neighboring hills,\"\nremarked in a very contemptuous manner, “You can’t command anything.\"\nGen. Chaffee subsequently had reason to revise his opinion, if not to\nregret the expression of it.",
