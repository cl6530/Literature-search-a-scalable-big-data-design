        "M. de Boiscoran looked around him like a man who has suddenly been\nseized with vertigo, pale, as if all his blood had rushed to his\nheart.",
        "He saw nothing but mournful, dismayed faces.",
        "Anthony, his old trusted servant, was leaning against the doorpost, as\nif he feared to fall. The clerk was mending his pen in the air,\novercome with amazement. M. Daubigeon hung his head.",
        "“This is horrible!” he murmured: “this is horrible!”",
        "He fell heavily into a chair, pressing his hands on his heart, as if\nto keep down the sobs that threatened to rise. M. Galpin alone seemed\nto remain perfectly cool. The law, which he imagined he was\nrepresenting in all its dignity, knows nothing of emotions. His thin\nlips even trembled a little, as if a slight smile was about to burst\nforth: it was the cold smile of the ambitious man, who thinks he has\nplayed his little part well.",
        "Did not every thing tend to prove that Jacques de Boiscoran was the\nguilty man, and that, in the alternative between a friend, and an\nopportunity of gaining high distinction, he had chosen well? After the\nsilence of a minute, which seemed to be a century, he went and stood,\nwith arms crossed on his chest, before the accused, and asked him,–",
        "“Do you confess?”",
        "M. de Boiscoran sprang up as if moved by a spring, and said,–",
        "“What? What do you want me to confess?”",
        "“That you have committed the crime at Valpinson.”",
        "The young man pressed his hands convulsively on his brow, and cried\nout,–",
        "“But I am mad! I should have committed such a fearful, cowardly crime?\nIs that possible? Is that likely? I might confess, and you would not\nbelieve me. No! I am sure you would not believe my own words.”",
        "He would have moved the marble on his mantelpiece sooner than M.\nGalpin. The latter replied in icy tones,–",
        "“I am not part of the question here. Why will you refer to relations\nwhich must be forgotten? It is no longer the friend who speaks to you,\nnot even the man, but simply the magistrate. You were seen\"–",
        "“Who is the wretch?”",
        "“Cocoleu!”",
        "M. de Boiscoran seemed to be overwhelmed. He stammered,–",
        "“Cocoleu? That poor epileptic idiot whom the Countess Claudieuse has\npicked up?”",
        "“The same.”",
        "“And upon the strength of the senseless words of a poor imbecile I am\ncharged with incendiarism, with murder?”",
        "Never had the magistrate made such efforts to assume an air of\nimpassive dignity and icy solemnity, as when he replied,–",
        "“For an hour, at least, poor Cocoleu has been in the full enjoyment of\nhis faculties. The ways of Providence are inscrutable.”",
        "“But sir\"–",
        "“And what does Cocoleu depose? He says he saw you kindle the fire with\nyour own hands, then conceal yourself behind a pile of wood, and fire\ntwice at Count Claudieuse.”",
        "“And all that appears quite natural to you?”",
        "“No! At first it shocked me as it shocked everybody. You seem to be\nfar above all suspicion. But a moment afterwards they pick up the\ncartridge-case, which can only have belonged to you. Then, upon my\narrival here, I surprise you in bed, and find the water in which you\nhave washed your hands black with coal, and little pieces of charred\npaper swimming on top of it.”",
        "“Yes,” said M. de Boiscoran in an undertone: “it is fate.”",
        "“And that is not all,” continued the magistrate, raising his voice, “I\nexamine you, and you admit having been out from eight o’clock till\nafter midnight. I ask what you have been doing, and you refuse to tell\nme. I insist, and you tell a falsehood. In order to overwhelm you, I\nam forced to quote the evidence of young Ribot, of Gaudry, and Mrs.\nCourtois, who have seen you at the very places where you deny having\nbeen. That circumstance alone condemns you. Why should you not be\nwilling to tell me what you have been doing during those four hours?\nYou claim to be innocent. Help me, then, to establish your innocence.\nSpeak, tell me what you were doing between eight and midnight.”",
        "M. de Boiscoran had no time to answer.",
        "For some time already, half-suppressed cries, and the sound of a large\ncrowd, had come up from the courtyard. A gendarme came in quite\nexcited; and, turning to the magistrate and the commonwealth attorney,\nhe said,–",
        "“Gentlemen, there are several hundred peasants, men and women, in the\nyard, who clamor for M. de Boiscoran. They threaten to drag him down\nto the river. Some of the men are armed with pitchforks; but the women\nare the maddest. My comrade and I have done our best to keep them\nquiet.”",
        "And just then, as if to confirm what he said, the cries came nearer,\ngrowing louder and louder; and one could distinctly hear,–",
        "“Drown Boiscoran! Let us drown the incendiary!”",
        "The attorney rose, and told the gendarme,–",
        "“Go down and tell these people that the authorities are this moment\nexamining the accused; that they interrupt us; and that, if they keep\non, they will have to do with me.”",
        "The gendarme obeyed his orders. M. de Boiscoran had turned deadly\npale. He said to himself,–",
        "“These unfortunate people believe my guilt!”",
        "“Yes,” said M. Galpin, who had overheard the words; “and you would\ncomprehend their rage, for which there is good reason, if you knew all\nthat has happened.”",
        "“What else?”",
        "“Two Sauveterre firemen, one the father of five children, have\nperished in the flames. Two other men, a farmer from Brechy, and a\ngendarme who tried to rescue them, have been so seriously burned that\ntheir lives are in danger.”",
        "M. de Boiscoran said nothing.",
        "“And it is you,” continued the magistrate, “who is charged with all\nthese calamities. You see how important it is for you to exculpate\nyourself.”",
        "“Ah! how can I?”",
        "“If you are innocent, nothing is easier. Tell us how you employed\nyourself last night.”",
        "“I have told you all I can say.”",
        "The magistrate seemed to reflect for a full minute; then he said,–",
        "“Take care, M. de Boiscoran: I shall have to have you arrested.”",
        "“Do so.”",
        "“I shall be obliged to order your arrest at once, and to send you to\njail in Sauveterre.”",
        "“Very well.”",
        "“Then you confess?”",
        "“I confess that I am the victim of an unheard-of combination of\ncircumstances; I confess that you are right, and that certain\nfatalities can only be explained by the belief in Providence: but I\nswear by all that is holy in the world, I am innocent.”",
        "“Prove it.”",
        "“Ah! would I not do it if I could?”",
        "“Be good enough, then, to dress, sir, and to follow the gendarmes.”",
        "Without a word, M. de Boiscoran went into his dressing-room, followed\nby his servant, who carried him his clothes. M. Galpin was so busy\ndictating to the clerk the latter part of the examination, that he\nseemed to forget his prisoner. Old Anthony availed himself of this\nopportunity.",
        "“Sir,” he whispered into his master’s ear while helping him to put on\nhis clothes.",
        "“What?”",
        "“Hush! Don’t speak so loud! The other window is open. It is only about\ntwenty feet to the ground: the ground is soft. Close by is one of the\ncellar openings; and in there, you know, there is the old hiding-\nplace. It is only five miles to the coast, and I will have a good\nhorse ready for you to-night, at the park-gate.”",
        "A bitter smile rose on M. de Boiscoran’s lips, as he said,–",
        "“And you too, my old friend: you think I am guilty?”",
        "“I conjure you,” said Anthony, “I answer for any thing. It is barely\ntwenty feet. In your mother’s name\"–",
        "But, instead of answering him, M. de Boiscoran turned round, and\ncalled M. Galpin. When he had come in, he said to him, “Look at that\nwindow, sir! I have money, fast horses; and the sea is only five miles\noff. A guilty man would have escaped. I stay here; for I am innocent.”",
        "In one point, at least, M. de Boiscoran had been right. Nothing would\nhave been easier for him than to escape, to get into the garden, and\nto reach the hiding-place which his servant had suggested to him. But\nafter that? He had, to be sure, with old Anthony’s assistance, some\nchance of escaping altogether. But, after all, he might have been\nfound out in his hiding-place, or he might have been overtaken in his\nride to the coast. Even if he had succeeded, what would have become of\nhim? His flight would necessarily have been looked upon as a\nconfession of his guilt.",
        "Under such circumstances, to resist the temptation to escape, and to\nmake this resistance well known, was in fact not so much an evidence\nof innocence as a proof of great cleverness. M. Galpin, at all events,\nlooked upon it in that light; for he judged others by himself.\nCarefully and cunningly calculating every step he took in life, he did\nnot believe in sudden inspirations. He said, therefore, with an\nironical smile, which was to show that he was not so easily taken\nin,–",
        "“Very well, sir. This circumstance shall be mentioned, as well as the\nothers, at the trial.”",
        "Very differently thought the commonwealth attorney and the clerk. If\nthe magistrate had been too much engaged in his dictation to notice\nany thing, they had been perfectly able to notice the great excitement\nunder which the accused had naturally labored. Perfectly amazed at\nfirst, and thinking, for a moment, that the whole was a joke, he had\nnext become furiously angry; then fear and utter dejection had\nfollowed one another. But in precise proportion as the charges had\naccumulated, and the evidence had become overwhelming, he had, so far\nfrom becoming demoralized, seemed to recover his assurance.",
        "“There is something curious about it,” growled Mechinet. M. Daubigeon,\non the other hand, said nothing; but when M. de Boiscoran came out of\nhis dressing-room, fully dressed and ready, he said,–",
        "“One more question, sir.”",
        "The poor man bowed. He was pale, but calm and self-possessed.",
        "“I am ready to reply,” he said.",
        "“I’ll be brief. You seemed to be surprised and indignant at any one’s\ndaring to accuse you. That was weakness. Justice is but the work of\nman, and must needs judge by appearances. If you reflect, you will see\nthat the appearances are all against you.”",
        "“I see it but too clearly.”",
        "“If you were on a jury, you would not hesitate to pronounce a man\nguilty upon such evidence.”",
        "“No, sir, no!”",
        "The commonwealth attorney bounded from his chair. He said,–",
        "“You are not sincere!”",
        "M. de Boiscoran sadly shook his head, and replied,–",
        "“I speak to you without the slightest hope of convincing you, but in\nall sincerity. No, I should not condemn a man, as you say, if he\nasserted his innocence, and if I did not see any reason for his crime.\nFor, after all, unless a man is mad, he does not commit a crime for\nnothing. Now I ask you, how could I, upon whom fortune has always\nsmiled; I who am on the eve of marrying one whom I love passionately,\n–how could I have set Valpinson on fire, and tried to murder Count\nClaudieuse?”",
        "M. Galpin had scarcely been able to disguise his impatience, when he\nsaw the attorney take part in the affair. Seizing, therefore, the\nopportunity to interfere, he said,–",
        "“Your reason, sir, was hatred. You hated the count and the countess\nmortally. Do not protest: it is of no use. Everybody knows it; and you\nyourself have told me so.”",
        "M. de Boiscoran looked as if he were growing still more pale, and then\nreplied in a tone of crushing disdain,–",
        "“Even if that were so, I do not see what right you have to abuse the\nconfidence of a friend, after having declared, upon your arrival here,\nthat all friendship between us had ceased. But that is not so. I never\ntold you any such thing. As my feelings have never changed, I can\nrepeat literally what I have said. I have told you that the count was\na troublesome neighbor, a stickler for his rights, and almost absurdly\nattached to his preserves. I have also told you, that, if he declared\nmy public opinions to be abominable, I looked upon his as ridiculous\nand dangerous. As for the countess, I have simply said, half in jest,\nthat so perfect a person was not to my taste; and that I should be\nvery unhappy if my wife were a Madonna, who hardly ever deigned to put\nher foot upon the ground.”",
        "“And that was the only reason why you once pointed your gun at Count\nClaudieuse? A little more blood rushing to your head would have made\nyou a murderer on that day.”",
        "A terrible spasm betrayed M. de Boiscoran’s fury; but he checked\nhimself, and said,–",
        "“My passion was less fiery than it may have looked. I have the most\nprofound respect for the count’s character. It is an additional grief\nto me that he should have accused me.”",
        "“But he has not accused you!” broke in M. Daubigeon. “On the contrary,\nhe was the first and the most eager to defend you.”",
        "And, in spite of the signs which M. Galpin made, he continued,–",
        "“Unfortunately that has nothing to do with the force of the evidence\nagainst you. If you persist in keeping silence, you must look for a\ncriminal trial for the galleys. If you are innocent, why not explain\nthe matter? What do you wait for? What do you hope?”",
        "“Nothing.”",
        "Mechinet had, in the meantime, completed the official report.",
        "“We must go,” said M. Galpin",
        "“Am I at liberty,” asked M. de Boiscoran, “to write a few lines to my\nfather and my mother? They are old: such an event may kill them.”",
        "“Impossible!” said the magistrate.",
        "Then, turning to Anthony, he said,–",
        "“I am going to put the seals on this room, and I shall leave it in the\nmeanwhile in your keeping. You know your duty, and the penalties to\nwhich you would be subject, if, at the proper time, every thing is not\nfound in the same condition in which it is left now. Now, how shall we\nget back to Sauveterre?”",
        "After mature deliberation it was decided that M. de Boiscoran should\ngo in one of his own carriages, accompanied by one of the gendarmes.\nM. Daubigeon, the magistrate, and the clerk would return in the\nmayor’s carriage, driven by Ribot, who was furious at being kept under\nsurveillance.",
        "“Let us be off,” said the magistrate, when the last formalities had\nbeen fulfilled.",
        "M. de Boiscoran came down slowly. He knew the court was full of\nfurious peasants; and he expected to be received with hootings. It was\nnot so. The gendarme whom the attorney had sent down had done his duty\nso well, that not a cry was heard. But when he had taken his seat in\nthe carriage, and the horse went off at a trot, fierce curses arose,\nand a shower of stones fell, one of which wounded a gendarme.",
        "“Upon my word, you bring ill luck, prisoner,” said the man, a friend\nof the other gendarme who had been so much injured at the fire.",
        "M. de Boiscoran made no reply. He sank back into the corner, and\nseemed to fall into a kind of stupor, from which he did not rouse\nhimself till the carriage drove into the yard of the prison at\nSauveterre. On the threshold stood Master Blangin, the jailer, smiling\nwith delight at the idea of receiving so distinguished a prisoner.",
        "“I am going to give you my best room,” he said, “but first I have to\ngive a receipt to the gendarme, and to enter you in my book.\"\nThereupon he took down his huge, greasy register, and wrote the name\nof Jacques de Boiscoran beneath that of Trumence Cheminot, a vagabond\nwho had just been arrested for having broken into a garden.",
        "It was all over. Jacques de Boiscoran was a prisoner, to be kept in\nclose confinement.",
