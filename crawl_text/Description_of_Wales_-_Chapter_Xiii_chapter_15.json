In the northern\ndistrict of Britain, beyond the Humber, and on the borders of\nYorkshire, the inhabitants make use of the same kind of symphonious\nharmony, but with less variety; singing only in two parts, one\nmurmuring in the base, the other warbling in the acute or treble.\nNeither of the two nations has acquired this peculiarity by art,\nbut by long habit, which has rendered it natural and familiar; and\nthe practice is now so firmly rooted in them, that it is unusual to\nhear a simple and single melody well sung; and, what is still more\nwonderful, the children, even from their infancy, sing in the same\nmanner.  As the English in general do not adopt this mode of\nsinging, but only those of the northern countries, I believe that\nit was from the Danes and Norwegians, by whom these parts of the\nisland were more frequently invaded, and held longer under their\ndominion, that the natives contracted their mode of singing as well\nas speaking.",
