        "\n\n",
        "One might classify the kings of England in many ways. John was\nundoubtedly the most unpopular. The impetuous yet far-seeing Henry\nII., with the other two great warriors, Edward I. and Edward III.,\nand William of Orange, did most for the foundation and development\nof England’s constitutional law. Some monarchs, such as Edward II.\nand the womanish Henry VI., have been contemptible. Hard-working,\nuseful kings have been Henry VII., the Georges, William IV., and\nespecially the last Edward.",
        "If we consider those monarchs who have in some curious way touched\nthe popular fancy without reference to their virtues we must go\nback to Richard of the Lion Heart, who saw but little of England,\nyet was the best essentially English king, and to Henry V.,\ngallant soldier and conqueror of France. Even Henry VIII. had a\nwarm place in the affection of his countrymen, few of whom saw him\nnear at hand, but most of whom made him a sort of regal\nincarnation of John Bull–wrestling and tilting and boxing, eating\ngreat joints of beef, and staying his thirst with flagons of ale–\na big, healthy, masterful animal, in fact, who gratified the\nnational love of splendor and stood up manfully in his struggle\nwith the Pope.",
        "But if you look for something more than ordinary popularity–\nsomething that belongs to sentiment and makes men willing to\nbecome martyrs for a royal cause–we must find these among the\nStuart kings. It is odd, indeed, that even at this day there are\nEnglishmen and Englishwomen who believe their lawful sovereign to\nbe a minor Bavarian princess in whose veins there runs the Stuart\nblood. Prayers are said for her at English shrines, and toasts are\ndrunk to her in rare old wine.",
        "Of course, to-day this cult of the Stuarts is nothing but a fad.\nNo one ever expects to see a Stuart on the English throne. But it\nis significant of the deep strain of romance which the six Stuarts\nwho reigned in England have implanted in the English heart. The\nold Jacobite ballads still have power to thrill. Queen Victoria\nherself used to have the pipers file out before her at Balmoral to\nthe “skirling” of “Bonnie Dundee,” “Over the Water to Charlie,\"\nand “Wha’ll Be King but Charlie!” It is a sentiment that has never\ndied. Her late majesty used to say that when she heard these tunes\nshe became for the moment a Jacobite; just as the Empress Eugenie\nat the height of her power used pertly to remark that she herself\nwas the only Legitimist left in France.",
        "It may be suggested that the Stuarts are still loved by many\nEnglishmen because they were unfortunate; yet this is hardly true,\nafter all. Many of them were fortunate enough. The first of them,\nKing James, an absurd creature, speaking broad Scotch, timid,\nfoolishly fond of favorites, and having none of the dignity of a\nmonarch, lived out a lengthy reign. The two royal women of the\nfamily–Anne and Mary–had no misfortunes of a public nature.\nCharles II. reigned for more than a quarter of a century, lapped\nin every kind of luxury, and died a king.",
        "The first Charles was beheaded and afterward styled a “saint\"; yet\nthe majority of the English people were against his arrogance, or\nelse he would have won his great struggle against Parliament. The\nsecond James was not popular at all. Nevertheless, no sooner had\nhe been expelled, and been succeeded by a Dutchman gnawing\nasparagus and reeking of cheeses, than there was already a Stuart\nlegend. Even had there been no pretenders to carry on the cult,\nthe Stuarts would still have passed into history as much loved by\nthe people.",
        "It only shows how very little in former days the people expected\nof a regnant king. Many monarchs have had just a few popular\ntraits, and these have stood out brilliantly against the darkness\nof the background.",
        "No one could have cared greatly for the first James, but Charles\nI. was indeed a kingly personage when viewed afar. He was\nhandsome, as a man, fully equaling the French princess who became\nhis wife. He had no personal vices. He was brave, and good to look\nupon, and had a kingly mien. Hence, although he sought to make his\nrule over England a tyranny, there were many fine old cavaliers to\nride afield for him when he raised his standard, and who, when he\ndied, mourned for him as a “martyr.”",
        "Many hardships they underwent while Cromwell ruled with his iron\nhand; and when that iron hand was relaxed in death, and poor,\nfeeble Richard Cromwell slunk away to his country-seat, what\nwonder is it that young Charles came back to England and caracoled\nthrough the streets of London with a smile for every one and a\nhappy laugh upon his lips? What wonder is it that the cannon in\nthe Tower thundered a loud welcome, and that all over England, at\none season or another, maypoles rose and Christmas fires blazed?\nFor Englishmen at heart are not only monarchists, but they are\nlovers of good cheer and merrymaking and all sorts of mirth.",
        "Charles II. might well at first have seemed a worthier and wiser\nsuccessor to his splendid father. As a child, even, he had shown\nhimself to be no faint-hearted creature. When the great Civil War\nbroke out he had joined his father’s army. It met with disaster at\nEdgehill, and was finally shattered by the crushing defeat of\nNaseby, which afterward inspired Macaulay’s most stirring ballad.",
        "Charles was then only a child of twelve, and so his followers did\nwisely in hurrying him out of England, through the Scilly isles\nand Jersey to his mother’s place of exile. Of course, a child so\nvery young could be of no value as a leader, though his presence\nmight prove an inspiration.",
        "In 1648, however, when he was eighteen years of age, he gathered a\nfleet of eighteen ships and cruised along the English coast,\ntaking prizes, which he carried to the Dutch ports. When he was at\nHolland’s capital, during his father’s trial, he wrote many\nmessages to the Parliamentarians, and even sent them a blank\ncharter, which they might fill in with any stipulations they\ndesired if only they would save and restore their king.",
        "When the head of Charles rolled from the velvet-covered block his\nson showed himself to be no loiterer or lover of an easy life. He\nhastened to Scotland, skilfully escaping an English force, and was\nproclaimed as king and crowned at Scone, in 1651. With ten\nthousand men he dashed into England, where he knew there were many\nwho would rally at his call. But it was then that Cromwell put\nforth his supreme military genius and with his Ironsides crushed\nthe royal troops at Worcester.",
        "Charles knew that for the present all was lost. He showed courage\nand address in covering the flight of his beaten soldiers; but he\nsoon afterward went to France, remaining there and in the\nNetherlands for eight years as a pensioner of Louis XIV. He knew\nthat time would fight for him far more surely than infantry and\nhorse. England had not been called “Merry England” for nothing;\nand Cromwell’s tyranny was likely to be far more resented than the\nheavy hand of one who was born a king. So Charles at Paris and\nLiege, though he had little money at the time, managed to maintain\na royal court, such as it was.",
        "Here there came out another side of his nature. As a child he had\nborne hardship and privation and had seen the red blood flow upon\nthe battlefield. Now, as it were, he allowed a certain sensuous,\npleasure-loving ease to envelop him. The red blood should become\nthe rich red burgundy; the sound of trumpets and kettledrums\nshould give way to the melody of lutes and viols. He would be a\nking of pleasure if he were to be king at all. And therefore his\ncourt, even in exile, was a court of gallantry and ease. The Pope\nrefused to lend him money, and the King of France would not\nincrease his pension, but there were many who foresaw that Charles\nwould not long remain in exile; and so they gave him what he\nwanted and waited until he could give them what they would ask for\nin their turn.",
        "Charles at this time was not handsome, like his father. His\ncomplexion was swarthy, his figure by no means imposing, though\nalways graceful. When he chose he could bear himself with all the\ndignity of a monarch. He had a singularly pleasant manner, and a\nword from him could win over the harshest opponent.",
        "The old cavaliers who accompanied their master in exile were like\nNapoleon’s veterans in Elba. With their tall, powerful forms they\nstalked about the courtyards, sniffing their disapproval at these\nforeign ways and longing grimly for the time when they could once\nmore smell the pungent powder of the battle-field. But, as Charles\nhad hoped, the change was coming. Not merely were his own subjects\nbeginning to long for him and to pray in secret for the king, but\ncontinental monarchs who maintained spies in England began to know\nof this. To them Charles was no longer a penniless exile. He was a\nking who before long would take possession of his kingdom.",
        "A very wise woman–the Queen Regent of Portugal–was the first to\nact on this information. Portugal was then very far from being a\npetty state. It had wealth at home and rich colonies abroad, while\nits flag was seen on every sea. The queen regent, being at odds\nwith Spain, and wishing to secure an ally against that power, made\novertures to Charles, asking him whether a match might not be made\nbetween him and the Princess Catharine of Braganza. It was not\nmerely her daughter’s hand that she offered, but a splendid dowry.\nShe would pay Charles a million pounds in gold and cede to England\ntwo valuable ports.",
        "The match was not yet made, but by 1659 it had been arranged. The\nSpaniards were furious, for Charles’s cause began to appear\nsuccessful.",
        "She was a quaint and rather piteous little figure, she who was\ndestined to be the wife of the Merry Monarch. Catharine was dark,\npetite, and by no means beautiful; yet she had a very sweet\nexpression and a heart of utter innocence. She had been wholly\nconvent-bred. She knew nothing of the world. She was told that in\nmarriage she must obey in all things, and that the chief duty of a\nwife was to make her husband happy.",
        "Poor child! It was a too gracious preparation for a very graceless\nhusband. Charles, in exile, had already made more than one\ndiscreditable connection and he was already the father of more\nthan one growing son.",
        "First of all, he had been smitten by the bold ways of one Lucy\nWalters. Her impudence amused the exiled monarch. She was not\nparticularly beautiful, and when she spoke as others did she was\nrather tiresome; but her pertness and the inexperience of the king\nwhen he went into exile made her seem attractive. She bore him a\nson, in the person of that brilliant adventurer whom Charles\nafterward created Duke of Monmouth. Many persons believe that\nCharles had married Lucy Walters, just as George IV. may have\nmarried Mrs. Fitzherbert; yet there is not the slightest proof of\nit, and it must be classed with popular legends.",
        "There was also one Catherine Peg, or Kep, whose son was afterward\nmade Earl of Plymouth. It must be confessed that in his\nattachments to English women Charles showed little care for rank\nor station. Lucy Walters and Catherine Peg were very illiterate\ncreatures.",
        "In a way it was precisely this sort of preference that made\nCharles so popular among the people. He seemed to make rank of no\naccount, but would chat in the most familiar and friendly way with\nany one whom he happened to meet. His easy, democratic manner,\ncoupled with the grace and prestige of royalty, made friends for\nhim all over England. The treasury might be nearly bankrupt; the\nnavy might be routed by the Dutch; the king himself might be too\nmuch given to dissipation; but his people forgave him all, because\neverybody knew that Charles would clap an honest citizen on the\nback and joke with all who came to see him feed the swans in\nRegent’s Park.",
        "The popular name for him was “Rowley,” or “Old Rowley\"–a nickname\nof mysterious origin, though it is said to have been given him\nfrom a fancied resemblance to a famous hunter in his stables.\nPerhaps it is the very final test of popularity that a ruler\nshould have a nickname known to every one.",
        "Cromwell’s death roused all England to a frenzy of king-worship.\nThe Roundhead, General Monk, and his soldiers proclaimed Charles\nKing of England and escorted him to London in splendid state. That\nwas a day when national feeling reached a point such as never has\nbeen before or since. Oughtred, the famous mathematician, died of\njoy when the royal emblems were restored. Urquhart, the translator\nof Rabelais, died, it is said, of laughter at the people’s wild\ndelight–a truly Rabelaisian end.",
        "There was the king once more; and England, breaking through its\nlong period of Puritanism, laughed and danced with more vivacity\nthan ever the French had shown. All the pipers and the players and\npanderers to vice, the mountebanks, the sensual men, and the\nlawless women poured into the presence of the king, who had been\ntoo long deprived of the pleasure that his nature craved.\nParliament voted seventy thousand pounds for a memorial to\nCharles’s father, but the irresponsible king spent the whole sum\non the women who surrounded him. His severest counselor, Lord\nClarendon, sent him a remonstrance.",
        "“How can I build such a memorial,” asked Charles, “when I don’t\nknow where my father’s remains are buried!”",
        "He took money from the King of France to make war against the\nDutch, who had befriended him. It was the French king, too, who\nsent him that insidious, subtle daughter of Brittany, Louise de\nKeroualle–Duchess of Portsmouth–a diplomat in petticoats, who\nwon the king’s wayward affections, and spied on what he did and\nsaid, and faithfully reported all of it to Paris. She became the\nmother of the Duke of Lenox, and she was feared and hated by the\nEnglish more than any other of his mistresses. They called her\n“Madam Carwell,” and they seemed to have an instinct that she was\nno mere plaything of his idle hours, but was like some strange\nexotic serpent, whose poison might in the end sting the honor of\nEngland.",
        "There is a pitiful little episode in the marriage of Charles with\nhis Portuguese bride, Catharine of Braganza. The royal girl came\nto him fresh from the cloisters of her convent. There was\nsomething about her grace and innocence that touched the dissolute\nmonarch, who was by no means without a heart. For a time he\ntreated her with great respect, and she was happy. At last she\nbegan to notice about her strange faces–faces that were evil,\nwanton, or overbold. The court became more and more a seat of\nreckless revelry.",
        "Finally Catharine was told that the Duchess of Cleveland–that\nsplendid termagant, Barbara Villiers–had been appointed lady of\nthe bedchamber. She was told at the same time who this vixen was–\nthat she was no fit attendant for a virtuous woman, and that her\nthree sons, the Dukes of Southampton, Grafton, and Northumberland,\nwere also the sons of Charles.",
        "Fluttered and frightened and dismayed, the queen hastened to her\nhusband and begged him not to put this slight upon her. A year or\ntwo before, she had never dreamed that life contained such things\nas these; but now it seemed to contain nothing else. Charles spoke\nsternly to her until she burst into tears, and then he petted her\nand told her that her duty as a queen compelled her to submit to\nmany things which a lady in private life need not endure.",
        "After a long and poignant struggle with her own emotions the\nlittle Portuguese yielded to the wishes of her lord. She never\nagain reproached him. She even spoke with kindness to his\nfavorites and made him feel that she studied his happiness alone.\nHer gentleness affected him so that he always spoke to her with\ncourtesy and real friendship. When the Protestant mobs sought to\ndrive her out of England he showed his courage and manliness by\nstanding by her and refusing to allow her to be molested.",
        "Indeed, had Charles been always at his best he would have had a\nvery different name in history. He could be in every sense a king.\nHe had a keen knowledge of human nature. Though he governed\nEngland very badly, he never governed it so badly as to lose his\npopularity.",
        "The epigram of Rochester, written at the king’s own request, was\nsingularly true of Charles. No man relied upon his word, yet men\nloved him. He never said anything that was foolish, and he very\nseldom did anything that was wise; yet his easy manners and\ngracious ways endeared him to those who met him.",
        "One can find no better picture of his court than that which Sir\nWalter Scott has drawn so vividly in Peveril of the Peak; or, if\none wishes first-hand evidence, it can be found in the diaries of\nEvelyn and of Samuel Pepys. In them we find the rakes and dicers,\nfull of strange oaths, deep drunkards, vile women and still viler\nmen, all striving for the royal favor and offering the filthiest\nlures, amid routs and balls and noisy entertainments, of which it\nis recorded that more than once some woman gave birth to a child\namong the crowd of dancers.",
        "No wonder that the little Portuguese queen kept to herself and did\nnot let herself be drawn into this swirling, roaring, roistering\nsaturnalia. She had less influence even than Moll Davis, whom\nCharles picked out of a coffee-house, and far less than “Madam\nCarwell,” to whom it is reported that a great English nobleman\nonce presented pearls to the value of eight thousand pounds in\norder to secure her influence in a single stroke of political\nbusiness.",
        "Of all the women who surrounded Charles there was only one who\ncared anything for him or for England. The rest were all either\nselfish or treacherous or base. This one exception has been so\ngreatly written of, both in fiction and in history, as to make it\nseem almost unnecessary to add another word; yet it may well be\nworth while to separate the fiction from the fact and to see how\nmuch of the legend of Eleanor Gwyn is true.",
        "The fanciful story of her birthplace is most surely quite\nunfounded. She was not the daughter of a Welsh officer, but of two\npetty hucksters who had their booth in the lowest precincts of\nLondon. In those days the Strand was partly open country, and as\nit neared the city it showed the mansions of the gentry set in\ntheir green-walled parks. At one end of the Strand, however, was\nDrury Lane, then the haunt of criminals and every kind of wretch,\nwhile nearer still was the notorious Coal Yard, where no citizen\ndared go unarmed.",
        "Within this dreadful place children were kidnapped and trained to\nvarious forms of vice. It was a school for murderers and robbers\nand prostitutes; and every night when the torches flared it\nvomited forth its deadly spawn. Here was the earliest home of\nEleanor Gwyn, and out of this den of iniquity she came at night to\nsell oranges at the entrance to the theaters. She was stage-\nstruck, and endeavored to get even a minor part in a play; but\nBetterton, the famous actor, thrust her aside when she ventured to\napply to him.",
        "It must be said that in everything that was external, except her\nbeauty, she fell short of a fastidious taste. She was intensely\nignorant even for that time. She spoke in a broad Cockney dialect.\nShe had lived the life of the Coal Yard, and, like Zola’s Nana,\nshe could never remember the time when she had known the meaning\nof chastity.",
        "Nell Gwyn was, in fact, a product of the vilest slums of London;\nand precisely because she was this we must set her down as\nintrinsically a good woman–one of the truest, frankest, and most\nright-minded of whom the history of such women has anything to\ntell. All that external circumstances could do to push her down\ninto the mire was done; yet she was not pushed down, but emerged\nas one of those rare souls who have in their natures an\nuncontaminated spring of goodness and honesty. Unlike Barbara\nVilliers or Lucy Walters or Louise de Keroualle, she was neither a\nharpy nor a foe to England.",
        "Charles is said first to have met her when he, incognito, with\nanother friend, was making the rounds of the theaters at night.\nThe king spied her glowing, nut-brown face in one of the boxes,\nand, forgetting his incognito, went up and joined her. She was\nwith her protector of the time, Lord Buckhurst, who, of course,\nrecognized his majesty.",
        "Presently the whole party went out to a neighboring coffee-house,\nwhere they drank and ate together. When it came time to pay the\nreckoning the king found that he had no money, nor had his friend.\nLord Buckhurst, therefore, paid the bill, while Mistress Nell\njeered at the other two, saying that this was the most poverty-\nstricken party that she had ever met.",
        "Charles did not lose sight of her. Her frankness and honest manner\npleased him. There came a time when she was known to be a mistress\nof the king, and she bore a son, who was ennobled as the Duke of\nSt. Albans, but who did not live to middle age. Nell Gwyn was much\nwith Charles; and after his tempestuous scenes with Barbara\nVilliers, and the feeling of dishonor which the Duchess of\nPortsmouth made him experience, the girl’s good English bluntness\nwas a pleasure far more rare than sentiment.",
        "Somehow, just as the people had come to mistrust “Madam Carwell,\"\nso they came to like Nell Gwyn. She saw enough of Charles, and she\nliked him well enough, to wish that he might do his duty by his\npeople; and she alone had the boldness to speak out what she\nthought. One day she found him lolling in an arm-chair and\ncomplaining that the people were not satisfied.",
        "“You can very easily satisfy them,” said Nell Gwyn. “Dismiss your\nwomen and attend to the proper business of a king.”",
        "Again, her heart was touched at the misfortunes of the old\nsoldiers who had fought for Charles and for his father during the\nCivil War, and who were now neglected, while the treasury was\nemptied for French favorites, and while the policy of England\nitself was bought and sold in France. Many and many a time, when\nother women of her kind used their lures to get jewels or titles\nor estates or actual heaps of money, Nell Gwyn besought the king\nto aid these needy veterans. Because of her efforts Chelsea\nHospital was founded. Such money as she had she shared with the\npoor and with those who had fought for her royal lover.",
        "As I have said, she is a historical type of the woman who loses\nher physical purity, yet who retains a sense of honor and of\nhonesty which nothing can take from her. There are not many such\nexamples, and therefore this one is worth remembering.",
        "Of anecdotes concerning her there are many, but not often has\ntheir real import been detected. If she could twine her arms about\nthe monarch’s neck and transport him in a delirium of passion,\nthis was only part of what she did. She tried to keep him right\nand true and worthy of his rank; and after he had ceased to care\nmuch for her as a lover he remembered that she had been faithful\nin many other things.",
        "Then there came the death-bed scene, when Charles, in his\ninimitable manner, apologized to those about him because he was so\nlong in dying. A far sincerer sentence was that which came from\nhis heart, as he cried out, in the very pangs of death:",
        "“Do not let poor Nelly starve!”",
