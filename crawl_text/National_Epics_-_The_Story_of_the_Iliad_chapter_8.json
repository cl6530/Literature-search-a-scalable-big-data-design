        "For nine years a fleet of one thousand one hundred and eighty-six ships\nand an army of more than one hundred thousand Greeks, under the command of\nAgamemnon, lay before King Priam’s city of Troy to avenge the wrongs of\nMenelaus, King of Sparta, and to reclaim Helen, his wife, who had been\ncarried away by Priam’s son Paris, at the instigation of Venus.",
        "Though they had not succeeded in taking Troy, the Greeks had conquered\nmany of the surrounding cities. From one of these, Agamemnon had taken as\nhis share of the booty Chryseis, the beautiful daughter of the priest\nChryses; and when her father had come to ransom her, he had been insulted\nand driven away by the king. Chryses had prayed to Apollo for revenge, and\nthe god had sent upon the Greeks a pestilence which was slaying so many\nthousands that a meeting was called to consult upon what to do to check\nthe plague and conciliate the god.",
        "Calchas the seer had declared that the plague was sent because of the\ndetention of Chryseis, and Agamemnon, though indignant with the priest,\nannounced that he would send her back to save his army from destruction.\n“Note, however,” said he, “that I have now given up my booty. See that I\nam recompensed for what I lose.”",
        "Then rose the leader of the Myrmidons, swift-footed Achilles, in his\nwrath, and denounced Agamemnon for his greediness.",
        "“Thou hast ever had thy share and more of all the booty, and thou knowest\nwell that there is now no common store from which to give thee spoil. But\nwait until Troy town is sacked, and we will gladly give thee three and\nfourfold thy recompense.”",
        "The angry Agamemnon declared that if he were not given the worth of what\nhe had lost he would seize the maidens of Ajax and Ulysses, or Achilles’\nmaid, Briseis.",
        "Achilles was beside himself with rage. He had not come to Troy to\ncontribute to Agamemnon’s glory. He and his followers had long borne the\nbrunt of battle only to see the largest share of booty given to Agamemnon,\nwho lay idle in his ships. Sooner than endure longer such indignity he\nwould return home to Phthia.",
        "“Go!” replied Agamemnon. “I detest thee and thy ways. Go back over the sea\nand rule over thy Myrmidons. But since Phoebus has taken away my maid, I\nwill carry off thy prize, thy rosy-cheeked Briseis, that thou may’st learn\nthat I am indeed king.”",
        "Warned by Pallas Athene, Achilles took his hand from his sword hilt, and\ncontented himself with telling Agamemnon that he would see the day when he\nwould fret to think he had driven Achilles from the Grecian ranks.",
        "Though the persuasive orator, Nestor, endeavored to make peace between the\nchiefs, Agamemnon could not be softened. As soon as the black ship bearing\nChryseis set sail, he sent his unwilling men to where Achilles sat by his\ntent, beside the barren deep, to take the fair Briseis, whom Achilles\nordered to be led forth to them. Then the long days dragged by in the tent\nwhere the chief sat eating his heart out in idleness, while his men\nengaged in athletic sports, and the rest of the Greeks fought before Troy.",
        "Both armies, worn out with indecisive battles, gladly hailed Hector’s\nproposal that a combat between Paris and Menelaus should decide the war.",
        "As the armies stood in silence, watching the preparations for the combat,\nHelen, summoned by Iris, left her room in Priam’s palace, where she was\nweaving among her maidens, and, robed and veiled in white, and shedding\ntears at the recollection of her former home and husband, went down to the\nScaean gates, where sat Priam and the men too old for war. When they saw\nbright-haired Helen they whispered among themselves that it was little\nwonder that men warred for her sake, so fair was she, so like unto the\ndeathless goddesses.",
        "In response to Priam’s tender greeting she seated herself beside him and\npointed out the Greek heroes,–Agamemnon, ruler over wide lands, crafty\nUlysses, and the mighty Ajax; but she strained her eyes in vain for a\nsight of her dearly loved brothers, Castor and Pollux, not knowing that\nthey already lay dead in pleasant Lacedaemon.",
        "In the single combat between Paris and Menelaus, the spear of the Greek\nwas fixed in Paris’s buckler, and his sword was shivered on his helmet\nwithout injury to the Trojan. But, determined to overcome his hateful foe,\nMenelaus seized Paris by the helm and dragged him towards the Grecian\nranks. Great glory would have been his had not the watchful Venus loosed\nthe helm and snatched away the god-like Paris in a cloud. While the Greeks\ndemanded Helen and her wealth as the price of Menelaus’s victory,\nPandarus, prompted by Pallas, broke the truce by a shot aimed at Menelaus,\nand the battle soon raged with greater fury than before.",
        "Diomed, having received new strength and courage from Pallas, rushed madly\nover the field, falling upon the affrighted Trojans like a lion in the\nsheepfold; then, made more presumptuous by his success, and forgetful of\nthe few years promised the man who dares to meet the gods in battle, the\narrogant warrior struck at Venus and wounded her in the wrist, so that,\nshrieking with pain, she yielded Æneas to Apollo, and fled to Olympus.",
        "Perceiving that the Trojans were unable to withstand the fury of Diomed,\nassisted as he was by Pallas and Juno, Hector hastened homeward to order a\nsacrifice to Pallas that she might look with more favor upon their cause.",
        "Having instructed his mother to lay her richest robe on Pallas’s shrine,\nHector sought his wife, the white-armed Andromache, and their babe,\nAstyanax. Andromache entreated Hector to go forth no more to battle, to\nlose his life and leave their babe fatherless; but Hector, upon whom the\ncares of war sat heavily, bade her a tender farewell, and kissing the\nbabe, returned with Paris to the field.",
        "Incited by Pallas and Apollo, Helenus suggested to his brother Hector that\nhe should challenge the bravest of the Greeks to single combat. The lot\nfell to Ajax the Greater, and the two mighty heroes contested with spears\nand stones until twilight fell, and they were parted by a herald.",
        "That night the Greeks feasted, and when, the next morning, a Trojan\nmessenger offered them the treasures of Helen if they would withdraw from\nTroy, and proposed a truce, they indignantly rejected the offer, declaring\nthat they would not even accept Helen herself, but agreed upon a truce in\nwhich to bury the dead.",
        "When the battle was renewed, Jupiter forbade the gods to take part.\nOpposed by no celestial foes, the Trojans were this day successful, and\nhaving pursued the Greeks to the ships, sat all night, full of hope,\naround their thousand watch fires, waiting for the morn.",
        "In the Grecian camp, however, a different scene was being enacted.\nDisheartened by their defeat, Agamemnon proposed that the armies give up\nthe siege and return to Greece.",
        "Angry at his weakness, Diomed thus reproached him:–",
        "“The gods have granted thee high rank and rule, but thou hast no\nfortitude. Return if thou desirest. Still enough long-haired Achaians will\nremain to take the city. If they desire to go as well, at least Sthenelus\nand I will remain until Troy is ours. We have the gods with us.”",
        "At the suggestion of Nestor a banquet was spread, and after the hunger of\nall was appeased, the peril of the Greeks was discussed in the Council of\nthe Elders. Here Nestor showed Agamemnon that the trouble began at the\nhour when he drove Achilles from their ranks by appropriating Briseis.",
        "Ill fortune had humbled the haughty Agamemnon, and he confessed that he\nhad done wrong. “For this wrong, however,” said he, “I am ready to make\nample amends. Priceless gifts I will send to Achilles: seven tripods, six\ntalents of pure gold, twenty shining caldrons, twelve steeds, seven\ndamsels, among them Briseis; not only this, when Priam’s citadel falls, he\nshall be the first to load his galley down with gold and silver and with\nTrojan maidens. Better yet, I will unite him to me by the ties of\nmarriage. I will give him my daughter for a wife, and with her for a dower\nwill go seven cities near the sea, rich in flocks and herds. Then let him\nyield, and join us in taking Troy.”",
        "Joyfully the messengers–Ajax, Ulysses, and the aged Phoenix, carefully\ninstructed by Nestor–set forth on their embassy. As they neared the tents\nof the Myrmidons their ears were struck by the notes of a silver harp\ntouched by Achilles to solace him in his loneliness. His friend Patroclus\nsat beside him in silence. Achilles and Patroclus greeted the messengers\nwarmly, mingled the pure wine, and spread a feast for them. This over,\nUlysses, at a nod from Ajax, drank to Achilles’ health, and then told him\nof the sore need of the Greeks, pressed by the Trojans. If he did not come\nto their aid, he whose very name frightened the enemy, the time would\nsurely come when he would greatly lament his idleness.",
        "Achilles’ passion, the greater for its fifteen days’ repression, burst\nforth in his reply: “I will say what I have in my heart,” he cried, “since\nconcealment is hateful to me. What thanks does the victor in countless\nbattles gain? He and the idler are equally honored, and die the same\ndeath. Many nights’ slumber have I lost on the battle field; many cities\nhave I conquered, abroad and here upon the Trojan coast, and of the spoil,\nthe greater part has gone to Agamemnon, who sat idle in his fleet; yet\nfrom me, who suffered much in fighting, he took my prize, my dearly loved\nBriseis; now let him keep her. Let him learn for himself how to conquer\nHector,–this Hector, who, when I went out against him, was afraid to\nleave the shelter of the Scaean gates. To-morrow, if you but watch, you\nwill see my galleys sailing upon the Hellespont on our return to Phthia.\nEvil was the hour in which I left its fertile coasts for this barren\nshore, where my mother Thetis foretold I should win deathless renown but\nbitter death.",
        "“Tell Agamemnon that I will never wed a child of his. On my return to\nPhthia my father will select a bride for me with whom, on his broad\nfields, I can live the life I have dreamed of.”",
        "The entreaties of the aged Phoenix, who had helped to rear Achilles, and\nhis arguments against his mercilessness, were of no avail; neither were\nthe words of Ajax. However, he at last sent the message that he would\nremain by the sea watching the course of the war, and that he would\nencounter Hector whenever he approached to set fire to the galleys of the\nMyrmidons.",
        "That night sleep did not visit the eyes of Agamemnon. Long he reflected on\nthe reply of Achilles, and wondered at the watch fires on the plain before\nTroy. The other chiefs were likewise full of anxiety, and when Nestor\noffered a reward to any one who would go as a spy to the Trojan camp,\nDiomed quickly volunteered. Selecting the wary Ulysses as his companion,\nhe stole forth to where the Trojans sat around their camp fires. The pair\nintercepted and slew Dolon the spy, and finding Rhesus and his Thracian\nband wrapped in slumber, slew the king with twelve of his chiefs, and\ncarried away his chariot and horses.",
        "Encouraged by this bold deed, the Greeks went forth to battle the next\nmorning. Fortune still favored the Trojans, however, and many Greeks fell\nby the hand of Hector, until he was checked by Ulysses and Diomed. In the\nfight, Agamemnon was wounded, and Diomed, Ulysses, and Machaon. And when\nAchilles from his tent saw the physician borne back from battle wounded,\nin the chariot of Nestor, he sent Patroclus to inquire of his injury.\nNestor sent word that Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed, Machaon, and Eurypylus\nwere wounded; perhaps these tidings would induce Achilles to forget his\ngrievances, and once more go forth to battle. If not, he urged Patroclus\nto beseech Achilles to permit him, Patroclus, to go forth with the\nMyrmidons, clad in Achilles’ armor, and strike terror to the hearts of the\nTrojans.",
        "The Trojans, encouraged by their success, pushed forward to the trench\nwhich the Greeks had dug around the wall thrown up before the ships, and,\nleaving their chariots on the brink, went on foot to the gates. After a\nlong struggle,–because the Trojans could not break down the wall and the\nGreeks could not drive back the Trojans,–Hector seized a mighty stone, so\nlarge that two men could scarcely lift it, and bearing it in one hand,\nbattered the bolted gates until they gave way with a crash; and the\nTrojans sprang within, pursuing the affrighted Greeks to the ships.",
        "From the heights of Olympus the gods kept a strict watch on the battle;\nand as soon as Neptune discovered that Jove, secure in the belief that no\ndeity would interfere with the successful Trojans, had turned away his\neyes, he went to the aid of the Greeks. Juno, also, furious at the sight\nof the Greeks who had fallen before the mighty Hector, determined to turn\nthe attention of Jove until Neptune had had an opportunity to assist the\nGreeks. Jove sat upon the peaks of Mount Ida, and thither went Juno, after\nrendering herself irresistible by borrowing the cestus of Venus. Jove,\ndelighted with the appearance of his wife, and still further won by her\ntender words and caresses, thought no longer of the armies fighting at the\nGrecian wall.",
        "Great was his anger when, after a time, he again looked towards Troy and\nsaw that Neptune had employed his time in aiding the Greeks, and that\nHector had been wounded by Ajax. By his orders Neptune was quickly\nrecalled, Hector was healed by Apollo, and the Trojans, strengthened again\nby Jupiter, drove back the Greeks to the ships, and attempted to set fire\nto the fleet.",
        "Seeing the Greeks in such desperate straits, Achilles at last gave his\nconsent that Patroclus should put on his armor, take his Myrmidons, and\ndrive the Trojans from the ships, stipulating, however, that he should\nreturn when this was done, and not follow the Trojans in their flight to\nTroy.",
        "The appearance of the supposed Achilles struck fear to the hearts of the\nTrojans, and Patroclus succeeded in driving them from the fleet and in\nslaying Sarpedon. Intoxicated by his success, he forgot Achilles’ warning,\nand pursued the fleeing Trojans to the walls of Troy. The strength of the\nTrojans was not sufficient to cope with that of Patroclus; and Troy would\nhave been taken had not Apollo stood upon a tower to thrust him down each\ntime he attempted to scale the walls. At last Hector and Patroclus\nencountered each other, and fought furiously. Seeing the peril of Hector,\nApollo smote Patroclus’s helmet off, broke his spear, and loosed his\nbuckler. Still undaunted, the hero fought until he fell, and died with the\nboasting words of Hector in his ears.",
        "Speedily the swift-footed Antilochus conveyed to Achilles the tidings of\nhis friend’s death. Enveloped in “a black cloud of sorrow,” Achilles\nrolled in the dust and lamented for his friend until warned by Iris that\nthe enemy were about to secure Patroclus’s body. Then, without armor,–for\nHector had secured that of Patroclus and put it on,–he hastened to the\ntrench, apart from the other Greeks, and shouted thrice, until the men of\nTroy, panic-stricken, fell back in disorder, and the body of his friend\nwas carried away by the triumphant Greeks.",
        "Through the long night the Achaians wept over Patroclus; but deeper than\ntheir grief was the sorrow of Achilles, for he had promised Menoetius to\nbring back his son in honor, laden with spoils, and now the barren coast\nof Troy would hold the ashes of both. Then Achilles made a solemn vow not\nto celebrate the funeral rites of Patroclus until he brought to him the\nhead and arms of Hector, and had captured on the field twelve Trojan\nyouths to slaughter on his funeral pile. The hated Hector slain and\nPatroclus’s funeral rites celebrated, he cared not for the future. The\nfate his mother had foretold did not daunt him. Since, by his own folly,\nhis dearest friend had been taken from him, the sooner their ashes rested\ntogether the better. If he was not to see the rich fields of Phthia, his\nwas to be, at least, a deathless renown.",
        "To take the place of the arms which Hector had taken from Patroclus,\nVulcan, at Thetis’s request, had fashioned for Achilles the most beautiful\narmor ever worn by man. Brass, tin, silver, and gold composed the bright\ncorselet, the solid helm, and the wondrous shield, adorned with such\npictures as no mortal artist ever wrought.",
        "After having feasted his eyes on this beautiful armor, whose clanking\nstruck terror even to the hearts of the Myrmidons, Achilles sought out the\nGreeks and Agamemnon, and in the assembly acknowledged his fault. “Let\nthese things belong to the dead past,” said he. “My wrath is done. Let us\nnow stir the long-haired Greeks to war.”",
        "“Fate, not I, was the cause of our trouble,” replied Agamemnon. “The\ngoddess of discord created the dissension, that Até who troubled even the\ngods on Olympus until expelled by Jupiter. But I will make amends with\nliberal gifts.”",
        "Peace having been made between the chiefs, Achilles returned to his tent\nwithout partaking of the banquet spread by Agamemnon, as he had vowed not\nto break his fast until he had avenged his friend. Agamemnon’s gifts were\ncarried to the tents of Achilles by the Myrmidons, and with them went\nBriseis, who, when she saw the body of Patroclus, threw herself upon it\nand wept long for the one whose kindness to her–whose lot had been sorrow\nupon sorrow–she could never forget. All the women mourned, seemingly for\nPatroclus, really for their own griefs. Achilles likewise wept, until,\nstrengthened by Pallas, he hastened to put his armor on and urge the\nGreeks to battle.",
        "As he mounted his chariot he spoke thus to his fleet steeds, Xanthus and\nBalius: “Bring me back when the battle is over, I charge you, my noble\nsteeds. Leave me not on the field, as you left Patroclus.”",
        "Then Xanthus, with the long-flowing mane, endowed with power of speech by\nJuno, thus spake: “This day, at least, we will bring thee home, Achilles;\nbut the hour of thy death is nigh, and, since the fates have decreed it,\nwe could not save thee, were we swift as the winged winds. Nor was it\nthrough fault of ours that Patroclus fell.”",
        "Angry at the reminder of his doom, Achilles drove hurriedly to the field,\ndetermined to fight until he had made the Trojans sick of war.",
        "Knowing that the war was drawing rapidly to a close, Jupiter gave\npermission to the gods to take part in it, and a terrible combat ensued.\nJuno, Pallas, Neptune, Hermes, and Vulcan went to the fleet of the Greeks,\nwhile Mars, Apollo, Diana, Latona, Venus, and Xanthus arrayed themselves\nwith the Trojans. When the gods joined in the combat and Neptune shook the\nearth and Jupiter thundered from above, there was such tumult in the air\nthat even the dark god of the underworld was terrified. In the battle of\nthe gods, Apollo encountered Neptune, Pallas fought against Mars, Diana\nand Juno opposed each other, Hermes was pitted against Latona, and Xanthus\nor Scamander, the river god, strove against Vulcan. It was not long before\nJupiter’s fear was realized, and the mortals needed the aid of the gods.\nÆneas, encouraged by Apollo to confront Achilles, was rescued only by the\nintervention of Neptune, who, remembering that it was the will of fate\nthat Æneas should be spared to perpetuate the Dardan race, snatched him\naway in a cloud, although he was himself aiding the Greeks.",
        "Mad with rage and spattered with blood, Achilles pursued the flying\nTrojans about the plain, sparing none except the twelve youths who were to\nbe butchered on the funeral pile of Patroclus. He stood in the river,\nfilling it with slaughtered bodies until, indignant at the insults offered\nhim, the river god Scamander caused his waters to rush after Achilles so\nthat he fled for his life. Far across the plain it chased him, and was\nonly stopped by the fires of Vulcan, summoned by Juno.",
        "By an artifice of Apollo, Achilles was decoyed away from the gates of Troy\nlong enough to allow the Trojans to enter. Hector, however, stayed\nwithout, unmoved by the prayers of Priam and Hecuba. Too late he saw his\nerror in not heeding the advice of Polydamas to keep within the walls\nafter the re-appearance of Achilles; he feared the reproaches of the\nTrojan warriors and dames, and determined to meet his fate, whatever it\nmight be. Even death at the hands of Achilles would be preferable to the\ninsults and reproaches that might await him within the walls.",
        "When he saw Achilles approach in his god-given armor, fear seized the\nnoble Hector, and he fled from his enemy. Thrice around the walls he fled,\nAchilles pursuing, and the gods looked down from heaven in sorrow, for,\naccording to the decrees of fate, Hector must fall this day by the hand of\nAchilles. To hasten the combat, Pallas assumed the form of Hector’s\nbrother Deiphobus, and stood by his side, encouraging him to turn and meet\nhis foe.",
        "Hector soon perceived the deception, but boldly faced Achilles, who sprang\nat him, brandishing his awful spear. Quickly stooping, Hector avoided the\nweapon and hurled his spear at Achilles. It was an unequal conflict. The\narmor of Achilles was weapon proof, and Pallas stood at his elbow to\nreturn to him his weapons. Achilles knew well the weak spots in his old\narmor worn by Hector, and selecting a seam unguarded by the shield, he\ngave Hector a mortal wound, and insulted him as he lay dying at his feet.",
        "Tears and wailing filled the city as the Trojans watched the combat; and\ndespair fell upon them when they saw the body of Hector fastened to the\nchariot of Achilles and dragged thrice around the Trojan walls. From her\nchamber where she sat weaving, unaware of the mortal combat waged before\nthe walls, Andromache came forth to see great Hector fallen and his corpse\ninsulted by his enemy.",
        "While Priam sat in his palace with dust strewn on his head, and the\nwailings of the women filled the streets of Troy, the Greeks were\nhastening to their camps to celebrate the funeral rites of Patroclus,\nwhose body had been saved from corruption by Thetis. A massive funeral\npile was constructed of wood brought from the forests on Mount Ida. The\nchiefs in their chariots and thousands of men on foot followed the body of\nPatroclus. The comrades of the dead warrior cut off their long hair and\nstrewed it on the dead, and Achilles sheared his yellow hair and placed\nthe locks in Patroclus’s hands. He had suffered the flowing curls to grow\nlong because of a vow made by his father to the river Sperchius that he\nwould sacrifice these locks to him on his son’s return home, a useless\nvow, since now he was to lose his life by this dark blue sea.",
        "Next the sacrifice was offered, many fatlings of the flock, and countless\noxen, noble steeds, dogs, jars of honey, and lastly the bodies of the\ntwelve Trojan youths were heaped upon the fire.",
        "After the flames had consumed the pile, Achilles and his friends quenched\nthe ashes with red wine, and gathered the bones of Patroclus in a golden\nvase which Achilles commanded his friends not to bury until he, too, fell\nbefore Troy, that their ashes might be mingled and buried under one mound\nby the remaining Greeks.",
        "After the funeral rites were celebrated, the funeral games were held, in\nwhich the warriors vied with each other in chariot racing, boxing,\nwrestling, foot racing, throwing the spear, and archery.",
        "So ended the funeral of Patroclus, and the gods, looking down from heaven,\nsorrowed for Hector, whose corpse Achilles was treating with such\nindignity, intending that the dogs should destroy it. The gods had kept\nthe body unstained, and now they determined to soften Achilles’ heart,\nthat he might restore it to Priam.",
        "Iris descended from heaven, and standing at the side of Priam as he sat\nwith dust-strewn head, in his palace halls, gave him Jove’s command that\nhe should take gifts and visit Achilles, to ransom Hector’s body. Heeding\nnot the prayers of Hecuba, Priam gathered together whatever was most\nchoice, talents of pure gold, beautiful goblets, handsome robes and\ntunics, and seating himself in his polished car, drawn by strong-hoofed\nmules, set forth unaccompanied save by an aged herald. Above him soared\nJove’s eagle, in token of the god’s protection.",
        "Priam had not gone far when he met Mercury in the guise of a Greek youth,\nwho guided him unseen through the slumbering Greek lines to the tent of\nAchilles.",
        "The hero was just finishing his repast when the old king entered, fell on\nhis knees, kissed the cruel hands that had slain so many of his sons, and\nprayed him to give up the body of his loved Hector in return for the\nransom he had brought with him. Achilles, recognizing the fact that Priam\nhad made his way there uninjured only by the assistance and protection of\nsome god, and touched by the thought of his own aged father, whom he\nshould never again gladden by his return to Phthia, granted the request,\nand bade Priam seat himself at the table and banquet with him. He also\ngranted a twelve days’ truce for the celebration of the funeral rites of\nHector, and then invited Priam to pass the night in his tent. Warned by\nMercury, Priam rose early in the morning, and, unseen by the Greeks,\nconveyed Hector’s body back to Troy.",
        "When the polished car of Priam entered the city of Troy, great were the\nlamentations and wailings over the body of Hector. Hecuba and Andromache\nvied with each other in the bitterness of their grief, and Helen lamented\nbecause the only friend she had in Troy had departed, and no one who\nremained would be kind to her.",
        "During the twelve days granted as a truce, wood was brought from Ida, and\nthe funeral rites of Hector were celebrated as befitted the son of a great\nking.",
