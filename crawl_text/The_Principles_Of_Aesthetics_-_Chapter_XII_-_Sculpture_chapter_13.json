        "The sculptor has this advantage over all other artists, that his chief\nsubject is the most beautiful thing in the world–the human body. In\ntwo ways the body is supremely beautiful: as an expression of mind and\nas an embodiment of sensuous charm. In the body mind has become actually\nincarnate; there purpose, emotion, and thought have taken shape and\nmanifestation. And this shape, through its appeal to the amorous,\nparental, and gregarious feelings, and through the complete organization\nof its parts, has no rival in loveliness. What wonder, therefore, that\nsculptors have always thought of their work as simply one of mere\nimitation of nature, the divine. Yet in sculpture, as in the other\narts, the imitative process is never slavish, but selective and\ninventive. For the body is interesting to the artist only in so far\nas it is beautiful, that is, so far as it has charm and exhibits the\ncontrol of mind; some of its details and many of its attitudes, having\nno relation to either, are unfit for imitation; and, although inspired\nby his model, the sculptor seeks to create out of his impressions a\nstill more harmonious object.",
        "To give to his material the semblance of the body beautiful is the\ntechnical problem of the sculptor. Although this semblance is primarily\nfor sight, it is not exclusively so. For in sculpture shape is not\ntwo-dimensional, but plastic; and for the full appreciation of\nplasticity, the cooperation of touch is required. Moreover, not only\nthe perception of the form, but also a large part of the appreciation\nof the charm of the body depends upon touch. Of course we do not\nordinarily touch statues, but they should make us want to touch them,\nand we should touch them–in the imagination. The surfaces of the\nstatue should therefore be so modeled as to give us, in the imagination,\nthe pleasures that we get when we touch the living body. It is well\nknown that these touch values were destroyed by the neo-classicists\nwhen they polished the surfaces of their statues. Such sculpture for\nthe eye only is almost as good when reproduced in an engraving that\npreserves its visual quality, and is therefore lacking in complete\nsculptural beauty. But no plane reproduction can replace the best\nGreek, Italian, or French work.",
        "The life of the statue should, however, be more than skin deep. We\nshould appreciate it through sensations of motion and strain as well\nas through sight and touch, feeling the tenseness or relaxation of the\nmuscles and tendons beneath. We should move with its motion or rest\nwith its repose. And this does not mean that we should merely know\nthat an attitude of quiet or of motion is represented; we should\nactually experience quiet or motion. In our own bodies sensations\ncorresponding to these should be awakened by the visual image of the\nstatue, yet should be fused with the latter, becoming for our perception\nits, not ours, in accordance with the mechanism of einfuhlung\ndescribed in our fourth chapter. The light rhythmic motion of the\nfigures in Carpeaux’s “Dance” should thrill in our own limbs, yet seem\nto thrill in theirs.",
        "Because it preserves the full three-dimensional presence of the body,\nsculpture is, next to the drama, the most realistic of the arts. This\nrealism is not, however, an unmixed advantage for general appreciation.\nFor, finding the shape of the body, men sometimes demand its color and\nlife, complaining that the statue is cold and dead; [Footnote: See\nByron, Don Juan, Canto II, cxviii.] or else, giving life to the\nform, they react to it practically and socially, as they would toward\nthe real body. Yet, for the one attitude, the art itself cannot be\nheld responsible, but rather some want of genius in the artist or lack\nof imagination in the spectator; and as for the other, although only\na bloodless dogma would demand the elimination of passion and interest\nfrom the appreciation of sculpture–for unless the marble arouse the\nnatural feelings toward the body it is no successful\nexpression–nevertheless, good taste does demand that, through attention\nto form and a sense of the unreality of the object, these feelings be\nsubdued to contemplation.",
        "In order to keep the statue on the ideal plane, it should not be too\nrealistically fashioned. If it looks too much like a man, we shall\nfirst treat it as a man, as we do one of Jarley’s or Mme. Tissaud’s\nwaxworks, and then after we have been undeceived, we shall have toward\nit an uncanny feeling, totally unaesthetic, as towards a corpse. The\nstatue, therefore, if life-sized, should not be given the colors or\nclothing of life. Tinting is not excluded, provided no attempt is made\nat exact imitation; and when the statue is of heroic, or less than the\nnormal size, as in porcelain, both coloring and clothing may be more\nrealistic. No hard and fast rules can be formulated; yet the principle\nis plain–there should be realism in one aspect, above all in shape,\nin order that there may be an aesthetic semblance of life, but not in\nall, in order that the statue may not be a mere substitute for life,\nawakening the reactions appropriate to life. Moreover, appreciating\nthe beauty of his material, the sculptor may not wish to cover it up,\nas he would if he tinted it. As in painting, the attainment of beauty\nin the medium may interfere with full realism in execution. For the\nsake of beauty of color, the worker in bronze will be content to see\nthe white man black, and for the sake of beauty of line he may even\nsacrifice something of exactness in the rendering of shape.",
        "For there is a beauty in the media of sculpture, apart from what they\nmay represent, quite as real, if not as obvious, as in the other arts.\nAnd without this beauty, there is no artistic sculpture. Its subtlety\ndoes not diminish its importance or its effect upon our feeling, for\nit makes all the difference between a mere imitation of nature and a\nwork of art charming and compelling. We do not need to recognize its\nexistence explicitly in order to appreciate it; yet, as soon as our\nattention is called to it, we admit it and accord to it that rare\ninfluence which before was felt but nameless.",
        "In the first place, the color of the material is expressive. The black\nand gold of bronze have a depth and intensity, the whiteness of marble\na coldness, clarity, and, serenity, inescapable. The weight and\nhardness, or lightness and softness, of the material, also count. If\npeople do not feel the expressiveness of these qualities directly,\nthey nevertheless do feel it indirectly, whenever they appreciate the\nsuperior fitness of marble and bronze for the embodiment of the heroic\nand supernatural, and of the light and fragile porcelain for the more\nfleeting and trivial phases of life. Size, too, is expressive. There\nis a daintiness and tenderness about a little statue, contrasting\nstrongly with the grandeur and majesty of one of heroic size. The usual\nsmall size of the terra cotta figurines among the Greeks was appropriate\nfor the genre subjects which they so frequently represented, and an\nAphrodite in this material is rather the Earthly than the Heavenly\nLove.",
        "There is also an evident beauty of line in sculpture, similar to the\nbeauty of line in painting. The curved line is expressive of movement\nand grace; the horizontal, of repose; the crooked line, of energy and\nconflict. Compare, from this point of view, Rodin’s “The Aged Helmet-\nMaker’s Wife” with his “Danaid,\"–how expressive of struggle and\nsuffering are the uneven lines of the former, how voluptuous the curves\nof the latter! Michelangelo is the great example of the use of tortuous\nlines for the expression of conflict. Undulating vertical lines are\nlargely responsible for the “grace and dignity” of the classic\nsculpture.",
        "There is an organic unity of line in sculpture, similar again to that\nin painting. And by line I mean not only surface lines, but the lines\nmade by the planes in which the body lies, the lines of pose and\nattitude. The predominance of a single type of line, the union of many\nlines to form a single continuous line, balance and symmetry of line,\nproportion of length and parallelism, are all to be found in sculpture.\nEspecially important is rhythm–the harmonious, balanced movement of\nlines. In the “Venus de Milo,” for example, the plane of the lower\nlimbs from the feet to the knees moves to the left; there is an opposite\nand balancing movement from the right knee to the waist; the first\nmovement is repeated in the parallel line from the right hip to the\ntop of the head; this, in turn, is balanced by a line in the opposite\ndirection running from the left hip to the right shoulder, parallel\nto the second line; but the equilibrium of line is not a rigid one,\nfor the body as a whole moves in an undulating line to the left,\nimparting grace and a total unity.",
        "The beauty of line in sculpture is, of course, no invention of the\nartist; for nature has created it in the body itself. The sculptor\ntakes this beauty as the basis of his work, remodeling only by the\nelimination of details, through which purer effects of line are\nobtained, or by the selection and emphasis of pose, through which these\neffects are rendered more intensely expressive. All conventionalization\nis in the interest of increased beauty of line. But too great a\nsacrifice of the natural contours of the body, as in some of the work\nof the Cubists, results in a lifelessness that cannot be atoned for\nby any formal beauty.",
        "The unification of line in sculpture is a matter not only of lines\nwithin the whole and of single contours, but of the total visual form\nof the whole, of silhouette. Although three-dimensional, every statue\ncasts a two-dimensional image on the retina. It makes as many of these\nplane pictures as there are points of view from which it can be seen.\nOne can easily convince oneself of this by viewing a statue from a\ndistance, when it will flatten out to a mere outline or silhouette.\nAs such, it should be clear and simple and pleasing, capable of being\ngrasped as a whole irrespective of detail. Michelangelo demanded that\nevery statue be capable of being put inside of some simple geometrical\nfigure, like a pyramid or a cube; that there be no wayward arms or\nlegs, but close attachment to the body, so close that the statue might\nbe rolled down hill without any part being broken off. This last is\nperhaps too rigorous a requirement, but the best work of all periods\nexhibits visual clarity and concentration. [Footnote: Compare Adolf\nHildebrand, The Problem of Form in Painting and Sculpture.]",
        "Within its contours the statue stands alone. This is the essential\ndifference between painting and sculpture; the painted thing is always\na part of a larger spatial whole within which it exists in relation\nto other things, while the sculptured thing exists by itself; the space\nof the statue is the space which it fills; there is no further space\nto which it belongs, no background in which it lies. The space of\nsculpture, like the space of painting, is of course a represented or\nimaginary space, to be carefully distinguished from the real space of\nthe room in which it is placed and the floor upon which it stands. The\npedestal serves the same purpose in sculpture as the frame in the\nsister art; it cuts off the ideal space which the statue fills from\nthe real space where it is housed, raising it above the common ground\nof real life, with its practical and social attitudes, into the realm\nof contemplation. The pedestal should be of a different material from\nthe statue, else it belongs with the latter, and fails to perform its\nseparating junction. The plate, on the other hand, should be of the\nsame material, otherwise the statue would be made to stand on our\nearth, and in the same space with us.",
        "However, just as in painting every object should be represented as\nbelonging to a wider whole of space, so in sculpture, every part of\nthe body should be represented as belonging to the whole body. If,\ntherefore, only a part of the body is sculptured, it should be evident\nthat it is a part and not the whole. In the portrait statue, for\nexample, if the head alone is represented, there should appear, along\nwith the head, as much of the bust as will suggest attachment to the\nbody, in order that it may not seem decapitated! It is because the\ntorso is so obviously a fragment of an ideal whole that we do not feel\nit to be an uncanny mutilation of a man or woman. In its present\ncondition, the “Venus de Milo” is not the statue of an armless woman,\nbut a statue of part of a whole woman.",
        "A statue is not sufficiently unified by representing a single individual\nor several individuals united by some common interest or by\nparticipation in some common action; the unity in the object should\nbe expressed through a unity in the material of representation. The\nfinest taste requires that every statue should be made of only one\nkind of material. One part, say the body, should not be of marble, and\nanother part, say the girdle, of gold or bronze. Such a combination\nof materials gives the impression of two things juxtaposed, not of a\nsingle whole. If in defense of this one were to say that through the\ndifference of materials real differences in the object are portrayed,\nconsistency would require that the principle be carried out, that the\nhair be of another material, and the eyes of still a third, with the\nresult of making the statue a sheer agglomerate. And when more than\none individual is represented, even a unity of material is not\nsufficient; it is necessary, in addition, that the several figures in\nthe group be in contact with each Other. It is not enough that they\nstand on the same plate; for the real empty space that we see between\nthem will keep them apart. The ideal space to which they belong, and\nthe spiritual or dramatic oneness, should be mediated by a material\ntouch of hands or other parts of the body. Compare, in this connection,\nRodin’s “Citizens of Calais” where this principle is violated, with\nthe three figures from the summit of his “Hell Gate,” where it is\nobserved. In the former we simply know that the figures belong together,\nbut we do not feel them as together. [Footnote: Compare Lipps,\nAesthetik, Bd. 2, Fuenftes Kapitel.]",
        "In the normal type of sculpture only one figure is represented. For\nthis, there is, perhaps, a chief point of regard, in front, the same\nas that which we ordinarily occupy with reference to our fellow men.\nYet, since the body is beautiful from every point of view, the statue,\nunless designed to fit into a niche, should be so made that we shall\nwant to move around it and survey it from every angle. Here is another\ndifference between painting and sculpture. In the group, however, where\nseveral figures are represented united by some common interest or by\nparticipating in some common action, this difference is already\nbeginning to disappear. For, in order to appreciate the dramatic\nsignificance of the group, the point of regard from in front is\nessential. The other aspects remain important for their corporeal\nbeauty, but, since that is not ordinarily paired with an equal inner\nsignificance, they come to acquire a secondary place.",
        "Impressionistic sculpture represents a further departure from the\nnormal and in the direction of the pictorial. Here part of the block\nfrom which the statue has been hewn is left an integral member of the\npiece; and out of it the figure seems to grow, as it were. It performs\nin the whole a function corresponding to the background of a\nportrait–the representation of the environment. Thus, in Meunier’s\n“The Miner,” the block represents the mine; in Rodin’s “Orpheus and\nEurydice,” it represents the mouth of Hades; in his “Mystery of the\nSpring,” a basin. Through the possibility of thus representing the\nrelation of man to his environment a notable extension in the scope\nof sculpture is obtained.",
        "When a background is introduced, the figure or figures, being members\nof a larger whole, require less detailed treatment, less clearness of\noutline. Their parts may even be left in large measure unfinished, the\ncontours melting together with the block. A special point of regard,\nfrom which alone the figures are modeled, is obviously essential.\nStriking is the contrast of this type with the classic, where the\nutmost precision in modeling is necessary. Along with the diminished\nemphasis on clearness of form goes an increased effort at the portrayal\nof the inner, more spiritual life; sentiment and mystery find an\nunwonted place in the art. Rodin’s “Psyche” is a good illustration.\nYet, despite these differences, the classic demand for living surfaces,\nfor rhythmical lines, for perspicuity and totality of silhouette, for\nsingleness and unity of material, abides.",
        "However, when the block attains prominence, the unification of the\ndifferent figures through contact is no longer of equal necessity. The\nbackground serves the purpose of bringing the figures together, of\nproviding a material bond between them. This is especially true in the\nvarious kinds of relief, between which and sculpture in the round,\nimpressionistic sculpture is a sort of compromise. In relief there may\neven be a representation of perspective, the figures seeming to lie\nbehind each other, flatter and smaller to indicate distance. But we\nshall not enter into the technique of this, which obviously approaches\nthat of painting.",
        "When the charm of the body is the prime object of expression, those\nactions and poses which exhibit grace and vigor are the ones naturally\nchosen. This beauty is best revealed in the single figure, because in\nthe group there is usually some dramatic interest which diverts\nattention from it. The figure is preferably wholly or partially\nundraped, or when drapery is used, it should reveal the body underneath\nand possess beauty of line of its own. Elaboration of drapery for its\nown sake, or in order to display virtuosity in modeling, shows lack\nof true sculptural vision, which always has its eye on the naked form.\nAside from lack of charm, the old and crippled are avoided because\ntheir inharmonious lines would appear again in a statue which reproduced\nthem; it is not possible, as in painting, to make a harmony out of\nthem through relation to other lines in the total work, for no other\nlines exist; nor can their natural ugliness be so easily made acceptable\nthrough beauty of color and light. Nevertheless, no one can dogmatically\nassert that the artist must confine himself in his choice of subjects.\nIf by harmonizing the distorted lines of an ugly body with each other,\nand by enhancing the given purity and expressiveness of his material,\nthe artist can create a beauty of form overlying the repellence of the\nsubject, and if he can make us feel the tragedy or pathos of age and\ndisease, no one can gainsay his work. In his “Aged Helmet-Maker’s\nWife,” Rodin has perhaps accomplished this.  [Footnote: See Rodin’s own\ndefense of this statue in his L’Art, chap. II.]",
        "In the classic sculpture the expression of the inner life is subordinate\nto the expression of corporeal beauty. Or, so far as mind is revealed,\nthe revelation occurs through the body as a whole,–through attitude\nand pose and act. In this way complete unity between the inner and the\nouter beauty is preserved. For when through subtle modeling of the\nface the expression of the intense and individualized life of thought\nis attempted, the beauties of soul and body tend to fall apart and\nbecome rivals for attention. In classic sculpture, therefore, the face\nis rightly somewhat inexpressive, or better, is expressive of only the\nbroad and typical human emotions. Fine or deep qualities may, however,\nbe expressed; for dignity, poise, intelligence, sorrow, and active joy\nmake themselves manifest in the total habitus of the body no less than\nin the face.",
        "The work of Michelangelo is a further proof that sculpture can express\nthe spiritual life, not only in the face, but in the body also. The\nexpression there is no different in essential kind from that found in\nthe heroic classic sculpture. It is universal, typical, not individual,\npersonal; of the gods, not of men. Its quality alone differs; it is\nmonstrous, pathological, grandiose, instead of serene and happily\nbalanced.",
        "But sculpture can also portray the individualized psychic life.\n [Footnote: Consult the discussion in Rodin’s L’Art, chap. VII.]\nFor this, the portrait bust is the most appropriate medium of\nexpression. By separating the head, the natural seat of mind, from the\nrest of the body, the rivalry between the beauty of soul and form is\nobviated. How much sculpture can do in this way is shown by the work\nof the Greeks and Romans in ancient times, and by such men as Houdon\nand Rodin among the moderns. Think of the intense and concentrated\nexpression of thought and emotion in the “Voltaire” of Houdon and the\n“Dalou” of Rodin! Success depends largely upon the modeling of the\nsubtle lines of the face, where the more highly specialized workings\nof the mind leave their impress. Whatever of character the face may\nexpress can be expressed over again in its image. Of course the unique\nresponses of mind to definite situations, such as, for example, the\nconversation of a man with his fellows, cannot be portrayed in\nsculpture, which isolates the individual. But the characteristic mood\nand attitude, the permanent residuum and condition of these responses,\ncan be portrayed; and this constitutes personality or character. As\nSchopenhauer declared, the character of a man is better revealed in\nthe face when he is in repose than when he is responding to other men,\nfor there is always a certain amount of dissimulation or insincerity\nin social intercourse. The impossibility of rendering the color and\nanimation of the eye constitutes a real deficiency, but, as has often\nbeen pointed out, this is partly minimized through the fact that the\nexpression of the eye depends largely upon the brows; by itself, the\neye is inexpressive. The portrait statue has much the same purpose as\nthe bust, and hence should be draped. The heroic, equestrian statue,\nhowever, expresses rather the imposing, socially perceptible side of\nthe man, than the inner life of thought and sentiment revealed in the\nbust.",
        "The development of sculpture has produced nothing more beautiful than\nthe solitaire statues which the Greeks have left us; and when we think\nof Greek sculpture we usually have in mind these marble or bronze\nimages of gods and heroes. But we should not forget the figurines of\nterra cotta, a genre sculpture, representing men and women in the acts\nand attitudes of daily life, at work and at play. The ideal of sculpture\nshould not be pitched too high. There is no reason why, with the example\nset by the Greeks, sculpture should not portray the lighter and more\nusual phases of human life. If sculpture is to strike new paths, and\nbe something more than a repetition of classical models, it must become\nmore realistic. And, as we have already noted, by making use of the\nblock as a sort of background, even some relation of man to his\nenvironment can be represented. Through the group the simpler relations\nof man with his fellows–comradeship, love, conflict, or common\naction–can be expressed; although the power of sculpture is greatly\nlimited in this direction. Sculpture is often taxed by people who\nemphasize the importance of the political and industrial mechanism\nwith inability to portray large groups of men and the more complex\nrelations arising out of the dependence of man upon nature and society.\nBut one may well urge the compensating worth which sculpture will\nalways possess of recalling men to a sense of the value and beauty of\nthe individual as such, especially in an age like our own where they\ntend to be forgotten.",
        "The principles that apply to the use of historical, literary, and\nsymbolic themes in painting hold with increased force in sculpture.\nWe must admit the right of the sculptor to illustrate simple and\nwell-known historical or fictitious situations. At the same time,\nhowever, we must remember that a work of this kind is subject to a\ntwofold standard: first and indispensable, the sculptural, is the form\nanimate and beautiful; then, are the life and action appropriate to\nthe idea? The first is alone absolutely unequivocal. The second, on\nthe other hand, is largely relative; for unless the sculptor has carried\nout the idea in so masterly a fashion that we can think of no other\npossibility–as Phidias is said to have done with his statue of\nZeus–there must always be something arbitrary about any particular\nrepresentation. This arbitrary element is increased in symbolic\nsculpture. You can perhaps depict an actual or fictitious human\nsituation by means of sculptured bodies and make your image seem\ninevitable; but how can you make bodies the vehicles of abstractions?\nMoreover, sculpture is a realistic art; it presents us with the\nsemblance of living forms, and if these forms are monstrous or are\nshown accomplishing impossible things, they cannot escape a certain\naspect of the ridiculous. I have in mind Rodin’s “Man and His Thought.\"\nIf the man were only represented fashioning the figure with his hands,\nhis hands guided by his thought; but the hands are inactive, and the\nfigure grows by thought alone! Or consider “The Hand of God” by the\nsame artist. To say that we are in the hands of God is a good\nmetaphorical way of expressing our dependence upon the Destiny that\nshapes our ends; but it is another thing to exhibit us as actually\nenfolded by a hand.",
        "The more sensitive we are to the beauty of the body and of the mind,\nso far as manifest through the body, the better content we shall be\nwith normal sculpture and the less urgently we shall demand symbolism.\nOf course all statues may become symbolic, as all works of art may,\nin the sense of possessing a universal meaning won by generalizing\ntheir individual significance. Symbolic in this legitimate way were\nthe statues of the Greek gods; thus Aphrodite, who was lovely, became\nLove, and Athena, who was wise, became Wisdom. But there is nothing\narbitrary in such symbolism.",
