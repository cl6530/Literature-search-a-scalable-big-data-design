        "Abstract concepts, such as elasticity, voluminousness,\ndisconnectedness, are salient aspects of our concrete experiences\nwhich we find it useful to single out. Useful, because we are then\nreminded of other things that offer those same aspects; and, if the\naspects carry consequences in those other things, we can return to\nour first things, expecting those same consequences to accrue.",
        "To be helped to anticipate consequences is always a gain, and such\nbeing the help that abstract concepts give us, it is obvious that\ntheir use is fulfilled only when we get back again into concrete\nparticulars by their means, bearing the consequences in our minds,\nand enriching our notion of the original objects therewithal.",
        "Without abstract concepts to handle our perceptual particulars by,\nwe are like men hopping on one foot. Using concepts along with the\nparticulars, we become bipedal. We throw our concept forward, get a\nfoothold on the consequence, hitch our line to this, and draw\nour percept up, travelling thus with a hop, skip and jump over the\nsurface of life at a vastly rapider rate than if we merely waded\nthrough the thickness of the particulars as accident rained\nthem down upon our heads. Animals have to do this, but men raise\ntheir heads higher and breathe freely in the upper conceptual air.",
        " The enormous esteem professed by all philosophers for the\nconceptual form of consciousness is easy to understand. From Plato’s\ntime downwards it has been held to be our sole avenue to essential\ntruth. Concepts are universal, changeless, pure; their relations\nare eternal; they are spiritual, while the concrete particulars\nwhich they enable us to handle are corrupted by the flesh. They are\nprecious in themselves, then, apart from their original use, and\nconfer new dignity upon our life.",
        "One can find no fault with this way of feeling about concepts so\nlong as their original function does not get swallowed up in\nthe admiration and lost. That function is of course to enlarge\nmentally our momentary experiences by ADDING to them the\nconsequences conceived; but unfortunately, that function is not only\ntoo often forgotten by philosophers in their reasonings, but is\noften converted into its exact opposite, and made a means of\ndiminishing the original experience by DENYING (implicitly or\nexplicitly) all its features save the one specially abstracted to\nconceive it by.",
        "This itself is a highly abstract way of stating my complaint, and it\nneeds to be redeemed from obscurity by showing instances of what is\nmeant. Some beliefs very dear to my own heart have been conceived in\nthis viciously abstract way by critics. One is the ’will\nto believe,’ so called; another is the indeterminism of certain\nfutures; a third is the notion that truth may vary with the\nstandpoint of the man who holds it. I believe that the perverse\nabuse of the abstracting function has led critics to employ false\narguments against these doctrines, and often has led their readers\nto false conclusions. I should like to try to save the situation, if\npossible, by a few counter-critical remarks.",
        "Let me give the name of ’vicious abstractionism’ to a way of using\nconcepts which may be thus described: We conceive a concrete\nsituation by singling out some salient or important feature in it,\nand classing it under that; then, instead of adding to its previous\ncharacters all the positive consequences which the new way of\nconceiving it may bring, we proceed to use our concept privatively;\nreducing the originally rich phenomenon to the naked suggestions of\nthat name abstractly taken, treating it as a case of ’nothing but’\nthat concept, and acting as if all the other characters from out of\nwhich the concept is abstracted were expunged. [Footnote: Let not\nthe reader confound the fallacy here described with legitimately\nnegative inferences such as those drawn in the mood ’celarent’ of\nthe logic-books.] Abstraction, functioning in this way, becomes a\nmeans of arrest far more than a means of advance in thought. It\nmutilates things; it creates difficulties and finds impossibilities;\nand more than half the trouble that metaphysicians and logicians\ngive themselves over the paradoxes and dialectic puzzles of the\nuniverse may, I am convinced, be traced to this relatively simple\nsource. THE VICIOUSLY PRIVATIVE EMPLOYMENT OF ABSTRACT CHARACTERS\nAND CLASS NAMES is, I am persuaded, one of the great original sins\nof the rationalistic mind.",
        "To proceed immediately to concrete examples, cast a glance at the\nbelief in ’free will,’ demolished with such specious\npersuasiveness recently by the skilful hand of Professor Fullerton.\n[Footnote: Popular Science Monthly, N. Y., vols. lviii and lix.]\nWhen a common man says that his will is free, what does he mean? He\nmeans that there are situations of bifurcation inside of his life in\nwhich two futures seem to him equally possible, for both have their\nroots equally planted in his present and his past. Either,\nif realized, will grow out of his previous motives, character and\ncircumstances, and will continue uninterruptedly the pulsations of\nhis personal life. But sometimes both at once are incompatible with\nphysical nature, and then it seems to the naive observer as if he\nmade a choice between them NOW, and that the question of which\nfuture is to be, instead of having been decided at the foundation of\nthe world, were decided afresh at every passing moment in I which\nfact seems livingly to grow, and possibility seems, in turning\nitself towards one act, to exclude all others.",
        "He who takes things at their face-value here may indeed be deceived.\nHe may far too often mistake his private ignorance of what\nis predetermined for a real indetermination of what is to be. Yet,\nhowever imaginary it may be, his picture of the situation offers no\nappearance of breach between the past and future. A train is the\nsame train, its passengers are the same passengers, its momentum is\nthe same momentum, no matter which way the switch which fixes its\ndirection is placed. For the indeterminist there is at all times\nenough past for all the different futures in sight, and\nmore besides, to find their reasons in it, and whichever future\ncomes will slide out of that past as easily as the train slides by\nthe switch. The world, in short, is just as CONTINUOUS WITH\nITSELF for the believers in free will as for the\nrigorous determinists, only the latter are unable to believe in\npoints of bifurcation as spots of really indifferent equilibrium or\nas containing shunts which there–and there only, NOT BEFORE–\n direct existing motions without altering their amount.",
        "Were there such spots of indifference, the rigorous determinists\nthink, the future and the past would be separated absolutely,\nfor, ABSTRACTLY TAKEN, THE WORD ’INDIFFERENT’ SUGGESTS DISCONNECTION\nSOLELY. Whatever is indifferent is in so far forth unrelated and\ndetached. Take the term thus strictly, and you see, they tell\nus, that if any spot of indifference is found upon the broad highway\nbetween the past and the future, then no connection of any sort\nwhatever, no continuous momentum, no identical passenger, no common\naim or agent, can be found on both sides of the shunt or\nswitch which there is moved. The place is an impassable chasm.",
        "Mr. Fullerton writes–the italics are mine–as follows:–",
        "’In so far as my action is free, what I have been, what I am, what I\nhave always done or striven to do, what I most earnestly wish\nor resolve to do at the present moment–these things can have NO\nMORE TO DO WITH ITS FUTURE REALIZATION THAN IF THEY HAD NO\nEXISTENCE.... The possibility is a hideous one; and surely even the\nmost ardent free-willist will, when he contemplates it frankly,\nexcuse me for hoping that if I am free I am at least not very\nfree, and that I may reasonably expect to find SOME degree of\nconsistency in my life and actions. ... Suppose that I have given a\ndollar to a blind beggar. Can I, if it is really an act of free-\nwill, be properly said to have given the money? Was it given because\nI was a man of tender heart, etc., etc.? ... What has all this to do\nwith acts of free-will? If they are free, they must not be\nconditioned by antecedent circumstances of any sort, by the\nmisery of the beggar, by the pity in the heart of the passer-by.\nThey must be causeless, not determined. They must drop from a clear\nsky out of the void, for just in so far as they can be accounted\nfor, they are not free.’ [Footnote: Loc. cit., vol. lviii, pp. 189,\n188.]",
        "Heaven forbid that I should get entangled here in a controversy\nabout the rights and wrongs of the free-will question at large, for\nI am only trying to illustrate vicious abstractionism by the conduct\nof some of the doctrine’s assailants. The moments of bifurcation,\nas the indeterminist seems to himself to experience them, are\nmoments both of re-direction and of continuation. But because in\nthe ’either–or’ of the re-direction we hesitate, the determinist\nabstracts this little element of discontinuity from the\nsuperabundant continuities of the experience, and cancels in\nits behalf all the connective characters with which the latter is\nfilled. Choice, for him, means henceforward DISconnection pure and\nsimple, something undetermined in advance IN ANY RESPECT WHATEVER,\nand a life of choices must be a raving chaos, at no two moments\nof which could we be treated as one and the same man. If Nero were\n’free’ at. the moment of ordering his mother’s murder, Mr. McTaggart\n[Footnote: Some Dogmas of Religion, p. 179.] assures us that no one\nwould have the right at any other moment to call him a bad man, for\nhe would then be an absolutely other Nero.",
        "A polemic author ought not merely to destroy his victim. He ought to\ntry a bit to make him feel his error–perhaps not enough to convert\nhim, but enough to give him a bad conscience and to weaken the\nenergy of his defence. These violent caricatures of men’s beliefs\narouse only contempt for the incapacity of their authors to see the\nsituations out of which the problems grow. To treat the negative\ncharacter of one abstracted element as annulling all the positive\nfeatures with which it coexists, is no way to change any\nactual indeterminist’s way of looking on the matter, tho it may make\nthe gallery applaud.",
        "Turn now to some criticisms of the ’will to believe,’ as another\nexample of the vicious way in which abstraction is currently\nemployed. The right to believe in things for the truth of which\ncomplete objective proof is yet lacking is defended by those who\napprehend certain human situations in their concreteness. In those\nsituations the mind has alternatives before it so vast that the full\nevidence for either branch is missing, and yet so significant\nthat simply to wait for proof, and to doubt while waiting, might\noften in practical respects be the same thing as weighing down the\nnegative side. Is life worth while at all? Is there any general\nmeaning in all this cosmic weather? Is anything being permanently\nbought by all this suffering? Is there perhaps a\ntransmundane experience in Being, something corresponding to a\n’fourth dimension,’ which, if we had access to it, might patch up\nsome of this world’s zerrissenheit and make things look more\nrational than they at first appear? Is there a superhuman\nconsciousness of which our minds are parts, and from which\ninspiration and help may come? Such are the questions in which the\nright to take sides practically for yes or no is affirmed by some of\nus, while others hold that this is methodologically inadmissible,\nand summon us to die professing ignorance and proclaiming the duty\nof every one to refuse to believe.",
        "I say nothing of the personal inconsistency of some of these\ncritics, whose printed works furnish exquisite illustrations of the\nwill to believe, in spite of their denunciations of it as a phrase\nand as a recommended thing. Mr. McTaggart, whom I will once more\ntake as an example, is sure that ’reality is rational and righteous’\nand ’destined sub specie temporis to become perfectly good’; and his\ncalling this belief a result of necessary logic has surely never\ndeceived any reader as to its real genesis in the gifted author’s\nmind. Mankind is made on too uniform a pattern for any of us to\nescape successfully from acts of faith. We have a lively vision of\nwhat a certain view of the universe would mean for us. We kindle\nor we shudder at the thought, and our feeling runs through our whole\nlogical nature and animates its workings. It CAN’T be that, we feel;\nit MUST be this. It must be what it OUGHT to be, and OUGHT to be\nthis; and then we seek for every reason, good or bad, to make this\nwhich so deeply ought to be, seem objectively the probable thing. We\nshow the arguments against it to be insufficient, so that it MAY be\ntrue; we represent its appeal to be to our whole nature’s loyalty\nand not to any emaciated faculty of syllogistic proof. We reinforce\nit by remembering the enlargement of our world by music, by thinking\nof the promises of sunsets and the impulses from vernal woods. And\nthe essence of the whole experience, when the individual swept\nthrough it says finally ’I believe,’ is the intense concreteness of\nhis vision, the individuality of the hypothesis before him, and\nthe complexity of the various concrete motives and perceptions that\nissue in his final state.",
        "But see now how the abstractionist treats this rich and intricate\nvision that a certain state of things must be true. He accuses\nthe believer of reasoning by the following syllogism:–",
        "All good desires must be fulfilled; The desire to believe this\nproposition is a good desire;",
        "Ergo, this proposition must be believed.",
        "He substitutes this abstraction for the concrete state of mind of\nthe believer, pins the naked absurdity of it upon him, and\neasily proves that any one who defends him must be the greatest fool\non earth. As if any real believer ever thought in this preposterous\nway, or as if any defender of the legitimacy of men’s concrete ways\nof concluding ever used the abstract and general premise, ’All\ndesires must be fulfilled’! Nevertheless, Mr. McTaggart solemnly and\nlaboriously refutes the syllogism in sections 47 to 57 of the above-\ncited book. He shows that there is no fixed link in the dictionary\nbetween the abstract concepts ’desire,’ ’goodness’ and ’reality’;\nand he ignores all the links which in the single concrete case the\nbeliever feels and perceives to be there! He adds:–",
        "’When the reality of a thing is uncertain, the argument encourages\nus to suppose that our approval of a thing can determine its\nreality. And when this unhallowed link has once been established,\nretribution overtakes us. For when the reality of the thing is\nindependently certain, we [then] have to admit that the reality of\nthe thing should determine our approval of that thing. I find it\ndifficult to imagine a more degraded position.’",
        "One here feels tempted to quote ironically Hegel’s famous equation\nof the real with the rational to his english disciple, who ends\nhis chapter with the heroic words:–",
        "’For those who do not pray, there remains the resolve that, so far\nas their strength may permit, neither the pains of death nor the\npains of life shall drive them to any comfort in that which they\nhold to be false, or drive them from any comfort [discomfort?] in\nthat which they hold to be true.’",
        "How can so ingenious-minded a writer fail to see how far over the\nheads of the enemy all his arrows pass? When Mr. McTaggart\nhimself believes that the universe is run by the dialectic energy of\nthe absolute idea, his insistent desire to have a world of that sort\nis felt by him to be no chance example of desire in general, but\nan altogether peculiar insight-giving passion to which, in this if\nin no other instance, he would be stupid not to yield. He obeys its\nconcrete singularity, not the bare abstract feature in it of being a\n’desire.’ His situation is as particular as that of an actress who\nresolves that it is best for her to marry and leave the stage, of\na priest who becomes secular, of a politician who abandons public\nlife. What sensible man would seek to refute the concrete decisions\nof such persons by tracing them to abstract premises, such as that\n’all actresses must marry,’ ’all clergymen must be laymen,’\n’all politicians should resign their posts’? Yet this type of\nrefutation, absolutely unavailing though it be for purposes of\nconversion, is spread by Mr. McTaggart through many pages of his\nbook. For the aboundingness of our real reasons he substitutes one\nnarrow point. For men’s real probabilities he gives a skeletonized\nabstraction which no man was ever tempted to believe.",
        "The abstraction in my next example is less simple, but is quite as\nflimsy as a weapon of attack. Empiricists think that truth in\ngeneral is distilled from single men’s beliefs; and the so-called\npragmatists ’go them one better’ by trying to define what it\nconsists in when it comes. It consists, I have elsewhere said,\nin such a working on the part of the beliefs as may bring the man\ninto satisfactory relations with objects to which these latter\npoint. The working is of course a concrete working in the actual\nexperience of human beings, among their ideas, feelings,\nperceptions, beliefs and acts, as well as among the physical things\nof their environment, and the relations must be understood as being\npossible as well as actual. In the chapter on truth of my book\nPragmatism I have taken pains to defend energetically this view.\nStrange indeed have been the misconceptions of it by its enemies,\nand many have these latter been. Among the most formidable-sounding\nonslaughts on the attempt to introduce some concreteness into our\nnotion of what the truth of an idea may mean, is one that has been\nraised in many quarters to the effect that to make truth grow in any\nway out of human opinion is but to reproduce that\nprotagorean doctrine that the individual man is ’the measure of all\nthings,’ which Plato in his immortal dialogue, the Thaeatetus, is\nunanimously said to have laid away so comfortably in its grave\ntwo thousand years ago. The two cleverest brandishers of this\nobjection to make truth concrete, Professors Rickert and\nMunsterberg, write in German, [Footnote: Munsterberg’s book has just\nappeared in an English version: The Eternal Values, Boston,\n1909.] and ’relativismus’ is the name they give to the heresy which\nthey endeavor to uproot.",
        "The first step in their campaign against ’relativismus’ is entirely\nin the air. They accuse relativists–and we pragmatists are typical\nrelativists–of being debarred by their self-adopted principles, not\nonly from the privilege which rationalist philosophers enjoy, of\nbelieving that these principles of their own are truth impersonal\nand absolute, but even of framing the abstract notion of such a\ntruth, in the pragmatic sense, of an ideal opinion in which all men\nmight agree, and which no man should ever wish to change. Both\ncharges fall wide of their mark. I myself, as a pragmatist, believe\nin my own account of truth as firmly as any rationalist can possibly\nbelieve in his. And I believe in it for the very reason that I have\nthe idea of truth which my learned adversaries contend that no\npragmatist can frame. I expect, namely, that the more fully\nmen discuss and test my account, the more they will agree that it\nfits, and the less will they desire a change. I may of course be\npremature in this confidence, and the glory of being truth final and\nabsolute may fall upon some later revision and correction of my\nscheme, which later will then be judged untrue in just the\nmeasure in which it departs from that finally\nsatisfactory formulation. To admit, as we pragmatists do, that we\nare liable to correction (even tho we may not expect it) involves\nthe use on our part of an ideal standard. Rationalists\nthemselves are, as individuals, sometimes sceptical enough to admit\nthe abstract possibility of their own present opinions being\ncorrigible and revisable to some degree, so the fact that the mere\nNOTION of an absolute standard should seem to them so important a\nthing to claim for themselves and to deny to us is not easy\nto explain. If, along with the notion of the standard, they could\nalso claim its exclusive warrant for their own fulminations now, it\nwould be important to them indeed. But absolutists like Rickert\nfreely admit the sterility of the notion, even in their own hands.\nTruth is what we OUGHT to believe, they say, even tho no man ever\ndid or shall believe it, and even tho we have no way of getting at\nit save by the usual empirical processes of testing our opinions by\none another and by facts. Pragmatically, then, this part of the\ndispute is idle. No relativist who ever actually walked the earth\n[Footnote: Of course the bugaboo creature called ’the sceptic’ in\nthe logic-books, who dogmatically makes the statement that\nno statement, not even the one he now makes, is true, is a\nmere mechanical toy–target for the rationalist shooting-gallery–\n hit him and he turns a summersault–yet he is the only sort of\nrelativist whom my colleagues appear able to imagine to exist.] has\ndenied the regulative character in his own thinking of the notion of\nabsolute truth. What is challenged by relativists is the pretence on\nany one’s part to have found for certain at any given moment what\nthe shape of that truth is. Since the better absolutists agree in\nthis, admitting that the proposition ’There is absolute truth’ is\nthe only absolute truth of which we can be sure, [Footnote:\nCompare Bickert’s Gegenstand der Erkentniss, pp. 187, 138.\nMunsterberg’s version of this first truth is that ’Es gibt eine\nWelt,’–see his Philosophie der Werte, pp. 38 and 74 And, after all,\nboth these philosophers confess in the end that the primal truth of\nwhich they consider our supposed denial so irrational is not\nproperly an insight at all, but a dogma adopted by the will which\nany one who turns his back on duty may disregard! But if it all\nreverts to ’the will to believe,’ pragmatists have that privilege as\nwell as their critics.] further debate is practically unimportant,\nso we may pass to their next charge.",
        "It is in this charge that the vicious abstractionism becomes most\napparent. The antipragmatist, in postulating absolute truth,\nrefuses to give any account of what the words may mean. For him they\nform a self-explanatory term. The pragmatist, on the\ncontrary, articulately defines their meaning. Truth absolute, he\nsays, means an ideal set of formulations towards which all opinions\nmay in the long run of experience be expected to converge. In this\ndefinition of absolute truth he not only postulates that there is a\ntendency to such convergence of opinions, to such ultimate\nconsensus, but he postulates the other factors of his definition\nequally, borrowing them by anticipation from the true conclusions\nexpected to be reached. He postulates the existence of opinions, he\npostulates the experience that will sift them, and the consistency\nwhich that experience will show. He justifies himself in these\nassumptions by saying that they are not postulates in the strict\nsense but simple inductions from the past extended to the future by\nanalogy; and he insists that human opinion has already reached a\npretty stable equilibrium regarding them, and that if its\nfuture development fails to alter them, the definition itself, with\nall its terms included, will be part of the very absolute truth\nwhich it defines. The hypothesis will, in short, have worked\nsuccessfully all round the circle and proved self-corroborative, and\nthe circle will be closed.",
        "The anti-pragmatist, however, immediately falls foul of the word\n’opinion’ here, abstracts it from the universe of life, and uses it\nas a bare dictionary-substantive, to deny the rest of the\nassumptions which it coexists withal. The dictionary says that an\nopinion is ’what some one thinks or believes.’ This\ndefinition leaves every one’s opinion free to be autogenous, or\nunrelated either to what any one else may think or to what the truth\nmay be.",
        "Therefore, continue our abstractionists, we must conceive it as\nessentially thus unrelated, so that even were a billion men to sport\nthe same opinion, and only one man to differ, we could admit no\ncollateral circumstances which might presumptively make it more\nprobable that he, not they, should be wrong. Truth, they say,\nfollows not the counting of noses, nor is it only another name for a\nmajority vote. It is a relation that antedates experience,\nbetween our opinions and an independent something which the\npragmatist account ignores, a relation which, tho the opinions of\nindividuals should to all eternity deny it, would still remain to\nqualify them as false. To talk of opinions without referring to this\nindependent something, the anti-pragmatist assures us, is to play\nHamlet with Hamlet’s part left out.",
        "But when the pragmatist speaks of opinions, does he mean any such\ninsulated and unmotived abstractions as are here supposed? Of course\nnot, he means men’s opinions in the flesh, as they have really\nformed themselves, opinions surrounded by their causes and\nthe influences they obey and exert, and along with the whole\nenvironment of social communication of which they are a part and out\nof which they take their rise. Moreover the ’experience’ which the\npragmatic definition postulates is the independent something which\nthe anti-pragmatist accuses him of ignoring. Already have men grown\nunanimous in the opinion that such experience is of an\nindependent reality, the existence of which all opinions\nmust acknowledge, in order to be true. Already do they agree that in\nthe long run it is useless to resist experience’s pressure; that the\nmore of it a man has, the better position he stands in, in respect\nof truth; that some men, having had more experience, are therefore\nbetter authorities than others; that some are also wiser by nature\nand better able to interpret the experience they have had; that it\nis one part of such wisdom to compare notes, discuss, and follow the\nopinion of our betters; and that the more systematically and\nthoroughly such comparison and weighing of opinions is pursued, the\ntruer the opinions that survive are likely to be. When the\npragmatist talks of opinions, it is opinions as they thus concretely\nand livingly and interactingly and correlatively exist that he has\nin mind; and when the anti-pragmatist tries to floor him because the\nword ’opinion’ can also be taken abstractly and as if it had no\nenvironment, he simply ignores the soil out of which the whole\ndiscussion grows. His weapons cut the air and strike no blow. No\none gets wounded in the war against caricatures of belief and\nskeletons of opinion of which the German onslaughts upon\n’relativismus’ consists. Refuse to use the word ’opinion’\nabstractly, keep it in its real environment, and the withers of\npragmatism remain unwrung. That men do exist who are ’opinionated,’\nin the sense that their opinions are self-willed, is unfortunately a\nfact that must be admitted, no matter what one’s notion of truth in\ngeneral may be. But that this fact should make it impossible for\ntruth to form itself authentically out of the life of opinion is\nwhat no critic has yet proved. Truth may well consist of\ncertain opinions, and does indeed consist of nothing but opinions,\ntho not every opinion need be true. No pragmatist needs to dogmatize\nabout the consensus of opinion in the future being right–he need\nonly postulate that it will probably contain more of truth than any\none’s opinion now.",
