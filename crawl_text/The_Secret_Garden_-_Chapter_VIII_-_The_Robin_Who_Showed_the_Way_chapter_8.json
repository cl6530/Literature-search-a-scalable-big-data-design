        "She looked at the key quite a long time.  She turned it\nover and over, and thought about it.  As I have said before,\nshe was not a child who had been trained to ask permission\nor consult her elders about things.  All she thought about\nthe key was that if it was the key to the closed garden,\nand she could find out where the door was, she could\nperhaps open it and see what was inside the walls,\nand what had happened to the old rose-trees. It was because\nit had been shut up so long that she wanted to see it.\nIt seemed as if it must be different from other places\nand that something strange must have happened to it\nduring ten years.  Besides that, if she liked it she\ncould go into it every day and shut the door behind her,\nand she could make up some play of her own and play it\nquite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was,\nbut would think the door was still locked and the key\nburied in the earth.  The thought of that pleased her\nvery much.",
        "Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred\nmysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever\nto do to amuse herself, had set her inactive brain\nto working and was actually awakening her imagination.\nThere is no doubt that the fresh, strong, pure air from the\nmoor had a great deal to do with it.  Just as it had given\nher an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred\nher blood, so the same things had stirred her mind.\nIn India she had always been too hot and languid and weak\nto care much about anything, but in this place she\nwas beginning to care and to want to do new things.\nAlready she felt less “contrary,” though she did not\nknow why.",
        "She put the key in her pocket and walked up and down\nher walk.  No one but herself ever seemed to come there,\nso she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather,\nat the ivy growing on it.  The ivy was the baffling thing.\nHowsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing\nbut thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves.  She was\nvery much disappointed.  Something of her contrariness\ncame back to her as she paced the walk and looked over it\nat the tree-tops inside.  It seemed so silly, she said\nto herself, to be near it and not be able to get in.\nShe took the key in her pocket when she went back to\nthe house, and she made up her mind that she would always\ncarry it with her when she went out, so that if she ever\nshould find the hidden door she would be ready.",
        "Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at\nthe cottage, but she was back at her work in the morning\nwith cheeks redder than ever and in the best of spirits.",
        "“I got up at four o’clock,” she said.  “Eh! it was pretty on th’\nmoor with th’ birds gettin’ up an’ th’ rabbits scamperin’\nabout an’ th’ sun risin’. I didn’t walk all th’ way.  A man\ngave me a ride in his cart an’ I did enjoy myself.”",
        "She was full of stories of the delights of her day out.\nHer mother had been glad to see her and they had got the\nbaking and washing all out of the way.  She had even made\neach of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar\nin it.",
        "“I had ’em all pipin’ hot when they came in from playin’\non th’ moor.  An’ th’ cottage all smelt o’ nice, clean hot bakin’\nan’ there was a good fire, an’ they just shouted for joy.\nOur Dickon he said our cottage was good enough for a king.”",
        "In the evening they had all sat round the fire,\nand Martha and her mother had sewed patches on torn\nclothes and mended stockings and Martha had told them\nabout the little girl who had come from India and who had\nbeen waited on all her life by what Martha called “blacks\"\nuntil she didn’t know how to put on her own stockings.",
        "“Eh! they did like to hear about you,” said Martha.\n“They wanted to know all about th’ blacks an’ about th’\nship you came in.  I couldn’t tell ’em enough.”",
        "Mary reflected a little.",
        "“I’ll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,\"\nshe said, “so that you will have more to talk about.\nI dare say they would like to hear about riding on elephants\nand camels, and about the officers going to hunt tigers.”",
        "“My word!” cried delighted Martha.  “It would set ’em\nclean off their heads.  Would tha’ really do that,\nMiss? It would be same as a wild beast show like we heard\nthey had in York once.”",
        "“India is quite different from Yorkshire,” Mary said slowly,\nas she thought the matter over.  “I never thought of that.\nDid Dickon and your mother like to hear you talk about me?”",
        "“Why, our Dickon’s eyes nearly started out o’ his head,\nthey got that round,” answered Martha.  “But mother, she was\nput out about your seemin’ to be all by yourself like.\nShe said, ’Hasn’t Mr. Craven got no governess for her,\nnor no nurse?’ and I said, ’No, he hasn’t, though Mrs. Medlock\nsays he will when he thinks of it, but she says he mayn’t\nthink of it for two or three years.’”",
        "“I don’t want a governess,” said Mary sharply.",
        "“But mother says you ought to be learnin’ your book by this time\nan’\nyou ought to have a woman to look after you, an’ she says:\n`Now, Martha, you just think how you’d feel yourself, in a big\nplace like that, wanderin’ about all alone, an’ no mother.\nYou do your best to cheer her up,’ she says, an’ I said I would.”",
        "Mary gave her a long, steady look.",
        "“You do cheer me up,” she said.  “I like to hear you talk.”",
        "Presently Martha went out of the room and came back\nwith something held in her hands under her apron.",
        "“What does tha’ think,” she said, with a cheerful grin.\n“I’ve brought thee a present.”",
        "“A present!” exclaimed Mistress Mary.  How could a cottage\nfull of fourteen hungry people give any one a present!",
        "“A man was drivin’ across the moor peddlin’,” Martha explained.\n“An’ he stopped his cart at our door.  He had pots an’\npans an’ odds an’ ends, but mother had no money to buy\nanythin’. Just as he was goin’ away our ’Lizabeth Ellen\ncalled out, `Mother, he’s got skippin’-ropes with red an’\nblue handles.’ An’ mother she calls out quite sudden,\n`Here, stop, mister! How much are they?’ An’ he says\n`Tuppence’, an’ mother she began fumblin’ in her pocket an’\nshe says to me, `Martha, tha’s brought me thy wages like\na good lass, an’ I’ve got four places to put every penny,\nbut I’m just goin’ to take tuppence out of it to buy\nthat child a skippin’-rope,’ an’ she bought one an’\nhere it is.”",
        "She brought it out from under her apron and exhibited\nit quite proudly.  It was a strong, slender rope\nwith a striped red and blue handle at each end,\nbut Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before.\nShe gazed at it with a mystified expression.",
        "“What is it for?” she asked curiously.",
        "“For!” cried out Martha.  “Does tha’ mean that they’ve not\ngot skippin’-ropes in India, for all they’ve got elephants\nand tigers and camels! No wonder most of ’em’s black.\nThis is what it’s for; just watch me.”",
        "And she ran into the middle of the room and, taking a\nhandle in each hand, began to skip, and skip, and skip,\nwhile Mary turned in her chair to stare at her, and the\nqueer faces in the old portraits seemed to stare at her,\ntoo, and wonder what on earth this common little cottager\nhad the impudence to be doing under their very noses.\nBut Martha did not even see them.  The interest and curiosity\nin Mistress Mary’s face delighted her, and she went on skipping\nand counted as she skipped until she had reached a hundred.",
        "“I could skip longer than that,” she said when she stopped.\n“I’ve skipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve,\nbut I wasn’t as fat then as I am now, an’ I was in practice.”",
        "Mary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself.",
        "“It looks nice,” she said.  “Your mother is a kind woman.\nDo you think I could ever skip like that?”",
        "“You just try it,” urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope.\n“You can’t skip a hundred at first, but if you practice\nyou’ll mount up.  That’s what mother said.  She says,\n`Nothin’ will do her more good than skippin’ rope.  It’s th’\nsensiblest toy a child can have.  Let her play out in th’\nfresh air skippin’ an’ it’ll stretch her legs an’ arms an’\ngive her some strength in ’em.’”",
        "It was plain that there was not a great deal of strength\nin Mistress Mary’s arms and legs when she first began\nto skip.  She was not very clever at it, but she liked\nit so much that she did not want to stop.",
        "“Put on tha’ things and run an’ skip out o’ doors,\"\nsaid Martha.  “Mother said I must tell you to keep out o’\ndoors as much as you could, even when it rains a bit,\nso as tha’ wrap up warm.”",
        "Mary put on her coat and hat and took her skipping-rope\nover her arm.  She opened the door to go out, and then\nsuddenly thought of something and turned back rather slowly.",
        "“Martha,” she said, “they were your wages.  It was your\ntwo-pence really.  Thank you.” She said it stiffly\nbecause she was not used to thanking people or noticing\nthat they did things for her.  “Thank you,” she said,\nand held out her hand because she did not know what else\nto do.",
        "Martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if she\nwas not accustomed to this sort of thing either.\nThen she laughed.",
        "“Eh! th’ art a queer, old-womanish thing,” she said.\n“If tha’d been our ’Lizabeth Ellen tha’d have given me\na kiss.”",
        "Mary looked stiffer than ever.",
        "“Do you want me to kiss you?”",
        "Martha laughed again.",
        "“Nay, not me,” she answered.  “If tha’ was different,\np’raps tha’d want to thysel’. But tha’ isn’t. Run off\noutside an’ play with thy rope.”",
        "Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out of\nthe room.  Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was\nalways rather a puzzle to her.  At first she had disliked\nher very much, but now she did not.  The skipping-rope\nwas a wonderful thing.  She counted and skipped,\nand skipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red,\nand she was more interested than she had ever been since\nshe was born.  The sun was shining and a little wind was\nblowing–not a rough wind, but one which came in delightful\nlittle gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly turned\nearth with it.  She skipped round the fountain garden,\nand up one walk and down another.  She skipped at last\ninto the kitchen-garden and saw Ben Weatherstaff digging\nand talking to his robin, which was hopping about him.\nShe skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted\nhis head and looked at her with a curious expression.\nShe had wondered if he would notice her.  She wanted him\nto see her skip.",
        "“Well!” he exclaimed.  “Upon my word.  P’raps tha’\nart a young ’un, after all, an’ p’raps tha’s got\nchild’s blood in thy veins instead of sour buttermilk.\nTha’s skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name’s\nBen Weatherstaff.  I wouldn’t have believed tha’\ncould do it.”",
        "“I never skipped before,” Mary said.  “I’m just beginning.\nI can only go up to twenty.”",
        "“Tha’ keep on,” said Ben.  “Tha’ shapes well enough at it\nfor a young ’un that’s lived with heathen.  Just see how\nhe’s watchin’ thee,” jerking his head toward the robin.\n“He followed after thee yesterday.  He’ll be at it again today.\nHe’ll be bound to find out what th’ skippin’-rope is.\nHe’s never seen one.  Eh!” shaking his head at the bird,\n“tha’ curiosity will be th’ death of thee sometime if tha’\ndoesn’t look sharp.”",
        "Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard,\nresting every few minutes.  At length she went to her\nown special walk and made up her mind to try if she\ncould skip the whole length of it.  It was a good long\nskip and she began slowly, but before she had gone\nhalf-way down the path she was so hot and breathless\nthat she was obliged to stop.  She did not mind much,\nbecause she had already counted up to thirty.\nShe stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and there,\nlo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy.\nHe had followed her and he greeted her with a chirp.\nAs Mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy\nin her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she\nsaw the robin she laughed again.",
        "“You showed me where the key was yesterday,” she said.\n“You ought to show me the door today; but I don’t believe\nyou know!”",
        "The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the\ntop of the wall and he opened his beak and sang a loud,\nlovely trill, merely to show off.  Nothing in the world\nis quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he shows\noff–and they are nearly always doing it.",
        "Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her\nAyah’s stories, and she always said that what happened\nalmost at that moment was Magic.",
        "One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down\nthe walk, and it was a stronger one than the rest.\nIt was strong enough to wave the branches of the trees,\nand it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing\nsprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall.  Mary had\nstepped close to the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind\nswung aside some loose ivy trails, and more suddenly\nstill she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand.\nThis she did because she had seen something under it–a round\nknob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it.\nIt was the knob of a door.",
        "She put her hands under the leaves and began to pull\nand push them aside.  Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly\nall was a loose and swinging curtain, though some had crept\nover wood and iron.  Mary’s heart began to thump and her\nhands to shake a little in her delight and excitement.\nThe robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting\nhis head on one side, as if he were as excited as she was.\nWhat was this under her hands which was square and made\nof iron and which her fingers found a hole in?",
        "It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten\nyears and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key\nand found it fitted the keyhole.  She put the key in and\nturned it.  It took two hands to do it, but it did turn.",
        "And then she took a long breath and looked behind\nher up the long walk to see if any one was coming.\nNo one was coming.  No one ever did come, it seemed,\nand she took another long breath, because she could not\nhelp it, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy\nand pushed back the door which opened slowly–slowly.",
        "Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her,\nand stood with her back against it, looking about her\nand breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder,\nand delight.",
        "She was standing inside the secret garden.",
