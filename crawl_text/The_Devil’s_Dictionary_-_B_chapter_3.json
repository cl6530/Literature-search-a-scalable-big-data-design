        "BAAL, n.  An old deity formerly much worshiped under various names.  \nAs Baal he was popular with the Phoenicians; as Belus or Bel he had \nthe honor to be served by the priest Berosus, who wrote the famous \naccount of the Deluge; as Babel he had a tower partly erected to his \nglory on the Plain of Shinar.  From Babel comes our English word \n“babble.”  Under whatever name worshiped, Baal is the Sun-god.  As \nBeelzebub he is the god of flies, which are begotten of the sun’s rays \non the stagnant water.  In Physicia Baal is still worshiped as Bolus, \nand as Belly he is adored and served with abundant sacrifice by the \npriests of Guttledom.",
        "BABE or BABY, n.  A misshapen creature of no particular age, sex, or \ncondition, chiefly remarkable for the violence of the sympathies and \nantipathies it excites in others, itself without sentiment or emotion.  \nThere have been famous babes; for example, little Moses, from whose \nadventure in the bulrushes the Egyptian hierophants of seven centuries \nbefore doubtless derived their idle tale of the child Osiris being \npreserved on a floating lotus leaf.",
        "          Ere babes were invented\n          The girls were contended.\n          Now man is tormented\n  Until to buy babes he has squandered\n  His money.  And so I have pondered\n          This thing, and thought may be\n          ’T were better that Baby\n  The First had been eagled or condored.",

        "BAPTISM, n.  A sacred rite of such efficacy that he who finds himself \nin heaven without having undergone it will be unhappy forever.  It is \nperformed with water in two ways — by immersion, or plunging, and by \naspersion, or sprinkling.",
        "  But whether the plan of immersion\n  Is better than simple aspersion\n      Let those immersed\n      And those aspersed\n  Decide by the Authorized Version,\n  And by matching their agues tertian.",

        "BASILISK, n.  The cockatrice.  A sort of serpent hatched form the egg \nof a cock.  The basilisk had a bad eye, and its glance was fatal.  \nMany infidels deny this creature’s existence, but Semprello Aurator \nsaw and handled one that had been blinded by lightning as a punishment \nfor having fatally gazed on a lady of rank whom Jupiter loved.  Juno \nafterward restored the reptile’s sight and hid it in a cave.  Nothing \nis so well attested by the ancients as the existence of the basilisk, \nbut the cocks have stopped laying.",

        "  Why did they put him there, father?",
        "                                       Because\n  Obeying his belly he struck at the laws.",
        "  His belly?",
        "              Oh, well, he was starving, my boy —\n  A state in which, doubtless, there’s little of joy.\n  No bite had he eaten for days, and his cry\n  Was “Bread!” ever “Bread!”",
        "                              What’s the matter with pie?",
        "  With little to wear, he had nothing to sell;\n  To beg was unlawful — improper as well.",
        "  Why didn’t he work?",
        "                       He would even have done that,\n  But men said:  “Get out!” and the State remarked:  “Scat!\"\n  I mention these incidents merely to show\n  That the vengeance he took was uncommonly low.\n  Revenge, at the best, is the act of a Siou,\n  But for trifles —",
        "                      Pray what did bad Mendicant do?",
        "  Stole two loaves of bread to replenish his lack\n  And tuck out the belly that clung to his back.",
        "  Is that all father dear?",
        "                              There’s little to tell:\n  They sent him to jail, and they’ll send him to — well,\n  The company’s better than here we can boast,\n  And there’s —",
        "                  Bread for the needy, dear father?",

        "BEHAVIOR, n.  Conduct, as determined, not by principle, but by \nbreeding.  The word seems to be somewhat loosely used in Dr. Jamrach \nHolobom’s translation of the following lines from the Dies Irae:",

Galatea was once a block \nof stone.  Peresilis, who wrote in the tenth century, avers that he \ngrew up out of the ground where a priest had spilled holy water.  It \nis known that Arimaxus was derived from a hole in the earth, made by a \nstroke of lightning.  Leucomedon was the son of a cavern in Mount \nAetna, and I have myself seen a man come out of a wine cellar.",

        "Henry Ward Beecher",
        "\nBRAHMA, n.  He who created the Hindoos, who are preserved by Vishnu \nand destroyed by Siva — a rather neater division of labor than is \nfound among the deities of some other nations.

The priests of Brahma, like those of Abracadabranese, are holy \nand learned men who are never naughty.",
