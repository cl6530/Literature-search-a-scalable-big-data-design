        "    “If a man is unhappy, this must be his own fault; for\n    God made all men to be happy.\"–EPICTETUS.",
        "Life is a great gift, and as we reach years of discretion, we most of us\nnaturally ask ourselves what should be the main object of our existence.\nEven those who do not accept “the greatest good of the greatest number” as\nan absolute rule, will yet admit that we should all endeavor to contribute\nas far as we may to the happiness of our fellow-creatures. There are many,\nhowever, who seem to doubt whether it is right that we should try to be\nhappy ourselves. Our own happiness ought not, of course, to be our main\nobject, nor indeed will it ever be secured if selfishly sought. We may\nhave many pleasures in life, but must not let them have rule over us, or\nthey will soon hand us over to sorrow; and “into what dangerous and\nmiserable servitude doth he fall who suffereth pleasures and sorrows (two\nunfaithful and cruel commanders) to possess him successively?” [1]",
        "I cannot, however, but think that the world would be better and brighter\nif our teachers would dwell on the Duty of Happiness as well as on the\nHappiness of Duty, for we ought to be as cheerful as we can, if only\nbecause to be happy ourselves, is a most effectual contribution to the\nhappiness of others.",
        "Every one must have felt that a cheerful friend is like a sunny day, which\nsheds its brightness on all around; and most of us can, as we choose, make\nof this world either a palace or a prison.",
        "There is no doubt some selfish satisfaction in yielding to melancholy, and\nfancying that we are victims of fate; in brooding over grievances,\nespecially if more or less imaginary. To be bright and cheerful often\nrequires an effort; there is a certain art in keeping ourselves happy; and\nin this respect, as in others, we require to watch over and manage\nourselves, almost as if we were somebody else.",
        "Sorrow and joy, indeed, are strangely interwoven. Too often",
        "    “We look before and after,\n      And pine for what is not:\n    Our sincerest laughter\n      With some pain is fraught;\n  Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.” [2]",
        "As a nation we are prone to melancholy. It has been said of our countrymen\nthat they take even their pleasures sadly. But this, if it be true at all,\nwill, I hope, prove a transitory characteristic. “Merry England” was the\nold saying, let us hope it may become true again. We must look to the East\nfor real melancholy. What can be sadder than the lines with which Omar\nKhayyam opens his quatrains: [3]",
        "  “We sojourn here for one short day or two,\n  And all the gain we get is grief and woe;\n  And then, leaving life’s problems all unsolved\n  And harassed by regrets, we have to go;”",
        "or the Devas’ song to Prince Siddartha, in Edwin Arnold’s beautiful\nversion:",
        "  “We are the voices of the wandering wind,\n  Which moan for rest, and rest can never find.\n  Lo! as the wind is, so is mortal life–\n  A moan, a sigh, a sob, a storm, a strife.”",
        "If indeed this be true, if mortal life be so sad and full of suffering, no\nwonder that Nirvana–the cessation of sorrow–should be welcomed even at\nthe sacrifice of consciousness.",
        "But ought we not to place before ourselves a very different ideal–a\nhealthier, manlier, and nobler hope?",
        "Life is not to live merely, but to live well. There are some “who live\nwithout any design at all, and only pass in the world like straws on a\nriver: they do not go; they are carried,” [4]–but as Homer makes Ulysses\nsay, “How dull it is to pause, to make an end, to rest unburnished; not to\nshine in use–as though to breathe were life!”",
        "Goethe tells us that at thirty he resolved “to work out life no longer by\nhalves, but in all its beauty and totality.”",
        "Life indeed must be measured by thought and action, not by time. It\ncertainly may be, and ought to be, bright, interesting, and happy; and,\naccording to the Italian proverb, “if all cannot live on the Piazza, every\none may feel the sun.”",
        "If we do our best; if we do not magnify trifling troubles; if we look\nresolutely, I do not say at the bright side of things, but at things as\nthey really are; if we avail ourselves of the manifold blessings which\nsurround us; we cannot but feel that life is indeed a glorious\ninheritance.",
        "    “More servants wait on man\n  Than he’ll take notice of. In every path\n    He treads down that which doth befriend him\n    When sickness makes him pale and wan\n  Oh mighty Love! Man is one world, and hath\n    Another to attend him.” [5]",
        "Few of us, however, realize the wonderful privilege of living, or the\nblessings we inherit; the glories and beauties of the Universe, which is\nour own if we choose to have it so; the extent to which we can make\nourselves what we wish to be; or the power we possess of securing peace,\nof triumphing over pain and sorrow.",
        "Dante pointed to the neglect of opportunities as a serious fault:",
        "                       “Man can do violence\n  To himself and his own blessings, and for this\n  He, in the second round, must aye deplore,\n  With unavailing penitence, his crime.\n  Whoe’er deprives himself of life and light\n  In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,\n  And sorrows then when he should dwell in joy.”",
        "Ruskin has expressed this with special allusion to the marvellous beauty\nof this glorious world, too often taken as a matter of course, and\nremembered, if at all, almost without gratitude. “Holy men,” he complains,\n“in the recommending of the love of God to us, refer but seldom to those\nthings in which it is most abundantly and immediately shown; though they\ninsist much on His giving of bread, and raiment, and health (which He\ngives to all inferior creatures): they require us not to thank Him for\nthat glory of His works which He has permitted us alone to perceive: they\ntell us often to meditate in the closet, but they send us not, like Isaac,\ninto the fields at even: they dwell on the duty of self denial, but they\nexhibit not the duty of delight:” and yet, as he justly says elsewhere,\n“each of us, as we travel the way of life, has the choice, according to\nour working, of turning all the voices of Nature into one song of\nrejoicing; or of withering and quenching her sympathy into a fearful\nwithdrawn silence of condemnation,–into a crying out of her stones and a\nshaking of her dust against us.”",
        "Must we not all admit, with Sir Henry Taylor, that “the retrospect of life\nswarms with lost opportunities”? “Whoever enjoys not life,” says Sir T.\nBrowne, “I count him but an apparition, though he wears about him the\nvisible affections of flesh.”",
        "St. Bernard, indeed, goes so far as to maintain that “nothing can work me\ndamage except myself; the harm that I sustain I carry about with me, and\nnever am a real sufferer but by my own fault.”",
        "Some Heathen moralists also have taught very much the same lesson. “The\ngods,” says Marcus Aurelius, “have put all the means in man’s power to\nenable him not to fall into real evils. Now that which does not make a man\nworse, how can it make his life worse?”",
        "Epictetus takes the same line: “If a man is unhappy, remember that his\nunhappiness is his own fault; for God has made all men to be happy.” “I\nam,” he elsewhere says, “always content with that which happens; for I\nthink that what God chooses is better than what I choose.” And again:\n“Seek not that things should happen as you wish; but wish the things which\nhappen to be as they are, and you will have a tranquil flow of life.... If\nyou wish for anything which belongs to another, you lose that which is\nyour own.”",
        "Few, however, if any, can I think go as far as St. Bernard. We cannot but\nsuffer from pain, sickness, and anxiety; from the loss, the unkindness,\nthe faults, even the coldness of those we love. How many a day has been\ndamped and darkened by an angry word!",
        "Hegel is said to have calmly finished his Phaenomenologie des Geistes at\nJena, on the 14th October 1806, not knowing anything whatever of the\nbattle that was raging round him.",
        "Matthew Arnold has suggested that we might take a lesson from the heavenly\nbodies.",
        " “Unaffrighted by the silence round them,\n    Undistracted by the sights they see,\n  These demand not the things without them\n    Yield them love, amusement, sympathy.\n\n “Bounded by themselves, and unobservant\n    In what state God’s other works may be,\n  In their own tasks all their powers pouring,\n    These attain the mighty life you see.”",
        "It is true that",
        "  “A man is his own star;\n  Our acts our angels are\n  For good or ill,”",
        "and that “rather than follow a multitude to do evil,” one should “stand\nlike Pompey’s pillar, conspicuous by oneself, and single in\nintegrity.” [6] But to many this isolation would be itself most painful,\nfor the heart is “no island cut off from other lands, but a continent that\njoins to them.” [7]",
        "If we separate ourselves so much from the interests of those around us\nthat we do not sympathize with them in their sufferings, we shut ourselves\nout from sharing their happiness, and lose far more than we gain. If we\navoid sympathy and wrap ourselves round in a cold chain armor of\nselfishness, we exclude ourselves from many of the greatest and purest\njoys of life. To render ourselves insensible to pain we must forfeit also\nthe possibility of happiness.",
        "Moreover, much of what we call evil is really good in disguise, and we\nshould not “quarrel rashly with adversities not yet understood, nor\noverlook the mercies often bound up in them.” [8] Pleasure and pain are,\nas Plutarch says, the nails which fasten body and soul together. Pain is a\nwarning of danger, a very necessity of existence. But for it, but for the\nwarnings which our feelings give us, the very blessings by which we are\nsurrounded would soon and inevitably prove fatal. Many of those who have\nnot studied the question are under the impression that the more\ndeeply-seated portions of the body must be most sensitive. The very\nreverse is the case. The skin is a continuous and ever-watchful sentinel,\nalways on guard to give us notice of any approaching danger; while the\nflesh and inner organs, where pain would be without purpose, are, so long\nas they are in health, comparatively without sensation.",
        "“We talk,” says Helps, “of the origin of evil;... but what is evil? We\nmostly speak of sufferings and trials as good, perhaps, in their result;\nbut we hardly admit that they may be good in themselves. Yet they are\nknowledge–how else to be acquired, unless by making men as gods, enabling\nthem to understand without experience. All that men go through may be\nabsolutely the best for them–no such thing as evil, at least in our\ncustomary meaning of the word.”",
        "Indeed, “the vale best discovereth the hill,” [9] and “pour sentir les\ngrands biens, il faut qu’il connoisse les petits maux.” [10]",
        "But even if we do not seem to get all that we should wish, many will feel,\nas in Leigh Hunt’s beautiful translation of Filicaja’s sonnet, that–",
        "  “So Providence for us, high, infinite,\n  Makes our necessities its watchful task.\n  Hearkens to all our prayers, helps all our wants,\n  And e’en if it denies what seems our right,\n  Either denies because ’twould have us ask,\n  Or seems but to deny, and in denying grants.”",
        "Those on the other hand who do not accept the idea of continual\ninterferences, will rejoice in the belief that on the whole the laws of\nthe Universe work out for the general happiness.",
        "And if it does come–",
        "                     “Grief should be\n  Like joy, majestic, equable, sedate,\n  Confirming, cleansing, raising, making free:\n  Strong to consume small troubles; to commend\n  Great thoughts, grave thoughts, thoughts lasting to the end.” [11]",
        "If, however, we cannot hope that life will be all happiness, we may at\nleast secure a heavy balance on the right side; and even events which look\nlike misfortune, if boldly faced, may often be turned to good. Oftentimes,\nsays Seneca, “calamity turns to our advantage; and great ruins make way\nfor greater glories.” Helmholtz dates his start in science to an attack of\nillness. This led to his acquisition of a microscope, which he was enabled\nto purchase, owing to his having spent his autumn vacation of 1841 in the\nhospital, prostrated by typhoid fever; being a pupil, he was nursed\nwithout expense, and on his recovery he found himself in possession of the\nsavings of his small resources.",
        "“Savonarola,” says Castelar, “would, under different circumstances,\nundoubtedly have been a good husband, a tender father; a man unknown to\nhistory, utterly powerless to print upon the sands of time and upon the\nhuman soul the deep trace which he has left; but misfortune came to visit\nhim, to crush his heart, and to impart that marked melancholy which\ncharacterizes a soul in grief; and the grief that circled his brows with a\ncrown of thorns was also that which wreathed them with the splendor of\nimmortality. His hopes were centered in the woman he loved, his life was\nset upon the possession of her, and when her family finally rejected him,\npartly on account of his profession, and partly on account of his person,\nbelieved that it was death that had come upon him, when in truth it was\nimmortality.”",
        "It is however, impossible to deny the existence of evil, and the reason\nfor it has long exercised the human intellect. The Savage solves it by the\nsupposition of evil Spirits. The Greeks attributed the misfortunes of men\nin great measure to the antipathies and jealousies of gods and goddesses.\nOthers have imagined two divine principles, opposite and antagonistic–the\none friendly, the other hostile, to men.",
        "Freedom of action, however, seems to involve the existence of evil. If any\npower of selection be left us, much must depend on the choice we make. In\nthe very nature of things, two and two cannot make five. Epictetus\nimagines Jupiter addressing man as follows: “If it had been possible to\nmake your body and your property free from liability to injury, I would\nhave done so. As this could not be, I have given you a small portion of\nmyself.”",
        "This divine gift it is for us to use wisely. It is, in fact, our most\nvaluable treasure. “The soul is a much better thing than all the others\nwhich you possess. Can you then show me in what way you have taken care of\nit? For it is not likely that you, who are so wise a man, inconsiderately\nand carelessly allow the most valuable thing that you possess to be\nneglected and to perish.” [12]",
        "Moreover, even if evil cannot be altogether avoided, it is no doubt true\nthat not only whether the life we lead be good and useful, or evil and\nuseless, but also whether it be happy or unhappy, is very much in our own\npower, and depends greatly on ourselves. “Time alone relieves the foolish\nfrom sorrow, but reason the wise.” [13] and no one was ever yet made\nutterly miserable excepting by himself. We are, if not the masters, at any\nrate almost the creators of ourselves.",
        "With most of us it is not so much great sorrows, disease, or death, but\nrather the little “daily dyings” which cloud over the sunshine of life.\nMany of our troubles are insignificant in themselves, and might easily be\navoided!",
        "How happy home might generally be made but for foolish quarrels, or\nmisunderstandings, as they are well named! It is our own fault if we are\nquerulous or ill-humored; nor need we, though this is less easy, allow\nourselves to be made unhappy by the querulousness or ill-humors of others.",
        "Much of what we suffer we have brought on ourselves, if not by actual\nfault, at least by ignorance or thoughtlessness. Too often we think only\nof the happiness of the moment, and sacrifice that of the life. Troubles\ncomparatively seldom come to us, it is we who go to them. Many of us\nfritter our life away. La Bruyere says that “most men spend much of their\nlives in making the rest miserable;” or, as Goethe puts it:",
        "  “Careworn man has, in all ages,\n  Sown vanity to reap despair.”",
        "Not only do we suffer much in the anticipation of evil, as “Noah lived\nmany years under the affliction of a flood, and Jerusalem was taken unto\nJeremy before it was besieged,” but we often distress ourselves greatly in\nthe apprehension of misfortunes which after all never happen at all. We\nshould do our best and wait calmly the result. We often hear of people\nbreaking down from overwork, but in nine cases out of ten they are really\nsuffering from worry or anxiety.",
        "“Nos maux moraux,” says Rousseau, “sont tous dans l’opinion, hors un seul,\nqui est le crime; et celui-la depend de nous: nos maux physiques nous\ndetruisent, ou se detruisent. Le temps, ou la mort, sont nos remedes.”",
        "  “Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\n  Which we ascribe to heaven.” [14]",
        "This, however, applies to the grown up. With children of course it is\ndifferent. It is customary, but I think it is a mistake, to speak of happy\nchildhood. Children, however, are often over-anxious and acutely\nsensitive. Man ought to be man and master of his fate; but children are at\nthe mercy of those around them. Mr. Rarey, the great horse-tamer, has told\nus that he has known an angry word raise the pulse of a horse ten beats in\na minute. Think then how it must affect a child!",
        "It is small blame to the young if they are over-anxious; but it is a\ndanger to be striven against. “The terrors of the storm are chiefly felt\nin the parlor or the cabin.” [15]",
        "To save ourselves from imaginary, or at any rate problematical, evils, we\noften incur real suffering. “The man,” said Epicurus, “who is not content\nwith little is content with nothing.” How often do we “labor for that\nwhich satisfieth not.” More than we use is more than we need, and only a\nburden to the bearer. [16] We most of us give ourselves an immense amount\nof useless trouble; encumber ourselves, as it were, on the journey of life\nwith a dead weight of unnecessary baggage; and as “a man maketh his train\nlonger, he makes his wings shorter.” [17] In that delightful fairy tale,\nAlice through the Looking-Glass, the “White Knight” is described as\nhaving loaded himself on starting for a journey with a variety of odds and\nends, including a mousetrap, in case he was troubled by mice at night, and\na beehive in case he came across a swarm of bees.",
        "Hearne, in his Journey to the Mouth of the Coppermine River tells us\nthat a few days after starting on his expedition he met a party of\nIndians, who annexed a great deal of his property, and all Hearne says is,\n“The weight of our baggage being so much lightened, our next day’s journey\nwas much pleasanter.” I ought, however, to add that the Indians broke up\nthe philosophical instruments, which, no doubt, were rather an\nencumbrance.",
        "When troubles do come, Marcus Aurelius wisely tells us to “remember on\nevery occasion which leads thee to vexation to apply this principle, that\nthis is not a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is good fortune.” Our\nown anger indeed does us more harm than the thing which makes us angry;\nand we suffer much more from the anger and vexation which we allow acts to\nrouse in us, than we do from the acts themselves at which we are angry and\nvexed. How much most people, for instance, allow themselves to be\ndistracted and disturbed by quarrels and family disputes. Yet in nine\ncases out of ten one ought not to suffer from being found fault with. If\nthe condemnation is just, it should be welcome as a warning; if it is\nundeserved, why should we allow it to distress us?",
        "Moreover, if misfortunes happen we do but make them worse by grieving over\nthem.",
        "“I must die,” again says Epictetus. “But must I then die sorrowing? I must\nbe put in chains. Must I then also lament? I must go into exile. Can I be\nprevented from going with cheerfulness and contentment? But I will put you\nin prison. Man, what are you saying? You may put my body in prison, but my\nmind not even Zeus himself can overpower.”",
        "If, indeed, we cannot be happy, the fault is generally in ourselves.\nSocrates lived under the Thirty Tyrants. Epictetus was a poor slave, and\nyet how much we owe him!",
        "“How is it possible,” he says, “that a man who has nothing, who is naked,\nhouseless, without a hearth, squalid, without a slave, without a city, can\npass a life that flows easily? See, God has sent a man to show you that it\nis possible. Look at me, who am without a city, without a house, without\npossessions, without a slave; I sleep on the ground; I have no wife, no\nchildren, no praetorium, but only the earth and heavens, and one poor\nclock. And what do I want? Am I not without sorrow? Am I not without fear?\nAm I not free? When did any of you see me failing in the object of my\ndesire? or ever falling into that which I would avoid? Did I ever blame\nGod or man? Did I ever accuse any man? Did any of you ever see me with a\nsorrowful countenance? And how do I meet with those whom you are afraid of\nand admire? Do not I treat them like slaves? Who, when he sees me, does\nnot think that he sees his king and master?”",
        "Think how much we have to be thankful for. Few of us appreciate the number\nof our everyday blessings; we look on them as trifles, and yet “trifles\nmake perfection, and perfection is no trifle,” as Michael Angelo said. We\nforget them because they are always with us; and yet for each of us, as\nMr. Pater well observes, “these simple gifts, and others equally trivial,\nbread and wine, fruit and milk, might regain that poetic and, as it were,\nmoral significance which surely belongs to all the means of our daily\nlife, could we but break through the veil of our familiarity with things\nby no means vulgar in themselves.”",
        "“Let not,” says Isaak Walton, “the blessings we receive daily from God\nmake us not to value or not praise Him because they be common; let us not\nforget to praise Him for the innocent mirth and pleasure we have met with\nsince we met together. What would a blind man give to see the pleasant\nrivers and meadows and flowers and fountains; and this and many other like\nblessings we enjoy daily.”",
        "Contentment, we have been told by Epicurus, consists not in great wealth,\nbut in few wants. In this fortunate country, however, we may have many\nwants, and yet, if they are only reasonable, we may gratify them all.",
        "Nature indeed provides without stint the main requisites of human\nhappiness. “To watch the corn grow, or the blossoms set; to draw hard\nbreath over plough-share or spade; to read, to think, to love, to pray,\"\nthese, says Ruskin, “are the things that make men happy.”",
        "“I have fallen into the hands of thieves,” says Jeremy Taylor; “what then?\nThey have left me the sun and moon, fire and water, a loving wife and many\nfriends to pity me, and some to relieve me, and I can still discourse;\nand, unless I list, they have not taken away my merry countenance and my\ncheerful spirit and a good conscience.... And he that hath so many causes\nof joy, and so great, is very much in love with sorrow and peevishness who\nloses all these pleasures, and chooses to sit down on his little handful\nof thorns.”",
        "“When a man has such things to think on, and sees the sun, the moon, and\nstars, and enjoys earth and sea, he is not solitary or even helpless.\"\n[18]",
        "“Paradise indeed might,” as Luther said, “apply to the whole world.” What\nmore is there we could ask for ourselves? “Every sort of beauty,” says Mr.\nGreg, [19] “has been lavished on our allotted home; beauties to enrapture\nevery sense, beauties to satisfy every taste; forms the noblest and the\nloveliest, colors the most gorgeous and the most delicate, odors the\nsweetest and subtlest, harmonies the most soothing and the most stirring:\nthe sunny glories of the day; the pale Elysian grace of moonlight; the\nlake, the mountain, the primeval forest, and the boundless ocean; ’silent\npinnacles of aged snow’ in one hemisphere, the marvels of tropical\nluxuriance in another; the serenity of sunsets; the sublimity of storms;\neverything is bestowed in boundless profusion on the scene of our\nexistence; we can conceive or desire nothing more exquisite or perfect\nthan what is round us every hour; and our perceptions are so framed as to\nbe consciously alive to all. The provision made for our sensuous enjoyment\nis in overflowing abundance; so is that for the other elements of our\ncomplex nature. Who that has revelled in the opening ecstasies of a young\nImagination, or the rich marvels of the world of Thought, does not confess\nthat the Intelligence has been dowered at least with as profuse a\nbeneficence as the Senses? Who that has truly tasted and fathomed human\nLove in its dawning and crowning joys has not thanked God for a felicity\nwhich indeed ’passeth understanding.’ If we had set our fancy to picture a\nCreator occupied solely in devising delight for children whom he loved, we\ncould not conceive one single element of bliss which is not here.”",
