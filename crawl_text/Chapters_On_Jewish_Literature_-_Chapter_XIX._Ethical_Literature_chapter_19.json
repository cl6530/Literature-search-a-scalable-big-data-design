        "A large proportion of all Hebrew books is ethical. Many of the works\nalready treated here fall under this category. The Talmudical,\nexegetical, and philosophical writings of Jews were also ethical\ntreatises. In this chapter, however, attention will be restricted to a\nfew books which are in a special sense ethical.",
        "Collections of moral proverbs, such as the “Choice of Pearls,\"\nattributed to Ibn Gebirol, and the “Maxims of the Philosophers” by\nCharizi, were great favorites in the Middle Ages. They had a distinct\ncharm, but they were not original. They were either compilations from\nolder books or direct translations from the Arabic. It was far otherwise\nwith the ethical work entitled “Heart Duties” (Choboth ha-Lebaboth),\nby Bachya Ibn Pekuda (about 1050-1100). This was as original as it was\nforcible. Bachya founded his ethical system on the Talmud and on the\nphilosophical notions current in his day, but he evolved out of these\nelements an original view of life. The inner duties dictated by\nconscience were set above all conventional morality. Bachya probed the\nvery heart of religion. His soul was filled with God, and this\ncommunion, despite the ascetic feelings to which it gave rise, was to\nBachya an exceeding joy. His book thrills the reader with the author’s\nown chastened enthusiasm. The “Heart Duties” of Bachya is the most\ninspired book written by a Jew in the Middle Ages.",
        "In part worthy of a place by the side of Bachya’s treatise is an ethical\nbook written in the Rhinelands during the thirteenth century. “The Book\nof the Pious” (Sefer ha-Chassidim) is mystical, and in course of time\nsuperstitious elements were interpolated. Wrongly attributed to a single\nwriter, Judah Chassid, the “Book of the Pious” was really the combined\nproduct of the Jewish spirit in the thirteenth century. It is a\nconglomerate of the sublime and the trivial, the purely ethical with the\nceremonial. With this popular and remarkable book may be associated\nother conglomerates of the ritual, the ethical, and the mystical, as the\nRokeach by Eleazar of Worms.",
        "A simpler but equally popular work was Yedaiah Bedaressi’s “Examination\nof the World” (Bechinath Olam), written in about the year 1310. Its\nstyle is florid but poetical, and the many quaint turns which it gives\nto quotations from the Bible remind the reader of Ibn Gebirol. Its\nearnest appeal to man to aim at the higher life, its easily\nintelligible and commonplace morals, endeared it to the “general reader\"\nof the Middle Ages. Few books have been more often printed, few more\noften translated.",
        "Another favorite class of ethical books consisted of compilations made\ndirect from the Talmud and the Midrash. The oldest and most prized of\nthese was Isaac Aboab’s “Lamp of Light” (Menorath ha-Maor). It was an\nadmirably written book, clearly arranged, and full to the brim of\nethical gems. Aboab’s work was written between 1310 and 1320. It is\narranged according to subjects, differing in this respect from another\nvery popular compilation, Jacob Ibn Chabib’s “Eye of Jacob” (En\nYaakob), which was completed in the sixteenth century. In this, the\nHagadic passages of the Talmud are extracted without arrangement, the\norder of the Talmud itself being retained. The “Eye of Jacob” was an\nextremely popular work.",
        "Of the purely devotional literature of Judaism, it is impossible to\nspeak here. One other ethical book must be here noticed, for it has\nattained wide and deserved popularity. This is the “Path of the Upright\"\n(Messilath Yesharim) by Moses Chayim Luzzatto, of whom more will be\nsaid in a later chapter. But a little more space must be here devoted to\na species of ethical tract which was peculiar to Jewish moralists. These\ntracts were what are known as Ethical Wills.",
        "These Ethical Wills (Zevaoth) contained the express directions of\nfathers to their children or of aged teachers to their disciples. They\nwere for the most part written calmly in old age, but not immediately\nbefore the writers’ death. Some of them were very carefully composed,\nand amount to formal ethical treatises. But in the main they are\ncharmingly natural and unaffected. They were intended for the absolutely\nprivate use of children and relatives, or of some beloved pupil who\nheld the dearest place in his master’s regard. They were not designed\nfor publication, and thus, as the writer had no reason to expect that\nhis words would pass beyond a limited circle, the Ethical Will is a\nclear revelation of his innermost feelings and ideals. Intellectually\nsome of these Ethical Wills are poor; morally, however, the general\nlevel is very high.",
        "Addresses of parents to their children occur in the Bible, the\nApocrypha, and the Rabbinical literature. But the earliest extant\nEthical Will written as an independent document is that of Eleazar, the\nson of Isaac of Worms (about 1050), who must not be confused with the\nauthor of the Rokeach. The eleventh and twelfth centuries supply few\nexamples of the Ethical Will, but from the thirteenth century onwards\nthere is a plentiful array of them. “Think not of evil,” says Eleazar of\nWorms, “for evil thinking leads to evil doing.... Purify thy body, the\ndwelling-place of thy soul.... Give of all thy food a portion to God.\nLet God’s portion be the best, and give it to the poor.” The will of the\ntranslator Judah Ibn Tibbon (about 1190) contains at least one passage\nworthy of Ruskin: “Avoid bad society, make thy books thy companions, let\nthy book-cases and shelves be thy gardens and pleasure-grounds. Pluck\nthe fruit that grows therein, gather the roses, the spices, and the\nmyrrh. If thy soul be satiate and weary, change from garden to garden,\nfrom furrow to furrow, from sight to sight. Then will thy desire renew\nitself, and thy soul be satisfied with delight.” The will of Nachmanides\nis an unaffected eulogy of humility. Asher, the son of Yechiel\n(fourteenth century), called his will “Ways of Life,” and it includes\n132 maxims, which are often printed in the prayer-book. “Do not obey the\nLaw for reward, nor avoid sin from fear of punishment, but serve God\nfrom love. Sleep not over-much, but rise with the birds. Be not\nover-hasty to reply to offensive remarks; raise not thy hand against\nanother, even if he curse thy father or mother in thy presence.”",
        "Some of these wills, like that of the son of the last mentioned, are\nwritten in rhymed prose; some are controversial. Joseph Ibn Caspi writes\nin 1322: “How can I know God, and that he is one, unless I know what\nknowing means, and what constitutes unity? Why should these things be\nleft to non-Jewish philosophers? Why should Aristotle retain sole\npossession of the treasures that he stole from Solomon?” The belief that\nAristotle had visited Jerusalem with Alexander the Great, and there\nobtained possession of Solomon’s wisdom, was one of the most curious\nmyths of the Middle Ages. The will of Eleazar the Levite of Mainz (1357)\nis a simple document, without literary merit, but containing a clear\nexposition of duty. “Judge every man charitably, and use your best\nefforts to find a kindly explanation of conduct, however suspicious....\nGive in charity an exact tithe of your property. Never turn a poor man\naway empty-handed. Talk no more than is necessary, and thus avoid\nslander. Be not as dumb cattle that utter no word of gratitude, but\nthank God for his bounties at the time at which they occur, and in your\nprayers let the memory of these personal favors warm your hearts, and\nprompt you to special fervor during the utterance of the communal thanks\nfor communal well-being. When words of thanks occur in the liturgy,\npause and silently reflect on the goodness of God to you that day.”",
        "In striking contrast to the simplicity of the foregoing is the elaborate\n“Letter of Advice” by Solomon Alami (beginning of the fifteenth\ncentury). It is composed in beautiful rhymed prose, and is an important\nhistorical record. For the author shared the sufferings of the Jews of\nthe Iberian peninsula in 1391, and this gives pathetic point to his\ncounsel: “Flee without hesitation when exile is the only means of\nsecuring religious freedom; have no regard to your worldly career or\nyour property, but go at once.”",
        "It is needless to indicate fully the nature of the Ethical Wills of the\nsixteenth and subsequent centuries. They are closely similar to the\nforegoing, but they tend to become more learned and less simple. Yet,\nthough as literature they are often quite insignificant, as ethics they\nrarely sink below mediocrity.",
