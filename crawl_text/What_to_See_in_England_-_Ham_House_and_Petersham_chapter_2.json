        "The little church at Petersham is interesting on account of the memorial\nit contains to the memory of Vancouver, the discoverer, in 1792, of the\nisland bearing his name, on the west coast of the North American\ncontinent. It is said that “the unceasing exertions which Vancouver\nhimself made to complete the gigantic task of surveying 9000 miles of\nunknown and intricate coasts–a labour chiefly performed in open\nboats–made an inroad on his constitution from which he never recovered,\nand, declining gradually, he died in May 1798.” The church is also the\nburying-place of the Duchess of Lauderdale, whose residence was Ham\nHouse. This fine old Jacobean mansion stands at no great distance from\nPetersham Church. It was built as a residence for Prince Henry, the\neldest son of James I., who, however, died early, the gossips of the\ntime hinting at poison. The house is still said to be haunted by the\nspirit of the old Duchess of Lauderdale, who lived in the time of\nCharles II.",
