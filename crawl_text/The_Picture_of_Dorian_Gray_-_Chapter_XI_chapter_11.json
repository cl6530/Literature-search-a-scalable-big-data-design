        "He passed out of the room, and began the ascent, Basil\nHallward following close behind.  They walked softly, as men\ninstinctively do at night.  The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the\nwall and staircase.  A rising wind made some of the windows rattle.",
        "When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the\nfloor, and taking out the key turned it in the lock.  “You insist on\nknowing, Basil?” he asked, in a low voice.",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“I am delighted,” he murmured, smiling.  Then he added, somewhat\nbitterly, “You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know\neverything about me.  You have had more to do with my life than you\nthink.”  And, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in.  A\ncold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment\nin a flame of murky orange.  He shuddered.  “Shut the door behind\nyou,” he said, as he placed the lamp on the table.",
        "[82] Hallward glanced round him, with a puzzled expression.  The room\nlooked as if it had not been lived in for years.  A faded Flemish\ntapestry, a curtained picture, an old Italian cassone, and an almost\nempty bookcase,–that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a\nchair and a table.  As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle\nthat was standing on the mantel-shelf, he saw that the whole place\nwas covered with dust, and that the carpet was in holes.  A mouse ran\nscuffling behind the wainscoting.  There was a damp odor of mildew.",
        "“So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil?  Draw\nthat curtain back, and you will see mine.”",
        "The voice that spoke was cold and cruel.  “You are mad, Dorian, or\nplaying a part,” muttered Hallward, frowning.",
        "“You won’t?  Then I must do it myself,” said the young man; and he\ntore the curtain from its rod, and flung it on the ground.",
        "An exclamation of horror broke from Hallward’s lips as he saw in the\ndim light the hideous thing on the canvas leering at him.  There was\nsomething in its expression that filled him with disgust and\nloathing.  Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray’s own face that he was\nlooking at!  The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely marred\nthat marvellous beauty.  There was still some gold in the thinning\nhair and some scarlet on the sensual lips.  The sodden eyes had kept\nsomething of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not\nyet passed entirely away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic\nthroat.  Yes, it was Dorian himself.  But who had done it?  He seemed\nto recognize his own brush-work, and the frame was his own design.\nThe idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid.  He seized the lighted\ncandle, and held it to the picture.  In the left-hand corner was his\nown name, traced in long letters of bright vermilion.",
        "It was some foul parody, some infamous, ignoble satire.  He had never\ndone that.  Still, it was his own picture.  He knew it, and he felt\nas if his blood had changed from fire to sluggish ice in a moment.\nHis own picture!  What did it mean?  Why had it altered?  He turned,\nand looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man.  His mouth\ntwitched, and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate.  He\npassed his hand across his forehead.  It was dank with clammy sweat.",
        "The young man was leaning against the mantel-shelf, watching him with\nthat strange expression that is on the faces of those who are\nabsorbed in a play when a great artist is acting.  There was neither\nreal sorrow in it nor real joy.  There was simply the passion of the\nspectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in the eyes.  He had\ntaken the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending\nto do so.",
        "“What does this mean?” cried Hallward, at last.  His own voice\nsounded shrill and curious in his ears.",
        "“Years ago, when I was a boy,” said Dorian Gray, “you met me, devoted\nyourself to me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my good\nlooks.  One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who explained\nto me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me that\nrevealed to me the wonder of beauty.  In a mad moment, that [83] I\ndon’t know, even now, whether I regret or not, I made a wish.\nPerhaps you would call it a prayer . . . .”",
        "“I remember it!  Oh, how well I remember it!  No! the thing is\nimpossible.  The room is damp.  The mildew has got into the canvas.\nThe paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them.  I tell\nyou the thing is impossible.”",
        "“Ah, what is impossible?” murmured the young man, going over to the\nwindow, and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained\nglass.",
        "“You told me you had destroyed it.”",
        "“I was wrong.  It has destroyed me.”",
        "“I don’t believe it is my picture.”",
        "“Can’t you see your romance in it?” said Dorian, bitterly.",
        "“My romance, as you call it . . .”",
        "“As you called it.”",
        "“There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful.  This is the face of\na satyr.”",
        "“It is the face of my soul.”",
        "“God! what a thing I must have worshipped!  This has the eyes of a\ndevil.”",
        "“Each of us has Heaven and Hell in him, Basil,” cried Dorian, with a\nwild gesture of despair.",
        "Hallward turned again to the portrait, and gazed at it.  “My God! if\nit is true,” he exclaimed, “and this is what you have done with your\nlife, why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you\nfancy you to be!”  He held the light up again to the canvas, and\nexamined it.  The surface seemed to be quite undisturbed, and as he\nhad left it.  It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and\nhorror had come.  Through some strange quickening of inner life the\nleprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away.  The rotting of a\ncorpse in a watery grave was not so fearful.",
        "His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor, and\nlay there sputtering.  He placed his foot on it and put it out.  Then\nhe flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the\ntable and buried his face in his hands.",
        "“Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! what an awful lesson!”  There was\nno answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window.",
        "“Pray, Dorian, pray,” he murmured.  “What is it that one was taught\nto say in one’s boyhood?  ’Lead us not into temptation.  Forgive us\nour sins.  Wash away our iniquities.’  Let us say that together.  The\nprayer of your pride has been answered.  The prayer of your\nrepentance will be answered also.  I worshipped you too much.  I am\npunished for it.  You worshipped yourself too much.  We are both\npunished.”",
        "Dorian Gray turned slowly around, and looked at him with tear-dimmed\neyes.  “It is too late, Basil,” he murmured.",
        "“It is never too late, Dorian.  Let us kneel down and try if we can\nremember a prayer.  Isn’t there a verse somewhere, ’Though your sins\nbe as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow’?”",
        "[84] “Those words mean nothing to me now.”",
        "“Hush! don’t say that.  You have done enough evil in your life.  My\nGod! don’t you see that accursed thing leering at us?”",
        "Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable\nfeeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him.  The mad passions\nof a hunted animal stirred within him, and he loathed the man who was\nseated at the table, more than he had ever loathed anything in his\nwhole life.  He glanced wildly around.  Something glimmered on the\ntop of the painted chest that faced him.  His eye fell on it.  He\nknew what it was.  It was a knife that he had brought up, some days\nbefore, to cut a piece of cord, and had forgotten to take away with\nhim.  He moved slowly towards it, passing Hallward as he did so.  As\nsoon as he got behind him, he seized it, and turned round.  Hallward\nmoved in his chair as if he was going to rise.  He rushed at him, and\ndug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear, crushing\nthe man’s head down on the table, and stabbing again and again.",
        "There was a stifled groan, and the horrible sound of some one choking\nwith blood.  The outstretched arms shot up convulsively three times,\nwaving grotesque stiff-fingered hands in the air.  He stabbed him\nonce more, but the man did not move.  Something began to trickle on\nthe floor.  He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down.\nThen he threw the knife on the table, and listened.",
        "He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet.\nHe opened the door, and went out on the landing.  The house was quite\nquiet.  No one was stirring.",
        "He took out the key, and returned to the room, locking himself in as\nhe did so.",
        "The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table\nwith bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms.  Had it\nnot been for the red jagged tear in the neck, and the clotted black\npool that slowly widened on the table, one would have said that the\nman was simply asleep.",
        "How quickly it had all been done!  He felt strangely calm, and,\nwalking over to the window, opened it, and stepped out on the\nbalcony.  The wind had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a\nmonstrous peacock’s tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes.  He\nlooked down, and saw the policeman going his rounds and flashing a\nbull’s-eye lantern on the doors of the silent houses.  The crimson\nspot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner, and then vanished.\nA woman in a ragged shawl was creeping round by the railings,\nstaggering as she went.  Now and then she stopped, and peered back.\nOnce, she began to sing in a hoarse voice.  The policeman strolled\nover and said something to her.  She stumbled away, laughing.  A\nbitter blast swept across the Square.  The gas-lamps flickered, and\nbecame blue, and the leafless trees shook their black iron branches\nas if in pain.  He shivered, and went back, closing the window behind\nhim.",
        "He passed to the door, turned the key, and opened it.  He did not\neven glance at the murdered man.  He felt that the secret of the\nwhole thing was not to realize the situation.  The friend who had\npainted [85] the fatal portrait, the portrait to which all his misery\nhad been due, had gone out of his life.  That was enough.",
        "Then he remembered the lamp.  It was a rather curious one of Moorish\nworkmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished\nsteel.  Perhaps it might be missed by his servant, and questions\nwould be asked.  He turned back, and took it from the table.  How\nstill the man was!  How horribly white the long hands looked!  He was\nlike a dreadful wax image.",
        "He locked the door behind him, and crept quietly down-stairs.  The\nwood-work creaked, and seemed to cry out as if in pain.  He stopped\nseveral times, and waited.  No: everything was still.  It was merely\nthe sound of his own footsteps.",
        "When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.\nThey must be hidden away somewhere.  He unlocked a secret press that\nwas in the wainscoting, and put them into it.  He could easily burn\nthem afterwards.  Then he pulled out his watch.  It was twenty\nminutes to two.",
        "He sat down, and began to think.  Every year–every month, almost–\nmen were strangled in England for what he had done.  There had been a\nmadness of murder in the air.  Some red star had come too close to\nthe earth.",
        "Evidence?  What evidence was there against him?  Basil Hallward had\nleft the house at eleven.  No one had seen him come in again.  Most\nof the servants were at Selby Royal.  His valet had gone to bed.",
        "Paris!  Yes.  It was to Paris that Basil had gone, by the midnight\ntrain, as he had intended.  With his curious reserved habits, it\nwould be months before any suspicions would be aroused.  Months?\nEverything could be destroyed long before then.",
        "A sudden thought struck him.  He put on his fur coat and hat, and\nwent out into the hall.  There he paused, hearing the slow heavy\ntread of the policeman outside on the pavement, and seeing the flash\nof the lantern reflected in the window.  He waited, holding his\nbreath.",
        "After a few moments he opened the front door, and slipped out,\nshutting it very gently behind him.  Then he began ringing the bell.\nIn about ten minutes his valet appeared, half dressed, and looking\nvery drowsy.",
        "“I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,” he said, stepping\nin; “but I had forgotten my latch-key.  What time is it?”",
        "“Five minutes past two, sir,” answered the man, looking at the clock\nand yawning.",
        "“Five minutes past two?  How horribly late!  You must wake me at nine\nto-morrow.  I have some work to do.”",
        "“All right, sir.”",
        "“Did any one call this evening?”",
        "“Mr. Hallward, sir.  He stayed here till eleven, and then he went\naway to catch his train.”",
        "“Oh!  I am sorry I didn’t see him.  Did he leave any message?”",
        "“No, sir, except that he would write to you.”",
        "[86] “That will do, Francis.  Don’t forget to call me at nine\ntomorrow.”",
        "“No, sir.”",
        "The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.",
        "Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the yellow marble table, and\npassed into the library.  He walked up and down the room for a\nquarter of an hour, biting his lip, and thinking.  Then he took the\nBlue Book down from one of the shelves, and began to turn over the\nleaves.  “Alan Campbell, 152, Hertford Street, Mayfair.”  Yes; that\nwas the man he wanted.",
