        "This is the worst of all the ideas embodied by DRM: that people\nwho make record-players should be able to spec whose records you\ncan listen to, and that people who make records should have a\nveto over the design of record-players.",
        "We’ve never had this principle: in fact, we’ve always had just\nthe reverse. Think about all the things that can be plugged into\na parallel or serial interface, which were never envisioned by\ntheir inventors. Our strong economy and rapid innovation are\nbyproducts of the ability of anyone to make anything that plugs\ninto anything else: from the Flo-bee electric razor that snaps\nonto the end of your vacuum-hose to the octopus spilling out of\nyour car’s dashboard lighter socket, standard interfaces that\nanyone can build for are what makes billionaires out of nerds.",
        "The courts affirm this again and again. It used to be illegal to\nplug anything that didn’t come from AT&T into your phone-jack.\nThey claimed that this was for the safety of the network, but\nreally it was about propping up this little penny-ante racket\nthat AT&T had in charging you a rental fee for your phone until\nyou’d paid for it a thousand times over.",
        "When that ban was struck down, it created the market for\nthird-party phone equipment, from talking novelty phones to\nanswering machines to cordless handsets to headsets – billions\nof dollars of economic activity that had been supressed by the\nclosed interface. Note that AT&T was one of the big beneficiaries\nof this: they also got into the business of making phone-kit.",
        "DRM is the software equivalent of these closed hardware\ninterfaces. Robert Scoble is a Softie who has an excellent blog,\nwhere he wrote an essay about the best way to protect your\ninvestment in the digital music you buy. Should you buy Apple\niTunes music, or Microsoft DRM music? Scoble argued that\nMicrosoft’s music was a sounder investment, because Microsoft\nwould have more downstream licensees for its proprietary format\nand therefore you’d have a richer ecosystem of devices to choose\nfrom when you were shopping for gizmos to play your virtual\nrecords on.",
        "What a weird idea: that we should evaluate our record-purchases\non the basis of which recording company will allow the greatest\ndiversity of record-players to play its discs! That’s like\ntelling someone to buy the Betamax instead of the Edison\nKinetoscope because Thomas Edison is a crank about licensing his\npatents; all the while ignoring the world’s relentless march to\nthe more open VHS format.",
        "It’s a bad business. DVD is a format where the guy who makes the\nrecords gets to design the record players. Ask yourself: how much\ninnovation has there been over the past decade of DVD players?\nThey’ve gotten cheaper and smaller, but where are the weird and\namazing new markets for DVD that were opened up by the VCR?\nThere’s a company that’s manufacturing the world’s first\nHDD-based DVD jukebox, a thing that holds 30 movies, and they’re\ncharging $30,000 for this thing. We’re talking about a $300\nhard drive and a $300 PC – all that other cost is the cost of\nanticompetition.",
