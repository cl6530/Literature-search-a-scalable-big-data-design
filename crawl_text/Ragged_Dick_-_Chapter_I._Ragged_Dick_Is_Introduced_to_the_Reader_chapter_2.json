        "“Wake up there, youngster,” said a rough voice.",
        "Ragged Dick opened his eyes slowly, and stared stupidly in the face\nof the speaker, but did not offer to get up.",
        "“Wake up, you young vagabond!” said the man a little impatiently;\n“I suppose you’d lay there all day, if I hadn’t called you.”",
        "“What time is it?” asked Dick.",
        "“Seven o’clock.”",
        "“Seven o’clock! I oughter’ve been up an hour ago. I know what ’twas\nmade me so precious sleepy. I went to the Old Bowery last night, and\ndidn’t turn in till past twelve.”",
        "“You went to the Old Bowery? Where’d you get your money?” asked the\nman, who was a porter in the employ of a firm doing business on\nSpruce Street. “Made it by shines, in course. My guardian don’t\nallow me no money for theatres, so I have to earn it.”",
        "“Some boys get it easier than that,” said the porter significantly.",
        "“You don’t catch me stealin’, if that’s what you mean,” said Dick.",
        "“Don’t you ever steal, then?”",
        "“No, and I wouldn’t. Lots of boys does it, but I wouldn’t.”",
        "“Well, I’m glad to hear you say that. I believe there’s some\ngood in you, Dick, after all.”",
        "“Oh, I’m a rough customer!” said Dick. “But I wouldn’t steal.\nIt’s mean.”",
        "“I’m glad you think so, Dick,” and the rough voice sounded gentler\nthan at first. “Have you got any money to buy your breakfast?”",
        "“No, but I’ll soon get some.”",
        "While this conversation had been going on, Dick had got up. His\nbedchamber had been a wooden box half full of straw, on which the\nyoung boot-black had reposed his weary limbs, and slept as soundly\nas if it had been a bed of down. He dumped down into the straw\nwithout taking the trouble of undressing.",
        "Getting up too was an equally short process. He jumped out of the\nbox, shook himself, picked out one or two straws that had found\ntheir way into rents in his clothes, and, drawing a well-worn cap\nover his uncombed locks, he was all ready for the business of the\nday.",
        "Dick’s appearance as he stood beside the box was rather peculiar.\nHis pants were torn in several places, and had apparently belonged\nin the first instance to a boy two sizes larger than himself. He\nwore a vest, all the buttons of which were gone except two, out of\nwhich peeped a shirt which looked as if it had been worn a month.\nTo complete his costume he wore a coat too long for him, dating\nback, if one might judge from its general appearance, to a remote\nantiquity.",
        "Washing the face and hands is usually considered proper in\ncommencing the day, but Dick was above such refinement. He had no\nparticular dislike to dirt, and did not think it necessary to remove\nseveral dark streaks on his face and hands. But in spite of his dirt\nand rags there was something about Dick that was attractive. It was\neasy to see that if he had been clean and well dressed he would\nhave been decidedly good-looking. Some of his companions were sly,\nand their faces inspired distrust; but Dick had a frank,\nstraight-forward manner that made him a favorite.",
        "Dick’s business hours had commenced. He had no office to open. His\nlittle blacking-box was ready for use, and he looked sharply in\nthe faces of all who passed, addressing each with, “Shine yer\nboots, sir?”",
        "“How much?” asked a gentleman on his way to his office.",
        "“Ten cents,” said Dick, dropping his box, and sinking upon his knees\non the sidewalk, flourishing his brush with the air of one skilled\nin his profession.",
        "“Ten cents! Isn’t that a little steep?”",
        "“Well, you know ’taint all clear profit,” said Dick, who had already\nset to work. “There’s the blacking costs something, and I have to\nget a new brush pretty often.”",
        "“And you have a large rent too,” said the gentleman quizzically,\nwith a glance at a large hole in Dick’s coat.",
        "“Yes, sir,” said Dick, always ready to joke; “I have to pay such a\nbig rent for my manshun up on Fifth Avenoo, that I can’t afford to\ntake less than ten cents a shine. I’ll give you a bully shine, sir.”",
        "“Be quick about it, for I am in a hurry. So your house is on Fifth\nAvenue, is it?”",
        "“It isn’t anywhere else,” said Dick, and Dick spoke the truth there.",
        "“What tailor do you patronize?” asked the gentleman,\nsurveying Dick’s attire.",
        "“Would you like to go to the same one?” asked Dick, shrewdly.",
        "“Well, no; it strikes me that he didn’t give you a very good fit.”",
        "“This coat once belonged to General Washington,” said Dick,\ncomically. “He wore it all through the Revolution, and it got torn\nsome, ’cause he fit so hard. When he died he told his widder to give\nit to some smart young feller that hadn’t got none of his own; so\nshe gave it to me. But if you’d like it, sir, to remember General\nWashington by, I’ll let you have it reasonable.”",
        "“Thank you, but I wouldn’t want to deprive you of it. And did your\npants come from General Washington too?”",
        "“No, they was a gift from Lewis Napoleon. Lewis had outgrown ’em\nand sent ’em to me,–he’s bigger than me, and that’s why they\ndon’t fit.”",
        "“It seems you have distinguished friends. Now, my lad, I suppose you\nwould like your money.”",
        "“I shouldn’t have any objection,” said Dick.",
        "“I believe,” said the gentleman, examining his pocket-book, “I\nhaven’t got anything short of twenty-five cents. Have you got\nany change?”",
        "“Not a cent,” said Dick. “All my money’s invested in the Erie\nRailroad.”",
        "“That’s unfortunate.”",
        "“Shall I get the money changed, sir?”",
        "“I can’t wait; I’ve got to meet an appointment immediately. I’ll\nhand you twenty-five cents, and you can leave the change at my\noffice any time during the day.”",
        "“All right, sir. Where is it?”",
        "“No. 125 Fulton Street. Shall you remember?”",
        "“Yes, sir. What name?”",
        "“Greyson,–office on second floor.”",
        "“All right, sir; I’ll bring it.”",
        "“I wonder whether the little scamp will prove honest,” said Mr.\nGreyson to himself, as he walked away. “If he does, I’ll give him\nmy custom regularly. If he don’t as is most likely, I shan’t mind\nthe loss of fifteen cents.”",
        "Mr. Greyson didn’t understand Dick. Our ragged hero wasn’t a model\nboy in all respects. I am afraid he swore sometimes, and now and\nthen he played tricks upon unsophisticated boys from the country,\nor gave a wrong direction to honest old gentlemen unused to the\ncity. A clergyman in search of the Cooper Institute he once directed\nto the Tombs Prison, and, following him unobserved, was highly\ndelighted when the unsuspicious stranger walked up the front steps\nof the great stone building on Centre Street, and tried to obtain\nadmission.",
        "“I guess he wouldn’t want to stay long if he did get in,” thought\nRagged Dick, hitching up his pants. “Leastways I shouldn’t. They’re\nso precious glad to see you that they won’t let you go, but board\nyou gratooitous, and never send in no bills.”",
        "Another of Dick’s faults was his extravagance. Being always\nwide-awake and ready for business, he earned enough to have\nsupported him comfortably and respectably. There were not a few\nyoung clerks who employed Dick from time to time in his professional\ncapacity, who scarcely earned as much as he, greatly as their style\nand dress exceeded his. But Dick was careless of his earnings. Where\nthey went he could hardly have told himself. However much he managed\nto earn during the day, all was generally spent before morning. He\nwas fond of going to the Old Bowery Theatre, and to Tony Pastor’s,\nand if he had any money left afterwards, he would invite some of\nhis friends in somewhere to have an oyster-stew; so it seldom\nhappened that he commenced the day with a penny.",
        "Then I am sorry to add that Dick had formed the habit of smoking.\nThis cost him considerable, for Dick was rather fastidious about his\ncigars, and wouldn’t smoke the cheapest. Besides, having a liberal\nnature, he was generally ready to treat his companions. But of\ncourse the expense was the smallest objection. No boy of fourteen\ncan smoke without being affected injuriously. Men are frequently\ninjured by smoking, and boys always. But large numbers of the\nnewsboys and boot-blacks form the habit. Exposed to the cold and wet\nthey find that it warms them up, and the self-indulgence grows upon\nthem. It is not uncommon to see a little boy, too young to be out\nof his mother’s sight, smoking with all the apparent satisfaction\nof a veteran smoker.",
        "There was another way in which Dick sometimes lost money. There was\na noted gambling-house on Baxter Street, which in the evening was\nsometimes crowded with these juvenile gamesters, who staked their\nhard earnings, generally losing of course, and refreshing themselves\nfrom time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cents a\nglass. Sometimes Dick strayed in here, and played with the rest.",
        "I have mentioned Dick’s faults and defects, because I want it\nunderstood, to begin with, that I don’t consider him a model boy.\nBut there were some good points about him nevertheless. He was above\ndoing anything mean or dishonorable. He would not steal, or cheat,\nor impose upon younger boys, but was frank and straight-forward,\nmanly and self-reliant. His nature was a noble one, and had saved\nhim from all mean faults. I hope my young readers will like him as\nI do, without being blind to his faults. Perhaps, although he was\nonly a boot-black, they may find something in him to imitate.",
        "And now, having fairly introduced Ragged Dick to my young readers,\nI must refer them to the next chapter for his further adventures.",
