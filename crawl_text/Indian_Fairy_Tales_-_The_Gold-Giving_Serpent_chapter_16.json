        "Now in a certain place there lived a Brahman named Haridatta. He was a\nfarmer, but poor was the return his labour brought him. One day, at the\nend of the hot hours, the Brahman, overcome by the heat, lay down under\nthe shadow of a tree to have a doze. Suddenly he saw a great hooded\nsnake creeping out of an ant-hill near at hand. So he thought to\nhimself, “Sure this is the guardian deity of the field, and I have not\never worshipped it. That’s why my farming is in vain. I will at once go\nand pay my respects to it.”",
        "When he had made up his mind, he got some milk, poured it into a bowl,\nand went to the ant-hill, and said aloud: “O Guardian of this Field!\nall this while I did not know that you dwelt here. That is why I have\nnot yet paid my respects to you; pray forgive me.” And he laid the milk\ndown and went to his house. Next morning he came and looked, and he saw\na gold denar in the bowl, and from that time onward every day the same\nthing occurred he gave milk to the serpent and found a gold denar.",
        "One day the Brahman had to go to the village, and so he ordered his son\nto take the milk to the ant-hill. The son brought the milk, put it\ndown, and went back home. Next day he went again and found a denar, so\nhe thought to himself: “This ant-hill is surely full of golden denars;\nI’ll kill the serpent, and take them all for myself.” So next day,\nwhile he was giving the milk to the serpent, the Brahman’s son struck\nit on the head with a cudgel. But the serpent escaped death by the will\nof fate, and in a rage bit the Brahman’s son with its sharp fangs, and\nhe fell down dead at once. His people raised him a funeral pyre not far\nfrom the field and burnt him to ashes.",
        "Two days afterwards his father came back, and when he learnt his son’s\nfate he grieved and mourned. But after a time, he took the bowl of\nmilk, went to the ant-hill, and praised the serpent with a loud voice.\nAfter a long, long time the serpent appeared, but only with its head\nout of the opening of the ant-hill, and spoke to the Brahman: “’Tis\ngreed that brings you here, and makes you even forget the loss of your\nson. From this time forward friendship between us is impossible. Your\nson struck me in youthful ignorance, and I have bitten him to death.\nHow can I forget the blow with the cudgel? And how can you forget the\npain and grief at the loss of your son?” So speaking, it gave the\nBrahman a costly pearl and disappeared. But before it went away it\nsaid: “Come back no more.” The Brahman took the pearl, and went back\nhome, cursing the folly of his son.",
