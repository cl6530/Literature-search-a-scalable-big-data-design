        "\nPlots are either simple or complex, since the actions they represent\nare naturally of this twofold description. The action, proceeding in\nthe way defined, as one continuous whole, I call simple, when the\nchange in the hero’s fortunes takes place without Peripety or\nDiscovery; and complex, when it involves one or the other, or both.\nThese should each of them arise out of the structure of the Plot\nitself, so as to be the consequence, necessary or probable, of the\nantecedents. There is a great difference between a thing happening\npropter hoc and post hoc.",
