        "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice,\n\"without pictures or conversations?”",
        "So she was considering, in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.",
        "There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think\nit so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!” (when she thought it over\nafterward, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,\nbut at the time it all seemed quite natural); but, when the Rabbit\nactually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it,\nand then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across\nher mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a\nwaistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with\ncuriosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to\nsee it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.",
        "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.",
        "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down what\nseemed to be a very deep well.",
        "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled\nwith cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and\npictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves\nas she passed: it was labeled “ORANGE MARMALADE,” but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for\nfear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of\nthe cupboards as she fell past it.",
        "“Well!” thought Alice to herself. “After such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling downstairs! How brave they’ll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)",
        "Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had\nlearned several things of this sort in her lessons in the school-room,\nand though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had not\nthe slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she\nthought they were nice grand words to say).",
        "Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\nglad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand? Or\nAustralia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy, curtseying\nas you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?)\n\"And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No,\nit’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”",
        "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\"\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to her, very\nearnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\"\nwhen suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and\ndry leaves, and the fall was over.",
        "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\nmoment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead: before her was\nanother long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight,\nhurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice\nlike the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a\ncorner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was\nclose behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no\nlonger to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was\nlit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.",
        "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and\nwhen Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying\nevery door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was\never to get out again.",
        "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass: there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\nfirst idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before,\nand behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried\nthe little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",
        "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I\nonly knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\nhad happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\nthings indeed were really impossible.",
        "",
        "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\ntime she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly was not here\nbefore,” said Alice), and tied round the neck of the bottle was a\npaper label, with the words “DRINK ME” beautifully printed on it in\nlarge letters.",
        "It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\nnot going to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\n\"and see whether it’s marked ’poison’ or not\"; for she had read\nseveral nice little stories about children who had got burned, and\neaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they\nwould not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\nand that, if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\nsooner or later.",
        "However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured\nto taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of\nmixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy,\nand hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.",
        "“What a curious feeling!” said Alice. “I must be shutting up like a\ntelescope!”",
        "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any\nfurther: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you\nknow,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a\ncandle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy\nwhat the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out,\nfor she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.",
        "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on\ngoing into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got\nto the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and\nwhen she went back to the table for it, she found she could not\npossibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass,\nand she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but\nit was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying,\nthe poor little thing sat down and cried.",
        "“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself\nrather sharply. “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\ngave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it),\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for\nhaving cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against\nherself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two\npeople. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be\ntwo people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one\nrespectable person!”",
        "Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the\ntable: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the\nwords “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat\nit,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key;\nand if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either\nway I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”",
        "She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\nway?” holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the\nsame size. To be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats\ncake; but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but\nout-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid\nfor life to go on in the common way.",
        "So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",
        "“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised,\nthat for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English). “Now\nI’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-by,\nfeet!” (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost\nout of sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet,\nI wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?\nI’m sure I shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off\nto trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can—but\nI must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk\nthe way I want to go! Let me see. I’ll give them a new pair of boots\nevery Christmas.”",
        "And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They\nmust go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem,\nsending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will\nlook!",
        "Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”",
        "Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall: in\nfact she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took\nup the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.",
        "Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.",
        "“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\nyou” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!”",
        "But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there\nwas a large pool all round her, about four inches deep, and reaching\nhalf down the hall.",
        "After a time she heard a little pattering of feet. In the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself, as he came, “Oh! The Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! Won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!”",
        "",
        "Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one: so,\nwhen the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If\nyou please, Sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white\nkid-gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\nas he could go.",
        "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking. “Dear, dear!\nHow queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as\nusual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was\nI the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember\nfeeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question\nis, ’Who in the world am I?’ Ah, that’s the great puzzle!”",
        "And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the\nsame age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of\nthem.",
        "“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh, she knows such\na very little! Besides, she’s she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication-Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ’How doth the little—,’” and\nshe crossed her hands on her lap, as if she were saying lessons, and\nbegan to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the\nwords did not come the same as they used to do:—",
        "“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her\neyes filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after\nall, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and\nhave next to no toys to play with, and oh, ever so many lessons to\nlearn! No, I’ve made up my mind about it: if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down\nhere! It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying, ’Come\nup again, dear!’ I shall only look up and say, ’Who am I, then? Tell\nme that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if\nnot, I’ll stay down here till I am somebody else’—but, oh dear!\"\ncried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, “I do wish they would put\ntheir heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!”",
        "As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to\nsee that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid-gloves\nwhile she was talking.",
        "“How can I have done that?” she thought. “I must be growing small\nagain.” She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and\nfound that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet\nhigh, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the\ncause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily,\njust in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether.",
        "“That was a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at\nthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence.\n\"And now for the garden!” And she ran with all speed back to the\nlittle door; but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little\ngolden key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are\nworse than ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as\nthis before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”",
        "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt-water.",
        "",
        "Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in\nthat case I can go back by railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had\nbeen to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general\nconclusion that, wherever you go to on the English coast, you find a\nnumber of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the\nsand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging-houses, and behind them\na railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the\npool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.",
        "“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”",
        "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.",
        "“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the\nright way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing\nbefore, but she remembered having seen, in her brother’s Latin\nGrammar, “A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”)",
        "The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to\nwink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.",
        "“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice. “I dare say\nit’s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For with\nall her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long\nago anything had happened.)",
        "So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which was the first sentence\nin her French lesson-book.",
        "The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver\nall over with fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily,\nafraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot\nyou didn’t like cats.”",
        "“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\nyou like cats if you were me?”",
        "“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you’d\ntake a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\nabout her any more, if you’d rather not.”",
        "“We, indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of\nits tail. “As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always\nhated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\nagain!”",
        "“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject\nof conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did\nnot answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little\ndog, near our house, I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed\nterrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll\nfetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its\ndinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it\nbelongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth\na hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats, and—oh dear!” cried\nAlice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For\nthe Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and\nmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went.",
        "So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon’t talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When\nthe Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its\nface was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said, in a\nlow trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you\nmy history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”",
        "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with\nthe birds and animals that had fallen into it: there was a Duck and a\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.",
        "Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",
        "They were, indeed, a queer-looking party that assembled on the\nbank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur\nclinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and\nuncomfortable.",
        "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I’m\nolder than you, and must know better.”",
        "And this Alice would not allow, without knowing how old it was, and,\nas the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to\nbe said.",
        "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among\nthem, called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon\nmake you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with\nthe Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it,\nfor she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry\nvery soon.",
        "“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air. “Are you all ready? This\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ’William\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\nMercia and Northumbria—’”",
        "“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.",
        "“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely. “Did\nyou speak?”",
        "“Not I!” said the Lory, hastily.",
        "“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “I proceed. ’Edwin and Morcar,\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him; and even\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it\nadvisable—’”",
        "“Found what!” said the Duck.",
        "“Found it,” the Mouse replied, rather crossly: “of course you\nknow what ’it’ means.”",
        "“I know what ’it’ means well enough, when I find a thing,” said the\nDuck; “it’s generally a frog, or a worm. The question is, what did the\narchbishop find?”",
        "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,\n\"’—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and\noffer him the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the\ninsolence of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it\ncontinued, turning to Alice as it spoke.",
        "“As wet as ever,” said Alice, in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem\nto dry me at all.”",
        "“In that case,” said the Dodo, solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\nremedies—”",
        "“Speak English!” said Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half those\nlong words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And the\nEaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\ntittered audibly.",
        "“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”",
        "“What is a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she much wanted to\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought\nto speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.",
        "“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)",
        "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle (\"the exact\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said), and then all the party were placed\nalong the course, here and there.",
        "There was no “One, two, three, and away!” but they began running when\nthey liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to\nknow when the race was over. However, when they had been running half\nan hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out\n\"The race is over!” and they all crowded round it, panting, and\nasking, “But who has won?”",
        "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it stood for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.",
        "At last the Dodo said, “Everybody has won, and all must have\nprizes.”",
        "“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.",
        "“Why, she, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out, in\na confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”",
        "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt water had\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\none a-piece, all round.",
        "“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.",
        "“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\nyour pocket?” it went on, turning to Alice.",
        "“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.",
        "“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.",
        "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\npresented the thimble, saying:",
        "“We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble\"; and, when it had\nfinished this short speech, they all cheered.",
        "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so\ngrave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of\nanything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as\nsolemn as she could.",
        "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.",
        "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.",
        "“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\nit is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\nwould be offended again.",
        "“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\nsighing.",
        "“It is a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\nat the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of\nthe tale was something like this:",
        "“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice, severely. “What are\nyou thinking of?”",
        "“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\nbend, I think?”",
        "“I had not!” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.",
        "“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\nanxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”",
        "“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\nwalking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”",
        "“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily\noffended, you know!”",
        "The Mouse only growled in reply.",
        "“Please come back, and finish your story!” Alice called after it. And\nthe others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” But the Mouse only\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.",
        "“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\nquite out of sight. And an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\nher daughter, “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\nyour temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a\nlittle snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”",
        "“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\naddressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”",
        "“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\nLory.",
        "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\n\"Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice, you\ncan’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\nshe’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”",
        "This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up\nvery carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home: the\nnight-air doesn’t suit my throat!” And a Canary called out in a\ntrembling voice to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time\nyou were all in bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and\nAlice was soon left alone.",
        "“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\ntone. “Nobody seems to like her down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\nany more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard\na little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\ncoming back to finish his story.",
        "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\nit muttering to itself, “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\nmy fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\nferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in\na moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white\nkid-gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them,\nbut they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed\nsince her swim in the pool; and the great hall, with the glass table\nand the little door, had vanished completely.",
        "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\ncalled out to her, in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what are you\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves\nand a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran\noff at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain\nthe mistake that it had made.",
        "“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this,\nshe came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright\nbrass plate with the name “W. RABBIT” engraved upon it. She went in\nwithout knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should\nmeet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had\nfound the fan and gloves.",
        "“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “’Miss Alice! Come\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ’Coming in a minute,\nnurse! But I’ve got to watch this mouse-hole till Dinah comes back,\nand see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I don’t think,” Alice\nwent on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering\npeople about like that!”",
        "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a\ntable in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or\nthree pairs of tiny white kid-gloves: she took up the fan and a pair\nof the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell\nupon a little bottle that stood near the looking glass. There was no\nlabel this time with the words, “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she\nuncorked it and put it to her lips.",
        "“I know something interesting is sure to happen,” she said to\nherself, “whenever I eat or drink anything: so I’ll just see what this\nbottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for really I’m\nquite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”",
        "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she\nhad drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the\nceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She\nhastily put down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I\nhope I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I\ndo wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!”",
        "Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down\nwith one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her\nhead. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one\narm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to\nherself, “Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become\nof me?”",
        "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full\neffect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and,\nas there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the\nroom again, no wonder she felt unhappy.",
        "“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and\nyet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do\nwonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairy\ntales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am\nin the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that\nthere ought! And when I grow up I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now\"\nshe added in a sorrowful tone: “at least there’s no room to grow up\nany more here.”",
        "“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I never get any older than I\nam now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\nthen—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like that!”",
        "“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\nlessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for you, and no room at\nall for any lesson books!”",
        "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.",
        "“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this\nmoment!” Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice\nknew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till\nshe shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a\nthousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid\nof it.",
        "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but,\nas the door opened inward, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against\nit, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, “Then\nI’ll go round and get in at the window.”",
        "“That you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out\nher hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of\nanything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of\nbroken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it\nhad fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.",
        "Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\nthen a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\nfor apples, yer honor!”",
        "“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit, angrily. “Here! Come\nand help me out of this!” (Sounds of more broken glass.)",
        "“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”",
        "“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honor!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)",
        "“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the\nwhole window!”",
        "“Sure, it does, yer honor: but it’s an arm for all that.”",
        "“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”",
        "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear\nwhispers now and then; such as “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honor, at\nall, at all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread\nout her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time\nthere were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass.\n\"What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I\nwonder what they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I\nonly wish they could! I’m sure I don’t want to stay in here any\nlonger!”",
        "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came\na rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\nall talking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\nladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one. Bill’s got the other—Bill!\nFetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\ntogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh, they’ll do\nwell enough. Don’t be particular—Here, Bill! Catch hold of this\nrope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming\ndown! Heads below!” (a loud crash)—\"Now, who did that?—It was Bill,\nI fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, I shan’t! You do\nit!—That I won’t, then!—Bill’s got to go down—Here, Bill!\nThe master says you’ve got to go down the chimney!”",
        "“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\nherself. “Why, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure;\nbut I think I can kick a little!”",
        "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited\ntill she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it\nwas) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her:\nthen, saying to herself, “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and\nwaited to see what would happen next.",
        "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of, “There goes Bill!\"\nthen the Rabbit’s voice alone—\"Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—\"Hold up his head—Brandy\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you?\nTell us all about it!”",
        "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice (\"That’s Bill,” thought\nAlice), “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but\nI’m a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes\nat me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”",
        "“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.",
        "“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice. And Alice\ncalled out, as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”",
        "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\nwonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they’d take\nthe roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again,\nand Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”",
        "“A barrowful of what?” thought Alice. But she had not long to\ndoubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in\nat the window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop\nto this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do\nthat again!” which produced another dead silence.",
        "Alice noticed, with some surprise, that the pebbles were all turning\ninto little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came\ninto her head. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure\nto make some change in my size; and, as it can’t possibly make me\nlarger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.”",
        "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard,\nBill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were\ngiving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the\nmoment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon\nfound herself safe in a thick wood.",
        "“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\nwandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and\nthe second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think\nthat will be the best plan.”",
        "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\narranged: the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\nhow to set about it; and, while she was peering about anxiously among\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in\na great hurry.",
        "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\nthing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle\nto it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought\nthat it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat\nher up in spite of all her coaxing.",
        "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\nheld it out to the puppy: whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\nand made believe to worry it: then Alice dodged behind a great\nthistle, to keep herself from being run over; and, the moment she\nappeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick,\nand tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it: then\nAlice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a\ncart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet,\nran round the thistle again: then the puppy began a series of short\ncharges at the stick, running a very little way forward each time and\na long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it\nsat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its\nmouth, and its great eyes half shut.",
        "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape: so she\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\nand till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.",
        "“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leaned\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of\nthe leaves. “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if\nI’d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten\nthat I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how is it to be managed?\nI suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\nquestion is, ’What?’”",
        "The great question certainly was “What?” Alice looked all round her at\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she could not see anything\nthat looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the\ncircumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the\nsame height as herself; and, when she had looked under it, and on both\nsides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well\nlook and see what was on the top of it.",
        "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with his arms folded,\nquietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of\nher or of anything else.",
        "",
        "The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.",
        "“Who are you?” said the Caterpillar.",
        "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, Sir, just at present—at least I know\nwho I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have\nchanged several times since then.”",
        "“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar, sternly. “Explain\nyourself!”",
        "“I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, Sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\nnot myself, you see.”",
        "“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied, very\npolitely, “for I can’t understand it myself, to begin with; and being\nso many different sizes in a day is very confusing.”",
        "“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\nqueer, won’t you?”",
        "“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice: “all I\nknow is, it would feel very queer to me.”",
        "“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are you?”",
        "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.",
        "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such very\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\nthink you ought to tell me who you are, first.”",
        "“Why?” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Here was another puzzling question; and, as Alice could not think of\nany good reason, and the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very\nunpleasant state of mind, she turned away.",
        "“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\nimportant to say!”",
        "This sounded promising, certainly. Alice turned and came back again.",
        "“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\ncould.",
        "“No,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking; but at last it unfolded\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\nthink you’re changed, do you?”",
        "“I’m afraid I am, Sir,” said Alice. “I can’t remember things as I\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”",
        "“Can’t remember what things?” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, I’ve tried to say, ’How doth the little busy bee,’ but it all\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.",
        "“Repeat, ’You are old, Father William,’” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice folded her hands, and began:",
        "“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Not quite right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly: “some of the\nwords have got altered.”",
        "“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar, decidedly;\nand there was silence for some minutes.",
        "The Caterpillar was the first to speak.",
        "“What size do you want to be?” it asked.",
        "“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”",
        "“I don’t know,” said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in all her\nlife before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.",
        "“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.",
        "“Well, I should like to be a little larger, Sir, if you wouldn’t\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”",
        "“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).",
        "“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And\nshe thought to herself, “I wish the creature wouldn’t be so easily\noffended!”",
        "“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\nhookah into its mouth, and began smoking again.",
        "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\nmushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it\nwent, “One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will\nmake you grow shorter.”",
        "“One side of what? The other side of what?” thought Alice to\nherself.",
        "“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.",
        "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it;—and, as it was\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However,\nat last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and\nbroke off a bit of the edge with each hand.",
        "“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect.",
        "The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had\nstruck her foot!",
        "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she\nfelt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly:\nso she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was\npressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to\nopen her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a\nmorsel of the left-hand bit.",
        "“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her\nshoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked\ndown, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk\nout a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.",
        "“What can all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where have my\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?\"\nShe was moving them about, as she spoke, but no result seemed to\nfollow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",
        "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to\nfind that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a\nserpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful\nzigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to\nbe nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been\nwandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large\npigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its\nwings.",
        "“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.",
        "“I’m not a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”",
        "“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\ntone, and added, with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, but\nnothing seems to suit them!”",
        "“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.",
        "“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\nhedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\nserpents! There’s no pleasing them!”",
        "Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.",
        "“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\n\"but I must be on the lookout for serpents, night and day! Why, I\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”",
        "“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.",
        "“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”",
        "“But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice, “I’m a—I’m a—”",
        "“Well! What are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\ninvent something!”",
        "“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she\nremembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.",
        "“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon, in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\none with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\nno use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!”",
        "“I have tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\nchild; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\nknow.”",
        "“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why, then\nthey’re a kind of serpent: that’s all I can say.”",
        "This was such a new idea to Alice that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding,\n\"You’re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it\nmatter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”",
        "“It matters a good deal to me,” said Alice, hastily; “but I’m not\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and, if I was, I shouldn’t want\nyours: I don’t like them raw.”",
        "“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her\nhands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and\nthen at the other, and growing sometimes taller, and sometimes\nshorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual\nheight.",
        "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\nand began talking to herself, as usual, “Come, there’s half my plan\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\nis that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n\"Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon\nthem this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So\nshe began nibbling at the right-hand bit again, and did not venture to\ngo near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches\nhigh.",
        "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\nfish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened\nby another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.",
        "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”",
        "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.",
        "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\nfor fear of their hearing her; and, when she next peeped out, the\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near\nthe door, staring stupidly up into the sky.",
        "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.",
        "“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\ntwo reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\nare: secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one\ncould possibly hear you.” And certainly there was a most\nextraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing,\nand every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been\nbroken to pieces.",
        "“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”",
        "“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on,\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For\ninstance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you\nout, you know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was\nspeaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he\ncan’t help it,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so very nearly at\nthe top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions—How am\nI to get in?” she repeated, aloud.",
        "“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till to-morrow—”",
        "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.",
        "“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone,\nexactly as if nothing had happened.",
        "“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.",
        "“Are you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\nquestion, you know.”",
        "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\nIt’s enough to drive one crazy!”",
        "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\ndays and days.”",
        "“But what am I to do?” said Alice.",
        "“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.",
        "“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.",
        "",
        "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\none end to the other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\nin the middle, nursing a baby: the cook was leaning over the fire,\nstirring a large caldron which seemed to be full of soup.",
        "“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.",
        "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess\nsneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moment’s pause. The only two creatures in the\nkitchen, that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat, which\nwas lying on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.",
        "“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first,\n\"why your cat grins like that?”",
        "“It’s a Cheshire-Cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”",
        "",
        "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:",
        "“I didn’t know that Cheshire-Cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\nknow that cats would grin.”",
        "“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”",
        "“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said, very politely, feeling\nquite pleased to have got into a conversation.",
        "“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”",
        "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it\nwould be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.\nWhile she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the caldron of soup\noff the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her\nreach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then\nfollowed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took\nno notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so\nmuch already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows\nhurt it or not.",
        "“Oh, please mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and\ndown in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his precious nose!” as\nan unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried\nit off.",
        "“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said, in a\nhoarse growl, “the world would go around a deal faster than it does.”",
        "“Which would not be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\nthink what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”",
        "“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”",
        "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to\ntake the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed\nnot to be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I\nthink; or is it twelve? I—”",
        "“Oh, don’t bother me!” said the Duchess. “I never could abide\nfigures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\nthe end of every line:—",
        "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:",
        "“Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to\nAlice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready\nto play croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The\ncook threw a frying-pan after her as she went, but it just missed her.",
        "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\n\"just like a star fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",
        "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself), she carried\nit out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,\"\nthought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two. Wouldn’t it\nbe murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and\nthe little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this\ntime). “Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\nexpressing yourself.”",
        "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it\nhad a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose:\nalso its eyes were getting extremely small for I a baby: altogether\nAlice did not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was\nonly sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if\nthere were any tears.",
        "No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear\"\nsaid Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\nnow!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was\nimpossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.",
        "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\nwith this creature, when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\nthere could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less\nthan a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to\ncarry it any further.",
        "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\nherself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of\na tree a few yards off.",
        "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\nthought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.",
        "“Cheshire-Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\nwider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on:\n\"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”",
        "“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.",
        "“I don’t much care where—,” said Alice.",
        "“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.",
        "“—so long as I get somewhere,” Alice added as an explanation.",
        "“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\nenough.”",
        "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\nquestion. “What sort of people live about here?”",
        "“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round,\n\"lives a Hatter: and in that direction,” waving the other paw,\n\"lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”",
        "“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.",
        "“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\nYou’re mad.”",
        "“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.",
        "“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”",
        "Alice didn’t think that proved it at all: however, she went on: “And\nhow do you know that you’re mad?”",
        "“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”",
        "“I suppose so,” said Alice.",
        "“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see a dog growls when it’s angry,\nand wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased,\nand wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”",
        "“I call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.",
        "“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\nQueen to-day?”",
        "“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\nyet.”",
        "“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.",
        "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so well used to\nqueer things happening. While she was still looking at the place where\nit had been, it suddenly appeared again.",
        "“By the by, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\nforgotten to ask.”",
        "“It turned into a pig,” Alice answered very quietly, just is if the\nCat had come back in a natural way.",
        "“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.",
        "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\nsaid to herself: “the March Hare will be much the most interesting,\nand perhaps, as this is May, it won’t be raving mad—at least not so\nmad as it was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there\nwas the Cat again sitting on a branch of a tree.",
        "“Did you say ’pig,’ or ’fig’?” said the Cat.",
        "“I said ’pig’,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy!”",
        "“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.",
        "“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\ngrin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in all my\nlife!”",
        "She had not gone much further before she came in sight of the house of\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\nnibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up toward it rather\ntimidly, saying to herself, “Suppose it should be raving mad after\nall! I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”",
        "",
        "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was\nsitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as\na cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.\n\"Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only as it’s\nasleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.”",
        "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\none corner of it. “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\nAlice coming.",
        "“There’s plenty of room!” said Alice indignantly, and she sat down\nin a large arm-chair at one end of the table.",
        "“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.",
        "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n\"I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.",
        "“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.",
        "“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice, angrily.",
        "“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\nthe March Hare.",
        "“I didn’t know it was your table,” said Alice: “it’s laid for a\ngreat many more than three.”",
        "“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\nspeech.",
        "“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\nseverity: “it’s very rude.”",
        "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he\nsaid was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”",
        "“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\nbegun asking riddles—I believe I can guess that,” she added, aloud.",
        "“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\nthe March Hare.",
        "“Exactly so,” said Alice.",
        "“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.",
        "“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\nsay—that’s the same thing, you know.”",
        "“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “Why, you might just as\nwell say that ’I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ’I eat what I\nsee’!”",
        "“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ’I like what\nI get’ is the same thing as ’I get what I like’!”",
        "“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, which seemed to be\ntalking in its sleep, “that ’I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\nas ’I sleep when I breathe’!”",
        "“It is the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\nwriting-desks, which wasn’t much.",
        "The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\nis it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\nand holding it to his ear.",
        "Alice considered a little, and then said, “The fourth.”",
        "“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\nthe works!” he added, looking angrily at the March Hare.",
        "“It was the best butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.",
        "“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\n\"you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”",
        "The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he\ndipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could\nthink of nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the\nbest butter, you know.”",
        "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\nfunny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and\ndoesn’t tell what o’clock it is!”",
        "“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does your watch tell you what\nyear it is?”",
        "“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\nstays the same year for such a long time together.”",
        "“Which is just the case with mine,” said the Hatter.",
        "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to her to\nhave no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I\ndon’t quite understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.",
        "“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a\nlittle hot tea upon its nose.",
        "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\neyes, “Of course, of course: just what I was going to remark myself.”",
        "“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\nagain.",
        "“No, I give it up,” Alice replied. “What’s the answer?”",
        "“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.",
        "“Nor I,” said the March Hare.",
        "Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\ntime,” she said, “than wasting it in asking riddles that have no\nanswers.”",
        "“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t\ntalk about wasting it. It’s him.”",
        "“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.",
        "“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”",
        "“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied; “but I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.”",
        "“Ah! That accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock\nin the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper\na hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past\none, time for dinner!”",
        "(\"I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)",
        "“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully; “but then—I\nshouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”",
        "“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.”",
        "“Is that the way you manage?” Alice asked.",
        "The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We\nquarrelled last March—just before he went mad, you know—\"\n(pointing with his teaspoon at the March Hare), “—it was at the great\nconcert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing:",
        "You know the song, perhaps?”",
        "“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.",
        "“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—",
        "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep,\n”Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle—” and went on so long that they\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.",
        "“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when\nthe Queen bawled out ’He’s murdering the time! Off with his head!’”",
        "“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.",
        "“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he\nwon’t do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”",
        "A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\ntea-things are put out here?” she asked.",
        "“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\nand we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”",
        "“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.",
        "“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”",
        "“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice\nventured to ask.",
        "“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n\"I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”",
        "“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\nproposal.",
        "“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried, “Wake up, Dormouse!” And\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.",
        "The Dormouse slowly opened its eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” it said in a\nhoarse, feeble voice, “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”",
        "“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.",
        "“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.",
        "“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\nbefore it’s done.”",
        "“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\nin a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\nthey lived at the bottom of a well—”",
        "“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\nin questions of eating and drinking.",
        "“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\ntwo.",
        "“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked.\n\"They’d have been ill.”",
        "“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “very ill.”",
        "Alice tried a little to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary\nway of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much: so she went\non:",
        "“But why did they live at the bottom of a well?”",
        "“Take some more tea”, the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.",
        "“I’ve had nothing yet”, Alice replied in an offended tone: “so I can’t\ntake more.”",
        "“You mean you can’t take less,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy\nto take more than nothing.”",
        "“Nobody asked your opinion,” said Alice.",
        "“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.",
        "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\nrepeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”",
        "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\nsaid, “It was a treacle-well.”",
        "“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\nHatter and the March Hare went, “Sh! Sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\nremarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\nyourself.”",
        "“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly, “I won’t interrupt you\nagain. I dare say there may be one.”",
        "“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\ngo on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\nyou know—”",
        "“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.",
        "“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all, this time.",
        "“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one\nplace on.”",
        "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\nmoved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from the change; and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.",
        "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\nfrom?”",
        "“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I\nshould think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh,\nstupid?”",
        "“But they were in the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not\nchoosing to notice this last remark.",
        "“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse: “well in.”",
        "This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on\nfor some time without interrupting it.",
        "“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and\nrubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all\nmanner of things—everything that begins with an M—”",
        "“Why with an M?” said Alice.",
        "“Why not?” said the March Hare.",
        "Alice was silent.",
        "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into\na doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\nlittle shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\nthings are ’much of a muchness’—did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?”",
        "“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\nthink—”",
        "“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.",
        "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off: the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe tea-pot.",
        "“At any rate I’ll never go there again!” said Alice, as she picked\nher way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at\nin all my life!”",
        "Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\nleading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But\neverything’s curious to-day. I think I may as well go in at once.” And\nin she went.",
        "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\nglass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\nled into the garden. Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and then—she found\nherself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower-beds\nand the cool fountains.",
        "A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and, just as she came up to them, she heard\none of them say, “Look out, now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\nlike that!”",
        "“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone. “Seven jogged my\nelbow.”",
        "On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\nblame on others!”",
        "“You’d better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded.”",
        "“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.",
        "“That’s none of your business, Two!” said Seven.",
        "“Yes, it is his business!” said Five. “And I’ll tell him—it was for\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”",
        "Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun, “Well, of all the\nunjust things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood\nwatching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked\nround also, and all of them bowed low.",
        "“Would you tell me, please,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you\nare painting those roses?”",
        "Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began, in a low\nvoice, “Why, the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been\na red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and, if the\nQueen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you\nknow. So you see, Miss, we’re doing out best, afore she comes, to—\"\nAt this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the\ngarden, called out, “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners\ninstantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of\nmany footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",
        "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs: these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers: these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these\ncame the royal children: there were ten of them, and the little dears\ncame jumping merrily along, hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS.",
        "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her\nface like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having\nheard of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the\nuse of a procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down on\ntheir faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood where she\nwas, and waited.",
        "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and\nlooked at her, and the Queen said, severely, “Who is this?”",
        "She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in\nreply.",
        "“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently: and, turning to\nAlice, she went on: “What’s your name, child?”",
        "“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards after\nall. I needn’t be afraid of them!”",
        "“And who are these?” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying\non their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the\nrest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or\nsoldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.",
        "“How should I know!” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\nno business of mine.”",
        "The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\nmoment like a wild beast, began screaming, “Off with her head! Off\nwith—”",
        "“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\nsilent.",
        "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said, “Consider, my\ndear: she is only a child!”",
        "The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave, “Turn\nthem over!”",
        "The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.",
        "“Get up!” said the Queen in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, Queen,\nthe royal children, and everybody else.",
        "“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on “What have you been doing\nhere?”",
        "“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”",
        "“I see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the\nroses. “Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of\nthe soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners,\nwho ran to Alice for protection.",
        "“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after\nthe others.",
        "“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.",
        "“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers\nshouted in reply.",
        "“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”",
        "The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\nevidently meant for her.",
        "“Yes!” shouted Alice.",
        "“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\nwondering very much what would happen next.",
        "“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.",
        "“Very,” said Alice. “Where’s the Duchess?”",
        "“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone. He looked\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered, “She’s under\nsentence of execution.”",
        "“What for?” said Alice.",
        "“Did you say, ’What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.",
        "“No, I didn’t,” said Alice. “I don’t think it’s at all a pity.\nI said ’What for?’”",
        "“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\nscream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\ntone. “The Queen will hear you! You see she came rather late, and the\nQueen said—”",
        "“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\nother: however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\nbegan.",
        "Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her\nlife: it was all ridges and furrows: the croquet balls were live\nhedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to\ndouble themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the\narches.",
        "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her\nflamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably\nenough under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just\nas she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give\nthe hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and\nlook up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not\nhelp bursting out laughing; and, when she had got its head down, and\nwas going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the\nhedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away:\nbesides all this, there was generally a ridge or a furrow in the way\nwherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up\nsoldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the\nground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult\ngame indeed.",
        "The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\ntime the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about and\nshouting, “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\nminute.",
        "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure she had not as yet had any\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n\"and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\nfond of beheading people here: the great wonder is that there’s any\none left alive!”",
        "",
        "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether\nshe could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but after\nwatching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin, and she said\nto herself, “It’s the Cheshire-Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.”",
        "“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\nenough for it to speak with.",
        "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\nspeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least\none of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then\nAlice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling\nvery glad she had some one to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think\nthat there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",
        "“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\none’s self speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular:\nat least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive: for instance, there’s the\narch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\nground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now,\nonly it ran away when it saw mine coming!”",
        "“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.",
        "“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on\n\"—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”",
        "The Queen smiled and passed on.",
        "“Who are you talking to?” said the King, coming up to Alice, and\nlooking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.",
        "“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire-Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\nintroduce it.”",
        "“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\nkiss my hand, if it likes.”",
        "“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.",
        "“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\nthat!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.",
        "“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\nbut I don’t remember where.”",
        "“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly; and he\ncalled to the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish\nyou would have this Cat removed!”",
        "The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\nsmall. “Off with his head!” she said without even looking round.",
        "“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\nhurried off.",
        "Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going\non, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never\nknew whether it was her turn or not. So she went off in search of her\nhedgehog.",
        "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which\nseemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them\nwith the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone\nacross to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it\ntrying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",
        "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\nmatter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this\nside of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it\nmight not escape again, and went back to have a little more\nconversation with her friend.",
        "When she got back to the Cheshire-Cat, she was surprised to find quite\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at\nonce, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very\nuncomfortable.",
        "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as\nthey all spoke at once, she found it very hard to make out exactly\nwhat they said.",
        "The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head\nunless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to\ndo such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of\nlife.",
        "The King’s argument was that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.",
        "The Queen’s argument was that, if something wasn’t done about it in\nless than no time, she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\nanxious.)",
        "Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the\nDuchess: you’d better ask her about it.”",
        "“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her\nhere.” And the executioner went off like an arrow.",
        "The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared:\nso the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down, looking for\nit, while the rest of the party went back to the game.",
        "",
        "“You can’t think how glad I am to see you, again, you dear old thing!\"\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,\nand they walked off together.",
        "Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.",
        "“When I’m a Duchess,” she said to herself (not in a very hopeful\ntone, though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup\ndoes very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a\nnew kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that\nmakes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make\nchildren sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they\nwouldn’t be so stingy about it, you know—”",
        "She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it\nin a bit.”",
        "“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.",
        "“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if\nonly you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s\nside as she spoke.",
        "Alice did not much like her keeping so close to her: first, because\nthe Duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\nright height to rest her chin on Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude: so she\nbore it as well as she could.",
        "“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping\nup the conversation a little.",
        "“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—’Oh, ’tis\nlove, ’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”",
        "“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\ntheir own business!”",
        "“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging\nher sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the\nmoral of that is—’Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take\ncare of themselves.’”",
        "“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\nherself.",
        "“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,\"\nthe Duchess said, after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful\nabout the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”",
        "“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\nto have the experiment tried.",
        "“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\nthe moral of that is—’Birds of a feather flock together.’”",
        "“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.",
        "“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\nputting things!”",
        "“It’s a mineral, I think,” said Alice.",
        "“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said: “there’s a large mustard mine near here.\nAnd the moral of that is—’The more there is of mine, the less there\nis of yours.’”",
        "“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\nremark, “It’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”",
        "“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\nis—’Be what you would seem to be’—or, if you’d like it put more\nsimply—’Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.’”",
        "“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\n\"if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”",
        "“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\nin a pleased tone.",
        "“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\nAlice.",
        "“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a\npresent of everything I’ve said as yet.”",
        "“A cheap sort of present,” thought Alice. “I’m glad people don’t give\nbirthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out\nloud.",
        "“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\nlittle chin.",
        "“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\nfeel a little worried.",
        "“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly;\nand the m—”",
        "But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\neven in the middle of her favorite word “moral,” and the arm that was\nlinked into hers began to tremble.",
        "Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her\narms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.",
        "“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.",
        "“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\nground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\nabout half no time! Take your choice!”",
        "The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.",
        "“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was\ntoo much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\ncroquet ground.",
        "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her they hurried\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\nwould cost them their lives.",
        "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\nwith the other players and shouting, “Off with his head!” or “Off with\nher head!”",
        "Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who\nof course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the\nend of half an hour or so, there were no arches left, and all the\nplayers, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and\nunder sentence of execution.",
        "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice:",
        "“Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?”",
        "“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”",
        "“It’s the thing Mock Turtle soup is made from,” said the Queen.",
        "“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.",
        "“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history.”",
        "As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\nto the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, that’s a\ngood thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at\nthe number of executions the Queen had ordered.",
        "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. “Up,\nlazy thing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\nexecutions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\nwith the Gryphon.",
        "Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole\nshe thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after\nthat savage Queen: so she waited.",
        "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled.",
        "“What fun!” said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.",
        "“What is the fun?” said Alice.",
        "“Why, she,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!”",
        "“Everybody says ’come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\nafter it: “I never was so ordered about before, in all my life,\nnever!”",
        "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.",
        "She pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon.\nAnd the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before,\n\"It’s all his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come\non!”",
        "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\nfull of tears, but said nothing.",
        "“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\nhistory, she do.”",
        "“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone. “Sit\ndown, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”",
        "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\nherself “I don’t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn’t begin.\"\nBut she waited patiently.",
        "“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\nTurtle.”",
        "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\noccasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the\nconstant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly\ngetting up and saying, “Thank you, Sir, for your interesting story,\"\nbut she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she\nsat still and said nothing.",
        "“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\nsea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”",
        "“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.",
        "“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\nangrily. “Really you are very dull!”",
        "“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\nquestion,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all\nday about it!” and he went on in these words:",
        "“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”",
        "“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.",
        "“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\nThe Mock Turtle went on:",
        "“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every\nday—”",
        "“I’ve been to a day-school, too,” said Alice. “You needn’t be\nso proud as all that.”",
        "“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle, a little anxiously.",
        "“Yes,” said Alice; “we learned French and music.”",
        "“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.",
        "“Ah! Then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in\na tone of great relief. “Now, at ours, they had, at the end of the\nbill, ’French, music, and washing—extra.’”",
        "“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\nof the sea.”",
        "“I couldn’t afford to learn it,” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I\nonly took the regular course.”",
        "“What was that?” inquired Alice.",
        "“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\nreplied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.”",
        "“I never heard of ’Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is\nit?”",
        "The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “Never heard of\nuglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”",
        "“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”",
        "“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\nis, you are a simpleton.”",
        "Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it: so\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said, “What else had you to learn?”",
        "“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\nsubjects on his flappers—\"Mystery, ancient and modern, with\nSeaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\nthat used to come once a week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching,\nand Fainting in Coils.”",
        "“What was that like?” said Alice.",
        "“Well, I can’t show it you, myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learned it.”",
        "“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classical master,\nthough. He was an old crab, he was.”",
        "“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh. “He taught\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.”",
        "“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and\nboth creatures hid their faces in their paws.",
        "“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\nto change the subject.",
        "“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and\nso on.”",
        "“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.",
        "“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\n\"because they lessen from day to day.”",
        "This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\nbefore she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been\na holiday?”",
        "“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.",
        "“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\ndecided tone. “Tell her something about the games now.”",
        "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice and tried to speak, but, for a minute or\ntwo, sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\"\nsaid the Gryphon; and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:",
        "“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (\"I haven’t,” said\nAlice)—\"and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—\"\n(Alice began to say, “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily,\nand said, “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful\nthing a Lobster-Quadrille is!”",
        "“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”",
        "“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\nsea-shore—”",
        "“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so\non: then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”",
        "“That generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.",
        "“—you advance twice—”",
        "“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.",
        "“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”",
        "“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.",
        "“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”",
        "“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.",
        "“—as far out to sea as you can—”",
        "“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.",
        "“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\nabout.",
        "“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.",
        "“Back to land again, and—that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\nsadly and quietly and looked at Alice.",
        "“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.",
        "“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“Very much indeed,” said Alice.",
        "“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.\n\"We can do it without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”",
        "“Oh, you sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”",
        "So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\nfore-paws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very\nslowly and sadly:",
        "“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\ncurious song about the whiting!”",
        "“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen\nthem, of course?”",
        "“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked\nherself hastily.",
        "“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle; “but, if\nyou’ve seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like?”",
        "“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in\ntheir mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”",
        "“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\nall wash off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths;\nand the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.",
        "“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.",
        "“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they would go with the\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\ncouldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”",
        "“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.”",
        "“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do\nyou know why it’s called a whiting?”",
        "“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”",
        "“It does the boots and shoes,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.",
        "Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\nin a wondering tone.",
        "“Why, what are your shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean,\nwhat makes them so shiny?”",
        "Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\nanswer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”",
        "“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n\"are done with whiting. Now you know.”",
        "“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.",
        "“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied, rather impatiently:\n\"any shrimp could have told you that.”",
        "“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\nrunning on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ’Keep back,\nplease! We don’t want you with us!’”",
        "“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said. “No\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”",
        "“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice, in a tone of great surprise.",
        "“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle. “Why, if a fish came to me\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say, ’With what\nporpoise?’”",
        "“Don’t you mean ’purpose’?” said Alice.",
        "“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied, in an offended tone.\nAnd the Gryphon added, “Come, let’s hear some of your adventures.”",
        "“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\nAlice a little timidly; “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\nbecause I was a different person then.”",
        "“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n\"explanations take such a dreadful time.”",
        "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she\nfirst saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it, just at\nfirst, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and\nopened their eyes and mouths so very wide; but she gained\ncourage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she\ngot to the part about her repeating, “You are old, Father William,\"\nto the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the\nMock Turtle drew a long breath, and said, “That’s very curious!”",
        "“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.",
        "“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\nbegin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\nauthority over Alice.",
        "“Stand up and repeat, ’Tis the voice of the sluggard,’” said\nthe Gryphon.",
        "“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\"\nthought Alice. “I might just as well be at school at once.” However,\nshe got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the\nLobster-Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying; and the\nwords came very queer indeed:",
        "“That’s different from what I used to say when I was a child,\"\nsaid the Gryphon.",
        "“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle, “but it\nsounds uncommon nonsense.”",
        "Alice said nothing: she had sat down with her face in her hands,\nwondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.",
        "“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.",
        "“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily, “Go on with the next\nverse.”",
        "“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How could he turn\nthem out with his nose, you know?”",
        "“It’s the first position in dancing,” Alice said; but she was\ndreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the\nsubject.",
        "“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated: “it begins, ’I\npassed by his garden!’”",
        "Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—",
        "“What is the use of repeating all that stuff?” the Mock Turtle\ninterrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the\nmost confusing thing I ever heard!”",
        "“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon, and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so.",
        "“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon\nwent on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you another song?”",
        "“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\n\"Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ’Turtle Soup,’ will you, old\nfellow?”",
        "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice choked with sobs,\nto sing this:—",
        "“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\nto repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the\ndistance.",
        "“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it\nhurried off without waiting for the end of the song.",
        "“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\nanswered, “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:",
        "",
        "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.",
        "In the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts\nupon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look\nat them—\"I wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand\nround the refreshments!” But there seemed to be no chance of this; so\nshe began looking at everything about her to pass away the time.",
        "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\nthe name of nearly everything there.",
        "“That’s the judge”, she said to herself, “because of his great wig.”",
        "The judge, by the way, was the King; and, as he wore his crown over\nthe wig, he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not\nbecoming.",
        "“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice; “and those twelve creatures\"\n(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them\nwere animals, and some were birds), “I suppose they are the jurors.\"\nShe said this last word two or three times over to herself, being\nrather proud of it; for she thought, and rightly too, that very few\nlittle girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However,\n\"jurymen” would have done just as well.",
        "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.",
        "“What are they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t\nhave anything to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”",
        "“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\n\"for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”",
        "“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud indignant voice; but she\nstopped herself hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in\nthe court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously\nround, to make out who was talking.",
        "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\nthat all the jurors were writing down “Stupid things!” on their\nslates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how\nto spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbor to tell him.",
        "“A nice muddle their slates’ll be in, before the trial’s over!\"\nthought Alice.",
        "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This, of course, Alice\ncould not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him,\nand very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so\nquickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not\nmake out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for\nit, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day;\nand this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate.",
        "“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.",
        "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\nunrolled the parchment-scroll, and read as follows:",
        "“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.",
        "“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great\ndeal to come before that!”",
        "“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\nthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out “First witness!”",
        "The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.",
        "“I beg pardon, your Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in; but I\nhadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.”",
        "“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”",
        "The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse, “Fourteenth of March, I think\nit was,” he said.",
        "“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.",
        "“Sixteenth,” said the Dormouse.",
        "“Write that down,” the King said to the jury; and the jury eagerly\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up,\nand reduced the answer to shillings and pence.",
        "“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.",
        "“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.",
        "“Stolen!” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly\nmade a memorandum of the fact.",
        "“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation. “I’ve none\nof my own. I’m a hatter.”",
        "Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring hard at the\nHatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.",
        "“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll\nhave you executed on the spot.”",
        "This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\nbread-and-butter.",
        "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\nas long as there was room for her.",
        "“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so,” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her. “I can hardly breathe.”",
        "“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”",
        "“You’ve no right to grow here,” said the Dormouse.",
        "“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re\ngrowing too.”",
        "“Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\nthat ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\nto the other side of the court.",
        "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said, to one of the\nofficers of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last\nconcert!” on which the wretched Hatter trembled so that he shook off\nboth his shoes.",
        "“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you\nexecuted, whether you’re nervous or not.”",
        "“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling\nvoice, “and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what\nwith the bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the\ntea—”",
        "“The twinkling of what?” said the King.",
        "“It began with the tea,” the Hatter replied.",
        "“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply.\n\"Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!”",
        "“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\nthat—only the March Hare said—”",
        "“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.",
        "“You did!” said the Hatter.",
        "“I deny it!” said the March Hare.",
        "“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”",
        "“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too; but the Dormouse\ndenied nothing, being fast asleep.",
        "“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread and\nbutter—”",
        "“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.",
        "“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.",
        "“You must remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”",
        "The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\ndown on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.",
        "“You’re a very poor speaker,” said the King.",
        "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which\ntied up at the mouth with strings; into this they slipped the\nguinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)",
        "“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice “I’ve so often read in\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, ’There was some attempt at\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\ncourt,’ and I never understood what it meant till now.”",
        "“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the\nKing.",
        "“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter; “I’m on the floor, as it is.”",
        "“Then you may sit down,” the King replied.",
        "Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.",
        "“Come, that finishes the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall go\non better.”",
        "“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.",
        "“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.",
        "“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\nofficers; but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\nto the door.",
        "“Call the next witness!” said the King.",
        "The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.",
        "“Give your evidence,” said the King.",
        "“Shan’t,” said the cook.",
        "The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said, in a low\nvoice, “Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.”",
        "“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said with a melancholy air, and,\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\nnearly out of sight, he said, in a deep voice, “What are tarts made\nof?”",
        "“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.",
        "“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.",
        "“Collar that Dormouse!” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!\nTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\nwhiskers!”",
        "For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the\nDormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the\ncook had disappeared.",
        "“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the\nnext witness.” And, he added, in an undertone to the Queen, “Really,\nmy dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my\nforehead ache!”",
        "Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they\nhaven’t got much evidence yet,” she said to herself. Imagine\nher surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\nlittle voice, the name “Alice!”",
        "“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and\nthere they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\ngold-fish she had accidentally upset the week before.",
        "“Oh, I beg your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay,\nand began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the\naccident of the gold-fish kept running in her head, and she had a\nvague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back\ninto the jury-box, or they would die.",
        "“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King, in a very grave voice,\n\"until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—all,” he\nrepeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.",
        "Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\nthe Lizard in head downward, and the poor little thing was waving its\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.",
        "She soon got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies\nmuch,” she said to herself; “I should think it would be quite as\nmuch use in the trial one way up as the other.”",
        "As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\ncourt.",
        "“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.",
        "“Nothing,” said Alice.",
        "“Nothing whatever?” persisted the King.",
        "“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.",
        "“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\nRabbit interrupted: “Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course,” he\nsaid, in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him\nas he spoke.",
        "“Unimportant, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\nto himself in an undertone, “important—unimportant—unimportant—important—\"\nas if he were trying which word sounded best.",
        "Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”",
        "Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their\nslates; “but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.",
        "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\nhis note-book, called out, “Silence!” and read out from his book,\n\"Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the\ncourt.”",
        "Everybody looked at Alice.",
        "“I’m not a mile high,” said Alice.",
        "“You are,” said the King.",
        "“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.",
        "“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a\nregular rule: you invented it just now.”",
        "“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.",
        "“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.",
        "The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.",
        "“Consider your verdict,” he said to the jury, in a low trembling\nvoice.",
        "“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry: “this paper has just been\npicked up.”",
        "“What’s in it?” said the Queen.",
        "“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit; “but it seems to be\na letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”",
        "“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\nnobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”",
        "“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.",
        "“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit: “in fact, there’s\nnothing written on the outside.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\nand added, “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”",
        "“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the\njurymen.",
        "“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\nthing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)",
        "“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury\nall brightened up again.)",
        "“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\ncan’t prove that I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”",
        "“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\nworse. You must have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\nyour name like an honest man.”",
        "There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\nclever thing the King had said that day.",
        "“That proves his guilt, of course,” said the Queen: “so, off with—”",
        "“It doesn’t prove anything of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t\neven know what they’re about!”",
        "“Read them,” said the King.",
        "The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please\nyour Majesty?” he asked.",
        "“Begin at the beginning,” the King said very gravely, “and go on till\nyou come to the end: then stop.”",
        "There was dead silence in the court, while the White Rabbit read out\nthese verses:",
        "“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said\nthe King, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”",
        "“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice (she had grown so\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\ninterrupting him), “I’ll give him sixpence. I don’t believe there’s\nan atom of meaning in it.”",
        "The jury all wrote down, on their slates, “She doesn’t believe\nthere’s an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to\nexplain the paper.",
        "“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t\nknow,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking\nat them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\n’—said I could not swim—’ you can’t swim, can you?” he added,\nturning to the Knave.",
        "The Knave shook his head sadly.",
        "“Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he certainly did not, being\nmade entirely of cardboard.)",
        "“All right, so far,” said the King; and he went on muttering over the\nverses to himself: “’We know it to be true’—that’s the jury,\nof course—’If she should push the matter on’—that must be the\nQueen—’What would become of you?’—What indeed!—’I gave\nher one, they gave him two’—why, that must be what he did with\nthe tarts, you know—”",
        "“But it goes on ’they all returned from him to you,’” said\nAlice.",
        "“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\ntarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than that. Then\nagain—’before she had this fit’—you never had fits, my dear,\nI think?” he said to the Queen.",
        "“Never!” said the Queen, furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\nas it lasted.)",
        "“Then the words don’t fit you,” said the King; looking round\nthe court with a smile. There was a dead silence.",
        "“It’s a pun!” the King added in an angry tone, and everybody laughed.\n\"Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for about the\ntwentieth time that day.",
        "“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterward.”",
        "“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the\nsentence first!”",
        "“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.",
        "“I won’t!” said Alice.",
        "“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\nmoved.",
        "“Who cares for you?” said Alice (she had grown to her full size by\nthis time). “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”",
        "At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\nher; she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.",
        "“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister. “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\nhad!”",
        "“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice. And she told her\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\nadventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and, when\nshe had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It was a curious\ndream, dear, certainly; but now run in to your tea: it’s getting late.”",
        "So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she\nmight, what a wonderful dream it had been.",
        "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\nand this was her dream:",
        "First, she dreamed about little Alice herself: once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\nlooking into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see\nthat queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\nthat would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\nstrange creatures of her little sister’s dream.",
        "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighboring pool—she\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the\npig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’ knee, while plates and dishes\ncrashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking\nof the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed\nguinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sob of the\nmiserable Mock Turtle.",
        "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep bells, and the Queen’s shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd-boy—and the sneeze of the baby,\nthe shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would\nchange (she knew) to the confused clamor of the busy farm-yard—while\nthe lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the\nMock Turtle’s heavy sobs.",
        "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood; and how she would gather about her other little children,\nand make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago; and how she\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy\nsummer days.",
