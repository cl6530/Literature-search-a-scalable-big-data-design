At Thebes or\non a desert island? Only remember me there! Shouldst Thou send\nme where man cannot live as Nature would have him, I will depart,\nnot in disobedience to Thee, but as though Thou wert sounding the\nsignal for my retreat: I am not deserting Theeâ€”far be that from\nme! I only perceive that thou needest me no longer.",
