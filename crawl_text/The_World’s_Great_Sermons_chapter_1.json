        "Thomas Hooker, graduate and fellow of Cambridge, England, and\npractically founder of Connecticut, was born in 1586. He was dedicated\nto the ministry, and began his activities in 1620 by taking a small\nparish in Surrey. He did not, however, attract much notice for his\npowerful advocacy of reformed doctrine, until 1629, when he was cited\nto appear before Laud, the Bishop of London, whose threats induced him\nto leave England for Holland, whence he sailed with John Cotton, in\n1633, for New England, and settled in Newtown, now Cambridge, Mass.",
        "Chiefly in consequence of disagreements between his own and Cotton’s\ncongregation he, with a large following, migrated in 1636 to the\nConnecticut Valley, where the little band made their center at\nHartford. Hooker was the inspirer if not the author of the Fundamental\nLaws and was of wide political as well as religious influence in\norganizing “The United Colonies of New England” in 1643–the first\neffort after federal government made on this continent. He was an\nactive preacher and prolific writer up to his death in 1647.",
