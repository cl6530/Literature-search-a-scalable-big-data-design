        "[126] As you discern the long unbroken line of its roof, low-pitched\nfor France, above the cottages and willow-shaded streams of the\nplace, you might think the abbey church of Pontigny, the largest\nCistercian church now remaining, only a great farm-building.  On a\nnearer view there is something unpretending, something pleasantly\nEnglish, in the plain grey walls, pierced with long “lancet” windows,\nas if they overlooked the lowlands of Essex, or the meadows of Kent\nor Berkshire, the sort of country from which came those saintly\nexiles of our race who made the cloisters of Pontigny famous, and one\nof whom, Saint Edmund of Abingdon, Saint-Edme, still lies enshrined\nhere.  The country which the sons of Saint Bernard choose for their\nabode is in fact but a patch of scanty pasture-land in the midst of a\nheady wine-district.  Like its majestic Cluniac rivals, the church\nhas its western portico, elegant in structure but of comparatively\nhumble [127] proportions, under a plain roof of tiles, pent-wise.\nWithin, a heavy coat of white-wash seems befitting to the simple\nforms of the “Transition,” or quite earliest “Pointed,\" style, to its\nremarkable continence of spirit, its uniformity, and cleanness of\nbuild.  The long prospect of nave and choir ends, however, with a\nsort of graceful smallness, in a chevet of seven closely packed,\nnarrow bays.  It is like a nun’s church, or like a nun’s coif.",
        "The church of Pontigny, representative generally of the churches of\nthe Cistercian order, including some of the loveliest early English\nones, was in truth significant of a reaction, a reaction against\nmonasticism itself, as it had come to be in the order of Cluny, the\ngenius of which found its proper expression in the imperious, but\nhalf-barbaric, splendours of the richest form of the Romanesque, the\nmonastic style pre-eminently, as we may still see it at La Charite-\nsur-Loire, at Saint-Benoit, above all, on the hill of Vezelay.  Saint\nBernard, who had lent his immense influence to the order of Citeaux\nby way of a monastic reform, though he had a genius for hymns and was\nin other ways an eminent religious poet, and though he gave new life\nto the expiring romance of the crusades, was, as regards the visible\nworld, much of a Puritan.  Was it he who, wrapt in thought upon the\nworld unseen, walked along the shores of Lake Leman without observing\nit?–the eternal snows he might have taken for the walls of the New\nJerusalem; the blue waves he [128] might have fancied its pavement of\nsapphire.  In the churches, the worship, of his new order he required\nsimplicity, and even severity, being fortunate in finding so winsome\nan exponent of that principle as the early Gothic of Pontigny, or of\nthe first Cistercian church, now destroyed, at Citeaux itself.\nStrangely enough, while Bernard’s own temper of mind was a survival\nfrom the past (we see this in his contest with Abelard), hierarchic,\nreactionary, suspicious of novelty, the architectural style of his\npreference was largely of secular origin.  It had a large share in\nthat inventive and innovating genius, that expansion of the natural\nhuman soul, to which the art, the literature, the religious movements\nof the thirteenth century in France, as in Italy, where it ends with\nDante, bear witness.",
        "In particular, Bernard had protested against the sculpture, rich and\nfantastic, but gloomy, it might be indecent, developed more\nabundantly than anywhere else in the churches of Burgundy, and\nespecially in those of the Cluniac order.  “What is the use,” he\nasks, “of those grotesque monsters in painting and sculpture?” and\nalmost certainly he had in mind the marvellous carved work at\nVezelay, whither doubtless he came often–for example on Good Friday,\n1146, to preach, as we know, the second crusade in the presence of\nLouis the Seventh.  He too might have wept at the sight of the doomed\nmultitude (one in ten, it is said, returned from the Holy [129]\nLand), as its enthusiasm, under the charm of his fiery eloquence,\nrose to the height of his purpose.  Even the aisles of Vezelay were\nnot sufficient for the multitude of his hearers, and he preached to\nthem in the open air, from a rock still pointed out on the hillside.\nArmies indeed have been encamped many times on the slopes and meadows\nof the valley of the Cure, now to all seeming so impregnably\ntranquil.  The Cluniac order even then had already declined from its\nfirst intention; and that decline became especially visible in the\nAbbey of Vezelay itself not long after Bernard’s day.  Its majestic\nimmoveable church was complete by the middle of the twelfth century.\nAnd there it still stands in spite of many a threat, while the\nconventual buildings around it have disappeared; and the institution\nit represented–secularised at its own request at the Reformation–\nhad dwindled almost to nothing at all, till in the last century the\nlast Abbot built himself, in place of the old Gothic lodging below\nthose solemn walls, a sort of Chateau Gaillard, a dainty abode in the\nmanner of Louis Quinze–swept away that too at the Revolution–where\nthe great oaks now flourish, with the rooks and squirrels.",
        "Yet the order of Cluny, in its time, in that dark period of the\neleventh and twelfth centuries, had deserved well of those to whom\nreligion, and art, and social order are precious.  The Cluniacs had\nin fact represented monasticism in the most [130] legitimate form of\nits activity; and, if the church of Vezelay was not quite the\ngrandest of their churches, it is certainly the grandest of them\nwhich remains.  It is also typical in character.  As Notre-Dame\nd’Amiens is pre-eminently the church of the city, of a commune, so\nthe Madeleine of Vezelay is typically the church of a monastery.",
        "The monastic style proper, then, in its peculiar power and influence,\nwas Romanesque, and with the Cluniac order; and here perhaps better\nthan anywhere else we may understand what it really came to, what was\nits effect on the spirits, the imagination.",
        "As at Pontigny, the Cistercians, for the most part, built their\nchurches in lowly valleys, according to the intention of their\nfounder.  The representative church of the Cluniacs, on the other\nhand, lies amid the closely piled houses of the little town, which it\nprotected and could punish, on a steep hill-top, like a long massive\nchest there, heavy above you, as you climb slowly the winding road,\nthe old unchanged pathway of Saint Bernard.  In days gone by it\nthreatened the surrounding neighbourhood with four boldly built\ntowers; had then also a spire at the crossing; and must have been at\nthat time like a more magnificent version of the buildings which\nstill crown the hill of Laon.  Externally, the proportions, the\nsquareness, of the nave (west and east, the vast narthex or porch,\nand the [131] Gothic choir, rise above its roof-line), remind one of\nanother great Romanesque church at home–of the nave of Winchester,\nout of which Wykeham carved his richly panelled Perpendicular\ninterior.",
        "At Vezelay however, the Romanesque, the Romanesque of Burgundy, alike\nin the first conception of the whole structure, and in the actual\nlocking together of its big stones, its masses of almost unbroken\nmasonry, its inertia, figures as of more imperial character, and\nnearer to the Romans of old, than its feebler kindred in England or\nNormandy.  We seem to have before us here a Romanesque architecture,\nstudied, not from Roman basilicas or Roman temples, but from the\narenas, the colossal gateways, the triumphal arches, of the people of\nempire, such as remain even now, not in the South of France only.\nThe simple “flying,” or rather leaning and almost couchant,\nbuttresses, quadrants of a circle, might be parts of a Roman\naqueduct.  In contrast to the lightsome Gothic manner of the last\nquarter of the twelfth century (as we shall presently find it here\ntoo, like an escape for the eye, for the temper, out of some grim\nunderworld into genial daylight), the Cluniac church might seem a\nstill active instrument of the iron tyranny of Rome, of its tyranny\nover the animal spirits.  As the ghost of ancient Rome still lingers\n“over the grave thereof,” in the papacy, the hierarchy, so is it with\nthe material structures [132] also, the Cluniac and other Romanesque\nchurches, which most emphatically express the hierarchical, the papal\nsystem.  There is something about this church of Vezelay, in the\nlong-sustained patience of which it tells, that brings to mind the\nlabour of slaves, whose occasional Fescennine licence and fresh\nmemories of a barbaric life also find expression, now and again, in\nthe strange sculpture of the place.  Yet here for once, around a\ngreat French church, there is the kindly repose of English\n“precincts,” and the country which this monastic acropolis overlooks\nsouthwards is a very pleasant one, as we emerge from the shadows of–\nyes! of that peculiarly sad place–a country all the pleasanter by\nreason of the toil upon it, performed, or exacted from others, by the\nmonks, through long centuries; Le Morvan, with its distant blue hills\nand broken foreground, the vineyards, the patches of woodland, the\nroads winding into their cool shadows; though in truth the fortress-\nlike outline of the monastic church and the sombre hue of its\nmaterial lend themselves most readily to the effects of a stormy sky.",
        "By a door, which in the great days opened from a magnificent\ncloister, you enter what might seem itself but the ambulatory of a\ncloister, superbly vaulted and long and regular, and built of huge\nstones of a metallic colour.  It is the southern aisle of the nave, a\nnave of ten bays, the grandest Romanesque interior in France, [133]\nperhaps in the world.  In its mortified light the very soul of\nmonasticism, Roman and half-military, as the completest outcome of a\nreligion of threats, seems to descend upon one.  Monasticism is\nindeed the product of many various tendencies of the religious soul,\none or another of which may very properly connect itself with the\nPointed style, as we saw in those lightsome aisles of Pontigny, so\nexpressive of the purity, the lowly sweetness, of the soul of\nBernard.  But it is here at Vezelay, in this iron place, that\nmonasticism in its central, its historically most significant\npurpose, presents itself as most completely at home.  There is no\ntriforium.  The monotonous cloistral length of wall above the long-\ndrawn series of stately round arches, is unbroken save by a plain\nsmall window in each bay, placed as high as possible just below the\ncornice, as a mere after-thought, you might fancy.  Those windows\nwere probably unglazed, and closed only with wooden shutters as\noccasion required.  Furnished with the stained glass of the period,\nthey would have left the place almost in darkness, giving doubtless\nfull effect to the monkish candle-light in any case needful here.  An\nalmost perfect cradle-roof, tunnel-like from end to end of the long\ncentral aisle, adds by its simplicity of form to the magnificent\nunity of effect.  The bearing-arches, which span it from bay to bay,\nbeing parti-coloured, with voussures of alternate white and a kind of\ngrey or green, [134] being also somewhat flat at the keystone, and\nliterally eccentric, have, at least for English eyes, something of a\nSaracenic or other Oriental character.  Again, it is as if the\narchitects–the engineers–who worked here, had seen things undreamt\nof by other Romanesque builders, the builders in England and\nNormandy.",
        "Here then, scarcely relieving the almost savage character of the\nwork, abundant on tympanum and doorway without, above all on the\nimmense capitals of the nave within, is the sculpture which offended\nBernard.  A sumptuous band of it, a carved guipure of singular\nboldness, passes continuously round the arches, and along the\ncornices from bay to bay, and with the large bossy tendency of the\nornament throughout may be regarded as typical of Burgundian\nrichness.  Of sculptured capitals, to like, or to dislike with Saint\nBernard, there are nearly a hundred, unwearied in variety, unique in\nthe energy of their conception, full of wild promise in their coarse\nexecution, cruel, you might say, in the realisation of human form and\nfeatures.  Irresistibly they rivet attention.",
        "The subjects are for the most part Scriptural, chosen apparently as\nbeing apt for strongly satiric treatment, the suicide of Judas, the\nfall of Goliath.  The legend of Saint Benedict, naturally at home in\na Benedictine church, presented the sculptor with a series of\nforcible grotesques ready-made.  Some monkish story, [135] half\nmoral, half facetious, perhaps a little coarse, like that of Sainte\nEugenie, from time to time makes variety; or an example of the\npunishment of the wicked by men or by devils, who play a large, and\nto themselves thoroughly enjoyable and merry, part here.  The\nsculptor would seem to have witnessed the punishment of the\nblasphemer; how adroitly the executioner planted knee on the\nculprit’s bosom, as he lay on the ground, and out came the sinful\ntongue, to meet the iron pincers.  The minds of those who worked thus\nseem to have been almost insanely preoccupied just then with the\nhuman countenance, but by no means exclusively in its pleasantness or\ndignity.  Bold, crude, original, their work indicates delight in the\npower of reproducing fact, curiosity in it, but little or no sense of\nbeauty.  The humanity therefore here presented, as in the Cluniac\nsculpture generally, is wholly unconventional.  M. Viollet-le-Duc\nthinks he can trace in it individual types still actually existing in\nthe peasantry of Le Morvan.  Man and morality, however, disappearing\nat intervals, the acanthine capitals have a kind of later Venetian\nbeauty about them, as the Venetian birds also, the conventional\npeacocks, or birds wholly of fantasy, amid the long fantastic\nfoliage.  There are still however no true flowers of the field here.\nThere is pity, it must be confessed, on the other hand, and the\ndelicacy, the beauty, which that always brings [136] with it, where\nJephtha peeps at the dead daughter’s face, lifting timidly the great\nleaves that cover it; in the hanging body of Absalom; in the child\ncarried away by the eagle, his long frock twisted in the wind as he\ngoes.  The parents run out in dismay, and the devil grins, not\nbecause it is the punishment of the child or of them; but because he\nis the author of all mischief everywhere, as the monkish carver\nconceived–so far wholesomely.",
        "We must remember that any sculpture less emphatic would have been\nineffective, because practically invisible, in this sombre place.\nBut at the west end there is an escape for the eye, for the soul,\ntowards the unhindered, natural, afternoon sun; not however into the\nouter and open air, but through an arcade of three bold round arches,\nhigh above the great closed western doors, into a somewhat broader\nand loftier place than this, a reservoir of light, a veritable camera\nlucida.  The light is that which lies below the vault and within the\ntribunes of the famous narthex (as they say), the vast fore-church or\nvestibule, into which the nave is prolonged.  A remarkable feature of\nmany Cluniac churches, the great western porch, on a scale which is\napproached in England only at Peterborough, is found also in some of\nthe churches of the Cistercians.  It is characteristic, in fact,\nrather of Burgundy than of either of those religious orders\nespecially.",
        "[137] At Pontigny itself, for instance, there is a good one; and a\nvery early one at Paray-le-Monial.  Saint-Pere-sous-Vezelay, daughter\nof the great church, in the vale below, has a late Gothic example;\nSemur also, with fantastic lodges above it.  The cathedral of Autun,\na secular church in rivalry of the “religious,” presents, by way of\nsuch western porch or vestibule, two entire bays of the nave,\nunglazed, with the vast western arch open to the air; the west front,\nwith its rich portals, being thrown back into the depths of the great\nfore-church thus produced.",
        "The narthex of Vezelay, the largest of these singular structures, is\nglazed, and closed towards the west by what is now the facade.  It is\nitself in fact a great church, a nave of three magnificent bays, and\nof three aisles, with a spacious triforium.  With their fantastic\nsculpture, sheltered thus from accident and weather, in all its\noriginal freshness, the great portals of the primitive facade serve\nnow for doorways, as a second, solemn, door of entrance, to the\nchurch proper within.  The very structure of the place, and its\nrelation to the main edifice, indicate that it was for use on\noccasion, when, at certain great feasts, that of the Magdalen\nespecially, to whom the church of Vezelay is dedicated, the monastery\nwas swollen with pilgrims, too poor, too numerous, to be lodged in\nthe town, come hither to worship before the [138] relics of the\nfriend of Jesus, enshrined in a low-vaulted crypt, the floor of which\nis the natural rocky surface of the hill-top.  It may be that the\npilgrims were permitted to lie for the night, not only on the\npavement, but (if so favoured) in the high and dry chamber formed by\nthe spacious triforium over the north aisle, awaiting an early Mass.\nThe primitive west front, then, had become but a wall of partition;\nand above its central portal, where the round arched west windows had\nbeen, ran now a kind of broad, arcaded tribune, in full view of the\nentire length of the church.  In the midst of it stood an altar; and\nhere perhaps, the priest who officiated being visible to the whole\nassembled multitude east and west, the early Mass was said.",
        "The great vestibule was finished about forty years after the\ncompletion of the nave, towards the middle of the twelfth century.\nAnd here, in the great pier-arches, and in the eastern bay of the\nvault, still with the large masonry, the large, flat, unmoulded\nsurfaces, and amid the fantastic carvings of the Romanesque building\nabout it, the Pointed style, determined yet discreet, makes itself\nfelt–makes itself felt by appearing, if not for the first time, yet\nfor the first time in the organic or systematic development of French\narchitecture.  Not in the unambitious facade of Saint-Denis, nor in\nthe austere aisles of Sens, but at Vezelay, in this grandiose fabric,\nso worthy of the event, Viollet-le-Duc would [139] fain see the\nbirthplace of the Pointed style.  Here at last, with no sense of\ncontrast, but by way of veritable “transition,” and as if by its own\nmatured strength, the round arch breaks into the double curve, les\narcs brises, with a wonderful access of grace.  And the imaginative\neffect is forthwith enlarged.  Beyond, far beyond, what is actually\npresented to the eye in that peculiar curvature, its mysterious\ngrace, and by the stateliness, the elevation of the ogival method of\nvaulting, the imagination is stirred to present one with what belongs\nproperly to it alone.  The masonry, though large, is nicely fitted; a\nlarge light is admitted through the now fully pronounced Gothic\nwindows towards the west.  At Amiens we found the Gothic spirit,\nreigning there exclusively, to be a restless one.  At Vezelay, where\nit breathes for the first time amid the heavy masses of the old\nimperial style, it breathes the very genius of monastic repose.  And\nthen, whereas at Amiens, and still more at Beauvais, at Saint-\nQuentin, you wonder how these monuments of the past can have endured\nso long, in strictly monastic Vezelay you have a sense of freshness,\nsuch as, in spite of their ruin, we perceive in the buildings of\nGreece.  We enjoy here not so much, as at Amiens, the sentiment of\nantiquity, but that of eternal duration.",
        "But let me place you once more where we stood for a while, on\nentering by the doorway [140] in the midst of the long southern\naisle.  Cross the aisle, and gather now in one view the perspective\nof the whole.  Away on the left hand the eye is drawn upward to the\ntranquil light of the vaults of the fore-church, seeming doubtless\nthe more spacious because partly concealed from us by the wall of\npartition below.  But on the right hand, towards the east, as if with\nthe set purpose of a striking architectural contrast, an instruction\nas to the place of this or that manner in the architectural series,\nthe long, tunnel-like, military work of the Romanesque nave opens\nwide into the exhilarating daylight of choir and transepts, in the\nsort of Gothic Bernard would have welcomed, with a vault rising now\nhigh above the roof-line of the body of the church, sicut lilium\nexcelsum.  The simple flowers, the flora, of the early Pointed style,\nwhich could never have looked at home as an element in the half-\nsavage decoration of the nave, seem to be growing here upon the\nsheaves of slender, reedy pillars, as if naturally in the carved\nstone.  Even here indeed, Roman, or Romanesque, taste still lingers\nproudly in the monolith columns of the chevet.  Externally, we may\nnote with what dexterity the Gothic choir has been inserted into its\nplace, below and within the great buttresses of the earlier\nRomanesque one.",
        "Visitors to the great church of Assisi have sometimes found a kind of\nparable in the threefold [141] ascent from the dark crypt where the\nbody of Saint Francis lies, through the gloomy “lower” church, into\nthe height and breadth, the physical and symbolic “illumination,” of\nthe church above.  At Vezelay that kind of contrast suggests itself\nin one view; the hopeful, but transitory, glory upon which one\nenters; the long, darksome, central avenue; the “open vision” into\nwhich it conducts us.  As a symbol of resurrection, its choir is a\nfitting diadem to the church of the Magdalen, whose remains the monks\nmeant it to cover.",
        "And yet, after all, notwithstanding this assertion of the superiority\n(are we so to call it?) of the new Gothic way, perhaps by the very\nforce of contrast, the Madeleine of Vezelay is still pre-eminently a\nRomanesque, and thereby the typically monastic, church.  In spite of\nrestoration even, as we linger here, the impression of the monastic\nMiddle Age, of a very exclusive monasticism, that has verily turned\nits back upon common life, jealously closed inward upon itself, is a\nsingularly weighty one; the more so because, as the peasant said when\nasked the way to an old sanctuary that had fallen to the occupation\nof farm-labourers, and was now deserted even by them: Maintenant il\nn’y a personne la.",
