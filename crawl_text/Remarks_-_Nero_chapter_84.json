        "Nero, who was a Roman Emperor from 54 to 68 A.D., was said to have been\none of the most disagreeable monarchs to meet that Rome ever had. He was a\nnephew of Culigula, the Emperor, on his mother’s side, and a son of\nDominitius Ahenobarbust, of St. Lawrence county. The above was really\nNero’s name, but in the year 50, A.D., his mother married Claudius and\nher son adopted the name of Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus. This\nname he was in the habit of wearing during the cold weather, buttoned up\nin front. During the hot weather, Nero was all the name he wore. In 53,\nNero married Octavia, daughter of Claudius, and went right to\nhousekeeping. Nero and Octavia did not get along first-rate. Nero soon\nwearied of his young wife and finally transferred her to the New\nJerusalem.",
        "In 54, Nero’s mother, by concealing the rightful heir to the throne for\nseveral weeks and doctoring the returns, succeeded in getting the steady\njob of Emperor for Nero at a good salary.",
        "His reign was quite stormy and several long, bloody wars were carried on\nduring that period. He was a good vicarious fighter and could successfully\nhold a man’s coat all day, while the man went to the front to get killed.\nHe loved to go out riding over the battle fields, as soon as it was safe,\nin his gorgeously bedizened band chariot and he didn’t care if the wheels\nrolled in gore up to the hub, providing it was some other man’s gore. It\ngave him great pleasure to drive about over the field of carnage and gloat\nover the dead. Nero was not a great success as an Emperor, but as a\ngloater he has no rival in history.",
        "Nero’s reign was characterized, also, by the great conflagration and Roman\nfireworks of July, 64, by which two-thirds of the city of Rome was\ndestroyed. The emperor was charged with starting this fire in order to get\nthe insurance on a stock of dry goods on Main street.",
        "Instead of taking off his crown, hanging it up in the hall and helping to\nput out the fire, as other Emperors have done time and again, Nero took\nhis violin up stairs and played, “I’ll Meet You When the Sun Goes Down.\"\nThis occasioned a great deal of adverse criticism on the part of those who\nopposed the administration. Several persons openly criticised Nero’s\npolicy and then died.",
        "A man in those days, would put on his overcoat in the morning and tell his\nwife not to keep dinner waiting. “I am going down town to criticise the\nEmperor a few moments,” he would say. “If I do not get home in time for\ndinner, meet me on the ’evergreen shore.’”",
        "Nero, after the death of Octavia, married Poppaea Sabina. She died\nafterward at her husband’s earnest solicitation. Nero did not care so much\nabout being a bridegroom, but the excitement of being a widower always\ngratified and pleased him.",
        "He was a very zealous monarch and kept Rome pretty well stirred up during\nhis reign. If a man failed to show up anywhere on time, his friends would\nlook sadly at each other and say, “Alas, he has criticised Nero.”",
        "A man could wrestle with the yellow fever, or the small-pox, or the\nAsiatic cholera and stand a chance for recovery, but when he spoke\nsarcastically of Nero, it was good-bye John.",
        "When Nero decided that a man was an offensive partisan, that man would\ngenerally put up the following notice on his office door:",
        "“Gone to see the Emperor in relation to charge of offensive partisanship.\nMeet me at the cemetery at 2 o’clock.”",
        "Finally, Nero overdid this thing and ran it into the ground. He did not\nwant to be disliked and so, those who disliked him were killed. This made\npeople timid and muzzled the press a good deal.",
        "The Roman papers in those days were all on one side. They did not dare to\nbe fearless and outspoken, for fear that Nero would take out his ad. So\nthey would confine themselves to the statement that: “The genial and\nurbane Afranius Burrhus had painted his new and recherche picket fence\nlast week,” or “Our enterprising fellow townsman, Caesar Kersikes, will\nremove the tail of his favorite bulldog next week, if the weather should\nbe auspicious,” or “Miss Agrippina Bangoline, eldest daughter of Romulus\nBangoline, the great Roman rinkist, will teach the school at Eupatorium,\nTrifoliatum Holler, this summer. She is a highly accomplished young lady,\nand a good speller.”",
        "Nero got more and more fatal as he grew older, and finally the Romans\nbegan to wonder whether he would not wipe out the Empire before he died.\nHis back yard was full all the time of people who had dropped in to be\nkilled, so that they could have it off their minds.",
        "Finally, Nero himself yielded to the great strain that had been placed\nupon him and, in the midst of an insurrection in Gaul, Spain and Rome\nitself, he fled and killed himself.",
        "The Romans were very grateful for Nero’s great crowning act in the killing\nline, but they were dissatisfied because he delayed it so long, and\ntherefore they refused to erect a tall monument over his remains. While\nthey admired the royal suicide and regarded it as a success, they censured\nNero’s negligence and poor judgment in suiciding at the wrong end of his\nreign.",
        "I have often wondered what Nero would have done if he had been Emperor of\nthe United States for a few weeks and felt as sensitive to newspaper\ncriticism as he seems to have been. Wouldn’t it be a picnic to see Nero\ncross the Jersey ferry to kill off a few journalists who had adversely\ncriticised his course? The great violin virtuoso and light weight Roman\ntyrant would probably go home by return mail, wrapped in tinfoil,\naccompanied by a note of regret from each journalist in New York, closing\nwith the remark, that “in the midst of life we are in death, therefore now\nis the time to subscribe.”",
