        "Whenever men spontaneously risk their lives and fortunes in the support of\na particular cause, they are wont to set a high value on their services,\nand generally assume the right of expressing their opinions, and of\ninterfering with their advice. Hence it happened that the dissensions and\nanimosities in the court and army of the unfortunate monarch were scarcely\nless violent or less dangerous than those which divided the parliamentary\nleaders. All thought themselves entitled to offices and honours from the\ngratitude of the sovereign; no appointment could be made which did not\ndeceive the expectations, and excite the murmurs, of numerous competitors;\nand complaints were everywhere heard, cabals were formed, and the wisest\nplans were frequently controlled and defeated, by men who thought\nthemselves neglected or aggrieved. When Charles, as one obvious remedy,\nremoved the lord Wilmot from the command of the cavalry, and the lord Percy\nfrom that of the ordnance, he found that he had only aggravated the\nevil; and the dissatisfaction of the army was further increased by the\nsubstitution of his nephew Prince Rupert, whose severe and imperious temper\nhad earned him the general hatred, in the place of Ruthen, who, on account\nof his infirmities, had been advised to retire.[1]",
        "Another source of most acrimonious controversy was furnished by the\nimportant question of peace or war, which formed a daily subject of debate\nin every company, and divided the royalists into contending parties. Some\nthere were (few, indeed, in number, and chiefly those whom the two houses\nby their votes had excluded from all hopes of pardon) who contended that\nthe king ought never to lay down his arms till victory should enable him to\ngive the law to his enemies; but the rest, wearied out with the fatigues\nand dangers of war, and alarmed by the present sequestration of their\nestates, and the ruin which menaced their families, most anxiously longed\nfor the restoration of peace. These, however, split into two parties; one\nwhich left the conditions to the wisdom of the monarch; the other which not\nonly advised, but occasionally talked of compelling a reconciliation, on\nalmost any terms, pretending that, if once the king were reseated on his\nthrone, he must quickly recover every prerogative which he might have lost.\nAs for Charles himself, he had already suffered too much by the war, and\nsaw too gloomy a prospect before him, to be indifferent to the subject;\nbut, though he was now prepared to make sacrifices, from which but two\nyears before he would have recoiled with horror, he had still resolved\nnever to subscribe to conditions irreconcilable with his honour and\nconscience; and in this temper of",

        "mind he was confirmed by the frequent letters of Henrietta from Paris, who\nreminded him of the infamy which he would entail on himself, were he, as\nhe was daily advised, to betray to the vengeance of the parliament the\nProtestant bishops and Catholic royalists, who, trusting to his word,\nhad ventured their all for his interest.[1] He had now assembled hisparliament for the second time; but the attendance of the members was\nscarce, and the inconvenience greater than the benefit. Motions were made\nungrateful to the feelings, and opposed to the real views of the king, who,\nto free himself from the more obtrusive and importunate of these advisers,\nsent them",
        "[Footnote 1: This is the inference which I have drawn from a careful\nperusal of the correspondence between Charles and the queen in his Works,\np. 142-150. Some writers have come to a different conclusion: that he\nwas insincere, and under the pretence of seeking peace, was in reality\ndetermined to continue the war. That he prepared for the resumption of\nhostilities is indeed true, but the reason which he gives to the queen is\nsatisfactory, “the improbability that this present treaty should produce\na peace, considering the great strange difference (if not contrariety) of\ngrounds that are betwixt the rebels’ propositions and mine, and that I\ncannot alter mine, nor will they ever theirs, until they be out of the hope\nto prevail by force” (p. 146). Nor do I see any proof that Charles was\ngoverned, as is pretended, by the queen. He certainly took his resolutions\nwithout consulting her, and, if she sometimes expressed her opinion\nrespecting them, it was no more than any other woman in a similar situation\nwould have done. “I have nothing to say, but that you have a care of your\nhonour; and that, if you have a peace, it may be such as may hold; and if\nit fall out otherwise, that you do not abandon those who have served you,\nfor fear they do forsake you in your need. Also I do not see how you can\nbe in safety without a regiment of guard; for myself, I think I cannot be,\nseeing the malice which they have against me and my religion, of which I\nhope you will have a care of both. But in my opinion, religion should\nbe the last thing upon which you should treat; for if you do agree upon\nstrictness against the Catholics, it would discourage them to serve you;\nand if afterwards there should be no peace, you could never expect succours\neither from Ireland, or any other Catholic prince, for they would believe\nyou would abandon them after you have served yourself” (p. 142, 143).]",

        "In the last summer the first use which he had made of each successive\nadvantage, was to renew[b] the offer of opening a negotiation for peace. It\nconvinced the army of the pacific disposition of their sovereign, and it\nthrew on the parliament, even among their own adherents, the blame of\ncontinuing the war. At length,[c] after the third message, the houses gave\na tardy and reluctant consent; but it was not before they had received from\nScotland the propositions formerly voted as the only basis of a lasting\nreconciliation, had approved of the amendments suggested by their allies,\nand had filled up the blanks with the specification of the acts of\nparliament to be passed, and with the names of the royalists to be excepted\nfrom the amnesty. It was plain to every intelligent man in either army that\nto lay such a foundation of peace was in reality to proclaim perpetual\nhostilities.[2] But the king, by the advice of his council, consented to\nmake it the subject of a treaty, for two ends; to discover whether it was\nthe resolution of the houses to adhere without any modification to these\nhigh pretensions; and to make the experiment, whether it were not possible\nto gain one of the two factions, the Presbyterians or the Independents, or\nat least to widen",

        "At Uxbridge, within the parliamentary quarters, the commissioners from the\ntwo parties met each other.[a] Those from the parliament had been commanded\nto admit of no deviation from the substance of the propositions already\nvoted; to confine themselves to the task of showing that their demands were\nconformable to reason, and therefore not to be refused; and to insist\nthat the questions of religion, the militia, and Ireland, should each\nbe successively debated during the term of three days, and continued in\nrotation till twenty days had expired, when, if no agreement were made, the\ntreaty should terminate. They demanded that episcopacy should be abolished,\nand the Directory be substituted in place of the Book of Common Prayer;\nthat the command of the army and navy should be vested in the two houses,\nand intrusted by them to certain commissioners of their own appointment;\nand that the cessation in Ireland should be broken, and hostilities\nshould be immediately renewed. The king’s commissioners replied, that\nhis conscience would not allow him to consent to the proposed change of\nreligious worship, but that he was willing to consent to a law restricting\nthe jurisdiction of the bishops within the narrowest bounds, granting every\nreasonable indulgence to tender consciences, and raising on the church\nproperty the sum of one hundred thousand",

Much of the time was spent in\ndebates respecting the comparative merits of the episcopal and presbyterian\nforms of church government, and in charges and recriminations as to the\nreal authors of the distress and necessity which had led to the cessation\nin Ireland. On the twentieth day nothing had been concluded. A proposal\nto prolong the negotiation was rejected by the two houses, and the\ncommissioners returned to London and Oxford.[a] The royalists had, however,\ndiscovered that Vane, St. John, and Prideaux had come to Uxbridge not\nso much to treat, as to act the part of spies on the conduct of their\ncolleagues; and that there existed an irreconcilable difference of opinion\nbetween the two parties, the Presbyterians seeking the restoration\nof royalty, provided it could be accomplished with perfect safety to\nthemselves, and with the legal establishment of their religious worship,\nwhile the Independents sought nothing less than the total downfall of the\nthrone, and the extinction of the privileges of the nobility.[1]",

        "derived but little of that benefit which he expected from the cessation in\nIreland. He dared not withdraw the bulk of his army before he had concluded\na peace with the insurgents; and they, aware of his difficulties, combined\ntheir demands, which he knew not how to grant, with an offer of aid which\nhe was unwilling to refuse. They demanded freedom of religion, the repeal\nof Poyning’s law, a parliamentary settlement of their estates, and a\ngeneral amnesty, with this exception, that an inquiry should be instituted\ninto all acts of violence and bloodshed not consistent with the\nacknowledged usages of war, and that the perpetrators should be punished\naccording to their deserts, without distinction of party or religion. It\nwas the first article which presented the chief difficulty. The Irish urged\nthe precedent of Scotland; they asked no more than had been conceded to the\nCovenanters; they had certainly as just a claim to the free exercise of\nthat worship, which had been the national worship for ages, as the Scots\ncould have, to the exclusive establishment of a form of religion which had\nnot existed during an entire century. But Charles, in addition to his own\nscruples, feared to irritate the prejudices of his Protestant subjects. He\nknew that many of his own adherents would deem such a concession an act of\napostasy; and he conjured the Irish deputies not to solicit that which must\nprove prejudicial to him, and therefore to themselves: let them previously\nenable him to master their common enemies; let them place him in a\ncondition “to make them happy,” and he assured them on the word of a king,\nthat he would not “disappoint their just expectations.\"[1] They were not,\nhowever, to be satisfied",

That\nnobleman was at first left to his own discretion. He was then authorized\nto promise the non-execution of the penal laws for the present, and their\nrepeal on the restoration of tranquillity; and, lastly, to stipulate for\ntheir immediate repeal, if he could not otherwise subdue the obstinacy, or\nremove the jealousy of the insurgents. The treaty at Uxbridge had disclosed\nto the eyes of the monarch the abyss which yawned before him; he saw “that\nthe aim of his adversaries was a total subversion of religion and regal\npower;” and he commanded Ormond to conclude the peace whatever it might\ncost, provided it should secure the persons and properties of the Irish\nProtestants, and the full exercise of the royal authority in the island.[1]",

App. xii. xiv. xv. xviii. iii. cccxxxi.\nHe thus states his reasons to the lord lieutenant:–\"It being now manifest\nthat the English rebels have, as far as in them lies, given the command\nof Ireland to the Scots” (they had made Leslie, earl of Leven,\ncommander-in-chief of all the English as well as Scottish forces in\nIreland), “that their aim is the total subversion of religion and regal\npower, and that nothing less will content them, or purchase peace here; I\nthink myself bound in conscience not to let slip the means of settling that\nkingdom (if it may be) fully under my obedience, nor lose that assistance\nwhich I may hope from my Irish subjects, for such scruples as in a less\npressing condition might reasonably be stuck at by me.... If the suspension\nof Poining’s act for such bills as shall be agreed upon between you there,\nand the present taking away of the penal laws against papists by a law,\nwill do it, I shall not think it a hard bargain, so that freely and\nvigorously they engage themselves in my assistance against my rebels of\nEngland and Scotland, for which no conditions can be too hard, not being\nagainst conscience or honour.\"–Charles’s Works, 149, 150.]",
        "In Scotland an unexpected but transient diversion had been made in favour\nof the royal cause. The earls, afterwards marquesses, of Antrim and\nMontrose had met in the court at Oxford. In abilities Montrose was inferior\nto few, in ambition to none. The reader is aware that he had originally\nfought in the ranks of the Covenanters, but afterwards transferred his\nservices to Charles, and narrowly escaped the vengeance of his enemies.\nNow, that he was again at liberty, he aspired to the glory of restoring\nthe ascendancy of the royal cause in Scotland. At first all his plans were\ndefeated by the jealousy or wisdom of Hamilton; but Hamilton gradually\nsunk, whilst his rival rose in the esteem of the sovereign.[1] Antrim, his\nassociate, was weak and capricious, but proud of his imaginary consequence,\nand eager to engage in undertakings to which neither his means nor his\ntalents were equal. He had failed in his original attempt to surprise the\ncastle of Dublin; and had twice fallen into the hands of the Scots in\nUlster, and twice made his escape; still his loyalty or presumption\nwas unsubdued, and he had come to Oxford to make a third tender of his\nservices.",
        "[Footnote 1: When Hamilton arrived at Oxford, Dec. 16, 1643, several\ncharges were brought against him by the Scottish royalists, which with his\nanswers may be seen in Burnet, Memoirs, 250-269. Charles pronounced no\nopinion; but his suspicions were greatly excited by the deception practised\nby Hamilton on the lords of the royal party at the convention, and his\nconcealment from them of the king’s real intentions. On this account\nHamilton was arrested, and conveyed to Pendennis Castle, in Cornwall,\nwhere he remained a prisoner till the place was taken by the parliamentary\nforces. Hamilton’s brother Lanark was also forbidden to appear at court;\nand, having received advice that he would be sent to the castle of Ludlow,\nmade his escape from Oxford to his countrymen in London, and thence\nreturned to Edinburgh. His offence was, that he, as secretary, had affixed\nthe royal signet to the proclamation of August 24, calling on all Scotsmen\nto arm in support of the new league and covenant.–See p. 36.]",
        "Both Antrim and Montrose professed themselves the personal enemies of\nthe earl of Argyle, appointed by the Scottish estates lieutenant of the\nkingdom; and they speedily arranged a plan, which possessed the double\nmerit of combining the interest of the king with the gratification of\nprivate revenge. Having obtained the royal commission,[1] Antrim proceeded\nto Ulster, raised eleven or fifteen hundred men among his dependants, and\ndespatched them to the opposite coast of Scotland under the command of his\nkinsman Alaster Macdonald, surnamed Colkitto.[2] They landed at Knoydart:\nthe destruction of their ships in Loch Eishord, by a hostile fleet,\ndeprived them of the means of returning to Ireland; and Argyle with a\nsuperior force cautiously watched their motions.[a] From the Scottish\nroyalists they received no aid; yet Macdonald marched as far as Badenoch,\ninflicting severe injuries on the Covenanters, but exposed to destruction\nfrom the increasing multitude of his foes. In the mean time, Montrose,\nwith the rank of lieutenant-general, had unfurled the royal standard at\nDumfries;[b] but with so little success, that he hastily retraced his steps\nto Carlisle, where by several daring actions he rendered such services to\nthe royal cause, that he received the title of marquess from the gratitude\nof the king.

There he received intelligence of the proceedings of Macdonald,\nand appointed to join him in Athole.[a] At the castle of Blair, which had\nsurrendered to the strangers, the two chieftains met: Montrose assumed the\ncommand, published the royal commission, and called on the neighbouring\nclans to join the standard of their sovereign. The Scots, who had scorned\nto serve under a foreigner, cheerfully obeyed, and to the astonishment of\nthe Covenanters an army appeared to rise out of the earth in a quarter the\nmost remote from danger; but it was an army better adapted to the purpose\nof predatory invasion than of permanent warfare. Occasionally it swelled to\nthe amount of several thousands: as often it dwindled to the original band\nof Irishmen under Macdonald.

But the royal leader\npenetrated through this Alpine wilderness,[b] compelled Argyle to save\nhimself in an open boat on Loch Tyne, and during six weeks wreaked his\nrevenge on the domains and the clansmen of the fugitive. At the approach of\nArgyle with eleven hundred regular troops, he retired; but suddenly turning\nto the left, crossed the mountains, and issuing from Glennevis, surprised\nhis pursuers at Inverlochy in Lochabar.[c] From his galley in the Frith\nArgyle beheld the assault of the enemy, the shock of the combatants, and\nthe slaughter of at least one half of his whole force.[d] This victory\nplaced the north of Scotland at the mercy of the conquerors.",

They objected that it\nwould be an act of hostility towards the parliament, a breach of the solemn\nleague and covenant between the nations: nor would they even allow him\nto inform Charles of their refusal, till they should have a personal\nconference with their commissioners in London. In these circumstances he\nburnt the order for the surrender of Newark; and the king, alarmed at his\nunaccountable silence, made no attempt to escape from Oxford. A fortnight\nwas passed in painful suspense.

If the delivery of the royal person, connected as it was with\nthe receipt of £200,000, bore the appearance of a sale, it ought to be\nremembered, that the accounts between the two nations had been adjusted in\nthe beginning of September; that for four months afterwards the Scots never\nceased to negotiate in favour of Charles; nor did they resign the care of\nhis person, till the votes of the English parliament compelled them to make\nthe choice between compliance or war. It may be, that in forming their\ndecision their personal interest was not forgotten; but there was another\nconsideration which had no small weight even with the friends of the\nmonarch. It was urged that by suffering the king to reside at Holmby, they\nwould do away with the last pretext for keeping on foot the army under\nthe command of Fairfax; the dissolution of that army would annihilate the\ninfluence of the Independents, and give an undisputed ascendancy to the\nPresbyterians; the first the declared enemies, the others the avowed\nadvocates of Scotland, of the kirk, and of the king; and the necessary\nconsequence must be, that the two parliaments would be left at liberty\nto arrange, in conformity with the covenant, both the establishment of\nreligion and the restoration of the throne.[1]",
        "Charles was not yet weaned from the expectation of succour from Ireland.\nAt Newcastle he had consoled the hours of his captivity with dreams of the\nmighty efforts for his deliverance, which would be made by Ormond, and\nGlamorgan, and the council at Kilkenny. To the first of these he forwarded\ntwo messages, one openly through Lanark, the Scottish secretary, the other\nclandestinely through Lord Digby, who proceeded to Dublin from France. By\nthe first Ormond received a positive command to break off the treaty\nwith the Catholics; by the second he was told to adhere to his former\ninstructions, and to obey no order which was not transmitted to him by the\nqueen or the prince.[a] The letter to Glamorgan proves more clearly the\ndistress to which he was reduced, and the confidence which he reposed in\nthe exertions of that nobleman. “If,” he writes, “you can raise a large sum\nof money by pawning my kingdoms for that purpose, I am content you should\ndo it; and if I recover them, I will fully repay that money. And tell the\nnuncio, that if once I can come into his and your hands, which ought to be\nextremely wish’d”",

The peace was reciprocally signed; it was published with more than\nusual parade in the cities of Dublin and Kilkenny; but at the same time a\nnational synod at Waterford not only condemned it[b] as contrary to the\noath of association, but on that ground excommunicated its authors,\nfautors, and abettors as guilty of perjury.

Under their direction, the two armies marched to besiege\nDublin: it was saved by the prudence of Ormond, who had wasted the\nneighbouring country, and by the habits of jealousy and dissension which\nprevented any cordial co-operation between O’Neil and Preston, the one\nof Irish, the other of English descent. Ormond, however, despaired of\npreserving the capital against their repeated attempts; and the important\nquestion for his decision was, whether he should surrender it to them or to\nthe parliament. The one savoured of perfidy to his religion, the other[a]\nof treachery to his sovereign. He preferred the latter. The first answer to\nhis offer he was induced to reject as derogatory from his honour: a second\nnegotiation followed; and he at last consented to resign to the parliament\nthe sword, the emblem of his office, the[b] castle of Dublin, and all the\nfortresses held by his troops, on the payment of a certain sum of money, a\ngrant of security for his person, and the restoration of his lands, which\nhad been sequestrated.

        "proper to notice the progress which had been made in the reformation of\nreligion. From the directory for public worship, the synod and the houses\nproceeded to the government of the church. They divided the kingdom into\nprovinces, the provinces into classes, and the classes into presbyteries\nor elderships; and established by successive votes a regular gradation of\nauthority among these new judicatories, which amounted, if we may believe\nthe ordinance, to no fewer than ten thousand. But neither of the great\nreligious parties was satisfied. 1. The Independents strongly objected to\nthe intolerance of the Presbyterian scheme;[1] and though willing that it\nshould be protected and countenanced by the state, they claimed a right\nto form, according to the dictates of their consciences, separate\ncongregations for themselves. Their complaints were received with a willing\near by the two houses, the members of which (so we are told by a Scottish\ndivine who attended the assembly at Westminster) might be divided into four\nclasses: the Presbyterians, who, in number and influence, surpassed any\none of the other three; the Independents, who, if few in number, were yet\ndistinguished by the superior talents and industry of their leaders; the\nlawyers, who looked with jealousy on any attempt to erect an ecclesiastical\npower independent of the legislature; and the men of irreligious habits,\nwho dreaded the stern and scrutinizing discipline of a Presbyterian kirk.\nThe two last occasionally",

Both were equally\ninflexible. The former would admit of no innovation in the powers which\nChrist, according to their creed, had bestowed on the presbytery; the\nlatter, rather than conform, expressed their readiness to suffer the\npenalties of the law, or to seek some other clime, where the enjoyment of\ncivil, was combined with that of religious, freedom.[1]",
        "2. The discontent of the Presbyterians arose from a very different\nsource. They complained that the parliament sacrilegiously usurped that\njurisdiction which Christ had vested exclusively in his church. The\nassembly contended, that “the keys of the kingdom of heaven were committed\nto the officers of the church, by virtue whereof, they have power\nrespectively to retain and remit sins, to shut the kingdom of heaven\nagainst the impenitent by censures, and to open it to the penitent by\nabsolution.” These claims of the divines were zealously supported by their\nbrethren in parliament, and as fiercely opposed by all who were not of\ntheir communion.

They arrogated\nto themselves the power of judging what offences should be deemed\nscandalous; the parliament defined the particular offences, and appointed\ncivil commissioners in each province, to whom the presbyteries should refer\nevery case not previously enumerated. They allowed of no appeal from the\necclesiastical tribunals to the civil magistrate; the parliament empowered\nall who thought themselves aggrieved to apply for redress to either of\nthe two houses.[1] This profane mutilation of the divine right of the\npresbyteries excited the alarm and execration of every orthodox believer.\nWhen the ordinance for carrying the new plan into execution was in progress\nthrough the Commons, the ministers generally determined not to act under\nits provisions. The citizens of London, who petitioned against it, were\nindeed silenced by a vote[a] that they had violated the privileges of the\nhouse; but the Scottish commissioners came to their aid with a demand that\nreligion should be regulated to the satisfaction of the church; and the\nassembly of divines ventured to remonstrate, that they could not\nin conscience submit to an imperfect and anti-scriptural form of\necclesiastical government. To the Scots a civil but unmeaning answer was\nreturned:[b] to alarm the assembly, it was resolved that the remonstrance\nwas a breach of privilege, and that nine questions should be proposed to\nthe divines, respecting the nature and object of the divine right to which\nthey pretended.

They observed a day of\nfasting and humiliation, to invoke the protection of God in favour of\nhis persecuted church; required the immediate attendance of their absent\ncolleagues; and then reluctantly entered on the consideration of the\nquestions sent to them from the Commons. In a few days, however, the king\ntook refuge in the Scottish army, and a new ray of hope cheered their\nafflicted spirits. Additional petitions were presented; the answer of the\ntwo houses became more accommodating; and the petitioners received thanks\nfor their zeal, with an assurance in conciliatory language that attention\nshould be paid to their requests. The immediate consequence was the\nabolition of the provincial commissioners; and the ministers, softened\nby this condescension, engaged to execute the ordinance in London and\nLancashire.[2] At the same time the assembly undertook the composition of a\ncatechism and confession of faith; but their progress was daily retarded by\nthe debates respecting the nine questions; and the influence of their party\nwas greatly diminished by the sudden death of the earl of Essex.[3][a]",
