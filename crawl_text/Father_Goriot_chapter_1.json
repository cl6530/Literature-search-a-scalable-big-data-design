        "     To the great and illustrious Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, a token\n     of admiration for his works and genius.\n                                                      De Balzac.",
        "Mme. Vauquer (nee de Conflans) is an elderly person, who for\nthe past forty years has kept a lodging-house in the Rue\nNueve-Sainte-Genevieve, in the district that lies between the\nLatin Quarter and the Faubourg Saint-Marcel. Her house (known in\nthe neighborhood as the Maison Vauquer) receives men and women,\nold and young, and no word has ever been breathed against her\nrespectable establishment; but, at the same time, it must be said\nthat as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for\nthirty years, and that if a young man stays there for any length of\ntime it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest.\nIn 1819, however, the time when this drama opens, there was an almost\npenniless young girl among Mme. Vauquer’s boarders.",
        "That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late; it has been\noverworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous\nliterature; but it must do service again here, not because this story\nis dramatic in the restricted sense of the word, but because some\ntears may perhaps be shed intra et extra muros before it is over.",
        "Will any one without the walls of Paris understand it? It is open to\ndoubt. The only audience who could appreciate the results of close\nobservation, the careful reproduction of minute detail and local\ncolor, are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre,\nin a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud, a vale\nof sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow; but this audience\nis so accustomed to terrible sensations, that only some unimaginable\nand well-neigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression\nthere. Now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by\nreason of the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about,\nthat egotism and selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to\npity; but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit,\nsoon consumed. Civilization, like the car of Juggernaut, is scarcely\nstayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less easy to break than\nthe others that lie in its course; this also is broken, and\nCivilization continues on her course triumphant. And you, too, will do\nthe like; you who with this book in your white hand will sink back\namong the cushions of your armchair, and say to yourself, “Perhaps\nthis may amuse me.” You will read the story of Father Goriot’s secret\nwoes, and, dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite, will lay the\nblame of your insensibility upon the writer, and accuse him of\nexaggeration, of writing romances. Ah! once for all, this drama is\nneither a fiction nor a romance! All is true,–so true, that every\none can discern the elements of the tragedy in his own house, perhaps\nin his own heart.",
        "The lodging-house is Mme. Vauquer’s own property. It is still standing\nin the lower end of the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, just where the\nroad slopes so sharply down to the Rue de l’Arbalete, that wheeled\ntraffic seldom passes that way, because it is so stony and steep. This\nposition is sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the\nstreets shut in between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of the\nVal-de-Grace, two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish\ntone to the landscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath\nthe shadow of their leaden-hued cupolas.",
        "In that district the pavements are clean and dry, there is neither mud\nnor water in the gutters, grass grows in the chinks of the walls. The\nmost heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place\nwhere the sound of wheels creates a sensation; there is a grim look\nabout the houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden\nwalls. A Parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of\nlodging-houses and public institutions would see poverty and dullness,\nold age lying down to die, and joyous youth condemned to drudgery. It\nis the ugliest quarter of Paris, and, it may be added, the least\nknown. But, before all things, the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve is like\na bronze frame for a picture for which the mind cannot be too well\nprepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images. Even so,\nstep by step the daylight decreases, and the cicerone’s droning voice\ngrows hollower as the traveler descends into the Catacombs. The\ncomparison holds good! Who shall say which is more ghastly, the sight\nof the bleached skulls or of dried-up human hearts?",
        "The front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road, and\nlooks out upon a little garden, so that you see the side of the house\nin section, as it were, from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. Beneath\nthe wall of the house front there lies a channel, a fathom wide, paved\nwith cobble-stones, and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by\ngeraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white\nglazed earthenware pots. Access into the graveled walk is afforded by\na door, above which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read, and beneath,\nin rather smaller letters, ’Lodgings for both sexes, etc.“",
        "During the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a\nwicket to which a bell is attached. On the opposite wall, at the\nfurther end of the graveled walk, a green marble arch was painted once\nupon a time by a local artist, and in this semblance of a shrine a\nstatue representing Cupid is installed; a Parisian Cupid, so blistered\nand disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent\nhospitals, and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism. The\nhalf-obliterated inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the\ndate of this work of art, for it bears witness to the widespread\nenthusiasm felt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in 1777:",
        "              “Whoe’er thou art, thy master see;\n               He is, or was, or ought to be.”",
        "At night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door. The little\ngarden is no wider than the front of the house; it is shut in between\nthe wall of the street and the partition wall of the neighboring\nhouse. A mantle of ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of\npassers-by to an effect which is picturesque in Paris, for each of the\nwalls is covered with trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop\nof fruit, and furnish besides a subject of conversation for Mme.\nVauquer and her lodgers; every year the widow trembles for her\nvintage.",
        "A straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads\nto a clump of lime-trees at the further end of it; line-trees, as\nMme. Vauquer persists in calling them, in spite of the fact that she\nwas a de Conflans, and regardless of repeated corrections from her\nlodgers.",
        "The central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and rows\nof pyramid fruit-trees, and surrounded by a border of lettuce,\npot-herbs, and parsley. Under the lime-trees there are a few\ngreen-painted garden seats and a wooden table, and hither, during the\ndog-days, such of the lodgers as are rich enough to indulge in a cup of\ncoffee come to take their pleasure, though it is hot enough to roast\neggs even in the shade.",
        "The house itself is three stories high, without counting the attics\nunder the roof. It is built of rough stone, and covered with the\nyellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in\nParis. There are five windows in each story in the front of the house;\nall the blinds visible through the small square panes are drawn up\nawry, so that the lines are all at cross purposes. At the side of the\nhouse there are but two windows on each floor, and the lowest of all\nare adorned with a heavy iron grating.",
        "Behind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet, a space\ninhabited by a happy family of pigs, poultry, and rabbits; the\nwood-shed is situated on the further side, and on the wall between\nthe wood-shed and the kitchen window hangs the meat-safe, just above\nthe place where the sink discharges its greasy streams. The cook\nsweeps all the refuse out through a little door into the Rue\nNueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and frequently cleanses the yard with\ncopious supplies of water, under pain of pestilence.",
        "The house might have been built on purpose for its present uses.\nAccess is given by a French window to the first room on the ground\nfloor, a sitting-room which looks out upon the street through the two\nbarred windows already mentioned. Another door opens out of it into\nthe dining-room, which is separated from the kitchen by the well of\nthe staircase, the steps being constructed partly of wood, partly of\ntiles, which are colored and beeswaxed. Nothing can be more depressing\nthan the sight of that sitting-room. The furniture is covered with\nhorse hair woven in alternate dull and glossy stripes. There is a\nround table in the middle, with a purplish-red marble top, on which\nthere stands, by way of ornament, the inevitable white china\ntea-service, covered with a half-effaced gilt network. The floor is\nsufficiently uneven, the wainscot rises to elbow height, and the rest\nof the wall space is decorated with a varnished paper, on which the\nprincipal scenes from Telemaque are depicted, the various classical\npersonages being colored. The subject between the two windows is the\nbanquet given by Calypso to the son of Ulysses, displayed thereon for\nthe admiration of the boarders, and has furnished jokes these forty\nyears to the young men who show themselves superior to their position\nby making fun of the dinners to which poverty condemns them. The\nhearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident that a fire is\nonly kindled there on great occasions; the stone chimney-piece is\nadorned by a couple of vases filled with faded artificial flowers\nimprisoned under glass shades, on either side of a bluish marble clock\nin the very worst taste.",
        "The first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the\nlanguage, and which should be called the odeur de pension. The damp\natmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it; it has a\nstuffy, musty, and rancid quality; it permeates your clothing;\nafter-dinner scents seem to be mingled in it with smells from the\nkitchen and scullery and the reek of a hospital. It might be possible\nto describe it if some one should discover a process by which to\ndistil from the atmosphere all the nauseating elements with which it\nis charged by the catarrhal exhalations of every individual lodger,\nyoung or old. Yet, in spite of these stale horrors, the sitting-room\nis as charming and as delicately perfumed as a boudoir, when compared\nwith the adjoining dining-room.",
        "The paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color, now\na matter of conjecture, for the surface is incrusted with accumulated\nlayers of grimy deposit, which cover it with fantastic outlines. A\ncollection of dim-ribbed glass decanters, metal discs with a satin\nsheen on them, and piles of blue-edged earthenware plates of Touraine\nware cover the sticky surfaces of the sideboards that line the room.\nIn a corner stands a box containing a set of numbered pigeon-holes, in\nwhich the lodgers’ table napkins, more or less soiled and stained with\nwine, are kept. Here you see that indestructible furniture never met\nwith elsewhere, which finds its way into lodging-houses much as the\nwrecks of our civilization drift into hospitals for incurables. You\nexpect in such places as these to find the weather-house whence a\nCapuchin issues on wet days; you look to find the execrable engravings\nwhich spoil your appetite, framed every one in a black varnished\nframe, with a gilt beading round it; you know the sort of\ntortoise-shell clock-case, inlaid with brass; the green stove, the\nArgand lamps, covered with oil and dust, have met your eyes before.\nThe oilcloth which covers the long table is so greasy that a waggish\nexterne will write his name on the surface, using his thumb-nail as a\nstyle. The chairs are broken-down invalids; the wretched little hempen\nmats slip away from under your feet without slipping away for good;\nand finally, the foot-warmers are miserable wrecks, hingeless,\ncharred, broken away about the holes. It would be impossible to give\nan idea of the old, rotten, shaky, cranky, worm-eaten, halt, maimed,\none-eyed, rickety, and ramshackle condition of the furniture without\nan exhaustive description, which would delay the progress of the story\nto an extent that impatient people would not pardon. The red tiles of\nthe floor are full of depressions brought about by scouring and\nperiodical renewings of color. In short, there is no illusory grace\nleft to the poverty that reigns here; it is dire, parsimonious,\nconcentrated, threadbare poverty; as yet it has not sunk into the\nmire, it is only splashed by it, and though not in rags as yet, its\nclothing is ready to drop to pieces.",
        "This apartment is in all its glory at seven o’clock in the morning,\nwhen Mme. Vauquer’s cat appears, announcing the near approach of his\nmistress, and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk in the\nbowls, each protected by a plate, while he purrs his morning greeting\nto the world. A moment later the widow shows her face; she is tricked\nout in a net cap attached to a false front set on awry, and shuffles\ninto the room in her slipshod fashion. She is an oldish woman, with a\nbloated countenance, and a nose like a parrot’s beak set in the middle\nof it; her fat little hands (she is as sleek as a church rat) and her\nshapeless, slouching figure are in keeping with the room that reeks of\nmisfortune, where hope is reduced to speculate for the meanest stakes.\nMme. Vauquer alone can breathe that tainted air without being\ndisheartened by it. Her face is as fresh as a frosty morning in\nautumn; there are wrinkles about the eyes that vary in their\nexpression from the set smile of a ballet-dancer to the dark,\nsuspicious scowl of a discounter of bills; in short, she is at once\nthe embodiment and interpretation of her lodging-house, as surely as\nher lodging-house implies the existence of its mistress. You can no\nmore imagine the one without the other, than you can think of a jail\nwithout a turnkey. The unwholesome corpulence of the little woman is\nproduced by the life she leads, just as typhus fever is bred in the\ntainted air of a hospital. The very knitted woolen petticoat that she\nwears beneath a skirt made of an old gown, with the wadding protruding\nthrough the rents in the material, is a sort of epitome of the\nsitting-room, the dining-room, and the little garden; it discovers the\ncook, it foreshadows the lodgers–the picture of the house is\ncompleted by the portrait of its mistress.",
        "Mme. Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who “have seen a\ndeal of trouble.” She has the glassy eyes and innocent air of a\ntrafficker in flesh and blood, who will wax virtuously indignant to\nobtain a higher price for her services, but who is quite ready to\nbetray a Georges or a Pichegru, if a Georges or a Pichegru were in\nhiding and still to be betrayed, or for any other expedient that may\nalleviate her lot. Still, “she is a good woman at bottom,” said the\nlodgers who believed that the widow was wholly dependent upon the\nmoney that they paid her, and sympathized when they heard her cough\nand groan like one of themselves.",
        "What had M. Vauquer been? The lady was never very explicit on this\nhead. How had she lost her money? “Through trouble,” was her answer.\nHe had treated her badly, had left her nothing but her eyes to cry\nover his cruelty, the house she lived in, and the privilege of pitying\nnobody, because, so she was wont to say, she herself had been through\nevery possible misfortune.",
        "Sylvie, the stout cook, hearing her mistress’ shuffling footsteps,\nhastened to serve the lodgers’ breakfasts. Beside those who lived in\nthe house, Mme. Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals; but\nthese externes usually only came to dinner, for which they paid\nthirty francs a month.",
        "At the time when this story begins, the lodging-house contained seven\ninmates. The best rooms in the house were on the first story, Mme.\nVauquer herself occupying the least important, while the rest were let\nto a Mme. Couture, the widow of a commissary-general in the service of\nthe Republic. With her lived Victorine Taillefer, a schoolgirl, to\nwhom she filled the place of mother. These two ladies paid eighteen\nhundred francs a year.",
        "The two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied\nby an old man named Poiret and a man of forty or thereabouts, the\nwearer of a black wig and dyed whiskers, who gave out that he was a\nretired merchant, and was addressed as M. Vautrin. Two of the four\nrooms on the third floor were also let–one to an elderly spinster, a\nMlle. Michonneau, and the other to a retired manufacturer of\nvermicelli, Italian paste and starch, who allowed the others to\naddress him as “Father Goriot.” The remaining rooms were allotted to\nvarious birds of passage, to impecunious students, who like “Father\nGoriot” and Mlle. Michonneau, could only muster forty-five francs a\nmonth to pay for their board and lodging. Mme. Vauquer had little\ndesire for lodgers of this sort; they ate too much bread, and she only\ntook them in default of better.",
        "At that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student, a young\nman from the neighborhood of Angouleme, one of a large family who\npinched and starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs a year\nfor him. Misfortune had accustomed Eugene de Rastignac, for that was\nhis name, to work. He belonged to the number of young men who know as\nchildren that their parents’ hopes are centered on them, and\ndeliberately prepare themselves for a great career, subordinating\ntheir studies from the first to this end, carefully watching the\nindications of the course of events, calculating the probable turn\nthat affairs will take, that they may be the first to profit by them.\nBut for his observant curiosity, and the skill with which he managed\nto introduce himself into the salons of Paris, this story would not\nhave been colored by the tones of truth which it certainly owes to\nhim, for they are entirely due to his penetrating sagacity and desire\nto fathom the mysteries of an appalling condition of things, which was\nconcealed as carefully by the victim as by those who had brought it to\npass.",
        "Above the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to\ndry, and a couple of attics. Christophe, the man-of-all-work, slept in\none, and Sylvie, the stout cook, in the other. Beside the seven\ninmates thus enumerated, taking one year with another, some eight law\nor medical students dined in the house, as well as two or three\nregular comers who lived in the neighborhood. There were usually\neighteen people at dinner, and there was room, if need be, for twenty\nat Mme. Vauquer’s table; at breakfast, however, only the seven lodgers\nappeared. It was almost like a family party. Every one came down in\ndressing-gown and slippers, and the conversation usually turned on\nanything that had happened the evening before; comments on the dress\nor appearance of the dinner contingent were exchanged in friendly\nconfidence.",
        "These seven lodgers were Mme. Vauquer’s spoiled children. Among them\nshe distributed, with astronomical precision, the exact proportion of\nrespect and attention due to the varying amounts they paid for their\nboard. One single consideration influenced all these human beings\nthrown together by chance. The two second-floor lodgers only paid\nseventy-two francs a month. Such prices as these are confined to the\nFaubourg Saint-Marcel and the district between La Bourbe and the\nSalpetriere; and, as might be expected, poverty, more or less\napparent, weighed upon them all, Mme. Couture being the sole exception\nto the rule.",
        "The dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates\nof the house; all were alike threadbare. The color of the men’s coats\nwere problematical; such shoes, in more fashionable quarters, are only\nto be seen lying in the gutter; the cuffs and collars were worn and\nfrayed at the edges; every limp article of clothing looked like the\nghost of its former self. The women’s dresses were faded,\nold-fashioned, dyed and re-dyed; they wore gloves that were glazed\nwith hard wear, much-mended lace, dingy ruffles, crumpled muslin\nfichus. So much for their clothing; but, for the most part, their\nframes were solid enough; their constitutions had weathered the storms\nof life; their cold, hard faces were worn like coins that have been\nwithdrawn from circulation, but there were greedy teeth behind the\nwithered lips. Dramas brought to a close or still in progress are\nforeshadowed by the sight of such actors as these, not the dramas that\nare played before the footlights and against a background of painted\ncanvas, but dumb dramas of life, frost-bound dramas that sere hearts\nlike fire, dramas that do not end with the actors’ lives.",
        "Mlle. Michonneau, that elderly young lady, screened her weak eyes from\nthe daylight by a soiled green silk shade with a rim of brass, an\nobject fit to scare away the Angel of Pity himself. Her shawl, with\nits scanty, draggled fringe, might have covered a skeleton, so meagre\nand angular was the form beneath it. Yet she must have been pretty and\nshapely once. What corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines? Was\nit trouble, or vice, or greed? Had she loved too well? Had she been a\nsecond-hand clothes dealer, a frequenter of the backstairs of great\nhouses, or had she been merely a courtesan? Was she expiating the\nflaunting triumphs of a youth overcrowded with pleasures by an old age\nin which she was shunned by every passer-by? Her vacant gaze sent a\nchill through you; her shriveled face seemed like a menace. Her voice\nwas like the shrill, thin note of the grasshopper sounding from the\nthicket when winter is at hand. She said that she had nursed an old\ngentleman, ill of catarrh of the bladder, and left to die by his\nchildren, who thought that he had nothing left. His bequest to her, a\nlife annuity of a thousand francs, was periodically disputed by his\nheirs, who mingled slander with their persecutions. In spite of the\nravages of conflicting passions, her face retained some traces of its\nformer fairness and fineness of tissue, some vestiges of the physical\ncharms of her youth still survived.",
        "M. Poiret was a sort of automaton. He might be seen any day sailing\nlike a gray shadow along the walks of the Jardin des Plantes, on his\nhead a shabby cap, a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the tips\nof his thin fingers; the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat\nfailed to conceal his meagre figure; his breeches hung loosely on his\nshrunken limbs; the thin, blue-stockinged legs trembled like those of\na drunken man; there was a notable breach of continuity between the\ndingy white waistcoat and crumpled shirt frills and the cravat twisted\nabout a throat like a turkey gobbler’s; altogether, his appearance set\npeople wondering whether this outlandish ghost belonged to the\naudacious race of the sons of Japhet who flutter about on the\nBoulevard Italien. What devouring kind of toil could have so shriveled\nhim? What devouring passions had darkened that bulbous countenance,\nwhich would have seemed outrageous as a caricature? What had he been?\nWell, perhaps he had been part of the machinery of justice, a clerk in\nthe office to which the executioner sends in his accounts,–so much\nfor providing black veils for parricides, so much for sawdust, so much\nfor pulleys and cord for the knife. Or he might have been a receiver\nat the door of a public slaughter-house, or a sub-inspector of\nnuisances. Indeed, the man appeared to have been one of the beasts of\nburden in our great social mill; one of those Parisian Ratons whom\ntheir Bertrands do not even know by sight; a pivot in the obscure\nmachinery that disposes of misery and things unclean; one of those\nmen, in short, at sight of whom we are prompted to remark that, “After\nall, we cannot do without them.”",
        "Stately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral\nor physical suffering; but, then, Paris is in truth an ocean that no\nline can plumb. You may survey its surface and describe it; but no\nmatter how numerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea, there\nwill always be lonely and unexplored regions in its depths, caverns\nunknown, flowers and pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or\nforgotten by the divers of literature. The Maison Vauquer is one of\nthese curious monstrosities.",
        "Two, however, of Mme. Vauquer’s boarders formed a striking contrast to\nthe rest. There was a sickly pallor, such as is often seen in anaemic\ngirls, in Mlle. Victorine Taillefer’s face; and her unvarying\nexpression of sadness, like her embarrassed manner and pinched look,\nwas in keeping with the general wretchedness of the establishment in\nthe Rue Nueve-Saint-Genevieve, which forms a background to this\npicture; but her face was young, there was youthfulness in her voice\nand elasticity in her movements. This young misfortune was not unlike\na shrub, newly planted in an uncongenial soil, where its leaves have\nalready begun to wither. The outlines of her figure, revealed by her\ndress of the simplest and cheapest materials, were also youthful.\nThere was the same kind of charm about her too slender form, her\nfaintly colored face and light-brown hair, that modern poets find in\nmediaeval statuettes; and a sweet expression, a look of Christian\nresignation in the dark gray eyes. She was pretty by force of\ncontrast; if she had been happy, she would have been charming.\nHappiness is the poetry of woman, as the toilette is her tinsel. If\nthe delightful excitement of a ball had made the pale face glow with\ncolor; if the delights of a luxurious life had brought the color to\nthe wan cheeks that were slightly hollowed already; if love had put\nlight into the sad eyes, then Victorine might have ranked among the\nfairest; but she lacked the two things which create woman a second\ntime–pretty dresses and love-letters.",
        "A book might have been made of her story. Her father was persuaded\nthat he had sufficient reason for declining to acknowledge her, and\nallowed her a bare six hundred francs a year; he had further taken\nmeasures to disinherit his daughter, and had converted all his real\nestate into personalty, that he might leave it undivided to his son.\nVictorine’s mother had died broken-hearted in Mme. Couture’s house;\nand the latter, who was a near relation, had taken charge of the\nlittle orphan. Unluckily, the widow of the commissary-general to the\narmies of the Republic had nothing in the world but her jointure and\nher widow’s pension, and some day she might be obliged to leave the\nhelpless, inexperienced girl to the mercy of the world. The good soul,\ntherefore, took Victorine to mass every Sunday, and to confession once\na fortnight, thinking that, in any case, she would bring up her ward\nto be devout. She was right; religion offered a solution of the\nproblem of the young girl’s future. The poor child loved the father\nwho refused to acknowledge her. Once every year she tried to see him\nto deliver her mother’s message of forgiveness, but every year\nhitherto she had knocked at that door in vain; her father was\ninexorable. Her brother, her only means of communication, had not come\nto see her for four years, and had sent her no assistance; yet she\nprayed to God to unseal her father’s eyes and to soften her brother’s\nheart, and no accusations mingled with her prayers. Mme. Couture and\nMme. Vauquer exhausted the vocabulary of abuse, and failed to find\nwords that did justice to the banker’s iniquitous conduct; but while\nthey heaped execrations on the millionaire, Victorine’s words were as\ngentle as the moan of the wounded dove, and affection found expression\neven in the cry drawn from her by pain.",
        "Eugene de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type; he had a fair\ncomplexion, blue eyes, black hair. In his figure, manner, and his\nwhole bearing it was easy to see that he had either come of a noble\nfamily, or that, from his earliest childhood, he had been gently bred.\nIf he was careful of his wardrobe, only taking last year’s clothes\ninto daily wear, still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young\nman of fashion. Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat, the\nlimp black cravat, untidily knotted, that students affect, trousers\nthat matched the rest of his costume, and boots that had been resoled.",
        "Vautrin (the man of forty with the dyed whiskers) marked a transition\nstage between these two young people and the others. He was the kind\nof man that calls forth the remark: “He looks a jovial sort!” He had\nbroad shoulders, a well-developed chest, muscular arms, and strong\nsquare-fisted hands; the joints of his fingers were covered with tufts\nof fiery red hair. His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles; there\nwas a certain hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating\nmanner. His bass voice was by no means unpleasant, and was in keeping\nwith his boisterous laughter. He was always obliging, always in good\nspirits; if anything went wrong with one of the locks, he would soon\nunscrew it, take it to pieces, file it, oil and clean and set it in\norder, and put it back in its place again; “I am an old hand at it,\"\nhe used to say. Not only so, he knew all about ships, the sea, France,\nforeign countries, men, business, law, great houses and prisons,\n–there was nothing that he did not know. If any one complained rather\nmore than usual, he would offer his services at once. He had several\ntimes lent money to Mme. Vauquer, or to the boarders; but, somehow,\nthose whom he obliged felt that they would sooner face death than fail\nto repay him; a certain resolute look, sometimes seen on his face,\ninspired fear of him, for all his appearance of easy good-nature. In\nthe way he spat there was an imperturbable coolness which seemed to\nindicate that this was a man who would not stick at a crime to\nextricate himself from a false position. His eyes, like those of a\npitiless judge, seemed to go to the very bottom of all questions, to\nread all natures, all feelings and thoughts. His habit of life was\nvery regular; he usually went out after breakfast, returning in time\nfor dinner, and disappeared for the rest of the evening, letting\nhimself in about midnight with a latch key, a privilege that Mme.\nVauquer accorded to no other boarder. But then he was on very good\nterms with the widow; he used to call her “mamma,” and put his arm\nround her waist, a piece of flattery perhaps not appreciated to the\nfull! The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat; but, as\na matter of fact, no arm but Vautrin’s was long enough to encircle\nher.",
        "It was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs\na month for the cup of coffee with a dash of brandy in it, which he\ntook after dinner. Less superficial observers than young men engulfed\nby the whirlpool of Parisian life, or old men, who took no interest in\nanything that did not directly concern them, would not have stopped\nshort at the vaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin made upon\nthem. He knew or guessed the concerns of every one about him; but none\nof them had been able to penetrate his thoughts, or to discover his\noccupation. He had deliberately made his apparent good-nature, his\nunfailing readiness to oblige, and his high spirits into a barrier\nbetween himself and the rest of them, but not seldom he gave glimpses\nof appalling depths of character. He seemed to delight in scourging\nthe upper classes of society with the lash of his tongue, to take\npleasure in convicting it of inconsistency, in mocking at law and\norder with some grim jest worthy of Juvenal, as if some grudge against\nthe social system rankled in him, as if there were some mystery\ncarefully hidden away in his life.",
        "Mlle. Taillefer felt attracted, perhaps unconsciously, by the strength\nof the one man, and the good looks of the other; her stolen glances\nand secret thoughts were divided between them; but neither of them\nseemed to take any notice of her, although some day a chance might\nalter her position, and she would be a wealthy heiress. For that\nmatter, there was not a soul in the house who took any trouble to\ninvestigate the various chronicles of misfortunes, real or imaginary,\nrelated by the rest. Each one regarded the others with indifference,\ntempered by suspicion; it was a natural result of their relative\npositions. Practical assistance not one could give, this they all\nknew, and they had long since exhausted their stock of condolence over\nprevious discussions of their grievances. They were in something the\nsame position as an elderly couple who have nothing left to say to\neach other. The routine of existence kept them in contact, but they\nwere parts of a mechanism which wanted oil. There was not one of them\nbut would have passed a blind man begging in the street, not one that\nfelt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune, not one who did not see in\ndeath the solution of the all-absorbing problem of misery which left\nthem cold to the most terrible anguish in others.",
        "The happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Mme. Vauquer, who\nreigned supreme over this hospital supported by voluntary\ncontributions. For her, the little garden, which silence, and cold,\nand rain, and drought combined to make as dreary as an Asian steppe,\nwas a pleasant shaded nook; the gaunt yellow house, the musty odors of\na back shop had charms for her, and for her alone. Those cells\nbelonged to her. She fed those convicts condemned to penal servitude\nfor life, and her authority was recognized among them. Where else in\nParis would they have found wholesome food in sufficient quantity at\nthe prices she charged them, and rooms which they were at liberty to\nmake, if not exactly elegant or comfortable, at any rate clean and\nhealthy? If she had committed some flagrant act of injustice, the\nvictim would have borne it in silence.",
        "Such a gathering contained, as might have been expected, the elements\nout of which a complete society might be constructed. And, as in a\nschool, as in the world itself, there was among the eighteen men and\nwomen who met round the dinner table a poor creature, despised by all\nthe others, condemned to be the butt of all their jokes. At the\nbeginning of Eugene de Rastignac’s second twelvemonth, this figure\nsuddenly started out into bold relief against the background of human\nforms and faces among which the law student was yet to live for\nanother two years to come. This laughing-stock was the retired\nvermicelli-merchant, Father Goriot, upon whose face a painter, like\nthe historian, would have concentrated all the light in his picture.",
        "How had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a\nhalf-malignant contempt? Why did they subject the oldest among their\nnumber to a kind of persecution, in which there was mingled some pity,\nbut no respect for his misfortunes? Had he brought it on himself by\nsome eccentricity or absurdity, which is less easily forgiven or\nforgotten than more serious defects? The question strikes at the root\nof many a social injustice. Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict\nsuffering on anything that will endure suffering, whether by reason of\nits genuine humility, or indifference, or sheer helplessness. Do we not,\none and all, like to feel our strength even at the expense of some one\nor of something? The poorest sample of humanity, the street arab, will\npull the bell handle at every street door in bitter weather, and\nscramble up to write his name on the unsullied marble of a monument.",
        "In the year 1813, at the age of sixty-nine or thereabouts, “Father\nGoriot” had sold his business and retired–to Mme. Vauquer’s boarding\nhouse. When he first came there he had taken the rooms now occupied by\nMme. Couture; he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to\nwhom five louis more or less was a mere trifle. For him Mme. Vauquer\nhad made various improvements in the three rooms destined for his use,\nin consideration of a certain sum paid in advance, so it was said, for\nthe miserable furniture, that is to say, for some yellow cotton\ncurtains, a few chairs of stained wood covered with Utrecht velvet,\nseveral wretched colored prints in frames, and wall papers that a\nlittle suburban tavern would have disdained. Possibly it was the\ncareless generosity with which Father Goriot allowed himself to be\noverreached at this period of his life (they called him Monsieur\nGoriot very respectfully then) that gave Mme. Vauquer the meanest\nopinion of his business abilities; she looked on him as an imbecile\nwhere money was concerned.",
