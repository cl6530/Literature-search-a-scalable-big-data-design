        "“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.  I thought of the\noccurrences of the day.  What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners\nof these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.  I\nremembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from\nthe barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I\nmight hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would\nremain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the\nmotives which influenced their actions.",
        "“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.  The young woman\narranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed\nafter the first meal.",
        "“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.\nThe young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in\nvarious laborious occupations within.  The old man, whom I soon\nperceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or\nin contemplation.  Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the\nyounger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.  They\nperformed towards him every little office of affection and duty with\ngentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.",
        "“They were not entirely happy.  The young man and his companion often\nwent apart and appeared to weep.  I saw no cause for their unhappiness,\nbut I was deeply affected by it.  If such lovely creatures were\nmiserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\nshould be wretched.  Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?  They\npossessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every\nluxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands\nwhen hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\nthey enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day\nlooks of affection and kindness.  What did their tears imply?  Did they\nreally express pain?  I was at first unable to solve these questions,\nbut perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which\nwere at first enigmatic.",
        "“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\nthe uneasiness of this amiable family:  it was poverty, and they\nsuffered that evil in a very distressing degree.  Their nourishment\nconsisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of\none cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters\ncould scarcely procure food to support it.  They often, I believe,\nsuffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two\nyounger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\nman when they reserved none for themselves.",
        "“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.  I had been accustomed,\nduring the night, to steal a part of their store for my own\nconsumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on\nthe cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and\nroots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.",
        "“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\ntheir labours.  I found that the youth spent a great part of each day\nin collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often\ntook his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\nfiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.",
        "“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\nopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a\ngreat pile of wood on the outside.  She uttered some words in a loud\nvoice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise.  I\nobserved, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but\nspent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.",
        "“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.  I found that\nthese people possessed a method of communicating their experience and\nfeelings to one another by articulate sounds.  I perceived that the\nwords they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or\nsadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers.  This was indeed\na godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with\nit.  But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose.  Their\npronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any\napparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any\nclue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.  By great\napplication, however, and after having remained during the space of\nseveral revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names\nthat were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I\nlearned and applied the words, `fire,’ `milk,’ `bread,’ and `wood.’  I\nlearned also the names of the cottagers themselves.  The youth and his\ncompanion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one,\nwhich was `father.’ The girl was called `sister’ or `Agatha,’ and the\nyouth `Felix,’ `brother,’ or `son.’  I cannot describe the delight I\nfelt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and\nwas able to pronounce them.  I distinguished several other words\nwithout being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as `good,’\n`dearest,’ `unhappy.’",
        "“I spent the winter in this manner.  The gentle manners and beauty of\nthe cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I\nfelt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys.  I saw\nfew human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the\ncottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\nsuperior accomplishments of my friends.  The old man, I could perceive,\noften endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\nhe called them, to cast off their melancholy.  He would talk in a\ncheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\neven upon me.  Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\nwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\ngenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father.  It was not thus\nwith Felix.  He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my\nunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\nfriends.  But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\ncheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\nman.",
        "“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked\nthe dispositions of these amiable cottagers.  In the midst of poverty\nand want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little\nwhite flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.  Early in\nthe morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that\nobstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and\nbrought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual\nastonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\nhand.  In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring\nfarmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,\nyet brought no wood with him.  At other times he worked in the garden,\nbut as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old\nman and Agatha.",
        "“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I\ndiscovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when\nhe talked.  I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\nfor speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\nthese also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand\nthe sounds for which they stood as signs?  I improved, however,\nsensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\nconversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I\neasily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\nthe cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become\nmaster of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them\noverlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast\nperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.",
        "“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers–their grace, beauty,\nand delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself\nin a transparent pool!  At first I started back, unable to believe that\nit was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became\nfully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was\nfilled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. \nAlas!  I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable\ndeformity.",
        "“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow\nvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.  From this\ntime Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of\nimpending famine disappeared.  Their food, as I afterwards found, was\ncoarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. \nSeveral new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they\ndressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season\nadvanced.",
        "“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\nnot rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\nwaters.  This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the\nearth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.",
        "“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.  During the morning I\nattended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in\nvarious occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in\nobserving my friends.  When they had retired to rest, if there was any\nmoon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected\nmy own food and fuel for the cottage.  When I returned, as often as it\nwas necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those\noffices that I had seen done by Felix.  I afterwards found that these\nlabours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\nonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words `good\nspirit,’ `wonderful’; but I did not then understand the signification\nof these terms.",
        "“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the\nmotives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to\nknow why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.  I thought\n(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to\nthese deserving people.  When I slept or was absent, the forms of the\nvenerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix\nflitted before me.  I looked upon them as superior beings who would be\nthe arbiters of my future destiny.  I formed in my imagination a\nthousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of\nme.  I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle\ndemeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and\nafterwards their love.",
        "“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to\nthe acquiring the art of language.  My organs were indeed harsh, but\nsupple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their\ntones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.\nIt was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose\nintentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved\nbetter treatment than blows and execration.",
        "“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the\naspect of the earth.  Men who before this change seemed to have been\nhid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of\ncultivation.  The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves\nbegan to bud forth on the trees.  Happy, happy earth!  Fit habitation\nfor gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and\nunwholesome.  My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of\nnature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,\nand the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”",
