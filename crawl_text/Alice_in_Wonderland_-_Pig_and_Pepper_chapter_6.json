        "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\nfish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened\nby another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.",
        "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”",
        "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.",
        "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\nfor fear of their hearing her; and, when she next peeped out, the\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near\nthe door, staring stupidly up into the sky.",
        "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.",
        "“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\ntwo reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\nare: secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one\ncould possibly hear you.” And certainly there was a most\nextraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing,\nand every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been\nbroken to pieces.",
        "“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”",
        "“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on,\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For\ninstance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you\nout, you know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was\nspeaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he\ncan’t help it,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so very nearly at\nthe top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions—How am\nI to get in?” she repeated, aloud.",
        "“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till to-morrow—”",
        "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.",
        "“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone,\nexactly as if nothing had happened.",
        "“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.",
        "“Are you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\nquestion, you know.”",
        "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\nIt’s enough to drive one crazy!”",
        "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\ndays and days.”",
        "“But what am I to do?” said Alice.",
        "“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.",
        "“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.",
        "",
        "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\none end to the other; the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\nin the middle, nursing a baby: the cook was leaning over the fire,\nstirring a large caldron which seemed to be full of soup.",
        "“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.",
        "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess\nsneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moment’s pause. The only two creatures in the\nkitchen, that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat, which\nwas lying on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.",
        "“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first,\n“why your cat grins like that?”",
        "“It’s a Cheshire-Cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”",
        "",
        "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:",
        "“I didn’t know that Cheshire-Cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\nknow that cats would grin.”",
        "“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”",
        "“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said, very politely, feeling\nquite pleased to have got into a conversation.",
        "“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”",
        "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it\nwould be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.\nWhile she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the caldron of soup\noff the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her\nreach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then\nfollowed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took\nno notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so\nmuch already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows\nhurt it or not.",
        "“Oh, please mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and\ndown in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his precious nose!” as\nan unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried\nit off.",
        "“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said, in a\nhoarse growl, “the world would go around a deal faster than it does.”",
        "“Which would not be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\nthink what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”",
        "“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”",
        "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to\ntake the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed\nnot to be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I\nthink; or is it twelve? I—”",
        "“Oh, don’t bother me!” said the Duchess. “I never could abide\nfigures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\nthe end of every line:—",
        "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:",
        "“Here! You may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to\nAlice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready\nto play croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The\ncook threw a frying-pan after her as she went, but it just missed her.",
        "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\n“just like a star fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",
        "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself), she carried\nit out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,\"\nthought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two. Wouldn’t it\nbe murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and\nthe little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this\ntime). “Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\nexpressing yourself.”",
        "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it\nhad a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose:\nalso its eyes were getting extremely small for I a baby: altogether\nAlice did not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was\nonly sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if\nthere were any tears.",
        "No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear\"\nsaid Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\nnow!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was\nimpossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.",
        "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\nwith this creature, when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\nthere could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less\nthan a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to\ncarry it any further.",
        "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\nherself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of\na tree a few yards off.",
        "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\nthought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.",
        "“Cheshire-Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\nwider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on:\n“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”",
        "“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.",
        "“I don’t much care where—,” said Alice.",
        "“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.",
        "“—so long as I get somewhere,” Alice added as an explanation.",
        "“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\nenough.”",
        "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\nquestion. “What sort of people live about here?”",
        "“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round,\n“lives a Hatter: and in that direction,” waving the other paw,\n“lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”",
        "“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.",
        "“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\nYou’re mad.”",
        "“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.",
        "“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”",
        "Alice didn’t think that proved it at all: however, she went on: “And\nhow do you know that you’re mad?”",
        "“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”",
        "“I suppose so,” said Alice.",
        "“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see a dog growls when it’s angry,\nand wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased,\nand wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”",
        "“I call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.",
        "“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\nQueen to-day?”",
        "“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\nyet.”",
        "“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.",
        "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so well used to\nqueer things happening. While she was still looking at the place where\nit had been, it suddenly appeared again.",
        "“By the by, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\nforgotten to ask.”",
        "“It turned into a pig,” Alice answered very quietly, just is if the\nCat had come back in a natural way.",
        "“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.",
        "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\nsaid to herself: “the March Hare will be much the most interesting,\nand perhaps, as this is May, it won’t be raving mad—at least not so\nmad as it was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there\nwas the Cat again sitting on a branch of a tree.",
        "“Did you say ’pig,’ or ’fig’?” said the Cat.",
        "“I said ’pig’,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy!”",
        "“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.",
        "“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\ngrin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in all my\nlife!”",
        "She had not gone much further before she came in sight of the house of\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\nnibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up toward it rather\ntimidly, saying to herself, “Suppose it should be raving mad after\nall! I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”",
