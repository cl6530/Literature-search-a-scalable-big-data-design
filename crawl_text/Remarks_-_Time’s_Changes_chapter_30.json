        "I fixed myself and went out trout fishing on the only original\nKinnickinnick river last week. It was a kind of Rip Van Winkle picnic and\nfarewell moonlight excursion home. I believe that Rip Van Winkle, however,\nconfined himself to hunting mostly with an old musket that was on the\nretired list when Rip took his sleepy drink on the Catskills. If he could\nhave gone with me fishing last week over the old trail, digging\nangle-worms at the same old place where I left the spade sticking in the\ngrim soil twenty years ago–if we could have waded down the Kinnickinnick\ntogether with high rubber boots on, and got nibbles and bites at the same\nplaces, and found the same old farmers with nearly a quarter of a century\nadded to their lives and glistening in their hair, we would have had fun\nno doubt on that day, and a headache on the day following. This affords me\nan opportunity to say that trout may be caught successfully without a\ncorkscrew. I have tried it. I’ve about decided that the main reason why so\nmany large lies are told about the number of trout caught all over the\ncountry, is that at the moment the sportsman pulls his game out of the\nwater, he labors under some kind of an optical illusion, by reason of\nwhich he sees about nine trout where he ought to see only one.",
        "I wish I had as many dollars as I have soaked deceased angle-worms in that\nsame beautiful Kinnickinnick. There was a little stream made into it that\nwe called Tidd’s creek. It is still there. This stream runs across Tidd’s\nfarm, and Tidd twenty years ago wouldn’t allow anybody to fish in the\ncreek. I can still remember how his large hand used to feel, as he caught\nme by the nape of the neck and threw me over the fence with my amateur\nfishing tackle and a willow “stringer” with eleven dried, stiff trout on\nit. Last week I thought I would try Tidd’s creek again. It was always a\ngood place to fish, and I felt the same old excitement, with just enough\nvague forebodings in it to make it pleasant. Still, I had grown a foot or\nso since I used to fish there, and perhaps I could return the compliment\nby throwing the old gentleman over his own fence, and then hiss in his ear\n“R-r-r-r-e-v-e-n-g-e!!!”",
        "I had got pretty well across the “lower forty” and had about decided that\nTidd had been gathered to his fathers, when I saw him coming with his head\nup like a steer in the corn. Tidd is a blacksmith by trade, and he has an\narm with hair on it that looks like Jumbo’s hind leg. I felt the same old\ndesire to climb the fence and be alone. I didn’t know exactly how to work\nit. Then I remembered how people had remarked that I had changed very much\nin twenty years, and that for a homely boy I had grown to be a remarkably\npicturesque-looking man. I trusted to Tidd’s failing eyesight and said:",
        "“How are you?”",
        "He said, “How are you?” That did not answer my question, but I didn’t mind\na little thing like that.",
        "Then he said: “I sposed that every pesky fool in this country knew I don’t\nallow fishing on my land.”",
        "“That may be,” says I, “but I ain’t fishing on your land. I always fish in\na damp place if I can. Moreover, how do I know this is your land? Carrying\nthe argument still further, and admitting that every peesky fool knows\nthat you didn’t allow fishing here, I am not going to be called a pesky\nfool with impunity, unless you do it over my dead body.” He stopped about\nten rods away and I became more fearless. “I don’t know who you are,” said\nI, as I took off my coat and vest and piled them up on my fish basket,\neager for the fray. “You claim to own this farm, but it is my opinion that\nyou are the hired man, puffed up with a little authority. You can’t order\nme off this ground till you show me a duly certified abstract of title and\nthen identify yourself. What protection does a gentleman have if he is to\nbe kicked and cuffed about by Tom, Dick and Harry, claiming they own the\nwhole State. Get out! Avaunt! If you don’t avaunt pretty quick I’ll scrap\nyou and sell you to a medical college.”",
        "He stood in dumb amazement a moment, then he said he would go and get his\ndeed and his shotgun. I said shotguns suited me exactly, and I told him to\nbring two of them loaded with giant powder and barbed wire. I would not\nlive alway. I asked not to stay. When he got behind the corn-crib I\nclimbed the fence and fled with my ill-gotten gains.",
        "The blacksmith in his prime may lick the small boy, but twenty years\nchanges their relative positions. Possibly Tidd could tear up the ground\nwith me now, but in ten more years, if I improve as fast as he fails, I\nshall fish in that same old stream again.",
        "Letter From New York.",
        "Dear friend.–Being Sunday, I take an hour to write you a letter in regard\nto this place. I came here yesterday without attracting undue attention\nfrom people who lived here. If they was surprised, they concealed it from\nme.",
        "I’ve camped out on the Chug years ago, and went to sleep with no live\nthing near me except my own pony, and woke up with the early song of the\ncoyote, and have been on the lonesome plain for days where it seemed to me\nthat a hostile would be mighty welcome if he would only say something to\nme, but I was never so lonesome as I was here in this big town last night,\nalthough it is the most thick settled place I was ever at.",
        "I was so kind of low and depressed that I strolled in to the bar at last,\nallowing that I could pound on the counter and call up the boys and get\nacquainted a little with somebody, just as I would at Col. Luke Murrin’s,\nat Cheyenne; but when I waved to the other parties, and told them to rally\nround the foaming beaker, they apologized, and allowed they had just been\nto dinner.",
        "Just been to dinner, and there it was pretty blamed near dark! Then I\nasked ’em to take a cigar, but they mostly cackillated they had no\noccasion.",
        "I was mad, but what could I do? They was too many for me, and I couldn’t\ncoerce the white livered aristocratic mob, for quicker’n scat they could\nhave hollored into a little cupboard they had there in the corner, and in\nless’n two minits they’d of had the whole police department and the hook\nand ladder company down there after me with a torch-light procession.",
        "So I swallowed my wrath and a tame drink of cultivated whiskey with Apollo\nBelvidere on the side, and went out into the auditorium of the hotel.",
        "Here I was very unhappy, being, as the editor of the Green River Gazette\nwould say, “the cynosure of all eyes.”",
        "I would rather not be a cynosure, even at a good salary; so I thought I\nwould ask the proprietor to build a fire in my room. I went up to the\nrecorder’s office, where the big hotel autograft album is, and asked to\nsee the proprietor.",
        "A good-looking young man came forward and asked me what he could do for\nme. I said if it wouldn’t be too much trouble, I wisht he would build a\nlittle fire in my room, and I would pay him for it; or, if he would show\nme where the woodpile was, I would build the fire myself–I wasn’t doing\nanything special at that time.",
        "He then whistled through his teeth and crooked his finger in a shrill tone\nof voice to a young party who was working for him, and told him to “build\na fire in four-ought-two.”",
        "I then sat down in the auditorium and read out of a railroad tract, which\nundertook to show that a party that undertook to ride over a rival road,\nmust do so because life was a burden to him, and facility, and comfort,\nand safety, and such things no object whatever. But still I was very\nlonely, and felt as if I was far, far away from home.",
        "I couldn’t have been more uncomfortable if I’d been a young man I saw\ntwenty-five years ago on the old overland trail. He had gone out to study\nthe Indian character, and to win said Indian to the fold. When I next saw\nhim he was twenty miles farther on. He had been thrown in contact with\nsaid Indian in the meantime. I judged he had been making a collection of\nIndian arrows. He was extremely no more. He looked some like Saint\nSebastian, and some like a toothpick-holder.",
        "I was never successfully lost on the plains, and so I started out after\nsupper to find my room. I found a good many other rooms, and tried to get\ninto them, but I did not find four-ought-two till a late hour; then I\nsubsidized the night patrol on the third floor to assist me.",
        "This is a nice place to stop, but it is a little too rich for my blood, I\nguess Not so much as regards price, but I can see that I am beginning to\nexcite curiosity among the boarders. People are coming here to board just\nbecause I am here, and it is disagreeable. I do not court notoriety. I\nhave always lived in a plain way, and I would give a dollar if people\nwould look the other way while I eat my pie.",
        "Yours truly,",
        "E.O.D.",
        "To E. Wm. Nye, Esq.",
        "P.S.–This is not a dictated letter. I left my stenograffer and revolver\nat Pumpkin Buttes.",
