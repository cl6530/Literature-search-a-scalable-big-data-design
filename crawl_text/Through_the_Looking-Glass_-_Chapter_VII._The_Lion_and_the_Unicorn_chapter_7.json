        "\n\n",
        "  The next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first\nin twos and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in\nsuch crowds that they seemed to fill the whole forest.  Alice got\nbehind a tree, for fear of being run over, and watched them go by.",
        "  She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so\nuncertain on their feet:  they were always tripping over\nsomething or other, and whenever one went down, several more\nalways fell over him, so that the ground was soon covered with\nlittle heaps of men.",
        "  Then came the horses.  Having four feet, these managed rather\nbetter than the foot-soldiers:  but even THEY stumbled now and\nthen; and it seemed to be a regular rule that, whenever a horse\nstumbled the rider fell off instantly.  The confusion got worse\nevery moment, and Alice was very glad to get out of the wood into\nan open place, where she found the White King seated on the\nground, busily writing in his memorandum-book.",
        "  ’I’ve sent them all!’ the King cried in a tone of delight, on\nseeing Alice.  ’Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as\nyou came through the wood?’",
        "  ’Yes, I did,’ said Alice:  ’several thousand, I should think.’",
        "  ’Four thousand two hundred and seven, that’s the exact number,’\nthe King said, referring to his book.  ’I couldn’t send all the\nhorses, you know, because two of them are wanted in the game.\nAnd I haven’t sent the two Messengers, either.  They’re both gone\nto the town.  Just look along the road, and tell me if you can\nsee either of them.’",
        "  ’I see nobody on the road,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’I only wish I had such eyes,’ the King remarked in a fretful\ntone.  ’To be able to see Nobody!  And at that distance, too!\nWhy, it’s as much as I can do to see real people, by this\nlight!’",
        "  All this was lost on Alice, who was still looking intently\nalong the road, shading her eyes with one hand.  ’I see somebody\nnow!’ she exclaimed at last.  ’But he’s coming very slowly–and\nwhat curious attitudes he goes into!’  (For the messenger kept\nskipping up and down, and wriggling like an eel, as he came\nalong, with his great hands spread out like fans on each side.)",
        "  ’Not at all,’ said the King.  ’He’s an Anglo-Saxon Messenger–\nand those are Anglo-Saxon attitudes.  He only does them when\nhe’s happy.  His name is Haigha.’  (He pronounced it so as to\nrhyme with ’mayor.’)",
        "’I love my love with an H,’ Alice couldn’t help beginning,\n’because he is Happy.  I hate him with an H, because he is\nHideous. I fed him with–with–with Ham-sandwiches and Hay.\nHis name is Haigha, and he lives–’",
        "  ’He lives on the Hill,’ the King remarked simply, without the\nleast idea that he was joining in the game, while Alice was still\nhesitating for the name of a town beginning with H.  ’The other\nMessenger’s called Hatta.  I must have TWO, you know–to come\nand go.  One to come, and one to go.’",
        "  ’I beg your pardon?’ said Alice.",
        "  ’It isn’t respectable to beg,’ said the King.",
        "  ’I only meant that I didn’t understand,’ said Alice.  ’Why one\nto come and one to go?’",
        "  ’Didn’t I tell you?’ the King repeated impatiently.  ’I must\nhave Two–to fetch and carry.  One to fetch, and one to carry.’",
        "  At this moment the Messenger arrived:  he was far too much out\nof breath to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and\nmake the most fearful faces at the poor King.",
        "  ’This young lady loves you with an H,’ the King said,\nintroducing Alice in the hope of turning off the Messenger’s\nattention from himself–but it was no use–the Anglo-Saxon\nattitudes only got more extraordinary every moment, while the\ngreat eyes rolled wildly from side to side.",
        "  ’You alarm me!’ said the King.  ’I feel faint–Give me a ham\nsandwich!’",
        "  On which the Messenger, to Alice’s great amusement, opened a\nbag that hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the King,\nwho devoured it greedily.",
        "  ’Another sandwich!’ said the King.",
        "  ’There’s nothing but hay left now,’ the Messenger said, peeping\ninto the bag.",
        "  ’Hay, then,’ the King murmured in a faint whisper.",
        "  Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal.\n’There’s nothing like eating hay when you’re faint,’ he remarked\nto her, as he munched away.",
        "  ’I should think throwing cold water over you would be better,’\nAlice suggested:  ’or some sal-volatile.’",
        "  ’I didn’t say there was nothing BETTER,’ the King replied.  ’I said\nthere was nothing LIKE it.’  Which Alice did not venture to deny.",
        "  ’Who did you pass on the road?’ the King went on, holding out\nhis hand to the Messenger for some more hay.",
        "  ’Nobody,’ said the Messenger.",
        "  ’Quite right,’ said the King:  ’this young lady saw him too.\nSo of course Nobody walks slower than you.’",
        "  ’I do my best,’ the Messenger said in a sulky tone.  ’I’m sure\nnobody walks much faster than I do!’",
        "  ’He can’t do that,’ said the King, ’or else he’d have been here\nfirst.  However, now you’ve got your breath, you may tell us\nwhat’s happened in the town.’",
        "  ’I’ll whisper it,’ said the Messenger, putting his hands to his\nmouth in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close\nto the King’s ear.  Alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to\nhear the news too.  However, instead of whispering, he simply\nshouted at the top of his voice ’They’re at it again!’",
        "  ’Do you call THAT a whisper?’ cried the poor King, jumping up\nand shaking himself.  ’If you do such a thing again, I’ll have\nyou buttered!  It went through and through my head like an\nearthquake!’",
        "  ’It would have to be a very tiny earthquake!’ thought Alice.\n’Who are at it again?’ she ventured to ask.",
        "  ’Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,’ said the King.",
        "  ’Fighting for the crown?’",
        "  ’Yes, to be sure,’ said the King:  ’and the best of the joke\nis, that it’s MY crown all the while!  Let’s run and see them.’\nAnd they trotted off, Alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the\nwords of the old song:–",
        "    ’The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown:\n    The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town.\n    Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown;\n    Some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.’",
        "  ’Does–the one–that wins–get the crown?’ she asked, as\nwell as she could, for the run was putting her quite out of\nbreath.",
        "  ’Dear me, no!’ said the King.  ’What an idea!’",
        "  ’Would you–be good enough,’ Alice panted out, after running\na little further, ’to stop a minute–just to get–one’s\nbreath again?’",
        "  ’I’m GOOD enough,’ the King said, ’only I’m not strong enough.\nYou see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick.  You might as well\ntry to stop a Bandersnatch!’",
        "  Alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in\nsilence, till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle\nof which the Lion and Unicorn were fighting.  They were in such a\ncloud of dust, that at first Alice could not make out which was\nwhich:  but she soon managed to distinguish the Unicorn by his\nhorn.",
        "  They placed themselves close to where Hatta, the other\nmessenger, was standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in\none hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.",
        "  ’He’s only just out of prison, and he hadn’t finished his tea\nwhen he was sent in,’ Haigha whispered to Alice:  ’and they only\ngive them oyster-shells in there–so you see he’s very hungry\nand thirsty.  How are you, dear child?’ he went on, putting his\narm affectionately round Hatta’s neck.",
        "  Hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and\nbutter.",
        "  ’Were you happy in prison, dear child?’ said Haigha.",
        "  Hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two\ntrickled down his cheek:  but not a word would he say.",
        "  ’Speak, can’t you!’ Haigha cried impatiently.  But Hatta only\nmunched away, and drank some more tea.",
        "  ’Speak, won’t you!’ cried the King.  ’How are they getting on\nwith the fight?’",
        "  Hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of\nbread-and-butter.  ’They’re getting on very well,’ he said in a\nchoking voice:  ’each of them has been down about eighty-seven\ntimes.’",
        "  ’Then I suppose they’ll soon bring the white bread and the\nbrown?’ Alice ventured to remark.",
        "  ’It’s waiting for ’em now,’ said Hatta:  ’this is a bit of it\nas I’m eating.’",
        "  There was a pause in the fight just then, and the Lion and the\nUnicorn sat down, panting, while the King called out ’Ten minutes\nallowed for refreshments!’  Haigha and Hatta set to work at once,\ncarrying rough trays of white and brown bread.  Alice took a\npiece to taste, but it was VERY dry.",
        "  ’I don’t think they’ll fight any more to-day,’ the King said to\nHatta:  ’go and order the drums to begin.’  And Hatta went\nbounding away like a grasshopper.",
        "  For a minute or two Alice stood silent, watching him.  Suddenly\nshe brightened up.  ’Look, look!’ she cried, pointing eagerly.\n’There’s the White Queen running across the country!  She came\nflying out of the wood over yonder–How fast those Queens CAN\nrun!’",
        "  ’There’s some enemy after her, no doubt,’ the King said,\nwithout even looking round.  ’That wood’s full of them.’",
        "  ’But aren’t you going to run and help her?’ Alice asked, very\nmuch surprised at his taking it so quietly.",
        "  ’No use, no use!’ said the King.  ’She runs so fearfully quick.\nYou might as well try to catch a Bandersnatch!  But I’ll make a\nmemorandum about her, if you like–She’s a dear good creature,’\nhe repeated softly to himself, as he opened his memorandum-book.\n’Do you spell “creature” with a double “e”?’",
        "  At this moment the Unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in\nhis pockets.  ’I had the best of it this time?’ he said to the\nKing, just glancing at him as he passed.",
        "  ’A little–a little,’ the King replied, rather nervously.\n’You shouldn’t have run him through with your horn, you know.’",
        "  ’It didn’t hurt him,’ the Unicorn said carelessly, and he was\ngoing on, when his eye happened to fall upon Alice:  he turned\nround rather instantly, and stood for some time looking at her\nwith an air of the deepest disgust.",
        "  ’What–is–this?’ he said at last.",
        "  ’This is a child!’ Haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of\nAlice to introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards\nher in an Anglo-Saxon attitude.  ’We only found it to-day.  It’s\nas large as life, and twice as natural!’",
        "  ’I always thought they were fabulous monsters!’  said the\nUnicorn.  ’Is it alive?’",
        "  ’It can talk,’ said Haigha, solemnly.",
        "  The Unicorn looked dreamily at Alice, and said ’Talk, child.’",
        "  Alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began:\n’Do you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too!\nI never saw one alive before!’",
        "  ’Well, now that we HAVE seen each other,’ said the Unicorn,\n’if you’ll believe in me, I’ll believe in you.  Is that a bargain?’",
        "  ’Yes, if you like,’ said Alice.",
        "  ’Come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man!’ the Unicorn went on,\nturning from her to the King.  ’None of your brown bread for me!’",
        "  ’Certainly–certainly!’ the King muttered, and beckoned to\nHaigha.  ’Open the bag!’ he whispered.  ’Quick!  Not that one–\nthat’s full of hay!’",
        "  Haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to Alice\nto hold, while he got out a dish and carving-knife.  How they all\ncame out of it Alice couldn’t guess.  It was just like a\nconjuring-trick, she thought.",
        "  The Lion had joined them while this was going on:  he looked\nvery tired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut.  ’What’s\nthis!’ he said, blinking lazily at Alice, and speaking in a deep\nhollow tone that sounded like the tolling of a great bell.",
        "  ’Ah, what IS it, now?’ the Unicorn cried eagerly.  ’You’ll\nnever guess!  I couldn’t.’",
        "  The Lion looked at Alice wearily.  ’Are you animal–vegetable\n–or mineral?’ he said, yawning at every other word.",
        "  ’It’s a fabulous monster!’ the Unicorn cried out, before Alice\ncould reply.",
        "  ’Then hand round the plum-cake, Monster,’ the Lion said, lying\ndown and putting his chin on this paws.  ’And sit down, both of\nyou,’ (to the King and the Unicorn):  ’fair play with the cake,\nyou know!’",
        "  The King was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down\nbetween the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him.",
        "  ’What a fight we might have for the crown, NOW!’ the Unicorn\nsaid, looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor King was\nnearly shaking off his head, he trembled so much.",
        "  ’I should win easy,’ said the Lion.",
        "  ’I’m not so sure of that,’ said the Unicorn.",
        "  ’Why, I beat you all round the town, you chicken!’ the Lion\nreplied angrily, half getting up as he spoke.",
        "  Here the King interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on:  he\nwas very nervous, and his voice quite quivered.  ’All round the\ntown?’ he said.  ’That’s a good long way.  Did you go by the old\nbridge, or the market-place?  You get the best view by the old\nbridge.’",
        "  ’I’m sure I don’t know,’ the Lion growled out as he lay down\nagain.  ’There was too much dust to see anything.  What a time\nthe Monster is, cutting up that cake!’",
        "  Alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with\nthe great dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with\nthe knife.  ’It’s very provoking!’ she said, in reply to the Lion\n(she was getting quite used to being called ’the Monster’).\n’I’ve cut several slices already, but they always join on again!’",
        "  ’You don’t know how to manage Looking-glass cakes,’ the Unicorn\nremarked.  ’Hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.’",
        "  This sounded nonsense, but Alice very obediently got up, and\ncarried the dish round, and the cake divided itself into three\npieces as she did so.  ’NOW cut it up,’ said the Lion, as she\nreturned to her place with the empty dish.",
        "  ’I say, this isn’t fair!’ cried the Unicorn, as Alice sat with\nthe knife in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin.  ’The\nMonster has given the Lion twice as much as me!’",
        "  ’She’s kept none for herself, anyhow,’ said the Lion.  ’Do you\nlike plum-cake, Monster?’",
        "  But before Alice could answer him, the drums began.",
        "  Where the noise came from, she couldn’t make out:  the air\nseemed full of it, and it rang through and through her head till\nshe felt quite deafened.  She started to her feet and sprang\nacross the little brook in her terror,",
        "and had just time to see the Lion and the Unicorn rise to their\nfeet, with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast,\nbefore she dropped to her knees, and put her hands over her ears,\nvainly trying to shut out the dreadful uproar.",
        "  ’If THAT doesn’t “drum them out of town,\"’ she thought to\nherself, ’nothing ever will!’",
