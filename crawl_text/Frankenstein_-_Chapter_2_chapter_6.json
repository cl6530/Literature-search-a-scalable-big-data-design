        "We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\nour ages.  I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\ndisunion or dispute.  Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\nnearer together.  Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home\n–the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\nour Alpine summers–she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\ncauses.  The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\nearliest sensations I can remember.",
        "On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\ncountry.  We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive,\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\nleague from the city.  We resided principally in the latter, and the\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.  It was my\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.  I was\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.  Henry\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.  He was a boy of singular\ntalent and fancy.  He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\nits own sake.  He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.  He\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\nknightly adventure.  He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\nof the infidels.",
        "No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.  My\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.\nWe felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to\ntheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\nwhich we enjoyed.  When I mingled with other families I distinctly\ndiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted\nthe development of filial love.",
        "My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\nlaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\nindiscriminately.  I confess that neither the structure of languages,\nnor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\npossessed attractions for me.  It was the secrets of heaven and earth\nthat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\nthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\nthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\nor in it highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.",
        "Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\nrelations of things.  The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was\nto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.  The saintly soul\nof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.\nHer sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of\nher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.  She was\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become\nsullen in my study, through the ardour of my nature, but that she was\nthere to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.  And\nClerval–could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?  Yet\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\ngenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\nbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\nambition.",
        "I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of\nchildhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright\nvisions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon\nself.  Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record\nthose events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of\nmisery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that\npassion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a\nmountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but,\nswelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course,\nhas swept away all my hopes and joys.  Natural philosophy is the genius\nthat has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to\nstate those facts which led to my predilection for that science.  When\nI was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the\nbaths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a\nday confined to the inn.  In this house I chanced to find a volume of\nthe works of Cornelius Agrippa.  I opened it with apathy; the theory\nwhich he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he\nrelates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.  A new light seemed\nto dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\ndiscovery to my father.  My father looked carelessly at the title page\nof my book and said, “Ah!  Cornelius Agrippa!  My dear Victor, do not\nwaste your time upon this; it is sad trash.”",
        "If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to\nme that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a\nmodern system of science had been introduced which possessed much\ngreater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were\nchimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under\nsuch circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and\nhave contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with\ngreater ardour to my former studies.  It is even possible that the\ntrain of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led\nto my ruin.  But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by\nno means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I\ncontinued to read with the greatest avidity.  When I returned home my\nfirst care was to procure the whole works of this author, and\nafterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.  I read and studied the\nwild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me\ntreasures known to few besides myself.  I have described myself as\nalways having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the\nsecrets of nature.  In spite of the intense labour and wonderful\ndiscoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies\ndiscontented and unsatisfied.  Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed\nthat he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and\nunexplored ocean of truth.  Those of his successors in each branch of\nnatural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy’s\napprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.",
        "The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted\nwith their practical uses.  The most learned philosopher knew little\nmore.  He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal\nlineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.  He might dissect,\nanatomize, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\nin their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.  I\nhad gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep\nhuman beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and\nignorantly I had repined.",
        "But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and\nknew more.  I took their word for all that they averred, and I became\ntheir disciple.  It may appear strange that such should arise in the\neighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in\nthe schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with\nregard to my favourite studies.  My father was not scientific, and I\nwas left to struggle with a child’s blindness, added to a student’s\nthirst for knowledge.  Under the guidance of my new preceptors I\nentered with the greatest diligence into the search of the\nphilosopher’s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon\nobtained my undivided attention.  Wealth was an inferior object, but\nwhat glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from\nthe human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent\ndeath!  Nor were these my only visions.  The raising of ghosts or\ndevils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the\nfulfillment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were\nalways unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own\ninexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my\ninstructors.  And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems,\nmingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and\nfloundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge,\nguided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an\naccident again changed the current of my ideas.  When I was about\nfifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we\nwitnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm.  It advanced from\nbehind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with\nfrightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.  I remained,\nwhile the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and\ndelight.  As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire\nissue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from\nour house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had\ndisappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump.  When we visited\nit the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.\nIt was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin\nribbons of wood.  I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.",
        "Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of\nelectricity.  On this occasion a man of great research in natural\nphilosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on\nthe explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of\nelectricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to\nme.  All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,\nAlbertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by\nsome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my\naccustomed studies.  It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever\nbe known.  All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew\ndespicable.  By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps\nmost subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former\noccupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed\nand abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a\nwould-be science which could never even step within the threshold of\nreal knowledge.  In this mood of mind I betook myself to the\nmathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as\nbeing built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.",
        "Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments\nare we bound to prosperity or ruin.  When I look back, it seems to me\nas if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the\nimmediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life–the last effort\nmade by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even\nthen hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.  Her victory was\nannounced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which\nfollowed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting\nstudies.  It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with\ntheir prosecution, happiness with their disregard.",
        "It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.\nDestiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and\nterrible destruction.",
