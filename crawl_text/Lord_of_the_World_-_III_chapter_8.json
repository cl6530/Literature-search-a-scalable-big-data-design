        "There was great talk that night at dinner among the priests as to the\nextraordinary spread of Freemasonry. It had been going on for many years\nnow, and Catholics perfectly recognised its dangers, for the profession\nof Masonry had been for some centuries rendered incompatible with\nreligion through the Church’s unswerving condemnation of it. A man must\nchoose between that and his faith. Things had developed extraordinarily\nduring the last century. First there had been the organised assault upon\nthe Church in France; and what Catholics had always suspected then\nbecame a certainty in the revelations of 1918, when P. Gerome, the\nDominican and ex-Mason, had made his disclosures with regard to the\nMark-Masons. It had become evident then that Catholics had been right,\nand that Masonry, in its higher grades at least, had been responsible\nthroughout the world for the strange movement against religion. But he\nhad died in his bed, and the public had been impressed by that fact.\nThen came the splendid donations in France and Italy–to hospitals,\norphanages, and the like; and once more suspicion began to disappear.\nAfter all, it seemed–and continued to seem–for seventy years and more\nthat Masonry was nothing more than a vast philanthropical society. Now\nonce more men had their doubts.",
        "“I hear that Felsenburgh is a Mason,” observed Monsignor Macintosh, the\nCathedral Administrator. “A Grand-Master or something.”",
        "“But who is Felsenburgh?” put in a young priest.",
        "Monsignor pursed his lips and shook his head. He was one of those humble\npersons as proud of ignorance as others of knowledge. He boasted that he\nnever read the papers nor any book except those that had received the\nimprimatur; it was a priest’s business, he often remarked, to preserve\nthe faith, not to acquire worldly knowledge. Percy had occasionally\nrather envied his point of view.",
        "“He’s a mystery,” said another priest, Father Blackmore; “but he seems\nto be causing great excitement. They were selling his ’Life’ to-day on\nthe Embankment.”",
        "“I met an American senator,” put in Percy, “three days ago, who told me\nthat even there they know nothing of him, except his extraordinary\neloquence. He only appeared last year, and seems to have carried\neverything before him by quite unusual methods. He is a great linguist,\ntoo. That is why they took him to Irkutsk.”",
        "“Well, the Masons–-” went on Monsignor. “It is very serious. In the\nlast month four of my penitents have left me because of it.”",
        "“Their inclusion of women was their master-stroke,” growled Father\nBlackmore, helping himself to claret.",
        "“It is extraordinary that they hesitated so long about that,” observed\nPercy.",
        "A couple of the others added their evidence. It appeared that they, too,\nhad lost penitents lately through the spread of Masonry. It was rumoured\nthat a Pastoral was a-preparing upstairs on the subject.",
        "Monsignor shook his head ominously.",
        "“More is wanted than that,” he said.",
        "Percy pointed out that the Church had said her last word several\ncenturies ago. She had laid her excommunication on all members of secret\nsocieties, and there was really no more that she could do.",
        "“Except bring it before her children again and again,” put in Monsignor.\n“I shall preach on it next Sunday.”",
        "Percy dotted down a note when he reached his room, determining to say\nanother word or two on the subject to the Cardinal-Protector. He had\nmentioned Freemasonry often before, but it seemed time for another\nremark. Then he opened his letters, first turning to one which he\nrecognised as from the Cardinal.",
        "It seemed a curious coincidence, as he read a series of questions that\nCardinal Martin’s letter contained, that one of them should be on this\nvery subject. It ran as follows:",
        "“What of Masonry? Felsenburgh is said to be one. Gather all the gossip\nyou can about him. Send any English or American biographies of him. Are\nyou still losing Catholics through Masonry?”",
        "He ran his eyes down the rest of the questions. They chiefly referred to\nprevious remarks of his own, but twice, even in them, Felsenburgh’s name\nappeared.",
        "He laid the paper down and considered a little.",
        "It was very curious, he thought, how this man’s name was in every one’s\nmouth, in spite of the fact that so little was known about him. He had\nbought in the streets, out of curiosity, three photographs that\nprofessed to represent this strange person, and though one of them might\nbe genuine they all three could not be. He drew them out of a\npigeon-hole, and spread them before him.",
        "One represented a fierce, bearded creature like a Cossack, with round\nstaring eyes. No; intrinsic evidence condemned this: it was exactly how\na coarse imagination would have pictured a man who seemed to be having a\ngreat influence in the East.",
        "The second showed a fat face with little eyes and a chin-beard. That\nmight conceivably be genuine: he turned it over and saw the name of a\nNew York firm on the back. Then he turned to the third. This presented a\nlong, clean-shaven face with pince-nez, undeniably clever, but scarcely\nstrong: and Felsenburgh was obviously a strong man.",
        "Percy inclined to think the second was the most probable; but they were\nall unconvincing; and he shuffled them carelessly together and replaced\nthem.",
        "Then he put his elbows on the table, and began to think.",
        "He tried to remember what Mr. Varhaus, the American senator, had told\nhim of Felsenburgh; yet it did not seem sufficient to account for the\nfacts. Felsenburgh, it seemed, had employed none of those methods common\nin modern politics. He controlled no newspapers, vituperated nobody,\nchampioned nobody: he had no picked underlings; he used no bribes; there\nwere no monstrous crimes alleged against him. It seemed rather as if his\noriginality lay in his clean hands and his stainless past–that, and his\nmagnetic character. He was the kind of figure that belonged rather to\nthe age of chivalry: a pure, clean, compelling personality, like a\nradiant child. He had taken people by surprise, then, rising out of the\nheaving dun-coloured waters of American socialism like a vision–from\nthose waters so fiercely restrained from breaking into storm over since\nthe extraordinary social revolution under Mr. Hearst’s disciples, a\ncentury ago. That had been the end of plutocracy; the famous old laws of\n1914 had burst some of the stinking bubbles of the time; and the\nenactments of 1916 and 1917 had prevented their forming again in any\nthing like their previous force. It had been the salvation of America,\nundoubtedly, even if that salvation were of a dreary and uninspiring\ndescription; and now out of the flat socialistic level had arisen this\nromantic figure utterly unlike any that had preceded it.... So the\nsenator had hinted.... It was too complicated for Percy just now, and he\ngave it up.",
        "It was a weary world, he told himself, turning his eyes homewards.\nEverything seemed so hopeless and ineffective. He tried not to reflect\non his fellow-priests, but for the fiftieth time he could not help\nseeing that they were not the men for the present situation. It was not\nthat he preferred himself; he knew perfectly well that he, too, was\nfully as incompetent: had he not proved to be so with poor Father\nFrancis, and scores of others who had clutched at him in their agony\nduring the last ten years? Even the Archbishop, holy man as he was, with\nall his childlike faith–was that the man to lead English Catholics and\nconfound their enemies? There seemed no giants on the earth in these\ndays. What in the world was to be done? He buried his face in his\nhands....",
        "Yes; what was wanted was a new Order in the Church; the old ones were\nrule-bound through no fault of their own. An Order was wanted without\nhabit or tonsure, without traditions or customs, an Order with nothing\nbut entire and whole-hearted devotion, without pride even in their most\nsacred privileges, without a past history in which they might take\ncomplacent refuge. They must be franc-tireurs of Christ’s Army; like\nthe Jesuits, but without their fatal reputation, which, again, was no\nfault of their own. ... But there must be a Founder–Who, in God’s Name?\n–a Founder nudus sequens Christum nudum.... Yes–Franc-tireurs–priests, bishops, laymen and women–with the three vows of course, and\na special clause forbidding utterly and for ever their ownership of\ncorporate wealth.–Every gift received must be handed to the bishop of\nthe diocese in which it was given, who must provide them himself with\nnecessaries of life and travel. Oh!–what could they not do?... He was\noff in a rhapsody.",
        "Presently he recovered, and called himself a fool. Was not that scheme\nas old as the eternal hills, and as useless for practical purposes? Why,\nit had been the dream of every zealous man since the First Year of\nSalvation that such an Order should be founded!... He was a fool....",
        "Then once more he began to think of it all over again.",
        "Surely it was this which was wanted against the Masons; and women,\ntoo.–Had not scheme after scheme broken down because men had forgotten\nthe power of women? It was that lack that had ruined Napoleon: he had\ntrusted Josephine, and she had failed him; so he had trusted no other\nwoman. In the Catholic Church, too, woman had been given no active work\nbut either menial or connected with education: and was there not room\nfor other activities than those? Well, it was useless to think of it. It\nwas not his affair. If Papa Angelicus who now reigned in Rome had not\nthought of it, why should a foolish, conceited priest in Westminster set\nhimself up to do so?",
        "So he beat himself on the breast once more, and took up his office-book.",
        "He finished in half an hour, and again sat thinking; but this time it\nwas of poor Father Francis. He wondered what he was doing now; whether\nhe had taken off the Roman collar of Christ’s familiar slaves? The poor\ndevil! And how far was he, Percy Franklin, responsible?",
        "When a tap came at his door presently, and Father Blackmore looked in\nfor a talk before going to bed, Percy told him what had happened.",
        "Father Blackmore removed his pipe and sighed deliberately.",
        "“I knew it was coming,” he said. “Well, well.”",
        "“He has been honest enough,” explained Percy. “He told me eight months\nago he was in trouble.”",
        "Father Blackmore drew upon his pipe thoughtfully.",
        "“Father Franklin,” he said, “things are really very serious. There is\nthe same story everywhere. What in the world is happening?”",
        "Percy paused before answering.",
        "“I think these things go in waves,” he said.",
        "“Waves, do you think?” said the other.",
        "“What else?”",
        "Father Blackmore looked at him intently.",
        "“It is more like a dead calm, it seems to me,” he said. “Have you ever\nbeen in a typhoon?”",
        "Percy shook his head.",
        "“Well,” went on the other, “the most ominous thing is the calm. The sea\nis like oil; you feel half-dead: you can do nothing. Then comes the\nstorm.”",
        "Percy looked at him, interested. He had not seen this mood in the priest\nbefore.",
        "“Before every great crash there comes this calm. It is always so in\nhistory. It was so before the Eastern War; it was so before the French\nRevolution. It was so before the Reformation. There is a kind of oily\nheaving; and everything is languid. So everything has been in America,\ntoo, for over eighty years.... Father Franklin, I think something is\ngoing to happen.”",
        "“Tell me,” said Percy, leaning forward.",
        "“Well, I saw Templeton a week before he died, and he put the idea in my\nhead.... Look here, father. It may be this Eastern affair that is coming\non us; but somehow I don’t think it is. It is in religion that something\nis going to happen. At least, so I think.... Father, who in God’s name\nis Felsenburgh?”",
        "Percy was so startled at the sudden introduction of this name again,\nthat he stared a moment without speaking.",
        "Outside, the summer night was very still. There was a faint vibration\nnow and again from the underground track that ran twenty yards from the\nhouse where they sat; but the streets were quiet enough round the\nCathedral. Once a hoot rang far away, as if some ominous bird of passage\nwere crossing between London and the stars, and once the cry of a woman\nsounded thin and shrill from the direction of the river. For the rest\nthere was no more than the solemn, subdued hum that never ceased now\nnight or day.",
        "“Yes; Felsenburgh,” said Father Blackmore once more. “I cannot get that\nman out of my head. And yet, what do I know of him? What does any one\nknow of him?”",
        "Percy licked his lips to answer, and drew a breath to still the beating\nof his heart. He could not imagine why he felt excited. After all, who\nwas old Blackmore to frighten him? But old Blackmore went on before he\ncould speak.",
        "“See how people are leaving the Church! The Wargraves, the Hendersons,\nSir James Bartlet, Lady Magnier, and then all the priests. Now they’re\nnot all knaves–I wish they were; it would be so much easier to talk of\nit. But Sir James Bartlet, last month! Now, there’s a man who has spent\nhalf his fortune on the Church, and he doesn’t resent it even now. He\nsays that any religion is better than none, but that, for himself, he\njust can’t believe any longer. Now what does all that mean?... I tell\nyou something is going to happen. God knows what! And I can’t get\nFelsenburgh out of my head.... Father Franklin–-”",
        "“Yes?”",
        "“Have you noticed how few great men we’ve got? It’s not like fifty years\nago, or even thirty. Then there were Mason, Selborne, Sherbrook, and\nhalf-a-dozen others. There was Brightman, too, as Archbishop: and now!\nThen the Communists, too. Braithwaite is dead fifteen years. Certainly\nhe was big enough; but he was always speaking of the future, not of the\npresent; and tell me what big man they have had since then! And now\nthere’s this new man, whom no one knows, who came forward in America a\nfew months ago, and whose name is in every one’s mouth. Very well,\nthen!”",
        "Percy knitted his forehead.",
        "“I am not sure that I understand,” he said.",
        "Father Blackmore knocked his pipe out before answering.",
        "“Well, this,” he said, standing up. “I can’t help thinking Felsenburgh\nis going to do something. I don’t know what; it may be for us or against\nus. But he is a Mason, remember that.... Well, well; I dare say I’m an\nold fool. Good-night.”",
        "“One moment, father,” said Percy slowly. “Do you mean–? Good Lord! What\ndo you mean?” He stopped, looking at the other.",
        "The old priest stared back under his bushy eyebrows; it seemed to Percy\nas if he, too, were afraid of something in spite of his easy talk; but\nhe made no sign.",
        "Percy stood perfectly still a moment when the door was shut. Then he\nmoved across to his prie-dieu.",
