        "Eight specialists, including Romney, of New York and Saltonstal, of\nChicago, had given Charles Whitney their verdicts on why he was weak and\nlethargic. In essential details these diagnoses differed as widely as\nopinions always differ where no one knows, or can know, and so everyone\nis free to please his own fancy in choosing a cloak for his ignorance.\nSome of the doctors declared kidneys sound but liver suspicious; others\nexonerated liver but condemned one or both kidneys; others viewed kidneys\nand liver with equal pessimism; still others put those organs aside and\nshook their heads and unlimbered their Latin at spleen and pancreas. In\none respect, however, the eight narrowed to two groups. “Let’s figure it\nout trial-balance fashion,” said Whitney to his private secretary, Vagen.\n“Five, including two-thousand-dollar Romney, say I ’may go soon.’ Three,\nincluding our one-thousand-dollar neighbor, Saltonstal, say I am ’in no\nimmediate danger.’ But what the Romneys mean by ’soon,’ and what the\nSaltonstals mean by ’immediate,’ none of the eight says.”",
        "“But they all say that ’with proper care’–” began Vagen, with the faith\nof the little in the pretentious.",
        "“So they do! So they do!” interrupted Whitney, whom life had taught not\nto measure wisdom by profession of it, nor yet by repute for it. And he\nwent on in a drowsy drawl, significantly different from his wonted rather\nexplosive method of speech: “But does any of ’em say what ’proper care’\nis? Each gives his opinion. Eight opinions, each different and each\ncautioning me against the kind of ’care’ prescribed by the other seven.\nAnd I paid six thousand dollars!” A cynical smile played round his\nthin-lipped, sensual, selfish mouth.",
        "“Sixty-three hundred,” corrected Vagen. He never missed this sort of\nchance to impress his master with his passion for accuracy.",
        "“Sixty-three, then. I’d better have given you the money to blow in on\nyour fliers on wheat and pork.”",
        "At this Vagen looked much depressed. It was his first intimation that his\nchief knew about his private life. “I hope, sir, nobody has been\npoisoning your mind against me,” said he. “I court the fullest\ninvestigation. I have been honest–”",
        "“Of course, of course,” replied Whitney. “There never was a man as timid\nas you are that wasn’t honest. What a shallow world it is! How often envy\nand cowardice pass for virtue!”",
        "“I often say, sir,” replied Vagen, with intent to soothe and flatter,\n“there ain’t one man in ten million that wouldn’t have done the things\nyou’ve done if they’d had the brains and the nerve.”",
        "“And pray what are the ’things I’ve done’?” inquired Whitney. But the\nflame of irritation was so feeble that it died down before his words were\nout. “I’m going down to Saint X to see old Schulze,” he drawled on.\n“Schulze knows more than any of ’em–and ain’t afraid to say when he\ndon’t know.” A slow, somewhat sardonic smile. “That’s why he’s unknown.\nWhat can a wise man, who insists on showing that he’s wise, expect in a\nworld of damn fools?” A long silence during which the uncomfortable Vagen\nhad the consolation of seeing in that haggard, baggy, pasty-white face\nthat his master’s thoughts were serving him much worse than mere\ndiscomfort. Then Whitney spoke again: “Yes, I’m going to Saint X. I’m\ngoing home to–”",
        "He did not finish; he could not speak the word of finality. Vagen saw the\nlook in his pale, blue-green eyes, saw that the great financier knew he\nwould never again fling his terrible nets broadcast for vast hauls of\ngolden fish, knew his days were numbered and that the number was small.\nBut, instead of this making him feel sympathetic and equal toward his\nmaster, thus unmasked as mere galvanized clay, it filled him with greater\nawe; for, to the Vagens, Death seems to wear a special costume and walk\nwith grander step to summon the rich and the high.",
        "“Yes, I’ll go–this very afternoon,” said Whitney more loudly, turning\nhis face toward the door through which came a faint feminine\nrustling–the froufrou of the finest, softest silk and finest,\nsoftest linen.",
        "He looked attentively at his wife as she crossed the threshold–looked\nwith eyes that saw mercilessly but indifferently, the eyes of those who\nare out of the game of life, out for good and all, and so care nothing\nabout it. He noted in her figure–in its solidity, its settledness–the\nsigns of age the beauty doctors were still almost successful in keeping\nout of that masklike face which was their creation rather than nature’s;\nhe noted the rough-looking red of that hair whose thinness was not\naltogether concealed despite the elaborate care with which it was\narranged to give the impression of careless abundance. He noted her\nhands; his eyes did not linger there, for the hands had the wrinkles and\nhollows and age marks which but for art would have been in the face, and\nthey gave him a feeling–he could not have defined it, but it made him\nshudder. His eyes rested again upon her face, with an expression of pity\nthat was slightly satirical. This struggle of hers seemed so petty and\nsilly to him now; how could any human being think any other fact\nimportant when the Great Fact hung from birth threateningly over all?",
        "“You feel worse to-day, dear?” said she, in the tones that sound\ncarefully attuned to create an impression of sympathy. Hers had now\nbecome the mechanically saccharine voice which sardonic time ultimately\nfastens upon the professionally sympathetic to make them known and mocked\nof all, even of the vainest seekers after sympathy.",
        "“On the contrary, I feel better,” he drawled, eyes half-shut. “No pain at\nall. But–horribly weak, as if I were going to faint in a minute or\ntwo–and I don’t give a damn for anything.” There was a personal fling\nin that last word, an insinuation that he knew her state of mind toward\nhim, and reciprocated.",
        "“Well, to-morrow Janet and her baby will be here,” said Mrs. Whitney, and\nher soothing tones seemed to stimulate him by irritation. “Then we’ll all\ngo down to Saint X together, if you still wish it.”",
        "“Don’t take that tone with me, I tell you!” he said with some energy in\nhis drawl. ’Don’t talk to me as if you were hanging over my deathbed\nlying to me about my going to live!” And he closed his eyes, and his\nbreath made his parted, languid lips flutter.",
        "“Mr. Vagen,” said Matilda, in her tone of sweet graciousness, “may I\ntrouble you to go and–”",
        "“Go to the devil, Vagen,” said Charles, starting up again that slow\nstream of fainting words and sentences. “Anywhere to get you out of the\nroom so you won’t fill the flapping ears of your friends with gossip\nabout Whitney and his wife. Though why she should send you out I can’t\nunderstand. If you and the servants don’t hear what’s going on, you make\nup and tattle worse than what really happens.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney gave Vagen a look of sweet resignation and Vagen responded\nwith an expression which said: “I understand. He is very ill. He is not\nresponsible. I admire your ladylike patience.” As Whitney’s eyes were\nclosed he missed this byplay.",
        "“Here, Vagen–before you go,” he drawled, waving a weary hand toward the\ntable at his elbow. “Here’s a check for ten thousand. You don’t deserve\nit, for you’ve used your position to try to get rich on the sly. But\ninasmuch as I was ’on to’ you, and dropped hints that made you lose, I’ve\nno hard feelings. Then, too, you did no worse than any other would have\ndone in your place. A man’s as good, and as bad, as he has the chance to\nbe. So take it. I’ve not made my will yet, and as I may not be able to, I\ngive you the money now. You’ll find the check in this top drawer, and\nsome other checks for the people near me. I suppose they’ll expect\nsomething–I’ve got ’em into the habit of it. Take ’em and run along and\nsend ’em off right away.”",
        "Vagen muttered inarticulate thanks. In fact, the check was making small\nimpression on him, or the revelation that his chief had eyes as keen for\nwhat was going on under his nose as for the great movements in the big\nfield. He could think only of that terrifying weakness, that significant\ngarrulousness.",
        "When Vagen was out of the way, Charles repeated: “I’m going this\nafternoon.” His listless eyes were gazing vacantly at the carved rosewood\nceiling. His hands–the hands of a corpse–looked horribly like sheathed,\ncrumpled claws in the gold silk cuffs of his dark-blue dressing gown. His\nnose, protruding from his sunken cheeks, seemed not like a huge beak, but\nindeed a beak.",
        "“But Janet–” began Mrs. Whitney, thinking as she spoke that he surely\nwould “not be spared to us much longer.”",
        "“Janet can follow–or stay here–or–I don’t care what she does,” droned\nWhitney. “Do you suppose I’m thinking about anybody but myself now? Would\nyou, if you were in my fix. I should say,” he amended cynically, ’willyou, when you’re in my fix?”",
        "“Charles!” exclaimed Matilda.",
        "Whitney’s smile checked her. “I’m not a fool,” he rambled on. “Do you\nsuppose I haven’t seen what was going on? Do you suppose I don’t know\nall of you wish I was out of it? Yes, out of it. And you needn’t bother\nto put on that shocked look; it doesn’t fool me. I used to say: ’I’ll\nbe generous with my family and give ’em more than they’d have if I was\ngone.’ ’No children waiting round eager for me to pass off,’ said I,\n’so that they can divide up my fortune.’ I’ve said that often and\noften. And I’ve acted on it. And I’ve raised up two as pampered,\nselfish children as ever lived. And now–The last seven months I’ve\nbeen losing money hand over fist. Everything I’ve gone into has turned\nout bad. I’m down to about half what I had a year ago–maybe less than\nhalf. And you and Ross–and no doubt that marchioness ex-daughter of\nmine–all know it. And you’re afraid if I live on, I’ll lose more,\nmaybe everything. Do you deny it?”",
        "Matilda was unable to speak. She had known he was less rich; but\nhalf!–\"maybe less!” The cuirass of steel, whalebone, kid, and linen\nwhich molded her body to a fashionable figure seemed to be closing in on\nher heart and lungs with a stifling clutch.",
        "“No, you don’t deny it. You couldn’t,” Whitney drawled on. “And so my\n’indulgent father’ damned foolishness ends just where I might have known\nit’d end. We’ve brought up the children to love money and show off,\ninstead of to love us and character and self-respect–God forgive me!”",
        "The room was profoundly silent: Charles thinking drowsily, yet vividly,\ntoo, of his life; Matilda burning in anguish over the lost half, or more,\nof the fortune–and Charles had always been secretive about his wealth,\nso she didn’t know how much the fortune was a year ago and couldn’t judge\nwhether much or little was left! Enough to uphold her social position? Or\nonly enough to keep her barely clear of the “middle class”?",
        "Soon Whitney’s voice broke in upon her torments. “I’ve been thinking a\ngreat deal, this last week, about Hiram Ranger.”",
        "Matilda, startled, gave him a wild look. “Charles!” she exclaimed.",
        "“Exactly,” said Whitney, a gleam of enjoyment in his dull eyes.",
        "In fact, ever since Hiram’s death his colossal figure had often dominated\nthe thoughts of Charles and Matilda Whitney. The will had set Charles to\nobserving, to seeing; it had set Matilda to speculating on the\npossibilities of her own husband’s stealthy relentlessness. At these\ndefinite, dreadful words of his, her vague alarms burst into a deafening\nchorus, jangling and clanging in her very ears.",
        "“Arthur Ranger,” continued Whitney, languid and absent, “has got out of\nthe beaten track of business–”",
        "“Yes; look at Hiram’s children!” urged Matilda. “Everybody that is\nanybody is down on Arthur. See what his wife has brought him to, with her\ncrazy, upsetting ideas! They tell me a good many of the best people in\nSaint X hardly speak to him. Yes, Charles, look at Hiram’s doings.”",
        "“Thanks to Hiram–what he inherited from Hiram and what Hiram had the\ngood sense not to let him inherit–he has become a somebody. He’s doing\nthings, and the fact that they aren’t just the kind of things I like\ndoesn’t make me fool enough to underestimate them or him. Success is the\ntest, and in his line he’s a success.”",
        "“If it hadn’t been for his wife he’d not have done much,” said\nMatilda sourly.",
        "“You’ve lived long enough, I’d think, to have learned not to say such\nshallow things,” drawled he. “Of course, he has learned from her–don’t\neverybody have to learn somewhere? Where a man learns is nothing; the\nimportant thing is his capacity to learn. If a man’s got the capacity to\nlearn, he’ll learn, he’ll become somebody. If he hasn’t, then no man nor\nno woman can teach him. No, my dear, you may be sure that anybody who\namounts to anything has got it in himself. And Arthur Ranger is a credit\nto any father. He’s becoming famous–the papers are full of what he’s\naccomplishing. And he’s respected, honest, able, with a wife that loves\nhim. Would he have been anybody if his father had left him the money that\nwould have compelled him to be a fool? As for the girl, she’s got a showy\nstreak in her–she’s your regular American woman of nowadays–the kind of\ndaughter your sort of mother and my sort of damn-fool father breed up.\nBut Del’s mother wasn’t like you, Mattie, and she hadn’t a fool father\nlike me, so she’s married to a young fellow that’s already doing big\nthings, in his line–and a good line his is, a better line than trimming\ndollars and donkeys. Our Jenny–Jane that used to be–We’ve sold her to a\nFrenchman, and she’s sold herself to the devil. Hiram’s daughter–God\nforgive us, Matilda, for what we’ve done to Janet.” All this, including\nthat last devout appeal, in the manner of a spectator of a scene at which\nhe is taking a last, indifferent, backward glance as he is leaving.",
        "His wife’s brain was too busy making plans and tearing them up to follow\nhis monotonous garrulity except in a general way. He waited in vain for\nher to defend her daughter and herself.",
        "“As for Ross,” he went on, “he’s keen and quick enough. He’s got\ntogether quite a fortune of his own–and he’ll hold on to it and get\nmore. It’s easy enough to make money if you’ve got money–and ain’t\ntoo finicky about the look and the smell of the dollars before you\ngulp ’em down. Your Ross has a good strong stomach that way–as good\nas his father’s–and mother’s. But–He ain’t exactly the man I used to\npicture as I was wheeling him up and down the street in his baby\ncarriage in Saint X.”",
        "That vulgar reminiscence seemed to be the signal for which Matilda was\nwaiting. “Charles Whitney,” she said, “you and I have brought up our\nchildren to take their proper place in our aristocracy of wealth and\nbirth and breeding. And I know you’re not going to undo what we’ve done,\nand done well.”",
        "“That’s your ’bossy’ tone, Mattie,” he drawled, his desire to talk\ngetting a fresh excuse for indulging itself. “I guess this is a good\ntime to let you into a secret. You’ve thought you ran me ever since we\nwere engaged. That delusion of yours nearly lost you the chance to lead\nthese thirty years of wedded bliss with me. If you hadn’t happened to\nmake me jealous and afraid the one man I used to envy in those days\nwould get you–I laughed the other day when he was appointed postmaster\nat Indianapolis–However, I did marry you, and did let you imagine you\nwore the pants. It seemed to amuse you, and it certainly amused\nme–though not in the same way. Now I want you to look back and think\nhard. You can’t remember a single time that what you bossed me to do was\never done. I was always fond of playing tricks and pulling secret wires,\nand I did a lot of it in making you think you were bossing me when you\nwere really being bossed.”",
        "It was all Mrs. Whitney could do to keep her mind on how sick he was, and\nhow imperative it was not to get him out of humor. “I never meant to try\nto influence you, Charles,” she said, “except as anyone tries to help\nthose about one. And certainly you’ve been the one that has put us all in\nour present position. That’s why it distressed me for you even to talk of\nundoing your work.”",
        "Whitney smiled satirically, mysteriously. “I’ll do what I think best,\"\nwas all he replied. And presently he added, “though I don’t feel like\ndoing anything. It seems to me I don’t care what happens, or whether I\nlive–or–don’t. I’ll go to Saint X. I’m just about strong enough to\nstand the trip–and have Schulze come out to Point Helen this evening.”",
        "“Why not save your strength and have him come here?” urged Matilda.",
        "“He wouldn’t,” replied her husband. “Last time I saw him he looked me\nover and said: ’Champagne. If you don’t stop it you won’t live. Don’t\ncome here again unless you cut out that poison.’ But I never could resist\nchampagne. So I told myself he was an old crank, and found a great doctor\nI could hire to agree with me. No use to send for Schulze to come all\nthis distance. I might even have to go to his office if I was at Saint X.\nHe won’t go to see anybody who’s able to move about. ’As they want me,\nlet ’em come to me, just as I’d go to them if I wanted them,’ he says.\n’The air they get on the way is part of the cure.’ Besides, he and I had\na quarrel. He was talking his nonsense against religion, and I said\nsomething, and he implied I wasn’t as straight in business as I should\nbe–quoted something about ’He that hasteth to be rich shall not be\ninnocent,’ and one thing led to another, and finally he said, with that\nugly jeer of his: ’You pious bandits are lucky to have a forgiving God to\ngo to. Now we poor devils have only our self-respect, and it never\nforgives anything.’” Whitney laughed, reflected, laughed again. “Yes, I\nmust see Schulze. Maybe–Anyhow, I’m going to Saint X–going home, or as\nnear home as anything my money has left me.”",
        "He drowsed off. She sat watching him–the great beak, the bulging\nforehead, the thin, cruel lips; and everywhere in the garden of\nartificial flowers which formed the surface of her nature, hiding its\nreality even from herself, there appeared the poisonous snakes of hateful\nthoughts to shoot their fangs and hiss at him. She shrank and shuddered;\nyet–\"It’s altogether his own fault that I feel this way toward him as he\nlies dying,” she said to herself, resorting to human nature’s unfailing,\nuniversally sought comforter in all trying circumstances–self-excuse.\n“He always was cold and hard. He has become a monster. And even in his\nbest days he wasn’t worthy to have such a woman as I am. And now he is\nthinking of cheating me–and will do it–unless God prevents him.”",
        "He drowsed on, more asleep than awake, not even rousing when they put him\nto bed. He did not go to Saint X that day. But he did go later–went to\nlie in state in the corridor of the splendid hall he had given Tecumseh;\nto be gaped at by thousands who could not see that they were viewing a\nfew pounds of molded clay, so busy were their imaginations with the vast\nfortune it was supposed he left; to be preached over, the sermon by Dr.\nHargrave, who believed in him–and so, in estimating the man as\ndistinguished from what the system he lived under had made of him,\nperhaps came nearer the truth than those who talked only of the facts of\nhis public career–his piracy, his bushwhacking, his gambling with the\nmarked cards and loaded dice of “high finance\"; to be buried in the old\nCedar Grove Cemetery, with an imposing monument presently over him,\nbefore it fresh flowers every day for a year–the Marchioness of St.\nBerthè contracted with a florist to attend to that.",
        "Four days after the funeral Janet sent a servant down to Adelaide and to\nMrs. Ranger with notes begging them to come to Point Helen for lunch.\n“We are lonely and so dreary,” she wrote Adelaide. “We want you–need\nyou.” Only one answer was possible, and at half-past twelve they set out\nin Mrs. Ranger’s carriage. As they drove away from the Villa d’Orsay Mrs.\nRanger said: “When does Mrs. Dorsey allow to come home?”",
        "“Not for two years more,” replied Del.",
        "Ellen’s expression suggested that she was debating whether or not to\nspeak some thought which she feared Del might regard as meddlesome. “When\nyou finally do have to get out,” she said presently, “it’ll be like\ngiving up your own home, won’t it?”",
        "“No,” said Del. “I hate the place!” A pause, then: “I wrote Mrs. Dorsey\nyesterday that we wouldn’t stay but three months longer–not in any\ncircumstances.”",
        "The old woman’s face brightened. “I’m mighty glad of that,” she said\nheartily. “Then, you’ll have a home of your own at last.”",
        "“Not exactly,” was Del’s reply, in a curious tone. “The fact is, I’m\ngoing to live with Dr. Hargrave.”",
        "Ellen showed her astonishment. “And old Martha Skeffington!”",
        "“She’s not so difficult, once you get to know her,” replied Del. “I find\nthat everything depends on the point of view you take in looking at\npeople. I’ve been getting better acquainted with Dory’s aunt the last few\nweeks. I think she has begun to like me. We’ll get along.”",
        "“Don’t you think you’d better wait till Dory gets back?”",
        "“No,” said Adelaide firmly, a look in her eyes which made her mother say\nto herself: “There’s the Ranger in her.”",
        "They drove in silence awhile; then Del, with an effort which brought a\nbright color to her cheeks, began: “I want to tell you, mother, that I\nwent to Judge Torrey this morning, and made over to you the income\nfather left me.”",
        "“Whatever did you do that for?” cried Ellen, turning in the seat to\nstare at her daughter through her glasses.",
        "“I promised Dory I would. I’ve spent some of the money–about fifteen\nhundred dollars–You see, the house was more expensive than I thought.\nBut everything’s paid up now.”",
        "“I don’t need it, and don’t want it,” said Ellen. “And I won’t take it!”",
        "“I promised Dory I would–before we were married. He thinks I’ve done it.\nI’ve let him think so. And–lately–I’ve been having a sort of house\ncleaning–straightening things up–and I straightened that up, too.”",
        "Ellen Ranger understood. A long pause, during which she looked lovingly\nat her daughter’s beautiful face. At last she said: “No, there don’t seem\nto be no other way out of it.” Then, anxiously, “You ain’t written Dory\nwhat you’ve done?”",
        "“No,” replied Del. “Not yet.”",
        "“Not never!” exclaimed her mother. “That’s one of the things a body\nmustn’t ever tell anyone. You did wrong; you’ve done right–and it’s all\nsettled and over. He’d probably understand if you told him. But he’d\nnever quite trust you the same again–that’s human nature.”",
        "“But you’d trust me,” objected Del.",
        "“I’m older’n Dory,” replied her mother; “and, besides, I ain’t your\nhusband. There’s no end of husbands and wives that get into hot water\nthrough telling, where it don’t do any earthly good and makes the other\none uneasy and unhappy.”",
        "Adelaide reflected. “It is better not to tell him,” she concluded.",
        "Ellen was relieved. “That’s common sense,” said she. “And you can’t use\ntoo much common sense in marriage. The woman’s got to have it, for the\nmen never do where women are concerned.” She reflected a few minutes,\nthen, after a keen glance at her daughter and away, she said with an\nappearance of impersonality that evidenced diplomatic skill of no mean\norder: “And there’s this habit the women are getting nowadays of always\npeeping into their heads and hearts to see what’s going on. How can they\nexpect the cake to bake right if they’re first at the fire door, then at\nthe oven door, openin’ and shuttin’ ’em, peepin’ and pokin’ and\ntastin’–that’s what I’d like to know.”",
        "Adelaide looked at her mother’s apparently unconscious face in surprise\nand admiration. “What a sensible, wonderful woman you are, Ellen Ranger!\"\nshe exclaimed, giving her mother the sisterly name she always gave her\nwhen she felt a particular delight in the bond between them. And half to\nherself, yet so that her mother heard, she added: “And what a fool your\ndaughter has been!”",
        "“Nobody’s born wise,” said Ellen, “and mighty few takes the trouble\nto learn.”",
        "At Point Helen the mourning livery of the lodge keeper and of the hall\nservants prepared Ellen and her daughter for the correct and elegant\nhabiliments of woe in which Matilda and her son and daughter were garbed.\nIf Whitney had died before he began to lose his fortune, and while his\nfamily were in a good humor with him because of his careless generosity,\nor, rather, indifference to extravagance, he would have been mourned as\nsincerely as it is possible for human beings to mourn one by whose death\nthey are to profit enormously in title to the material possessions they\nhave been trained to esteem above all else in the world. As it was, those\nlast few months of anxiety–Mrs. Whitney worrying lest her luxury and\nsocial leadership should be passing, Ross exasperated by the daily\nstruggle to dissuade his father from fatuous enterprises–had changed\nWhitney’s death from a grief to a relief. However, “appearances\"\nconstrained Ross to a decent show of sorrow, compelled Mrs. Whitney to a\nstill stronger exhibit. Janet, who in far-away France had not been\ntouched by the financial anxieties, felt a genuine grief that gave her an\nadmirable stimulus to her efflorescent oversoul. She had “prepared for\nthe worst,” had brought from Paris a marvelous mourning wardrobe–dresses\nand hats and jewelry that set off her delicate loveliness as it had never\nbeen set off before. She made of herself an embodiment, an apotheosis,\nrather, of poetic woe–and so, roused to emulation her mother’s passion\nfor pose. Ross had refused to gratify them even to the extent of taking a\nspectator’s part in their refined theatricals. The coming of Mrs. Ranger\nand Adelaide gave them an audience other than servile; they proceeded to\nstrive to rise to the opportunity. The result of this struggle between\nmother and daughter was a spectacle so painful that even Ellen,\ndetermined to see only sincerity, found it impossible not to suspect a\ngrief that could find so much and such language in which to vent itself.\nShe fancied she appreciated why Ross eyed his mother and sister with\nunconcealed hostility and spoke almost harshly when they compelled him to\nbreak his silence.",
        "Adelaide hardly gave the two women a thought. She was surprised to find\nthat she was looking at Ross and thinking of him quite calmly and most\ncritically. His face seemed to her trivial, with a selfishness that more\nthan suggested meanness, the eyes looking out from a mind which\nhabitually entertained ideas not worth a real man’s while. What was the\nmatter with him–\"or with me?” What is he thinking about? Why is he\nlooking so mean and petty? Why had he no longer the least physical\nattraction for her? Why did her intense emotions of a few brief weeks\nago seem as vague as an unimportant occurrence of many years ago? What\nhad broken the spell? She could not answer her own puzzled questions;\nshe simply knew that it was so, that any idea that she did, or ever\ncould, love Ross Whitney was gone, and gone forever. “It’s so,” she\nthought. “What’s the difference why? Shall I never learn to let the\nstove doors alone?”",
        "As soon as lunch was over Matilda took Ellen to her boudoir and Ross went\naway, leaving Janet and Adelaide to walk up and down the shaded west\nterrace with its vast outlook upon the sinuous river and the hills. To\ndraw Janet from the painful theatricals, she took advantage of a casual\nquestion about the lynching, and went into the details of that red\nevening as she had not with anyone. It was now almost two months into the\npast; but all Saint X was still feverish from it, and she herself had\nonly begun again to have unhaunted and unbroken sleep. While she was\nrelating Janet forgot herself; but when the story was told–all of it\nexcept Adelaide’s own part; that she entirely omitted–Janet went back to\nher personal point of view. “A beautiful love story!” she exclaimed. “And\nright here in prosaic Saint X!”",
        "“Is it Saint X that is prosaic,” said Adelaide, “or is it we, in failing\nto see the truth about familiar things?”",
        "“Perhaps,” replied Janet, in the tone that means “not at all.” To her a\nthrill of emotion or a throb of pain felt by a titled person differed\nfrom the same sensation in an untitled person as a bar of supernal or\ninfernal music differs from the whistling of a farm boy on his way to\ngather the eggs; if the title was royal–Janet wept when an empress died\nof a cancer and talked of her “heroism” for weeks.",
        "“Of course,” she went on musingly, to Adelaide, “it was very beautiful\nfor Lorry and Estelle to love each other. Still, I can’t help feeling\nthat–At least, I can understand Arden Wilmot’s rage. After all, Estelle\nstepped out of her class; didn’t she, Del?”",
        "“Yes,” said Del, not recognizing the remark as one she herself might have\nmade not many months before. “Both she and Lorry stepped out of their\nclasses, and into the class where there is no class, but only just men\nand women, hearts and hands and brains.” She checked herself just in time\nto refrain from adding, “the class our fathers and mothers belonged in.”",
        "Janet did not inquire into the mystery of this. “And Estelle has gone to\nlive with poor Lorry’s mother!” said she. “How noble and touching! Such\nbeautiful self-sacrifice!”",
        "“Why self-sacrifice?” asked Del, irritated. “She couldn’t possibly go\nhome, could she? And she is fond of Lorry’s mother.”",
        "“Yes, of course. No doubt she’s a dear, lovely old woman. But–a\nwasherwoman, and constant, daily contact–and not as lady and servant,\nbut on what must be, after all, a sort of equality–” Janet finished her\nsentence with a ladylike look.",
        "Adelaide burned with the resentment of the new convert. “A woman who\nbrought into the world and brought up such a son as Lorry was,” said she,\n“needn’t yield to anybody.” Then the silliness of arguing such a matter\nwith Madame la Marquise de Saint Berthè came over her. “You and I don’t\nlook at life from the same standpoint, Janet,” she added, smiling. “You\nsee, you’re a lady, and I’m not–any more.”",
        "“Oh, yes, you are,” Janet, the devoid of the sense of humor, hastened to\nassure her earnestly. “You know we in France don’t feel as they do in\nAmerica, that one gets or loses caste when one gets or loses money.\nBesides, Dory is in a profession that is quite aristocratic, and those\nlectures he delivered at Göttingen are really talked about everywhere on\nthe other side.”",
        "But Adelaide refused to be consoled. “No, I’m not a lady–not what you’d\ncall a lady, even as a Frenchwoman.”",
        "“Oh, but I’m a good American!” Janet protested, suddenly prudent and\nrushing into the pretenses our transplanted and acclimatized sisters are\ncareful to make when talking with us of the land whence comes their sole\nclaim to foreign aristocratic consideration–their income. “I’m really\nquite famous for my Americanism. I’ve done a great deal toward\nestablishing our ambassador at Paris in the best society. Coming from a\nrepublic and to a republic that isn’t recognized by our set in France, he\nwas having a hard time, though he and his wife are all right at home. Now\nthat there are more gentlemen in authority at Washington, our diplomats\nare of a much better class than they used to be. Everyone over there says\nso. Of course, you–that is we, are gradually becoming civilized and\nbuilding up an aristocracy.”",
        "“Yes, I suppose so,” said Adelaide, feeling that she must change the\nsubject or show her exasperation, yet unable to find any subject which\nJanet would not adorn with refined and cultured views. “Isn’t Ross,\nthere, looking for you?”",
        "He had just rushed from the house, his face, his manner violently\nagitated. As he saw Adelaide looking at him, he folded and put in his\npocket a letter which seemed to be the cause of his agitation. When the\ntwo young women came to where he was standing, he joined them and walked\nup and down with them, his sister, between him and Del, doing all the\ntalking. Out of the corner of her eye Del saw that his gaze was bent\nsavagely upon the ground and that his struggle for self-control was still\non. At the first opportunity she said: “I must get mother. We’ll have to\nbe going.”",
        "“Oh, no, not yet,” urged Janet, sincerity strong in her affected accents.\nDel felt that the sister, for some reason, as strongly wished not to be\nleft alone with the brother as the brother wished to be left alone with\nthe sister. In confirmation of this, Janet went on to say: “Anyhow, Ross\nwill tell your mother.”",
        "Ross scowled at his sister, made a hesitating, reluctant movement toward\nthe steps; just then Matilda and Ellen appeared. Adelaide saw that her\nmother had succeeded in getting through Matilda’s crust of sham and in\ntouch with her heart. At sight of her son Mrs. Whitney’s softened\ncountenance changed–hardened, Adelaide thought–and she said to him\neagerly: “Any news, any letters?”",
        "“This,” answered Ross explosively. He jerked the letter from his pocket,\ngave it to his mother.",
        "“You’ll excuse me–Ellen–Adelaide,” said Matilda, as she unfolded the\npaper with ringers that trembled. “This is very important.” Silence, as\nshe read, her eager glance leaping along the lines. Her expression became\nterrible; she burst out in a voice that was both anger and despair: “No\nwill! He wasn’t just trying to torment me when he said he hadn’t made\none. No will! Nothing but the draft of a scheme to leave everything to\nTecumseh–there’s your Hiram’s work, Ellen!”",
        "Adelaide’s gentle pressure on her mother’s arm was unnecessary; it was\ntoo evident that Matilda, beside herself, could not be held responsible\nfor anything she said. There was no pretense, no “oversoul” in her\nemotion now. She was as different from the Matilda of the luncheon table\nas the swollen and guttered face of woe in real life is different from\nthe graceful tragedy of the stage.",
        "“No will; what of it?” said Ellen gently. “It won’t make the least\ndifference. There’s just you and the children.”",
        "Adelaide, with clearer knowledge of certain dark phases of human nature\nand of the Whitney family, hastily interposed. “Yes, we must go,” said\nshe. “Good-by, Mrs. Whitney,” and she put out her hand.",
        "Mrs. Whitney neither saw nor heard. “Ellen!” she cried, her voice like\nher wild and haggard face. “What do you think of such a daughter as mine\nhere? Her father–”",
        "Janet, with eyes that dilated and contracted strangely, interrupted with\na sweet, deprecating, “Good-by, Adelaide dear. As I told you, I am\nleaving to-night–”",
        "There Ross laid his hand heavily on Janet’s shoulder. “You are going to\nstay, young lady,” he said between his teeth, “and hear what your mother\nhas to say about you.” His voice made Adelaide shudder, even before she\nsaw the black hate his eyes were hurling at his sister.",
        "“Yes, we want you, Ellen, and you, Del, to know her as she is,” Mrs.\nWhitney now raged on. “When she married, her father gave her a dowry,\nbought that title for her–paid as much as his whole fortune now amounts\nto. He did it solely because I begged him to. She knows the fight I had\nto win him over. And now that he’s gone, without making a will, she says\nshe’ll have her legal rights! Her legal rights! She’ll take\none-third of what he left. She’ll rob her brother and her mother!”",
        "Janet was plainly reminding herself that she must not forget that she was\na lady and a marchioness. In a manner in which quiet dignity was mingled\nwith a delicate soul’s shrinking from such brawling vulgarity as this\nthat was being forced upon her, she said, looking at Adelaide: “Papa\nnever intended that my dowry should be taken out of my share. It was a\npresent.” She looked calmly at her mother. “Just like your jewels,\nmamma.” She turned her clear, luminous eyes upon Ross. “Just like the\nopportunities he gave you to get your independent fortune.”",
        "Mrs. Whitney, trembling so that she could scarcely articulate, retorted:\n“At the time he said, and I told you, it was to come out of your share.\nAnd how you thanked me and kissed me and–” She stretched toward Ellen\nher shaking old woman’s hands, made repellent by the contrasting splendor\nof magnificent black pearl rings. “O Ellen, Ellen!” she quavered. “I\nthink my heart will burst!”",
        "“You did say he said so,” replied Janet softly, “but he never\ntold me.”",
        "“You–you–” stuttered Ross, flinging out his arms at her in a\nparoxysm of fury.",
        "“I refuse to discuss this any further,” said Janet, drawing herself up\nin the full majesty of her black-robed figure and turning her long\nshapely back on Ross. “Mrs. Ranger, I’m sure you and Del realize that\nmother and Ross are terribly upset, and not–”",
        "“They’ll realize that you are a cheat, a vulture in the guise of woman!\"\ncried Mrs. Whitney. “Ellen, tell her what she is!”",
        "Mrs. Ranger, her eyes down and her face expressing her agonized\nembarrassment, contrived to say: “You mustn’t bring me in, Mattie.\nAdelaide and I must go.”",
        "“No, you shall hear!” shrieked Mrs. Whitney, barring the way. “All the\nworld shall hear how this treacherous, ingrate daughter of mine–oh, the\nsting of that!–how she purposes to steal, yes, steal four times as much\nof her father’s estate as Ross or I get. Four times as much! I can’t\nbelieve the law allows it! But whether it does or not, Janet Whitney,\nGod won’t allow it! God will hear my cry, my curse on you.”",
        "“My conscience is clear,” said Janet, and her gaze, spiritual, exalted,\npatient, showed that she spoke the truth, that her mother’s looks and\nwords left her quite unscathed.",
        "Ross vented a vicious, jeering laugh. His mother, overcome with the\nsense of helplessness, collapsed from rage to grief and tears. She\nturned to Mrs. Ranger. “Your Hiram was right,” she wailed, “and my\nCharles said so just before he went. Look at my daughter, Ellen. Look at\nmy son–for he, too, is robbing me. He has his own fortune that his dead\nfather made for him; yet he, too, talks about his legal rights. He\ndemands his full third!”",
        "Adelaide did not look at Ross; yet she was seeing him inside and out, the\ninside through the outside.",
        "“My heartless children!” sobbed Matilda. “I can’t believe that they are\nthe same I brought into the world and watched over and saw that they had\neverything. God forgive them–and me. Your Hiram was right. Money has\ndone it. Money has made monsters of them. And I–oh, how I am punished!”",
        "All this time Ellen and Adelaide had been gradually retreating, the\nWhitneys following them. When Mrs. Whitney at last opened wide the\ncasket of her woe and revealed Ross there, too, he wheeled on Adelaide\nwith a protesting, appealing look. He was confident that he was in the\nright, that his case was different from Janet’s; confident also that\nAdelaide would feel that in defending his rights he was also defending\nhers that were to be. But before Del there had risen the scene after the\nreading of her own father’s will. She recalled her rebellious thoughts,\nsaw again Arthur’s fine face distorted by evil passions, heard again her\nmother’s terrible, just words: “Don’t trample on your father’s grave,\nArthur Ranger! I’ll put you both out of the house! Go to the Whitneys,\nwhere you belong!” And then she saw Arthur as he now was, and herself\nthe wife of Dory Hargrave. And she for the first time realized, as we\nrealize things only when they have become an accepted and unshakable\nbasic part of our lives, what her father had done, what her father was.\nHiram had won his daughter.",
        "“We are going now,” said Ellen, coming from the stupor of shame and\nhorror into which this volcanic disgorging of the secret minds and hearts\nof the Whitneys had plunged her. And the expression she fixed first upon\nJanet, then upon Ross, then upon Matilda, killed any disposition they\nmight have had to try to detain her. As she and Adelaide went toward her\ncarriage, Ross followed. Walking beside Adelaide, he began to protest in\na low tone and with passionate appeal against the verdict he could not\nbut read in her face. “It isn’t fair, it isn’t just!” he pleaded.\n“Adelaide, hear me! Don’t misjudge me. You know what your–your good\nopinion means to me.”",
        "She took her mother’s arm, and so drew farther away from him.",
        "“Forgive me,” he begged. “Janet put me out of my mind. It drove me mad to\nhave her rob–us.”",
        "At that “us” Adelaide fixed her gaze on his for an instant. And what he\nsaw in her eyes silenced him–silenced him on one subject forever.",
        "He left for Chicago without seeing either his sister or his mother\nagain. His impulse was to renounce to his mother his share of his\nfather’s estate. But one does not act hastily upon an impulse to give up\nnearly a million dollars. On reflection he decided against such\nexpensive and futile generosity. If it would gain him Adelaide–then,\nyes. But when it would gain him nothing but the applause of people who\nin the same circumstances would not have had even the impulse to forego\na million–\"Mother’s proper share will give her as much of an income as\na woman needs at her age and alone,” reasoned he. “Besides, she may\nmarry again. And I must not forget that but for her Janet would never\nhave got that dowry. She brought this upon herself. Her folly has cost\nme dearly enough. If I go away to live abroad or in New York–anywhere\nto be free of the Howlands–why I’ll need all I’ve got properly to\nestablish myself.”",
        "Janet and her baby left on a later train for the East. Before going she\ntried to see her mother. Her mother had wronged her in thought, had\nslandered her in word; but Janet forgave her and nobly wished her to have\nthe consolation of knowing it. Mrs. Whitney, however, prevented the\nexecution of this exalted purpose by refusing to answer the gentle\npersistent knocking and gentle appealing calls of “Mother, mother dear!\"\nat her locked boudoir door.",
