        "He strolled to the corner and glanced up and down the intersecting\nstreet, but saw nothing save the oases of light shed by the street lamps\nat the successive crossings. Then he strolled back the way he had come.\nHe was a shadow of a man sliding noiselessly and without undue movement\nthrough the semi darkness. Also he was very alert, like a wild animal in\nthe jungle, keenly perceptive and receptive. The movement of another in\nthe darkness about him would need to have been more shadowy than he to\nhave escaped him.",
        "In addition to the running advertisement of the state of affairs carried\nto him by his senses, he had a subtler perception, a feel, of the\natmosphere around him. He knew that the house in front of which he\npaused for a moment, contained children. Yet by no willed effort of\nperception did he have this knowledge. For that matter, he was not even\naware that he knew, so occult was the impression. Yet, did a moment\narise in which action, in relation to that house, were imperative, he\nwould have acted on the assumption that it contained children. He was\nnot aware of all that he knew about the neighborhood.",
        "In the same way, he knew not how, he knew that no danger threatened in\nthe footfalls that came up the cross street. Before he saw the walker,\nhe knew him for a belated pedestrian hurrying home. The walker came into\nview at the crossing and disappeared on up the street. The man that\nwatched, noted a light that flared up in the window of a house on the\ncorner, and as it died down he knew it for an expiring match. This was\nconscious identification of familiar phenomena, and through his mind\nflitted the thought, “Wanted to know what time.” In another house one\nroom was lighted. The light burned dimly and steadily, and he had the\nfeel that it was a sick room.",
        "He was especially interested in a house across the street in the middle\nof the block. To this house he paid most attention. No matter what way\nhe looked, nor what way he walked, his looks and his steps always\nreturned to it. Except for an open window above the porch, there was\nnothing unusual about the house. Nothing came in nor out. Nothing\nhappened. There were no lighted windows, nor had lights appeared and\ndisappeared in any of the windows. Yet it was the central point of his\nconsideration. He rallied to it each time after a divination of the\nstate of the neighborhood.",
        "Despite his feel of things, he was not confident. He was supremely\nconscious of the precariousness of his situation. Though unperturbed by\nthe footfalls of the chance pedestrian, he was as keyed up and sensitive\nand ready to be startled as any timorous deer. He was aware of the\npossibility of other intelligences prowling about in the\ndarkness–intelligences similar to his own in movement, perception, and\ndivination.",
        "Far down the street he caught a glimpse of something that moved. And he\nknew it was no late home-goer, but menace and danger. He whistled twice\nto the house across the street, then faded away shadow-like to the\ncorner and around the corner. Here he paused and looked about him\ncarefully. Reassured, he peered back around the corner and studied the\nobject that moved and that was coming nearer. He had divined aright. It\nwas a policeman.",
        "The man went down the cross street to the next corner, from the shelter\nof which he watched the corner he had just left. He saw the policeman\npass by, going straight on up the street. He paralleled the policeman’s\ncourse, and from the next corner again watched him go by; then he\nreturned the way he had come. He whistled once to the house across the\nstreet, and after a time whistled once again. There was reassurance in\nthe whistle, just as there had been warning in the previous double\nwhistle.",
        "He saw a dark bulk outline itself on the roof of the porch and slowly\ndescend a pillar. Then it came down the steps, passed through the small\niron gate, and went down the sidewalk, taking on the form of a man. He\nthat watched kept on his own side the street and moved on abreast to the\ncorner, where he crossed over and joined the other. He was quite small\nalongside the man he accosted.",
        "“How’d you make out, Matt?” he asked.",
        "The other grunted indistinctly, and walked on in silence a few steps.",
        "“I reckon I landed the goods,” he said.",
        "Jim chuckled in the darkness, and waited for further information. The\nblocks passed by; under their feet, and he grew impatient.",
        "“Well, how about them goods?” he asked. “What kind of a haul did you\nmake, anyway?”",
        "“I was too busy to figger it out, but it’s fat. I can tell you that\nmuch, Jim, it’s fat. I don’t dast to think how fat it is. Wait till we\nget to the room.”",
        "Jim looked at him keenly under the street lamp of the next crossing, and\nsaw that his face was a trifle grim and that he carried his left arm\npeculiarly.",
        "“What’s the matter with your arm?” he demanded.",
        "“The little cuss bit me. Hope I don’t get hydrophoby. Folks gets\nhydrophoby from man-bite sometimes, don’t they?”",
        "“Gave you a fight, eh!” Jim asked encouragingly.",
        "The other grunted.",
        "“You’re certainly bard to get information from,” Jim burst out\nirritably. “Tell us about it. You ain’t goin’ to lose money just\na-tellin’ a guy.”",
        "“I guess I choked him some,” came the answer. Then, by way of\nexplanation, “He woke up on me.”",
        "“You did it neat. I never heard a sound.”",
        "“Jim,” the other said with seriousness, “it’s a hangin’ matter. I fixed\n’m. I had to. He woke up on me. You an’ me’s got to do some layin’ low\nfor a spell.”",
        "Jim gave a low whistle of comprehension.",
        "“Did you hear me whistle!” he asked suddenly.",
        "“Sure. I was all done. I was just comin’ out.”",
        "“It was a bull. But he wasn’t on a little bit. Went right by an’ kept\na-paddin’ the hoof outa sight. Then I came back an’ gave you the\nwhistle. What made you take so long after that?”",
        "“I was waitin’ to make sure,” Matt explained.",
        "“I was mighty glad when I heard you whistle again. It’s hard work\nwaitin’. I just sat there an’ thought an’ thought ... oh, all kinds of\nthings. It’s remarkable what a fellow’ll think about. And then there\nwas a darn cat that kept movin’ around the house an’ botherin’ me with\nits noises.”",
        "“An’ it’s fat!” Jim exclaimed irrelevantly and with joy.",
        "“I’m sure tellin’ you, Jim, it’s fat. I’m plum’ anxious for another look\nat ’em.”",
        "Unconsciously the two men quickened their pace. Yet they did not relax\nfrom their caution. Twice they changed their course in order to avoid\npolicemen, and they made very sure that they were not observed when they\ndived into the dark hallway of a cheap rooming house down town.",
        "Not until they had gained their own room on the top floor, did they\nscratch a match. While Jim lighted a lamp, Matt locked the door and\nthrew the bolts into place. As he turned, he noticed that his partner\nwas waiting expectantly. Matt smiled to himself at the other’s\neagerness.",
        "“Them search-lights is all right,” he said, drawing forth a small pocket\nelectric lamp and examining it. “But we got to get a new battery. It’s\nrunnin’ pretty weak. I thought once or twice it’d leave me in the dark.\nFunny arrangements in that house. I near got lost. His room was on the\nleft, an’ that fooled me some.”",
        "“I told you it was on the left,” Jim interrupted.",
        "“You told me it was on the right,” Matt went on. “I guess I know what\nyou told me, an’ there’s the map you drew.”",
        "Fumbling in his vest pocket, he drew out a folded slip of paper. As he\nunfolded it, Jim bent over and looked.",
        "“I did make a mistake,” he confessed.",
        "“You sure did. It got me guessin’ some for a while.”",
        "“But it don’t matter now,” Jim cried. “Let’s see what you got.”",
        "“It does matter,” Matt retorted. “It matters a lot ... to me. I’ve got\nto run all the risk. I put my head in the trap while you stay on the\nstreet. You got to get on to yourself an’ be more careful. All right,\nI’ll show you.”",
        "He dipped loosely into his trousers pocket and brought out a handful of\nsmall diamonds. He spilled them out in a blazing stream on the greasy\ntable. Jim let out a great oath.",
        "“That’s nothing,” Matt said with triumphant complacence. “I ain’t begun\nyet.”",
        "From one pocket after another he continued bringing forth the spoil.\nThere were many diamonds wrapped in chamois skin that were larger than\nthose in the first handful. From one pocket he brought out a handful of\nvery small cut gems.",
        "“Sun dust,” he remarked, as he spilled them on the table in a space by\nthemselves.",
        "Jim examined them.",
        "“Just the same, they retail for a couple of dollars each,” he said. “Is\nthat all?”",
        "“Ain’t it enough?” the other demanded in an aggrieved tone.",
        "“Sure it is,” Jim answered with unqualified approval. “Better’n I\nexpected. I wouldn’t take a cent less than ten thousan’ for the bunch.”",
        "“Ten thousan’,” Matt sneered. “They’re worth twic’t that, an’ I don’t\nknow anything about joolery, either. Look at that big boy!”",
        "He picked it out from the sparkling heap and held it near to the lamp\nwith the air of an expert, weighing and judging.",
        "“Worth a thousan’ all by its lonely,” was Jim’s quicker judgment.",
        "“A thousan’ your grandmother,” was Matt’s scornful rejoinder. “You\ncouldn’t buy it for three.”",
        "“Wake me up! I’m dreamin’!” The sparkle of the gems was in Jim’s eyes,\nand he began sorting out the larger diamonds and examining them. “We’re\nrich men, Matt–we’ll be regular swells.”",
        "“It’ll take years to get rid of ’em,” was Matt’s more practical thought.",
        "“But think how we’ll live! Nothin’ to do but spend the money an’ go on\ngettin’ rid of ’em.”",
        "Matt’s eyes were beginning to sparkle, though sombrely, as his\nphlegmatic nature woke up.",
        "“I told you I didn’t dast think how fat it was,” he murmured in a low\nvoice.",
        "“What a killin’! What a killin’!” was the other’s more ecstatic\nutterance.",
        "“I almost forgot,” Matt said, thrusting his hand into his inside coat\npocket.",
        "A string of large pearls emerged from wrappings of tissue paper and\nchamois skin. Jim scarcely glanced at them.",
        "“They’re worth money,” he said, and returned to the diamonds.",
        "A silence fell on the two men. Jim played with the gems, running them\nthrough his fingers, sorting them into piles, and spreading them out\nflat and wide. He was a slender, weazened man, nervous, irritable,\nhigh-strung, and anaemic–a typical child of the gutter, with\nunbeautiful twisted features, small eyes, with face and mouth\nperpetually and feverishly hungry, brutish in a catlike way, stamped to\nthe core with degeneracy.",
        "Matt did not finger the diamonds. He sat with chin on hands and elbows\non table, blinking heavily at the blazing array. He was in every way a\ncontrast to the other. No city had bred him. He was heavy muscled and\nhairy, gorilla-like in strength and aspect. For him there was no unseen\nworld. His eyes were full and wide apart, and there seemed in them a\ncertain bold brotherliness. They inspired confidence. But a closer\ninspection would have shown that his eyes were just a trifle too full,\njust a shade too wide apart. He exceeded, spilled over the limits of\nnormality, and his features told lies about the man beneath.",
        "“The bunch is worth fifty thousan’,” Jim remarked suddenly.",
        "“A hundred thousan’,” Matt said.",
        "The silence returned and endured a long time, to be broken again by Jim.",
        "“What in blazes was he doin’ with ’em all at the house?–that’s what I\nwant to know. I’d a-thought he’d kept ’em in the safe down at the\nstore.”",
        "Matt had just been considering the vision of the throttled man as he had\nlast looked upon him in the dim light of the electric lantern; but he\ndid not start at the mention of him.",
        "“There’s no tellin’,” he answered. “He might a-been getting ready to\nchuck his pardner. He might a-pulled out in the mornin’ for parts\nunknown, if we hadn’t happened along. I guess there’s just as many\nthieves among honest men as there is among thieves. You read about such\nthings in the papers, Jim. Pardners is always knifin’ each other.”",
        "A queer, nervous look came in the other’s eyes. Matt did not betray that\nhe noted it, though he said:–",
        "“What was you thinkin’ about, Jim!”",
        "Jim was a trifle awkward for the moment.",
        "“Nothin’,” he answered. “Only I was thinkin’ just how funny it was–all\nthem jools at his house. What made you ask?”",
        "“Nothin’. I was just wonderin’, that was all.”",
        "The silence settled down, broken by an occasional low and nervous giggle\non the part of Jim. He was overcome by the spread of gems. It was not\nthat he felt their beauty. He was unaware that they were beautiful in\nthemselves. But in them his swift imagination visioned the joys of life\nthey would buy, and all the desires and appetites of his diseased mind\nand sickly flesh were tickled by the promise they extended. He builded\nwondrous, orgy-haunted castles out of their brilliant fires, and was\nappalled at what he builded. Then it was that he giggled. It was all too\nimpossible to be real. And yet there they blazed on the table before\nhim, fanning the flame of the lust of him, and he giggled again.",
        "“I guess we might as well count ’em,” Matt said suddenly, tearing\nhimself away from his own visions. “You watch me an’ see that it’s\nsquare, because you an’ me has got to be on the square, Jim.\nUnderstand?”",
        "Jim did not like this, and betrayed it in his eyes, while Matt did not\nlike what he saw in his partner’s eyes.",
        "“Understand!” Matt repeated, almost menacingly.",
        "“Ain’t we always been square?” the other replied, on the defensive, what\nof the treachery already whispering in him.",
        "“It don’t cost nothin’, bein’ square in hard times,” Matt retorted.\n“It’s bein’ square in prosperity that counts. When we ain’t got nothin’,\nwe can’t help bein’ square. We’re prosperous now, an’ we’ve got to be\nbusiness men–honest business men. Understand?”",
        "“That’s the talk for me,” Jim approved, but deep down in the meagre soul\nof him,–and in spite of him,–wanton and lawless thoughts were stirring\nlike chained beasts.",
        "Matt stepped to the food shelf behind the two-burner kerosene cooking\nstove. He emptied the tea from a paper bag, and from a second bag\nemptied some red peppers. Returning to the table with the bags, he put\ninto them the two sizes of small diamonds. Then he counted the large\ngems and wrapped them in their tissue paper and chamois skin.",
        "“Hundred an’ forty-seven good-sized ones,” was his inventory; “twenty\nreal big ones; two big boys and one whopper; an’ a couple of fistfuls of\nteeny ones an’ dust.”",
        "He looked at Jim.",
        "“Correct,” was the response.",
        "He wrote the count out on a slip of memorandum paper, and made a copy of\nit, giving one slip to his partner and retaining the other.",
        "“Just for reference,” he said.",
        "Again he had recourse to the food shelf, where he emptied the sugar from\na large paper bag. Into this he thrust the diamonds, large and small,\nwrapped it up in a bandana handkerchief, and stowed it away under his\npillow. Then he sat down on the edge of the bed and took off his shoes.",
        "“An’ you think they’re worth a hundred thousan’?” Jim asked, pausing and\nlooking up from the unlacing of his shoe.",
        "“Sure,” was the answer. “I seen a dancer down in Arizona once, with some\nbig sparklers on her. They wasn’t real. She said if they was she\nwouldn’t be dancin’. Said they’d be worth all of fifty thousan’, an’\nshe didn’t have a dozen of ’em all told.”",
        "“Who’d work for a livin’?” Jim triumphantly demanded. “Pick an’ shovel\nwork!” he sneered. “Work like a dog all my life, an’ save all my wages,\nan’ I wouldn’t have half as much as we got to-night.”",
        "“Dish washin’s about your measure, an’ you couldn’t get more’n twenty a\nmonth an’ board. Your figgers is ’way off, but your point is well taken.\nLet them that likes it, work. I rode range for thirty a month when I was\nyoung an’ foolish. Well, I’m older, an’ I ain’t ridin’ range.”",
        "He got into bed on one side. Jim put out the light and followed him in\non the other side.",
        "“How’s your arm feel?” Jim queried amiably.",
        "Such concern was unusual, and Matt noted it, and replied:–",
        "“I guess there’s no danger of hydrophoby. What made you ask?”",
        "Jim felt in himself a guilty stir, and under his breath he cursed the\nother’s way of asking disagreeable questions; but aloud he answered:\n“Nothin’, only you seemed scared of it at first. What are you goin’ to\ndo with your share, Matt?”",
        "“Buy a cattle ranch in Arizona an’ set down an’ pay other men to ride\nrange for me. There’s some several I’d like to see askin’ a job from me,\nblast them! An’ now you shut your face, Jim. It’ll be some time before I\nbuy that ranch. Just now I’m goin’ to sleep.”",
        "But Jim lay long awake, nervous and twitching, rolling about restlessly\nand rolling himself wide awake every time he dozed. The diamonds still\nblazed under his eyelids, and the fire of them hurt. Matt, in spite of\nhis heavy nature, slept lightly, like a wild animal alert in its sleep;\nand Jim noticed, every time he moved, that his partner’s body moved\nsufficiently to show that it had received the impression and that it was\ntrembling on the verge of awakening. For that matter, Jim did not know\nwhether or not, frequently, the other was awake. Once, quietly,\nbetokening complete consciousness, Matt said to him: “Aw, go to sleep,\nJim. Don’t worry about them jools. They’ll keep.” And Jim had thought\nthat at that particular moment Matt had been surely asleep.",
        "In the late morning Matt was awake with Jim’s first movement, and\nthereafter he awoke and dozed with him until midday, when they got up\ntogether and began dressing.",
        "“I’m goin’ out to get a paper an’ some bread,” Matt said. “You boil the\ncoffee.”",
        "As Jim listened, unconsciously his gaze left Matt’s face and roved to\nthe pillow, beneath which was the bundle wrapped in the bandana\nhandkerchief. On the instant Matt’s face became like a wild beast’s.",
        "“Look here, Jim,” he snarled. “You’ve got to play square. If you do me\ndirt, I’ll fix you. Understand? I’d eat you, Jim. You know that. I’d\nbite right into your throat an’ eat you like that much beefsteak.”",
        "His sunburned skin was black with the surge of blood in it, and his\ntobacco-stained teeth were exposed by the snarling lips. Jim shivered\nand involuntarily cowered. There was death in the man he looked at. Only\nthe night before that black-faced man had killed another with his hands,\nand it had not hurt his sleep. And in his own heart Jim was aware of a\nsneaking guilt, of a train of thought that merited all that was\nthreatened.",
        "Matt passed out, leaving him still shivering. Then a hatred twisted his\nown face, and he softly hurled savage threats at the door. He remembered\nthe jewels, and hastened to the bed, feeling under the pillow for the\nbandana bundle. He crushed it with his fingers to make certain that it\nstill contained the diamonds. Assured that Matt had not carried them\naway, he looked toward the kerosene stove with a guilty start. Then he\nhurriedly lighted it, filled the coffee pot at the sink, and put it over\nthe flame.",
        "The coffee was boiling when Matt returned, and while the latter cut the\nbread and put a slice of butter on the table, Jim poured out the coffee.\nIt was not until he sat down and had taken a few sips of the coffee,\nthat Matt pulled out the morning paper from his pocket.",
        "“We was way off,” he said. “I told you I didn’t dast figger out how fat\nit was. Look at that.”",
        "He pointed to the head lines on the first page. “SWIFT NEMESIS ON\nBUJANNOFF’S TRACK,” they read. “MURDERED IN HIS SLEEP AFTER ROBBING HIS\nPARTNER.”",
        "“There you have it!” Matt cried. “He robbed his partner–robbed him\nlike a dirty thief.”",
        "“Half a million of jewels missin’,” Jim read aloud. He put the paper\ndown and stared at Matt.",
        "“That’s what I told you,” the latter said. “What in thunder do we know\nabout jools? Half a million!–an’ the best I could figger it was a\nhundred thousan’. Go on an’ read the rest of it.”",
        "They read on silently, their heads side by side, the untouched coffee\ngrowing cold; and ever and anon one or the other burst forth with some\nsalient printed fact.",
        "“I’d like to seen Metzner’s face when he opened the safe at the store\nthis mornin’,” Jim gloated.",
        "“He hit the high places right away for Bujannoff’s house,” Matt\nexplained. “Go on an’ read.”",
        "“Was to have sailed last night at ten on the Sajoda for the South\nSeas–steamship delayed by extra freight––”",
        "“That’s why we caught ’m in bed,” Matt interrupted. “It was just\nluck–like pickin’ a fifty-to-one winner.”",
        "“Sajoda sailed at six this mornin’––”",
        "“He didn’t catch her,” Matt said. “I saw his alarm clock was set at\nfive. That’d given ’m plenty of time ... only I come along an’ put the\nkibosh on his time. Go on.”",
        "“Adolph Metzner in despair–the famous Haythorne pearl\nnecklace–magnificently assorted pearls–valued by experts at from fifty\nto seventy thousan’ dollars.”",
        "Jim broke off to say solemnly, “Those oyster-eggs worth all that money!”",
        "He licked his lips and added, “They was beauties an’ no mistake.”",
        "“Big Brazilian gem,” he read on. “Eighty thousan’ dollars–many valuable\ngems of the first water–several thousan’ small diamonds well worth\nforty thousan’.”",
        "“What you don’t know about jools is worth knowin’,” Matt smiled good\nhumoredly.",
        "“Theory of the sleuths,” Jim read. “Thieves must have known–cleverly\nkept watch on Bujannoff’s actions–must have learned his plan and\ntrailed him to his house with the fruits of his robbery–”",
        "“Clever–” Matt broke out. “That’s the way reputations is made ... in\nthe noos-papers. How’d we know he was robbin’ his pardner?”",
        "“Anyway, we’ve got the goods,” Jim grinned. “Let’s look at ’em again.”",
        "He assured himself that the door was locked and bolted, while Matt\nbrought out the bundle in the bandana and opened it on the table.",
        "“Ain’t they beauties, though!” Jim exclaimed at sight of the pearls; and\nfor a time he had eyes only for them. “Accordin’ to the experts, worth\nfrom fifty to seventy thousan’ dollars.”",
        "“An’ women like them things,” Matt commented. “An’ they’ll do everything\nto get ’em–sell themselves, commit murder, anything.”",
        "“Just like you an’ me.”",
        "“Not on your life,” Matt retorted. “I’ll commit murder for ’em, but not\nfor their own sakes, but for the sake of what they’ll get me. That’s the\ndifference. Women want the jools for themselves, an’ I want the jools\nfor the women an’ such things they’ll get me.”",
        "“Lucky that men an’ women don’t want the same things,” Jim remarked.",
        "“That’s what makes commerce,” Matt agreed; “people wantin’ different\nthings.”",
        "In the middle of the afternoon Jim went out to buy food. While he was\ngone, Matt cleared the table of the jewels, wrapping them up as before\nand putting them under the pillow. Then he lighted the kerosene stove\nand started to boil water for the coffee. A few minutes later, Jim\nreturned.",
        "“Most surprising,” he remarked. “Streets, an’ stores, an’ people just\nlike they always was. Nothin’ changed. An’ me walkin’ along through it\nall a millionnaire. Nobody looked at me an’ guessed it”",
        "Matt grunted unsympathetically. He had little comprehension of the\nlighter whims and fancies of his partner’s imagination.",
        "“Did you get a porterhouse?” he demanded.",
        "“Sure, an’ an inch thick. It’s a peach. Look at it.”",
        "He unwrapped the steak and held it up for the other’s inspection. Then\nhe made the coffee and set the table, while Matt fried the steak.",
        "“Don’t put on too much of them red peppers,” Jim warned. “I ain’t used\nto your Mexican cookin’. You always season too hot.”",
        "Matt grunted a laugh and went on with his cooking. Jim poured out the\ncoffee, but first, into the nicked china cup, he emptied a powder he had\ncarried in his vest pocket wrapped in a rice-paper. He had turned his\nback for the moment on his partner, but he did not dare to glance around\nat him. Matt placed a newspaper on the table, and on the newspaper set\nthe hot frying pan. He cut the steak in half, and served Jim and\nhimself.",
        "“Eat her while she’s hot,” he counselled, and with knife and fork set\nthe example.",
        "“She’s a dandy,” was Jim’s judgment, after his first mouthful. “But I\ntell you one thing straight. I’m never goin’ to visit you on that\nArizona ranch, so you needn’t ask me.”",
        "“What’s the matter now?” Matt asked.",
        "“The Mexican cookin’ on your ranch’d be too much for me. If I’ve got\nblue blazes a-comin’ in the next life, I’m not goin’ to torment my\ninsides in this one!”",
        "He smiled, expelled his breath forcibly to cool his burning mouth, drank\nsome coffee, and went on eating the steak.",
        "“What do you think about the next life anyway, Matt?” he asked a little\nlater, while secretly he wondered why the other had not yet touched his\ncoffee.",
        "“Ain’t no next life,” Matt answered, pausing from the steak to take his\nfirst sip of coffee. “Nor heaven nor hell, nor nothin’. You get all\nthat’s comin’ right here in this life.”",
        "“An’ afterward?” Jim queried out of his morbid curiosity, for he knew\nthat he looked upon a man that was soon to die. “An’ afterward?” he\nrepeated.",
        "“Did you ever see a man two weeks dead?” the other asked.",
        "Jim shook his head.",
        "“Well, I have. He was like this beefsteak you an’ me is eatin’. It was\nonce steer cavortin’ over the landscape. But now it’s just meat. That’s\nall, just meat. An’ that’s what you an’ me an’ all people come\nto–meat.”",
        "Matt gulped down the whole cup of coffee, and refilled the cup.",
        "“Are you scared to die?” he asked.",
        "Jim shook his head. “What’s the use? I don’t die anyway. I pass on an’\nlive again–”",
        "“To go stealin’, an’ lyin’, an’ snivellin’ through another life, an’ go\non that way forever an’ ever an’ ever?” Matt sneered.",
        "“Maybe I’ll improve,” Jim suggested hopefully. “Maybe stealin’ won’t be\nnecessary in the life to come.”",
        "He ceased abruptly, and stared straight before him, a frightened\nexpression on his face.",
        "“What’s the matter!” Matt demanded.",
        "“Nothin’. I was just wonderin’\"–Jim returned to himself with an\neffort–\"about this dyin’, that was all.”",
        "But he could not shake off the fright that had startled him. It was as\nif an unseen thing of gloom had passed him by, casting upon him the\nintangible shadow of its presence. He was aware of a feeling of\nforeboding. Something ominous was about to happen. Calamity hovered in\nthe air. He gazed fixedly across the table at the other man. He could\nnot understand. Was it that he had blundered and poisoned himself? No,\nMatt had the nicked cup, and he had certainly put the poison in the\nnicked cup.",
        "It was all his own imagination, was his next thought. It had played him\ntricks before. Fool! Of course it was. Of course something was about to\nhappen, but it was about to happen to Matt. Had not Matt drunk the\nwhole cup of coffee?",
        "Jim brightened up and finished his steak, sopping bread in the gravy\nwhen the meat was gone.",
        "“When I was a kid–” he began, but broke off abruptly.",
        "Again the unseen thing of gloom had fluttered, and his being was vibrant\nwith premonition of impending misfortune. He felt a disruptive influence\nat work in the flesh of him, and in all his muscles there was a seeming\nthat they were about to begin to twitch. He sat back suddenly, and as\nsuddenly leaned forward with his elbows on the table. A tremor ran dimly\nthrough the muscles of his body. It was like the first rustling of\nleaves before the oncoming of wind. He clenched his teeth. It came\nagain, a spasmodic tensing of his muscles. He knew panic at the revolt\nwithin his being. His muscles no longer recognized his mastery over\nthem. Again they spasmodically tensed, despite the will of him, for he\nhad willed that they should not tense. This was revolution within\nhimself, this was anarchy; and the terror of impotence rushed up in him\nas his flesh gripped and seemed to seize him in a clutch, chills running\nup and down his back and sweat starting on his brow. He glanced about\nthe room, and all the details of it smote him with a strange sense of\nfamiliarity. It was as though he had just returned from a long journey.\nHe looked across the table at his partner. Matt was watching him and\nsmiling. An expression of horror spread over Jim’s face.",
        "“Matt!” he screamed. “You ain’t doped me?”",
        "Matt smiled and continued to watch him. In the paroxysm that followed,\nJim did not become unconscious. His muscles tensed and twitched and\nknotted, hurting him and crushing him in their savage grip. And in the\nmidst of it all, it came to him that Matt was acting queerly. He was\ntraveling the same road. The smile had gone from his face, and there was\non it an intense expression, as if he were listening to some inner tale\nof himself and trying to divine the message. Matt got up and walked\nacross the room and back again, then sat down.",
        "“You did this, Jim,” he said quietly.",
        "“But I didn’t think you’d try to fix me,” Jim answered reproachfully.",
        "“Oh, I fixed you all right,” Matt said, with teeth close together and\nshivering body. “What did you give me?”",
        "“Strychnine.”",
        "“Same as I gave you,” Matt volunteered. “It’s some mess, ain’t it!”",
        "“You’re lyin’, Matt,” Jim pleaded. “You ain’t doped me, have you?”",
        "“I sure did, Jim; an’ I didn’t overdose you, neither. I cooked it in as\nneat as you please in your half the porterhouse.–Hold on! Where’re you\ngoin’?”",
        "Jim had made a dash for the door, and was throwing back the bolts. Matt\nsprang in between and shoved him away.",
        "“Drug store,” Jim panted. “Drug store.”",
        "“No you don’t. You’ll stay right here. There ain’t goin’ to be any\nrunnin’ out an’ makin’ a poison play on the street–not with all them\njools reposin’ under the pillow. Savve? Even if you didn’t die, you’d be\nin the hands of the police with a lot of explanations comin’. Emetics is\nthe stuff for poison. I’m just as bad bit as you, an’ I’m goin’ to take\na emetic. That’s all they’d give you at a drug store, anyway.”",
        "He thrust Jim back into the middle of the room and shot the bolts into\nplace. As he went across the floor to the food shelf, he passed one hand\nover his brow and flung off the beaded sweat. It spattered audibly on\nthe floor. Jim watched agonizedly as Matt got the mustard can and a cup\nand ran for the sink. He stirred a cupful of mustard and water and drank\nit down. Jim had followed him and was reaching with trembling hands for\nthe empty cup. Again Matt shoved him away. As he mixed a second cupful,\nhe demanded:",
        "“D’you think one cup’ll do for me? You can wait till I’m done.”",
        "Jim started to totter toward the door, but Matt checked him.",
        "“If you monkey with that door, I’ll twist your neck. Savve? You can take\nyours when I’m done. An’ if it saves you, I’ll twist your neck, anyway.\nYou ain’t got no chance, nohow. I told you many times what you’d get if\nyou did me dirt.”",
        "“But you did me dirt, too,” Jim articulated with an effort.",
        "Matt was drinking the second cupful, and did not answer. The sweat had\ngot into Jim’s eyes, and he could scarcely see his way to the table,\nwhere he got a cup for himself. But Matt was mixing a third cupful, and,\nas before, thrust him away.",
        "“I told you to wait till I was done,” Matt growled. “Get outa my way.”",
        "And Jim supported his twitching body by holding on to the sink, the\nwhile he yearned toward the yellowish concoction that stood for life. It\nwas by sheer will that he stood and clung to the sink. His flesh strove\nto double him up and bring him to the floor. Matt drank the third\ncupful, and with difficulty managed to get to a chair and sit down. His\nfirst paroxysm was passing. The spasms that afflicted him were dying\naway. This good effect he ascribed to the mustard and water. He was\nsafe, at any rate. He wiped the sweat from his face, and, in the\ninterval of calm, found room for curiosity. He looked at his partner.",
        "A spasm had shaken the mustard can out of Jim’s hands, and the contents\nwere spilled upon the floor. He stooped to scoop some of the mustard\ninto the cup, and the succeeding spasm doubled him up on the floor. Matt\nsmiled.",
        "“Stay with it,” he encouraged. “It’s the stuff all right. It’s fixed me\nup.”",
        "Jim heard him and turned toward him with a stricken face, twisted with\nsuffering and pleading. Spasm now followed spasm till he was in\nconvulsions, rolling on the floor and yellowing his face and hair in the\nmustard.",
        "Matt laughed hoarsely at the sight, but the laugh broke midway. A tremor\nhad run through his body. A new paroxysm was beginning. He arose and\nstaggered across to the sink, where, with probing forefinger, he vainly\nstrove to assist the action of the emetic. In the end, he clung to the\nsink as Jim had clung, filled with the horror of going down to the\nfloor.",
        "The other’s paroxysm had passed, and he sat up, weak and fainting, too\nweak to rise, his forehead dripping, his lips flecked with a foam made\nyellow by the mustard in which he had rolled. He rubbed his eyes with\nhis knuckles, and groans that were like whines came from his throat.",
        "“What are you snifflin’ about!” Matt demanded out of his agony. “All you\ngot to do is die. An’ when you die you’re dead.”",
        "“I ... ain’t ... snifflin’ ... it’s ... the ... mustard ... stingin’\n... my ... eyes,” Jim panted with desperate slowness.",
        "It was his last successful attempt at speech. Thereafter he babbled\nincoherently, pawing the air with shaking arms till a fresh convulsion\nstretched him on the floor.",
        "Matt struggled back to the chair, and, doubled up on it, with his arms\nclasped about his knees, he fought with his disintegrating flesh. He\ncame out of the convulsion cool and weak. He looked to see how it went\nwith the other, and saw him lying motionless.",
        "He tried to soliloquize, to be facetious, to have his last grim laugh at\nlife, but his lips made only incoherent sounds. The thought came to him\nthat the emetic had failed, and that nothing remained but the drug\nstore. He looked toward the door and drew himself to his feet. There he\nsaved himself from falling by clutching the chair. Another paroxysm had\nbegun. And in the midst of the paroxysm, with his body and all the parts\nof it flying apart and writhing and twisting back again into knots, he\nclung to the chair and shoved it before him across the floor. The last\nshreds of his will were leaving him when he gained the door. He turned\nthe key and shot back one bolt. He fumbled for the second bolt, but\nfailed. Then he leaned his weight against the door and slid down gently\nto the floor.",
