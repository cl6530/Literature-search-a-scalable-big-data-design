        "Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was\ncomplete.  The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness\nto his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility\ntowards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished\nfor; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon,\nwas such an instance of Lady Catherine’s condescension, as he\nknew not how to admire enough.",
        "“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised\nby her ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the\nevening at Rosings.  I rather expected, from my knowledge of\nher affability, that it would happen.  But who could have\nforeseen such an attention as this?  Who could have imagined\nthat we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation,\nmoreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your\narrival!”",
        "“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir\nWilliam, “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great\nreally are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\nAbout the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not\nuncommon.”",
        "Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning\nbut their visit to Rosings.  Mr. Collins was carefully instructing\nthem in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,\nso many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly\noverpower them.",
        "When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\nElizabeth–",
        "“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your\napparel.  Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of\ndress in us which becomes herself and her daughter.  I would\nadvise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior\nto the rest–there is no occasion for anything more.  Lady\nCatherine will not think the worse of you for being simply\ndressed.  She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.”",
        "While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their\ndifferent doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\nCatherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\nSuch formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of\nliving, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to\ncompany, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings\nwith as much apprehension as her father had done to his\npresentation at St. James’s.",
        "As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half\na mile across the park.  Every park has its beauty and its\nprospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though\nshe could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the\nscene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration\nof the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the\nglazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.",
        "When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was\nevery moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look\nperfectly calm.  Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her.  She had\nheard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any\nextraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere\nstateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness\nwithout trepidation.",
        "From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\nrapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,\nthey followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room\nwhere Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were\nsitting.  Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive\nthem; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the\noffice of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a\nproper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which\nhe would have thought necessary.",
        "In spite of having been at St. James’s Sir William was so\ncompletely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had\nbut just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his\nseat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost\nout of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing\nwhich way to look.  Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the\nscene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.\nLady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\nfeatures, which might once have been handsome.  Her air was\nnot conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as\nto make her visitors forget their inferior rank.  She was not\nrendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was\nspoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance,\nand brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and\nfrom the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady\nCatherine to be exactly what he represented.",
        "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and\ndeportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she\nturned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined\nin Maria’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small.  There\nwas neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies.\nMiss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not\nplain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in\na low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was\nnothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to\nwhat she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\nher eyes.",
        "After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the\nwindows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to\npoint out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing\nthem that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.",
        "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the\nservants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had\npromised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at\nthe bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as\nif he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.  He carved,\nand ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was\ncommended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\nenough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\nmanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\nBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,\nand gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the\ntable proved a novelty to them.  The party did not supply much\nconversation.  Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was\nan opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de\nBourgh–the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady\nCatherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.\nMrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss\nde Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\nshe was indisposed.  Maria thought speaking out of the question,\nand the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.",
        "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little\nto be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did\nwithout any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her\nopinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved\nthat she was not used to have her judgement controverted.  She\ninquired into Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and\nminutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management\nof them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so\nsmall a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her\ncows and her poultry.  Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath\nthis great lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an\noccasion of dictating to others.  In the intervals of her discourse\nwith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria\nand Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections\nshe knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a\nvery genteel, pretty kind of girl.  She asked her, at different\ntimes, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or\nyounger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be\nmarried, whether they were handsome, where they had been\neducated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\nmother’s maiden name?  Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\nquestions but answered them very composedly.  Lady Catherine\nthen observed,",
        "“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.  For\nyour sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I\nsee no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.  It was\nnot thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family.  Do you\nplay and sing, Miss Bennet?”",
        "“A little.”",
        "“Oh! then–some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.\nOur instrument is a capital one, probably superior to––You\nshall try it some day.  Do your sisters play and sing?”",
        "“One of them does.”",
        "“Why did not you all learn?  You ought all to have learned.  The\nMiss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income\nas yours.  Do you draw?”",
        "“No, not at all.”",
        "“What, none of you?”",
        "“Not one.”",
        "“That is very strange.  But I suppose you had no opportunity.\nYour mother should have taken you to town every spring for the\nbenefit of masters.”",
        "“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates\nLondon.”",
        "“Has your governess left you?”",
        "“We never had any governess.”",
        "“No governess!  How was that possible?  Five daughters brought\nup at home without a governess!  I never heard of such a thing.\nYour mother must have been quite a slave to your education.”",
        "Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had\nnot been the case.",
        "“Then, who taught you?  who attended to you?  Without a\ngoverness, you must have been neglected.”",
        "“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us\nas wished to learn never wanted the means.  We were always\nencouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\nThose who chose to be idle, certainly might.”",
        "“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and\nif I had known your mother, I should have advised her most\nstrenuously to engage one.  I always say that nothing is to be\ndone in education without steady and regular instruction, and\nnobody but a governess can give it.  It is wonderful how many\nfamilies I have been the means of supplying in that way.  I am\nalways glad to get a young person well placed out.  Four nieces\nof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my\nmeans; and it was but the other day that I recommended another\nyoung person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me,\nand the family are quite delighted with her.  Mrs. Collins, did I\ntell you of Lady Metcalf’s calling yesterday to thank me?  She\nfinds Miss Pope a treasure.  ’Lady Catherine,’ said she, ’you\nhave given me a treasure.’  Are any of your younger sisters out,\nMiss Bennet?”",
        "“Yes, ma’am, all.”",
        "“All!  What, all five out at once?  Very odd!  And you only\nthe second.  The younger ones out before the elder ones are\nmarried!  Your younger sisters must be very young?”",
        "“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.  Perhaps she is full young to\nbe much in company.  But really, ma’am, I think it would be\nvery hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their\nshare of society and amusement, because the elder may not have\nthe means or inclination to marry early.  The last-born has as\ngood a right to the pleasures of youth at the first.  And to be\nkept back on such a motive!  I think it would not be very likely\nto promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”",
        "“Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very\ndecidedly for so young a person.  Pray, what is your age?”",
        "“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth,\nsmiling, “your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”",
        "Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct\nanswer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature\nwho had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.",
        "“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need\nnot conceal your age.”",
        "“I am not one-and-twenty.”",
        "When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the\ncard-tables were placed.  Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr.\nand Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh\nchose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of\nassisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party.  Their table was\nsuperlatively stupid.  Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did\nnot relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her\nfears of Miss de Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or having\ntoo much or too little light.  A great deal more passed at the\nother table.  Lady Catherine was generally speaking–stating\nthe mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of\nherself.  Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything\nher ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and\napologising if he thought he won too many.  Sir William did not\nsay much.  He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble\nnames.",
        "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as\nthey chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered\nto Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered.\nThe party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine\ndetermine what weather they were to have on the morrow.  From\nthese instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the\ncoach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins’s\nside and as many bows on Sir William’s they departed.  As soon\nas they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\ncousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings,\nwhich, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it\nreally was.  But her commendation, though costing her some\ntrouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very\nsoon obliged to take her ladyship’s praise into his own hands.",
