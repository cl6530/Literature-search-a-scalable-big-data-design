        "Slowly the storm clouds drifted away. The twilight came.",
        "Still Brunhilde lay in fear and grief at Wotan’s feet.",
        "At length she lifted her sad eyes to Wotan and cried:–",
        "“Was it so wrong, this thing that I have done? ’T is you who taught me\nto shield the brave and the true. I only sought to care for one\nyou loved.”",
        "“Brunhilde, you disobeyed me. I have told you what your punishment shall\nbe. I cannot change it.”",
        "“Then grant me, Father, this one wish: that you will make the place\nwhere I sleep so no coward can reach me. Make it so none but a hero will\ndare come near.”",
        "Then, taking Brunhilde in his arms, he said:–",
        "“I grant your wish, my child. I shall encircle the place with magic\nfire. Only he who knows no fear may claim you for his bride.”",

        "Brunhilde’s noble steed lay down and slept.",
        "  “Farewell, my child, most brave and beautiful!\n  Thou life and light of all my heart, farewell!\n  Pride of my soul, farewell, a long farewell!”",
