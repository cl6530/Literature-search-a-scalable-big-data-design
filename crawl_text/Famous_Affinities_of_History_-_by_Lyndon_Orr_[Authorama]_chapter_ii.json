        "\nMarie Antoinette a la Rose (detail)\nby Elizabeth Vigee Lebrun\n",
        "It has often been said that the greatest Frenchman who ever lived\nwas in reality an Italian. It might with equal truth be asserted\nthat the greatest Russian woman who ever lived was in reality a\nGerman. But the Emperor Napoleon and the Empress Catharine II.\nresemble each other in something else. Napoleon, though Italian in\nblood and lineage, made himself so French in sympathy and\nunderstanding as to be able to play upon the imagination of all\nFrance as a great musician plays upon a splendid instrument, with\nabsolute sureness of touch and an ability to extract from it every\none of its varied harmonies. So the Empress Catharine of Russia–\nperhaps the greatest woman who ever ruled a nation–though born of\nGerman parents, became Russian to the core and made herself the\nembodiment of Russian feeling and Russian aspiration.",
        "At the middle of the eighteenth century Russia was governed by the\nEmpress Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great. In her own time,\nand for a long while afterward, her real capacity was obscured by\nher apparent indolence, her fondness for display, and her seeming\nvacillation; but now a very high place is accorded her in the\nhistory of Russian rulers. She softened the brutality that had\nreigned supreme in Russia. She patronized the arts. Her armies\ntwice defeated Frederick the Great and raided his capital, Berlin.\nHad Elizabeth lived, she would probably have crushed him.",
        "In her early years this imperial woman had been betrothed to Louis\nXV. of France, but the match was broken off. Subsequently she\nentered into a morganatic marriage and bore a son who, of course,\ncould not be her heir. In 1742, therefore, she looked about for a\nsuitable successor, and chose her nephew, Prince Peter of\nHolstein-Gottorp.",
        "Peter, then a mere youth of seventeen, was delighted with so\nsplendid a future, and came at once to St. Petersburg. The empress\nnext sought for a girl who might marry the young prince and thus\nbecome the future Czarina. She thought first of Frederick the\nGreat’s sister; but Frederick shrank from this alliance, though it\nwould have been of much advantage to him. He loved his sister–\nindeed, she was one of the few persons for whom he ever really\ncared. So he declined the offer and suggested instead the young\nPrincess Sophia of the tiny duchy of Anhalt-Zerbst.",
        "The reason for Frederick’s refusal was his knowledge of the semi-\nbarbarous conditions that prevailed at the Russian court.",
        "The Russian capital, at that time, was a bizarre, half-civilized,\nhalf-oriental place, where, among the very highest-born, a thin\nveneer of French elegance covered every form of brutality and\nsavagery and lust. It is not surprising, therefore, that Frederick\nthe Great was unwilling to have his sister plunged into such a\nlife.",
        "But when the Empress Elizabeth asked the Princess Sophia of\nAnhalt-Zerbst to marry the heir to the Russian throne the young\ngirl willingly accepted, the more so as her mother practically\ncommanded it. This mother of hers was a grim, harsh German woman\nwho had reared her daughter in the strictest fashion, depriving\nher of all pleasure with a truly puritanical severity. In the case\nof a different sort of girl this training would have crushed her\nspirit; but the Princess Sophia, though gentle and refined in\nmanner, had a power of endurance which was toughened and\nstrengthened by the discipline she underwent.",
        "And so in 1744, when she was but sixteen years of age, she was\ntaken by her mother to St. Petersburg. There she renounced the\nLutheran faith and was received into the Greek Church, changing\nher name to Catharine. Soon after, with great magnificence, she\nwas married to Prince Peter, and from that moment began a career\nwhich was to make her the most powerful woman in the world.",
        "At this time a lady of the Russian court wrote down a description\nof Catharine’s appearance. She was fair-haired, with dark-blue\neyes; and her face, though never beautiful, was made piquant and\nstriking by the fact that her brows were very dark in contrast\nwith her golden hair. Her complexion was not clear, yet her look\nwas a very pleasing one. She had a certain diffidence of manner at\nfirst; but later she bore herself with such instinctive dignity as\nto make her seem majestic, though in fact she was beneath the\nmiddle size. At the time of her marriage her figure was slight and\ngraceful; only in after years did she become stout. Altogether,\nshe came to St. Petersburg an attractive, pure-minded German\nmaiden, with a character well disciplined, and possessing reserves\nof power which had not yet been drawn upon.",
        "Frederick the Great’s forebodings, which had led him to withhold\nhis sister’s hand, were almost immediately justified in the case\nof Catharine. Her Russian husband revealed to her a mode of life\nwhich must have tried her very soul. This youth was only\nseventeen–a mere boy in age, and yet a full-grown man in the rank\nluxuriance of his vices. Moreover, he had eccentricities which\nsometimes verged upon insanity. Too young to be admitted to the\ncouncils of his imperial aunt, he occupied his time in ways that\nwere either ridiculous or vile.",
        "Next to the sleeping-room of his wife he kept a set of kennels,\nwith a number of dogs, which he spent hours in drilling as if they\nhad been soldiers. He had a troop of rats which he also drilled.\nIt was his delight to summon a court martial of his dogs to try\nthe rats for various military offenses, and then to have the\nculprits executed, leaving their bleeding carcasses upon the\nfloor. At any hour of the day or night Catharine, hidden in her\nchamber, could hear the yapping of the curs, the squeak of rats,\nand the word of command given by her half-idiot husband.",
        "When wearied of this diversion Peter would summon a troop of\nfavorites, both men and women, and with them he would drink deep\nof beer and vodka, since from his early childhood he had been both\na drunkard and a debauchee. The whoops and howls and vile songs of\nhis creatures could be heard by Catharine; and sometimes he would\nstagger into her rooms, accompanied by his drunken minions. With a\nsort of psychopathic perversity he would insist on giving\nCatharine the most minute and repulsive narratives of his amours,\nuntil she shrank from him with horror at his depravity and came to\nloathe the sight of his bloated face, with its little, twinkling,\nporcine eyes, his upturned nose and distended nostrils, and his\nloose-hung, lascivious mouth. She was scarcely less repelled when\na wholly different mood would seize upon him and he would declare\nhimself her slave, attending her at court functions in the garb of\na servant and professing an unbounded devotion for his bride.",
        "Catharine’s early training and her womanly nature led her for a\nlong time to submit to the caprices of her husband. In his saner\nmoments she would plead with him and strive to interest him in\nsomething better than his dogs and rats and venal mistresses; but\nPeter was incorrigible. Though he had moments of sense and even of\ngood feeling, these never lasted, and after them he would plunge\nheadlong into the most frantic excesses that his half-crazed\nimagination could devise.",
        "It is not strange that in course of time Catharine’s strong good\nsense showed her that she could do nothing with this creature. She\ntherefore gradually became estranged from him and set herself to\nthe task of doing those things which Peter was incapable of\ncarrying out.",
        "She saw that ever since the first awakening of Russia under Peter\nthe Great none of its rulers had been genuinely Russian, but had\ntried to force upon the Russian people various forms of western\ncivilization which were alien to the national spirit. Peter the\nGreat had striven to make his people Dutch. Elizabeth had tried to\nmake them French. Catharine, with a sure instinct, resolved that\nthey should remain Russian, borrowing what they needed from other\npeoples, but stirred always by the Slavic spirit and swayed by a\npatriotism that was their own. To this end she set herself to\nbecome Russian. She acquired the Russian language patiently and\naccurately. She adopted the Russian costume, appearing, except on\nstate occasions, in a simple gown of green, covering her fair\nhair, however, with a cap powdered with diamonds. Furthermore, she\nmade friends of such native Russians as were gifted with talent,\nwinning their favor, and, through them, the favor of the common\npeople.",
        "It would have been strange, however, had Catharine, the woman,\nescaped the tainting influences that surrounded her on every side.\nThe infidelities of Peter gradually made her feel that she owed\nhim nothing as his wife. Among the nobles there were men whose\nforce of character and of mind attracted her inevitably. Chastity\nwas a thing of which the average Russian had no conception; and\ntherefore it is not strange that Catharine, with her intense and\nsensitive nature, should have turned to some of these for the love\nwhich she had sought in vain from the half imbecile to whom she\nhad been married.",
        "Much has been written of this side of her earlier and later life;\nyet, though it is impossible to deny that she had favorites, one\nshould judge very gently the conduct of a girl so young and thrust\ninto a life whence all the virtues seemed to be excluded. She bore\nseveral children before her thirtieth year, and it is very certain\nthat a grave doubt exists as to their paternity. Among the nobles\nof the court were two whose courage and virility specially\nattracted her. The one with whom her name has been most often\ncoupled was Gregory Orloff. He and his brother, Alexis Orloff,\nwere Russians of the older type–powerful in frame, suave in\nmanner except when roused, yet with a tigerish ferocity slumbering\nunderneath. Their power fascinated Catharine, and it was currently\ndeclared that Gregory Orloff was her lover.",
        "When she was in her thirty-second year her husband was proclaimed\nCzar, after the death of the Empress Elizabeth. At first in some\nways his elevation seemed to sober him; but this period of sanity,\nlike those which had come to him before, lasted only a few weeks.\nHistorians have given him much credit for two great reforms that\nare connected with his name; and yet the manner in which they were\nactually brought about is rather ludicrous. He had shut himself up\nwith his favorite revelers, and had remained for several days\ndrinking and carousing until he scarcely knew enough to speak. At\nthis moment a young officer named Gudovitch, who was really loyal\nto the newly created Czar, burst into the banquet-hall, booted and\nspurred and his eyes aflame with indignation. Standing before\nPeter, his voice rang out with the tone of a battle trumpet, so\nthat the sounds of revelry were hushed.",
        "“Peter Feodorovitch,” he cried, “do you prefer these swine to\nthose who really wish to serve you? Is it in this way that you\nimitate the glories of your ancestor, that illustrious Peter whom\nyou have sworn to take as your model? It will not be long before\nyour people’s love will be changed to hatred. Rise up, my Czar!\nShake off this lethargy and sloth. Prove that you are worthy of\nthe faith which I and others have given you so loyally!”",
        "With these words Gudovitch thrust into Peter’s trembling hand two\nproclamations, one abolishing the secret bureau of police, which\nhad become an instrument of tyrannous oppression, and the other\nrestoring to the nobility many rights of which they had been\ndeprived.",
        "The earnestness and intensity of Gudovitch temporarily cleared the\nbrain of the drunken Czar. He seized the papers, and, without\nreading them, hastened at once to his great council, where he\ndeclared that they expressed his wishes. Great was the rejoicing\nin St. Petersburg, and great was the praise bestowed on Peter;\nyet, in fact, he had acted only as any drunkard might act under\nthe compulsion of a stronger will than his.",
        "As before, his brief period of good sense was succeeded by another\nof the wildest folly. It was not merely that he reversed the wise\npolicy of his aunt, but that he reverted to his early fondness for\neverything that was German. His bodyguard was made up of German\ntroops–thus exciting the jealousy of the Russian soldiers. He\nintroduced German fashions. He boasted that his father had been an\nofficer in the Prussian army. His crazy admiration for Frederick\nthe Great reached the utmost verge of sycophancy.",
        "As to Catharine, he turned on her with something like ferocity. He\ndeclared in public that his eldest son, the Czarevitch Paul, was\nreally fathered by Catharine’s lovers. At a state banquet he\nturned to Catharine and hurled at her a name which no woman could\npossibly forgive–and least of all a woman such as Catharine,\nwith her high spirit and imperial pride. He thrust his mistresses\nupon her; and at last he ordered her, with her own hand, to\ndecorate the Countess Vorontzoff, who was known to be his\nmaitresse en titre.",
        "It was not these gross insults, however, so much as a concern for\nher personal safety that led Catharine to take measures for her\nown defense. She was accustomed to Peter’s ordinary\neccentricities. On the ground of his unfaithfulness to her she now\nhad hardly any right to make complaint. But she might reasonably\nfear lest he was becoming mad. If he questioned the paternity of\ntheir eldest son he might take measures to imprison Catharine or\neven to destroy her. Therefore she conferred with the Orloffs and\nother gentlemen, and their conference rapidly developed into a\nconspiracy.",
        "The soldiery, as a whole, was loyal to the empress. It hated\nPeter’s Holstein guards. What she planned was probably the\ndeposition of Peter. She would have liked to place him under guard\nin some distant palace. But while the matter was still under\ndiscussion she was awakened early one morning by Alexis Orloff. He\ngrasped her arm with scant ceremony.",
        "“We must act at once,” said he. “We have been betrayed!”",
        "Catharine was not a woman to waste time. She went immediately to\nthe barracks in St. Petersburg, mounted upon a charger, and,\ncalling out the Russian guards, appealed to them for their\nsupport. To a man they clashed their weapons and roared forth a\nthunderous cheer. Immediately afterward the priests anointed her\nas regent in the name of her son; but as she left the church she\nwas saluted by the people, as well as by the soldiers, as empress\nin her own right.",
        "It was a bold stroke, and it succeeded down to the last detail.\nThe wretched Peter, who was drilling his German guards at a\ndistance from the capital, heard of the revolt, found that his\nsailors at Kronstadt would not acknowledge him, and then finally\nsubmitted. He was taken to Ropsha and confined within a single\nroom. To him came the Orloffs, quite of their own accord. Gregory\nOrloff endeavored to force a corrosive poison into Peter’s mouth.\nPeter, who was powerful of build and now quite desperate, hurled\nhimself upon his enemies. Alexis Orloff seized him by the throat\nwith a tremendous clutch and strangled him till the blood gushed\nfrom his ears. In a few moments the unfortunate man was dead.",
        "Catharine was shocked by the intelligence, but she had no choice\nsave to accept the result of excessive zeal. She issued a note to\nthe foreign ambassadors informing them that Peter had died of a\nviolent colic. When his body was laid out for burial the\nextravasated blood is said to have oozed out even through his\nhands, staining the gloves that had been placed upon them. No one\nbelieved the story of the colic; and some six years later Alexis\nOrloff told the truth with the utmost composure. The whole\nincident was characteristically Russian.",
        "It is not within the limits of our space to describe the reign of\nCatharine the Great–the exploits of her armies, the acuteness of\nher statecraft, the vast additions which she made to the Russian\nEmpire, and the impulse which she gave to science and art and\nliterature. Yet these things ought to be remembered first of all\nwhen one thinks of the woman whom Voltaire once styled “the\nSemiramis of the North.” Because she was so powerful, because no\none could gainsay her, she led in private a life which has been\nalmost more exploited than her great imperial achievements. And\nyet, though she had lovers whose names have been carefully\nrecorded, even she fulfilled the law of womanhood–which is to\nlove deeply and intensely only once,",
        "One should not place all her lovers in the same category. As a\ngirl, and when repelled by the imbecility of Peter, she gave\nherself to Gregory Orloff. She admired his strength, his daring,\nand his unscrupulousness. But to a woman of her fine intelligence\nhe came to seem almost more brute than man. She could not turn to\nhim for any of those delicate attentions which a woman loves so\nmuch, nor for that larger sympathy which wins the heart as well as\ncaptivates the senses. A writer of the time has said that Orloff\nwould hasten with equal readiness from the arms of Catharine to\nthe embraces of any flat-nosed Finn or filthy Calmuck or to the\nlowest creature whom he might encounter in the streets.",
        "It happened that at the time of Catharine’s appeal to the imperial\nguards there came to her notice another man who–as he proved in a\ntrifling and yet most significant manner–had those traits which\nOrloff lacked. Catharine had mounted, man–fashion, a cavalry\nhorse, and, with a helmet on her head, had reined up her steed\nbefore the barracks. At that moment One of the minor nobles, who\nwas also favorable to her, observed that her helmet had no plume.\nIn a moment his horse was at her side. Bowing low over his saddle,\nhe took his own plume from his helmet and fastened it to hers.\nThis man was Prince Gregory Potemkin, and this slight act gives a\nclue to the influence which he afterward exercised over his\nimperial mistress!",
        "When Catharine grew weary of the Orloffs, and when she had\nenriched them with lands and treasures, she turned to Potemkin;\nand from then until the day of his death he was more to her than\nany other man had ever been. With others she might flirt and might\ngo even further than flirtation; but she allowed no other favorite\nto share her confidence, to give advice, or to direct her\npolicies.",
        "To other men she made munificent gifts, either because they\npleased her for the moment or because they served her on one\noccasion or another; but to Potemkin she opened wide the whole\ntreasury of her vast realm. There was no limit to what she would\ndo for him. When he first knew her he was a man of very moderate\nfortune. Within two years after their intimate acquaintance had\nbegun she had given him nine million rubles, while afterward he\naccepted almost limitless estates in Poland and in every province\nof Greater Russia.",
        "He was a man of sumptuous tastes, and yet he cared but little for\nmere wealth. What he had, he used to please or gratify or surprise\nthe woman whom he loved. He built himself a great palace in St.\nPetersburg, usually known as the Taurian Palace, and there he gave\nthe most sumptuous entertainments, reversing the story of Antony\nand Cleopatra.",
        "In a superb library there stood one case containing volumes bound\nwith unusual richness. When the empress, attracted by the\nbindings, drew forth a book she found to her surprise that its\npages were English bank-notes. The pages of another proved to be\nDutch bank-notes, and, of another, notes on the Bank of Venice. Of\nthe remaining volumes some were of solid gold, while others had\npages of fine leather in which were set emeralds and rubies and\ndiamonds and other gems. The story reads like a bit of fiction\nfrom the Arabian Nights. Yet, after all, this was only a small\naffair compared with other undertakings with which Potemkin sought\nto please her.",
        "Thus, after Taurida and the Crimea had been added to the empire by\nPotemkin’s agency, Catharine set out with him to view her new\npossessions. A great fleet of magnificently decorated galleys bore\nher down the river Dnieper. The country through which she passed\nhad been a year before an unoccupied waste. Now, by Potemkin’s\nextraordinary efforts, the empress found it dotted thick with\ntowns and cities which had been erected for the occasion, filled\nwith a busy population which swarmed along the riverside to greet\nthe sovereign with applause. It was only a chain of fantom towns\nand cities, made of painted wood and canvas; but while Catharine\nwas there they were very real, seeming to have solid buildings,\nmagnificent arches, bustling industries, and beautiful stretches\nof fertile country. No human being ever wrought on so great a\nscale so marvelous a miracle of stage-management.",
        "Potemkin was, in fact, the one man who could appeal with unfailing\nsuccess to so versatile and powerful a spirit as Catharine’s. He\nwas handsome of person, graceful of manner, and with an intellect\nwhich matched her own. He never tried to force her inclination,\nand, on the other hand, he never strove to thwart it. To him, as\nto no other man, she could turn at any moment and feel that, no\nmatter what her mood, he could understand her fully. And this,\naccording to Balzac, is the thing that woman yearns for most–a\nkindred spirit that can understand without the slightest need of\nexplanation.",
        "Thus it was that Gregory Potemkin held a place in the soul of this\ngreat woman such as no one else attained. He might be absent,\nheading armies or ruling provinces, and on his return he would be\ngreeted with even greater fondness than before. And it was this\nrather than his victories over Turk and other oriental enemies\nthat made Catharine trust him absolutely.",
        "When he died, he died as the supreme master of her foreign policy\nand at a time when her word was powerful throughout all Europe.\nDeath came upon him after he had fought against it with singular\ntenacity of purpose. Catharine had given him a magnificent\ntriumph, and he had entertained her in his Taurian Palace with a\nsplendor such as even Russia had never known before. Then he fell\nill, though with high spirit he would not yield to illness. He ate\nrich meats and drank rich wines and bore himself as gallantly as\never. Yet all at once death came upon him while he was traveling\nin the south of Russia. His carriage was stopped, a rug was spread\nbeneath a tree by the roadside, and there he died, in the country\nwhich he had added to the realms of Russia,",
        "The great empress who loved him mourned him deeply during the five\nyears of life that still remained to her. The names of other men\nfor whom she had imagined that she cared were nothing to her. But\nthis one man lived in her heart in death as he had done in life.",
        "Many have written of Catharine as a great ruler, a wise diplomat,\na creature of heroic mold. Others have depicted her as a royal\nwanton and have gathered together a mass of vicious tales, the\ngossip of the palace kitchens, of the clubs, and of the barrack-\nrooms. But perhaps one finds the chief interest of her story to\nlie in this–that besides being empress and diplomat and a lover\nof pleasure she was, beyond all else, at heart a woman.",
        "The English-speaking world long ago accepted a conventional view\nof Marie Antoinette. The eloquence of Edmund Burke in one\nbrilliant passage has fixed, probably for all time, an enduring\npicture of this unhappy queen.",
        "When we speak or think of her we speak and think first of all of a\ndazzling and beautiful woman surrounded by the chivalry of France\nand gleaming like a star in the most splendid court of Europe. And\nthen there comes to us the reverse of the picture. We see her\ndespised, insulted, and made the butt of brutal men and still more\nfiendish women; until at last the hideous tumbrel conveys her to\nthe guillotine, where her head is severed from her body and her\ncorpse is cast down into a bloody pool.",
        "In these two pictures our emotions are played upon in turn–\nadmiration, reverence, devotion, and then pity, indignation, and\nthe shudderings of horror.",
        "Probably in our own country and in England this will remain the\nhistoric Marie Antoinette. Whatever the impartial historian may\nwrite, he can never induce the people at large to understand that\nthis queen was far from queenly, that the popular idea of her is\nalmost wholly false, and that both in her domestic life and as the\ngreatest lady in France she did much to bring on the terrors of\nthat revolution which swept her to the guillotine.",
        "In the first place, it is mere fiction that represents Maria\nAntoinette as having been physically beautiful. The painters and\nengravers have so idealized her face as in most cases to have\nproduced a purely imaginary portrait.",
        "She was born in Vienna, in 1755, the daughter of the Emperor\nFrancis and of that warrior-queen, Maria Theresa. She was a very\nGerman-looking child. Lady Jackson describes her as having a\nlong, thin face, small, pig-like eyes, a pinched-up mouth, with\nthe heavy Hapsburg lip, and with a somewhat misshapen form, so\nthat for years she had to be bandaged tightly to give her a more\nnatural figure.",
        "At fourteen, when she was betrothed to the heir to the French\nthrone, she was a dumpy, mean-looking little creature, with no\ndistinction whatever, and with only her bright golden hair to make\namends for her many blemishes. At fifteen she was married and\njoined the Dauphin in French territory.",
        "We must recall for a moment the conditions which prevailed in\nFrance. King Louis XV. was nearing his end. He was a man of the\nmost shameless life; yet he had concealed or gilded his infamies\nby an external dignity and magnificence which, were very pleasing\nto his people. The French, liked to think that their king was the\nmost splendid monarch and the greatest gentleman in Europe. The\ncourtiers about him might be vile beneath the surface, yet they\nwere compelled to deport themselves with the form and the\netiquette that had become traditional in France. They might be\npanders, or stock-jobbers, or sellers of political offices; yet\nthey must none the less have wit and grace and outward nobility of\nmanner.",
        "There was also a tradition regarding the French queen. However\nloose in character the other women of the court might be, she\nalone, like Caesar’s wife, must remain above suspicion. She must\nbe purer than the pure. No breath, of scandal must reach her or be\ndirected against her.",
        "In this way the French court, even under so dissolute a monarch as\nLouis XV., maintained its hold upon the loyalty of the people.\nCrowds came every morning to view the king in his bed before he\narose; the same crowds watched him as he was dressed by the\ngentlemen of the bedchamber, and as he breakfasted and went\nthrough all the functions which are usually private. The King of\nFrance must be a great actor. He must appear to his people as in\nreality a king-stately, dignified, and beyond all other human\nbeings in his remarkable presence.",
        "When the Dauphin and Marie Antoinette came to the French court\nKing Louis XV. kept up in the case the same semblance of\nausterity. He forbade these children to have their sleeping-\napartments together. He tried to teach them that if they were to\ngovern as well as to reign they must conform to the rigid\netiquette of Paris and Versailles.",
        "It proved a difficult task, however. The little German princess\nhad no natural dignity, though she came from a court where the\nvery strictest imperial discipline prevailed. Marie Antoinette\nfound that she could have her own way in many things, and she\nchose to enjoy life without regard to ceremony. Her escapades at\nfirst would have been thought mild enough had she not been a\n\"daughter of France\"; but they served to shock the old French\nking, and likewise, perhaps even more, her own imperial mother,\nMaria Theresa.",
        "When a report of the young girl’s conduct was brought to her the\nempress was at first mute with indignation. Then she cried out:",
        "“Can this girl be a child of mine? She surely must be a\nchangeling!”",
        "The Austrian ambassador to France was instructed to warn the\nDauphiness to be more discreet.",
        "“Tell her,” said Maria Theresa, “that she will lose her throne,\nand even her life, unless she shows more prudence.”",
        "But advice and remonstrance were of no avail. Perhaps they might\nhave been had her husband possessed a stronger character; but the\nyoung Louis was little more fitted to be a king than was his wife\nto be a queen. Dull of perception and indifferent to affairs of\nstate, he had only two interests that absorbed him. One was the\nlove of hunting, and the other was his desire to shut himself up\nin a sort of blacksmith shop, where he could hammer away at the\nanvil, blow the bellows, and manufacture small trifles of\nmechanical inventions. From this smudgy den he would emerge, sooty\nand greasy, an object of distaste to his frivolous princess, with\nher foamy laces and perfumes and pervasive daintiness.",
        "It was hinted in many quarters, and it has been many times\nrepeated, that Louis was lacking in virility. Certainly he had no\ninterest in the society of women and was wholly continent. But\nthis charge of physical incapacity seems to have had no real\nfoundation. It had been made against some of his predecessors. It\nwas afterward hurled at Napoleon the Great, and also Napoleon the\nLittle. In France, unless a royal personage was openly licentious,\nhe was almost sure to be jeered at by the people as a weakling.",
        "And so poor Louis XVI., as he came to be, was treated with a\nmixture of pity and contempt because he loved to hammer and mend\nlocks in his smithy or shoot game when he might have been\ncaressing ladies who would have been proud to have him choose them\nout.",
        "On the other hand, because of this opinion regarding Louis, people\nwere the more suspicious of Marie Antoinette. Some of them, in\ncoarse language, criticized her assumed infidelities; others, with\na polite sneer, affected to defend her. But the result of it all\nwas dangerous to both, especially as France was already verging\ntoward the deluge which Louis XV. had cynically predicted would\nfollow after him.",
        "In fact, the end came sooner than any one had guessed. Louis XV.,\nwho had become hopelessly and helplessly infatuated with the low-\nborn Jeanne du Barry, was stricken down with smallpox of the most\nvirulent type. For many days he lay in his gorgeous bed. Courtiers\ncrowded his sick-room and the adjacent hall, longing for the\nmoment when the breath would leave his body. He had lived an evil\nlife, and he was to die a loathsome death; yet he had borne\nhimself before men as a stately monarch. Though his people had\nsuffered in a thousand ways from his misgovernment, he was still\nLouis the Well Beloved, and they blamed his ministers of state for\nall the shocking wrongs that France had felt.",
        "The abler men, and some of the leaders of the people, however,\nlooked forward to the accession of Louis XVI. He at least was\nfrugal in his habits and almost plebeian in his tastes, and seemed\nto be one who would reduce the enormous taxes that had been levied\nupon France.",
        "The moment came when the Well Beloved died. His death-room was\nfetid with disease, and even the long corridors of the palace\nreeked with infection, while the motley mob of men and women, clad\nin silks and satins and glittering with jewels, hurried from the\nspot to pay their homage to the new Louis, who was spoken of as\n\"the Desired.” The body of the late monarch was hastily thrown\ninto a mass of quick-lime, and was driven away in a humble wagon,\nwithout guards and with no salute, save from a single veteran, who\nremembered the glories of Fontenoy and discharged his musket as\nthe royal corpse was carried through the palace gates.",
        "This was a critical moment in the history of France; but we have\nto consider it only as a critical moment in the history of Marie\nAntoinette. She was now queen. She had it in her power to restore\nto the French court its old-time grandeur, and, so far as the\nqueen was concerned, its purity. Above all, being a foreigner, she\nshould have kept herself free from reproach and above every shadow\nof suspicion.",
        "But here again the indifference of the king undoubtedly played a\nstrange part in her life. Had he borne himself as her lord and\nmaster she might have respected him. Had he shown her the\naffection of a husband she might have loved him. But he was\nneither imposing, nor, on the other hand, was he alluring. She\nwrote very frankly about him in a letter to the Count Orsini:",
        "My tastes are not the same as those of the king, who cares only\nfor hunting and blacksmith work. You will admit that I should not\nshow to advantage in a forge. I could not appear there as Vulcan,\nand the part of Venus might displease him even more than my\ntastes.",
        "Thus on the one side is a woman in the first bloom of youth,\nardent, eager–and neglected. On the other side is her husband,\nwhose sluggishness may be judged by quoting from a diary which he\nkept during the month in which he was married. Here is a part of\nit:",
        "Sunday, 13–Left Versailles. Supper and slept at Compignee, at the\nhouse of M. de Saint-Florentin.",
        "Monday, 14–Interview with Mme. la Dauphine.",
        "Tuesday, 15–Supped at La Muette. Slept at Versailles.",
        "Wednesday, 16–My marriage. Apartment in the gallery. Royal\nbanquet in the Salle d’Opera.",
        "Thursday, 17–Opera of “Perseus.”",
        "Friday, 18–Stag-hunt. Met at La Belle Image. Took one.",
        "Saturday, 19–Dress-ball in the Salle d’Opera. Fireworks.",
        "Thursday, 31–I had an indigestion.",
        "What might have been expected from a young girl placed as this\nqueen was placed? She was indeed an earlier Eugenie. The first was\nof royal blood, the second was almost a plebeian; but each was\nheadstrong, pleasure-loving, and with no real domestic ties. As\nMr. Kipling expresses it–",
        "and so the Austrian woman of 1776 and the Spanish woman of 1856\nfound amusement in very similar ways. They plunged into a sea of\nstrange frivolity, such as one finds to-day at the centers of high\nfashion. Marie Antoinette bedecked herself with eccentric\ngarments. On her head she wore a hat styled a “what-is-it,\"\ntowering many feet in height and flaunting parti-colored plumes.\nWorse than all this, she refused to wear corsets, and at some\ngreat functions she would appear in what looked exactly like a\nbedroom gown.",
        "She would even neglect the ordinary niceties of life. Her hands\nwere not well cared for. It was very difficult for the ladies in\nattendance to persuade her to brush her teeth with regularity.\nAgain, she would persist in wearing her frilled and lace-trimmed\npetticoats long after their dainty edges had been smirched and\nblackened.",
        "Yet these things might have been counteracted had she gone no\nfurther. Unfortunately, she did go further. She loved to dress at\nnight like a shop-girl and venture out into the world of Paris,\nwhere she was frequently followed and recognized. Think of it–the\nQueen of France, elbowed in dense crowds and seeking to attract\nthe attention of common soldiers!",
        "Of course, almost every one put the worst construction upon this,\nand after a time upon everything she did. When she took a fancy\nfor constructing labyrinths and secret passages in the palace, all\nParis vowed that she was planning means by which her various\nlovers might enter without observation. The hidden printing-\npresses of Paris swarmed with gross lampoons about this reckless\ngirl; and, although there was little truth in what they said,\nthere was enough to cloud her reputation. When she fell ill with\nthe measles she was attended in her sick-chamber by four gentlemen\nof the court. The king was forbidden to enter lest he might catch\nthe childish disorder.",
        "The apathy of the king, indeed, drove her into many a folly. After\nfour years of marriage, as Mrs. Mayne records, he had only reached\nthe point of giving her a chilly kiss. The fact that she had no\nchildren became a serious matter. Her brother, the Emperor Joseph\nof Austria, when he visited Paris, ventured to speak to the king\nupon the subject. Even the Austrian ambassador had thrown out\nhints that the house of Bourbon needed direct heirs. Louis grunted\nand said little, but he must have known how good was the advice.",
        "It was at about this time when there came to the French court a\nyoung Swede named Axel de Fersen, who bore the title of count, but\nwho was received less for his rank than for his winning manner,\nhis knightly bearing, and his handsome, sympathetic face. Romantic\nin spirit, he threw himself at once into a silent inner worship of\nMarie Antoinette, who had for him a singular attraction. Wherever\nhe could meet her they met. To her growing cynicism this breath of\npure yet ardent affection was very grateful. It came as something\nfresh and sweet into the feverish life she led.",
        "Other men had had the audacity to woo her–among them Duc de\nLauzun, whose complicity in the famous affair of the diamond\nnecklace afterward cast her, though innocent, into ruin; the Duc\nde Biron; and the Baron de Besenval, who had obtained much\ninfluence over her, which he used for the most evil purposes.\nBesenval tainted her mind by persuading her to read indecent\nbooks, in the hope that at last she would become his prey.",
        "But none of these men ever meant to Marie Antoinette what Fersen\nmeant. Though less than twenty years of age, he maintained the\nreserve of a great gentleman, and never forced himself upon her\nnotice. Yet their first acquaintance had occurred in such a way as\nto give to it a touch of intimacy. He had gone to a masked ball,\nand there had chosen for his partner a lady whose face was quite\nconcealed. Something drew the two together. The gaiety of the\nwoman and the chivalry of the man blended most harmoniously. It\nwas only afterward that he discovered that his chance partner was\nthe first lady in France. She kept his memory in her mind; for\nsome time later, when he was at a royal drawing-room and she heard\nhis voice, she exclaimed:",
        "“Ah, an old acquaintance!”",
        "From this time Fersen was among those who were most intimately\nfavored by the queen. He had the privilege of attending her\nprivate receptions at the palace of the Trianon, and was a\nconspicuous figure at the feasts given in the queen’s honor by the\nPrincess de Lamballe, a beautiful girl whose head was destined\nafterward to be severed from her body and borne upon a bloody pike\nthrough the streets of Paris. But as yet the deluge had not\narrived and the great and noble still danced upon the brink of a\nvolcano.",
        "Fersen grew more and more infatuated, nor could he quite conceal\nhis feelings. The queen, in her turn, was neither frightened nor\nindignant. His passion, so profound and yet so respectful, deeply\nmoved her. Then came a time when the truth was made clear to both\nof them. Fersen was near her while she was singing to the\nharpsichord, and “she was betrayed by her own music into an avowal\nwhich song made easy.” She forgot that she was Queen of France.\nShe only felt that her womanhood had been starved and slighted,\nand that here was a noble-minded lover of whom she could be proud.",
        "Some time after this announcement was officially made of the\napproaching accouchement of the queen. It was impossible that\nmalicious tongues should be silent. The king’s brother, the Comte\nde Provence, who hated the queen, just as the Bonapartes afterward\nhated Josephine, did his best to besmirch her reputation. He had,\nindeed, the extraordinary insolence to do so at a time when one\nwould suppose that the vilest of men would remain silent. The\nchild proved to be a princess, and she afterward received the\ntitle of Duchesse d’Angouleme. The King of Spain asked to be her\ngodfather at the christening, which was to be held in the\ncathedral of Notre Dame. The Spanish king was not present in\nperson, but asked the Comte de Provence to act as his proxy.",
        "On the appointed day the royal party proceeded to the cathedral,\nand the Comte de Provence presented the little child at the\nbaptismal font. The grand almoner, who presided, asked;",
        "“What name shall be given to this child?”",
        "The Comte de Provence answered in a sneering tone:",
        "“Oh, we don’t begin with that. The first thing to find out is who\nthe father and the mother are!”",
        "These words, spoken at such a place and such a time, and with a\nstrongly sardonic ring, set all Paris gossiping. It was a thinly\nveiled innuendo that the father of the child was not the King of\nFrance. Those about the court immediately began to look at Fersen\nwith significant smiles. The queen would gladly have kept him near\nher; but Fersen cared even more for her good name than for his\nlove of her. It would have been so easy to remain in the full\nenjoyment of his conquest; but he was too chivalrous for that, or,\nrather, he knew that the various ambassadors in Paris had told\ntheir respective governments of the rising scandal. In fact, the\nfollowing secret despatch was sent to the King of Sweden by his\nenvoy:",
        "I must confide to your majesty that the young Count Fersen has\nbeen so well received by the queen that various persons have taken\nit amiss. I own that I am sure that she has a liking for him. I\nhave seen proofs of it too certain to be doubted. During the last\nfew days the queen has not taken her eyes off him, and as she\ngazed they were full of tears. I beg your majesty to keep their\nsecret to yourself.",
        "The queen wept because Fersen had resolved to leave her lest she\nshould be exposed to further gossip. If he left her without any\napparent reason, the gossip would only be the more intense.\nTherefore he decided to join the French troops who were going to\nAmerica to fight under Lafayette. A brilliant but dissolute\nduchess taunted him when the news became known.",
        "“How is this?” said she. “Do you forsake your conquest?”",
        "But, “lying like a gentleman,” Fersen answered, quietly:",
        "“Had I made a conquest I should not forsake it. I go away free,\nand, unfortunately, without leaving any regret.”",
        "Nothing could have been more chivalrous than the pains which\nFersen took to shield the reputation of the queen. He even allowed\nit to be supposed that he was planning a marriage with a rich\nyoung Swedish woman who had been naturalized in England. As a\nmatter of fact, he departed for America, and not very long\nafterward the young woman in question married an Englishman.",
        "Fersen served in America for a time, returning, however, at the\nend of three years. He was one of the original Cincinnati, being\nadmitted to the order by Washington himself. When he returned to\nFrance he was received with high honors and was made colonel of\nthe royal Swedish regiment.",
        "The dangers threatening Louis and his court, which were now\ngigantic and appalling, forbade him to forsake the queen. By her\nside he did what he could to check the revolution; and, failing\nthis, he helped her to maintain an imperial dignity of manner\nwhich she might otherwise have lacked. He faced the bellowing mob\nwhich surrounded the Tuileries. Lafayette tried to make the\nNational Guard obey his orders, but he was jeered at for his\npains. Violent epithets were hurled at the king. The least\ninsulting name which they could give him was “a fat pig.” As for\nthe queen, the most filthy phrases were showered upon her by the\nmen, and even more so by the women, who swarmed out of the slums\nand sought her life.",
        "At last, in 1791, it was decided that the king and the queen and\ntheir children, of whom they now had three, should endeavor to\nescape from Paris. Fersen planned their flight, but it proved to\nbe a failure. Every one remembers how they were discovered and\nhalted at Varennes. The royal party was escorted back to Paris by\nthe mob, which chanted with insolent additions:",
        "“We’ve brought back the baker, the baker’s wife, and the baker’s\nboy! Now we shall have bread!”",
        "Against the savage fury which soon animated the French a foreigner\nlike Fersen could do very little; but he seems to have endeavored,\nnight and day, to serve the woman whom he loved. His efforts have\nbeen described by Grandat; but they were of no avail. The king and\nqueen were practically made prisoners. Their eldest son died. They\nwent through horrors that were stimulated by the wretch Hebert, at\nthe head of his so-called Madmen (Enrages). The king was executed\nin January, 1792. The queen dragged out a brief existence in a\nprison where she was for ever under the eyes of human brutes, who\nguarded her and watched her and jeered at her at times when even\nmen would be sensitive. Then, at last, she mounted the scaffold,\nand her head, with its shining hair, fell into the bloody basket.",
        "Marie Antoinette shows many contradictions in her character. As a\nyoung girl she was petulant and silly and almost unseemly in her\nactions. As a queen, with waning power, she took on a dignity\nwhich recalled the dignity of her imperial mother. At first a\nflirt, she fell deeply in love when she met a man who was worthy\nof that love. She lived for most part like a mere cocotte. She\ndied every inch a queen.",
        "One finds a curious resemblance between the fate of Marie\nAntoinette and that of her gallant lover, who outlived her for\nnearly twenty years. She died amid the shrieks and execrations of\na maddened populace in Paris; he was practically torn in pieces by\na mob in the streets of Stockholm. The day of his death was the\nanniversary of the flight to Varennes. To the last moment of his\nexistence he remained faithful to the memory of the royal woman\nwho had given herself so utterly to him.",
        "There will come a time when the name of Aaron Burr will be cleared\nfrom the prejudice which now surrounds it, when he will stand in\nthe public estimation side by side with Alexander Hamilton, whom\nhe shot in a duel in 1804, but whom in many respects he curiously\nresembled. When the white light of history shall have searched\nthem both they will appear as two remarkable men, each having his\nown undoubted faults and at the same time his equally undoubted\nvirtues.",
        "Burr and Hamilton were born within a year of each other–Burr\nbeing a grandson of Jonathan Edwards, and Alexander Hamilton being\nthe illegitimate son of a Scottish merchant in the West Indies.\nEach of them was short in stature, keen of intellect, of great\nphysical endurance, courage, and impressive personality. Each as a\nyoung man served on the staff of Washington during the\nRevolutionary War, and each of them quarreled with him, though in\na different way.",
        "On one occasion Burr was quite unjustly suspected by Washington of\nlooking over the latter’s shoulder while he was writing.\n\"Washington leaped to his feet with the exclamation:",
        "“How dare you, Colonel Burr?”",
        "Burr’s eyes flashed fire at the question, and he retorted,\nhaughtily:",
        "“Colonel Burr DARE do anything.”",
        "This, however, was the end of their altercation The cause of\nHamilton’s difference with his chief is not known, but it was a\nmuch more serious quarrel; so that the young officer left his\nstaff position in a fury and took no part in the war until the\nend, when he was present at the battle of Yorktown.",
        "Burr, on the other hand, helped Montgomery to storm the heights of\nQuebec, and nearly reached the upper citadel when his commander\nwas shot dead and the Americans retreated. In all this confusion\nBurr showed himself a man of mettle. The slain Montgomery was six\nfeet high, but Burr carried his body away with wonderful strength\namid a shower of musket-balls and grape-shot.",
        "Hamilton had no belief in the American Constitution, which he\ncalled “a shattered, feeble thing.” He could never obtain an\nelective office, and he would have preferred to see the United\nStates transformed into a kingdom. Washington’s magnanimity and\nclear-sightedness made Hamilton Secretary of the Treasury. Burr,\non the other hand, continued his military service until the war\nwas ended, routing the enemy at Hackensack, enduring the horrors\nof Valley Forge, commanding a brigade at the battle of Monmouth,\nand heading the defense of the city of New Haven. He was also\nattorney-general of New York, was elected to the United States\nSenate, was tied with Jefferson for the Presidency, and then\nbecame Vice-President.",
        "Both Hamilton and Burr were effective speakers; but, while\nHamilton was wordy and diffuse, Burr spoke always to the point,\nwith clear and cogent reasoning. Both were lavish spenders of\nmoney, and both were engaged in duels before the fatal one in\nwhich Hamilton fell. Both believed in dueling as the only way of\nsettling an affair of honor. Neither of them was averse to love\naffairs, though it may be said that Hamilton sought women, while\nBurr was rather sought by women. When Secretary of the Treasury,\nHamilton was obliged to confess an adulterous amour in order to\nsave himself from the charge of corrupt practices in public\noffice. So long as Burr’s wife lived he was a devoted, faithful\nhusband to her. Hamilton was obliged to confess his illicit acts\nwhile his wife, formerly Miss Elizabeth Schuyler, was living. She\nspent her later years in buying and destroying the compromising\ndocuments which her husband had published for his countrymen to\nread.",
        "The most extraordinary thing about Aaron Burr was the magnetic\nquality that was felt by every one who approached him. The roots\nof this penetrated down into a deep vitality. He was always young,\nalways alert, polished in manner, courageous with that sort of\ncourage which does not even recognize the presence of danger,\ncharming in conversation, and able to adapt it to men or women of\nany age whatever. His hair was still dark in his eightieth year.\nHis step was still elastic, his motions were still as spontaneous\nand energetic, as those of a youth.",
        "So it was that every one who knew him experienced his fascination.\nThe rough troops whom he led through the Canadian swamps felt the\niron hand of his discipline; yet they were devoted to him, since\nhe shared all their toils, faced all their dangers, and ate with\nthem the scraps of hide which they gnawed to keep the breath of\nlife in their shrunken bodies.",
        "Burr’s discipline was indeed very strict, so that at first raw\nrecruits rebelled against it. On one occasion the men of an\nuntrained company resented it so bitterly that they decided to\nshoot Colonel Burr as he paraded them for roll-call that evening.\nBurr somehow got word of it and contrived to have all the\ncartridges drawn from their muskets. When the time for the roll-\ncall came one of the malcontents leaped from the front line and\nleveled his weapon at Burr.",
        "“Now is the time, boys!” he shouted.",
        "Like lightning Burr’s sword flashed from its scabbard with such a\nvigorous stroke as to cut the man’s arm completely off and partly\nto cleave the musket.",
        "“Take your place in the ranks,” said Burr.",
        "The mutineer obeyed, dripping with blood. A month later every man\nin that company was devoted to his commander. They had learned\nthat discipline was the surest source of safety.",
        "But with this high spirit and readiness to fight Burr had a most\npleasing way of meeting every one who came to him. When he was\narrested in the Western forests, charged with high treason, the\nsound of his voice won from jury after jury verdicts of acquittal.\nOften the sheriffs would not arrest him. One grand jury not merely\nexonerated him from all public misdemeanors, but brought in a\nstrong presentment against the officers of the government for\nmolesting him.",
        "It was the same everywhere. Burr made friends and devoted allies\namong all sorts of men. During his stay in France, England,\nGermany, and Sweden he interested such men as Charles Lamb, Jeremy\nBentham, Sir Walter Scott, Goethe, and Heeren. They found his mind\nable to meet with theirs on equal terms. Burr, indeed, had\ngraduated as a youth with honors from Princeton, and had continued\nhis studies there after graduation, which was then a most unusual\nthing to do. But, of course, he learned most from his contact with\nmen and women of the world.",
        "Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, in The Minister’s Wooing, has given\nwhat is probably an exact likeness of Aaron Burr, with his\nbrilliant gifts and some of his defects. It is strong testimony to\nthe character of Burr that Mrs. Stowe set out to paint him as a\nvillain; but before she had written long she felt his fascination\nand made her readers, in their own despite, admirers of this\nremarkable man. There are many parallels, indeed, between him and\nNapoleon–in the quickness of his intellect, the ready use of his\nresources, and his power over men, while he was more than Napoleon\nin his delightful gift of conversation and the easy play of his\ncultured mind.",
        "Those who are full of charm are willing also to be charmed. All\nhis life Burr was abstemious in food and drink. His tastes were\nmost refined. It is difficult to believe that such a man could\nhave been an unmitigated profligate.",
        "In his twentieth year there seems to have begun the first of the\nromances that run through the story of his long career. Perhaps\none ought not to call it the first romance, for at eighteen, while\nhe was studying law at Litchfield, a girl, whose name has been\nsuppressed, made an open avowal of love for him. Almost at the\nsame time an heiress with a large fortune would have married him\nhad he been willing to accept her hand. But at this period he was\nonly a boy and did not take such things seriously.",
        "Two years later, after Burr had seen hard service at Quebec and on\nManhattan Island, his name was associated with that of a very\nbeautiful girl named Margaret Moncrieffe. She was the daughter of\na British major, but in some way she had been captured while\nwithin the American lines. Her captivity was regarded as little\nmore than a joke; but while she was thus a prisoner she saw a\ngreat deal of Burr. For several months they were comrades, after\nwhich General Putnam sent her with his compliments to her father.",
        "Margaret Moncrieffe had a most emotional nature. There can be no\ndoubt that she deeply loved the handsome young American officer,\nwhom she never saw again. It is doubtful how far their intimacy\nwas carried. Later she married a Mr. Coghlan. After reaching\nmiddle life she wrote of Burr in a way which shows that neither\nyears nor the obligations of marriage could make her forget that\nyoung soldier, whom she speaks of as “the conqueror of her soul.\"\nIn the rather florid style of those days the once youthful\nMargaret Moncrieffe expresses herself as follows:",
        "Oh, may these pages one day meet the eye of him who subdued my\nvirgin heart, whom the immutable, unerring laws of nature had\npointed out for my husband, but whose sacred decree the barbarous\ncustoms of society fatally violated!",
        "Commenting on this paragraph, Mr. H. C. Merwin justly remarks\nthat, whatever may have been Burr’s conduct toward Margaret\nMoncrieffe, the lady herself, who was the person chiefly\nconcerned, had no complaint to make of it. It certainly was no\nvery serious affair, since in the following year Burr met a lady\nwho, while she lived, was the only woman for whom he ever really\ncared.",
        "This was Theodosia Prevost, the wife of a major in the British\narmy. Burr met her first in 1777, while she was living with her\nsister in Westchester County. Burr’s command was fifteen miles\nacross the river, but distance and danger made no difference to\nhim. He used to mount a swift horse, inspect his sentinels and\noutposts, and then gallop to the Hudson, where a barge rowed by\nsix soldiers awaited him. The barge was well supplied with\nbuffalo-skins, upon which the horse was thrown with his legs\nbound, and then half an hour’s rowing brought them to the other\nside. There Burr resumed his horse, galloped to the house of Mrs.\nPrevost, and, after spending a few hours with her, returned in the\nsame way.",
        "Mrs. Prevost was by no means beautiful, but she had an\nattractiveness of her own. She was well educated and possessed\ncharming manners, with a disposition both gentle and affectionate.\nHer husband died soon after the beginning of the war, and then\nBurr married her. No more ideal family life could be conceived\nthan his, and the letters which passed between the two are full of\nadoration. Thus she wrote to him:",
        "Tell me, why do I grow every day more tenacious of your regard? Is\nit because each revolving day proves you more deserving?",
        "And thus Burr answered her:",
        "Continue to multiply your letters to me. They are all my solace.\nThe last six are constantly within my reach. I read them once a\nday at least. Write me all that I have asked, and a hundred things\nwhich I have not.",
        "When it is remembered that these letters were written after nine\nyears of marriage it is hard to believe all the evil things that\nhave been said of Burr.",
        "His wife died in 1794, and he then gave a double affection to his\ndaughter Theodosia, whose beauty and accomplishments were known\nthroughout the country. Burr took the greatest pains in her\neducation, and believed that she should be trained, as he had\nbeen, to be brave, industrious, and patient. He himself, who has\nbeen described as a voluptuary, delighted in the endurance of cold\nand heat and of severe labor.",
        "After his death one of his younger admirers was asked what Burr\nhad done for him. The reply was characteristic.",
        "“He made me iron,” was the answer.",
        "No father ever gave more attention to his daughter’s welfare. As\nto Theodosia’s studies he was very strict, making her read Greek\nand Latin every day, with drawing and music and history, in\naddition to French. Not long before her marriage to Joseph\nAllston, of South Carolina, Burr wrote to her:",
        "I really think, my dear Theo, that you will be very soon beyond\nall verbal criticism, and that my whole attention will be\npresently directed to the improvement of your style.",
        "Theodosia Burr married into a family of good old English stock,\nwhere riches were abundant, and high character was regarded as the\nbest of all possessions. Every one has heard of the mysterious\ntragedy which is associated with her history. In 1812, when her\nhusband had been elected Governor of his state, her only child–a\nsturdy boy of eleven–died, and Theodosia’s health was shattered\nby her sorrow. In the same year Burr returned from a sojourn in\nEurope, and his loving daughter embarked from Charleston on a\nschooner, the Patriot, to meet her father in New York. When Burr\narrived he was met by a letter which told him that his grandson\nwas dead and that Theodosia was coming to him.",
        "Weeks sped by, and no news was heard of the ill-fated Patriot. At\nlast it became evident that she must have gone down or in some\nother way have been lost. Burr and Governor Allston wrote to each\nother letter after letter, of which each one seems to surpass the\nagony of the other. At last all hope was given up. Governor\nAllston died soon after of a broken heart; but Burr, as became a\nStoic, acted otherwise.",
        "He concealed everything that reminded him of Theodosia. He never\nspoke of his lost daughter. His grief was too deep-seated and too\nterrible for speech. Only once did he ever allude to her, and this\nwas in a letter written to an afflicted friend, which contained\nthe words:",
        "Ever since the event which separated me from mankind I have been\nable neither to give nor to receive consolation.",
        "In time the crew of a pirate vessel was captured and sentenced to\nbe hanged. One of the men, who seemed to be less brutal than the\nrest, told how, in 1812, they had captured a schooner, and, after\ntheir usual practice, had compelled the passengers to walk the\nplank. All hesitated and showed cowardice, except only one–a\nbeautiful woman whose eyes were as bright and whose bearing was as\nunconcerned as if she were safe on shore. She quickly led the way,\nand, mounting the plank with a certain scorn of death, said to the\nothers:",
        "“Come, I will show you how to die.”",
        "It has always been supposed that this intrepid girl may have been\nTheodosia Allston. If so, she only acted as her father would have\ndone and in strict accordance with his teachings.",
        "This resolute courage, this stern joy in danger, this perfect\nequanimity, made Burr especially attractive to women, who love\ncourage, the more so when it is coupled with gentleness and\ngenerosity.",
        "Perhaps no man in our country has been so vehemently accused\nregarding his relations with the other sex. The most improbable\nstories were told about him, even by his friends. As to his\nenemies, they took boundless pains to paint him in the blackest\ncolors. According to them, no woman was safe from his intrigues.\nHe was a perfect devil in leading them astray and then casting\nthem aside.",
        "Thus one Matthew L. Davis, in whom Burr had confided as a friend,\nwrote of him long afterward a most unjust account–unjust because\nwe have proofs that it was false in the intensity of its abuse.\nDavis wrote:",
        "It is truly surprising how any individual could become so eminent\nas a soldier, as a statesman, and as a professional man who\ndevoted so much time to the other sex as was devoted by Colonel\nBurr. For more than half a century of his life they seemed to\nabsorb his whole thought. His intrigues were without number; the\nsacred bonds of friendship were unhesitatingly violated when they\noperated as barriers to the indulgence of his passions. In this\nparticular Burr appears to have been unfeeling and heartless.",
        "It is impossible to believe that the Spartan Burr, whose life was\none of incessant labor and whose kindliness toward every one was\nso well known, should have deserved a commentary like this. The\ncharge of immorality is so easily made and so difficult of\ndisproof that it has been flung promiscuously at all the great men\nof history, including, in our own country,",
        "Washington and Jefferson as well as Burr. In England, when\nGladstone was more than seventy years of age, he once stopped to\nask a question of a woman in the street. Within twenty-four hours\nthe London clubs were humming with a sort of demoniac glee over\nthe story that this aged and austere old gentleman was not above\nseeking common street amours.",
        "And so with Aaron Burr to a great extent. That he was a man of\nstrict morality it would be absurd to maintain. That he was a\nreckless and licentious profligate would be almost equally untrue.\nMr. H. O. Merwin has very truly said:",
        "Part of Burr’s reputation for profligacy was due, no doubt, to\nthat vanity respecting women of which Davis himself speaks. He\nnever refused to accept the parentage of a child.",
        "“Why do you allow this woman to saddle you with her child when you\nKNOW you are not the father of it?” said a friend to him a few\nmonths before his death.",
        "“Sir,” he replied, “when a lady does me the honor to name me the\nfather of her child I trust I shall always be too gallant to show\nmyself ungrateful for the favor.”",
        "There are two curious legends relating to Aaron Burr. They serve\nto show that his reputation became such that he could not enjoy\nthe society of a woman without having her regarded as his\nmistress.",
        "When he was United States Senator from New York he lived in\nPhiladelphia at the lodging-house of a Mrs. Payne, whose daughter,\nDorothy Todd, was the very youthful widow of an officer. This\nyoung woman was rather free in her manners, and Burr was very\nresponsive in his. At the time, however, nothing was thought of\nit; hut presently Burr brought to the house the serious and\nsomewhat pedantic James Madison and introduced him to the hoyden.",
        "Madison was then forty-seven years of age, a stranger to society,\nbut gradually rising to a prominent position in politics–\"the\ngreat little Madison,” as Burr rather lightly called him. Before\nvery long he had proposed marriage to the young widow. She\nhesitated, and some one referred the matter to President\nWashington. The Father of his Country answered in what was perhaps\nthe only opinion that he ever gave on the subject of matrimony. It\nis worth preserving because it shows that he had a sense of\nhumor:",
        "For my own part, I never did nor do I believe I ever shall give\nadvice to a woman who is setting out on a matrimonial voyage ... A\nwoman very rarely asks an opinion or seeks advice on such an\noccasion till her mind is wholly made up, and then it is with the\nhope and expectation of obtaining a sanction, and not that she\nmeans to be governed by your disapproval.",
        "Afterward when Dolly Madison with, her yellow turban and kittenish\nways was making a sensation in Washington society some one\nrecalled her old association with Burr. At once the story sprang\nto light that Burr had been her lover and that he had brought\nabout the match with Madison as an easy way of getting rid of her.",
        "There is another curious story which makes Martin Van Buren,\neighth President of the United States, to have been the\nillegitimate son of Aaron Burr. There is no earthly reason for\nbelieving this, except that Burr sometimes stopped overnight at\nthe tavern in Kinderhook which was kept by Van Buren’s putative\nfather, and that Van Buren in later life showed an astuteness\nequal to that of Aaron Burr himself, so that he was called by his\nopponents “the fox of Kinderhook.” But, as Van Buren was born in\nDecember of the same year (1782) in which Burr was married to\nTheodosia Prevost, the story is utterly improbable when we\nremember, as we must, the ardent affection which Burr showed his\nwife, not only before their marriage, but afterward until her\ndeath.",
        "Putting aside these purely spurious instances, as well as others\ncited by Mr. Parton, the fact remains that Aaron Burr, like Daniel\nWebster, found a great attraction in the society of women; that he\ncould please them and fascinate them to an extraordinary degree;\nand that during his later life he must be held quite culpable in\nthis respect. His love-making was ardent and rapid, as we shall\nafterward see in the case of his second marriage.",
        "Many other stories are told of him. For instance, it is said that\nhe once took a stage-coach from Jersey City to Philadelphia. The\nonly other occupant was a woman of high standing and one whose\nfamily deeply hated Aaron Burr. Nevertheless, so the story goes,\nbefore they had reached Newark she was absolutely swayed by his\ncharm of manner; and when the coach made its last stop before\nPhiladelphia she voluntarily became his mistress.",
        "It must also be said that, unlike those of Webster and Hamilton,\nhis intrigues were never carried on with women of the lower sort.\nThis may be held by some to deepen the charge against him; but\nmore truly does it exonerate him, since it really means that in\nmany cases these women of the world threw themselves at him and\nsought him as a lover, when otherwise he might never have thought\nof them.",
        "That he was not heartless and indifferent to those who had loved\nhim may be shown by the great care which he took to protect their\nnames and reputations. Thus, on the day before his duel with\nHamilton, he made a will in which he constituted his son-in-law as\nhis executor. At the same time he wrote a sealed letter to\nGovernor Allston in which he said:",
        "If you can pardon and indulge a folly, I would suggest that Mme. ––,\ntoo well known under the name of Leonora, has claims on my\nrecollection. She is now with her husband at Santiago, in Cuba.",
        "Another fact has been turned to his discredit. From many women, in\nthe course of his long life, he had received a great quantity of\nletters written by aristocratic hands on scented paper, and these\nletters he had never burned. Here again, perhaps, was shown the\nvanity of the man who loved love for its own sake. He kept all\nthese papers in a huge iron-clamped chest, and he instructed\nTheodosia in case he should die to burn every letter which might\ninjure any one.",
        "After Theodosia’s death Burr gave the same instructions to Matthew\nL. Davis, who did, indeed, burn them, though he made their\nexistence a means of blackening the character of Burr. He should\nhave destroyed them unopened, and should never have mentioned them\nin his memoirs of the man who trusted him as a friend.",
        "Such was Aaron Burr throughout a life which lasted for eighty\nyears. His last romance, at the age of seventy-eight, is worth\nnarrating because it has often been misunderstood.",
        "Mme. Jumel was a Rhode Island girl who at seventeen years of age\neloped with an English officer, Colonel Peter Croix. Her first\nhusband died while she was still quite young, and she then married\na French wine-merchant, Stephen Jumel, some twenty years her\nsenior, but a man of much vigor and intelligence. M. Jumel made a\nconsiderable fortune in New York, owning a small merchant fleet;\nand after Napoleon’s downfall he and his wife went to Paris, where\nshe made a great impression in the salons by her vivacity and wit\nand by her lavish expenditures.",
        "Losing, however, part of what she and her husband possessed, Mme.\nJumel returned to New York, bringing with her a great amount of\nfurniture and paintings, with which she decorated the historic\nhouse still standing in the upper part of Manhattan Island–a\nmansion held by her in her own right. She managed her estate with\nmuch ability; and in 1828 M. Jumel returned to live with her in\nwhat was in those days a splendid villa.",
        "Four years later, however, M. Jumel suffered an accident from\nwhich he died in a few days, leaving his wife still an attractive\nwoman and not very much past her prime. Soon after she had\noccasion to seek for legal advice, and for this purpose visited\nthe law-office of Aaron Burr. She had known him a good many years\nbefore; and, though he was now seventy-eight years of age, there\nwas no perceptible change in him. He was still courtly in manner,\ntactful, and deferential, while physically he was straight,\nactive, and vigorous.",
        "A little later she invited him to a formal banquet, where he\ndisplayed all his charms and shone to great advantage. When he was\nabout to lead her in to dinner, he said:",
        "“I give my hand, madam; my heart has long been yours.”",
        "These attentions he followed up with several other visits, and\nfinally proposed that she should marry him. Much fluttered and no\nless flattered, she uttered a sort of “No” which was not likely to\ndiscourage a man like Aaron Burr.",
        "“I shall come to you before very long,” he said, “accompanied by a\nclergyman; and then you will give me your hand because I want it.”",
        "This rapid sort of wooing was pleasantly embarrassing. The lady\nrather liked it; and so, on an afternoon when the sun was shining\nand the leaves were rustling in the breeze, Burr drove up to Mme.\nJumel’s mansion accompanied by Dr. Bogart–the very clergyman who\nhad married him to his first wife fifty years before.",
        "Mme. Jumel was now seriously disturbed, but her refusal was not a\nstrong one. There were reasons why she should accept the offer.\nThe great house was lonely. The management of her estate required\na man’s advice. Moreover, she was under the spell of Burr’s\nfascination. Therefore she arrayed herself in one of her most\nmagnificent Paris gowns; the members of her household and eight\nservants were called in and the ceremony was duly performed by Dr.\nBogart. A banquet followed. A dozen cobwebbed bottles of wine were\nbrought up from the cellar, and the marriage feast went on merrily\nuntil after midnight.",
        "This marriage was a singular one from many points of view. It was\nstrange that a man of seventy-eight should take by storm the\naffections of a woman so much younger than he–a woman of wealth\nand knowledge of the world. In the second place, it is odd that\nthere was still another woman–a mere girl–who was so infatuated\nwith Burr that when she was told of his marriage it nearly broke\nher heart. Finally, in the early part of that same year he had\nbeen accused of being the father of a new-born child, and in spite\nof his age every one believed the charge to be true. Here is a\ncase that it would be hard to parallel.",
        "The happiness of the newly married pair did not, however, last\nvery long. They made a wedding journey into Connecticut, of which\nstate Burr’s nephew was then Governor, and there Burr saw a\nmonster bridge over the Connecticut River, in which his wife had\nshares, though they brought her little income. He suggested that\nshe should transfer the investment, which, after all, was not a\nvery large one, and place it in a venture in Texas which looked\npromising. The speculation turned out to be a loss, however, and\nthis made Mrs. Burr extremely angry, the more so as she had reason\nto think that her ever-youthful husband had been engaged in\nflirting with the country girls near the Jumel mansion.",
        "She was a woman of high spirit and had at times a violent temper.\nOne day the post-master at what was then the village of Harlem\nwas surprised to see Mrs. Burr drive up before the post-office in\nan open carriage. He came out to ask what she desired, and was\nsurprised to find her in a violent temper and with an enormous\nhorse-pistol on each cushion at her side.",
        "“What do you wish, madam?” said he, rather mildly.",
        "“What do I wish?” she cried. “Let me get at that villain Aaron\nBurr!”",
        "Presently Burr seems to have succeeded in pacifying her; but in\nthe end they separated, though she afterward always spoke most\nkindly of him. When he died, only about a year later, she is said\nto have burst into a flood of tears–another tribute to the\nfascination which Aaron Burr exercised through all his checkered\nlife.",
        "It is difficult to come to any fixed opinion regarding the moral\ncharacter of Aaron Burr. As a soldier he was brave to the point of\nrecklessness. As a political leader he was almost the equal of\nJefferson and quite superior to Hamilton. As a man of the world he\nwas highly accomplished, polished in manner, charming in\nconversation. He made friends easily, and he forgave his enemies\nwith a broadmindedness that is unusual.",
        "On the other hand, in his political career there was a touch of\ninsincerity, and it can scarcely be denied that he used his charm\ntoo often to the injury of those women who could not resist his\ninsinuating ways and the caressing notes of his rich voice. But as\na husband, in his youth, he was devoted, affectionate, and loyal;\nwhile as a father he was little less than worshiped by the\ndaughter whom he reared so carefully.",
        "One of his biographers very truly says that no such wretch as Burr\nhas been declared to be could have won and held the love of such a\nwife and such a daughter as Burr had.",
        "When all the other witnesses have been heard, let the two\nTheodosias be summoned, and especially that daughter who showed\ntoward him an affectionate veneration unsurpassed by any recorded\nin history or romance. Such an advocate as Theodosia the younger\nmust avail in some degree, even though the culprit were brought\nbefore the bar of Heaven itself.",
        "In the last decade of the eighteenth century England was perhaps\nthe most brilliant nation of the world. Other countries had been\nhumbled by the splendid armies of France and were destined to be\nstill further humbled by the emperor who came from Corsica. France\nhad begun to seize the scepter of power; yet to this picture there\nwas another side–fearful want and grievous poverty and the\nhorrors of the Revolution. Russia was too far away, and was still\nconsidered too barbarous, for a brilliant court to flourish there.\nPrussia had the prestige that Frederick the Great won for her, but\nshe was still a comparatively small state. Italy was in a\ncondition of political chaos; the banks of the Rhine were running\nblood where the Austrian armies faced the gallant Frenchmen under\nthe leadership of Moreau. But England, in spite of the loss of her\nAmerican colonies, was rich and prosperous, and her invincible\nfleets were extending her empire over the seven seas.",
        "At no time in modern England has the court at London seen so much\nreal splendor or such fine manners. The royalist emigres who fled\nfrom France brought with them names and pedigrees that were older\nthan the Crusades, and many of them were received with the\nfrankest, freest English hospitality. If here and there some\nmarquis or baron of ancient blood was perforce content to teach\nmusic to the daughters of tradesmen in suburban schools,\nnevertheless they were better off than they had been in France,\nharried by the savage gaze-hounds of the guillotine. Afterward,\nin the days of the Restoration, when they came back to their\nestates, they had probably learned more than one lesson from the\nbouledogues of Merry England, who had little tact, perhaps, but\nwho were at any rate kindly and willing to share their goods with\npinched and poverty-stricken foreigners.",
        "The court, then, as has been said, was brilliant with notables\nfrom Continental countries, and with the historic wealth of the\npeerage of England. Only one cloud overspread it; and that was the\nmental condition of the king. We have become accustomed to think\nof George III as a dull creature, almost always hovering on the\nverge of that insanity which finally swept him into a dark\nobscurity; but Thackeray’s picture of him is absurdly untrue to\nthe actual facts. George III. was by no means a dullard, nor was\nhe a sort of beefy country squire who roved about the palace\ngardens with his unattractive spouse.",
        "Obstinate enough he was, and ready for a combat with the rulers of\nthe Continent or with his self-willed sons; but he was a man of\nbrains and power, and Lord Rosebery has rightly described him as\nthe most striking constitutional figure of his time. Had he\nretained his reason, and had his erratic and self-seeking son not\nsucceeded him during his own lifetime, Great Britain might very\npossibly have entered upon other ways than those which opened to\nher after the downfall of Napoleon.",
        "The real center of fashionable England, however, was not George\nIII., but rather his son, subsequently George IV., who was made\nPrince of Wales three days after his birth, and who became prince\nregent during the insanity of the king. He was the leader of the\nsocial world, the fit companion of Beau Brummel and of a choice\ncircle of rakes and fox-hunters who drank pottle-deep. Some called\nhim “the first gentleman of Europe.” Others, who knew him better,\ndescribed him as one who never kept his word to man or woman and\nwho lacked the most elementary virtues.",
        "Yet it was his good luck during the first years of his regency to\nbe popular as few English kings have ever been. To his people he\ntypified old England against revolutionary France; and his youth\nand gaiety made many like him. He drank and gambled; he kept packs\nof hounds and strings of horses; he ran deeply into debt that he\nmight patronize the sports of that uproarious day. He was a\ngallant “Corinthian,” a haunter of dens where there were prize-\nfights and cock-fights, and there was hardly a doubtful resort in\nLondon where his face was not familiar.",
        "He was much given to gallantry–not so much, as it seemed, for\nwantonness, but from sheer love of mirth and chivalry. For a time,\nwith his chosen friends, such as Fox and Sheridan, he ventured\ninto reckless intrigues that recalled the amours of his\npredecessor, Charles II. He had by no means the wit and courage of\nCharles; and, indeed, the house of Hanover lacked the outward show\nof chivalry which made the Stuarts shine with external splendor.\nBut he was good-looking and stalwart, and when he had half a dozen\nrobust comrades by his side he could assume a very manly\nappearance. Such was George IV. in his regency and in his prime.\nHe made that period famous for its card-playing, its deep\ndrinking, and for the dissolute conduct of its courtiers and\nnoblemen no less than for the gallantry of its soldiers and its\nmomentous victories on sea and land. It came, however, to be seen\nthat his true achievements were in reality only escapades, that\nhis wit was only folly, and his so-called “sensibility” was but\nsham. He invented buckles, striped waistcoats, and flamboyant\ncollars, but he knew nothing of the principles of kingship or the\nlaws by which a state is governed.",
        "The fact that he had promiscuous affairs with women appealed at\nfirst to the popular sense of the romantic. It was not long,\nhowever, before these episodes were trampled down into the mire of\nvulgar scandal.",
        "One of the first of them began when he sent a letter, signed\n\"Florizel,” to a young actress, “Perdita” Robinson. Mrs. Robinson,\nwhose maiden name was Mary Darby, and who was the original of\nfamous portraits by Gainsborough and Reynolds, was a woman of\nbeauty, talent, and temperament. George, wishing in every way to\nbe “romantic,” insisted upon clandestine meetings on the Thames at\nKew, with all the stage trappings of the popular novels–cloaks,\nveils, faces hidden, and armed watchers to warn her of approaching\ndanger. Poor Perdita took this nonsense so seriously that she gave\nup her natural vocation for the stage, and forsook her husband,\nbelieving that the prince would never weary of her.",
        "He did weary of her very soon, and, with the brutality of a man of\nsuch a type, turned her away with the promise of some money; after\nwhich he cut her in the Park and refused to speak to her again. As\nfor the money, he may have meant to pay it, but Perdita had a long\nstruggle before she succeeded in getting it. It may be assumed\nthat the prince had to borrow it and that this obligation formed\npart of the debts which Parliament paid for him.",
        "It is not necessary to number the other women whose heads he\nturned. They are too many for remembrance here, and they have no\nspecial significance, save one who, as is generally believed,\nbecame his wife so far as the church could make her so. An act of\n1772 had made it illegal for any member of the English royal\nfamily to marry without the permission of the king. A marriage\ncontracted without the king’s consent might be lawful in the eyes\nof the church, but the children born of it could not inherit any\nclaim to the throne.",
        "It may be remarked here that this withholding of permission was\nstrictly enforced. Thus William IV., who succeeded George IV., was\nmarried, before his accession to the throne, to Mrs. Jordan\n(Dorothy Bland). Afterward he lawfully married a woman of royal\nbirth who was known as Queen Adelaide.",
        "There is an interesting story which tells how Queen Victoria came\nto be born because her father, the Duke of Kent, was practically\nforced to give up a morganatic union which he greatly preferred to\na marriage arranged for him by Parliament. Except the Duke of\nCambridge, the Duke of Kent was the only royal duke who was likely\nto have children in the regular line. The only daughter of George\nIV. had died in childhood. The Duke of Cumberland was for various\nreasons ineligible; the Duke of Clarence, later King William IV.,\nwas almost too old; and therefore, to insure the succession, the\nDuke of Kent was begged to marry a young and attractive woman, a\nprincess of the house of Saxe-Coburg, who was ready for the honor.\nIt was greatly to the Duke’s credit that he showed deep and\nsincere feeling in this matter. As he said himself in effect:",
        "“This French lady has stood by me in hard times and in good times,\ntoo–why should I cast her off? She has been more than a wife to\nme. And what do I care for your plans in Parliament? Send over for\none of the Stuarts–they are better men than the last lot of our\nfellows that you have had!”",
        "In the end, however, he was wearied out and was persuaded to\nmarry, but he insisted that a generous sum should be settled on\nthe lady who had been so long his true companion, and to whom, no\ndoubt, he gave many a wistful thought in his new but unfamiliar\nquarters in Kensington Palace, which was assigned as his\nresidence.",
        "Again, the second Duke of Cambridge, who died only a few years\nago, greatly desired to marry a lady who was not of royal rank,\nthough of fine breeding and of good birth. He besought his young\ncousin, as head of the family, to grant him this privilege of\nmarriage; but Queen Victoria stubbornly refused. The duke was\nmarried according to the rites of the church, but he could not\nmake his wife a duchess. The queen never quite forgave him for his\npartial defiance of her wishes, though the duke’s wife–she was\nusually spoken of as Mrs. FitzGeorge–was received almost\neverywhere, and two of her sons hold high rank in the British army\nand navy, respectively.",
        "The one real love story in the life of George IV. is that which\ntells of his marriage with a lady who might well have been the\nwife of any king. This was Maria Anne Smythe, better known as Mrs.\nFitzherbert, who was six years older than the young prince when\nshe first met him in company with a body of gentlemen and ladies\nin 1784.",
        "Maria Fitzherbert’s face was one which always displayed its best\nadvantages. Her eyes were peculiarly languishing, and, as she had\nalready been twice a widow, and was six years his senior, she had\nthe advantage over a less experienced lover. Likewise, she was a\nCatholic, and so by another act of Parliament any marriage with\nher would be illegal. Yet just because of all these different\nobjections the prince was doubly drawn to her, and was willing to\nsacrifice even the throne if he could but win her.",
        "His father, the king, called him into the royal presence and said:",
        "“George, it is time that you should settle down and insure the\nsuccession to the throne.”",
        "“Sir,” replied the prince, “I prefer to resign the succession and\nlet my brother have it, and that I should live as a private\nEnglish gentleman.”",
        "Mrs. Fitzherbert was not the sort of woman to give herself up\nreadily to a morganatic connection. Moreover, she soon came to\nlove Prince George too well to entangle him in a doubtful alliance\nwith one of another faith than his. Not long after he first met\nher the prince, who was always given to private theatricals, sent\nmessengers riding in hot haste to her house to tell her that he\nhad stabbed himself, that he begged to see her, and that unless\nshe came he would repeat the act. The lady yielded, and hurried to\nCarlton House, the prince’s residence; but she was prudent enough\nto take with her the Duchess of Devonshire, who was a reigning\nbeauty of the court.",
        "The scene which followed was theatrical rather than impressive.–\nThe prince was found in his sleeping-chamber, pale and with his\nruffles blood-stained. He played the part of a youthful and love-\nstricken wooer, vowing that he would marry the woman of his heart\nor stab himself again. In the presence of his messengers, who,\nwith the duchess, were witnesses, he formally took the lady as his\nwife, while Lady Devonshire’s wedding-ring sealed the troth. The\nprince also acknowledged it in a document.",
        "Mrs. Fitzherbert was, in fact, a woman of sound sense. Shortly\nafter this scene of melodramatic intensity her wits came back to\nher, and she recognized that she had merely gone through a\nmeaningless farce. So she sent back the prince’s document and the\nring and hastened to the Continent, where he could not reach her,\nalthough his detectives followed her steps for a year.",
        "At the last she yielded, however, and came home to marry the\nprince in such fashion as she could–a marriage of love, and\nsurely one of morality, though not of parliamentary law. The\nceremony was performed “in her own drawing-room in her house in\nLondon, in the presence of the officiating Protestant clergyman\nand two of her own nearest relatives.”",
        "Such is the serious statement of Lord Stourton, who was Mrs.\nFitzherbert’s cousin and confidant. The truth of it was never\ndenied, and Mrs. Fitzherbert was always treated with respect, and\neven regarded as a person of great distinction. Nevertheless, on\nmore than one occasion the prince had his friends in Parliament\ndeny the marriage in order that his debts might be paid and new\nallowances issued to him by the Treasury.",
        "George certainly felt himself a husband. Like any other married\nprince, he set himself to build a palace for his country home.\nWhile in search of some suitable spot he chanced to visit the\n\"pretty fishing-village” of Brighton to see his uncle, the Duke of\nCumberland. Doubtless he found it an attractive place, yet this\nmay have been not so much because of its view of the sea as for\nthe reason that Mrs. Fitzherbert had previously lived there.",
        "However, in 1784 the prince sent down his chief cook to make\narrangements for the next royal visit. The cook engaged a house on\nthe spot where the Pavilion now stands, and from that time\nBrighton began to be an extremely fashionable place. The court\ndoctors, giving advice that was agreeable, recommended their royal\npatient to take sea-bathing at Brighton. At once the place sprang\ninto popularity.",
        "At first the gentry were crowded into lodging-houses and the\naccommodations were primitive to a degree. But soon handsome\nvillas arose on every side; hotels appeared; places of amusement\nwere opened. The prince himself began to build a tasteless but\nshowy structure, partly Chinese and partly Indian in style, on the\nfashionable promenade of the Steyne.",
        "During his life with Mrs. Fitzherbert at Brighton the prince held\nwhat was practically a court. Hundreds of the aristocracy came\ndown from London and made their temporary dwellings there; while\nthousands who were by no means of the court made the place what is\nnow popularly called “London by the Sea.” There were the Duc de\nChartres, of France; statesmen and rakes, like Fox, Sheridan, and\nthe Earl of Barrymore; a very beautiful woman, named Mrs. Couch, a\nfavorite singer at the opera, to whom the prince gave at one time\njewels worth ten thousand pounds; and a sister of the Earl of\nBarrymore, who was as notorious as her brother. She often took the\npresident’s chair at a club which George’s friends had organized\nand which she had christened the Hell Fire Club.",
        "Such persons were not the only visitors at Brighton. Men of much\nmore serious demeanor came down to visit the prince and brought\nwith them quieter society. Nevertheless, for a considerable time\nthe place was most noted for its wild scenes of revelry, into\nwhich George frequently entered, though his home life with Mrs.\nFitzherbert at the Pavilion was a decorous one.",
        "No one felt any doubt as to the marriage of the two persons, who\nseemed so much like a prince and a princess. Some of the people of\nthe place addressed Mrs. Fitzherbert as “Mrs. Prince.” The old\nking and his wife, however, much deplored their son’s relation\nwith her. This was partly due to the fact that Mrs. Fitzherbert\nwas a Catholic and that she had received a number of French nuns\nwho had been driven out of France at the time of the Revolution.\nBut no less displeasure was caused by the prince’s racing and\ndicing, which swelled his debts to almost a million pounds, so\nthat Parliament and, indeed, the sober part of England were set\nagainst him.",
        "Of course, his marriage to Mrs. Fitzherbert had no legal status;\nnor is there any reason for believing that she ever became a\nmother. She had no children by her former two husbands, and Lord\nStourton testified positively that she never had either son or\ndaughter by Prince George. Nevertheless, more than one American\nclaimant has risen to advance some utterly visionary claim to the\nEnglish throne by reason of alleged descent from Prince George and\nMrs. Fitzherbert.",
        "Neither William IV. nor Queen Victoria ever spent much time at\nBrighton. In King William’s case it was explained that the\ndampness of the Pavilion did not suit him; and as to Queen\nVictoria, it was said that she disliked the fact that buildings\nhad been erected so as to cut off the view of the sea. It is quite\nlikely, however, that the queen objected to the associations of\nthe place, and did not care to be reminded of the time when her\nuncle had lived there so long in a morganatic state of marriage.",
        "At length the time came when the king, Parliament, and the people\nat large insisted that the Prince of Wales should make a legal\nmarriage, and a wife was selected for him in the person of\nCaroline, daughter of the Duke of Brunswick. This marriage took\nplace exactly ten years after his wedding with the beautiful and\ngentle-mannered Mrs. Fitzherbert. With the latter he had known\nmany days and hours of happiness. With Princess Caroline he had no\nhappiness at all.",
        "Prince George met her at the pier to greet her. It is said that as\nhe took her hand he kissed her, and then, suddenly recoiling, he\nwhispered to one of his friends:",
        "“For God’s sake, George, give me a glass of brandy!”",
        "Such an utterance was more brutal and barbaric than anything his\nbride could have conceived of, though it is probable, fortunately,\nthat she did not understand him by reason of her ignorance of\nEnglish.",
        "We need not go through the unhappy story of this unsympathetic,\nneglected, rebellious wife. Her life with the prince soon became\none of open warfare; but instead of leaving England she remained\nto set the kingdom in an uproar. As soon as his father died and he\nbecame king, George sued her for divorce. Half the people sided\nwith the queen, while the rest regarded her as a vulgar creature\nwho made love to her attendants and brought dishonor on the\nEnglish throne. It was a sorry, sordid contrast between the young\nPrince George who had posed as a sort of cavalier and this now\nfurious gray old man wrangling with his furious German wife.",
        "Well might he look back to the time when he met Perdita in the\nmoonlight on the Thames, or when he played the part of Florizel,\nor, better still, when he enjoyed the sincere and disinterested\nlove of the gentle woman who was his wife in all but legal status.\nCaroline of Brunswick was thrust away from the king’s coronation.\nShe took a house within sight of Westminster Abbey, so that she\nmight make hag-like screeches to the mob and to the king as he\npassed by. Presently, in August, 1821, only a month after the\ncoronation, she died, and her body was taken back to Brunswick for\nburial.",
        "George himself reigned for nine years longer. When he died in 1830\nhis executor was the Duke of Wellington. The duke, in examining\nthe late king’s private papers, found that he had kept with the\ngreatest care every letter written to him by his morganatic wife.\nDuring his last illness she had sent him an affectionate missive\nwhich it is said George “read eagerly.” Mrs. Fitzherbert wished\nthe duke to give up her letters; but he would do so only in return\nfor those which he had written to her.",
        "It was finally decided that it would be best to burn both his and\nhers. This work was carried out in Mrs. Fitzherbert’s own house by\nthe lady, the duke, and the Earl of Albemarle.",
        "Of George it may be said that he has left as memories behind him\nonly three things that will be remembered. The first is the\nPavilion at Brighton, with its absurdly oriental decorations, its\nminarets and flimsy towers. The second is the buckle which he\ninvented and which Thackeray has immortalized with his biting\nsatire. The last is the story of his marriage to Maria\nFitzherbert, and of the influence exercised upon him by the\naffection of a good woman.",
        "Perhaps some readers will consider this story inconsistent with\nthose that have preceded it. Yet, as it is little known to most\nreaders and as it is perhaps unique in the history of romantic\nlove, I cannot forbear relating it; for I believe that it is full\nof curious interest and pathetic power.",
        "All those who have written of the French Revolution have paused in\ntheir chronicle of blood and flame to tell the episode of the\npeasant Royalist, Charlotte Corday; but in telling it they have\noften omitted the one part of the story that is personal and not\npolitical. The tragic record of this French girl and her self-\nsacrifice has been told a thousand times by writers in many\nlanguages; yet almost all of them have neglected the brief romance\nwhich followed her daring deed and which was consummated after her\ndeath upon the guillotine. It is worth our while to speak first of\nCharlotte herself and of the man she slew, and then to tell that\nother tale which ought always to be entwined with her great deed\nof daring.",
        "Charlotte Corday–Marie Anne Charlotte Corday d’Armand–was a\nnative of Normandy, and was descended, as her name implies, from\nnoble ancestors. Her forefathers, indeed, had been statesmen,\ncivil rulers, and soldiers, and among them was numbered the famous\npoet Corneille, whom the French rank with Shakespeare. But a\ncentury or more of vicissitudes had reduced her branch of the\nfamily almost to the position of peasants–a fact which partly\njustifies the name that some give her when they call her “the\nJeanne d’Arc of the Revolution.”",
        "She did not, however, spend her girlish years amid the fields and\nwoods tending her sheep, as did the other Jeanne d’Arc; but she\nwas placed in charge of the sisters in a convent, and from them\nshe received such education as she had. She was a lonely child,\nand her thoughts turned inward, brooding over many things.",
        "After she had left the convent she was sent to live with an aunt.\nHere she devoted herself to reading over and over the few books\nwhich the house contained. These consisted largely of the deistic\nwriters, especially Voltaire, and to some extent they destroyed\nher convent faith, though it is not likely that she understood\nthem very fully.",
        "More to her taste was a copy of Plutarch’s Lives. These famous\nstories fascinated her. They told her of battle and siege, of\nintrigue and heroism, and of that romantic love of country which\nled men to throw away their lives for the sake of a whole people.\nBrutus and Regulus were her heroes. To die for the many seemed to\nher the most glorious end that any one could seek. When she\nthought of it she thrilled with a sort of ecstasy, and longed with\nall the passion of her nature that such a glorious fate might be\nher own.",
        "Charlotte had nearly come to womanhood at the time when the French\nRevolution first broke out. Royalist though she had been in her\nsympathies, she felt the justice of the people’s cause. She had\nseen the suffering of the peasantry, the brutality of the tax-\ngatherers, and all the oppression of the old regime. But what she\nhoped for was a democracy of order and equality and peace. Could\nthe king reign as a constitutional monarch rather than as a\ndespot, this was all for which she cared.",
        "In Normandy, where she lived, were many of those moderate\nrepublicans known as Girondists, who felt as she did and who hoped\nfor the same peaceful end to the great outbreak. On the other\nhand, in Paris, the party of the Mountain, as it was called, ruled\nwith a savage violence that soon was to culminate in the Reign of\nTerror. Already the guillotine ran red with noble blood. Already\nthe king had bowed his head to the fatal knife. Already the threat\nhad gone forth that a mere breath of suspicion or a pointed finger\nmight be enough to lead men and women to a gory death.",
        "In her quiet home near Caen Charlotte Corday heard as from afar\nthe story of this dreadful saturnalia of assassination which was\nmaking Paris a city of bloody mist. Men and women of the Girondist\nparty came to tell her of the hideous deeds that were perpetrated\nthere. All these horrors gradually wove themselves in the young\ngirl’s imagination around the sinister and repulsive figure of\nJean Paul Marat. She knew nothing of his associates, Danton and\nRobespierre. It was in Marat alone that she saw the monster who\nsent innocent thousands to their graves, and who reveled like some\narch-fiend in murder and gruesome death.",
        "In his earlier years Marat had been a very different figure–an\naccomplished physician, the friend of nobles, a man of science and\noriginal thought, so that he was nearly elected to the Academy of\nSciences. His studies in electricity gained for him the admiration\nof Benjamin Franklin and the praise of Goethe. But when he turned\nto politics he left all this career behind him. He plunged into\nthe very mire of red republicanism, and even there he was for a\ntime so much hated that he sought refuge in London to save his\nlife.",
        "On his return he was hunted by his enemies, so that his only place\nof refuge was in the sewers and drains of Paris. A woman, one\nSimonne Evrard, helped him to escape his pursuers. In the sewers,\nhowever, he contracted a dreadful skin-disease from which he never\nafterward recovered, and which was extremely painful as well as\nshocking to behold.",
        "It is small wonder that the stories about Marat circulated through\nthe provinces made him seem more a devil than a man. His\nvindictiveness against the Girondists brought all of this straight\nhome to Charlotte Corday and led her to dream of acting the part\nof Brutus, so that she might free her country from this hideous\ntyrant.",
        "In January, 1793, King Louis XVI. met his death upon the scaffold;\nand the queen was thrust into a foul prison. This was a signal for\nactivity among the Girondists in Normandy, and especially at Caen,\nwhere Charlotte was present at their meetings and heard their\nfervid oratory. There was a plot to march on Paris, yet in some\ninstinctive way she felt that such a scheme must fail. It was then\nthat she definitely formed the plan of going herself, alone, to\nthe French capital to seek out the hideous Marat and to kill him\nwith her own hands.",
        "To this end she made application for a passport allowing her to\nvisit Paris. This passport still exists, and it gives us an\nofficial description of the girl. It reads:",
        "Allow citizen Marie Corday to pass. She is twenty-four years of\nage, five feet and one inch in height, hair and eyebrows chestnut\ncolor, eyes gray, forehead high, mouth medium size, chin dimpled,\nand an oval face.",
        "Apart from this verbal description we have two portraits painted\nwhile she was in prison. Both of them make the description of the\npassport seem faint and pale. The real Charlotte had a wealth of\nchestnut hair which fell about her face and neck in glorious\nabundance. Her great gray eyes spoke eloquently of truth and\ncourage. Her mouth was firm yet winsome, and her form combined\nboth strength and grace. Such is the girl who, on reaching Paris,\nwrote to Marat in these words:",
        "Citizen, I have just arrived from Caen. Your love for your native\nplace doubtless makes you wish to learn the events which have\noccurred in that part of the republic. I shall call at your\nresidence in about an hour. Be so good as to receive me and give\nme a brief interview. I will put you in such condition as to\nrender great service to France.",
        "This letter failed to gain her admission, and so did another which\nshe wrote soon after. The fact is that Marat was grievously ill.\nHis disease had reached a point where the pain could be assuaged\nonly by hot water; and he spent the greater part of his time\nwrapped in a blanket and lying in a large tub.",
        "A third time, however, the persistent girl called at his house and\ninsisted that she must see him, saying that she was herself in\ndanger from the enemies of the Republic. Through an open door\nMarat heard her mellow voice and gave orders that she should be\nadmitted.",
        "As she entered she gazed for a moment upon the lank figure rolling\nin the tub, the rat-like face, and the shifting eyes. Then she\napproached him, concealing in the bosom of her dress a long\ncarving-knife which she had purchased for two francs. In answer to\nMarat’s questioning look she told him that there was much\nexcitement at Caen and that the Girondists were plotting there.",
        "To this Marat answered, in his harsh voice:",
        "“All these men you mention shall be guillotined in the next few\ndays!”",
        "As he spoke Charlotte flashed out the terrible knife and with all\nher strength she plunged it into his left side, where it pierced a\nlung and a portion of his heart.",
        "Marat, with the blood gushing from his mouth, cried out:",
        "“Help, darling!”",
        "His cry was meant for one of the two women in the house. Both\nheard it, for they were in the next room; and both of them rushed\nin and succeeded in pinioning Charlotte Corday, who, indeed, made\nonly a slight effort to escape. Troops were summoned, she was\ntaken to the Prison de l’Abbaye, and soon after she was arraigned\nbefore the revolutionary tribunal.",
        "Placed in the dock, she glanced about her with an air of pride, as\nof one who gloried in the act which she had just performed. A\nwritten charge was read. She was asked what she had to say.\nLifting her head with a look of infinite satisfaction, she\nanswered in a ringing voice:",
        "“Nothing–except that I succeeded!”",
        "A lawyer was assigned for her defense. He pleaded for her\nearnestly, declaring that she must he regarded as insane; but\nthose clear, calm eyes and that gentle face made her sanity a\nmatter of little doubt. She showed her quick wit in the answers\nwhich she gave to the rough prosecutor, Fouquier-Tinville, who\ntried to make her confess that she had accomplices.",
        "“Who prompted you to do this deed?” roared Tinville.",
        "“I needed no prompting. My own heart was sufficient.”",
        "“In what, then, had Marat wronged you?”",
        "“He was a savage beast who was going to destroy the remains of\nFrance in the fires of civil war.”",
        "“But whom did you expect to benefit?” insinuated the prosecutor.",
        "“I have killed one man to save a hundred thousand.”",
        "“What? Did you imagine that you had murdered all the Marats?”",
        "“No, but, this one being dead, the rest will perhaps take\nwarning.”",
        "Thus her directness baffled all the efforts of the prosecution to\ntrap her into betraying any of her friends. The court, however,\nsentenced her to death. She was then immured in the Conciergerie.",
        "This dramatic court scene was the beginning of that strange, brief\nromance to which one can scarcely find a parallel. At the time\nthere lived in Paris a young German named Adam Lux. The continual\ntalk about Charlotte Corday had filled him with curiosity\nregarding this young girl who had been so daring and so patriotic.\nShe was denounced on every hand as a murderess with the face of a\nMedusa and the muscles of a Vulcan. Street songs about her were\ndinned into the ears of Adam Lux.",
        "As a student of human nature he was anxious to see this terrible\ncreature. He forced his way to the front of the crowded benches in\nthe court-room and took his stand behind a young artist who was\nfinishing a beautiful sketch. From that moment until the end of\nthe trial the eyes of Adam Lux were fastened on the prisoner. What\na contrast to the picture he had imagined!",
        "A mass of regal chestnut hair crowned with the white cap of a\nNorman peasant girl; gray eyes, very sad and serious, but looking\nserenely forth from under long, dark lashes; lips slightly curved\nwith an expression of quiet humor; a face the color of the sun and\nwind, a bust indicative of perfect health, the chin of a Caesar,\nand the whole expression one of almost divine self-sacrifice. Such\nwere the features that the painter was swiftly putting upon his\ncanvas; but behind them Adam Lux discerned the soul for which he\ngladly sacrificed both his liberty and his life.",
        "He forgot his surroundings and seemed to see only that beautiful,\npure face and to hear only the exquisite cadences of the wonderful\nvoice. When Charlotte was led forth by a file of soldiers Adam\nstaggered from the scene and made his way as best he might to his\nlodgings. There he lay prostrate, his whole soul filled with the\nlove of her who had in an instant won the adoration of his heart.",
        "Once, and only once again, when the last scene opened on the\ntragedy, did he behold the heroine of his dreams.",
        "On the 17th of July Charlotte Corday was taken from her prison to\nthe gloomy guillotine. It was toward evening, and nature had given\na setting fit for such an end. Blue-black thunder-clouds rolled in\nhuge masses across the sky until their base appeared to rest on\nthe very summit of the guillotine. Distant thunder rolled and\ngrumbled beyond the river. Great drops of rain fell upon the\nsoldiers’ drums. Young, beautiful, unconscious of any wrong,\nCharlotte Corday stood beneath the shadow of the knife.",
        "At the supreme moment a sudden ray from the setting sun broke\nthrough the cloud-wrack and fell upon her slender figure until she\nglowed in the eyes of the startled spectators like a statue cut in\nburnished bronze. Thus illumined, as it were, by a light from\nheaven itself, she bowed herself beneath the knife and paid the\npenalty of a noble, if misdirected, impulse. As the blade fell her\nlips quivered with her last and only plea:",
        "“My duty is enough–the rest is nothing!”",
        "Adam Lux rushed from the scene a man transformed. He bore graven\nupon his heart neither the mob of tossing red caps nor the glare\nof the sunset nor the blood-stained guillotine, but that last look\nfrom those brilliant eyes. The sight almost deprived him of his\nreason. The self-sacrifice of the only woman he had ever loved,\neven though she had never so much as seen him, impelled him with a\nsort of fury to his own destruction.",
        "He wrote a bitter denunciation of the judges, of the officers, and\nof all who had been followers of Marat. This document he printed,\nand scattered copies of it through every quarter in Paris. The\nlast sentences are as follows:",
        "The guillotine is no longer a disgrace. It has become a sacred\naltar, from which every taint has been removed by the innocent\nblood shed there on the 17th of July. Forgive me, my divine\nCharlotte, if I find it impossible at the last moment to show the\ncourage and the gentleness that were yours! I glory because you\nare superior to me, for it is right that she who is adored should\nbe higher and more glorious than her adorer!",
        "This pamphlet, spread broadcast among the people, was soon\nreported to the leaders of the rabble. Adam Lux was arrested for\ntreason against the Republic; but even these men had no desire to\nmake a martyr of this hot-headed youth. They would stop his mouth\nwithout taking his life. Therefore he was tried and speedily found\nguilty, but an offer was made him that he might have passports\nthat would allow him to return to Germany if only he would sign a\nretraction of his printed words.",
        "Little did the judges understand the fiery heart of the man they\nhad to deal with. To die on the same scaffold as the woman whom he\nhad idealized was to him the crowning triumph of his romantic\nlove. He gave a prompt and insolent refusal to their offer. He\nswore that if released he would denounce his darling’s murderers\nwith a still greater passion.",
        "In anger the tribunal sentenced him to death. Only then he smiled\nand thanked his judges courteously, and soon after went blithely\nto the guillotine like a bridegroom to his marriage feast.",
        "Adam Lux! Spirit courtship had been carried on silently all\nthrough that terrible cross-examination of Charlotte Corday. His\nheart was betrothed to hers in that single gleam of the setting\nsun when she bowed beneath the knife. One may believe that these\ntwo souls were finally united when the same knife fell sullenly\nupon his neck and when his life-blood sprinkled the altar that was\nstill stained with hers.",
        "There are four women who may be said to have deeply influenced the\nlife of Napoleon. These four are the only ones who need to be\ntaken into account by the student of his imperial career. The\ngreat emperor was susceptible to feminine charms at all times; but\njust as it used to be said of him that “his smile never rose above\nhis eyes,” so it might as truly be said that in most instances the\nthrobbing of his heart did not affect his actions.",
        "Women to him were the creatures of the moment, although he might\nseem to care for them and to show his affection in extravagant\nways, as in his affair with Mlle. Georges, the beautiful but\nrather tiresome actress. As for Mme. de Stael, she bored him to\ndistraction by her assumption of wisdom. That was not the kind of\nwoman that Napoleon cared for. He preferred that a woman should be\nwomanly, and not a sort of owl to sit and talk with him about the\ntheory of government.",
        "When it came to married women they interested him only because of\nthe children they might bear to grow up as recruits for his\ninsatiate armies. At the public balls given at the Tuileries he\nwould walk about the gorgeous drawing-rooms, and when a lady was\npresented to him he would snap out, sharply:",
        "“How many children have you?”",
        "If she were able to answer that she had several the emperor would\nlook pleased and would pay her some compliment; but if she said\nthat she had none he would turn upon her sharply and say:",
        "“Then go home and have some!”",
        "Of the four women who influenced his life, first must come\nJosephine, because she secured him his earliest chance of\nadvancement. She met him through Barras, with whom she was said to\nbe rather intimate. The young soldier was fascinated by her–the\nmore because she was older than he and possessed all the practised\narts of the creole and the woman of the world. When she married\nhim she brought him as her dowry the command of the army of Italy,\nwhere in a few months he made the tri-color, borne by ragged\ntroops, triumphant over the splendidly equipped hosts of Austria.",
        "She was his first love, and his knowledge of her perfidy gave him\nthe greatest shock and horror of his whole life; yet she might\nhave held him to the end if she had borne an heir to the imperial\nthrone. It was her failure to do so that led Napoleon to divorce\nJosephine and marry the thick-lipped Marie Louise of Austria.\nThere were times later when he showed signs of regret and said:",
        "“I have had no luck since I gave up Josephine!”",
        "Marie Louise was of importance for a time–the short time when\nshe entertained her husband and delighted him by giving birth to\nthe little King of Rome. Yet in the end she was but an episode;\nfleeing from her husband in his misfortune, becoming the mistress\nof Count Neipperg, and letting her son–l’Aiglon–die in a land\nthat was far from France.",
        "Napoleon’s sister, Pauline Bonaparte, was the third woman who\ncomes to mind when we contemplate the great Corsican’s career.\nShe, too, is an episode. During the period of his ascendancy she\nplagued him with her wanton ways, her sauciness and trickery. It\nwas amusing to throw him into one of his violent rages; but\nPauline was true at heart, and when her great brother was sent to\nElba she followed him devotedly and gave him all her store of\njewels, including the famous Borghese diamonds, perhaps the most\nsuperb of all gems known to the western world. She would gladly\nhave followed him, also, to St. Helena had she been permitted.\nRemaining behind, she did everything possible in conspiring to\nsecure his freedom.",
        "But, after all, Pauline and Marie Louise count for comparatively\nlittle. Josephine’s fate was interwoven with Napoleon’s; and, with\nhis Corsican superstition, he often said so. The fourth woman, of\nwhom I am writing here, may be said to have almost equaled\nJosephine in her influence on the emperor as well as in the pathos\nof her life-story.",
        "On New-Year’s Day of 1807 Napoleon, who was then almost Emperor of\nEurope, passed through the little town of Bronia, in Poland.\nRiding with his cavalry to Warsaw, the ancient capital of the\nPolish kingdom, he seemed a very demigod of battle.",
        "True, he had had to abandon his long-cherished design of invading\nand overrunning England, and Nelson had shattered his fleets and\npractically driven his flag from the sea; but the naval disaster\nof Trafalgar had speedily been followed by the triumph of\nAusterlitz, the greatest and most brilliant of all Napoleon’s\nvictories, which left Austria and Russia humbled to the very\nground before him.",
        "Then Prussia had dared to defy the over-bearing conqueror and had\nput into the field against him her armies trained by Frederick the\nGreat; but these he had shattered almost at a stroke, winning in\none day the decisive battles of Jena and Auerstadt. He had stabled\nhis horses in the royal palace of the Hohenzollerns and had\npursued the remnant of the Prussian forces to the Russian border.",
        "As he marched into the Polish provinces the people swarmed by\nthousands to meet him and hail him as their country’s savior. They\nbelieved down to the very last that Bonaparte would make the Poles\nonce more a free and independent nation and rescue them from the\ntyranny of Russia.",
        "Napoleon played upon this feeling in every manner known to his\nartful mind. He used it to alarm the Czar. He used it to\nintimidate the Emperor of Austria; but more especially did he use\nit among the Poles themselves to win for his armies thousands upon\nthousands of gallant soldiers, who believed that in fighting for\nNapoleon they were fighting for the final independence of their\nnative land.",
        "Therefore, with the intensity of patriotism which is a passion\namong the Poles, every man and every woman gazed at Napoleon with\nsomething like adoration; for was not he the mighty warrior who\nhad in his gift what all desired? Soldiers of every rank swarmed\nto his standards. Princes and nobles flocked about him. Those who\nstayed at home repeated wonderful stories of his victories and\nprayed for him and fed the flame which spread through all the\ncountry. It was felt that no sacrifice was too great to win his\nfavor; that to him, as to a deity, everything that he desired\nshould be yielded up, since he was to restore the liberty of\nPoland.",
        "And hence, when the carriage of the emperor dashed into Bronia,\nsurrounded by Polish lancers and French cuirassiers, the enormous\ncrowd surged forward and blocked the way so that their hero could\nnot pass because of their cheers and cries and supplications.",
        "In the midst of it all there came a voice of peculiar sweetness\nfrom the thickest portion of the crowd.",
        "“Please let me pass!” said the voice. “Let me see him, if only for\na moment!”",
        "The populace rolled backward, and through the lane which they made\na beautiful girl with dark blue eyes that flamed and streaming\nhair that had become loosened about her radiant face was\nconfronting the emperor. Carried away by her enthusiasm, she\ncried:",
        "“Thrice welcome to Poland! We can do or say nothing to express our\njoy in the country which you will surely deliver from its tyrant.”",
        "The emperor bowed and, with a smile, handed a great bouquet of\nroses to the girl, for her beauty and her enthusiasm had made a\ndeep impression on him.",
        "“Take it,” said he, “as a proof of my admiration. I trust that I\nmay have the pleasure of meeting you at Warsaw and of hearing your\nthanks from those beautiful lips.”",
        "In a moment more the trumpets rang out shrilly, the horsemen\nclosed up beside the imperial carriage, and it rolled away amid\nthe tumultuous shouting of the populace.",
        "The girl who had so attracted Napoleon’s attention was Marie\nWalewska, descended from an ancient though impoverished family in\nPoland. When she was only fifteen she was courted by one of the\nwealthiest men in Poland, the Count Walewska. He was three or four\ntimes her age, yet her dark blue eyes, her massive golden hair,\nand the exquisite grace of her figure led him to plead that she\nmight become his wife. She had accepted him, but the marriage was\nthat of a mere child, and her interest still centered upon her\ncountry and took the form of patriotism rather than that of\nwifehood and maternity.",
        "It was for this reason that the young Countess had visited Bronia.\nShe was now eighteen years of age and still had the sort of\nromantic feeling which led her to think that she would keep in\nsome secret hiding-place the bouquet which the greatest man alive\nhad given her.",
        "But Napoleon was not the sort of man to forget anything that had\ngiven him either pleasure or the reverse. He who, at the height of\nhis cares, could recall instantly how many cannon were in each\nseaport of France and could make out an accurate list of all his\nmilitary stores; he who could call by name every soldier in his\nguard, with a full remembrance of the battles each man had fought\nin and the honors that he had won–he was not likely to forget so\nlovely a face as the one which had gleamed with peculiar radiance\nthrough the crowd at Bronia.",
        "On reaching Warsaw he asked one or two well-informed persons about\nthis beautiful stranger. Only a few hours had passed before Prince\nPoniatowski, accompanied by other nobles, called upon her at her\nhome.",
        "“I am directed, madam,” said he, “by order of the Emperor of\nFrance, to bid you to be present at a ball that is to be given in\nhis honor to-morrow evening.”",
        "Mme. Walewska was startled, and her face grew hot with blushes.\nDid the emperor remember her escapade at Bronia? If so, how had he\ndiscovered her? Why should he seek her out and do her such an\nhonor?",
        "“That, madam, is his imperial majesty’s affair,” Poniatowski told\nher. “I merely obey his instructions and ask your presence at the\nball. Perhaps Heaven has marked you out to be the means of saving\nour unhappy country.”",
        "In this way, by playing on her patriotism, Poniatowski almost\npersuaded her, and yet something held her back. She trembled,\nthough she was greatly fascinated; and finally she refused to go.",
        "Scarcely had the envoy left her, however, when a great company of\nnobles entered in groups and begged her to humor the emperor.\nFinally her own husband joined in their entreaties and actually\ncommanded her to go; so at last she was compelled to yield.",
        "It was by no means the frank and radiant girl who was now\npreparing again to meet the emperor. She knew not why, and yet her\nheart was full of trepidation and nervous fright, the cause of\nwhich she could not guess, yet which made her task a severe\nordeal. She dressed herself in white satin, with no adornment save\na wreath of foliage in her hair.",
        "As she entered the ballroom she was welcomed by hundreds whom she\nhad never seen before, but who were of the highest nobility of\nPoland. Murmurs of admiration followed her, and finally\nPoniatowski came to her and complimented her, besides bringing her\na message that the emperor desired her to dance with him.",
        "“I am very sorry,” she said, with a quiver of the lips, “but I\nreally cannot dance. Be kind enough to ask the emperor to excuse\nme.”",
        "But at that very moment she felt some strange magnetic influence;\nand without looking up she could feel that Napoleon himself was\nstanding by her as she sat with blanched face and downcast eyes,\nnot daring to look up at him.",
        "“White upon white is a mistake, madam,” said the emperor, in his\ngentlest tones. Then, stooping low, he whispered, “I had expected\na far different reception.”",
        "She neither smiled nor met his eyes. He stood there for a moment\nand then passed on, leaving her to return to her home with a heavy\nheart. The young countess felt that she had acted wrongly, and yet\nthere was an instinct–an instinct that she could not conquer.",
        "In the gray of the morning, while she was still tossing\nfeverishly, her maid knocked at the door and brought her a hastily\nscribbled note. It ran as follows:",
        "I saw none but you, I admired none but you; I desire only you.\nAnswer at once, and calm the impatient ardor of–N.",
        "These passionate words burned from her eyes the veil that had\nhidden the truth from her. What before had been mere blind\ninstinct became an actual verity. Why had she at first rushed\nforth into the very streets to hail the possible deliverer of her\ncountry, and then why had she shrunk from him when he sought to\nhonor her! It was all clear enough now. This bedside missive meant\nthat he had intended her dishonor and that he had looked upon her\nsimply as a possible mistress.",
        "At once she crushed the note angrily in her hand.",
        "“There is no answer at all,” said she, bursting into bitter tears\nat the very thought that he should dare to treat her in this way.",
        "But on the following morning when she awoke her maid was standing\nbeside her with a second letter from Napoleon. She refused to open\nit and placed it in a packet with the first letter, and ordered\nthat both of them should be returned to the emperor.",
        "She shrank from speaking to her husband of what had happened, and\nthere was no one else in whom she dared confide. All through that\nday there came hundreds of visitors, either of princely rank or\nmen who had won fame by their gallantry and courage. They all\nbegged to see her, but to them all she sent one answer–that she\nwas ill and could see no one.",
        "After a time her husband burst into her room, and insisted that\nshe should see them.",
        "“Why,” exclaimed he, “you are insulting the greatest men and the\nnoblest women of Poland! More than that, there are some of the\nmost distinguished Frenchmen sitting at your doorstep, as it were.\nThere is Duroc, grand marshal of France, and in refusing to see\nhim you are insulting the great emperor on whom depends everything\nthat our country longs for. Napoleon has invited you to a state\ndinner and you have given him no answer whatever. I order you to\nrise at once and receive these ladies and gentlemen who have done\nyou so much honor!”",
        "She could not refuse. Presently she appeared in her drawing-room,\nwhere she was at once surrounded by an immense throng of her own\ncountrymen and countrywomen, who made no pretense of\nmisunderstanding the situation. To them, what was one woman’s\nhonor when compared with the freedom and independence of their\nnation? She was overwhelmed by arguments and entreaties. She was\neven accused of being disloyal to the cause of Poland if she\nrefused her consent.",
        "One of the strangest documents of that period was a letter sent to\nher and signed by the noblest men in Poland. It contained a\npowerful appeal to her patriotism. One remarkable passage even\nquotes the Bible to point out her line of duty. A portion of this\nletter ran as follows:",
        "Did Esther, think you, give herself to Ahasuerus out of the\nfulness of her love for him? So great was the terror with which he\ninspired her that she fainted at the sight of him. We may\ntherefore conclude that affection had but little to do with her\nresolve. She sacrificed her own inclinations to the salvation of\nher country, and that salvation it was her glory to achieve. May\nwe be enabled to say the same of you, to your glory and our own\nhappiness!",
        "After this letter came others from Napoleon himself, full of the\nmost humble pleading. It was not wholly distasteful thus to have\nthe conqueror of the world seek her out and offer her his\nadoration any more than it was distasteful to think that the\nrevival of her own nation depended on her single will. M. Frederic\nMasson, whose minute studies regarding everything relating to\nNapoleon have won him a seat in the French Academy, writes of\nMarie Walewska at this time: Every force was now brought into play\nagainst her. Her country, her friends, her religion, the Old and\nthe New Testaments, all urged her to yield; they all combined for\nthe ruin of a simple and inexperienced girl of eighteen who had no\nparents, whose husband even thrust her into temptation, and whose\nfriends thought that her downfall would be her glory.",
        "Amid all these powerful influences she consented to attend the\ndinner. To her gratification Napoleon treated her with distant\ncourtesy, and, in fact, with a certain coldness.",
        "“I heard that Mme. Walewska was indisposed. I trust that she has\nrecovered,” was all the greeting that he gave her when they met.",
        "Every one else with whom she spoke overwhelmed her with flattery\nand with continued urging; but the emperor himself for a time\nacted as if she had displeased him. This was consummate art; for\nas soon as she was relieved of her fears she began to regret that\nshe had thrown her power away.",
        "During the dinner she let her eyes wander to those of the emperor\nalmost in supplication. He, the subtlest of men, knew that he had\nwon. His marvelous eyes met hers and drew her attention to him as\nby an electric current; and when the ladies left the great dining-\nroom Napoleon sought her out and whispered in her ear a few words\nof ardent love.",
        "It was too little to alarm her seriously now. It was enough to\nmake her feel that magnetism which Napoleon knew so well how to\nevoke and exercise. Again every one crowded about her with\ncongratulations. Some said:",
        "“He never even saw any of US. His eyes were all for YOU! They\nflashed fire as he looked at you.”",
        "“You have conquered his heart,” others said, “and you can do what\nyou like with him. The salvation of Poland is in your hands.”",
        "The company broke up at an early hour, but Mme. Walewska was asked\nto remain. When she was alone General Duroc–one of the emperor’s\nfavorite officers and most trusted lieutenants–entered and placed\na letter from Napoleon in her lap. He tried to tell her as\ntactfully as possible how much harm she was doing by refusing the\nimperial request. She was deeply affected, and presently, when\nDuroc left her, she opened the letter which he had given her and\nread it. It was worded thus:",
        "There are times when all splendors become oppressive, as I feel\nbut too deeply at the present moment. How can I satisfy the\ndesires of a heart that yearns to cast itself at your feet, when\nits impulses are checked at every point by considerations of the\nhighest moment? Oh, if you would, you alone might overcome the\nobstacles that keep us apart. MY FRIEND DUROC WILL MAKE ALL EASY\nFOR YOU. Oh, come, come! Your every wish shall be gratified! Your\ncountry will be dearer to me when you take pity on my poor heart.\nN.",
        "Every chance of escape seemed to be closed. She had Napoleon’s own\nword that he would free Poland in return for her self-sacrifice.\nMoreover, her powers of resistance had been so weakened that, like\nmany women, she temporized. She decided that she would meet the\nemperor alone. She would tell him that she did not love him, and\nyet would plead with him to save her beloved country.",
        "As she sat there every tick of the clock stirred her to a new\nexcitement. At last there came a knock upon the door, a cloak was\nthrown about her from behind, a heavy veil was drooped about her\ngolden hair, and she was led, by whom she knew not, to the street,\nwhere a finely appointed carriage was waiting for her.",
        "No sooner had she entered it than she was driven rapidly through\nthe darkness to the beautifully carved entrance of a palace. Half\nled, half carried, she was taken up the steps to a door which was\neagerly opened by some one within. There were warmth and light and\ncolor and the scent of flowers as she was placed in a comfortable\narm-chair. Her wrappings were taken from her, the door was closed\nbehind her; and then, as she looked up, she found herself in the\npresence of Napoleon, who was kneeling at her feet and uttering\nsoothing words.",
        "Wisely, the emperor used no violence. He merely argued with her;\nhe told her over and over his love for her; and finally he\ndeclared that for her sake he would make Poland once again a\nstrong and splendid kingdom.",
        "Several hours passed. In the early morning, before daylight, there\ncame a knock at the door.",
        "“Already?” said Napoleon. “Well, my plaintive dove, go home and\nrest. You must not fear the eagle. In time you will come to love\nhim, and in all things you shall command him.”",
        "Then he led her to the door, but said that he would not open it\nunless she promised to see him the next day–a promise which she\ngave the more readily because he had treated her with such\nrespect.",
        "On the following morning her faithful maid came to her bedside\nwith a cluster of beautiful violets, a letter, and several\ndaintily made morocco cases. When these were opened there leaped\nout strings and necklaces of exquisite diamonds, blazing in the\nmorning sunlight. Mme. Walewska seized the jewels and flung them\nacross the room with an order that they should be taken back at\nonce to the imperial giver; but the letter, which was in the same\nromantic strain as the others, she retained.",
        "On that same evening there was another dinner, given to the\nemperor by the nobles, and Marie Walewska attended it, but of\ncourse without the diamonds, which she had returned. Nor did she\nwear the flowers which had accompanied the diamonds.",
        "When Napoleon met her he frowned upon her and made her tremble\nwith the cold glances that shot from his eyes of steel. He\nscarcely spoke to her throughout the meal, but those who sat\nbeside her were earnest in their pleading.",
        "Again she waited until the guests had gone away, and with a\nlighter heart, since she felt that she had nothing to fear. But\nwhen she met Napoleon in his private cabinet, alone, his mood was\nvery different from that which he had shown before. Instead of\ngentleness and consideration he was the Napoleon of camps, and not\nof courts. He greeted her bruskly.",
        "“I scarcely expected to see you again,” said he. “Why did you\nrefuse my diamonds and my flowers? Why did you avoid my eyes at\ndinner? Your coldness is an insult which I shall not brook.” Then\nhe raised his voice to that rasping, almost blood-curdling tone\nwhich even his hardiest soldiers dreaded: “I will have you know\nthat I mean to conquer you. You SHALL–yes, I repeat it, you\nSHALL love me! I have restored the name of your country. It owes\nits very existence to me.”",
        "Then he resorted to a trick which he had played years before in\ndealing with the Austrians at Campo Formio.",
        "“See this watch which I am holding in my hand. Just as I dash it\nto fragments before you, so will I shatter Poland if you drive me\nto desperation by rejecting my heart and refusing me your own.”",
        "As he spoke he hurled the watch against the opposite wall with\nterrific force, dashing it to pieces. In terror, Mme. Walewska\nfainted. When she resumed consciousness there was Napoleon wiping\naway her tears with the tenderness of a woman and with words of\nself-reproach.",
        "The long siege was over. Napoleon had conquered, and this girl of\neighteen gave herself up to his caresses and endearments, thinking\nthat, after all, her love of country was more than her own honor.",
        "Her husband, as a matter of form, put her away from him, though at\nheart he approved what she had done, while the Polish people\nregarded her as nothing less than a national heroine. To them she\nwas no minister to the vices of an emperor, but rather one who\nwould make him love Poland for her sake and restore its greatness.",
        "So far as concerned his love for her, it was, indeed, almost\nidolatry. He honored her in every way and spent all the time at\nhis disposal in her company. But his promise to restore Poland he\nnever kept, and gradually she found that he had never meant to\nkeep it.",
        "“I love your country,” he would say, “and I am willing to aid in\nthe attempt to uphold its rights, but my first duty is to France.\nI cannot shed French blood in a foreign cause.”",
        "By this time, however, Marie Walewska had learned to love Napoleon\nfor his own sake. She could not resist his ardor, which matched\nthe ardor of the Poles themselves. Moreover, it flattered her to\nsee the greatest soldier in the world a suppliant for her smiles.",
        "For some years she was Napoleon’s close companion, spending long\nhours with him and finally accompanying him to Paris. She was the\nmother of Napoleon’s only son who lived to manhood. This son, who\nbore the name of Alexandre Florian de Walewski, was born in Poland\nin 1810, and later was created a count and duke of the second\nFrench Empire. It may be said parenthetically that he was a man of\ngreat ability. Living down to 1868, he was made much of by\nNapoleon III., who placed him in high offices of state, which he\nfilled with distinction. In contrast with the Duc de Morny, who\nwas Napoleon’s illegitimate half-brother, Alexandre de Walewski\nstood out in brilliant contrast. He would have nothing to do with\nstock-jobbing and unseemly speculation.",
        "“I may be poor,” he said–though he was not poor–\"but at least I\nremember the glory of my father and what is due to his great\nname.”",
        "As for Mme. Walewska, she was loyal to the emperor, and lacked the\ngreed of many women whom he had made his favorites. Even at Elba,\nwhen he was in exile and disgrace, she visited him that she might\nendeavor to console him. She was his counselor and friend as well\nas his earnestly loved mate. When she died in Paris in 1817, while\nthe dethroned emperor was a prisoner at St. Helena, the word\n\"Napoleon” was the last upon her lips.",
        "It was said of Napoleon long ago that he could govern emperors and\nkings, but that not even he could rule his relatives. He himself\nonce declared:",
        "“My family have done me far more harm than I have been able to do\nthem good.”",
        "It would be an interesting historical study to determine just how\nfar the great soldier’s family aided in his downfall by their\nselfishness, their jealousy, their meanness, and their\ningratitude.",
        "There is something piquant in thinking of Napoleon as a domestic\nsort of person. Indeed, it is rather difficult to do so. When we\nspeak his name we think of the stern warrior hurling his armies up\nbloody slopes and on to bloody victory. He is the man whose steely\neyes made his haughtiest marshals tremble, or else the wise, far-\nseeing statesman and lawgiver; but decidedly he is not a household\nmodel. We read of his sharp speech to women, of his outrageous\nmanners at the dinner-table, and of the thousand and one details\nwhich Mme. de Remusat has chronicled–and perhaps in part\ninvented, for there has always existed the suspicion that her\nanimus was that of a woman who had herself sought the imperial\nfavor and had failed to win it.",
        "But, in fact, all these stories relate to the Napoleon of courts\nand palaces, and not to the Napoleon of home. In his private life\nthis great man was not merely affectionate and indulgent, but he\neven showed a certain weakness where his relatives were concerned,\nso that he let them prey upon him almost without end.",
        "He had a great deal of the Italian largeness and lavishness of\ncharacter with his family. When a petty officer he nearly starved\nhimself in order to give his younger brother, Louis, a military\neducation. He was devotedly fond of children, and they were fond\nof him, as many anecdotes attest. His passionate love for\nJosephine before he learned of her infidelity is almost painful to\nread of; and even afterward, when he had been disillusioned, and\nwhen she was paying Fouche a thousand francs a day to spy upon\nNapoleon’s every action, he still treated her with friendliness\nand allowed her extravagance to embarrass him.",
        "He made his eldest brother, Joseph, King of Spain, and Spain\nproved almost as deadly to him as did Russia. He made his youngest\nbrother, Jerome, King of Westphalia, and Jerome turned the palace\ninto a pigsty and brought discredit on the very name of Bonaparte.\nHis brother Louis, for whom he had starved himself, he placed upon\nthe throne of Holland, and Louis promptly devoted himself to his\nown interests, conniving at many things which were inimical to\nFrance. He was planning high advancement for his brother Lucien,\nand Lucien suddenly married a disreputable actress and fled with\nher to England, where he was received with pleasure by the most\npersistent of all Napoleon’s enemies.",
        "So much for his brothers–incompetent, ungrateful, or openly his\nfoes. But his three sisters were no less remarkable in the\nrelations which they bore to him. They have been styled “the three\ncrowned courtesans,” and they have been condemned together as\nbeing utterly void of principle and monsters of ingratitude.",
        "Much of this censure was well deserved by all of them–by Caroline\nand Elise and Pauline. But when we look at the facts impartially\nwe shall find something which makes Pauline stand out alone as\ninfinitely superior to her sisters. Of all the Bonapartes she was\nthe only one who showed fidelity and gratitude to the great\nemperor, her brother. Even Mme. Mere, Napoleon’s mother, who\nbeyond all question transmitted to him his great mental and\nphysical power, did nothing for him. At the height of his splendor\nshe hoarded sous and francs and grumblingly remarked:",
        "“All this is for a time. It isn’t going to last!”",
        "Pauline, however, was in one respect different from all her\nkindred. Napoleon made Elise a princess in her own right and gave\nher the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He married Caroline to Marshal\nMurat, and they became respectively King and Queen of Naples. For\nPauline he did very little–less, in fact, than for any other\nmember of his family–and yet she alone stood by him to the end.",
        "This feather-headed, languishing, beautiful, distracting morsel of\nfrivolity, who had the manners of a kitten and the morals of a\ncat, nevertheless was not wholly unworthy to be Napoleon’s sister.\nOne has to tell many hard things of her; and yet one almost\npardons her because of her underlying devotion to the man who made\nthe name of Bonaparte illustrious for ever. Caroline, Queen of\nNaples, urged her husband to turn against his former chief. Elise,\nsour and greedy, threw in her fortunes with the Murats. Pauline,\nas we shall see, had the one redeeming trait of gratitude.",
        "To those who knew her she was from girlhood an incarnation of what\nused to be called “femininity.” We have to-day another and a\nhigher definition of womanhood, but to her contemporaries, and to\nmany modern writers, she has seemed to be first of all woman–\n\"woman to the tips of her rosy finger-nails,” says Levy. Those who\nsaw her were distracted by her loveliness. They say that no one\ncan form any idea of her beauty from her pictures. “A veritable\nmasterpiece of creation,” she had been called. Frederic Masson\ndeclares:",
        " She was so much more the typical woman that with her the defects\ncommon to women reached their highest development, while her\nbeauty attained a perfection which may justly be called unique.",
        " No one speaks of Pauline Bonaparte’s character or of her\nintellect, but wholly of her loveliness and charm, and, it must be\nadded, of her utter lack of anything like a moral sense.",
        "Even as a child of thirteen, when the Bonapartes left Corsica and\ntook up their abode in Marseilles, she attracted universal\nattention by her wonderful eyes, her grace, and also by the utter\nlack of decorum which she showed. The Bonaparte girls at this time\nlived almost on charity. The future emperor was then a captain of\nartillery and could give them but little out of his scanty pay.",
        "Pauline–or, as they called her in those days, Paulette–wore\nunbecoming hats and shabby gowns, and shoes that were full of\nholes. None the less, she was sought out by several men of note,\namong them Freron, a commissioner of the Convention. He visited\nPauline so often as to cause unfavorable comment; but he was in\nlove with her, and she fell in love with him to the extent of her\ncapacity. She used to write him love letters in Italian, which\nwere certainly not lacking in ardor. Here is the end of one of\nthem:",
        "I love you always and most passionately. I love you for ever, my\nbeautiful idol, my heart, my appealing lover. I love you, love\nyou, love you, the most loved of lovers, and I swear never to love\nany one else!",
        "This was interesting in view of the fact that soon afterward she\nfell in love with Junot, who became a famous marshal. But her love\naffairs never gave her any serious trouble; and the three sisters,\nwho now began to feel the influence of Napoleon’s rise to power,\nenjoyed themselves as they had never done before. At Antibes they\nhad a beautiful villa, and later a mansion at Milan.",
        "By this time Napoleon had routed the Austrians in Italy, and all\nFrance was ringing with his name. What was Pauline like in her\nmaidenhood? Arnault says:",
        "She was an extraordinary combination of perfect physical beauty\nand the strangest moral laxity. She was as pretty as you please,\nbut utterly unreasonable. She had no more manners than a school-\ngirl–talking incoherently, giggling at everything and nothing,\nand mimicking the most serious persons of rank.",
        "General de Ricard, who knew her then, tells in his monograph of\nthe private theatricals in which Pauline took part, and of the\nsport which they had behind the scenes. He says:",
        "The Bonaparte girls used literally to dress us. They pulled our\nears and slapped us, but they always kissed and made up later. We\nused to stay in the girls’ room all the time when they were\ndressing.",
        "Napoleon was anxious to see his sisters in some way settled. He\nproposed to General Marmont to marry Pauline. The girl was then\nonly seventeen, and one might have had some faith in her\ncharacter. But Marmont was shrewd and knew her far too well. The\nwords in which he declined the honor are interesting:",
        "“I know that she is charming and exquisitely beautiful; yet I have\ndreams of domestic happiness, of fidelity, and of virtue. Such\ndreams are seldom realized, I know. Still, in the hope of winning\nthem–”",
        "And then he paused, coughed, and completed what he had to say in a\nsort of mumble, but his meaning was wholly clear. He would not\naccept the offer of Pauline in marriage, even though she was the\nsister of his mighty chief.",
        "Then Napoleon turned to General Leclerc, with whom Pauline had for\nsome time flirted, as she had flirted with almost all the officers\nof Napoleon’s staff. Leclerc was only twenty-six. He was rich and\nof good manners, but rather serious and in poor health. This was\nnot precisely the sort of husband for Pauline, if we look at it in\nthe conventional way; but it served Napoleon’s purpose and did not\nin the least interfere with his sister’s intrigues.",
        "Poor Leclerc, who really loved Pauline, grew thin, and graver\nstill in manner. He was sent to Spain and Portugal, and finally\nwas made commander-in-chief of the French expedition to Haiti,\nwhere the famous black rebel, Toussaint l’Ouverture, was heading\nan uprising of the negroes.",
        "Napoleon ordered Pauline to accompany her husband. Pauline flatly\nrefused, although she made this an occasion for ordering\n\"mountains of pretty clothes and pyramids of hats.” But still she\nrefused to go on board the flag-ship. Leclerc expostulated and\npleaded, but the lovely witch laughed in his face and still\npersisted that she would never go.",
        "Word was brought to Napoleon. He made short work of her\nresistance.",
        "“Bring a litter,” he said, with one of his steely glances. “Order\nsix grenadiers to thrust her into it, and see that she goes on\nboard forthwith.”",
        "And so, screeching like an angry cat, she was carried on board,\nand set sail with her husband and one of her former lovers. She\nfound Haiti and Santo Domingo more agreeable than she had\nsupposed. She was there a sort of queen who could do as she\npleased and have her orders implicitly obeyed. Her dissipation was\nsomething frightful. Her folly and her vanity were beyond belief.",
        "But at the end of two years both she and her husband fell ill. He\nwas stricken down by the yellow fever, which was decimating the\nFrench army. Pauline was suffering from the results of her life in\na tropical climate. Leclerc died, the expedition was abandoned,\nand Pauline brought the general’s body back to France. When he was\nburied she, still recovering from her fever, had him interred in a\ncostly coffin and paid him the tribute of cutting off her\nbeautiful hair and burying it with him.",
        "“What a touching tribute to her dead husband!” said some one to\nNapoleon.",
        "The emperor smiled cynically as he remarked:",
        "“H’m! Of course she knows that her hair is bound to fall out after\nher fever, and that it will come in longer and thicker for being\ncropped.”",
        "Napoleon, in fact, though he loved Pauline better than his other\nsisters–or perhaps because he loved her better–was very strict\nwith her. He obliged her to wear mourning, and to observe some of\nthe proprieties; but it was hard to keep her within bounds.",
        "Presently it became noised about that Prince Camillo Borghese was\nexceedingly intimate with her. The prince was an excellent\nspecimen of the fashionable Italian. He was immensely rich. His\npalace at Rome was crammed with pictures, statues, and every sort\nof artistic treasure. He was the owner, moreover, of the famous\nBorghese jewels, the finest collection of diamonds in the world.",
        "Napoleon rather sternly insisted upon her marrying Borghese.\nFortunately, the prince was very willing to be connected with\nNapoleon; while Pauline was delighted at the idea of having\ndiamonds that would eclipse all the gems which Josephine\npossessed; for, like all of the Bonapartes, she detested her\nbrother’s wife. So she would be married and show her diamonds to\nJosephine. It was a bit of feminine malice which she could not\nresist.",
        "The marriage took place very quietly at Joseph Bonaparte’s house,\nbecause of the absence of Napoleon; but the newly made princess\nwas invited to visit Josephine at the palace of Saint-Cloud. Here\nwas to be the triumph of her life. She spent many days in planning\na toilet that should be absolutely crushing to Josephine. Whatever\nshe wore must be a background for the famous diamonds. Finally she\ndecided on green velvet.",
        "When the day came Pauline stood before a mirror and gazed at\nherself with diamonds glistening in her hair, shimmering around\nher neck, and fastened so thickly on her green velvet gown as to\nremind one of a moving jewel-casket. She actually shed tears for\njoy. Then she entered her carriage and drove out to Saint-Cloud.",
        "But the Creole Josephine, though no longer young, was a woman of\ngreat subtlety as well as charm. Stories had been told to her of\nthe green velvet, and therefore she had her drawing-room\nredecorated in the most uncompromising blue. It killed the green\nvelvet completely. As for the diamonds, she met that maneuver by\nwearing not a single gem of any kind. Her dress was an Indian\nmuslin with a broad hem of gold.",
        "Her exquisite simplicity, coupled with her dignity of bearing,\nmade the Princess Pauline, with her shower of diamonds, and her\ngreen velvet displayed against the blue, seem absolutely vulgar.\nJosephine was most generous in her admiration of the Borghese\ngems, and she kissed Pauline on parting. The victory was hers.",
        "There is another story of a defeat which Pauline met from another\nlady, one Mme. de Coutades. This was at a magnificent ball given\nto the most fashionable world of Paris. Pauline decided upon\ngoing, and intended, in her own phrase, to blot out every woman\nthere. She kept the secret of her toilet absolutely, and she\nentered the ballroom at the psychological moment, when all the\nguests had just assembled.",
        "She appeared; and at sight of her the music stopped, silence fell\nupon the assemblage, and a sort of quiver went through every one.\nHer costume was of the finest muslin bordered with golden palm-\nleaves. Four bands, spotted like a leopard’s skin, were wound\nabout her head, while these in turn were supported by little\nclusters of golden grapes. She had copied the head-dress of a\nBacchante in the Louvre. All over her person were cameos, and just\nbeneath her breasts she wore a golden band held in place by an\nengraved gem. Her beautiful wrists, arms, and hands were bare. She\nhad, in fact, blotted out her rivals.",
        "Nevertheless, Mme. de Coutades took her revenge. She went up to\nPauline, who was lying on a divan to set off her loveliness, and\nbegan gazing at the princess through a double eye-glass. Pauline\nfelt flattered for a moment, and then became uneasy. The lady who\nwas looking at her said to a companion, in a tone of compassion:",
        "“What a pity! She really would be lovely if it weren’t for THAT!”",
        "“For what?” returned her escort.",
        "“Why, are you blind? It’s so remarkable that you SURELY must see\nit.”",
        "Pauline was beginning to lose her self-composure. She flushed and\nlooked wildly about, wondering what was meant. Then she heard Mme.\nCoutades say:",
        "“Why, her ears. If I had such ears as those I would cut them off!”",
        "Pauline gave one great gasp and fainted dead away. As a matter of\nfact, her ears were not so bad. They were simply very flat and\ncolorless, forming a contrast with the rosy tints of her face. But\nfrom that moment no one could see anything but these ears; and\nthereafter the princess wore her hair low enough to cover them.",
        "This may be seen in the statue of her by Canova. It was considered\na very daring thing for her to pose for him in the nude, for only\na bit of drapery is thrown over her lower limbs. Yet it is true\nthat this statue is absolutely classical in its conception and\nexecution, and its interest is heightened by the fact that its\nmodel was what she afterward styled herself, with true Napoleonic\npride–\"a sister of Bonaparte.”",
        "Pauline detested Josephine and was pleased when Napoleon divorced\nher; but she also disliked the Austrian archduchess, Marie Louise,\nwho was Josephine’s successor. On one occasion, at a great court\nfunction, she got behind the empress and ran out her tongue at\nher, in full view of all the nobles and distinguished persons\npresent. Napoleon’s eagle eye flashed upon Pauline and blazed like\nfire upon ice. She actually took to her heels, rushed out of the\nball, and never visited the court again.",
        "It would require much time to tell of her other eccentricities, of\nher intrigues, which were innumerable, of her quarrel with her\nhusband, and of the minor breaches of decorum with which she\nstartled Paris. One of these was her choice of a huge negro to\nbathe her every morning. When some one ventured to protest, she\nanswered, naively:",
        "“What! Do you call that thing a MAN?”",
        "And she compromised by compelling her black servitor to go out and\nmarry some one at once, so that he might continue his\nministrations with propriety!",
        "To her Napoleon showed himself far more severe than with either\nCaroline or Elise. He gave her a marriage dowry of half a million\nfrancs when she became the Princess Borghese, but after that he\nwas continually checking her extravagances. Yet in 1814, when the\ndownfall came and Napoleon was sent into exile at Elba, Pauline\nwas the only one of all his relatives to visit him and spend her\ntime with him. His wife fell away and went back to her Austrian\nrelatives. Of all the Bonapartes only Pauline and Mme. Mere\nremained faithful to the emperor.",
        "Even then Napoleon refused to pay a bill of hers for sixty-two\nfrancs, while he allowed her only two hundred and forty francs for\nthe maintenance of her horses. But she, with a generosity of which\none would have thought her quite incapable, gave to her brother a\ngreat part of her fortune. When he escaped from Elba and began the\ncampaign of 1815 she presented him with all the Borghese diamonds.\nIn fact, he had them with him in his carriage at Waterloo, where\nthey were captured by the English. Contrast this with the meanness\nand ingratitude of her sisters and her brothers, and one may well\nbelieve that she was sincerely proud of what it meant to be la\nsoeur de Bonaparte.",
        "When he was sent to St. Helena she was ill in bed and could not\naccompany him. Nevertheless, she tried to sell all her trinkets,\nof which she was so proud, in order that she might give him help.\nWhen he died she received the news with bitter tears “on hearing\nall the particulars of that long agony.”",
        "As for herself, she did not long survive. At the age of forty-four\nher last moments came. Knowing that she was to die, she sent for\nPrince Borghese and sought a reconciliation. But, after all, she\ndied as she had lived–\"the queen of trinkets” (la reine des\ncolifichets). She asked the servant to bring a mirror. She gazed\ninto it with her dying eyes; and then, as she sank back, it was\nwith a smile of deep content.",
        "“I am not afraid to die,” she said. “I am still beautiful!”",
        "There is one famous woman whom history condems while at the same\ntime it partly hides the facts which might mitigate the harshness\nof the judgment that is passed upon her. This woman is Marie\nLouise, Empress of France, consort of the great Napoleon, and\narchduchess of imperial Austria. When the most brilliant figure in\nall history, after his overthrow in 1814, was in tawdry exile on\nthe petty island of Elba, the empress was already about to become\na mother; and the father of her unborn child was not Napoleon, but\nanother man. This is almost all that is usually remembered of her\n–that she was unfaithful to Napoleon, that she abandoned him in\nthe hour of his defeat, and that she gave herself with readiness\nto one inferior in rank, yet with whom she lived for years, and to\nwhom she bore what a French writer styled “a brood of bastards.”",
        "Naturally enough, the Austrian and German historians do not have\nmuch to say of Marie Louise, because in her own disgrace she also\nbrought disgrace upon the proudest reigning family in Europe.\nNaturally, also, French writers, even those who are hostile to\nNapoleon, do not care to dwell upon the story; since France itself\nwas humiliated when its greatest genius and most splendid soldier\nwas deceived by his Austrian wife. Therefore there are still many\nwho know little beyond the bare fact that the Empress Marie Louise\nthrew away her pride as a princess, her reputation as a wife, and\nher honor as a woman. Her figure seems to crouch in a sort of\nmurky byway, and those who pass over the highroad of history\nignore it with averted eyes.",
        "In reality the story of Napoleon and Marie Louise and of the Count\nvon Neipperg is one which, when you search it to the very core,\nleads you straight to a sex problem of a very curious nature.\nNowhere else does it occur in the relations of the great\npersonages of history; but in literature Balzac, that master of\npsychology, has touched upon the theme in the early chapters of\nhis famous novel called “A Woman of Thirty.”",
        "As to the Napoleonic story, let us first recall the facts of the\ncase, giving them in such order that their full significance may\nbe understood.",
        "In 1809 Napoleon, then at the plenitude of his power, shook\nhimself free from the clinging clasp of Josephine and procured the\nannulment of his marriage to her. He really owed her nothing.\nBefore he knew her she had been the mistress of another. In the\nfirst years of their life together she had been notoriously\nunfaithful to him. He had held to her from habit which was in part\na superstition; but the remembrance of the wrong which she had\ndone him made her faded charms at times almost repulsive. And then\nJosephine had never borne him any children; and without a son to\nperpetuate his dynasty, the gigantic achievements which he had\nwrought seemed futile in his eyes, and likely to crumble into\nnothingness when he should die.",
        "No sooner had the marriage been annulled than his titanic ambition\nleaped, as it always did, to a tremendous pinnacle. He would wed.\nHe would have children. But he would wed no petty princess. This\nman who in his early youth had felt honored by a marriage with the\nalmost declassee widow of a creole planter now stretched out his\nhand that he might take to himself a woman not merely royal but\nimperial.",
        "At first he sought the sister of the Czar of Russia; but Alexander\nentertained a profound distrust of the French emperor, and managed\nto evade the tentative demand. There was, however, a reigning\nfamily far more ancient than the Romanoffs–a family which had\nheld the imperial dignity for nearly six centuries–the oldest and\nthe noblest blood in Europe. This was the Austrian house of\nHapsburg. Its head, the Emperor Francis, had thirteen children, of\nwhom the eldest, the Archduchess Marie Louise, was then in her\nnineteenth year.",
        "Napoleon had resented the rebuff which the Czar had given him. He\nturned, therefore, the more eagerly to the other project. Yet\nthere were many reasons why an Austrian marriage might be\ndangerous, or, at any rate, ill-omened. Only sixteen years before,\nan Austrian arch-duchess, Marie Antionette, married to the ruler\nof France, had met her death upon the scaffold, hated and cursed\nby the French people, who had always blamed “the Austrian” for the\nevil days which had ended in the flames of revolution. Again, the\nfather of the girl to whom Napoleon’s fancy turned had been the\nbitter enemy of the new regime in France. His troops had been\nbeaten by the French in five wars and had been crushed at\nAusterlitz and at Wagram. Bonaparte had twice entered Vienna at\nthe head of a conquering army, and thrice he had slept in the\nimperial palace at Schonbrunn, while Francis was fleeing through\nthe dark, a beaten fugitive pursued by the swift squadrons of\nFrench cavalry.",
        "The feeling of Francis of Austria was not merely that of the\nvanquished toward the victor. It was a deep hatred almost\nreligious in its fervor. He was the head and front of the old-time\nfeudalism of birth and blood; Napoleon was the incarnation of the\nmodern spirit which demolished thrones and set an iron heel upon\ncrowned heads, giving the sacred titles of king and prince to\nsoldiers who, even in palaces, still showed the swaggering\nbrutality of the camp and the stable whence they sprang. Yet, just\nbecause an alliance with the Austrian house seemed in so many ways\nimpossible, the thought of it inflamed the ardor of Napoleon all\nthe more.",
        "“Impossible?” he had once said, contemptuously. “The word\n’impossible’ is not French.”",
        "The Austrian alliance, unnatural though it seemed, was certainly\nquite possible. In the year 1809 Napoleon had finished his fifth\nwar with Austria by the terrific battle of Wagram, which brought\nthe empire of the Hapsburgs to the very dust. The conqueror’s rude\nhand had stripped from Francis province after province. He had\neven let fall hints that the Hapsburgs might be dethroned and that\nAustria might disappear from the map of Europe, to be divided\nbetween himself and the Russian Czar, who was still his ally. It\nwas at this psychological moment that the Czar wounded Napoleon’s\npride by refusing to give the hand of his sister Anne.",
        "The subtle diplomats of Vienna immediately saw their chance.\nPrince Metternich, with the caution of one who enters the cage of\na man-eating-tiger, suggested that the Austrian archduchess would\nbe a fitting bride for the French conqueror. The notion soothed\nthe wounded vanity of Napoleon. From that moment events moved\nswiftly; and before long it was understood that there was to be a\nnew empress in France, and that she was to be none other than the\ndaughter of the man who had been Napoleon’s most persistent foe\nupon the Continent. The girl was to be given–sacrificed, if you\nlike–to appease an imperial adventurer. After such a marriage,\nAustria would be safe from spoliation. The reigning dynasty would\nremain firmly seated upon its historic throne.",
        "But how about the girl herself? She had always heard Napoleon\nspoken of as a sort of ogre–a man of low ancestry, a brutal and\nfaithless enemy of her people. She knew that this bold, rough-\nspoken soldier less than a year before had added insult to the\ninjury which he had inflicted on her father. In public\nproclamations he had called the Emperor Francis a coward and a\nliar. Up to the latter part of the year Napoleon was to her\nimagination a blood-stained, sordid, and yet all-powerful monster,\noutside the pale of human liking and respect. What must have been\nher thoughts when her father first told her with averted face that\nshe was to become the bride of such a being?",
        "Marie Louise had been brought up, as all German girls of rank were\nthen brought up, in quiet simplicity and utter innocence. In\nperson she was a tall blonde, with a wealth of light brown hair\ntumbling about a face which might be called attractive because it\nwas so youthful and so gentle, but in which only poets and\ncourtiers could see beauty. Her complexion was rosy, with that\npeculiar tinge which means that in the course of time it will\nbecome red and mottled. Her blue eyes were clear and childish. Her\nfigure was good, though already too full for a girl who was\nyounger than her years.",
        "She had a large and generous mouth with full lips, the lower one\nbeing the true “Hapsburg lip,” slightly pendulous–a feature which\nhas remained for generation after generation as a sure sign of\nHapsburg blood. One sees it in the present emperor of Austria, in\nthe late Queen Regent of Spain, and in the present King of Spain,\nAlfonso. All the artists who made miniatures or paintings of Marie\nLouise softened down this racial mark so that no likeness of her\nshows it as it really was. But take her all in all, she was a\nsimple, childlike, German madchen who knew nothing of the outside\nworld except what she had heard from her discreet and watchful\ngoverness, and what had been told her of Napoleon by her uncles,\nthe archdukes whom he had beaten down in battle.",
        "When she learned that she was to be given to the French emperor\nher girlish soul experienced a shudder; but her father told her\nhow vital was this union to her country and to him. With a sort of\npiteous dread she questioned the archdukes who had called Napoleon\nan ogre.",
        "“Oh, that was when Napoleon was an enemy,” they replied. “Now he\nis our friend.”",
        "Marie Louise listened to all this, and, like the obedient German\ngirl she was, yielded her own will.",
        "Events moved with a rush, for Napoleon was not the man to dally.\nJosephine had retired to her residence at Malmaison, and Paris was\nalready astir with preparations for the new empress who was to\nassure the continuation of the Napoleonic glory by giving children\nto her husband. Napoleon had said to his ambassador with his usual\nbluntness:",
        "“This is the first and most important thing–she must have\nchildren.”",
        "To the girl whom he was to marry he sent the following letter–an\nodd letter, combining the formality of a negotiator with the\nveiled ardor of a lover:",
        "MY COUSIN: The brilliant qualities which adorn your person have\ninspired in me a desire to serve you and to pay you homage. In\nmaking my request to the emperor, your father, and praying him to\nintrust to me the happiness of your imperial highness, may I hope\nthat you will understand the sentiments which lead me to this act?\nMay I flatter myself that it will not be decided solely by the\nduty of parental obedience? However slightly the feelings of your\nimperial highness may incline to me, I wish to cultivate them with\nso great care, and to endeavor so constantly to please you in\neverything, that I flatter myself that some day I shall prove\nattractive to you. This is the end at which I desire to arrive,\nand for which I pray your highness to be favorable to me.",
        "Immediately everything was done to dazzle the imagination of the\ngirl. She had dressed always in the simplicity of the school-room.\nHer only ornaments had been a few colored stones which she\nsometimes wore as a necklace or a bracelet. Now the resources of\nall France were drawn upon. Precious laces foamed about her.\nCascades of diamonds flashed before her eyes. The costliest and\nmost exquisite creations of the Parisian shops were spread around\nher to make up a trousseau fit for the princess who was soon to\nbecome the bride of the man who had mastered continental Europe.",
        "The archives of Vienna were ransacked for musty documents which\nwould show exactly what had been done for other Austrian\nprincesses who had married rulers of France. Everything was\nduplicated down to the last detail. Ladies-in-waiting thronged\nabout the young archduchess; and presently there came to her Queen\nCaroline of Naples, Napoleon’s sister, of whom Napoleon himself\nonce said: “She is the only man among my sisters, as Joseph is the\nonly woman among my brothers.” Caroline, by virtue of her rank as\nqueen, could have free access to her husband’s future bride. Also,\nthere came presently Napoleon’s famous marshal, Berthier, Prince\nof Neuchatel, the chief of the Old Guard, who had just been\ncreated Prince of Wagram–a title which, very naturally, he did\nnot use in Austria. He was to act as proxy for Napoleon in the\npreliminary marriage service at Vienna.",
        "All was excitement. Vienna had never been so gay. Money was\nlavished under the direction of Caroline and Berthier. There were\nilluminations and balls. The young girl found herself the center\nof the world’s interest; and the excitement made her dizzy. She\ncould not but be flattered, and yet there were many hours when her\nheart misgave her. More than once she was found in tears. Her\nfather, an affectionate though narrow soul, spent an entire day\nwith her consoling and reassuring her. One thought she always kept\nin mind–what she had said to Metternich at the very first: “I\nwant only what my duty bids me want.” At last came the official\nmarriage, by proxy, in the presence of a splendid gathering. The\nvarious documents were signed, the dowry was arranged for. Gifts\nwere scattered right and left. At the opera there were gala\nperformances. Then Marie Louise bade her father a sad farewell.\nAlmost suffocated by sobs and with her eyes streaming with tears,\nshe was led between two hedges of bayonets to her carriage, while\ncannon thundered and all the church-bells of Vienna rang a joyful\npeal.",
        "She set out for France accompanied by a long train of carriages\nfilled with noblemen and noblewomen, with ladies-in-waiting and\nscores of attendant menials. The young bride–the wife of a man\nwhom she had never seen–was almost dead with excitement and\nfatigue. At a station in the outskirts of Vienna she scribbled a\nfew lines to her father, which are a commentary upon her state of\nmind:",
        "I think of you always, and I always shall. God has given me power\nto endure this final shock, and in Him alone I have put all my\ntrust. He will help me and give me courage, and I shall find\nsupport in doing my duty toward you, since it is all for you that\nI have sacrificed myself.",
        "There is something piteous in this little note of a frightened\ngirl going to encounter she knew not what, and clinging almost\nfrantically to the one thought–that whatever might befall her,\nshe was doing as her father wished.",
        "One need not recount the long and tedious journey of many days\nover wretched roads, in carriages that jolted and lurched and\nswayed. She was surrounded by unfamiliar faces and was compelled\nto meet at every town the chief men of the place, all of whom paid\nher honor, but stared at her with irrepressible curiosity. Day\nafter day she went on and on. Each morning a courier on a foaming\nhorse presented her with a great cluster of fresh flowers and a\nfew lines scrawled by the unknown husband who was to meet her at\nher journey’s end.",
        "There lay the point upon which her wandering thoughts were\nfocused–the journey’s end! The man whose strange, mysterious\npower had forced her from her school-room, had driven her through\na nightmare of strange happenings, and who was waiting for her\nsomewhere to take her to himself, to master her as he had mastered\ngenerals and armies!",
        "What was marriage? What did it mean? What experience still lay\nbefore her! These were the questions which she must have asked\nherself throughout that long, exhausting journey. When she thought\nof the past she was homesick. When she thought of the immediate\nfuture she was fearful with a shuddering fear.",
        "At last she reached the frontier of France, and her carriage\npassed into a sort of triple structure, the first pavilion of\nwhich was Austrian, while the middle pavilion was neutral, and the\nfarther one was French. Here she was received by those who were\nafterward to surround her–the representatives of the Napoleonic\ncourt. They were not all plebeians and children of the Revolution,\nex-stable boys, ex-laundresses. By this time Napoleon had gathered\naround himself some of the noblest families of France, who had\nrallied to the empire. The assemblage was a brilliant one. There\nwere Montmorencys and Beaumonts and Audenardes in abundance. But\nto Marie Louise, as to her Austrian attendants, they were all\nalike. They were French, they were strangers, and she shrank from\nthem.",
        "Yet here her Austrians must leave her. All who had accompanied her\nthus far were now turned back. Napoleon had been insistent on this\npoint. Even her governess, who had been with her since her\nchildhood, was not allowed to cross the French frontier. So fixed\nwas Napoleon’s purpose to have nothing Austrian about her, that\neven her pet dog, to which she clung as a girl would cling, was\ntaken from her. Thereafter she was surrounded only by French\nfaces, by French guards, and was greeted only by salvos of French\nartillery.",
        "In the mean time what was Napoleon doing at Paris. Since the\nannulment of his marriage with Josephine he had gone into a sort\nof retirement. Matters of state, war, internal reforms, no longer\ninterested him; but that restless brain could not sink into\nrepose. Inflamed with the ardor of a new passion, that passion was\nall the greater because he had never yet set eyes upon its object.\nMarriage with an imperial princess flattered his ambition. The\nyouth and innocence of the bride stirred his whole being with a\nthrill of novelty. The painted charms of Josephine, the mercenary\nfavors of actresses, the calculated ecstasies of the women of the\ncourt who gave themselves to him from vanity, had long since\npalled upon him. Therefore the impatience with which he awaited\nthe coming of Marie Louise became every day more tense.",
        "For a time he amused himself with planning down to the very last\ndetails the demonstrations that were to be given in her honor. He\norganized them as minutely as he had ever organized a conquering\narmy. He showed himself as wonderful in these petty things as he\nhad in those great strategic combinations which had baffled the\nablest generals of Europe. But after all had been arranged–even\nto the illuminations, the cheering, the salutes, and the etiquette\nof the court–he fell into a fever of impatience which gave him\nsleepless nights and frantic days. He paced up and down the\nTuileries, almost beside himself. He hurried off courier after\ncourier with orders that the postilions should lash their horses\nto bring the hour of meeting nearer still. He scribbled love\nletters. He gazed continually on the diamond-studded portrait of\nthe woman who was hurrying toward him.",
        "At last as the time approached he entered a swift traveling-\ncarriage and hastened to Compiegne, about fifty miles from Paris,\nwhere it had been arranged that he should meet his consort and\nwhence he was to escort her to the capital, so that they might be\nmarried in the great gallery of the Louvre. At Compiegne the\nchancellerie had been set apart for Napoleon’s convenience, while\nthe chateau had been assigned to Marie Louise and her attendants.\nWhen Napoleon’s carriage dashed into the place, drawn by horses\nthat had traveled at a gallop, the emperor could not restrain\nhimself. It was raining torrents and night was coming on, yet,\nnone the less, he shouted for fresh horses and pushed on to\nSoissons, where the new empress was to stop and dine. When he\nreached there and she had not arrived, new relays of horses were\ndemanded, and he hurried off once more into the dark.",
        "At the little village of Courcelles he met the courier who was\nriding in advance of the empress’s cortege.",
        "“She will be here in a few moments!” cried Napoleon; and he leaped\nfrom his carriage into the highway.",
        "The rain descended harder than ever, and he took refuge in the\narched doorway of the village church, his boots already bemired,\nhis great coat reeking with the downpour. As he crouched before\nthe church he heard the sound of carriages; and before long there\ncame toiling through the mud the one in which was seated the girl\nfor whom he had so long been waiting. It was stopped at an order\ngiven by an officer. Within it, half-fainting with fatigue and\nfear, Marie Louise sat in the dark, alone.",
        "Here, if ever, was the chance for Napoleon to win his bride. Could\nhe have restrained himself, could he have shown the delicate\nconsideration which was demanded of him, could he have remembered\nat least that he was an emperor and that the girl–timid and\nshuddering–was a princess, her future story might have been far\ndifferent. But long ago he had ceased to think of anything except\nhis own desires.",
        "He approached the carriage. An obsequious chamberlain drew aside\nthe leathern covering and opened the door, exclaiming as he did\nso, “The emperor!” And then there leaped in the rain-soaked, mud-\nbespattered being whose excesses had always been as unbridled as\nhis genius. The door was closed, the leathern curtain again drawn,\nand the horses set out at a gallop for Soissons. Within, the\nshrinking bride was at the mercy of pure animal passion, feeling\nupon her hot face a torrent of rough kisses, and yielding herself\nin terror to the caresses of wanton hands.",
        "At Soissons Napoleon allowed no halt, but the carriage plunged on,\nstill in the rain, to Compiegne. There all the arrangements made\nwith so much care were thrust aside. Though the actual marriage\nhad not yet taken place, Napoleon claimed all the rights which\nafterward were given in the ceremonial at Paris. He took the girl\nto the chancellerie, and not to the chateau. In an anteroom dinner\nwas served with haste to the imperial pair and Queen Caroline.\nThen the latter was dismissed with little ceremony, the lights\nwere extinguished, and this daughter of a line of emperors was\nleft to the tender mercies of one who always had about him\nsomething of the common soldier–the man who lives for loot and\nlust. ... At eleven the next morning she was unable to rise and\nwas served in bed by the ladies of her household.",
        "These facts, repellent as they are, must be remembered when we\ncall to mind what happened in the next five years. The horror of\nthat night could not be obliterated by splendid ceremonies, by\nstudious attention, or by all the pomp and gaiety of the court.\nNapoleon was then forty-one–practically the same age as his new\nwife’s father, the Austrian emperor; Marie Louise was barely\nnineteen and younger than her years. Her master must have seemed\nto be the brutal ogre whom her uncles had described.",
        "Installed in the Tuileries, she taught herself compliance. On\ntheir marriage night Napoleon had asked her briefly: “What did\nyour parents tell you?” And she had answered, meekly: “To be yours\naltogether and to obey you in everything.” But, though she gave\ncompliance, and though her freshness seemed enchanting to\nNapoleon, there was something concealed within her thoughts to\nwhich he could not penetrate. He gaily said to a member of the\ncourt:",
        "“Marry a German, my dear fellow. They are the best women in the\nworld–gentle, good, artless, and as fresh as roses.”",
        "Yet, at the same time, Napoleon felt a deep anxiety lest in her\nvery heart of hearts this German girl might either fear or hate\nhim secretly. Somewhat later Prince Metternich came from the\nAustrian court to Paris.",
        "“I give you leave,” said Napoleon, “to have a private interview\nwith the empress. Let her tell you what she likes, and I shall ask\nno questions. Even should I do so, I now forbid your answering\nme.”",
        "Metternich was closeted with the empress for a long while. When he\nreturned to the ante-room he found Napoleon fidgeting about, his\neyes a pair of interrogation-points.",
        "“I am sure,” he said, “that the empress told you that I was kind\nto her?”",
        "Metternich bowed and made no answer.",
        "“Well,” said Napoleon, somewhat impatiently, “at least I am sure\nthat she is happy. Tell me, did she not say so?”",
        "The Austrian diplomat remained unsmiling.",
        "“Your majesty himself has forbidden me to answer,” he returned\nwith another bow.",
        "We may fairly draw the inference that Marie Louise, though she\nadapted herself to her surroundings, was never really happy.\nNapoleon became infatuated with her. He surrounded her with every\npossible mark of honor. He abandoned public business to walk or\ndrive with her. But the memory of his own brutality must have\nvaguely haunted him throughout it all. He was jealous of her as he\nhad never been jealous of the fickle Josephine. Constant has\nrecorded that the greatest precautions were taken to prevent any\nperson whatsoever, and especially any man, from approaching the\nempress save in the presence of witnesses.",
        "Napoleon himself underwent a complete change of habits and\ndemeanor. Where he had been rough and coarse he became attentive\nand refined. His shabby uniforms were all discarded, and he spent\nhours in trying on new costumes. He even attempted to learn to\nwaltz, but this he gave up in despair. Whereas before he ate\nhastily and at irregular intervals, he now sat at dinner with\nunusual patience, and the court took on a character which it had\nnever had. Never before had he sacrificed either his public duty\nor his private pleasure for any woman. Even in the first ardor of\nhis marriage with Josephine, when he used to pour out his heart to\nher in letters from Italian battle-fields, he did so only after he\nhad made the disposition of his troops and had planned his\nmovements for the following day. Now, however, he was not merely\ndevoted, but uxorious; and in 1811, after the birth of the little\nKing of Rome, he ceased to be the earlier Napoleon altogether. He\nhad founded a dynasty. He was the head of a reigning house. He\nforgot the principles of the Revolution, and he ruled, as he\nthought, like other monarchs, by the grace of God.",
        "As for Marie Louise, she played her part extremely well. Somewhat\nhaughty and unapproachable to others, she nevertheless studied\nNapoleon’s every wish. She seemed even to be loving; but one can\nscarcely doubt that her obedience sprang ultimately from fear and\nthat her devotion was the devotion of a dog which has been beaten\ninto subjection.",
        "Her vanity was flattered in many ways, and most of all by her\nappointment as regent of the empire during Napoleon’s absence in\nthe disastrous Russian campaign which began in 1812. It was in\nJune of that year that the French emperor held court at Dresden,\nwhere he played, as was said, to “a parterre of kings.” This was\nthe climax of his magnificence, for there were gathered all the\nsovereigns and princes who were his allies and who furnished the\nlevies that swelled his Grand Army to six hundred thousand men.\nHere Marie Louise, like her husband, felt to the full the\nintoxication of supreme power. By a sinister coincidence it was\nhere that she first met the other man, then unnoticed and little\nheeded, who was to cast upon her a fascination which in the end\nproved irresistible.",
        "This man was Adam Albrecht, Count von Neipperg. There is something\nmysterious about his early years, and something baleful about his\nsilent warfare with Napoleon. As a very young soldier he had been\nan Austrian officer in 1793. His command served in Belgium; and\nthere, in a skirmish, he was overpowered by the French in superior\nnumbers, but resisted desperately. In the melee a saber slashed\nhim across the right side of his face, and he was made prisoner.\nThe wound deprived him of his right eye, so that for the rest of\nhis life he was compelled to wear a black bandage to conceal the\nmutilation.",
        "From that moment he conceived an undying hatred of the French,\nserving against them in the Tyrol and in Italy. He always claimed\nthat had the Archduke Charles followed his advice, the Austrians\nwould have forced Napoleon’s army to capitulate at Marengo, thus\nbringing early eclipse to the rising star of Bonaparte. However\nthis may be, Napoleon’s success enraged Neipperg and made his\nhatred almost the hatred of a fiend.",
        "Hitherto he had detested the French as a nation. Afterward he\nconcentrated his malignity upon the person of Napoleon. In every\nway he tried to cross the path of that great soldier, and, though\nNeipperg was comparatively an unknown man, his indomitable purpose\nand his continued intrigues at last attracted the notice of the\nemperor; for in 1808 Napoleon wrote this significant sentence:",
        "The Count von Neipperg is openly known to have been the enemy of\nthe French.",
        "Little did the great conqueror dream how deadly was the blow which\nthis Austrian count was destined finally to deal him!",
        "Neipperg, though his title was not a high one, belonged to the old\nnobility of Austria. He had proved his bravery in war and as a\nduelist, and he was a diplomat as well as a soldier. Despite his\nmutilation, he was a handsome and accomplished courtier, a man of\nwide experience, and one who bore himself in a manner which\nsuggested the spirit of romance. According to Masson, he was an\nAustrian Don Juan, and had won the hearts of many women. At thirty\nhe had formed a connection with an Italian woman named Teresa\nPola, whom he had carried away from her husband. She had borne him\nfive children; and in 1813 he had married her in order that these\nchildren might be made legitimate.",
        "In his own sphere the activity of Neipperg was almost as\nremarkable as Napoleon’s in a greater one. Apart from his exploits\non the field of battle he had been attached to the Austrian\nembassy in Paris, and, strangely enough, had been decorated by\nNapoleon himself with, the golden eagle of the Legion of Honor.\nFour months later we find him minister of Austria at the court of\nSweden, where he helped to lay the train of intrigue which was to\ndetach Bernadotte from Napoleon’s cause. In 1812, as has just been\nsaid, he was with Marie Louise for a short time at Dresden,\nhovering about her, already forming schemes. Two years after this\nhe overthrew Murat at Naples; and then hurried on post-haste to\nurge Prince Eugene to abandon Bonaparte.",
        "When the great struggle of 1814 neared its close, and Napoleon,\nfighting with his back to the wall, was about to succumb to the\nunited armies of Europe, it was evident that the Austrian emperor\nwould soon be able to separate his daughter from her husband. In\nfact, when Napoleon was sent to Elba, Marie Louise returned to\nVienna. The cynical Austrian diplomats resolved that she should\nnever again meet her imperial husband. She was made Duchess of\nParma in Italy, and set out for her new possessions; and the man\nwith the black band across his sightless eye was chosen to be her\nescort and companion.",
        "When Neipperg received this commission he was with Teresa Pola at\nMilan. A strange smile flitted across his face; and presently he\nremarked, with cynical frankness:",
        "“Before six months I shall be her lover, and, later on, her\nhusband.”",
        "He took up his post as chief escort of Marie Louise, and they\njourneyed slowly to Munich and Baden and Geneva, loitering on the\nway. Amid the great events which were shaking Europe this couple\nattracted slight attention. Napoleon, in Elba, longed for his wife\nand for his little son, the King of Rome. He sent countless\nmessages and many couriers; but every message was intercepted, and\nno courier reached his destination. Meanwhile Marie Louise was\nlingering agreeably in Switzerland. She was happy to have escaped\nfrom the whirlpool of politics and war. Amid the romantic scenery\nthrough which she passed Neipperg was always by her side,\nattentive, devoted, trying in everything to please her. With him\nshe passed delightful evenings. He sang to her in his rich\nbarytone songs of love. He seemed romantic with a touch of\nmystery, a gallant soldier whose soul was also touched by\nsentiment.",
        "One would have said that Marie Louise, the daughter of an imperial\nline, would have been proof against the fascinations of a person\nso far inferior to herself in rank, and who, beside the great\nemperor, was less than nothing. Even granting that she had never\nreally loved Napoleon, she might still have preferred to maintain\nher dignity, to share his fate, and to go down in history as the\nempress of the greatest man whom modern times have known.",
        "But Marie Louise was, after all, a woman, and she followed the\nguidance of her heart. To her Napoleon was still the man who had\nmet her amid the rain-storm at Courcelles, and had from the first\nmoment when he touched her violated all the instincts of a virgin.\nLater he had in his way tried to make amends; but the horror of\nthat first night had never wholly left her memory. Napoleon had\nunrolled before her the drama of sensuality, but her heart had not\nbeen given to him. She had been his empress. In a sense it might\nbe more true to say that she had been his mistress. But she had\nnever been duly wooed and won and made his wife–an experience\nwhich is the right of every woman. And so this Neipperg, with his\ndeferential manners, his soothing voice, his magnetic touch, his\nardor, and his devotion, appeased that craving which the master of\na hundred legions could not satisfy.",
        "In less than the six months of which Neipperg had spoken the\npsychological moment had arrived. In the dim twilight she listened\nto his words of love; and then, drawn by that irresistible power\nwhich masters pride and woman’s will, she sank into her lover’s\narms, yielding to his caresses, and knowing that she would be\nparted from him no more except by death.",
        "From that moment he was bound to her by the closest ties and lived\nwith her at the petty court of Parma. His prediction came true to\nthe very letter. Teresa Pola died, and then Napoleon died, and\nafter this Marie Louise and Neipperg were united in a morganatic\nmarriage. Three children were born to them before his death in\n1829.",
        "It is interesting to note how much of an impression was made upon\nher by the final exile of her imperial husband to St. Helena. When\nthe news was brought her she observed, casually:",
        "“Thanks. By the way, I should like to ride this morning to\nMarkenstein. Do you think the weather is good enough to risk it?”",
        "Napoleon, on his side, passed through agonies of doubt and longing\nwhen no letters came to him from Marie Louise. She was constantly\nin his thoughts during his exile at St. Helena. “When his faithful\nfriend and constant companion at St. Helena, the Count Las Casas,\nwas ordered by Sir Hudson Lowe to depart from St. Helena, Napoleon\nwrote to him:",
        "“Should you see, some day, my wife and son, embrace them. For two\nyears I have, neither directly nor indirectly, heard from them.\nThere has been on this island for six months a German botanist,\nwho has seen them in the garden of Schoenbrunn a few months before\nhis departure. The barbarians (meaning the English authorities at\nSt. Helena) have carefully prevented him from coming to give me\nany news respecting them.”",
        "At last the truth was told him, and he received it with that high\nmagnanimity, or it may be fatalism, which at times he was capable\nof showing. Never in all his days of exile did he say one word\nagainst her. Possibly in searching his own soul he found excuses\nsuch as we may find. In his will he spoke of her with great\naffection, and shortly before his death he said to his physician,\nAntommarchi:",
        "“After my death, I desire that you will take my heart, put it in\nthe spirits of wine, and that you carry it to Parma to my dear\nMarie Louise. You will please tell her that I tenderly loved her–\nthat I never ceased to love her. You will relate to her all that\nyou have seen, and every particular respecting my situation and\ndeath.”",
        "The story of Marie Louise is pathetic, almost tragic. There is the\ntaint of grossness about it; and yet, after all, there is a lesson\nin it–the lesson that true love cannot be forced or summoned at\ncommand, that it is destroyed before its birth by outrage, and\nthat it goes out only when evoked by sympathy, by tenderness, and\nby devotion.",
