        "In company avoid frequent and undue talk about your own\nactions and dangers. However pleasant it may be to you to enlarge\nupon the risks you have run, others may not find such pleasure in\nlistening to your adventures. Avoid provoking laughter also: it\nis a habit from which one easily slides into the ways of the\nfoolish, and apt to diminish the respect which your neighbours\nfeel for you. To border on coarse talk is also dangerous. On such\noccasions, if a convenient opportunity offer, rebuke the speaker.\nIf not, at least by relapsing into silence, colouring, and\nlooking annoyed, show that you are displeased with the subject.",
