        "The tall youth, turning to the right, went down a gentle slope until\nhe came to a little stream, where he knelt and drank. Despite his\nweariness, his thirst and his danger he noticed the silvery color of\nthe water, and its soft sighing sound, as it flowed over its pebbly\nbed, made a pleasant murmur in his ear. Robert Lennox always had an\neye for the beautiful, and the flashing brook, in its setting of deep,\nintense forest green, soothed his senses, speaking to him of comfort\nand hope.",
        "He drank again and then sat back among the bushes, still breathing\nheavily, but with much more freedom. The sharp pain left his chest,\nnew strength began to flow into his muscles, and, as the body was\nrenewed, so the spirit soared up and became sanguine once more. He put\nhis ear to the earth and listened long, but heard nothing, save sounds\nnatural to the wilderness, the rustling of leaves before the light\nwind, the whisper of the tiny current, and the occasional sweet note\nof a bird in brilliant dress, pluming itself on a bough in its pride.\nHe drew fresh courage from the peace of the woods, and resolved to\nremain longer there by the stream. Settling himself into the bushes\nand tall grass, until he was hidden from all but a trained gaze, he\nwaited, body and soul alike growing steadily in vigor.",
        "The forest was in its finest colors. Spring had never brought to it a\nmore splendid robe, gorgeous and glowing, its green adorned with wild\nflowers, and the bloom of bush and tree like a gigantic stretch of\ntapestry. The great trunks of oak and elm and maple grew in endless\nrows and overhead the foliage gleamed, a veil of emerald lace before\nthe sun.",
        "Robert drank in the glory, eye and ear, but he never failed to watch\nthe thickets, and to listen for hostile sounds. He knew full well that\nhis life rested upon his vigilance and, often as he had been in danger\nin the great northern woods, he valued too much these precious days of\nhis youth to risk their sudden end through any neglect of his own.",
        "He looked now and then at the bird which still preened itself on a\nlittle bough. When the shadows from the waving foliage fell upon\nits feathers it showed a bright purple, but when the sunlight poured\nthrough, it glowed a glossy blue. He did not know its name, but it was\na brave bird, a gay bird. Now and then it ceased its hopping back and\nforth, raised its head and sent forth a deep, sweet, thrilling note,\namazing in volume to come from so small a body. Had he dared to make a\nsound Robert would have whistled a bar or two in reply. The bird was a\nfriend to one alone and in need, and its dauntless melody made his\nown heart beat higher. If a creature so tiny was not afraid in the\nwilderness why should he be!",
        "He had learned to take sharp notice of everything. On the border and\nin such times, man was compelled to observe with eye and ear, with all\nthe five senses; and often too with a sixth sense, an intuition, an\noutgrowth of the other five, developed by long habit and training,\nwhich the best of the rangers possessed to a high degree, and in which\nthe lad was not lacking. He knew that the minutest trifle must not\nescape his attention, or the forfeit might be his life.",
        "While he relaxed his own care not at all, he felt that the bird was a\nwary sentinel for him. He knew that if an enemy came in haste through\nthe undergrowth it would fly away before him. He had been warned in\nthat manner in another crisis and he had full faith now in the caution\nof the valiant little singer. His trust, in truth, was so great that\nhe rose from his covert and bent down for a third drink of the clear\ncool water. Then he stood up, his figure defiant, and took long, deep\nbreaths, his heart now beating smoothly and easily, as if it had been\nput to no painful test. Still no sound of a foe, and he thought that\nperhaps the pursuit had died down, but he knew enough of the warriors\nof the woods to make sure, before he resumed a flight that would\nexpose him in the open.",
        "He crept back into the thicket, burying himself deep, and was careful\nnot to break a twig or brush a leaf which to the unerring eyes of\nthose who followed could mark where he was. Hidden well, but yet lying\nwhere he could see, he turned his gaze back to the bird. It was now\npouring out an unbroken volume of song as it swayed on a twig, like\na leaf shaken in the wind. Its voice was thrillingly sweet, and it\nseemed mad with joy, as its tiny throat swelled with the burden of its\nmelody. Robert, in the thicket, smiled, because he too shared in so\nmuch gladness.",
        "A faint sound out of the far west came to him. It was so slight\nthat it was hard to tell it from the whisper of the wind. It barely\nregistered on the drum of the ear, but when he listened again and with\nall his powers he was sure that it was a new and foreign note. Then he\nseparated it from the breeze among the leaves, and it seemed to him\nto contain a quality like that of the human voice. If so, it might\nbe hostile, because his friends, Willet, the hunter, and Tayoga, the\nOnondaga, were many miles away. He had left them on the shore of the\nlake, called by the whites, George, but more musically by the Indians,\nAndiatarocte, and there was nothing in their plans that would now\nbring them his way. However welcome they might be he could not hope\nfor them; foes only were to be expected.",
        "The faint cry, scarcely more than a variation of the wind, registered\nagain though lightly on the drum of his ear, and now he knew that it\ncame from the lungs of man, man the pursuer, man the slayer, and so,\nin this case, the red man, perhaps Tandakora, the fierce Ojibway chief\nhimself. Doubtless it was a signal, one band calling to another, and\nhe listened anxiously for the reply, but he did not hear it, the point\nfrom which it was sent being too remote, and he settled back into his\nbed of bushes and grass, resolved to keep quite still until he\ncould make up his mind about the next step. On the border as well as\nelsewhere it was always wise, when one did not know what to do, to do\nnothing.",
        "But the tall youth was keenly apprehensive. The signals indicated that\nthe pursuing force had spread out, and it might enclose him in a fatal\ncircle. His eager temperament, always sensitive to impressions, was\nkindled into fire, and his imagination painted the whole forest\nscene in the most vivid colors. A thought at first, it now became a\nconviction with him that Tandakora led the pursuit. The red leader had\ncome upon his trail in some way, and, venomous from so many failures,\nwould follow now for days in an effort to take him. He saw the huge\nOjibway again with all the intensity of reality, his malignant face,\nhis mighty body, naked to the waist and painted in hideous designs.\nHe saw too the warriors who were with him, many of them, and they were\nfully as eager and fierce as their chief.",
        "But his imagination which was so vital a part of him did not paint\nevil and danger alone; it drew the good in colors no less deep and\nglowing. It saw himself refreshed, stronger of body and keener of mind\nthan ever, escaping every wile and snare laid for his ruin. It saw\nhim making a victorious flight through the forest, his arrival at the\nshining lake, and his reunion with Willet and Tayoga, those faithful\nfriends of many a peril.",
        "He knew that if he waited long enough he would hear the Indian call\nonce more, as the bands must talk to one another if they carried out\na concerted pursuit, and he decided that when it came he would go. It\nwould be his signal too. The only trouble lay in the fact that they\nmight be too near when the cry was sent. Yet he must take the risk,\nand there was his sentinel bird still pluming itself in brilliant\ncolors on its waving bough.",
        "The bird sang anew, pouring forth a brilliant tune, and Robert from\nhis covert smiled up at it again. It had a fine spirit, a gay spirit\nlike his own and now it would surely warn him if danger crept too\nclose. While the thought was fresh in his mind the third signal\ncame, and now it was so clear and distinct that it indicated a rapid\napproach. But he was still unable to choose a way for his flight and\nhe lingered for a sign from the bird. If the warriors were stealing\nthrough the bushes it would fly directly from them. At least he\nbelieved so, and fancy had so much power over him, especially in such\na situation that belief became conviction.",
        "The bird stopped singing suddenly, but kept his perch on the waving\nbough. Robert always insisted that it looked straight at him before it\nuttered two or three sharp notes, and then, rising in the air, hovered\nfor a few minutes above the bough. It was obvious to him that his\ncall had come. Steeped in Indian lore he had seen earth and air work\nmiracles, and it was not less wonderful that a living creature should\nperform one now, and in his behalf.",
        "For a breathless instant or two he forgot the warriors and watched the\nbird, a flash of blue flame against the green veil of the forest. It\nwas perched there in order to be sure that he saw, and then it would\nshow the way! With every pulse beating hard he stood up silently,\nhis eyes still on the blue flash, confident that a new miracle was at\nhand.",
        "The bird uttered three or four notes, not short or sharp now, but\nsoft, long and beckoning, dying away in the gentlest of echoes. His\nimagination, as vivid as ever, translated it into a call to him to\ncome, and he was not in the least surprised, when the blue flame like\nthe pillow of cloud by day moved slowly to the northeast, and toward\nthe lake. Stepping cautiously he followed his sign, thrilled at the\ndoing of the miracle, his eyes on his flying guide, his ears attuned\nto warn him if any danger threatened from the forest so near.",
        "It never occurred to Robert that he might not be led aright. His faith\nand confidence were supreme. He had lived too much with Tayoga not to\nshare his belief that the hand of Manitou was stretched forth now to\nlead those who put their trust in him.",
        "The blue flame that was a living bird flew slowly on, pausing an\ninstant or two on a bough, turning for a short curve to right or\nleft, but always coming back to the main course that pointed toward\nAndiatarocte.",
        "He walked beside the little brook from which he had drunk, then across\nit and over a low hill, into a shallow valley, the forest everywhere,\nbut the undergrowth not too dense for easy passage. His attentive ear\nbrought no sound from either flank save those natural to the woods,\nthough he was sure that a hostile call would come soon. It would be\ntime for the bands to talk to one another. But he had no fear. The\nsupreme intervention had been made in his favor, and he kept his eyes\non his flying guide.",
        "They crossed the valley and began the ascent of another and high hill,\nrough with rocky outcrops and a heavy growth of briars and vines. His\npace became slower of necessity and once or twice he thought he had\nlost the blue flame, but it always reappeared, and, for the first\ntime since its flight from the bough, it sang a few notes, a clear\nmelodious treble, carrying far through the windy forest.",
        "The lad believed that the song was meant for him. Clearly it said to\nhim to follow, and, with equal clearness, it told him that safety lay\nonly in the path he now traveled. He believed, with all the ardor of\nhis soul, and there was no weariness in his body as he climbed the\nhigh hill. Near the summit, he heard on his right the long dying\nIndian cry so full of menace, its answer to the left, and then a third\nshout directly behind him. He understood. He was between the horns of\na crescent, and they were not far away. He left faint traces only as\nhe fled, but they had so much skill they could follow with speed, and\nhe was quite sure they expected to take him. This belief did not keep\nhis heart from beating high. They did not know how he was protected\nand led, and there was the blue flame before him always showing him\nthe way. He reached the crest of the hill, and saw other hills, fold\non fold, lying before him. He had hoped to catch a glimpse of the lake\nfrom the summit, but no glint of its waters came, and then he knew it\nmust yet be miles away. His heart sank for a moment. Andiatarocte had\nappealed to him as a refuge. Just why he did not know, but he vaguely\nexpected to find safety there. Perhaps he would meet Willet and Tayoga\nby its shore, and to him the three united always seemed invincible.",
        "His courage was gone only an instant or two. Then it came back\nstronger than ever. The note of his guide, clear and uplifting, rose\nagain, and he increased his speed, lest he be enclosed within those\nhorns. The far slope was rocky and he leaped from one stony outcrop to\nanother. Even if he could hide his trail only a few yards it would\nbe so much time gained while they were compelled to seek it. He was\nforced to watch his steps here, but, when he was at the bottom and\nlooked up, the blue flame was still before him. On it went over the\nnext slope and he followed at speed, noticing with joy that the rocky\nnature of the ground continued, and the most skillful warrior who ever\nlived must spend many minutes hunting his traces. He had no doubt that\nhe was gaining and he had proof of it in the fact that the pursuers\nnow uttered no cry. Had they been closing in on him they would have\ncalled to one another in triumph.",
        "Well for him that he was so strong and sound of heart and lung! Well\nfor him too that he was borne up by a great spirit and by his belief\nthat a supreme power was working in his behalf. He felt little\nweariness as he climbed a ridge. His breath was easy and regular and\nhis steps were long and swift. His guide was before him. Whatever his\npace, whether fast or slow, the distance between them never seemed to\nchange. The bird would dart aside, perhaps to catch an insect, but it\nalways returned promptly to its course.",
        "His eyes caught a gleam of silver from the crest of the fourth ridge\nthat he crossed, and he knew it was a ray of sunlight striking upon\nthe waters of the lake. Now his coveted haven was not so far away, and\nthe great pulses in his temples throbbed. He would reach the lake, and\nhe would find refuge. Tandakora, in all his malice, would fail once\nmore. The thought was so pleasant to him that he laughed aloud, and\nnow feeling the need to use the strength he had saved with such care\nhe began to run as fast as he could. It was his object to open up\na wide gap between himself and the warriors, one so great that, if\noccasion came, he might double or turn without being seen.",
        "The forest remained dense, a sea of trees with many bushes and\nclinging vines in which an ignorant or incautious runner would have\ntripped and fallen, but Robert was neither, and he did not forget, as\nhe fled, to notice where his feet fell. His skill and presence of mind\nkept him from stumbling or from making any noise that would draw the\nattention of possible pursuers who might have crept up on his flank.\nWhile they had only his faint trail to guide them the pursuit was\nimpeded, and, as long as they did not see him, his chance to hide was\nfar greater.",
        "He lost sight of his feathered guide two or three times, but the bird\nnever failed to reappear, a brilliant blue flame against the green\nwall of the wilderness, his emblem of hope, leading him over the hills\nand valleys toward Andiatarocte. Now he saw the lake from a crest, not\na mere band of silver showing through the trees, but a broad surface\nreflecting the sunlight in varied colors. It was a beacon to him, and,\nsummoning the last ounce of his strength and will, he ran at amazing\nspeed. Once more he heard the warriors behind him calling to one\nanother, and they were much farther away. His mighty effort had not\nbeen in vain. His pulses beat hard with the throb of victory not yet\nwon, but of which he felt sure, and he rejoiced too, because he had\ncome again upon rocky ground, where his flight left so little trace\nthat Tandakora himself would be baffled for a while.",
        "He knew that the shores of the lake at the point he was nearing were\ncomparatively low, and a vague plan to hide in the dense foliage at\nthe water’s edge came into his mind. He did not know just how he would\ndo it, but he would be guided by events as they developed. The bird\nsurely would not lead him on unless less to safety, and no doubt\nentered his mind. But it was highly important to widen yet more the\ndistance between him and the warriors, and he still ran with all the\nspeed at his command.",
        "The last crest was reached and before him spread the splendid lake in\nits deep green setting, a glittering spectacle that he never failed to\nadmire, and that he admired even now, when his life was in peril, and\ninstants were precious. The bird perched suddenly on a bough, uttered\na few thrilling notes, and was then gone, a last blue flash into the\ndense foliage. He did not see it again, and he did not expect to\ndo so. Its work was done. Strong in the faith of the wilderness, he\nbelieved and always believed.",
        "He crouched a few moments on a ledge and looked back. Tandakora and\nhis men had not yet come in sight, nor could he hear them. Doubtless\nthey had lost his trail, when he leaped from one stone to another, and\nwere now looking for it. His time to hide, if he were to have one, was\nat hand, and he meant to make the most of the chance. He bent lower\nand remained there until his breathing became regular and easy after\nhis mighty effort, all his five senses and the sixth that was instinct\nor divination, alert to every sound.",
        "Two or three birds began to sing, but they were not his bird and he\ngave them no attention. A rabbit leaped from its nest under the bushes\nand ran. It went back on his trail and he considered it a sure sign\nthat his pursuers were yet distant. He might steal another precious\nminute or two for his overworked lungs and heart. He knew the need of\ndoing everything to gain a little more strength. It was his experience\nin border war and the stern training of Willet and Tayoga that made\nhim able to do so, and he was ruler enough of himself to wait yet a\nlittle longer than he had planned. Then when he felt that Tandakora\nmust be near, he straightened up, though not to his full height, and\nran swiftly down the long slope to the lake.",
        "He found at the bottom a narrow place between cliff and water, grown\nthickly with bushes, and he followed it at least half a mile, until\nthe shores towered above him dark and steep, and the lake came up\nagainst them like a wall. He could go no farther and he waded into a\ndense growth of bushes and weeds, where he stood up to his waist in\nwater and waited, hidden well.",
        "He knew that if the warriors followed and saw him he would have little\nopportunity to escape, but the chances were a hundred to one against\ntheir finding him in such a covert. Rock and water had blotted out his\ntrail and he felt safe. He secured his belt, containing his smaller\nweapons and ammunition, about his shoulders beyond touch of water, and\nput his rifle in the forks of two bushes, convenient to his hands.",
        "It was a luxury to rest, even if one did stand half-sunken in a lake.\nThe water was cold, but he did not yet feel the chill, and he listened\nfor possible sounds of pursuit. He heard, after a while, the calls of\nwarriors to one another and he laughed softly to himself. The shouts\nwere faint and moreover they came from the crest of the cliff. They\nhad not found his trail down the slope and they were hunting for him\non the heights. He laughed again with sheer satisfaction. He had been\nright. Rock and water had come to his aid, and he was too well hidden\neven for the eager eyes of Tandakora and his warriors to follow him.",
        "He waited a long time. He heard the cries nearer him, then farther\naway, and, at last, at such a great distance that they could barely\nbe separated from the lap of the waters. He was growing cold now; the\nchill from the lake was rising in his body, but with infinite patience\nbred by long practice of the wilderness he did not stir. He knew that\nsilence could be deceptive. Some of the warriors might come back,\nand might wait in a thicket, hoping that he would rise and disclose\nhimself, thinking the danger past. More than one careless wanderer\nin the past had been caught in such a manner, and he was resolved to\nguard against the trick. Making the last call upon his patience, he\nstood motionless, while the chill crept steadily upward through his\nveins and muscles.",
        "He could see the surface of the open lake through the veil of bushes\nand tall grass. The water broke in gentle waves under a light wind,\nand kept up a soft sighing that was musical and soothing. Had he been\nupon dry land he could have closed his eyes and gone to sleep, but,\nas it was, he did not complain, since he had found safety, if not\ncomfort. He even found strength in himself, despite his situation, to\nadmire the gleaming expanse of Andiatarocte with its shifting colors,\nand the far cliffs lofty and dim.",
        "Much of Robert’s life, much of its most eventful portion, was passing\naround this lake, and he had a peculiar affection for it. It always\naroused in him a sense of beauty, of charm and of majesty, and he had\ngrown too to look upon it as a friend and protector. He believed that\nit had brought him good luck, and he did not doubt that it would do so\nagain.",
        "He looked for a canoe, one perhaps that might contain Willet and\nTayoga, seeking him and keeping well beyond the aim of a lurking\nmarksman on the shore, but he saw no shadow on the water, nothing\nthat could be persuaded into the likeness of a boat, only wild fowl\ncircling and dipping, and, now and then, a gleam where a fish leaped\nup to fall swiftly back again. He was alone, and he must depend upon\nhimself only.",
        "He began to move a little, to lift one foot and then the other,\ncareful to make no splash in the water, and the slight exercise\nchecked the creeping chill. Encouraged, he increased it, stopping at\nintervals to listen for the approach of a foe. There was no sound\nand he walked back and forth a little. Presently his eyes, trained to\nobserve all things, noticed a change in the air. A gray tint, so far a\nmatter of quality rather than color, was coming into it, and his\nheart leaped with joy. Absorbed in his vital struggle he had failed to\nreckon the passage of time. The day was closing and blessed, covering\nnight was at hand. Robert loved the day and the sun, but darkness was\nalways a friend of those who fled, and now he prayed that it would\ncome thick and dark.",
        "The sun still hung over the eastern shores, red and blazing, but\nbefore long it went down, seeming to sink into the lake, and the night\nthat Robert had wished, heavy and black, swept over the earth. Then he\nleft the water, and stood upon dry land, the narrow ledge between the\ncliff and the waves, where he took off his lower garments, wrung them\nas nearly dry as he could, and, hanging them on the bushes, waited\nfor the wind to do the rest. His sense of triumph had never been so\nstrong. Alone and relying only upon his own courage and skill, he had\nescaped the fierce Tandakora and his persistent warriors. He could\neven boast of it to Willet and Tayoga, when he found them again.",
        "It was wonderful to feel safe, after great peril, and his bright\nimagination climbed the heights. As he had escaped them then, so he\nwould slip always from the snares of his foes. It was this quality in\nhim, the spirit of eternal hope, that appealed so strongly to all who\nknew him, and that made him so attractive.",
        "After a while, he took venison and hominy from his knapsack and ate\nwith content. Then he resumed his clothing, now dried completely by\nthe wind, and felt that he had never been stronger or more fitted to\ncope with attack.",
        "The darkness was intense and the surface of the lake showed through\nit, only a fitful gray. The cliff behind him was now a black bank, and\nits crest could not be seen at all. He was eager to go, but he still\nused the patience so necessary in the wilderness, knowing that the\nlonger he waited the less likely he was to meet the band of Tandakora.",
        "He lay down in a thicket of tall grass and bushes, resolved not to\nstart before midnight, and he felt so much at peace that before he\nknew he was going to sleep he was sleeping. When he awoke he felt a\nlittle dismay at first, but it was soon gone. After all, he had passed\nthe time of waiting in the easiest way, and no enemy had come. The\nmoon and stars were not to be seen, but instinct told him that it was\nnot beyond midnight.",
        "He arose to go, but a slight sound came from the lake, and he stayed.\nIt was merely the cry of the night bird, calling to its mate, one\nwould have said, but Robert’s attention was attracted by an odd\ninflection in it, a strain that seemed familiar. He listened with the\nutmost attention, and when it came a second time, he was so sure that\nhis pulses beat very fast.",
        "Willet and Tayoga, as he had hoped in the day, were out there on the\nlake. It had been foolish of him to think they would come in the full\nsunlight, exposed to every hostile eye. It was their natural course to\napproach in the dark and send a signal that he would know. He imitated\nthe call, a soft, low note, but one that traveled far, and soon the\nanswer came. No more was needed. The circle was complete. Willet and\nTayoga were on the lake and they knew that he was at the foot of the\ncliff, waiting.",
        "He took a long breath of intense relief and delight. Tandakora would\nresume the search for him in the morning, hunting along the crest,\nand he might even find his way to the narrow ledge on which Robert now\nstood, but the lad would be gone across the waters, where he left no\ntrail.",
        "He saw a stout young bush growing on the edge of the lake, and,\nleaning far out while he held on to it with one hand, he watched. He\ndid not repeat the call. One less cautious would have done so, but he\nknew that his friends had located him already and he meant to run\nno risk of telling the warriors also where he stood. Meanwhile, he\nlistened attentively for the sound of the paddles, but many long\nminutes passed before he heard the faint dip, dip that betokened the\napproach of Willet and Tayoga. He never doubted for an instant that\nit was their canoe and again his heart felt that triumphant feeling.\nSurely no man ever had more loyal or braver comrades! If he had\nmalignant enemies he also had staunch friends who more than offset\nthem.",
        "He saw presently a faint shadow, a deeper dark in the darkness, and\nhe uttered very low the soft note of the bird. In an instant came the\nanswer, and then the shadow, turning, glided toward him. A canoe took\nform and shape and he saw in it two figures, which were unmistakably\nthose of Willet and Tayoga, swinging their paddles with powerful\nhands. Again he felt a thrill of joy because these two trusty comrades\nhad come. But it was absurd ever to doubt for an instant that they\nwould come!",
        "He leaned out from the tree to the last inch, and called in a\npenetrating whisper:",
        "“Dave! Tayoga! This way!”",
        "The canoe shifted its course a little, and entered the bushes by\nthe side of Robert, the hunter and the Onondaga putting down their\ndripping paddles, and stepping out in the shallow water. In the\ndusk the great figure of Willet loomed up, more than ever a tower of\nstrength, and the slender but muscular form of Tayoga, the very model\nof a young Indian warrior, seemed to be made of gleaming bronze. Had\nRobert needed any infusion of courage and will their appearance alone\nwould have brought it with them.",
        "“And we have found Dagaeoga again!” said the Onondaga, in a whimsical\ntone.",
        "“No I have found you,” said Robert. “You were lost from me, I was not\nlost from you.”",
        "“It is the same, and I think by your waiting here at midnight that you\nhave been in great peril.”",
        "“So I have been, and I may be yet–and you too. I have been pursued\nby warriors, Tandakora at their head. I have not seen them, but I know\nfrom the venom and persistence of the pursuit that he leads them. I\neluded them by coming down the cliff and hiding among the bushes here.\nI stood in the water all the afternoon.”",
        "“We thought you might be somewhere along the western shore. After we\ndivided for our scout about the lake, the Great Bear and I met as we\nhad arranged, but you did not come. We concluded that the enemy had\ngot in the way, and so we took from its hiding place a canoe which had\nbeen left on a former journey, and began to cruise upon Andiatarocte,\ncalling at far intervals for you.”",
        "He spoke in his usual precise school English and in a light playful\ntone, but Robert knew the depth of his feelings. The friendship of the\nwhite lad and the red was held by hooks of steel like that of Damon\nand Pythias of old.",
        "“I think I heard your first call,” said Robert. “It wasn’t very loud,\nbut never was a sound more welcome, nor can I be too grateful for that\nhabit you have of hiding canoes here and there in the wilderness. It’s\nsaved us all more than once.”",
        "“It is merely the custom of my people, forced upon us by need, and I\nbut follow.”",
        "“It doesn’t alter my gratitude. I see that the canoe is big enough for\nme too.”",
        "“So it is, Dagaeoga. You can enter it. Take my paddle and work.”",
        "The three adjusted their weight in the slender craft, and Robert,\ntaking Willet’s paddle instead of Tayoga’s, they pushed out into the\nlake, while the great hunter sat with his long rifle across his knees,\nwatching for the least sign that the warriors might be coming.",
        "Robert was fully aware that their peril was not yet over–the Indians,\ntoo, might have canoes upon the lake–but he considered that the bulk\nof it had passed. So his heart was light, and, as they shot out toward\nthe middle of Andiatarocte, he talked of the pursuit and the manner in\nwhich he had escaped it.",
        "“I was led the right way by a bird, one that sang,” he said. “Your\nManitou, Tayoga, sent that bird to save me.”",
        "“You don’t really believe it came for that special purpose?” asked the\nhunter.",
        "“Why not?” interrupted the Onondaga. “We do know that miracles are\ndone often. My nation and all the nations of the Hodenosaunee have\nlong known it. If Manitou wishes to stretch out his hand and snatch\nDagaeoga from his foes it is not for us to ask his reason why.”",
        "Willet was silent. He would not say anything to disturb the belief of\nTayoga, he was never one to attack anybody’s religion, besides he was\nnot sure that he did not believe, himself.",
        "“We know too,” continued Tayoga devoutly, “that Tododaho, the mighty\nOnondaga chief who went away to his star more than four hundred years\nago, and who sits there watching over the Hodenosaunee has intervened\nmore than once in our behalf. He is an arm of Manitou and acts for\nhim.”",
        "He looked up. The sky was hidden by the thick darkness. No ray of\nsilver or gray showed anywhere, but the Onondaga knew where lay the\nstar upon which sat his patron saint with the wise snakes, coil on\ncoil, in his hair. He felt that through the banks of mist and vapor\nTododaho was watching over him, and, as long as he tried to live the\nright way taught to him by his fathers, the great Onondaga chieftain\nwould lead him through all perils, even as the bird in brilliant blue\nplumage had shown Robert the path from the pursuit of Tandakora. The\nsublime faith of Tayoga never wavered for an instant.",
        "The wind rose a little, a heavy swell stirred the lake and their light\ncraft swayed with vigor, but the two youths were expert canoemen, none\nbetter in all the wilderness, and it shipped no water. The hunter,\nsitting with his hands on his rifle, did not stir, nor did he speak\nfor a long time. Willet, at that moment, shared the faith of his two\nyounger comrades. He was grateful too because once more they had\nfound Robert, for whom he had all the affection of a father. The three\nreunited were far stronger than the three scattered, and he did not\nbelieve that any force on the lakes or in the mountains could trap\nthem. But his questing eyes watched the vast oblong of the lake,\nlooking continually for a sign, whether that of friend or foe.",
        "“What did you find, Robert?” he asked at last.",
        "“Nothing but the band of Tandakora,” replied the lad, with a light\nlaugh. “I took my way squarely into trouble, and then I had hard work\ntaking it out again. I don’t know what would have happened to me, if\nyou two hadn’t come in the canoe.”",
        "“It seems,” said the Onondaga, in his whimsical precise manner, “that\na large part of our lives, Great Bear, is spent in rescuing Dagaeoga.\nDo you think when we go into the Great Beyond and arrive at the feet\nof Manitou, and he asks us what we have done with our time on earth,\nhe will put it to our credit when we reply that we consumed at least\nten years saving Dagaeoga from his enemies?”",
        "“Yes, Tayoga, we’ll get white marks for it, because Robert has\nalso saved us, and there is no nobler work than saving one’s\nfellow creatures. Manitou knows also that it is hard to live in the\nwilderness and a man must spend a lot of his time escaping death. Look\nto the east, Tayoga, lad, and tell me if you think that’s a point of\nlight on the mountain over there.”",
        "The Onondaga studied intently the dark wall of the east, and presently\nhis eyes picked out a dot against its background, infinitesimal like\nthe light of a firefly, but not to be ignored by expert woodsmen.",
        "“Yes, Great Bear,” he replied, “I see it is not larger than the\nlittlest star, but it moves from side to side, and I think it is a\nsignal.”",
        "“So do I, lad. The lake is narrow here, and the answer, if there be\nany, will come from the west shore. Now we’ll look, all together.\nThree pairs of eyes are better than one.”",
        "The two lads ceased paddling, holding the canoe steady, with\nan occasional stroke, and began to search the western cliffs in\nmethodical fashion, letting the eye travel from the farthest point in\nthe north gradually toward the south, and neglecting no place in the\ndark expanse.",
        "“There it is!” exclaimed Robert. “Almost opposite us! I believe it’s\nin the very cliff at the point of which I lay!”",
        "“See it, winking and blinking away.”",
        "“Yes, that’s it,” said Robert. “Now I wonder what those two lights are\nsaying to each other across Lake George?”",
        "“It might be worth one’s while to know, for they’re surely signaling.\nIt may be about us, or it may be about the army in the south.”",
        "“I didn’t find anything but trouble,” said Robert. “Now what did you\nand Tayoga find?”",
        "“Plenty traces of both white men and red,” replied the hunter. “The\nforests were full of French and Indians. I think St. Luc with a\npowerful force is near the north end of Lake George, and the Marquis\nde Montcalm will soon be at Ticonderoga to meet us.”",
        "“But we’ll sweep him away when our great army comes up from New York.”",
        "“So we should, lad, but the Marquis is an able general, wily and\nbrave. He showed his quality at Fort William Henry and we mustn’t\nunderrate him, though I am afraid that’s what we’ll do; besides the\nforest fights for the defense.”",
        "“It’s not like you to be despondent, Dave,” said Robert.",
        "“I’m not, lad. I’ve just a feeling that we should be mighty cautious.\nSome think the Marquis won’t stand when our big army comes, but I\ndo, and I look for a great battle on the shores of either George or\nChamplain.”",
        "“And we’ll win it,” said Robert in sanguine tones.",
        "“That rests on the knees of the gods,” said Willet thoughtfully. “But\nwe’ve got to deal with one thing at a time. It’s our business now to\nescape from the people who are making those lights wink at each other,\nor the battle wherever it’s fought or whoever wins won’t include us\nbecause we’ll be off on another star, maybe sitting at the feet of\nTayoga’s Tododaho.”",
        "“There’s another light on the west shore toward the south,” said the\nOnondaga.",
        "“And a fourth on the eastern cliff also toward the south,” added\nRobert. “All four of them are winking now. It seems to be a general\nconversation.”",
        "“And I wish we could understand their language,” said the hunter\nearnestly. “I’m thinking, however, that they’re talking about us. They\nmust have found out in some manner that we’re on the lake, and they\nwant to take us.”",
        "“Then,” said Robert, “it’s time for Manitou to send a heavy mist that\nwe may escape in it.”",
        "“Manitou can work miracles for those whom he favors,” said Tayoga,\n\"and now and then he sends them, but oftenest he withholds his hand,\nlest we become spoiled and rely upon him when we should rely upon\nourselves.”",
        "“You never spoke a truer word, Tayoga,” said the hunter. “It’s the\nsame as saying that heaven helps those who help themselves, and we’ve\ngot to do a lot of work for ourselves this night. I think the Indian\ncanoes are already on Andiatarocte looking for us.”",
        "Robert would have felt a chill had it not been for the presence of his\ncomrades. The danger was unknown, mysterious, it might come from any\npoint, and, while the foe prepared, they must wait until he disclosed\nhimself. Waiting was the hardest thing to do.",
        "“I think we’d better stay just where we are for a while,” said the\nhunter. “It would be foolish to use our strength, until we know what\nwe are using it for. It’s certain that Manitou intends to let us fend\nfor ourselves because the night is lightening, which is a hard thing\nfor fugitives.”",
        "The clouds floated away toward the north, a star came out, then\nanother, and then a cluster, the lofty shores on either side rose up\nclear and distinct, no longer vague black walls, the surface of the\nwater turned to gray, but it was still swept by a heavy swell, in\nwhich the canoe rocked. Willet finally suggested that they pull to\na small island lying on their right, and anchor in the heavy foliage\noverhanging the water.",
        "“If it grows much lighter they’ll be able to see us from the cliffs,\"\nhe said, “and for us now situated as we are the most important of all\nthings is to hide.”",
        "It was a tiny island, not more than a quarter of an acre in size, but\nit was covered with heavy forest, and they found refuge among the long\nboughs that touched the water, where they rested in silence, while\nmore stars came out, throwing a silver radiance over the lake. The\nthree were silent and Robert watched the western light that lay\nfarthest south. It seemed to be about two miles away, and, as he\nlooked he saw it grow, until he became convinced that it was no longer\na light, but a fire.",
        "“What is the meaning of it?” he asked, calling the attention of\nWillet.",
        "The hunter looked for a while before replying. The fire still grew\nand soon a light on the eastern shore began to turn into a fire,\nincreasing in the same manner.",
        "“I take it that they intend to illuminate the lake, at least this\nportion of it,” said Willet. “They’ll have gigantic bonfires casting\ntheir light far over the water, and they think that we won’t be able\nto hide then.”",
        "“Which proves that they are in great force on both shores,” said\nTayoga.",
        "“How does it prove it?” asked Robert.",
        "The Onondaga laughed softly.",
        "“O Dagaeoga,” he said, “you speak before you think. You are always\nthinking before you speak, but perhaps it is not your fault. Manitou\ngave you a tongue of gold, and it becomes a man to use that which he\ncan use best. It is very simple. To drag up the fallen wood for such\nbig fires takes many men. Nor would all of them be employed for such\nwork. While some of them feed the flames others are seeking us. We can\nlook for their canoes soon.”",
        "“Their plan isn’t a bad one for what they want to do,” said the\nhunter. “A master mind must be directing them. I am confirmed in my\nopinion that St. Luc is there.”",
        "“I’ve been sure of it all the time,” said Robert; “it seems that fate\nintends us to be continually matching our wits against his.”",
        "“It’s a fact, and it’s strange how it’s come about,” said the hunter\nthoughtfully.",
        "Robert looked at him, hoping he would say more, but he did not\ncontinue the subject. Instead he said:",
        "“That they know what they’re doing is shown by the fact that we must\nmove. All the area of the lake about us will be lighted up soon.”",
        "The two bonfires were now lofty, blazing pyramids, and a third farther\nnorth began also to send its flames toward the sky.",
        "The surface of the lake glowed with red light which crept steadily\ntoward the little island, in the shadow of which the three scouts lay.\nIt became apparent that they had no time to waste, if they intended to\navoid being trapped.",
        "“Push out,” said Willet, and, with strong sweeps of the paddle, Robert\nand Tayoga sent the canoe from the shelter of the boughs. But they\nstill kept close to the island and then made for another about a\nhundred yards south. The glow had not yet come near enough to disclose\nthem, while they were in the open water, but Robert felt intense\nrelief when they drew again into the shelter of trees.",
        "The bonfire on the western shore was the largest, and, despite the\ndistance, he saw passing before the flames tiny black figures which he\nknew to be warriors or French, if any white men were there. They\nwere still feeding the fire and the pyramid of light rose to an\nextraordinary height, but Robert knew the peril was elsewhere. It\nwould come on the surface of the lake and he shifted his gaze to the\ngray waters, searching everywhere for Indian canoes. He believed that\nthey would appear first in the north and he scoured the horizon there\nfrom side to side, trying to detect the first black dot when it should\nshow over the lake.",
        "The waters where his eyes searched were wholly in darkness, an\nunbroken black line of the sky meeting a heaving surface. He looked\nback and forth over the whole extent, a half dozen times, and found\nnothing to break the continuity. Hope that the warriors of Tandakora\nwere not coming sprang up in his breast, but he put it down again.\nAlthough imagination was so strong in him he was nevertheless, in\nmoments of peril, a realist. Hard experience had taught him long since\nthat when his life was in danger he must face facts.",
        "“There’s another island about a half mile away,” he said to Willet.\n\"Don’t you think we’d better make for it now?”",
        "“In a minute or two, lad, if nothing happens,” replied the hunter.\n\"I’d like to see what’s coming here, if anything at all comes.”",
        "Robert turned his gaze back toward the north, passing his eyes once\nmore to and fro along the line where the dusky sky met the dusky lake,\nand then he started a little. A dot detached itself from the center of\nthe line, followed quickly by another, another and others. They were\npoints infinitely small, and one at that distance could have told\nnothing about them from their appearance only, but he knew they were\nIndian canoes. They could be nothing else. It was certain also that\nthey were seeking the three.",
        "“Do you see them?” asked Robert.",
        "“Yes, and it’s a fleet,” replied Willet. “They are lighting up the\nlake with their bonfires, and their canoes are coming south to drive\nus into the open. There’s generalship in this. I think St. Luc is\nsurely in command.”",
        "The hunter expressed frank admiration. Often, in the long duel between\nthem and the redoubtable French leader, he paid tribute to the valor\nand skill of St. Luc. Like Robert, he never felt any hostility toward\nhim. There was nothing small about Willet, and he had abundant esteem\nfor a gallant foe.",
        "“It’s time now to run for it again,” he said, “and it’s important to\nkeep out of their sight.”",
        "“I think it will be better for us to swim,” said Tayoga, “and let the\ncanoe carry our weapons and ammunition.”",
        "“And for us to hide behind it as we’ve done before. You’re right, lad.\nThe canoe is low and does not make much of a blur upon the lake, but\nif we are sitting upright in it we can be much more easily seen. Now,\nquick’s the word!”",
        "They took off all their outer clothing and moccasins, putting the\ngarments and their weapons into the little craft, and, sinking into\nthe water behind it, pushed out from the overhanging boughs. It was\na wise precaution. When they reached the long open stretch of water,\nRobert felt that the glow from the nearest bonfire was directly upon\nthem, although he knew that his fancy made the light much stronger\nthan it really was.",
        "The canoe still merged with the color of the waves which were now\nrunning freely, and, as the three swam with powerful strokes sending\nit swiftly ahead of them, Robert was hopeful that they would reach the\nnext island, unseen.",
        "The distance seemed to lengthen and grow interminable, and their pace,\nalthough rapid, was to Robert like that of a snail. Yet the longest\njourney must come to an end. The new island rose at last before them,\nlarger than the others but like the rest covered throughout with heavy\nforest.",
        "They were almost in its shelter, when a faint cry came from the lofty\ncliff on the west. It was a low, whining sound, very distant,\nbut singularly penetrating, a sinister note with which Robert was\nfamiliar, the Indian war whoop. He recognized it, and understood its\nsignificance. Warriors had seen the canoe and knew that it marked the\nflight of the three.",
        "“What do you think we’d better do?” he said.",
        "“We’ll stop for a moment or two at the island and take a look around\nus,” replied Willet.",
        "They moored the canoe, and waded to the shore. Far behind them was\nthe Indian fleet, about twenty canoes, coming in the formation of\nan arrow, while the bonfires on the cliffs towered toward the sky. A\nrising wind swept the waves down and they crumbled one after another,\nas they broke upon the island.",
        "“It looks like a trap with us inside of it,” said the hunter. “That\nshout meant that they’ve seen our canoe, as you lads know. Warriors\nhave already gone below to head us off, and maybe they’ve got another\nfleet, which, answering their signals, will come up from the south,\nshutting us between two forces.”",
        "“We are in their trap,” admitted Robert, “but we can break out of it.\nWe’ve been in traps before, but none of them ever held us.”",
        "“So we can, lad. I didn’t mean to be discouraging. I was just stating\nthe situation as it now is. We’re a long way from being taken.”",
        "“The path has been opened to us,” said the Onondaga.",
        "“What do you mean?” asked Robert.",
        "“Lo, Dagaeoga, the wind grows strong, and it sweeps toward the south\nthe way we were going.”",
        "“I hear, Tayoga, but I don’t understand.”",
        "“We will send the canoe with wind and waves, but we will stay here.”",
        "“Put ’em on a false scent!” exclaimed the hunter. “It’s a big risk,\nbut it’s the only thing to be done. As the bird saved Robert so the\nwind may save us! The waves are running pretty fast toward the south\nnow and the canoe will ride ’em like a thing of life. They’re too far\naway to tell whether we are in it.”",
        "It was a daring thing to do but Robert too felt that it must be\ndone, and they did not delay in the doing of it. They took out their\nclothing, weapons, and ammunition, Willet gave the canoe a mighty\nshove, and it sailed gallantly southward on the crest of the high\nwaves.",
        "“I feel as if I were saying good-by to a faithful friend,” said\nRobert.",
        "“It’s more than a friend,” said Willet. “It’s an ally that will draw\nthe enemy after it, and leave us here in safety.”",
        "“If Manitou so wills it,” said Tayoga. “It is for him to say whether\nthe men of Tandakora will pass us by. But the canoe is truly alive,\nDagaeoga. It skims over the lake like a great bird. If it has a spirit\nin it, and I do not know that it has not, it guards us, and means to\nlead away our enemy in pursuit of it.”",
        "Quick to receive impressions, Robert also clothed the canoe with life\nand a soul, a soul wholly friendly to the three, who, now stooping\ndown on the island, amid the foliage, watched the action of the little\ncraft which seemed, in truth, to be guided by reason.",
        "“Now it pauses a little,” said Robert. “It’s beckoning to the Indian\nfleet to follow.”",
        "“It is because it hangs on the top of a wave that is about to break,\"\nsaid Willet. “Often you see waves hesitate that way just before they\ncrumble.”",
        "“I prefer to believe with Dagaeoga,” said the Onondaga. “The canoe\nis our ally, and, knowing that we want the warriors to pass us, it\nlingers a bit to call them on.”",
        "“It may be as you say,” said the hunter, “I’m not one to disturb the\nfaith of anybody. If the canoe is alive, as you think, then–it is\nalive and all the better for us.”",
        "“Spirits go into the bodies of inanimate things,” persisted the\nred youth, “and make them alive for a while. All the people of the\nHodenosaunee have known that for centuries.”",
        "“The canoe hesitates and beckons again,” said Robert, “and, as sure\nas we are here, the skies have turned somewhat darker. The warriors in\nthe fleet or on the shore cannot possibly tell the canoe is empty.”",
        "“Again the hand of Manitou is stretched forth to protect us,” said\nTayoga devoutly. “It is he who sends the protecting veil, and we shall\nbe saved.”",
        "“We’ll have to wait and see whether the warriors stop and search our\nisland or follow straight after the canoe. Then we’ll know,” said\nWillet.",
        "“They will go on,” said Tayoga, with great confidence. “Look at\nthe canoe. It is not going so fast now. Why? Because it wishes to\ntantalize our enemies, to arouse in their minds a belief that they\ncan overtake it. It behaves as if we were in it, and as if we were\nbecoming exhausted by our great exertions with the paddles. Its\nconduct is just like that of a man who flees for his life. I know,\nalthough I cannot see their eyes, that the pursuing warriors think\nthey have us now. They believe that our weakness will grow heavier\nand heavier upon us until it overpowers us. Tandakora reckons that our\nscalps are already hanging at his belt. Thus does Manitou make foolish\nthose whom he intends to lead away from their dearest wish.”",
        "“I begin to think they’re really going to leave us, but it’s too early\nyet to tell definitely,” said the hunter. “We shouldn’t give them an\nearthly chance to see us, and, for that reason, we’d better retreat\ninto the heart of the island. We mustn’t leave all the work of\ndeception to the canoe.”",
        "“The Great Bear is right,” said Tayoga. “Manitou will not help those\nwho sit still, relying wholly on him.”",
        "They drew back fifteen or twenty yards, and sat down on a hillock,\ncovered with dense bushes, though from their place of hiding they\ncould see the water on all sides. Unless the Indians landed on the\nisland and made a thorough search they would not be found. Meanwhile\nthe canoe was faithful to its trust. The strong wind out of the north\ncarried it on with few moments of hesitation as it poised on breaking\nwaves, its striking similitude to life never being lost for an\ninstant. Robert began to believe with Tayoga that it was, in very\nfact and truth, alive and endowed with reason. Why not? The Iroquois\nbelieved that spirits could go into wood and who was he to argue that\nwhite men were right, and red men wrong? His life in the forest had\nproved to him often that red men were right and white men wrong.",
        "Whoever might be right the canoe was still a tantalizing object to the\npursuit. It may have been due to a slight shift of the wind, but\nit began suddenly to have the appearance of dancing upon the waves,\nswinging a little to and fro, teetering about, but in the main keeping\nits general course, straight ahead.",
        "Tayoga laughed softly.",
        "“The canoe is in a frolicsome mood,” he said. “It has sport with the\nmen of Tandakora. It dances, and it throws jests at them. It says,\n’You think you can catch me, but you cannot. Why do you come so\nslowly? Why don’t you hurry? I am here. See, I wait a little. I do not\ngo as fast as I can, because I wish to give you a better chance.’ Ah,\nhere comes the fleet!”",
        "“And here comes our supreme test,” said Willet gravely. “If they\nturn in toward the island then we are lost, and we’ll know in five\nminutes.”",
        "Robert’s heart missed a beat or two, and then settled back steadily.\nIt was one thing to be captured by the French, and another to be taken\nby Tandakora. He resolved to fight to the last, rather than fall into\nthe hands of the Ojibway chief who knew no mercy. Neither of the three\nspoke, not even in whispers, as they watched almost with suspended\nbreath the progress of the fleet. The bonfires had never ceased to\nrise and expand. For a long distance the surface of the lake was\nlighted up brilliantly. The crests of the waves near them were tipped\nwith red, as if with blood, and the strong wind moaned like the voice\nof evil. Robert felt a chill in his blood. He knew that the fate of\nhis comrades and himself hung on a hair.",
        "Nearer came the canoes, and, in the glare of the fires, they saw the\noccupants distinctly. In the first boat, a large one for those waters,\ncontaining six paddles, sat no less a person than the great Ojibway\nchief himself, bare as usual to the waist and painted in many a\nhideous design. Gigantic in reality, the gray night and the lurid\nlight of the fires made him look larger, accentuating every wicked\nfeature.",
        "He seemed to Robert to be, in both spirit and body, the prince of\ndarkness himself.",
        "Just behind Tandakora sat two white men whom the three recognized as\nAuguste de Courcelles and François de Jumonville, the French officers\nwith whom they had been compelled to reckon on other fields of battle\nand intrigue. There was no longer any doubt that the French were\npresent in this great encircling movement, and Robert was stronger\nthan ever in his belief that St. Luc had the supreme command.",
        "“I could reach Tandakora from here with a bullet,” whispered Willet,\n\"and almost I am tempted to do it.”",
        "“But the Great Bear will not yield to his temptation,” Tayoga\nwhispered back. “There are two reasons. He knows that he could slay\nTandakora, but it would mean the death of us all, and the price is too\ngreat. Then he remembers that the Ojibway chief is mine. It is for me\nto settle with him, in the last reckoning.”",
        "“Aye, lad, you’re right. Either reason is good enough. We’ll let him\npass, if pass he means, and I hope devoutly that he does.”",
        "The fleet preserving its formation was now almost abreast of the\nisland, and once Robert thought it was going to turn in toward them.\nThe long boat of Tandakora wavered and the red giant looked at the\nisland curiously, but, at the last moment the empty canoe, far ahead\nand dim in the dark, beckoned them on more insistently than ever.",
        "“Now the die is cast,” whispered the Onondaga tensely. “In twenty\nseconds we shall know our fate, and I think the good spirit that has\ngone into our canoe means to save us.”",
        "Tandakora said something to the French officers, and they too looked\nat the island, but the fleeing canoe danced on the crest of a high\nwave and its call was potent in the souls of white men and red alike.\nIt was still too far away for them to tell that it was empty. Sudden\nfear assailed them in the darkness, that it would escape and with it\nthe three who had eluded them so often, and whom they wanted most to\ntake. Tandakora spoke sharply to the paddlers, who bent to their task\nwith increased energy. The long canoe leaped forward, and with it the\nothers.",
        "“Manitou has stretched forth his hand once more, and he has stretched\nit between our enemies and us,” said Tayoga, in a voice of deep\nemotion.",
        "“It’s so, lad,” said the hunter, his own voice shaking a little. “I\ntruly believe you’re right when you say that as the bird was sent to\nsave Robert so a good spirit was put into the canoe to save us all.\nWho am I and who is anybody to question the religion and beliefs of\nanother man?”",
        "“Nor will I question them,” said Robert, with emphasis.",
        "They were stalwart men in the Indian fleet, skilled and enduring with\nthe paddle, and the fugitive canoe danced before them, a will o’\nthe wisp that they must pursue without rest. Their own canoes leaped\nforward, and, as the arrow into which they were formed shot past the\nisland, the three hidden in its heart drew the deep, long breaths of\nthose who have suddenly passed from death to life.",
        "“We won’t stop ’em!” said Robert in a whimsical tone. “Speed ye,\nTandakora, speed ye! Speed ye, De Courcelles and De Jumonville of\ntreacherous memory! If you don’t hasten, the flying canoe will yet\nescape you! More power to your arms, O ye paddlers! Bend to your\nstrokes! The canoe that you pursue is light and it is carried in the\nheart of the wind! You have no time to lose, white men and red, if you\nwould reach the precious prize! The faster you go the better you will\nlike it! And the better we will, too! On! swift canoes, on!”",
        "“The imagination of Dagaeoga has been kindled again,” said Tayoga,\n\"and the bird with a golden note has gone into his throat. Now he\ncan talk, and talk much, without ever feeling weariness–as is his\ncustom.”",
        "“At least I have something to talk about,” laughed Robert. “I was\nnever before so glad to see the backs of anybody, as I am now to look\nat the backs of those Indians and Frenchmen.”",
        "“We won’t do anything to stop ’em,” said the hunter.",
        "From their hillock they saw the fleet sweep on at a great rate toward\nthe south, while the fires in the north, no longer necessary to the\nIndian plan, began to die. The red tint on the water then faded, and\nthe surface of the lake became a solemn gray.",
        "“It’s well for us those fires sank,” said the hunter, “because while\nTandakora has gone on we can’t live all the rest of our lives on this\nlittle island. We’ve got to get to the mainland somehow without being\nseen.”",
        "“And darkness is our best friend,” said Robert.",
        "“So it is, and in their pursuit of the canoe our foes are likely to\nrelax their vigilance on this part of the lake. Can you see our little\nboat now, Robert?”",
        "“Just faintly, and I think it’s a last glimpse. I hope the wind behind\nit will stay so strong that Tandakora will never overtake it. I should\nhate to think that a canoe that has been such a friend to us has been\ncompelled to serve our enemies. There it goes, leading straight ahead,\nand now it’s gone! Farewell, brave and loyal canoe! Now what do you\nintend to do, Dave?”",
        "“Swim to the mainland as soon as those fires sink a little more.\nWe have got to decide when the head of a swimming man won’t show to\nchance warriors in the bushes, and then make a dash for it, because,\nif Tandakora overtakes the canoe, he’ll be coming back.”",
        "“In a quarter of an hour it will be dark enough for us to risk it,\"\nsaid the Onondaga.",
        "Again came the thick dusk so necessary to those who flee for life. Two\nfires on the high cliffs blazed far in the south, but the light from\nthem did not reach the island where the three lay, where peril had\ngrazed them before going on. The water all about them and the nearer\nshores lay in shadow.",
        "“The time to go has come,” said the hunter. “We’ll swim to the western\nside and climb through that dip between the high cliffs.”",
        "“How far would you say it is?” asked Robert.",
        "“About a half mile.”",
        "“Quite a swim even for as good swimmers as we are, when you consider\nwe have to carry our equipment. Why not launch one of those fallen\ntrees that lie near the water’s edge and make it carry us?”",
        "“A good idea, Robert! A happy thought does come now and then into that\nyoung head of yours.”",
        "“Dagaeoga is wiser than he looks,” said the Onondaga.",
        "“I wish I could say the same for you, Tayoga,” retorted young Lennox.",
        "“Oh, you’ll both learn,” laughed Willet.",
        "As in the ancient wood everywhere, there were fallen trees on the\nisland and they rolled a small one about six inches through at the\nstem into the lake. They chose it because it had not been down long\nand yet had many living branches, some with young leaves on them.",
        "“There is enough foliage left to hide our heads and shoulders,” said\nWillet. “The tree will serve a double purpose. It’s our ship and also\nour refuge.”",
        "They took off all their clothing and fastened it and the arms,\nammunition and knapsacks of food on the tree. Then, they pushed\noff, with a caution from the hunter that they must not allow their\nimprovised raft to turn in the water, as the wetting of the ammunition\ncould easily prove fatal.",
        "With a prayer that fortune which had favored them so much thus far\nwould still prove kind, they struck out.",
        "It was only a half mile to the promised land and Robert expected a\nquick and easy voyage, as they were powerful swimmers and could push\nthe tree before them without trouble.",
        "“When I reach the shore and get well back of the lake,” he said to\nTayoga, “I mean to lie down in a thicket and sleep forty-eight hours.\nI am entitled now to a rest that long.”",
        "“Dagaeoga will sleep when the spirits of earth and air decree it, and\nnot before,” replied the Onondaga gravely. “Can you see anything of\nour foes in the south?”",
        "“Not a trace.”",
        "“Then your eyes are not as good as mine or you do not use them as\nwell, because I see a speck on the water blacker than the surface of\nthe lake, and it is moving.”",
        "“Where, Tayoga?”",
        "“Look toward the eastern shore, where the cliff rises tall and almost\nstraight.”",
        "“Ah, I see it now. It is a canoe, and it is moving.”",
        "“So it is, Dagaeoga, and it is coming our way. Did I not tell you that\nManitou, no matter how much he favors us, will not help us all the\ntime? Not even the great and pious Tododaho, when he was on earth,\nexpected so much. Now I think that after saving you with the bird\nand all of us with the empty canoe he means to leave us to our own\nstrength and courage, and see what we will do.”",
        "“And it will be strange, if after being protected so far by a power\ngreater than our own we can’t protect ourselves now,” said Willet\ngravely.",
        "“The canoe is coming fast,” said Tayoga. “I can see it growing on the\nwater.”",
        "“So it is, and I infer from its speed that it has at least four\npaddles in it. There’s no doubt they are disappointed in not finding\nus farther down, and their boat has come back to look for us.”",
        "“This is not the only tree uprooted by the wind and afloat on the\nlake,” said Tayoga, “and now it must be our purpose to make the\nwarriors think it has come into the water naturally.”",
        "Long before the French word “camouflage” was brought into general use\nby a titanic war the art of concealment and illusion was practiced\nuniversally by the natives of the North American wilderness. It was in\ntruth their favorite stratagem in their unending wars, and there was\nhigh praise for those who could use it best.",
        "“Well spoken, Tayoga,” said Willet. “Luckily these living branches\nhide us, and, as the wind still blows strongly toward the south, we\nmust let the tree float in that direction.”",
        "“And not go toward the mainland!” said Robert.",
        "“Aye, lad, for the present. It’s stern necessity. If the warriors in\nthat canoe saw the tree floating against the wind they’d know\nwe’re here. Trust ’em for that. I think we’re about to run another\ngauntlet.”",
        "The trunk now drifted with the wind, though the three edged it ever so\nslightly, but steadily, toward the shore.",
        "Meanwhile the canoe grew and grew, and they saw, as Willet had\nsurmised, that it contained four paddles. It was evident too that they\nwere on a quest, as the boat began to veer about, and the four Indians\nswept the lake with eager eyes.",
        "The tree drifted on. Farther to the west and near the shore, another\ntree was floating in the same manner, and off to the east a third was\nbeckoning in like fashion. There was nothing in the behavior of the\nthree trees to indicate that one of them was different from the other\ntwo.",
        "The eyes of the savages passed over them, one after another, but they\nsaw no human being hidden within their boughs. Yet Robert at least,\nwhen those four pairs of eyes rested on his tree, felt them burning\ninto his back. It was a positive relief, when they moved on and began\nto hunt elsewhere.",
        "“They will yet bring their canoe much closer,” whispered Willet. “It’s\ntoo much to expect that they will let us go so easily, and we’ve got\nto keep up the illusion quite a while longer. Don’t push on the tree.\nThe wind is dying a little, and our pace must be absolutely the pace\nof the breeze. They notice everything and if we were to go too fast\nthey’d be sure to see it.”",
        "They no longer sought to control their floating support, and, as the\nwind suddenly sank very much, it hung lazily on the crests of little\nwaves.",
        "It was a hard test to endure, while the canoe with the four relentless\nwarriors in it rowed about seeking them. Robert paid all the price of\na vivid and extremely brilliant imagination. While those with such a\ntemperament look far ahead and have a vision of triumphs to come out\nof the distant future, they also see far more clearly the troubles\nand dangers that confront them. So their nerves are much more severely\ntried than are those of the ordinary and apathetic. Great will power\nmust come to their relief, and thus it was with Robert. His body\nquivered, though not with the cold of the water, but his soul was\nsteady.",
        "Although the wind sank, which was against them, the darkness\nincreased, and the fact that two other trees were afloat within\nview, was greatly in their favor. It gave them comrades in that lazy\ndrifting and diverted suspicion.",
        "“If they conclude to make a close examination of our tree, what shall\nwe do?” whispered Robert.",
        "“We’ll be at a great disadvantage in the water,” the hunter whispered\nback, “but we’ll have to get our rifles loose from their lashings and\nmake a fight of it. I’m hoping it won’t come to that.”",
        "The canoe approached the tree and then veered away again, as if the\nwarriors were satisfied with its appearance. Certainly a tree more\ninnocent in looks never floated on the waves of Lake George.",
        "The three were masters of illusion and deception, and they did not do\na single thing to turn the tree from its natural way of drifting. It\nobeyed absolutely the touch of the wind and not that of their hands,\nwhich rested as lightly as down upon the trunk. Once the wind stopped\nentirely and the tree had no motion save that of the swell. It\nwandered idly, a lone derelict upon a solitary lake.",
        "Robert scarcely breathed when the canoe was sent their way. He was\nwholly unconscious of the water in which he was sunk to the shoulders,\nbut every imaginative nerve was alive to the immense peril.",
        "“If they return and come much nearer we must immerse to the eyes,\"\nwhispered Willet. “Then they would have to be almost upon us before\nthey saw us. It will make it much harder for us to get at our weapons,\nbut we must take that risk too.”",
        "“They have turned,” said Robert, “and here they come!”",
        "It looked this time as if the savages had decided to make a close and\ncareful inspection of the tree, bearing directly toward it, and coming\nso close that Robert could see their fierce, painted faces well and\nthe muscles rising and falling on their powerful arms as they swept\ntheir paddles through the water. Now, he prayed that the foliage of\nthe tree would hide them well and he sank his body so deep in the lake\nthat a little water trickled into his mouth, while only the tips of\nhis fingers rested on the trunk. The hunter and the Onondaga were\nsubmerged as deeply as he, the upper parts of their faces and their\nhair blending with the water. When he saw how little they were\ndisclosed in the dusk his confidence returned.",
        "The four savages brought the canoe within thirty feet, but the\nfloating tree kept its secret. Its lazy drift was that of complete\ninnocence and their eyes could not see the dark heads that merged so\nwell with the dark trunk. They gazed for a half minute or so, then\nbrought their canoe about in a half circle and paddled swiftly away\ntoward the second tree.",
        "“Now Tododaho on his star surely put it in their minds to go away,\"\nwhispered the Onondaga, “and I do not think they will come back\nagain.”",
        "“Even so, we can’t yet make haste,” said the hunter cautiously. “If\nthis tree seems to act wrong they’ll see it though at a long distance\nand come flying down on us.”",
        "“The Great Bear is right, as always, but the wind is blowing again,\nand we can begin to edge in toward the shore.”",
        "“So we can. Now we’ll push the tree slowly toward the right. All\ntogether, but be very gentle. Robert, don’t let your enthusiasm run\naway with you. If we depart much from the course of the wind they’ll\nbe after us again no matter how far away they are now.”",
        "“They have finished their examination of the second tree,” said Tayoga\nin his precise school English, “and now they are going to the third,\nwhich will take them a yet greater distance from us.”",
        "“So they are. Fortune is with us.”",
        "They no longer felt it necessary to keep submerged to the mouth, but\ndrew themselves up, resting their elbows on the trunk, floating easily\nin the buoyant water. They had carefully avoided turning the tree in\nany manner, and their arms, ammunition and packs were dry and safe.\nBut they had been submerged so long that they were growing cold, and\nnow that the immediate danger seemed to have been passed they realized\nit.",
        "“I like Lake George,” said Robert. “It’s a glorious lake, a beautiful\nlake, a majestic lake, the finest lake I know; but that is no reason\nwhy I should want to live in its waters.”",
        "“Dagaeoga is never satisfied,” said Tayoga. “He might have been sunk\nin some shallow, muddy lake in a flat country, but instead he is\nput in this noble one with its beautiful cool waters, and the grand\nmountains are all about him.”",
        "“But this is the second time I’ve been immersed in a very short space,\nTayoga, and just now I crave dry land. I can’t recall a single hour or\na single moment when I ever wanted it more than I do this instant.”",
        "“I’m of a mind with you in that matter, Robert,” said the hunter, “and\nif all continues to go as well as it’s now going, we’ll set foot on it\nin fifteen minutes. That canoe is close to the third tree, and they’ve\nstopped to look at it. I think we can push a little faster toward the\nland. They can’t notice our slant at that distance. Aye, that’s\nright, lads! Now the cliffs are coming much nearer, and they look real\nfriendly. I see a little cove in there where our good tree can land,\nand it won’t be hard for us to find our way up the banks, though they\ndo rise so high. Now, steady! In we go! It’s a snug little cove, put\nhere to receive us. Be cautious how you rise out of the water, lads!\nThose fellows see like owls in the dark, and they’d trace us outlined\nhere against the shore. That’s it, Tayoga, you always do the right\nthing. We’ll crawl out of the lake behind this little screen of\nbushes. Now, have you lads got all your baggage loose from the tree?”",
        "“Yes,” replied Robert.",
        "“Then we’ll let it go.”",
        "“It’s been a fine tree, a kind tree,” said Robert, “and I’ve no doubt\nTayoga is right when he thinks a good spirit friendly to us has gone\ninto it.”",
        "They pushed it off and saw it float again on the lake, borne on by\nthe wind. Then they dried their bodies as well as they could in their\nhaste, and resumed their clothing. The hunter shook his gigantic\nframe, and he felt the strength pour back into his muscles and veins,\nwhen he grasped his rifle. It had been his powerful comrade for many\nyears, and he now stood where he could use it with deadly effect, if\nthe savages should come.",
        "They rested several minutes, before beginning the climb of the cliff,\nand saw a second and then a third canoe coming out of the south,\nevidently seeking them.",
        "“They’re pretty sure now that we haven’t escaped in that direction,\"\nsaid Willet, “and they’ll be back in full force, looking for us. We\ngot off the lake just in time.”",
        "The cliffs towered over them to a height of nearly two thousand feet,\nbut they began the ascent up a slanting depression that they had seen\nfrom the lake, well covered with bushes, and they took it at ease,\nlooking back occasionally to watch the futile hunt of the canoes for\nthem.",
        "“We’re not out of their ring yet,” said Willet. “They’ll be carrying\non another search for us on top of the cliffs.”",
        "“Don’t discourage us, Dave,” said Robert. “We feel happy now having\nescaped one danger, and we won’t escape the other until we come to\nit.”",
        "“Perhaps you’re right, lad. We’ll enjoy our few minutes of safety\nwhile we can and the sight of those canoes scurrying around the lake,\nlooking for their lost prey, will help along our merriment.”",
        "“That’s true,” said Robert, “and I think I’ll take a glance at them\nnow just to soothe my soul.”",
        "They were about three quarters of the way up the cliff, and the three,\nturning at the same time, gazed down at a great height upon the vast\nexpanse of Lake George. The night had lightened again, a full moon\ncoming out and hosts of stars sparkling in the heavens. The surface of\nthe lake gleamed in silver and they distinctly saw the canoes cruising\nabout in their search for the three. They also saw far in the south\na part of the fleet returning, and Robert breathed a sigh of\nthankfulness that they had escaped at last from the water.",
        "They turned back to the top, but the white lad felt a sudden faintness\nand had he not clung tightly to a stout young bush he would have gone\ncrashing down the slope. He quickly recovered himself and sought to\nhide his momentary weakness, but the hunter had noticed his stumbling\nstep and gave him a keen, questing glance. Then he too stopped.",
        "“We’ve climbed enough,” he said. “Robert, you’ve come to the end of\nyour rope, for the present. It’s a wonder your strength didn’t give\nout long ago, after all you’ve been through.”",
        "“Oh, I can go on! I’m not tired at all!” exclaimed the youth\nvaliantly.",
        "“The Great Bear tells the truth, Dagaeoga,” said the Onondaga, looking\nat him with sympathy, “and you cannot hide it from us. We will seek a\ncovert here.”",
        "Robert knew that any further effort to conceal his sudden exhaustion\nwould be in vain. The collapse was too complete, but he had nothing to\nbe ashamed of, as he had gone through far more than Willet and Tayoga,\nand he had reached the limit of human endurance.",
        "“Well, yes, I am tired,” he admitted. “But as we’re hanging on the\nside of a cliff about fifteen hundred feet above the water I don’t see\nany nice comfortable inn, with big white beds in it, waiting for us.”",
        "“Stay where you are, Dagaeoga,” said the Onondaga. “We will not try\nthe summit to-night, but I may find some sort of an alcove in the\ncliff, a few feet of fairly level space, where we can rest.”",
        "Robert sank down by the friendly bush, with his back against a great\nuplift of stone, while Willet stood on a narrow shelf, supporting\nhimself against a young evergreen. Tayoga disappeared silently upward.",
        "The painful contraction in the chest of the lad grew easier, and black\nspecks that had come before his eyes floated away. He returned to\na firm land of reality, but he knew that his strength was not yet\nsufficient to permit of their going on. Tayoga came back in about ten\nminutes.",
        "“I have found it,” he said in his precise school English. “It is not\nmuch, but about three hundred feet from the top of the cliff is a\nslight hollow that will give support for our bodies. There we may lie\ndown and Dagaeoga can sleep his weariness away.”",
        "“Camping securely between our enemies above and our enemies below,\"\nsaid Robert, his vivid imagination leaping up again. “It appeals to\nme to be so near them and yet well hidden, especially as we’ve left no\ntrail on this rocky precipice that they can follow.”",
        "“It would help me a lot if they were not so close,” laughed the\nhunter. “I don’t need your contrasts, Robert, to make me rest. I’d\nlike it better if they were a hundred miles away instead of only a\nfew hundred yards. But lead on, Tayoga, and we’ll say what we think of\nthis inn of yours when we see it.”",
        "The hollow was not so bad, an indentation in the stone, extending\nback perhaps three feet, and almost hidden by dwarfed evergreens and\nclimbing vines. It was not visible twenty feet above or below, and it\nwould have escaped any eye less keen than that of the Onondaga.",
        "“You’ve done well, Tayoga,” said Willet. “There are better inns in\nAlbany and New York, but it’s a pretty good place to be found in the\nside of a cliff fifteen hundred feet above the water.”",
        "“We’ll be snug enough here.”",
        "They crawled into the hollow, matted the vines carefully in front of\nthem to guard against a slip or an incautious step, and then the three\nlay back against the wall, feeling an immense relief. While not so\nworn as Robert, the bones and muscles of Willet and Tayoga also were\ncalling out for rest.",
        "“I’m glad I’m here,” said the hunter, and the others were forced to\nlaugh at his intense earnestness.",
        "Robert sank against the wall of the cliff, and he felt an immense\npeace. The arching stone over his head, and the dwarfed evergreens\npushing themselves up where the least bit of soil was to be found,\nshut out the view before them, but it was as truly an inn to him at\nthat moment as any he had ever entered. He closed his eyes in content\nand every nerve and muscle relaxed.",
        "“Since you’ve shut down your lids, lad, keep ’em down,” said the\nhunter. “Sleep will do you more good now than anything else.”",
        "But Robert quickly opened his eyes again.",
        "“No,” he said, “I think I’ll eat first.”",
        "Willet laughed.",
        "“I might have known that you would remember your appetite,” he said.\n\"But it’s not a bad idea. We’ll all have a late supper.”",
        "They had venison and cold hominy from their knapsacks, and they ate\nwith sharp appetites.",
        "Then Robert let his lids fall again and in a few minutes was off to\nslumberland.",
        "“Now you follow him, Tayoga,” said Willet, “and I’ll watch.”",
        "“But remember to awake me for my turn,” said the Onondaga.",
        "“You can rely upon me,” said the hunter.",
        "The disciplined mind of Tayoga knew how to compel sleep, and on this\noccasion it was needful for him to exert his will. In an incredibly\nbrief time he was pursuing Robert through the gates of sleep to the\nblessed land of slumber that lay beyond, and the hunter was left alone\non watch.",
        "Willet, despite his long life in the woods, was a man of cultivation\nand refinement. He knew and liked the culture of the cities in its\nhighest sense. His youth had not been spent in the North American\nwilderness. He had tasted the life of London and Paris, and long use\nand practice had not blunted his mind to the extraordinary contrasts\nbetween forest and town.",
        "He appreciated now to the full their singular situation, practically\nhanging on the side of a mighty cliff, with cruel enemies seeking them\nbelow and equally cruel enemies waiting for them above.",
        "The crevice in which they lay was little more than a dent in the stone\nwall. If either of the lads moved a foot and the evergreens failed to\nhold him he would go spinning a quarter of a mile straight down to the\nlake. The hunter looked anxiously in the dusk at the slender barrier,\nbut he judged that it would be sufficient to stop any unconscious\nmovement. Then he glanced at Robert and Tayoga and he was reassured.\nThey were so tired and sleep had claimed them so completely that they\nlay like the dead. Neither stirred a particle, but in the silence the\nhunter heard their regular breathing.",
        "The years had not made Willet a skeptic. While he did not accept\nunquestioningly all the beliefs of Tayoga, neither did he wholly\nreject them. It might well be true that earth, air, trees and other\nobjects were inhabited by spirits good or bad. At least it was a\npleasing belief and he had no proof that it was not true. Certainly,\nit seemed as if some great protection had been given to his comrades\nand himself in the last day or two. He looked up through the evergreen\nveil at the peaceful stars, and gave thanks and gratitude.",
        "The night continued to lighten. New constellations swam into the\nheavenly blue, and the surface of the lake as far as eye could range\nwas a waving mass of molten silver. The portion of the Indian fleet\nthat had come back from the south was passing. It was almost precisely\nopposite the covert now and not more than three hundred yards from the\nbase of the cliff. The light was so good that Willet distinctly saw\nthe paddlers at work and the other warriors sitting upright. It was\nnot possible to read eyes at such a distance, but he imagined what\nthey expressed and the thought pleased him. As Robert had predicted,\nthe snugness of their hiding place with savages above and savages\nbelow heightened his feeling of comfort and safety. He was in sight\nand yet unseen. They would never think of the three hanging there in\nthe side of the cliff. He laughed softly, under his breath, and he had\nnever laughed with more satisfaction.",
        "He tried to pick out Tandakora, judging that his immense size would\ndisclose him, but the chief was not there. Evidently he was with the\nother part of the fleet and was continuing the vain search in the\nsouth. He laughed again and with the same satisfaction when he thought\nof the Ojibway’s rage because the hated three had slipped once more\nthrough his fingers.",
        "“An Ojibway has no business here in the province of New York, anyway,\"\nhe murmured. “His place is out by the Great Lakes.”",
        "The canoes passed on, and, after a while, nothing was to be seen on\nthe waves of Lake George. Even the drifting trees, including the one\nthat had served them so well, had gone out of sight. The lake only\nexpressed peace. It was as it might have been in the dawn of time with\nthe passings of no human beings to vex its surface.",
        "Something stirred in the bushes near the hunter. An eagle, with great\nspread of wing, rose from a nest and sailed far out over the silvery\nwaters. Willet surmised that the nearness of the three had disturbed\nit, and he was sorry. He had a kindly feeling toward birds and beasts\njust then, and he did not wish to drive even an eagle from his home.\nHe hoped that it would come back, and, after a while, it did so,\nsettling upon its nest, which could not have been more than fifty\nyards away, where its mate had remained unmoving while the other went\nabroad to hunt.",
        "There was no further sign of life from the people of the wilderness,\nand Willet sat silent a long time. Dawn came, intense and brilliant.\nHe had hoped the day would be cloudy, and he would have welcomed rain,\ndespite its discomfort, but the sun was in its greatest splendor, and\nthe air was absolutely translucent. The lake and the mountains sprang\nout, sharp and clear. Far to the south the hunter saw a smudge upon\nthe water which he knew to be Indian canoes. They were miles away, but\nit was evident that the French and Indians still held the lake, and\nthere was no escape for the three by water. There had been some idea\nin Willet’s mind of returning along the foot of the cliffs to their\nown little boat, but the brilliant day and the Indian presence\ncompelled him to put it away.",
        "The sun, huge, red and scintillating, swung clear of the mighty\nmountains, and the waters that had been silver in the first morning\nlight turned to burning gold. In the shining day far came near and\nobjects close by grew to twice their size. To attempt to pass the\nwarriors in such a light would be like walking on an open plain,\nthought the hunter, and, always quick to decide, he took his\nresolution.",
        "It was characteristic of David Willet that no matter what the\nsituation he always made the best of it. His mind was a remarkable\nmingling of vigor, penetration and adaptability. If one had to wait,\nwell, one had to wait and there was nothing else in it. He sank down\nin the little cove in the cliff and rested his back against the stony\nwall. He, Robert and Tayoga filled it, and his moccasined feet touched\nthe dwarfed shrubs which made the thin green curtain before the\nopening. He realized more fully now in the intense light of a\nbrilliant day what a slender shelf it was. Any one of them might have\npitched from it to a sure death below. He was glad that the white lad\nand the red lad had been so tired that they lay like the dead. Their\npositions were exactly the same as when they sank to sleep. They had\nnot stirred an inch in the night, and there was no sign now that\nthey intended to awake any time soon. If they had gone to the land of\ndreams, they were finding it a pleasant country and they were in no\nhurry to return from it.",
        "The giant hunter smiled. He had promised the Onondaga to awaken him at\ndawn, and he knew that Robert expected as much, but he would not keep\nhis promise. He would let nature hold sway; when it chose to awaken\nthem it could, and meanwhile he would do nothing. He moved just a\nlittle to make himself more comfortable and reclined patiently.",
        "Willet was intensely grateful for the little curtain of evergreens.\nWithout it the sharp eyes of the warriors could detect them even in\nthe side of the lofty cliff. Only a few bushes stood between them and\ntorture and death, but they stood there just the same. Time passed\nslowly, and the morning remained as brilliant as ever. He paid little\nattention to what was passing on the lake, but he listened with all\nthe power of his hearing for anything that might happen on the cliff\nabove them. He knew that the warriors were far from giving up the\nchase, and he expected a sign there. About two hours after sunrise it\ncame. He heard the cry of a wolf, and then a like cry replying, but\nhe knew that the sounds came from the throats of warriors. He pressed\nhimself a little harder against the stony wall, and looked at his two\nyoung comrades. Their souls still wandered in the pleasant land of\ndreams and their bodies took no interest in what was occurring here.\nThey did not stir.",
        "In four or five minutes the two cries were repeated much nearer\nand the hunter fairly concentrated all his powers into the organ of\nhearing. Faint voices, only whispers, floated down to him, and he\nknew that the warriors were ranging along the cliff just above them.\nLeaning forward cautiously, he peeped above the veil of evergreens,\nand saw two dark faces gazing over the edge of the precipice. A brief\nlook was enough, then he drew back and waited.",
        "Willet knew from their paint that the faces looking down were those of\nHuron warriors, but he was quite sure they had not seen anything,\nand that the men would soon pass on. It was impossible even for the\nsharpest eyes to pick out the three behind the evergreen screen.\nNevertheless he put his rifle forward, ready for an instant shot, if\nneeded, but remained absolutely still, waiting for them to make the\nnext move.",
        "His sensitive hearing brought down the faint voices again and once\nor twice the light crush of footsteps. Evidently, the warriors were\nmoving slowly along the edge of the cliff, talking as they went,\nand the hunter surmised that the three were the subject of their\nattention. He imagined their chagrin at the way in which the chase had\nvanished, and he laughed softly to think that he and the lads lay so\nnear their enemies, but invisible and so well hidden.",
        "The voices became fainter and died away, the soft crush of footsteps\ncame no more, and the world returned to all the seeming of peace,\nwithout any trace of cruelty in it; but Willet was not lured by such\nan easy promise into any rash act. He knew the savages would come\nagain, and that unbroken vigilance was the price of life. Once more he\nsettled himself into the easiest position and watched. He had all the\npatience of the Indians themselves, to whom time mattered little, and\nsince sitting there was the best thing to be done he was content to\nsit there.",
        "Robert and Tayoga slept on. The morning was far gone, but they still\nrambled happily in the land of dreams, and showed no signs of a wish\nto return to earth. Willet thought it better that they should sleep\non, because youthful bodies demanded it, and because the delay which\nwould be hard for Robert especially would thus pass more easily. He\nwas willing for them to stay longer in the far, happy land that they\nwere visiting.",
        "The sun slowly climbed the eastern arch of the heavens. The day lost\nnone of its intense, vivid quality. The waters of the lake glowed in\nwonderful changing colors, now gold, now silver, and then purple or\nblue. Willet even in those hours of anxiety did not forget to steep\nhis soul in the beauty of Lake George. His life was cast amid great\nand continuous dangers, and he had no family that he could call his\nown. Yet he had those whom he loved, and if he were to choose over\nagain the land in which to live he would choose this very majestic\nland in which he now sat. As human life went, the great hunter was\nhappy.",
        "The sound of a shot, and then of a second, came from the cliff\nabove. He heard no cry following them, no note of the war whoop, and,\nthinking it over, he concluded that the shots were fired by Indians\nhunting. Since the war, game about the lake had increased greatly, and\nthe warriors, whether attached to the French army or roving at their\nown will, relied chiefly upon the forest for food. But the reports\nwere significant. The Indian ring about them was not broken, and he\nmeasured their own supplies of venison and hominy.",
        "A little after noon Tayoga awoke, and he awoke in the Indian fashion,\nwithout the noise of incautious movements or sudden words, but\nstepping at once from complete sleep to complete consciousness. Every\nfaculty in him was alive.",
        "“I have slept long, Great Bear, and it is late,” he said.",
        "“But not too late, Tayoga. There’s nothing for us to do.”",
        "“Then the warriors are still above!”",
        "“I heard two shots a little while ago. I think they came from\nhunters.”",
        "“It is almost certainly so, Great Bear, since there is nothing in this\nregion for them to shoot at save ourselves, and no bullets have landed\nnear us.”",
        "“Yours has been a peaceful sleep. Robert too is now coming out of his\ngreat slumber.”",
        "The white lad stirred and murmured a little as he awoke. His reentry\ninto the world of fact was not quite as frictionless as that of his\nIndian comrade.",
        "“Do not fall down the cliff while you stretch yourself, Dagaeoga,\"\nsaid the Onondaga.",
        "“I won’t, Tayoga. I’ve no wish to reach the lake in such fashion. I\nsee by the sun that it’s late. What happened while I slept?”",
        "“Two great attacks by Tandakora and his men were beaten off by the\nGreat Bear and myself. As we felt ourselves a match for them we did\nnot consider it necessary to awaken you.”",
        "“But of course if you had been pushed a bit harder you would have\ncalled upon me. I’m glad you’ve concluded to use me for tipping the\nscales of a doubtful combat. To enter at the most strenuous moment is\nwhat I’m fitted for best.”",
        "“And if your weapons are not sufficient, Dagaeoga, you can make a\nspeech to them and talk them to death.”",
        "The hunter smiled. He hoped the boys would always be willing to jest\nwith each other in this manner. It was good to have high spirits in a\ncrisis.",
        "“Take a little venison and hominy, lads,” he said, “because I think\nwe’re going to spend some time in this most spacious and hospitable\ninn of ours.”",
        "They ate and then were thirsty, but they had no water, although it\nfloated peacefully in millions of gallons below.",
        "“We’re dry, but I think we’re going to be much dryer,” said Willet.",
        "“We must go down one by one in the night for water,” said Tayoga.",
        "“We are to reckon on a long stay, then!” said Robert.",
        "“Yes,” said Willet, “and we might as well make ourselves at home. It’s\na great climb down, but we’ll have to do it.”",
        "“If I could get up and walk about it would be easier,” said Robert. “I\nthink my muscles are growing a bit stiff from disuse.”",
        "“The descent for water to-night will loosen them up,” said Willet\nphilosophically.",
        "It was a tremendously long afternoon, one of the longest that Robert\never spent, and his position grew cramped and difficult. He found some\nrelief now and then in stretching his muscles, but there was nothing\nto assuage the intense thirst that assailed all three. Robert’s throat\nand mouth were dry and burning, and he looked longingly at the lake\nthat shimmered and gleamed below them. The waters, sparkling in their\nbrilliant and changing colors, were cool and inviting. They bade him\ncome, and his throat grew hotter and hotter, but he would make no\ncomplaint. He must endure it in silence all the afternoon, and all the\nnext day too, if they should be held there.",
        "Late in the afternoon they heard shots again, but they were quite sure\nthat the reports, as before, were due to Indian hunters. Rogers with\nrangers might be somewhere in the region of the lakes, but they did\nnot think he was anywhere near them. If a skirmish was occurring on\nthe cliff they would hear the shouts of the combatants.",
        "“The warriors will have a feast to-night,” said Tayoga.",
        "“And they will have plenty of water to drink,” said Robert ruefully.\n\"You remember that time when we were on the peak, and we found the\nspring in the slope?”",
        "“But there is no spring here,” said Tayoga. “We know that because we\ncame up the cliff. There is no water for us this side of the lake.”",
        "The afternoon, long as it was, ended at last. The intense burning\nsunlight faded, and the cool, grateful shadows came. The three stirred\nin the niche, and Robert felt a little relief. But his throat and\nmouth were still dry and hard, and they pained him whenever he talked.\nYet they forced themselves to eat a scant supper, although the food\nincreased their thirst, but they knew that without it their strength\nwould decrease, and they expected to obtain water in the dark.",
        "The twilight passed, night came, but they waited with infinite\npatience refusing to move too soon, despite their great thirst.\nInstead, Tayoga suggested that he go to the crest of the cliff and\nsee if there was a possible way out for them in that direction. Willet\nagreed, and the Onondaga crept up, without sound, disappearing in a\nfew seconds among the short bushes that hung in the face of the cliff.",
        "Tayoga was a trailer of surpassing skill, and he reached the top\nwithout rustling a bush or sending a single pebble rolling. Then he\npeered cautiously over the rim and beheld a great fire burning not\nmore than a hundred yards away. Thirty or forty warriors were sitting\naround it, eating. He did not see Tandakora among them, but he\nsurmised, that it was an allied band and that the Ojibway was not far\noff.",
        "The feast that the three had expected was in full progress. The hunt\nhad been successful, and the Indians, with their usual appetites, were\nenjoying the results. They broiled or roasted great pieces of deer\nover the coals, and then devoured them to the last shred. But Tayoga\nsaw that while the majority were absorbed in their pleasant task, a\nhalf dozen sentinels, their line extending on either side of the camp,\nkept vigilant watch. It would be impossible for the three to pass\nthere. They would have to go down to the lake for water, and then hide\nin their niche.",
        "Tayoga was about to turn back from the cliff, when he heard a shout\nthat he knew was full of significance. He understood the meaning of\nevery cry and he translated it at once into a note of triumph. It\nsounded like the whoop over the taking of a scalp or the capture of a\nprisoner, and his curiosity was aroused. Something had happened, and\nhe was resolved to see what it was.",
        "Several of the warriors by the fire replied to the whoop, and then it\ncame again, nearer but with exactly the same note, that of triumph.\nThe Onondaga flattened his body against the earth, and drew himself a\nlittle higher. In the dusk, his black eyes glowed with interest, but\nhe knew that his curiosity would soon be gratified. Those who had sent\nforth the cry were swiftly approaching the camp.",
        "Four warriors came through the undergrowth and they were pushing a\nfigure before them. It was that of a man in a bedraggled and torn red\nuniform, his hands tied behind him, and all the color gone from his\nface. Powerful as was his self-control, Tayoga uttered a low cry of\nsurprise. It was the young Englishman, Grosvenor, a prisoner of the\nhostile warriors, and in a most desperate case.",
        "The Onondaga wondered how he had been taken, but whatever the way, he\nwas in the hands of enemies who knew little mercy.",
        "The warriors around the fire uttered a universal yell of triumph when\nthey saw the captain, and many of them ran forward to meet Grosvenor,\nwhirling their tomahawks and knives in his face, and dancing about as\nif mad with joy. It was a truly ferocious scene, the like of which was\nwitnessed thousands of times in the great North American forests, and\nTayoga, softened by long contact with high types of white men, felt\npity. The light from the great fire fell directly on Grosvenor’s face\nand showed its pallor. It was evident that he was weary through and\nthrough, but he tried to hold himself erect and he did not flinch when\nthe sharp blades flashed close to his face. But Tayoga knew that his\nfeelings had become blunted. Only the trained forest runner could keep\nsteady in the face of such threats.",
        "When they came near the fire, one of the warriors gave Grosvenor a\npush, and he fell amid cruel laughter. But he struggled to his feet\nagain, stood a few minutes, and then sank down on a little hillock,\nwhere his captors left him alone for the present. Tayoga watched him\nthoughtfully. He knew that his presence in the Indian camp complicated\ntheir own situation. Robert would never hear of going away without an\nattempt at rescue and Tayoga’s own good heart moved him to the same\ncourse. Yet it would be almost impossible to take the young Englishman\nfrom the center of the Indian camp.",
        "Tayoga knew too what grief his news would cause to young Lennox,\nbetween whom and Grosvenor a great friendship had been formed. For\nthe matter of that, both the Onondaga and the hunter also were very\npartial to the Englishman.",
        "The warriors presently untied Grosvenor’s hands and gave him some\nfood. The captive ate a little–he had no appetite for more–and then\ntried to smooth out his hair and his clothing and to make himself more\npresentable. He also straightened his worn figure, and sat more erect.\nTayoga gave silent approval. Here was a man! He might be a prisoner,\nand be in a most desperate plight, but he would present the best\npossible face to his foes. It was exactly what an Onondaga or a Mohawk\nwarrior would do, and the young Englishman, though he knew little of\nthe forest, was living up to its traditions.",
        "“If he has to die,” reflected Tayoga, “he will die well. If his people\nhear that he has gone they will have no cause to be ashamed of the way\nin which he went. Here is the making of a great white warrior.”",
        "The Onondaga knew that Robert and Willet were now expecting him back,\nbut his interest in Grosvenor kept him a while longer, watching at the\ncliff’s rim. He thought it likely that Tandakora might come, and\nhe had not long to wait. The huge Ojibway came striding through the\nbushes and into the circle of the firelight, his body bare as usual\nsave for breech cloth, leggins and moccasins, and painted with the\nhideous devices so dear to the savage heart.",
        "The warriors received him with deference, indicating clearly to Tayoga\nthat they were under his authority, but without making any reply to\ntheir salutation he strode up to the prisoner, and, folding his arms\nacross his mighty breast, regarded him, smiling cruelly. The Onondaga\ndid not see the smile, but he knew it was there. The man would not be\nTandakora if it were not. In that savage heart, the chivalry that so\noften marked the Indians of the higher type found no place.",
        "Grosvenor, worn to the bone and dazed by the extraordinary and fearful\nsituation in which he found himself, nevertheless straightened up\nanew, and gave back defiantly the stare of the gigantic and sinister\nfigure that confronted him. Then Tayoga saw Tandakora raise his hand\nand strike the young Englishman a heavy blow in the face. Grosvenor\nfell, but sprang up instantly and rushed at the Ojibway, only to find\nhimself before the point of a knife.",
        "The young officer stood still a few minutes, then turned with dignity\nand sat down once more. Tayoga knew and appreciated his feelings. He\nhad suffered exactly the same humiliation from Tandakora himself, and\nhe meant, with all his soul, that some day the debt should be paid\nin full. Now in a vicarious way he took upon himself Grosvenor’s debt\nalso. The prisoner did not have experience in the woods, his great\nmerits lay elsewhere, but he was the friend of Robert, therefore of\nTayoga, and the Onondaga felt it only right that he should pay for\nboth.",
        "Tandakora sat down, a warrior handed him a huge piece of deer meat,\nand he began to eat. All the others, interrupted for a few minutes by\nthe arrival of the chief, resumed the same pleasant occupation. Tayoga\ndeciding that he had seen enough, began to climb down with great care.\nThe descent was harder than the ascent, but he reached the niche,\nwithout noise, and the sight of him was very welcome to Robert and the\nhunter who had begun to worry over his absence, which was much longer\nthan they had expected.",
        "“Did you see the warriors, Tayoga?” asked young Lennox.",
        "“I saw them, Dagaeoga. They are at the top of the cliff, only two or\nthree hundred yards away; they have a good fire, and they are eating\nthe game they killed in the day.”",
        "“And there is no chance for us to pass?”",
        "“None to-night, Dagaeoga. Nor would we pass if we could.”",
        "“Why not? I see no reason for our staying here save that we have to do\nit.”",
        "“One is there, Dagaeoga, whom we cannot leave a prisoner in their\nhands.”",
        "“Who? It’s not Black Rifle! Nor Rogers, the ranger! They would never\nlet themselves be taken!”",
        "“No, Dagaeoga, it is neither of those. But while I watched at the\ncliff’s rim I saw the warriors bring in that young Englishman,\nGrosvenor, whom you know and like so well.”",
        "“What! Grosvenor! What could he have been doing in this forest!”",
        "“That, I know not, Dagaeoga, save that he has been getting himself\ncaptured; how, I know not either, but I saw him brought in a prisoner.\nTandakora came, while I watched, and smote the captive heavily in the\nface with his hand. That debt I take upon myself, in addition to my\nown.”",
        "“You will pay both, Tayoga, and with interest,” said the hunter with\nconviction. “But you were right when you assumed that we could not\ngo away and leave Grosvenor a prisoner in their hands. Because we’re\nhere, and because you saw him, your Manitou has laid upon us the duty\nof saving him.”",
        "Robert’s face glowed in the dusk.",
        "“We’re bound to see it that way,” he said. “We’d be disgraced forever\nwith ourselves, if we went away and left him. Now, how are we to do\nit?”",
        "“I don’t know how yet,” replied the Onondaga, “but we must first go\ndown to the water. We’ve forgotten our thirst in the news I bring, but\nit will soon be on us again, fiercer and more burning than ever. And\nwe must have all our strength for the great task before us.”",
        "“I think it’s better for all three of us to go down to the lake at\nonce,” said Willet. “If anything happens we’ll be together, and we are\nstronger against danger, united than separated. I’ll lead the way.”",
        "It was a long and slow descent, every step taken with minute care, and\nas they approached the lake Robert found that his thirst was up and\nleaping.",
        "“I feel that I could drink the whole lake dry,” he said.",
        "“Do not do that, Dagaeoga,” said Tayoga in his precise way. “Lake\nGeorge is too beautiful to be lost.”",
        "“We might swim across it,” said Willet, looking at the silvery surface\nof the water unbroken by the dark line of any canoe. “A way has opened\nto us here, but we can’t follow it now.”",
        "Robert knelt at the margin, and took a little drink first, letting the\ncool water moisten his mouth and throat before he swallowed it. How\ngrateful it was! How wonderfully refreshing! One must almost perish\nwith thirst before he knew the enormous value of water. And when it\nwas found, one must know how to drink it right. He took a second and\nsomewhat larger drink. Then, waiting a while, he drank freely and as\nmuch as he wanted. Strength, courage, optimism flowed back into his\nveins. As they came down the cliff he had not seen any way to rescue\nGrosvenor, nor did he see it now, but he knew that they would do it.\nHis restored body and mind would not admit the possibility of failure.",
        "They remained nearly an hour in the shadow of the bushes at the\nwater’s edge, and then began the slow and painful ascent to the niche,\nwhich they reached without mishap. Another half hour there, and,\nhaving examined well their arms, they climbed to the cliff’s rim,\nwhere they looked over, and Robert obtained his first view of the\nIndian camp.",
        "The feasting was over, the fires had sunk far down, and most of the\nwarriors were asleep, but Tandakora himself sat with his arms across\nhis chest, glowering into the coals, and a line of sentinels was set.\nA red gleam from his uniform showed where Grosvenor, leaning against\na log, had fallen at last into a happy slumber, in which his desperate\ncase was forgotten for the time.",
        "“I confess that I don’t know how to do it, still it must be done,\"\nwhispered the hunter.",
        "“Yes, it must be done,” the Onondaga whispered back. “We must steal\nour friend out of the hands of his enemies. Neither do I know how to\ndo it, but perhaps Tododaho will tell me. See, there is his star!”",
        "He pointed to a great star dancing in the sky, a star with a light\nmist across its face, which he knew to be the wise snakes that lay\ncoil on coil in the hair of the Onondaga sage who had gone away\nfour hundred years ago to his place in the heavens, and prayed for a\nthought, a happy thought that would tell him the way. In a moment, his\nmind was in a state of high spiritual exaltation. An electric current\nseemed to pass from the remote star to him. He shut his eyes, and\nhis face became rapt. In a few minutes, he opened them again and said\nquietly:",
        "“I think, Great Bear, that Tododaho has told us how to proceed. You\nand Dagaeoga must draw off the warriors, and then I will take Red Coat\nfrom those that may be left behind.”",
        "“It’s mighty risky.”",
        "“Since when, Great Bear, have we been turned aside by risks! Besides,\nthere is no other way.”",
        "“It seems that I can’t think of any other.”",
        "Tayoga unfolded his plan. Robert and Willet must steal along the edge\nof the cliff and seek to pass to the north of the line of sentinels.\nIf not detected, they would purposely cause an alarm, and, as a\nconsequence, draw off the main portion of the band. Then it was their\nduty to see to it that they were not taken. Meanwhile Tayoga in the\nexcitement and confusion was to secure the release of Grosvenor, and\nthey would flee southward to the mouth of a small creek, in the lake,\nwhere Robert and Willet, after making a great turn, were to join them.",
        "“It’s complicated and it’s a desperate chance,” said Willet\nthoughtfully, “but I don’t see anything else to do. Besides, we have\ngot to act quickly. Being on the war-path, they won’t hold him long,\nand you know the kind of death Tandakora will serve out to him.”",
        "Robert shuddered. He knew too well, and knowing so well he was ready\nto risk his life to save his friend.",
        "“I think,” said Tayoga, “that we had better wait until it is about two\nhours after midnight. Then the minds and bodies of the warriors will\nbe at their dullest, and we will have the best chance.”",
        "“Right, Tayoga,” said the hunter. “We’ll have to use every trifle\nthat’s in our favor. Can you see Tandakora from here?”",
        "“He is leaning against the big tree, asleep.”",
        "“I’m glad of that. He may be a bit confused when he awakes suddenly\nand rushes off after us, full tilt, with nearly all the warriors. If\nonly two guards are left with the prisoner, Tayoga, you can dispose of\n’em.”",
        "“Fortune may favor us.”",
        "“Provided we use our wits and strength to the utmost.”",
        "“That provision must always be made, Great Bear.”",
        "Using what patience they could, they remained at the edge of the\ncliff, crouched there, until they judged it was about two o’clock\nin the morning, the night being then at its darkest. Tandakora still\nslept against his tree, and the fires were almost out. The red gleam\nfrom the uniform of Grosvenor could no longer be seen, but Robert\nhad marked well the place where he sat, and he knew that the young\nEnglishman was there, sleeping the sleep of utter exhaustion.\nEverything was still and peaceful.",
        "“After all, we could escape through their lines, now,” whispered\nRobert.",
        "“So it turns out,” said the hunter.",
        "“But it looks as if we were held back in order that we might save\nGrosvenor.”",
        "“That too may be true.”",
        "“It is time to go,” said Tayoga. “Farewell, Great Bear! Farewell,\nDagaeoga! May we meet at the mouth of the creek as we have planned,\nand may we be four who meet there and not three!”",
        "“May all the stars fight for us,” said Robert with emotion, and then\nhe and Willet moved away among the bushes, leaving Tayoga alone at\nthe cliff’s rim. Young Lennox knew that theirs was a most perilous\nventure. Had he given himself time to think about it he would have\nseen that the chances were about ten to one against its success, but\nhe resolutely closed his mind against that phase of it and insisted\nupon hope. His was the spirit that leads to success in the face of\noverwhelming odds.",
        "Willet was first, and Robert was close behind.",
        "Neither looked back, but they knew that Tayoga would not move, until\nthe alarm was given, and they could flee away with the pursuit hot\nupon their heels. Young Lennox saw again that they could now have\nslipped through the Indian lines, but the thought of deserting\nGrosvenor never entered his mind. It seemed though as if all the\nelements of nature were conspiring to facilitate the flight of the\nhunter and himself. The sentinels, whose dusky figures they were yet\nable to see, moved sleepily up and down. No dead wood that would break\nwith a snap thrust itself before their feet. The wilderness opened a\nway for them.",
        "“I think a warrior or two may be watching in the forest to the north\nof us,” whispered Willet, “but we’ll go through the line there. See\nthat fellow standing under the tree, about a hundred yards to the\nsouth. He’s the one to give the alarm.”",
        "But circumstances still favored them. Nature was peaceful. When they\nwished for the first time in their lives that their flight should\nbe detected, nothing happened, and the vigilance of the warriors who\nusually watched so well seemed to be relaxed. Robert was conscious\nthat they were passing unseen and unheard between the sentinel on the\nnorth and the sentinel on the south.",
        "Two hundred yards farther on, and the hunter brought his moccasin\nsharply down upon a dead stick which broke with a sharp snap, a sound\nthat penetrated far in the still night. Robert, glancing back, saw\nthe sentinel on the south stiffen to attention and then utter a cry of\nalarm, a shout sufficient to awaken any one of the sleeping Indians.\nIt was given back in an instant by several voices from the camp, and\nthen the hunter and the youth sprang to their task.",
        "“Now we’re to run as we’ve never run before,” exclaimed Willet. “But\nwe must let ’em think they’re going to catch us.”",
        "First, sending back a tremendous shout of defiance that he knew would\nenrage Tandakora’s men to the utmost, he raced with long swift steps\nthrough the forest, and Robert was always close on his heels. The\nyells of the Indians behind them, who pushed forward in pursuit, were\nsucceeded by silence, and Robert knew they now were running for their\nlives. Luckily, they were coming into a country with which the hunter\nhad some acquaintance, and, turning a little to the south, he led the\nway into a ravine down which they took a swift course. After a mile or\nso he stopped, and the two rested their lungs and muscles.",
        "“They can’t see our trail to-night,” said the hunter, “and they’ll\nhave to depend on eye and ear, but they’ll stick to the chase for a\nlong time. I’ve no doubt they think all three of us are here, and that\nthey may take us in one haul. Ready to start on again, Robert?”",
        "“My breath is all right now, and I’ll run a race with anybody. You\ndon’t think they’ve lost us, do you?”",
        "“Not likely, but in case they have I’ll tell ’em where we are.”",
        "He uttered a shout so piercing that it made Robert jump. Then he led\nagain at a great pace down the ravine, and a single cry behind\nthem showed that the pursuit was coming. As nearly as Robert could\ncalculate, the warriors were about three hundred yards away. He\ncould not see them, but he was sure they would hang on as long as the\nslightest chance was left to overtake Willet and himself.",
        "They fled in silence at least another mile, and then, feeling their\nbreath grow difficult again, they stopped a second time, still in the\nravine and among thick bushes.",
        "“Our flight may be a joke on them, as we intend to draw them after\nus,” said Robert, “but constant running turns it into a joke on us\ntoo. I’ve done so much of this sort of thing in the last few days that\nI feel as if I were spending my life, dodging here and there in the\nforest, trying to escape warriors.”",
        "Willet laughed dryly.",
        "“It’s not the sort of life for a growing youth,” he said, “but you’ll\nhave to live it for a while. Remember our task. If they lose our trail\nit’s our business to make ’em find it again. Here’s another challenge\nto ’em.”",
        "He shouted once more, a long, defiant war cry, much like that of the\nwarriors themselves, and then he and Robert resumed their flight,\nleaving the ravine presently, and taking a sharper course toward the\nsouth.",
        "“I think we’d have lost ’em back there if it hadn’t been for that\nwhoop of mine,” said Willet.",
        "“Perhaps it’s about time to lose them,” said Robert hopefully. “The\nsooner we do it the happier I’ll feel.”",
        "“Not yet, Robert, my lad. We must give Tayoga all the time he needs\nfor the work he’s trying to do. After all, his task is the main one,\nand the most dangerous. I think we can slow up a bit here. We have to\nsave our breath.”",
        "They dropped down to a walk, and took another deep curve toward the\nsouth, and now also to the east. Their present course, if persisted\nin, would bring them back to the lake. The night was still dark, but\ntheir trained eyes had grown so used to it that they could see very\nwell in the dusk. Both were looking back and at the same time they saw\na shadowy figure appear in the forest behind them. Robert knew that it\nwas the vanguard of the pursuit which was drawing uncomfortably close,\nat least for him. A shout from the warriors was followed by a shot,\nand a bullet cut its way through the leaves near them.",
        "“I think we ought to give ’em a hint that they come too close, at\ntheir peril,” said Willet, and raising his own rifle he sent back an\nanswering shot which did not go astray. The first warrior fell, and\nothers who had come forward in the undergrowth gave back for the time.",
        "“They’ll take the hint,” said the hunter, “and now we’ll increase our\nspeed.”",
        "He reloaded, as they ran, and a little later Robert sent a bullet that\nstruck the mark. Once more the warriors shrank back for the time,\nand the hunter and lad, using their utmost speed, fled toward the\nsouthwest at such a great rate that the pursuit, at length, was left\nbehind and finally was lost. Day found their foes out of sight, and\ntwo or three hours later they came to the mouth of the creek, where\nthey were to meet Tayoga, in case he succeeded.",
        "“And now the rest is in other hands than ours,” said Willet.",
        "Forcing themselves to assume a patience they could scarcely feel, they\nsat down to wait.",
        "They still had food left in their knapsacks, and they ate a portion,\ndrinking afterward from the creek. Then they resumed their places\nin the dense undergrowth, where they could watch well and yet remain\nhidden. They could also see from where they lay the shimmering waters\nof Andiatarocte, and the lake seemed to be once more at peace. They\nfelt satisfaction that they had completed their part of the great\nenterprise, but their anxiety nevertheless was intense. As Willet had\ntruly said, Tayoga’s share was the more dangerous and delicate by far.",
        "“Do you think he will come?” Robert asked after a long silence.",
        "“If any human being could come under such circumstances and bring\nGrosvenor with him, it is Tayoga,” replied the hunter. “I think\nsometimes that the Onondaga is superhuman in the forest.”",
        "“Then he will come,” said Robert hopefully.",
        "“Best not place our hopes too high. The hours alone will tell. It’s\nhard work waiting, but that’s our task.”",
        "The morning drew on. Another beautiful day had dawned, but Robert\nscarcely noticed its character. He was thinking with all his soul of\nTayoga and Grosvenor. Would they come? Willet was able to read his\nmind. He was intensely anxious himself, but he knew that the strain\nof waiting upon Robert, with his youthful and imaginative mind, was\ngreater. He was bound to be suffering cruelly.",
        "“We must give them time,” he said. “Remember that Grosvenor is not\nused to the woods, and can’t go through them as fast as we can. We\nmust have confidence too. We both know what a wonder Tayoga is.”",
        "Robert sprang suddenly to his feet.",
        "“What was that!” he exclaimed.",
        "A sound had come out of the north, just a breath, but it was not the\nwind among the leaves, nor yet the distant song of a bird. It was the\nfaint howl of a wolf, and yet Robert believed that it was not a wolf\nthat made it.",
        "“Did you hear it?” he repeated.",
        "“Aye, lad, I heard it,” replied the hunter. “’Tis a signal, and ’tis\nTayoga too who comes. But whether he comes alone, or with a friend, I\nknow not. To tell that we must bide here and see.”",
        "“Should not we send our answer?”",
        "“Nay, lad. He knows where we are. This is the appointed place, and the\nfewer signals we give the less likely the enemy is to get a hint we’re\nhere. I don’t think we will hear from Tayoga again until he shows in\nperson.”",
        "Robert said no more, knowing full well the truth of the hunter’s\nwords, but his heart was beating hard, and he stirred nervously. He\nhad been drawn strongly to Grosvenor, and he knew what a horrible fate\nawaited him at the hands of Tandakora, unless the Onondaga saved\nhim. Nor would there be another chance for interruption by Tayoga or\nanybody else. But the minutes passed and he took courage. Tayoga\nhad not yet come. If alone he would have arrived by this time. His\nslowness must be due to the fact that he had Grosvenor with him. More\nminutes passed and he heard steps in the undergrowth. Now he was sure.\nTayoga was not alone. His moccasins never left any sound. He stood\nup expectant, and two figures appeared among the bushes. They were\nTayoga, calm, his breath unhurried, a faint smile in his dark eyes,\nand Grosvenor, exhausted, reeling, his clothing worse torn than ever,\nbut the light of hope on his face. Robert uttered a cry of joy and\ngrasped the young Englishman’s hand.",
        "“Thank God, you are here!” he exclaimed.",
        "“I thank God and I thank this wonderful young Indian too,” panted\nGrosvenor. “It was a miracle! I had given up hope when he dropped from\nthe skies and saved me!”",
        "“Sit down and get your breath, man,” said Willet. “Then you can tell\nus about it.”",
        "Grosvenor sank upon the ground, and did not speak again until the\npain in his laboring chest was gone. Tayoga leaned against a tree, and\nRobert noticed then that he carried an extra rifle and ammunition. The\nOnondaga thought of everything. Willet filled his cap with water at\nthe creek, and brought it to Grosvenor, who drank long and deeply.",
        "“Tastes good!” said the hunter, smiling.",
        "“Like nectar,” said the Englishman, “but it’s nectar to me too to see\nboth of you, Mr. Willet and Mr. Lennox. I don’t understand yet how it\nhappened. It’s really and truly a miracle.”",
        "“A miracle mostly of Tayoga’s working,” said the hunter.",
        "“I thought the end of everything for me had come,” said Grosvenor,\n\"and I was only praying that it might not be harder for me than I\ncould stand, when the alarm was heard in the forest, and nearly all\nthe Indians ran off in pursuit of something or other. Only two were\nleft with me. There was a shot from the woods, one of them fell, this\nwonderful friend of yours appeared from the forest, wounded the other,\nwho took to his heels, then we started running in the other direction,\nand here we are. It’s a marvel and I don’t yet see how it was done.”",
        "“Tayoga’s marvelous knowledge of the woods, his skill and his\nquickness made the greater part of the miracle,” said the hunter, “and\nyou see too, Lieutenant Grosvenor, that he even had the forethought\nto bring away with him the rifle and ammunition of the fallen warrior,\nthat you might have arms now that you are strong enough to bear them\nagain.”",
        "Tayoga without a word handed him the rifle and ammunition, and\nGrosvenor felt strength flowing back into his body when he took them.",
        "“Could you eat a bite?” asked Willet.",
        "“I think I could now,” replied the Englishman, “although I’ll confess\nI’ve had no appetite up to the present. My situation didn’t permit\nhunger.”",
        "Willet handed him a piece of venison and he ate. Meanwhile Tayoga, who\nseemed to feel no weariness, and the others were watching. In a short\ntime the hunter announced that it was time to go.",
        "“We can’t afford to delay here any longer and have ’em overtake us!\"\nhe said. “We’re out of the ring now, and it’s our affair to keep out.\nLieutenant Grosvenor, you can tell us as we go along how you happened\nto be the prisoner of Tandakora.”",
        "“It needs only a few words,” said the Englishman as they took their\nway southward through the woods. “I was at Albany with a body of\ntroops, a vanguard for the force that we mean to march against the\nFrench at Ticonderoga. I was sent northward with ten men to scour\nthe country, and in the woods we were set upon suddenly by savage\nwarriors. My troopers were either killed or scattered, and I was\ntaken. That was yesterday morning. Since then I have been hurried\nthrough the forest, I know not where, and I have had a most appalling\nexperience. As I have said before, I’d long since given up hope for a\nmiracle like the one that has saved me. What a horrible creature that\ngiant Indian was!”",
        "“Tandakora is all that you think him and more. He’s been hunting us\ntoo, and when he comes back to his camp he’ll be after us all four\nagain. So, that’s why we hurry.”",
        "“You’re in no bigger hurry than I am,” said Grosvenor with attempt at\na smile. “If I could find the seven-league boots I’d put them on.”",
        "Tayoga once more led the way, and he examined the forest on all sides\nwith eyes that saw everything.",
        "Robert and Willet were greatly refreshed by their rest at the creek,\nand the promise of life that had been made again so wonderfully put\nnew strength in Grosvenor’s frame. So they were able to travel at a\ngood pace, though the three listened continually for any sound that\nmight indicate pursuit.",
        "Yet as the morning progressed there was no hostile sign and their\nconfidence rose.",
        "Robert hoped most devoutly that they would soon come within the region\nof friends. While the French and Indians held the whole length of Lake\nChamplain and it was believed Montcalm would fortify somewhere\nnear Ticonderoga, yet Lake George was debatable. It was generally\nconsidered within the British and American sphere, although they were\nhaving ample proof that fierce bands of the enemy roved about it at\nwill.",
        "Aside from the danger there was another reason why he wished so\nearnestly for escape from this tenacious pursuit. They were seeing\nthe bottoms of their knapsacks. One could not live on air and mountain\nlakes alone, however splendid they might be, and, although the\nwilderness usually furnished food to three such capable hunters,\nthey could not seek game while Tandakora and his savage warriors were\nseeking them. So, their problem was, in a sense, economic, and could\nnot be fought with weapons only.",
        "At a signal from Willet, who observed that Grosvenor was somewhat\ntired, they sank their pace to a slow walk, and in about three hours\nstopped entirely, sitting down on fallen timber which had been heaped\nin a windrow by a passing hurricane. They were still in dense forest\nand had borne away somewhat from Andiatarocte, but, through the\nfoliage, they caught glimpses of the lake rippling peacefully in\nsilver and blue and purple.",
        "“Once more I want to thank you fellows for saving me,” said Grosvenor.",
        "“Don’t mention it again,” said the hunter. “In the wilderness we have\nto save one another now and then, or none of us would live. Your turn\nto rescue us may come before you think.”",
        "“I know nothing of the forest. I feel helpless here.”",
        "“Just the same, you don’t know what weapon Tayoga’s Manitou may place\nin your hands. The border brings strange and unexpected chances. But\nour present crisis is not over. We’re not saved yet, and we can’t\nafford to relax our efforts a particle. What is it, Tayoga?”",
        "The Onondaga, rising from the fallen tree, had gone about twenty yards\ninto the forest, where he was examining the ground, obviously with\ngreat concentration of both eye and mind. He waited at least a minute\nbefore replying. Then he said:",
        "“Our friend, the lone ranger, Black Rifle, has passed here.”",
        "“How can you know that?” asked Grosvenor in surprise.",
        "“Come and look at his traces,” said Tayoga. “See where he has written\nhis name in the earth; that is, he has left what you would call in\nEurope his visiting card.”",
        "Grosvenor looked attentively at the ground, but he saw only a very\nfaint impression, and he never would have noticed that had not the\nOnondaga pointed it out to him.",
        "“It might have been left by a deer,” he objected.",
        "“Impossible,” said Tayoga. “The entire imprint is not made, but there\nis enough to indicate very clearly that a human foot and nothing\nelse pressed there. Here is another trace, although lighter, and here\nanother and another. The trail leads southward.”",
        "“But granting it to be that of a man,” Grosvenor again objected, “it\nmight be that of any one of the thousands who roam the wilderness.”",
        "The great red trailer who had inherited the forest lore of countless\ngenerations smiled.",
        "“It is not any one of the thousands and it could not be,” he said. “It\nis easy to tell that. The footsteps are those of a white man, because\nthey turn out, and not in, as do ours of the red race. That is very\neasy; even Dagaeoga here, the great talker, knows it. The footsteps\nare far apart, so we are sure that they are those of a tall man; the\nimprints are deep, proving them to have been made by a heavy man, and\nat the outer edge of the heel the impression is deeper than on the\ninner edge. I noticed, when we last saw Black Rifle, which was not\nlong ago, that he wore moccasins of moose hide, that he had turned\nthem outward a little, through wear, and that a small strip of the\nhardest moose hide had been sewed on the right edge of each heel in\norder to keep them level. Those strips have made their marks here.”",
        "“Somebody else might have put strips of hide on his moccasin heels!”",
        "“It is so, but Black Rifle is tall and large and heavy, and we know\nthat the man who made this trail is tall, large and heavy. The chances\nare a hundred to one against the fact that any other man tall, large\nand heavy with moose hide strips to even the wear of his moccasin\nheels has passed here, especially as this is within the range of Black\nRifle. I know that it is he as truly as I know that I am standing\nhere.”",
        "“Of course,” said Robert, who had never felt the slightest doubt of\nTayoga’s knowledge. “What was Black Rifle doing?”",
        "“He was looking for St. Luc or Tandakora, because his trail does not\nlead straight on. See! here it comes, and here again. If Black Rifle\nhad been on a journey he would have gone straight, but he is seeking\nsomething and so he turns about. Ah, he wishes to see if there are\nany canoes visible on the lake, for lo! the trail now leads toward\nthe water! Here he found that none was to be seen and here he rested.\nBlack Rifle had been long on his feet, two days and two nights\nperhaps, because it takes much to make him weary. He sat on this log.\nHe left a strand from the fringe of his buckskin hunting shirt, caught\non a splinter. Do you not see it, Lieutenant Grosvenor?”",
        "“Now that you hold it up before my eyes I notice it But I should never\nhave found it in the wilderness.” “Minute observation is what every\ntrailer has to learn,” said Willet, “else you are no trailer at all,\nand you’ll learn, Lieutenant, while you are with us, that Tayoga is\nprobably the greatest trailer the world has ever produced.”",
        "“Peace, Great Bear! Peace!” protested the Onondaga.",
        "“It’s so, just the same. Now, what did Black Rifle do after he rested\nhimself on the log?”",
        "“He went back farther into the woods, turning away from the lake,\"\nreplied Tayoga, “and he sat down again on another fallen log. Black\nRifle was hungry, and he ate. Here is the small bone of a deer,\npicked quite clean, lying on the ground by the log. Black Rifle was a\nfortunate man. He had bread, too. See, here is a crumb in this crack\nin the log too deep down for any bird to reach with his bill. Black\nRifle sat here quite a long time. He was thinking hard. He did not\nneed so much time for resting. He remained sitting on the log while he\nwas trying to decide what he would do. It is likely that Black Rifle\nthought a great force was behind him, and he turned back to see. Had\nhe kept straight on toward the south, as he was going at first, he\nwould not have needed so much time for thinking over his plans. Ah, he\nhas turned! Lo! his trail goes almost directly back on his own course.\nIt will lead to the top of the hillock there, because he wants to see\nfar, and I think that after seeing he will turn again, and follow his\noriginal course.”",
        "“Why do you think that?” asked Grosvenor.",
        "“Because, O Red Coat, it is likely that Black Rifle knew from the\nfirst which way he wanted to go and went that way. He has merely\nturned back, like a wise general, to scout a little, and see that no\ndanger comes from the rear. Yes, he stood here on the hillock from\nwhich we can get a good view over the country, and walked to every\nside of the crest to find where the best view could be obtained. That,\nRed Coat, is the simplest of all things. Behold the traces of his\nmoccasins as he walked from side to side. Nothing else could have made\nBlack Rifle move about so much in the space of a few square yards. Now\nhe leaves the hillock and goes down its side toward a low valley in\nwhich runs a brook. Black Rifle is thirsty and will drink deep.”",
        "“That you can’t possibly know, Tayoga.”",
        "“But I do know it, Red Coat.”",
        "“You don’t even know a brook is near.”",
        "“I know it, because I have seen it. My eyes are trained to the forest,\nand I caught the gleam of running water through the leaves to the\nwest. Running water, of course, means a brook. Black Rifle’s trail now\nleads toward it, and I assume that he was thirsty because he had just\neaten well. We are nearly always thirsty after eating. But we shall\nsee whether I am right. Here is the brook, and there are the faint\ntraces made by Black Rifle’s knees, when he knelt to reach the water.\nHe started away, but found that he was still thirsty, so he came back\nand drank again. Here are his footprints about a yard from the others.\nThis time, he will go back toward the south, and I think it is sure\nthat he is looking for St. Luc, who must have gone in that direction\nwith a strong force, Tandakora having stayed behind to take us. It is\nlikely that Black Rifle went on, because a great British and American\narmy is gathering below, which fact he knows well, and it is probable\nthat Black Rifle follows St. Luc, because he will hunt the biggest\ngame.”",
        "Grosvenor’s eyes sparkled.",
        "“I understand,” he said. “It is a great art, that of trailing through\nthe wilderness, and I can see how circumstances compel you to learn\nit.”",
        "“We have to learn it to live,” said the hunter gravely, “but with\nTayoga it is an art carried to the highest degree of perfection. He\nwas born with a gift for it, a very great gift. He inherited all the\nlearning accumulated by a thousand years of ancestors, and then he\nadded to it by his own supreme efforts.”",
        "“Do not believe all that Great Bear tells you,” said Tayoga modestly.\n\"For unknown reasons he is partial to me, and enlarges my small\nmerits.”",
        "“I think this would be a good place for all of you to wait, while\nI went back on the trail a piece,” said the hunter. “If Black Rifle\nfound it necessary to cover the rear, it’s a much more urgent duty for\nus who know that we’ve been followed by Tandakora to do the same.”",
        "“The Great Bear is always wise,” said Tayoga. “We will take our ease\nwhile we await him.”",
        "He flung himself down on the turf and relaxed his figure completely.\nHe had learned long since to make the most of every passing minute,\nand, seeing Robert imitate him exactly, Grosvenor did likewise. The\nhunter had disappeared already in the bushes and the three lay in\nsilence.",
        "Grosvenor felt an immense peace. Brave as a young lion, he had been\noverwhelmed nevertheless by his appalling experiences, and his sudden\nrescue where rescue seemed impossible had taken him back to the\nheights. Now, it seemed to him that the three, and especially the\nOnondaga, could do everything. Tayoga’s skill as a trailer and scout\nwas so marvelous that no enemy could come anywhere near without\nhis knowledge. The young Englishman felt that he was defended by\nimpassable walls, and he was so free from apprehension that his nerves\nbecame absolutely quiet. Then worn nature took its toll, and his\neyelids drooped. Before he was aware that he was sleepy he was asleep.",
        "“You might do as Red Coat has done, Dagaeoga,” said Tayoga. “I can\nwatch for us all, and it is wise in the forest to take sleep when we\ncan.”",
        "“I’ll try,” said Robert, and he tried so successfully that in a few\nminutes he too slumbered, with his figure outstretched, and his head\non his arm. Tayoga made a circle about three hundred yards in diameter\nabout them, but finding no hostile sign came back and lay on the turf\nnear them. He relaxed his figure again and closed his eyes, which may\nhave seemed strange but which was not so in the case of Tayoga. His\nhearing was extraordinarily acute, and, when his eyes were shut, it\ngrew much stronger than ever. Now he knew that no warrior could come\nwithin rifle shot of them without his ears telling him of the savage\napproach. Every creeping footstep would be registered upon that\ndelicate drum.",
        "With eyes shut and brain rested, Tayoga nevertheless knew all that was\ngoing on near him. That eardrum of infinite delicacy told him that a\nwoodpecker was tapping on a tree, well toward the north; that a little\ngray bird almost as far to the south was singing with great vigor and\nsweetness; that a rabbit was hopping about in the undergrowth,\ncurious and yet fearful; that an eagle with a faint whirr of wings\nhad alighted on a bough, and was looking at the three; that the eagle\nthinking they might be dangerous had unfolded his wings again and was\nflying away; that a deer passing to the west had caught a whiff\nof them on the wind and was running with all speed in the other\ndirection; that a lynx had climbed a tree, and, after staring at them,\nhad climbed down again, and had fled, his coward heart filled with\nterror.",
        "Thus Tayoga, with his ears, watched his world. He too, his eyelids\nlowered, felt a peace that was soothing and almost dreamy, but, though\nhis body relaxed, those wonderfully sensitive drums of his ears caught\nand registered everything. The record showed that for nearly two hours\nthe life of the wilderness went on as usual, the ordinary work and\nplay of animal and bird, and then the drums told him that man was\ncoming. A footstep was registered very clearly, and then another and\nanother, but Tayoga did not open his eyes. He knew who was coming as\nwell as if he had seen him. The drums of his ears made signals that\nhis mind recognized at once. He had long known the faint sound of\nthose footsteps. Willet was coming back.",
        "Tayoga, through the faculty of hearing, was aware of much more than\nthe mere fact that the hunter was returning. He knew that Willet had\nfound nothing, that the pursuit was still far away and that they were\nin no immediate danger. He knew it by his easy, regular walk, free\nfrom either haste or lagging delay. He knew it by the straight, direct\nline he took for the three young men, devoid of any stops or turnings\naside to watch and listen. Willet’s course was without care.",
        "Tayoga opened his eyes, and lazily regarded the giant figure of his\nfriend now in full view. Robert and Grosvenor slept on. “I am glad,\"\nsaid the Onondaga.",
        "It was significant of the way in which they understood each other and\nthe way they could read the signs of the forest that they could talk\nalmost without words.",
        "“So am I,” said the hunter, “but I had hoped for it.”",
        "“Since it is so, we need not awaken them just yet.”",
        "“No, let them sleep another hour.”",
        "Tayoga meant that he was glad the enemy had not approached and Willet\nreplied that he had hoped for such good luck. No further explanation\nwas needed.",
        "“You had the heaviest part of the burden to carry, last night,” said\nthe hunter, “so it would be wise for you to join them if you can, in\nthe hour that’s left. See if you can’t follow them, at once.”",
        "“I think I can,” said Tayoga. “At least I will try.”",
        "In five minutes he too had gone to the land of dreams and the hunter\nwatched alone. Willet, although weary, was in high spirits. They had\ncome marvelously through many perils, and Tayoga’s achievement in\nrescuing Grosvenor, he repeated to himself, was well nigh miraculous.\nAfter such startling luck they could not fail, and an omen of\ncontinued good fortune was the fact they had encountered the trail of\nBlack Rifle. He would be a powerful addition to their little force,\nwhen found, and Willet did not doubt that they would overtake him. The\nonly problem that really worried him now was that of food. Small\nas was their army of four, it had to be provisioned, and, for the\npresent, he did not see the way to do it.",
        "He let the three sleep overtime, and when they awoke they were\ngrateful to him for it.",
        "“I am quite made over,” said Grosvenor, “and I think that if I stay in\nthe wilderness long enough I may learn to be a scout too. But as all\nmy life has been spent in quite different kinds of country, I suppose\nit will take a hundred years to give me a good start.”",
        "Tayoga smiled.",
        "“Not a hundred years,” he said. “Red Coat has begun very well.”",
        "“And now with a lot of good solid food I’ll feel equal to any march,\"\ncontinued Grosvenor. “Most Englishmen, you know, eat well.”",
        "Tayoga looked at Robert, who looked at Willet, who in his turn looked\nat the Onondaga.",
        "“That’s just what we’ll have to do without,” said the hunter gravely.\n\"The bottoms of our knapsacks are looking up at us. We’ll have a\nsplendid chance to see how long we can do without food. One needs such\na test now and then.”",
        "Grosvenor’s face fell, but his was the true mettle. In an instant his\ncountenance became cheerful again.",
        "“I’m not hungry!” he exclaimed. “It was the delusion of a moment, and\nit passed as quickly as it came. I suffer from such brief spells.”",
        "The others laughed.",
        "“That’s the right spirit,” said Willet, “and while we have nothing to\neat we have lots of hope. I’ve been hungrier than this often, and,\nas you see, I’ve never starved to death a single time. There’s always\nlots of food somewhere in the wilderness, if you only know how to put\nyour hand on it.”",
        "“I think it is now best for us to follow on the trail of Black Rifle,\"\nsaid Tayoga.",
        "“That’s so,” responded the hunter. “It’s grown a lot colder, while\nyou lads slept, though I think you can follow it without any trouble,\nTayoga.”",
        "The red lad said nothing, but at once picked up the traces, which now\nled south, slanting back a little toward the lake.",
        "“Black Rifle was going fast,” he said. “His stride lengthens. He must\nhave divined where St. Luc with his force lay, and he took a direct\ncourse for it. Ah, he turns suddenly aside and walks to and fro.”",
        "“That’s curious,” said the hunter. “I see the footprints all about.\nWhat did Black Rifle mean by moving about in such a manner?”",
        "“It is not odd at all,” said Tayoga. “Doubtless Black Rifle was\nsuffering from the same lack that we are, and it was necessary for him\nto provision his army of one at once. He suddenly saw a chance to do\nso and he turned aside from his direct journey toward the south. So we\nshall soon see where Black Rifle shot his bear.”",
        "“And why not a deer?” said Grosvenor.",
        "“Because his trail now leads toward that deep thicket on our right, a\nthicket made up of bushes and vines and briars. A deer could not have\ngone into it, but a bear could, and we know now it was a bear, because\nhere are its tracks. Black Rifle killed the bear in the thicket.”",
        "“Are you sure of that, Tayoga?” asked Robert.",
        "“Absolutely sure, Dagaeoga. It is in this case a matter of mind and\nnot of eye. Black Rifle is too good a hunter to fire a useless shot,\nand too experienced to miss his game, when he needs it so badly. He\nwould take every precaution for success. My mind tells me that it was\nimpossible for him to miss.”",
        "“And he didn’t miss,” said Robert, as they entered the thicket. “See\nwhere the vines and briars were threshed about by the bear as he fell.\nHere are spots of blood, and here goes the path along which he dragged\nthe body. All this is as plain as day.”",
        "“It was a fat bear too,” said Tayoga. “Although it is early spring he\nhad found so many good roots and berries that he had more than made\nup for the loss of weight in his long winter fast. We will soon find\nwhere Black Rifle cleaned his prize. A bear is too heavy to carry far.\nAh, he did his work just beyond us in the little valley!”",
        "“How do you know that?” asked Grosvenor. “We can’t yet see into the\nvalley.”",
        "The great red trailer smiled.",
        "“This time, O Red Coat,” he replied, “it is a combination of mind and\neye. Mind tells me that Black Rifle could not clean and dress his bear\nunless he got it to water. Mind tells me that a brook is flowing in\nthe valley just ahead of us, because there is scarcely a valley in the\ncountry that does not have its brook. Eye tells me that Black Rifle\nfinished his task by the great oak there. Do you not see the huge\nbuzzards flying above the tree? They are conclusive. Ah, the forest\npeople gathered fast in numbers! They expected that Black Rifle would\nleave them a great feast.”",
        "They found a little brook of clear, cold water and, beside it, the\nplace where Black Rifle had cleaned his bear, reserving afterward the\nchoice portion for himself.",
        "“When he went on,” said Tayoga, “the forest people made a rush for\nwhat he did not want, which was much. Great birds came. We cannot see\ntheir trail through the air, but we can see where they hopped about\nhere on the ground, tore at the flesh, and fought with one another for\nthe spoil. A lynx came, and then another, and then wolves. The weasel\nand the mink too hung on the outskirts, waiting for what the bigger\nanimals might leave. Among them they left nothing and they were not\nlong in the task.”",
        "Only shining bones lay on the ground. They had been picked clean and\nall the forest people had gone after their brief banquet. The trails\nled away in different directions, but that of Black Rifle went on\ntoward the south. The traces, however, were more distinct than they\nhad been before he stopped for the bear.",
        "“It is because he is carrying much weight,” said Tayoga. “Black Rifle\nno longer skips along like a youth, as Red Coat here does.”",
        "“You can have all the sport with me you wish,” said Grosvenor. “I\ndon’t forget that you saved my life, when by all the rules of logic it\nwas lost beyond the hope of recovery.”",
        "“Black Rifle would not eat so much bear meat himself,” said Tayoga,\n\"nor would he carry such a burden, without good cause. It may be that\nhe expects us. He has perhaps heard that we are in this region.”",
        "“It’s possible,” said the hunter.",
        "Full of eagerness, they pressed forward on the trail.",
        "They had been following the trail about half an hour, when Tayoga\nnoticed that it was growing deeper.",
        "“Ah,” he said, “Black Rifle now walks much more slowly, so slow that\nhe barely creeps, and his feet press down harder. I think he is going\nto make another stop.”",
        "“Maybe he intends to cook a part of that fat bear,” said Grosvenor,\nstruggling hard, though, to keep all trace of envy out of his voice.\n\"You said a while back that he was going to kill the bear, because he\nwas hungry, and it seems to me that he would be a very foolish man, if\nhaving got his bear, he didn’t make use of any portion of it.”",
        "Tayoga laughed with sincere enjoyment.",
        "“Red Coat reasons well,” he said. “If a man is eager to eat, and he\nhas that which he can eat, then he would be a silly man if he did not\neat. Red Coat has all the makings of a trailer. In a few more yards,\nBlack Rifle will stop and cook himself a splendid dinner. Here he put\nhis bear meat upon this log. The red stains show it. Then he picked up\ndead and fallen wood, and broke it into the right length over the log.\nYou can see where he broke places in the bark at the same time. Then\nhe heaped them all in the little hollow, where he has left the pile\nof ashes. But, before he lighted a fire, with his flint and steel,\nhe made a wide circle all about to see if any enemy might be near. We\nknew he would do that because Black Rifle is a very cautious man, but\nhis trail proves it to any one who wishes to look. Then, satisfied, he\ncame back, and started the flame. But he kept the blaze very low lest\na prowling foe see it. When the bed of coals was fanned he cooked\nlarge portions of the bear and ate, because Black Rifle was hungry,\nah, so hungry! and the bear was very savory and pleasing to his\npalate!”",
        "“Stop, Tayoga, stop!” exclaimed Grosvenor, “I can’t stand such\ntorture! You’ll make me starve to death where I stand.”",
        "“But as you are about to become a warrior of the woods, Red Coat,\"\nsaid the Onondaga gravely, “you must learn to endure. Among us a\nwarrior will purposely put the fire to his hand or his breast and hold\nit there until the flesh smokes. Nor will he utter a groan or even\nwince. And all his people will applaud him and call him brave.”",
        "Grosvenor shuddered. He did not see the lurking gleam of humor in the\neye of Tayoga.",
        "“I don’t need to pretend for the sake of practice that I am starving,\"\nhe said. “I’m starving in fact and I do it without the need of\napplause.”",
        "“But Black Rifle was enjoying himself greatly,” continued the\nOnondaga, “and we can rejoice in the joys of a friend. If we have not\na thing ourselves it is pleasant to know that somebody else had it.\nHe used his opportunities to the utmost. Here are more bones which\nhe threw away, with shreds of flesh yet on them, and which the forest\npeople came to pick clean. Lo, their tracks are everywhere about Black\nRifle’s little camp. One of them became so persistent and bold–a wolf\nit was–that Black Rifle, not willing to shoot, seized a large stone,\nand threw it at him with great violence. There lies the stone at the\nedge of the wood, and as there is fresh earth on its under surface it\nwas partly imbedded in the ground where Black Rifle snatched it up.\nThere, just beyond your right foot, Red Coat, is a little depression,\nthe place in the earth, from which he tore it. Black Rifle’s aim was\ngood too. He struck the wolf. At the foot of the bank there are\nred stains where several drops of blood fell. The wolf was full of\nmortification, pain and anger, when he ran away. He would never have\nbeen so bold and venturesome, if his hunger had not made him forget\nhis prudence. He was as hungry as you are this minute, Red Coat.”",
        "“I suppose you are giving me preliminary practice in torture, Tayoga.\nWell, go on with it, old fellow. I’ll try to stand it.”",
        "“No, that is enough as a beginning. We will follow the trail of Black\nRifle again. After he had eaten so well he was so much refreshed that\nhe will start again with a vigorous and strong step. Lo, it is as I\nsaid! He is taking a long stride, but I do not think he is walking\nfast. His pace is very slow. It may be that there is something in what\nDagaeoga says. It is possible that Black Rifle is waiting for those\nwho will not be unwelcome to him.”",
        "Robert was quite able to fathom what was passing in the brain of\nthe Onondaga. He saw that the trail was growing quite fresh, and his\nspirits became buoyant.",
        "“And Red Coat is hungry,” said Tayoga, that lurking gleam of humor in\nhis eye growing larger. “Let him remember that however he may suffer\nfrom lack of food he can suffer yet more. It is wonderful what the\nbody can endure and yet live. Here Black Rifle stopped and rested on\nthese stones, perhaps an hour. No, Red Coat, there are no signs to\nshow it, but the trail on the other side is much fresher, which proves\nit. It is quite clear now that Black Rifle is waiting. He is not\nrunning away from anybody or anything. Ah! Red Coat, if we only had\nsome of his precious bear steaks how welcome to us they would be!”",
        "“Go on, Tayoga. As I told you, I’d try to stand it.”",
        "“That is well, Red Coat. But it is not enough merely to wish for Black\nRifle’s bear steaks. We will have a portion of them ourselves.”",
        "“Now, Tayoga, your talk sounds a little wild to me.”",
        "“But listen, Red Coat.”",
        "The Onondaga suddenly put his fingers to his lips, and blew a shrill\nwhistle that penetrated far in the forest. In a few instants, the\nanswer, another whistle, came back from a point a few hundred yards\nahead, and Tayoga said quietly:",
        "“Red Coat, Black Rifle is waiting for us. We will now go forward and\nhe will give us our dinner.”",
        "They advanced without hesitation and the figure of the dark hunter\nrose up to meet them. His face showed pleasure, as he extended his\nhand first to Willet.",
        "“Dave, old comrade,” he said, “the sight of you in the forest is\nalways a pleasure to the eye. I thought you’d be coming with the lads,\nand I’ve been making ready for you. I knew that Tayoga, the greatest\ntrailer the world has ever known, would be sure to strike my traces,\nand that he’d read them like print. And here’s Robert too, a fine boy,\nif I do say it to his face, and Lieutenant Grosvenor. You mayn’t know\nme, Lieutenant, though I recall you, and I can tell you you’re mighty\nlucky to fall into the hands of these three.”",
        "“I think so too,” said Grosvenor earnestly.",
        "“Red Coat is happy to see you,” said Tayoga, “but he will be happier\nto see your bear.”",
        "“The Lieutenant is hungry,” said Black Rifle. “Then come; there is\nenough for all.”",
        "“What made you wait for us?” asked Robert.",
        "“You know how I roam the woods, doing as I please and under nobody’s\ncommand. I found that Tandakora was by the lake with warriors and\nthat St. Luc was not far away. Tandakora’s men seemed to be trailing\nsomebody, and hiding in the bushes, I spied on them. I was near enough\nto hear two warriors talking and I learned that it was you they were\nfollowing. Then, coming on ahead, I left a trail for you to see. And\nI’ve got plenty of bear steaks already cooked for you.”",
        "“God bless you, Mr. Black Rifle,” said Grosvenor fervently.",
        "“Amen!” said Robert.",
        "Black Rifle showed them his lair among dense bushes, and, after they\nhad satisfied their hunger, the bear, divided in equal portions among\nall, was stored away in their knapsacks, Grosvenor luckily having\nretained his own as the Indians had not deprived him of it. They now\nhad food enough for several days, and one great source of anxiety was\nremoved.",
        "“What had you found, Black Rifle?” asked Willet.",
        "“St. Luc has a big force. He’s throwing a sort of veil before\nMontcalm, while the Marquis fortifies to meet the attack of the\nBritish and Americans that all know is coming. Perhaps the Lieutenant\ncan tell us most about that force!”",
        "“It’s to be a great one,” said Grosvenor.",
        "“And we’ll go through to Quebec!” said Robert, his eyes flashing,\nhis imagination at once alive. “We’ll put out forever the fire that’s\nalways burning in the north and give our border peace.”",
        "“Easy, lads, easy!” said Willet. “A thing’s never done until it’s\ndone. I feel pretty sure we’ll do it, but we’ll reckon with present\ndifficulties first. It seems to me it’s our duty now to follow St.\nLuc, and see what he means to do with his force. It’s hard on you,\nLieutenant, because you’ll have to stay with us. You can’t go back to\nAlbany just yet.”",
        "Grosvenor glanced around at the unbroken forest. “I’m resigned,” he\nsaid. “After that wonderful escape I’m ready for anything. I see that\nthis is my great chance to become a scout, and I’ll do the best I\ncan.”",
        "“I take it,” said Black Rifle, “that the main object of St. Luc is to\nclear the forest of all our scouts and skirmishers in order that we\nmay be kept in complete ignorance of Montcalm’s movements. We’ll show\nhim that he can’t do it. You have not forgotten any of your skill,\nhave you, Tayoga?”",
        "“So far from forgetting any of it he’s acquired more,” said Willet,\nanswering for the Onondaga. “When it comes to trailing that boy just\nbreathes it in. He adds some new tricks every day. But I think we’d\nbetter lie by, the rest of to-day, and to-night, don’t you, Black\nRifle? We don’t want to wear out our lads at the start.”",
        "“Well spoken, Dave,” responded Black Rifle. “It’s a camp in the\nenemy’s country we’ll have to make with the warriors all about us, but\nwe must take the risk. We’d better go to the next brook and walk up it\na long distance. It’s the oldest of all tricks to hide your trail, but\nit is still the best.”",
        "They found the brook only a few hundred yards farther on, and\nextended their walk along its pebbly bed fully a mile and a half as a\nprecaution, keeping to their wading until they could emerge on rocky\nground, where they left no trail.",
        "“It will be only chance now that will bring them down on us,” said\nWillet. “Do you think, Lieutenant, that after such a long walk you\ncould manage another bear steak?”",
        "“If the company will join me!” replied Grosvenor. “I don’t wish to\nshow bad manners.”",
        "“I’ll join you,” said Willet, speaking for the others, “and I think\nwe’ll make a brief camp on that wooded hill there.”",
        "“Why on a hill, Mr. Willet? Why not in a hollow where it seems to me\nwe would be better hidden?”",
        "“Because, besides hiding ourselves, we want to see, and you can see\nbetter from a height than from a valley. In the bushes there we’ll\nhave a view all about us, and I don’t think our enemies can come\ntoo near, unseen by us. When we get into the thicket on the hill,\nLieutenant, you can resume that pleasant nap that you did not finish.\nEight or ten hours more of sleep will be just the thing for you.”",
        "“All of you sleep a while,” said Black Rifle. “I’ll guard. I’m fresh.\nBut be sure you walk on the stones. We must leave no trace.”",
        "They found a fairly comfortable place in the thicket and soon all were\nasleep except Black Rifle, who sat with his rifle between his knees,\nand from his covert scanned the forest on all sides.",
        "Black Rifle felt satisfaction. He was pleased to be with the friends\nfor whom he cared most. An historical figure, solitary, aloof, he was\na vivid personality, yet scarcely anything was known about him. His\nright name even had disappeared, and, to the border, far and near he\nwas just Black Rifle, or Black Jack, a great scout and a terror to the\nIndians. In his way, he was fond of Willet, Tayoga and young Lennox,\nand he felt also that he would like Grosvenor when he knew him better.\nSo, while they slept, he watched with a vigilance that nobody save\nTayoga could surpass.",
        "Black Rifle saw the life of the forest go on undisturbed. The birds on\nthe boughs went about their business, and the little animals worked\nor played as usual in the bushes. Everything said to him that no enemy\nwas near, and his own five senses confirmed it. The afternoon passed,\nand, about twilight, Tayoga awoke, but the others slept on.",
        "“Sleep now, Black Rifle,” said the Onondaga. “I will take up the\nwatch.”",
        "“I don’t feel like closing my eyes just yet, Tayoga,” replied the\nscout, “and I’ll sit a while with you. Nothing has happened. Tandakora\nhas not been able to find our trail.”",
        "“But he will hunt long for it, Black Rifle. When my race hates it\nhates well. Tandakora feels his grudge against us. He has tried to do\nus much harm and he is grieved because we have not fallen before him.\nHe blames us for it.”",
        "“I know he does. Did you hear something walking in the thicket at the\nbottom of the hill?”",
        "“It is only a bear. Perhaps he is looking for a good place in which to\npass the night, but he will go much farther away.”",
        "“Why, Tayoga?”",
        "“Because the wind is shifting about a little, and, in another minute,\nit will take him a whiff of the human odor. Then he will run away, and\nrun fast. Now he is running.”",
        "“I don’t hear him, Tayoga, but I take it that you know what you are\nsaying is true.”",
        "“My ears are uncommonly keen, Black Rifle. It is no merit of mine that\nthey are so. Why should a man talk about a gift from Manitou, when it\nreally is the work of Manitou? Ah, the bear is going toward the south\nand he is well frightened because he never stops to look back, nor\ndoes he hesitate! Now he is gone and he will not come back again!”",
        "Black Rifle glanced at the Onondaga in the dusk, and his eyes were\nfull of admiration.",
        "“You have wonderful gifts, Tayoga,” he said. “I don’t believe such\neyes and ears as yours are to be found in the head of any other man.”",
        "“But, as I have just told you, Black Rifle, however good they may\nbe the credit belongs to Manitou and not to me. I am but a poor\ninstrument.”",
        "“Still you find ’em useful, and the exercise of such powers must yield\na certain pleasure. They’re particularly valuable just now, as I’m\nthinking we’ll have an eventful night.”",
        "“I think so too, Black Rifle. With the warriors and the French so near\nus it is not likely that it could pass in peace.”",
        "“At any rate, Dave and the lads are not worrying about it. I never saw\nanybody sleep more soundly. I reckon they were pretty well worn out.”",
        "“So they were, and, unless danger comes very close, we will not awaken\nthem. That it will be near us soon I do not doubt because Tododaho\nwarns me that peril is at hand.”",
        "He was looking up at the star on which his patron saint sat and his\nface had that rapt expression which it always wore when his spirit\nleaped into the void to meet that of the great Onondaga chief who\nhad gone away four hundred years ago. Black Rifle regarded him with\nrespect. He too was steeped in Indian lore and belief, and, if Tayoga\nsaid he saw and heard what others could not hear or see, then he saw\nand heard them and that was all there was to it.",
        "“What do you see, Tayoga?” he asked.",
        "“Tododaho sits on his star with the wise snakes, coil on coil in\nhis hair, and the great Mohawk, Hayowentha, who is inferior only to\nTododaho, speaks to him from his own star across infinite space. They\nare talking of us, but it comes only as a whisper, like the dying\nvoice of a distant wind, and I cannot understand their words. But both\nthe great warriors look down warningly at us. They tell us to beware,\nthat we are threatened by a great peril. I can read their faces. But\na mist is passing in the heavens. The star of the Mohawk fades. Lo,\nit is gone! And now the vapors gather before the face of Tododaho too.\nLo, he also has gone, and there are only clouds and mists in the far\nheavens! But the great chiefs, from their stars, have told us to watch\nand to watch well.”",
        "“I believe you! I believe every word you say, Tayoga,” exclaimed Black\nRifle, in a tone of awe. “The mist is coming down here too. I think\nit’s floating in from the lake. It will be all over the thickets soon.\nI reckon that the danger threatening us is from the warriors, and\nif we are in a veil of fog we’ll have to rely on our ears. I’m not\nbragging when I say that mine are pretty good, but yours are better.”",
        "Tayoga did not reply. He knew that the compliment was true, but, as\nbefore, he ascribed the credit to Manitou because he had made the gift\nand not to himself who was merely an involuntary agent. The mist and\nvapors were increasing, drifting toward them in clouds from the lake,\na vanguard of shreds and patches, already floating over the bushes in\nwhich they lay. It was evident that soon they would not be able to see\nfive yards from there.",
        "In ten minutes the mist became a fog, white and thick. The sleeping\nthree were almost hidden, although they were at the feet of the\nwatchers, and the two saw each other but dimly. They seemed to be in\na tiny island with a white ocean circling about them. The Onondaga lay\nflat and put his ear to the earth.",
        "“What do you hear, Tayoga?” whispered the scout.",
        "“Nothing yet, Black Rifle, but the usual whispers of the wilderness, a\nlittle wind among the trees and a distant and uneasy deer walking.”",
        "“Why should a deer be walking about at this time, and why should he be\nuneasy, Tayoga? Any deer in his right mind ought to be taking his rest\nnow in the forest.”",
        "“That is true, Black Rifle, but this deer is worried and when a deer\nis worried there is a cause. A deer is not like a man, full of fancies\nand creating danger when danger there is none. He is troubled because\nthere are strange presences in the woods, presences that he dreads.”",
        "“Maybe he scents us.”",
        "“No, the wind does not blow from us toward him. Do not move! Do not\nstir in the least, Black Rifle! I think I catch another sound, almost\nas light as that made by a leaf when it falls! Ah, Manitou is good to\nme! He makes me hear to-night better than I ever heard before, because\nit is his purpose, I know not why, to make me do so! There comes the\nlittle sound again and it is real! It was a footstep far away, and\nthen another and another and now many! It is the tread of marching men\nand they are white men!”",
        "“How do you know they are white men, Tayoga?”",
        "“Mingled with the sound of their footsteps is a little clank made\nby the hilts of swords and the butts of pistols striking against the\nmetal on their belts. There is a slight creaking of leather, too,\nwhich could not possibly come from a band of warriors. I hear the echo\nof a voice! I think it is a command, a short, sharp word or two such\nas white officers give. The sounds of the footsteps merge now, Black\nRifle, because the men are marching to the same step. I think there\nmust be at least fifty of them. They are sure to be French, because\nwe are certain our troops are not yet in this region, and because only\nthe French are so active that they make these swift marches at night.”",
        "“Unfortunately that’s so, Tayoga. Will they pass near us?”",
        "“Very near us, but I do not think they will see us, as the fog is so\nthick.”",
        "“Should we wake the others and move?”",
        "“No, at least not yet. Now they are going very slowly. It is not\nbecause they do not know the way, but because the fog troubles them.\nIt is St. Luc who leads them.”",
        "“I don’t see how your ear can tell you that, Tayoga.”",
        "“It is not my ear, it is my mind that tells me, Black Rifle. The\nFrench would not go through the forest to-night, unless they had\nwarriors with them as guides, flankers and skirmishers. Only St. Luc\ncould make them come, because we know that even the French have great\ntrouble in inducing them to enter big battles. They like better ambush\nand foray. De Courcelles could not make them march on this journey nor\ncould Jumonville. My reason tells me it could be only St. Luc. It must\nbe!”",
        "“Yes, I’m sure now it’s St. Luc up to some trick that we ought to\nmeet.”",
        "“But we do not know what the trick is, Black Rifle. Ah, they have\nstopped! All of them have stopped!”",
        "“It is not possible that they have seen any traces of us, Tayoga! We\nleft no trail. Besides, this fog is so thick and heavy; it’s like a\nblanket hiding everything!”",
        "“No, it is not that. We left no trail. They are so near that we could\nsee them if there were no fog. Now I hear some one walking alone in\nfront of the company. His step is quick, sharp and positive. It is St.\nLuc, because, being the leader, he is the only one who would walk that\nway at such a time. I think he wants to see for himself or rather feel\njust where they are. Now he too stops, and some one walks forward to\njoin him. It is a Frenchman, because he has on boots. I can hear just\nthe faintest creak of the leather. It must be De Courcelles.”",
        "“It may be his comrade Jumonville.”",
        "“No, it is De Courcelles, because he is tall while Jumonville is not,\nand the stride of this man who is going forward to join St. Luc is\nlong. It is surely De Courcelles. St. Luc does not like him, but he\nhas to use him, because the Frenchmen are not many, and a leader can\nonly lead those who are at hand to be led. Now they talk together.\nPerhaps they are puzzled about the direction.”",
        "“Well, so would I be if I had to go anywhere in such a fog.”",
        "“They walk back together to the soldiers, and now there is no noise of\nfootsteps.”",
        "“I take it that they’re waiting for something.”",
        "“Aye, Black Rifle. They are waiting in the hope that the fog will\nrise. You know how suddenly a fog can lift and leave everything bright\nand clear.”",
        "“And they would see us at once. They’ll be fairly on top of us.”",
        "“So they would be, if the fog should go quickly away.”",
        "“And do you think it will?” asked Black Rifle in alarm.",
        "Tayoga laughed under his breath.",
        "“I do not,” he replied confidently. “There is no wind to take it away.\nThe great bank of mist and vapor will be heavy upon the ground and\nwill increase in thickness. It would not be wise for us to move,\nbecause there may be ears among them as keen as ours, and they might\nhear us. Then blinded by the fog we might walk directly into the hands\nof prowling warriors. Although we are not many yards from them we are\nsafest where we are, motionless and still.”",
        "Black Rifle also lay down and put his ear to the earth.",
        "“I hear very well myself, although not as well as you, Tayoga,” he\nwhispered, “and I want to notice what they’re doing as far as I can.\nI make out the sound of a lot of footsteps, but I can’t tell what they\nmean.”",
        "“They are sending groups in different directions, Black Rifle, looking\nfor a way through the forest rather than for us. They are still\nuncertain where they are. Five or six men are going southward, about\nas many have turned toward the west, and two warriors and a Frenchman\nare coming toward us, the rest stay where they are.”",
        "“It’s the three coming in our direction who are bothering me.”",
        "“But remember, Black Rifle, that we are hidden in the deep fog as a\nfish is hidden in the water, and it will be almost as hard to find us.\nThey must step nearly upon us before they could see us.”",
        "Black Rifle, in his eventful life upon the border, had passed through\nmany a crisis, but never any that tested his nerves more thoroughly\nthan the one he now faced. He too heard the steps of the three\nwarriors coming in their direction, cautiously feeling a way through\nthe great bank of mist. It was true that they could pass near without\nseeing, but chance might bring them straight to the little group. He\nshifted his fingers to the lock and trigger of his rifle, and looked\nat the sleeping three whose figures were almost hidden, although they\nwere not a yard away. He felt that they should be awake and ready but\nin waking, Grosvenor, at least, might make enough noise to draw the\nwarriors upon them at once.",
        "“They have shifted their course a little,” whispered Tayoga, “and\nit leads to our right. Now they change back again, and now they keep\nturning toward the left. I think they will pass eight or ten yards\nfrom us, which will be as good as five hundred or a thousand.”",
        "The white man slowly raised his rifle, but did not cock it. That\naction would have made a clicking sound, sharp and clear in the fog,\nbut the quick hands were ready for instant use. He knew, as Tayoga\nhad said, that the chance of the warriors walking upon them in the\nblinding fog was small, but if the chance came it would have to be met\nwith all their power and resource.",
        "“I think they will come within about ten feet of us,” continued\nTayoga, in his soft whisper. “There are two tall warriors and one\nquite short. The tall ones take about three steps to the short one’s\nfour and even then the short man is always behind. They do not walk\nin single file as usual, but spread out that they may cover as much\nground as possible. Now they are coming very near and I think it best,\nBlack Rifle, that I talk no more for the present, but I will hold my\nrifle ready as you are doing, if unlucky chance should bring them upon\nus.”",
        "The footsteps approached and passed a little to the left, but came so\nnear that Black Rifle almost fancied he could see the dim figures\nin the fog. When they went on he drew a mighty breath and wiped the\nperspiration from his face.",
        "“We fairly grazed the edge of death,” he whispered. “I’ll sit up now\nand you can do the rest of the listening all by yourself, Tayoga.”",
        "“The three have rejoined the main body,” said the Onondaga, “and the\nother parties that went out have also gone back. I think the one that\nwent south probably found the way in which they wanted to go, and they\nwill now move on, leaving us safe for the while. Yes, I can hear them\nmarching and the clank of the French weapons and equipment.”",
        "He listened a few minutes longer, and then announced that they were\nquite beyond hearing.",
        "“They are gone,” he said, “and Great Bear, Dagaeoga, and Red Coat have\nnot even known that they were here.”",
        "“In which they were lucky,” said Black Rifle.",
        "The scout awoke the three, who were much astonished to learn that such\ndanger had passed so near them. Then they considered what was best for\nthem to do next.",
        "“It is quite evident,” said Robert, as they talked, “that we must\nfollow on the trail of St. Luc. We’ve settled in our minds that\nhe wants to keep our people busy along Lake George, while Montcalm\nfortifies higher up. Then it’s our duty to find out what he’s doing\nand stop it if we can.”",
        "All were in agreement upon the point, even Grosvenor, who did not yet\nfeel at home in the woods.",
        "“But we must wait until the fog lifts,” said Willet. “If we moved now\nwe might walk directly into the arms of the enemy, and we can afford\nto wait the night through, anyhow. Tayoga, we have got to keep you\nfresh, because your senses and faculties must be at their finest and\nmost delicate pitch for trailing, so now you go to sleep. All the rest\nof you do the same, and I’ll watch.”",
        "Soon four slumbered, and only the hunter was awake and on guard. But\nhe was enough. His sight and hearing were almost as good as those of\nTayoga himself and he too began to believe that the Onondaga’s Manitou\nwas a shield before them. Danger had come often and very near, but\nit had always passed, and, for the present, at least, he was not\napprehensive. The fog might hang on all night if it chose. They\ncould easily make up lost ground in the morning. Meanwhile they were\naccumulating fresh strength. The four were sleeping very placidly, and\nit was not likely that they would awake before dawn. Willet looked at\ntheir relaxed figures with genuine benevolence. There were the friends\nfor whom he cared most, and he felt sure the young Englishman also\nwould become an addition. Grosvenor was full of courage and he had\nalready proved that he was adaptable. He would learn fast. The hunter\nhad every reason to be satisfied with himself and the situation.",
        "The fog did not go away. Instead, it thickened perceptibly, rolling\nup in new waves from the lake. The figures of the sleeping four were\nwrapped in it as in a white blanket, but Willet knew they were there.\nNo air stirred, and, as he sat silent, he listened for sounds that\nmight come through the white veil, hearing only the occasional\nstirring of some animal. Toward morning the inevitable change\noccurred. A wind arose in the south, gentle puffs in the beginning,\nthen blowing steady and strong. The fog was torn away first at the\ntop, where it was thinnest, floating off in shreds and patches, and\nthen the whole wall of it yielded before the insistent breeze, driven\ntoward the north like a mist, and leaving the woods and thickets free.\nWillet made a careful circle about the camp, at a range of several\nhundred yards, and found no sign of hostile presence. Then he resumed\nhis silent vigil, and, an hour later, the sun rose in a shower of\ngold. Tayoga opened his eyes and Willet awakened the others.",
        "“The fog is gone,” said the hunter, “and eyes are useful once more.\nI’ve been around the camp and there is no immediate threat hanging\nover us. We can enjoy a good breakfast on Black Rifle’s cold bear, and\nthen we’ll start on St. Luc’s trail.”",
        "The path of the force that had marched past in the night was quite\nplain. Even Grosvenor, with his inexperience, could tell that many\nmen had walked there. Most of the Frenchmen as well as the Indians\nhad worn moccasins, but the imprints made by the boot heels of De\nCourcelles and Jumonville were clearly visible among the fainter\ntraces.",
        "“How many men would you say were in this force, Tayoga?” asked Willet.",
        "“About fifty Frenchmen and maybe as many warriors,” replied the\nOnondaga. “The Frenchmen stay together, but the warriors leave now\nand then in little parties, and the trail also shows where some of the\nparties came back. See, Red Coat, here is where two warriors returned.\nThe French stay with St. Luc, not because they are not good scouts and\ntrailers, but because the division of the work now allots this task to\nthe Indians.”",
        "“You’re right when you call the French good scouts and trailers,” said\nWillet. “They seem to take naturally to forest life, and I know the\nIndians like them better than they do any other white people. As I\noften tell Robert, here, the French are enemies of whom anybody can be\nproud. There isn’t a braver race in the world.”",
        "“I don’t underrate ’em,” said Grosvenor.",
        "“It won’t be long until we reach their camp,” said Tayoga. “Sharp\nSword is too great a leader to have carried his men very far in a\nblind fog. I do not think he went on more than a mile. It is likely\nthat he stopped at the first brook, and the slope of the ground shows\nthat we will come soon to a stream. More of the scouts that he sent\nout are returning to the main trail. They could not have gone far in\nthe fog and of course they found nothing.”",
        "“We’ll have, then, to beware lest we run into their camp before\nthey’ve left it,” said Willet.",
        "“I don’t think Sharp Sword would stay there after dawn,” continued the\nOnondaga. “The fact that he marched at night in the fog shows that he\nis eager to get on, and I am quite sure we will find a cold camp. Here\ngo the footsteps of St. Luc. I know they are his, because his foot\nis small and he wears moccasins. All the French soldiers have larger\nfeet, and the other two Frenchmen, De Courcelles and De Jumonville,\nwear boots. Sharp Sword does not regard the two officers with favor.\nHe does not associate with them more than is necessary. He keeps\non the right side of the trail and they on the left. Here go his\nmoccasins and there go their boots.”",
        "“And straight ahead is the brook by the side of which we’ll find their\ncamp,” said Robert, who had caught the silver flash of water through\nthe green foliage.",
        "The trail, as he had said, led to the brook where the signs of an\nencampment were numerous.",
        "“The fog was dense with them as it was with us,” said Tayoga. “It is\nshown by the fact that they moved about a great deal, walking over all\nthe ground, before they finally chose a place. If there had been no\nfog or even only a little they could have chosen at once what they\nwanted. Knowing that they had no enemy strong enough to be feared they\nkindled a fire here by this log, more for the sake of light than for\nwarmth. Sharp Sword did not talk over anything with his lieutenants,\nDe Courcelles and Jumonville. His trail leads to the north side of the\ncamp, where he wrapped himself in his blanket and lay down. I imagine\nthat the Canadian, Dubois, who goes with him, as an attendant, watched\nover him. De Courcelles and Jumonville slept on the other side of the\ncamp. There go their boots. All the French soldiers but Dubois lay\ndown to sleep, and only the warriors watched. They left at dawn, not\nstopping to eat breakfast. If they had eaten, birds would be here\nhunting shreds of flesh in the grass, but we do not see a single bird,\nnor has any wolf or other prowling animal been drawn by the odor of\nfood. We were right in our surmise that Sharp Sword did not wish to\ndelay. Perhaps there is some force of ours that he can catch in a\ntrap, and he wishes to repeat his success against the Mountain Wolf.”",
        "“And it is our business to stop him,” said Willet.",
        "“If so, we must act promptly, Great Bear. When Sharp Sword makes up\nhis mind to strike he strikes, quick and hard. After his brief camp\nhere he continued his march toward the south. He threw out warriors as\nscouts and skirmishers. You can see their trail, leading off into the\nwoods, and then his main force marched in a close and compact group.\nJust beyond the camp a little while after they made the new start he\ncalled De Courcelles and De Jumonville to him, and talked with them\na little. Here is where his moccasins stood, and here is where their\nboots stood, facing him, while they received his orders. Then the\nboots walked back to the end of the line and St. Luc must have spoken\nto them very sharply.”",
        "“Why do you say that, Tayoga?” asked Grosvenor.",
        "“You will notice that here where the trails of boots turn back the\nstems of grass in two or three places are broken off, not crushed\ndown. De Courcelles and Jumonville kicked them in anger with the sharp\ntoes of their boots, and they could have been angry only because Sharp\nSword rebuked them.”",
        "“You must be right, Tayoga.”",
        "“It does not admit of any doubt, Red Coat. They took their places at\nthe rear of the marching line, and Sharp Sword went on ahead. At no\ntime does he permit them to walk beside him. He still regards the two\nFrenchmen with much disfavor, and he will continue to do so though he\nmust use them in his expedition.”",
        "Tayoga spoke in his precise school English, in which he never omitted\nor abbreviated a word, but he was very positive. It did not occur to\nany of the others to doubt him. They had seen too many evidences of\nhis surpassing skill on the trail. They swung along and Grosvenor\nnoticed that many birds now appeared, hopping about in the path, as if\nsearching among the bushes and in the grass for something.",
        "“It looks as if they were seeking food dropped by our foes,” he said.",
        "“Did we not say that Red Coat would learn and learn fast!” exclaimed\nTayoga. “He has in him the spirit of the forester, and, in time, he\nwill make a great trailer. I have observed the birds, Red Coat, and\nyour conclusion is correct. Sharp Sword’s force did not pause to cook\nbreakfast or even to eat it at the camp, but they took it as they\nwalked along swiftly, dropping shreds of flesh or grains of hominy\nor bones picked clean as they walked. The birds have come to feast on\ntheir leavings. Doubtless, they have eaten all already and are merely\nhunting for more that does not exist. It is strange that no prowling\nwolf has come. Ah, I see the nose of one now in the thicket! Sharp\nSword and his force cannot be very far ahead, and we shall have to be\nvery cautious how we proceed.”",
        "“I think it likely,” said Willet, “that Tandakora and his band will\njoin him soon. If he is intending an attack upon us somewhere he will\nwant to mass his full strength for it.”",
        "“Tandakora will join him before he makes his next camp,” said Tayoga,\nin the most positive manner. “Great Bear reasons well. I expect to see\nthe trail of the Ojibway chief, within an hour.”",
        "They went forward slowly, lest they walk into an ambush set by the\nfoe, and, before they had gone two miles, the Onondaga pointed to a\nnew trail coming out of the forest and merging into that of St. Luc.",
        "“Dagaeoga knows who has walked here!” he said.",
        "“Yes,” replied Robert. “It’s easy to tell where the great feet of\nTandakora have passed. I suppose he leaves bigger footprints than any\nother man now in the province of New York. His warriors were with him\ntoo when he joined St. Luc. We were right in supposing that the French\nleader meditates an attack upon us somewhere.”",
        "“Tandakora talked a while with St. Luc,” said Tayoga, when they\nhad gone a hundred yards farther. “The big moccasins and the small\nmoccasins stood together beside the trail. The earth was dampened much\nby the fog last night and it leaves the impressions. I think he talked\nlonger with the Ojibway than he did with De Courcelles and Jumonville.\nTandakora is an evil man but perhaps St. Luc feels less dislike for\nhim than he does for the two white men. The Ojibway is only a savage\nfrom the region of the Great Lakes, but the Frenchmen should know\nthat the straight way of life is the right way. You do not forget,\nDagaeoga, how De Courcelles planned with the others that time we were\nin Quebec, to have you killed by the bully, Boucher!”",
        "“I don’t forget it,” said Robert. “I can never forget it, nor do I\nforget how Dave took my place and sent the bully to a land where he\ncan never more do murder. Much as I hate Tandakora, I don’t blame St.\nLuc for hating him less than he does De Courcelles and Jumonville.”",
        "“After the talk they went on together to the head of the line,\"\nsaid Tayoga. “Now they increase their speed. The stride of St. Luc\nlengthens and as it lengthens so must those of all the rest. We are\nnot now in any danger of running into them, but we may incur it before\nnight.”",
        "They did not abate their own speed, but continued in the path without\npause, until nearly noon. The broad trail led straight on, over hills,\nacross valleys and always through deep forest, cut here and there\nby clear streams. The sun came out, and it was warm under the trees.\nGrosvenor, unused to such severe exertion of this kind, began to\nbreathe with difficulty. But Tayoga called a halt in time at the edge\nof a brook, and all knelt to drink.",
        "“St. Luc’s men were tired and thirsty too, Red Coat,” said the\nOnondaga. “All of them drank. You can see the prints of their knees\nand feet as they bent over the water. It is a good brook. Manitou\nhas filled the wilderness with its like, that man and beast may enjoy\nthem. We will rest here a while, if Great Bear and Black Rifle say\nso.”",
        "“We do,” said the two men together.",
        "They remained fully an hour by the little stream. Robert himself,\nused as he was to the wilderness, was glad of the rest, and Grosvenor\nfairly reveled in it, feeling that his nerves and muscles were\nbeing created anew. They also made further inroads on their bear\nand Grosvenor was glad to see the birds coming for the shreds\nthey dropped. He had quite a kindly feeling for the little winged\ncreatures.",
        "“I don’t want to think that everything in the woods is an enemy,” he\nsaid.",
        "When they resumed the pursuit they found another new trail merging\ninto that of the main force. It was a mixed band, red and white as the\ncharacter of the footprints showed, and numbered about twenty men.",
        "“It is clear,” said Tayoga, “that as we supposed, Sharp Sword is\nplanning a heavy stroke. All the detached forces are coming in, under\ninstructions, to join him. We know that Montcalm drew back into the\nnorth after his great blow at Fort William Henry, and we think he is\ngoing to fortify on Champlain or between the two lakes. Some of our\npeople must be along the shores of Andiatarocte and Sharp Sword does\nnot want them to find out too much about Montcalm.”",
        "“At any rate I think our own enterprise will culminate before night,\"\nsaid Willet. “We should overtake them by dusk if we try.”",
        "“Sharp Sword’s men will make a new camp before long,” said Tayoga,\n\"and from that they will launch their attack upon whatever point or\nforce of ours they intend to attack. They are not going so fast now,\nand the trail is growing very warm. Sharp Sword’s stride is shortening\nand so, of course, is the stride of all the others. I think he now\nfeels that the need of hurrying is over, and he is likely to become\nmuch more deliberate.”",
        "“And the ground is beginning to slope down toward a deep valley,” said\nWillet. “Water and wood will be plentiful there, and I think that’s\nwhere St. Luc will make his camp to-night.”",
        "“I think so too,” said Tayoga. “And since the dusk is not far away\nmaybe they have lighted the fire already. Suppose, Great Bear, we\nclimb the hill on our right and see if our eyes can reach their\nsmoke.”",
        "The crest of the hill was about three hundred feet above them, but\nwhen they reached it they could see a great distance on all sides,\nthe lake a vast glittering bowl on their left and the mighty green\nwilderness of hills, mountains and woods on their right. Directly\nahead of them was a faint dark line against the dazzling blue of the\nsky.",
        "“Smoke!” said Tayoga.",
        "“St. Luc’s smoke,” said Willet.",
        "“The very smoke of the camp for which we were looking and which we\nwere expecting!” said Black Rifle.",
        "Robert’s pulses beat hard, as they always did when he knew the great\nFrench Chevalier to be near. But that emotion soon passed and in\nits place came the thought of the enemy’s presence. However much\nhe admired St. Luc he was an official foe, to be met upon the\nbattlefield.",
        "“We must look into their camp,” he said.",
        "“So we must,” said Willet, “and to do that we shall have to go much\nnearer. The risk is too great now, but it will soon be night, and then\nwe can approach. We can see them well, then, because they’ll build all\nthe fires they like, since they think they have nothing to fear.”",
        "Then the five waited in silence among the thick woods on the crest of\nthe hill, and Grosvenor prepared his mind for his first stalk. Full of\ncourage, ambitious, eager to excel, he resolved to acquit himself with\ncredit. But this was war, far different from that on the open fields\nof Europe for which his early training had fitted him. One must lie\nin the deep forest and depend upon the delicacy of eye and ear and an\nexceeding quickness of hand. It had not been long since he would\nhave considered his present situation incredible, and, even now, it\nrequired some effort to convince himself that it was true.",
        "But there beside him were the comrades whom he liked so well, Robert,\nTayoga and the hunter whom he had known before and the strange dark\nfigure of Black Rifle, that man of mystery and terror. Around him was\nthe wilderness now in the glow of advancing twilight, and before him\nhe knew well lay St. Luc and the formidable French and Indian force.\nTime and place were enough to try the soul of an inexperienced youth\nand yet Grosvenor was not afraid. His own spirit and willingness\nto dare peril made a shield for him. His comrades were only four in\nnumber, but Grosvenor felt that, in fact, they were twenty. He did\nnot know what strange pass into which they would lead him, but he felt\nsure they would succeed.",
        "He saw the red rim of the sun sink behind the western crests, and then\nthe last twilight died into the night. Heavy darkness trailed over the\nforest, but soon moon and stars sprang out, and the sky became silver,\nthe spire of smoke reappearing across its southern face. But Willet,\nwho was in reality the leader of the little party, gave no sign.\nGrosvenor knew that they were waiting for the majority of St.\nLuc’s force to go to sleep, leaving only the sentinels before they\napproached, but it was hard to sit there so long. His nerves were on\nedge and his muscles ached, but his spirit put a powerful rein over\nthe flesh and he said never a word, until far in the night Willet gave\nthe order to advance.",
        "“Be careful, lads,” he said, “and now is your chance, Lieutenant, to\nshow how well you can keep up the start you’ve made as a trailer. That\nsmoke over there which merges from several camp fires is our beacon.”",
        "They crept through the thickets. Grosvenor saw the dark gray tower\nagainst the sky grow larger and larger, and at last a luminous glow\nthat came from the camp fires, rose under the horizon.",
        "“To the edge of this last hill,” whispered Willet, “and I think we can\nsee them.”",
        "They redoubled their care as they advanced, and then, thrusting their\nheads through the bushes, looked down into the little valley in which\nthe camp of St. Luc was pitched.",
        "Several fires were burning, and Robert distinctly saw the French\nleader standing before one of them, not in forest green, but in his\nsplendid officer’s uniform of white and silver. A gallant and romantic\nfigure he looked, outlined by the blaze, young, lithe and strong.\nAgain the heart of the lad throbbed, and he was drawn powerfully\ntoward St. Luc. What was it that caused this feeling and why had the\nChevalier on more than one occasion and at risk shown himself to be\nhis friend?",
        "Not as many in the camp as they had expected had yet gone to sleep.\nTandakora, somber and gigantic, gnawed the flesh from the big bone of\na deer and then, throwing the bone into the fire, approached St. Luc.\nRobert saw them talking and presently De Courcelles and Jumonville\ncame also. The four talked a little while and now and then the\nChevalier pointed toward the south.",
        "“That is where they intend their blow to fall,” whispered Tayoga.",
        "“Beyond a doubt, lad,” the hunter whispered back, “but we may be able\nto anticipate ’em.”",
        "The wild scene, the like of which he had never looked upon before,\ncast a strange spell over Grosvenor. He too recognized, even at the\ndistance, the power of St. Luc’s personality, and Tandakora, looming,\nimmense, in the firelight, was like some monster out of an earlier,\nprimordial world. Warriors and soldiers asleep were scattered before\nthe fires, and, at the edge of the forest, walked the sentinels. It\nwas an alert and formidable camp, and the young Englishman felt that\nhe and his comrades were grazing the extreme edge of danger.",
        "De Courcelles and Jumonville presently left St. Luc and went to\nanother fire, where they lay down and fell asleep, their military\ncloaks spread over them. Then the short, dark Canadian Dubois appeared\nand St. Luc spoke to him also. Dubois bowed respectfully and brought a\nblanket, which he spread before the fire. St. Luc lay down on it, and\nhe too was soon asleep.",
        "“It’s time for us to go,” whispered Willet, “but I’d feel safer\nif Tandakora also went to sleep. That savage is likely to send out\nscouts.”",
        "“Tandakora does not mean to sleep to-night,” said Tayoga. “He suspects\nthat we are somewhere near and he is troubled. If he were not uneasy\nhe would take his rest, which is what a chief always does when the\nopportunity presents itself. But he has thrown his second bone into\nthe fire, and he walks about, looking now at the sleepers and now at\nthe forest. I think he will soon send two or three runners toward the\nsouth. See, he is speaking to them now, and two are starting.”",
        "Two Indians left the camp and glided silently into the woods. Then\nTandakora stopped his restless pacing, and lay down on the ground. His\nface was in the shadow, but he seemed to be asleep.",
        "The four on the hill crept away as cautiously as they had come,\nand they agreed that they would make a curve around St. Luc’s camp,\ntraveling all night toward the south. Willet was anxious about the\ntwo warriors whom Tandakora had sent out, and he felt that they might\npossibly encounter them on the way. He led his little group first\ntoward the lake and then bore south, being quite sure that before noon\nthe next day they would reach a British or American detachment of some\nkind. Everything indicated such proximity and they were agreed that\nthey would find their friends on the shores of the lake. It was not\nlikely that either colonials or regulars would leave the open water\nand go far into woods which furnished so many perils.",
        "They were refreshed by sleep and plenty of food and they made good\ntime. They walked in single file, Willet leading with Tayoga last and\nGrosvenor in front of him. The young Englishman’s ambition, encouraged\nby success, was rising higher than ever, and he was resolved that this\nnight trail which he was treading should be a good one, so far as he\nwas concerned. Robert walked in front of him and he was careful to\nstep exactly where young Lennox did, knowing that if he did so he\nwould break no sticks and make no undue noise. The test was severe,\nbut he succeeded. By and by his breath grew short once more.\nNevertheless he was glad when Willet halted, and asked Tayoga if he\nheard any unusual sound in the forest. Before replying the Onondaga\nlay down and put his ear to the ground.",
        "“I do hear a sound which is not that of the trees nor of an animal,\"\nhe replied. “It is made by men walking, and I think they are the two\nwarriors whom Tandakora sent out from the camp.”",
        "“And if you can hear them walking they must be very near. That is\nsure.”",
        "“It is true, Great Bear. These two warriors are sent south to spy upon\nwhatever force of ours St. Luc means to attack, and it may be that\nthey will strike our trail, although they are not looking for it.\nThere is light enough now to show our traces to good trailers.”",
        "“Aye, Tayoga, you speak truly. Lie down, lads, we must not show\nourselves. It’s possible that they’ll pass on and not dream of our\npresence here.”",
        "“It is in the hands of Manitou,” said the Onondaga gravely. “They are\nstill walking toward the south at an even pace, which shows that they\nhave seen nothing. I can hear their footfalls, only a whisper against\nthe earth, but unmistakable. Now, they are just behind us, and\ntheir course is the same as ours. Ah, the footfalls cease! They have\nstopped. They have seen our trail, Great Bear. Manitou has given his\ndecree against us, and who are we to complain? He has done so much for\nus that now he would put us to the test, and see whether we are worthy\nof his favor. We shall have to fight the messengers.”",
        "“It should be easy enough for us who are five to beat two warriors,\"\nsaid Robert.",
        "“We can surely beat two,” said Tayoga, “but they will try to hold us\nwhile they call help. It will not be long before you hear the cry of a\nnight bird, doubtless an owl.”",
        "“Have they begun to move again?” asked Robert.",
        "“I cannot hear a sound. Perhaps they are stirring, but they creep so\ncautiously that they make no noise at all. It would be their object\nto make their own position uncertain and then we would go on at great\nperil from their bullets. It will be best for us to stay a while where\nwe are.”",
        "Tayoga’s words were accepted at once as wise by the others. It was\nimpossible to tell where the two warriors now lay, and, if they\nundertook to go on, their figures would be disclosed at once by the\nbrilliant moonshine. So they flattened themselves against the ground\nin the shadow of the bushes and waited patiently. The time seemed to\nGrosvenor to be forever, but he thrilled with the belief in coming\ncombat. He still felt that he was in the best of all company for\nforest and midnight battle, and he did not fear the issue.",
        "Willet was hopeful that the skies would darken, but they did not do\nso. The persistent moon and a host of stars continued to shine down,\nflooding the forest with light, and he knew that if any one of them\nstood up a bullet would be his instant welcome. At last came the\ncry of the night bird, the note of the owl, as Tayoga had predicted,\nrising from a point to their right and somewhat behind them, but too\nfar away for rifle shot. It was a singular note, wild, desolate and\nfull of menace.",
        "“There may have been another band of warriors in this direction,\"\nwhispered Tayoga, “perhaps a group of hunters who had not yet returned\nto St. Luc, and he is calling to them.”",
        "“No earthly doubt of it,” said Black Rifle. “Can you hear the reply,\nTayoga?”",
        "“Now I hear it, though it is very faint. It is from the south and the\nwarriors will soon be here. We shall have a band to fight.”",
        "“Then we’d better bear off toward the west,” said Willet. “Come, lads,\nwe have to creep for it.”",
        "They made their way very slowly on hands and knees away from the\nlake, Willet leading and Tayoga bringing up the rear. It was hard\nand painful work for Grosvenor, but again he succeeded in advancing\nwithout noise, and he began to think they would elude the vigilance of\nthe savage scouts, when a sibilant whisper from Willet warned them to\nfall flat again. His command was just in time as a rifle cracked in\nthe bushes ahead of them, and Grosvenor distinctly heard the bullet as\nit hissed over their heads. Willet threw his rifle to his shoulder but\nquickly took it down again. The Indian who had fired was gone and a\nlittle puff of smoke rising above the bushes told where he had been.\nThen the five crept away toward the right and drew into a slight\nhollow, rimmed around with bushes, where they lay hugging the earth.",
        "“Our course took us almost directly into the path of that fellow,\"\nsaid Willet, “and of course he saw us. I’m sorry I didn’t get a shot\nat him.”",
        "“Do not worry, Great Bear,” said Tayoga. “You will find plenty of use\nfor your bullets. The band has come. Hark to the war whoop!”",
        "The long, piercing yell, so full of menace and most sinister in its\ndying note, swelled through the forest. Grosvenor, despite his courage\nand confidence in his comrades, shivered. He had heard that same yell\nmany a time, when Braddock’s army was cut down in the deep forest by\nan invisible foe. He could never forget its import. But he grasped\nhis rifle firmly, and strove to see the enemy, who, he knew, was\napproaching. His four comrades lay in silence, but the muzzle of every\nweapon was thrust forward.",
        "“It’s fortunate we found this little hollow,” said Willet. “It will\ngive us shelter for a while.”",
        "“And we’ll need it,” said Black Rifle. “They know where we are, of\ncourse, but they’ll take their time about attacking.”",
        "“Keep your heads down, lads,” said Willet. “Don’t be too eager to see.\nIf they’re too far away for us to shoot at we are too far away for\nthem too.”",
        "Five minutes later and a flash came from a thicket on their left.\nWillet pulled trigger at the flash and a death cry came back.",
        "“That’s one out of the way,” said Black Rifle calmly, “and they’re mad\nclean through. Hear ’em yell!”",
        "The fierce war whoop died in many echoes, and bullets spattered the\nrocks about them. The five made no further reply as yet, but the\nforest battle was now on.",
        "Robert and Grosvenor lay, side by side, propped up partly on their\nelbows, their rifles thrust well forward, and watching toward the\nnorth. They were not able to see anything, save the dark outline of\nthe forest, and a little puff of smoke rising where an Indian had\nfired. The wilderness itself was absolutely still but Robert’s vivid\nimagination as usual peopled it thickly. Although his eye did not\nreach any human figure his mind pictured them everywhere, waiting\npatiently for a chance at his comrades and himself. He, more than\nany other of the five, realized the full extent of the danger. His\nextraordinary fancy pictured to him every possibility, and so his\ncourage was all the greater, because he had the strength to face them\nwith a tranquil mind.",
        "A flash in the thicket and a bullet struck on a rock near Robert,\nglanced off and buried itself in a tree beyond them. He shivered a\nlittle. Fancy pictured the bullet not as missing, but as hitting him.\nThen he steadied himself, and was as ready as Willet or Black Rifle\nfor whatever might come.",
        "“I think that shot was fired by a sharpshooter who has crept forward\nahead of the others,” whispered the hunter. “He’s lying behind that\nlow bush to the west.”",
        "“I’m of your mind about it,” said Black Rifle. “As soon as he reloads\nhe’ll chance another shot at where he thinks we’re lying, and that\nwill be his last.”",
        "Robert heard the low words, and he shivered again a little. He could\nnever grow used to the taking of human life, even in dire necessity.\nHe knew that Willet had spoken the truth, and that the red\nsharpshooter would fire only one more shot. Soon he had the proof. The\nsecond flash came from the same point. Again the bullet glanced among\nthe rocks, but, before the report of the rifle died, another answered.\nIt was that of the hunter and he found his mark. A cry came from the\nbush, followed by a fierce yell of anger from those farther back, and\nthen the sinister stillness settled again over the wilderness.",
        "“The Indian has gone!” whispered Grosvenor in an awed tone to Robert.",
        "“Yes, Dave fired at the flash, and he never misses. The cry showed it.\nBut it will make the warriors all the more eager to take us.”",
        "The silence lasted about a quarter of an hour, and then fire was\nopened upon them from three sides, bullets singing over their heads,\nor spattering upon the rocks.",
        "“Lie flat, lads,” commanded Willet. “This is random lead, and if we\nkeep close to the earth ’twill all pass us by. The warriors are seldom\ngood marksmen.”",
        "But one of the bullets, glancing from a rock, nipped Black Rifle in\nthe shoulder. It was a very slight wound, though, and its only effect\nwas to make him more eager to reach his enemy. In a few minutes his\nchance came as he caught a glimpse of a dusky but incautious figure\namong the trees, and, quick as a flash, drew trigger on it. There was\nno cry, but he saw the shadowy figure go down, not to rise again, and\nthe fierce soul of Black Rifle was satisfied.",
        "Scattered shots were fired, after another silence, and a bullet grazed\nthe back of Grosvenor’s hand, drawing a drop or two of blood. It stung\nfor a few moments, but, on the whole, he was proud of the little hurt.\nIt was a badge of honor, and made him truly a member of this great\nforest band. It also stimulated his zeal, and he became eager for a\nshot of his own. He watched intently and when the warriors fired again\nhe sent his bullet at the flash, as he had seen Willet and Black Rifle\ndo. He did not know whether he had hit anything, but he hoped. Tayoga,\nwho fired for the first time presently brought down a warrior, and\nRobert wounded another. But Willet and Black Rifle talked together in\nwhispers and they were anxious.",
        "“They won’t try to rush us so long as we keep among the rocks,” said\nthe hunter. “They know now that we’re good shots, but they’ll hold us\nhere until day when their main force will come up and then we’ll be\nfinished.”",
        "“It seems pretty certain that’s their plan now,” said the scout, “and\nbetween you and me, Dave, we’ve got to get away from here somehow.\nThe moon has faded a bit, and that will help us a little. What do you\nthink, Tayoga?”",
        "“We did not escape other traps to remain here in this,” replied the\nOnondaga. “We must take the chance and go.”",
        "“In half an hour, perhaps. When the clouds floating up there get well\nbefore the moon.”",
        "Robert heard them distinctly and he glanced at the moon which was\nsteadily growing paler, while the shadows were deepening over the\nforest. Yet it was obvious that it would not become very dark, and the\nhalf hour of which Willet had spoken would probably measure the limit\nof the increase.",
        "“Can you hear them moving in the bush, Tayoga?” asked Willet.",
        "The Onondaga put his ear to the ground.",
        "“Only a light sound toward the north reaches me,” he replied.\n\"Warriors there seem to be moving about. It may be that they have\nreceived more help. I think, Great Bear, that the time for us to go,\nif we go at all, is coming fast.”",
        "Willet decided in a few minutes that it would not be any darker than\nit was then; and, choosing a southern direction, he crept from the\nrocks, the others following him in line, Tayoga as usual bringing up\nthe rear. They made a hundred yards in silence, and, then, at a\nlow signal from the hunter, they sank down, almost flat, every one\nlistening for a sound from the besiegers. Only Tayoga was able to hear\nfaint noises to right and left.",
        "“They do not know yet that we have left the rocks,” he whispered, “and\nthey are still watching that point. Manitou may carry us in safety\nbetween them.”",
        "They were about to resume their painful creeping, when a half dozen\nrifles on their right flashed, and they dropped down again. But the\nbullets did not come their way, instead they rang among the rocks\nwhich they had just left. Tayoga laughed softly.",
        "“They think we are still there,” he whispered, “and they send much\nlead against the inoffensive stone. The more the better for us.”",
        "“I’m devoutly glad the rocks catch what is intended for us,” said\nGrosvenor, feeling intense relief. “How long do you think it will be,\nTayoga, before I can stand up and walk like a man again?”",
        "“No one can answer that question,” replied the Onondaga. “But\nremember, Red Coat, that you are getting splendid practice in the\nart of going silently along a trail on a dark night. It is what every\nforest runner must learn.”",
        "Grosvenor in the dusk could not see the twinkle in Tayoga’s eye,\nbut, drawing upon fresh founts of courage and resolution, he settled\nhimself anew to his task. His elbows and knees ached and it was\ndifficult to carry his rifle as he crawled along, but his ambition was\nas high as ever, and he would not complain. The lone hoot of an owl\ncame from the point on the right, where one of the Indian groups\nlay, and it was promptly answered by a like sound from the left where\nanother group was hidden.",
        "“I think they’re beginning to suspect that we may have slipped away,\"\nsaid Willet, “and they’re talking to one another about it. Now they’ll\nstalk the rocks to see, but that will take time, which we can use\nhandily. Come on, lads, we’ll go as fast as possible.”",
        "Curving around a small hill, Willet rose to his feet and the others,\nwith intense relief, did likewise. Robert’s and Grosvenor’s joints\nwere young and elastic, and the stiffness quickly left them, but\nboth had done enough creeping and crawling for one night. All stood\nlistening for a minute or two. They heard no more shots fired at the\nrocks, but the two owls began to call again to each other.",
        "“Do you understand them, Tayoga?” asked Willet.",
        "“They talk the Huron language,” replied the Onondaga, in his precise\nfashion, “that is, their signals are those used by the Hurons. They\nare asking each other what has happened at the rocks, and neither can\ntell. Their expression is that of doubt, impatience and worry. They\nsay to each other: ’Those whom we believed we held in a trap may have\nbroken out of it. It will take time to see and also much peril if they\nare still in the trap, because they can use their rifles well.’ We\nannoy them much, Great Bear.”",
        "The big hunter chuckled.",
        "“I don’t mind that,” he said. “Their worries are not my worries. Ah,\nthere they go again! What are they saying now, Tayoga?”",
        "“Their tone grows more anxious. You can tell what they feel by the\nexpression of the owl. Their fear that we may have stolen out of the\ntrap is increasing, but they cannot know unless they go and see, and\nthen they may be creeping into the muzzles of our rifles. It is a\ndifficult problem that we have given them to solve, Great Bear.”",
        "“We’ll leave it for ’em, lads. Now that we’re on our feet we’ll go at\nspeed.”",
        "They walked very rapidly, but they stopped when they heard once more\nthe faint cries of the owls, now almost lost in the distance. Tayoga\ninterpreted them.",
        "“They are cries of anger,” he said. “They have discovered that we are\nnot in the rocks, and now they will look around for our trail, which\nwill be hard to find in the darkness of the night.”",
        "“And the thing for us to do is to keep on toward the south as hard as\nwe can.”",
        "“So it would be, Great Bear, but others are coming up from the south,\nand we would go directly into their arms.”",
        "“What do you mean, Tayoga?”",
        "“A number of men are advancing, and I think they are warriors.”",
        "“Then we have merely slipped out of one trap to fall into another.”",
        "“It is possible, Great Bear. It is also possible that those who come\nare friends. Let me put my ear to the earth, which is the bringer of\nsound. It is clear to me that those who walk toward us are warriors.\nWhite men would not tread so lightly. I do not think, Great Bear,\nthat any force of the Indians who are allied with the French would be\ncoming up from the south, and the chances are that these be friends.”",
        "He sent forth the call of a bird, a beautiful, clear note, and it was\nanswered instantly with a note as clear and as beautiful.",
        "“They are friends!” said Tayoga joyfully. “These be the Ganeagaono!”",
        "“Ganeagaono?” exclaimed Grosvenor.",
        "“Mohawks,” explained Robert. “The Keepers of the Eastern Gate. The\nleading warriors of the Six Nations and friends of ours. We are, in\ntruth, in luck.”",
        "Ten dusky figures came forward to meet them, and with great joy Robert\nrecognized in the leader the fierce young Mohawk chief, Daganoweda,\nwho once before had come to their help in a crisis. But it was Tayoga\nwho welcomed him first.",
        "“Daganoweda, of the clan of the Turtle, of the nation, Ganeagaono,\nof the great League of the Hodenosaunee, the sight of you is very\npleasant to our eyes,” he said.",
        "“Tayoga, of the clan of the Bear, of the Nation, Onondaga, of the\ngreat League of the Hodenosaunee, you are my brother and we are well\nmet,” the chief rejoined.",
        "They saluted each other and then Daganoweda greeted the others, all\nof whom were known to him of old save Grosvenor, but who was presented\nduly in the ceremonious style loved by the Iroquois.",
        "“We are pursued by men of Tandakora,” said Willet. “They are not far\naway now. We do not wish to fight them because we would hasten below\nwith a warning.”",
        "The black eyes of the fierce Mohawk flashed.",
        "“Will the Great Bear give us his battle?” he said.",
        "He asked for it as if for a favor.",
        "“We usually fight our own quarrels through,” replied Willet, “but as\nI said, duty calls us from here in haste. Then, since you wish it,\nDaganoweda, we pass the fight to you. But have you enough men?”",
        "“Ten Mohawks are enough to meet any wandering band of our enemies that\nmay be in the woods,” replied the young chief, proudly. “Let Great\nBear and his friends go in peace. This fight is ours.”",
        "Despite the dusk, Robert saw Daganoweda’s eyes glisten. He thoroughly\nunderstood the fierce soul of the young Mohawk chief, who would not\nlet such a brilliant opportunity for battle pass him.",
        "“Then farewell, Daganoweda,” said Willet. “You have been a friend at\nthe right moment.”",
        "He led again in the flight toward the south and the five saw the chief\nand his warriors passing the other way sink into the dusk. Soon they\nheard shots behind them and they knew that the Mohawks were engaged\nin battle with the Hurons and their friends. They sped on for a long\ntime, and when they stopped they were close to the shores of the lake,\nthe water showing dimly through the trees.",
        "“I think we may rest easy for a while now,” said Willet. “I’m certain\nnot one of those warriors was able to get by the Mohawks, and it’s\nnot likely that an enemy is within several miles of us. Can you hear\nanything, Tayoga?”",
        "“Nothing,” replied the Onondaga. “Tododaho, on his star, tells me that\nwe have this part of the forest to ourselves.”",
        "“That being so, we’ll stay here a long time. Lads, you might unroll\nyour blankets and make the best of things.”",
        "Grosvenor’s blanket had not been taken from him when he was a\nprisoner, and it was still strapped on his back. He and Robert found\nthe rest most welcome and they were not slow in wrapping the blankets\naround their bodies and making themselves comfortable. Without willing\nit, they fell asleep, but were awakened shortly after dawn.",
        "“See!” said Willet, pointing toward the south.",
        "A filmy trail of blue smoke rose across the clear, blue sky.",
        "“That, whatever it is,” said the hunter, “is what St. Luc is advancing\nagainst, but in spite of all the risks we’ve run we’ll be there in\ntime to give warning.”",
        "Robert looked with the deepest interest at the smoke, which was a long\nway off, but it seemed to rise from the lake’s edge and he thought\nit must be a British or American post. It was at a most exposed and\ndangerous point, but his heart thrilled at Willet’s words. Yes, in\nspite of every danger that had been thrown across their path, they\nwould be able to carry word in time.",
        "“We’ll be there in half an hour, and we’ll know what’s going forward,\"\nsaid Willet.",
        "“We’ll know before then,” said Grosvenor confidently. “Our marvelous\nIndian friend here will tell us when we’re half way.”",
        "Tayoga smiled, but said nothing, and they started again, Willet, as\nusual, leading, and the Onondaga bringing up the rear. The spire of\nsmoke thickened and darkened, and, to Robert and Grosvenor, it seemed\nmost friendly and alluring. It appeared to rise from a little point of\nland thrust into the lake but they could not yet see its base, owing\nto an intervening hill. Just before they reached the crest of the hill\nTayoga said:",
        "“Wait a moment, Great Bear. I think I hear a sound from the place\nwhere the smoke rises, and we may be able to tell what it means.”",
        "They stopped promptly, and the Onondaga put his ear to the earth.",
        "“I hear the sounds very distinctly now,” he said. “They are of a kind\nnot often occurring on these shores.”",
        "“What are they?” asked Robert eagerly.",
        "“They are made by axes biting into wood. Many men are cutting down\ntrees.”",
        "“They’re building a fort, and they’re in a hurry about it or they\nwould not be felling trees so early in the morning.”",
        "“Your reasoning about the hurry is good, Dagaeoga. The white man will\nnot go into the forest with his ax at daybreak, unless the need of\nhaste is great, but it is not a fort they build. Mingled with the fall\nof the axes I hear another note. It is a humming and a buzzing. It is\nheard in these forests much less often than the thud of the ax. Ah!\nI was in doubt at first, but I know it now! It is the sound made by a\ngreat saw as it eats into the wood.”",
        "“A saw mill, Tayoga!”",
        "“Yes, Dagaeoga, that is what it is, and now mind will tell us why it\nis here. The logs that the axes cut down are sawed in the mill. The\nsaw would not be needed if the logs were to be used for building a\nfort. The ax would do it all. The logs are being turned into planks\nand boards.”",
        "“Which shows that they’re being used for some purpose requiring much\nfiner finish than the mere building of a fort.”",
        "“Now the mind of Dagaeoga is working well. Great Bear and I have been\non the point where the new saw mill stands.”",
        "“And the timber there is fine,” interrupted Willet.",
        "“Just the kind that white men use when they build long boats for\ntraveling on the lakes, boats that will carry many men and armband\nsupplies. We know that a great army of red coats is advancing. It\nexpects to come up George and then probably to Champlain to meet\nMontcalm and to invade Canada. It is an army that will need hundreds\nof boats for such a purpose, and they must be built.”",
        "“And they’re building some of ’em right here on this point, before\nus!” exclaimed Robert.",
        "Tayoga smiled.",
        "“It is so,” he said precisely. “There cannot be any doubt of it. A saw\nmill could not be here for any other purpose. But if we had not come\nit would be destroyed or captured before night by St. Luc.”",
        "“Come on, lads, and we’ll soon be among ’em,” said Willet.",
        "From the crest of a hill they looked down upon a scene of great\nactivity. The sun was scarcely risen but more than fifty men were at\nwork on the forest with axes, and, at the very edge of the water, a\nsaw mill was in active operation. Along the shore, where as many more\ntoiled, were boats finished and others in all stages of progress.\nSoldiers in uniform, rifles on shoulder, walked about.",
        "It was a pleasant sight, refreshing to the eyes of Robert and\nGrosvenor. Here were many men of their own race, and here were many\nactivities, telling of great energy in the war. After so much peril\nin the forest they would be glad to be in the open and with their own\nkind again.",
        "“Look, Robert,” said Willet, “don’t you know them?”",
        "“Know whom?” asked young Lennox.",
        "“The officers of this camp. The lads in the brave uniforms. If my eyes\nmake no mistake, and they don’t make any, the fine, tall young fellow\nstanding at the edge of the water is our Philadelphia friend, Captain\nColden.”",
        "“Beyond a doubt it is, Dave, and right glad am I to see him, and there\ntoo is Wilton, the fighting Quaker, and Carson also. Why this is to\nbe, in truth, a reunion!”",
        "Willet put his hands to his mouth trumpet fashion, and uttered a long,\npiercing shout. Then the five advanced and marched into the camp\nof their friends, where they received a welcome, amazed but full of\nwarmth, Grosvenor, too, being made to feel at home.",
        "“Have you dropped from the skies?” asked Colden.",
        "“Scarcely that,” replied Robert, laughing with pleasure, “but we’ve\nbeen shot out of the forest, and very glad we are to be here. We’ve\ncome to tell you also that we’ve been pursued by a strong French and\nIndian force, led by St. Luc himself, and that it will be upon you\nbefore nightfall.”",
        "“And I, trained in my boyhood not to fight, will have to fight again,\"\nsaid Wilton.",
        "“I know that none will do it better,” said Robert.",
        "“But we will give you breakfast,” said Colden, “and while you are\neating I will put the camp in a posture of defense. We are here\nbuilding boats to be used by the army in its advance against Montcalm,\nand we didn’t know that the enemy in force was south of Crown Point.”",
        "There were several sheds and in one of these a most abundant breakfast\nwas served to them, including coffee and white bread, neither of which\nthey had seen in a long time, and which were most welcome. While they\nate, they saw the young Pennsylvania officers arranging their forces\nwith skill and rapidity.",
        "“They’ve learned a lot since we were with ’em that time at Fort\nRefuge,” said Robert.",
        "“They’ve had to learn,” said Willet. “The forests in these times are a\nhard teacher, but they’re bright and good boys, just the same. Nobody\nwould learn faster.”",
        "“Even as Red Coat has learned to be a scout and to know the trail,\"\nsaid Tayoga, “but he is not sorry to come among white men and to have\ngood food once more.”",
        "“No, I’m not,” said Grosvenor emphatically. “My ambition to be a fine\ntrailer was high last night, and it’s still with me, but I had enough\nof creeping and crawling to last me a long time, and if we have to\nfight again I think I can fight better standing up.”",
        "“We will have to fight again. Be sure of that,” said Tayoga\ndecisively.",
        "Before breakfast was over Colden came to them, and Robert told,\nin detail and with great vividness, all they had seen. The young\nPhiladelphia captain’s face became very grave.",
        "“It was you who warned us before Fort Refuge,” he said, “and now you\ncome again. You helped us to success then, and you’ll help us now.\nEven if your coming does bring news of danger I’ll consider it a good\nomen.”",
        "“We’ll be proud to stand in line with you once more,” said Robert,\nalthough he felt that, with St. Luc in command, the attack of the\nFrench and Indians would be formidable. Colden would have available\nfor battle between one hundred and fifty and two hundred men, about\nfifty of whom were soldiers. But all the others, the boat builders\nand the rest, were capable fighters too. They could certainly make a\npowerful resistance even to the daring and skillful French Chevalier,\nand, with a certain number of boats finished, the lake also was open\nto them, in case retreat became necessary. Luckily, too, St. Luc had\nno cannon. Courageous Captain Colden considered their situation far\nfrom desperate. There was hope too that Daganoweda and his Mohawks\nmight come, not only those he had with him in the night battle, but\nothers as well. The Mohawks, loving a combat, would not let go by such\na one as that now threatening.",
        "Willet rose from his breakfast and surveyed the position. There were\nno real buildings, only sheds, the largest covering the saw mill, and\nthe others used for the protection of tools and of the men, when they\nslept, against the weather. All the trees for a distance well beyond\nrifle shot had been cut away for timber, a lucky fact, as the hostile\nIndians could not now use them for ambush. Stout arms were throwing\nthe fallen trees into a long line of breastworks, and the place\nalready began to look like a fortified point. Willet’s eyes glistened.",
        "“Although St. Luc beat us when we were with Rogers,” he said, “I\nthink we’ll hold him here. We’ve certain advantages that will help us\nmightily.”",
        "“Thanks to you and your comrades for bringing us such timely warning,\"\nrepeated Colden. “I’ll confess that I did not suspect any enemy was\nnearer than Champlain, and neither we nor our superiors at Albany have\nfeared an attack here.”",
        "“It’s sure to come,” said Willet.",
        "Grosvenor, refreshed and reinvigorated, was taking an active share\nin the preparations. He had smoothed and brushed his uniform with\nscrupulous care, and despite the great hardships through which he\nhad passed, looked once more neat and trim. He had returned to his\nincarnation as a trim young British officer. Adaptable and liking the\nAmericans, equipped moreover with a certain experience of the border,\nhe was at once on the best of terms with Colden, Wilton, Carson and\nthe others, and was, in truth, one of them. Wilton found him a belt\nand a small sword, which he buckled on, and which as a badge of office\ngave him a certain moral strength, making him in fact a thoroughly\nhappy man that morning.",
        "Black Rifle, after food, had slid quietly into the forest to spy out\nthe enemy. Robert, flexible, vivid, his imagination always alive, was\nwith Tayoga, helping him with the breastworks, and keeping an eye at\nthe same time on the forest. The lake behind him stretched away, vast,\npeaceful and beautiful, but he seldom looked at it now. He did not\nanticipate danger that way. It would come through the woods.",
        "A gradual slope, hemmed in on either side by high cliffs and only a\nfew hundred yards wide, led to the point on which the saw mill stood.\nSt. Luc must approach by the slope. The cliffs were impossible, and,\nthe longer he looked at it, the better Robert liked the position.\nDaring men such as Colden had could hold it against a much larger\nforce. Let St. Luc come, he would find a brave and ready defense.",
        "“Dagaeoga thinks we can hold the saw mill even against Sharp Sword,\"\nsaid Tayoga.",
        "“How do you know I think it?”",
        "“Because it is printed on Dagaeoga’s face. When Dagaeoga’s fancy is\nalive, which is nearly all the time, his eyes speak and they tell one\nvery clearly what he thinks. His eyes say that the slope is narrow;\nSt. Luc can come that way only; we have here more than one hundred and\nfifty good rifles; and in face of the storm of lead that we can send\nagainst him he cannot rush us. That is what the eyes and face of\nDagaeoga say.”",
        "“You’re right, Tayoga, that is what my brain thinks, though I didn’t\nknow it was printed on my face. But it’s all the easier for you to\nread it, because you’re probably thinking the same that I do.”",
        "“I do, Dagaeoga. Since St. Luc is not able to effect a surprise, he\nhas a great task before him, though he will persist in it, because he\nwants to destroy our force and our boats also.”",
        "But the morning passed without any demonstration from the forest.\nMany of the boat builders began to believe it was a false alarm, and\nmurmured at the continuous and hard labor on the breastworks, but\nColden, knowing that Willet and his friends were to be trusted\nimplicitly, held them to their tasks. The hunter also looked into the\nquestion of food supply and found it ample. They had brought much food\nwith them from Albany and the forest had furnished much more. There\nwas no occasion for alarm on that point, since the siege could not be\na long one. Noon came and no sign of the enemy. Willet began to think\nthe attack would be postponed until night, as St. Luc doubtless had\nlearned already that he could not carry the place by surprise. But he\nrelied most upon the word of Black Rifle who had not yet returned\nfrom the forest. The dark scout came back about the middle of the\nafternoon, and he told Colden and Willet that he had seen nothing\nof Daganoweda and his Mohawks, though there were indications in the\nforest that they had defeated the Hurons the night before. But St. Luc\nWas at hand, not much more than a mile away, where he had pitched a\ncamp. More French and Canadians had arrived and he now led a force of\nat least five hundred men, the great majority of whom were warriors.\nHe thought an attack would be made after dark, but in what form it was\nimpossible to say.",
        "“Which means,” said Colden, “that I must have sentinels who will never\nrelax their vigilance.”",
        "“Particularly as the night is going to be dark,” said Willet. “There’s\na haze over the lake now, and the sun will set in a mist.”",
        "The twilight was heavy as he had predicted, and it was soon black on\nthe mountains and the lake. But within the camp fires were burning,\nthrowing a cheerful light, and many guards were posted. Crude but\neffective fortifications stretched all along the forest side of the\ncamp, and Willet, Black Rifle and Tayoga were among the stumps in\nfront of them. No enemy would be able to hide there even in the night.\nWagons in which they had brought their supplies were drawn up in\na circle, and would form an inner line of defense. Robert was with\nGrosvenor and Wilton near the center of the camp.",
        "“Knowing the French and Indians as I now do,” said Wilton, “I never\ndoubt for an instant that an attack will come before morning. My\nexperience at Fort Refuge is sufficient indication. It is strange that\nI, who was reared not to believe in fighting, should now be compelled\nto do it all the time.”",
        "“And while my profession is fighting,” said Grosvenor, “I always\nexpected to fight in the open fields of Europe and now I’m learning my\ntrade in the deep forests of North America, where it’s quite another\nsort of business. How long do you think it will be, Lennox, before we\nhear the owls hoot and the wolves bark?”",
        "Robert laughed.",
        "“We’ve had a lot of such signals in the last few days,” he replied,\n\"but in this country battles are not always opened with ’em. Still, I\ndare say we’ll hear ’em.”",
        "Out of the forest in front of them came a long, lonely hoot.",
        "“Speak of the owl and you hear his voice,” said Wilton.",
        "“If Tayoga were here he could tell us exactly what that owl, who is\nno owl but an Indian, meant,” said Grosvenor, “also the tribe of the\nIndian, his age, his complexion, what he had for supper, how he is\nfeeling and whether he is married or single. Oh, I assure you,\nWilton, you needn’t smile! I’ve seen the Onondaga do things much more\nmarvelous. Nothing short of trailing a bird through the air would\nreally test his wilderness powers.”",
        "“I wasn’t smiling at your belief, Grosvenor,” said the young Quaker,\n\"I was merely smiling at your earnestness. When you tell me anything\nabout Tayoga’s skill on the trail I shall believe it, I don’t care\nwhat it is. I saw him do marvelous things when we were at Fort\nRefuge.”",
        "The owl ceased its melancholy cry, and no other sound came from the\nforest, while the camp waited, with as much patience as it could\nmuster, for the attack.",
        "Light clouds floated before the moon, and the surface of the lake\nwas ruffled by a southern wind. As no attack was anticipated from the\nsouth, the guard in that quarter was comparatively small, but it was\ncomposed, nevertheless, of good men, the boat builders mostly, but all\nexperienced with the rifle and under the direct command of Carson. But\nthe main force was always kept facing the forest, and, there, behind\nthe logs, Colden stood with the four–Black Rifle again being outside.\nThe hooting of the owls had not been repeated and the long wait had\nbecome hard upon the nerves of the young Philadelphia captain.",
        "“Do you feel sure that they will attack to-night?” he asked Willet.\n\"Perhaps St. Luc, seeing the strength of our position, will draw off\nor send to Montcalm for cannon, which doubtless would take a week.”",
        "The hunter shook his head.",
        "“St. Luc will not go away,” he said, “nor will he send for cannon,\nwhich would take too long. He will not use his strength alone, he will\ndepend also upon wile and stratagem, against which we must guard every\nminute. I think I’ll take my own men and go outside. We can be of more\nservice there.”",
        "“I suppose you’re right, but don’t walk into danger. I depend a lot on\nyou.”",
        "Willet climbed over the logs. Tayoga, Robert and Grosvenor followed.",
        "“Red Coat buckled on a sword, and I did not think he would go on a\ntrail again,” said Tayoga.",
        "“One instance in which you didn’t read my mind right,” rejoined the\nEnglishman. “I know that swords don’t belong on the trail, but this is\nonly a little blade, and you fellows can’t leave me behind.”",
        "“I did read your mind right,” said Tayoga, laughing softly. “I merely\nspoke of your sword to see what you would say. I knew all the time\nthat you would come with us.”",
        "The stumps, where the forest had been cut away, stretched for a\ndistance of several hundred yards up the slope, and, a little distance\nfrom the breastwork, the dark shadow of Black Rifle came forward to\nmeet them.",
        "“Nothing yet?” asked the hunter.",
        "“Nothing so far. Three or four good men are with me among the stumps,\nbut not a warrior has yet appeared. I suppose they know we’ll be on\nwatch here, and it’s not worth while taking so great a risk.”",
        "They advanced to the far edge of the stump region and crouched there.\nThe night was now quite dark, the moon almost hidden, the stars but\nfew, and the forest a solid black line before them.",
        "“Why can’t Tayoga use his ears?” said Grosvenor. “He’ll hear them,\nthough a mile away.”",
        "“A little farther on and he will,” replied Willet, “but we, in our\nturn, don’t dare to go deep into the forest.”",
        "A hundred yards more and the Onondaga put ear to earth, but it was a\nlong time before he announced anything.",
        "“I hear footsteps fairly near to us,” he said at last, “and I think\nthey are those of warriors. They would be more cautious, but they do\nnot believe we are outside the line of logs. Yes, they are warriors,\nall warriors, there is no jingle of metal such as the French have\non their coats or belts, and they are going to take a look at our\nposition. They are about to pass now to our right. I also hear\nsteps, but farther away, on our left, and I think they are those of\nFrenchmen.”",
        "“Likely De Courcelles and Jumonville wanting also to look us over,\"\nsaid Willet.",
        "“There is another and larger force coming directly toward us,\"\ncontinued the Onondaga, “and I think it includes both French and\nwarriors. This may be the attack and perhaps it would be better for us\nto fall back.”",
        "They withdrew a little, but remained among the stumps, though hidden\ncarefully. Robert himself could now hear the advance of the large\nforce in front of them, and he wondered what could be St. Luc’s plan\nof battle. Surely he would not try to take the sawmill by storm in\nface of so many deadly rifles!",
        "Black Rifle suddenly left the others and crept toward the right.\nRobert’s eyes followed him, and his mind was held by a curious sort of\nfascination. He knew that the scout had heard something and he almost\ndivined what was about to occur. Black Rifle stopped a moment or two\nat a stump, and then curved swiftly about it. A dusky figure sprang\nup, but the war cry was choked in the throat of the Huron, and then\nthe knife, wielded by a powerful arm, flashed. Robert quickly turned\nhis eyes away, because he did not wish to see the fall of the blade,\nand he knew that the end was certain. Black Rifle came back in a few\nmoments. His dark eyes glittered, but he had wiped the knife, and it\nwas in his belt again.",
        "“His comrades will find him in a few minutes,” said Willet, “and we’d\nbetter not linger here.”",
        "“They went back toward the sawmill and presently they heard a terrible\ncry of rage, a cry given for the fallen warrior.",
        "“I don’t think I shall ever grow used to such yells,” said Grosvenor,\nshuddering.",
        "“I’ve never grown used to ’em yet,” said Robert.",
        "The shout was followed by a half dozen shots, and a bullet or two\nwhistled overhead, but it was clear that all of them had been fired\nat random. The warriors, aware that the chance of surprise had passed,\nwere venting their wrath in noise. Willet suddenly raised his own\nrifle and pulled the trigger. Another dusky figure sprang up and then\nfell prone.",
        "“They were coming too close,” he said. “That’ll be a warning. Now\nback, lads, to the breastwork!”",
        "As they retreated the shots and yells increased, the forest ringing\nwith the whoops, while bullets pattered on the stumps. Both Grosvenor\nand Robert were glad when they were inside the logs once more, and\nColden was glad to see them.",
        "“For all I knew you had fallen,” he said, “and I can’t spare you.”",
        "“We left our mark on ’em,” said the saturnine Black Rifle. “They know\nwe’re waiting for ’em.”",
        "The demonstration increased in volume, the whole forest ringing with\nthe fierce whoops. Stout nerves even had good excuse for being shaken,\nand Colden paled a little, but his soul was high.",
        "“Sound and fury but no attack,” he said.",
        "Willet looked at him approvingly.",
        "“You’ve become a true forest leader, Captain Colden,” he said. “You’ve\nlearned to tell the real rush from the pretended one. They won’t try\nanything yet a while, but they’re madder than hornets, and they’re\nsure to move on us later. You just watch.”",
        "Yet Colden, Wilton and the others were compelled to argue with the\nmen, especially with the boat builders and wood choppers. Stern\nmilitary discipline was unknown then in the forest; the private often\nconsidered himself a better man than his officer, and frequently told\nhim so. Troops from the towns or the older settled regions seemed\nnever to grow used to Indian methods of warfare. They walked again and\nagain into the same sort of ambush. Now, they felt sure, because the\nIndian fire had evaporated in scattered shots, that the French and the\nwarriors had gone away, and that they might as well be asleep, save\nfor the guards. But Colden repressed them with a stern hand.",
        "“If it hadn’t been for our experience at Fort Refuge I might feel that\nway myself,” he said. “The silence is certainly consoling, and makes\none feel that all danger has passed.”",
        "“The silence is what I dread most,” said Robert. “Is anything stirring\non the lake?”",
        "“Not a thing,” replied Wilton, who had been watching in that quarter.\n\"I never saw George look more peaceful.”",
        "Robert suggested that they go down to the shore again, and Wilton,\nGrosvenor and he walked through the camp, not stopping until they\nstood at the water’s edge.",
        "“You surely don’t anticipate anything here,” said Wilton.",
        "“I don’t know,” replied Robert, thoughtfully, “but our enemies, both\nFrench and Indians, are full of craft. We must guard against wile and\nstratagem.”",
        "Wilton looked out over the lake, where the gentle wind still blew and\nthe rippling waters made a slight sighing sound almost like a lullaby.\nThe opposite cliffs rose steep and lofty, showing dimly through the\ndusk, but there was no threat in their dark wall. To south and north\nthe surface melted in the darkness, but it too seemed friendly and\nprotecting. Wilton shook his head. No peril could come by that road,\nbut he held his peace. He had his opinion, but he would not utter it\naloud against those who had so much more experience than he.",
        "The darkness made a further gain. The pallid moon went wholly out, and\nthe last of the stars left. But they had ample wood inside the camp\nand they built the fires higher, the flames lighting up the tanned\neager faces of the men and gleaming along the polished barrels of\ntheir long rifles. Willet had inspected the supply of ammunition and\nhe considered it ample. That fear was removed from his mind.",
        "Tayoga went to the edge of the forest again, and reported no apparent\nmovement in the force of St. Luc. But they had built a great fire of\ntheir own, and did not mean to go away. The attack would come some\ntime or other, but when or how no man could tell.",
        "Robert, who could do as he pleased, concluded to stay with Wilton on\nthe shore of the lake, where the darkness was continually creeping\ncloser to the shore. The high cliffs on the far side were lost to\nsight and only a little of Andiatarocte’s surface could now be seen.\nThe wind began to moan. Wilton shivered.",
        "“The lake don’t look as friendly as it did an hour ago,” he said.",
        "A crash of shots from the slope followed his words. The war whoop rose\nand fell and rose again. Bullets rattled among the stumps and on the\ncrude stockade.",
        "“The real attack!” said Wilton.",
        "“Perhaps,” said Robert.",
        "He was about to turn away and join in the defense, but an impulse\nfrom some unknown source made him stay. Wilton’s duty kept him there,\nthough he chafed to be on the active side of the camp. The sharp crack\nof rifles showed that the defenders were replying and they sent forth\na defiant cheer.",
        "“They may creep down to the edge of the stumps and try to pick off our\nmen,” said Robert, “but they won’t make a rush. St. Luc would never\nallow it. I don’t understand this demonstration. It must be a cover\nfor something else.”",
        "He looked thoughtfully into the darkness, and listened to the moan of\nthe lake. Had the foe a fleet he might have expected an attack that\nway, but he knew that for the present the British and Americans\ncontrolled Andiatarocte.",
        "The darkness was still gathering on the water. He could not see twenty\nyards from the land, but behind him everything was brightness. The\nfires had been replenished, the men lined the stockade and were firing\nfast. Cheers replied to whoops. Smoke of battle overhung the camp, and\ndrifted off into the forest. Robert looked toward the stockade. Again\nit was his impulse to go, and again he stayed. There was a slight\ngurgling in the water almost at his feet, and a dark figure rose from\nthe waves, followed in an instant by another, and then by many more.\nRobert, his imagination up and leaping, thrilled with horror. He\nunderstood at once. They were attacked by swimming savages. While\nthe great shouting and turmoil in their front was going on a line of\nwarriors had reached the lake somewhere in the darkness, and were now\nin the camp itself.",
        "He was palsied only for a moment. Then his faculties were alive and he\nsaw the imminent need. Leaping back, he uttered a piercing shout, and,\ndrawing his pistol, he fired point blank at the first of the warriors.\nWilton, who had felt the same horror at sight of the dark faces, fired\nalso, and there was a rush of feet as men came to their help.",
        "The warriors were armed only with tomahawk and knife, and they had\nexpected a surprise which they might have effected if it had not been\nfor Robert’s keenness, but more of them came continually and they\nmade a formidable attack. Sending forth yell after yell as a signal to\ntheir comrades in front that they had landed, they rushed forward.",
        "Neither Robert nor Wilton ever had any clear idea of that fierce\ncombat in the dark. The defenders fired their rifles and pistols,\nif they had time, and then closed in with cold steel. Meanwhile the\nattack on the front redoubled. But here at the water’s edge it was\nfiercest. Borderer met warrior, and now and then, locked in the arms\nof one another, they fell and rolled together into the lake. Grosvenor\ncame too, and, after firing his pistols, he drew his small sword,\nplunging into the thick of the combat, thrusting with deadly effect.",
        "The savages were hurled back, but more swimming warriors came to their\naid. Dark heads were continually rising from the lake, and stalwart\nfigures, almost naked, sprang to the shore. Tomahawks and knives\ngleamed, and the air echoed with fierce whoop of Indian and shout of\nborderer. And on the other side of the camp, too, the attack was now\npressed with unrelenting vigor. The shrill call of a whistle showed\nthat St. Luc himself was near, and Frenchmen, Canadians and Indians,\nat the edge of the cleared ground and in the first line of stumps,\npoured a storm of bullets against the breastwork and into the camp.",
        "Many of the defenders were hit, some mortally. The gallant Colden had\nhis fine three cornered hat, of which he was very proud, shot away,\nbut, bare-headed, calm and resolute, he strode about among his men,\nhandling his forces like the veteran that he had become, strengthening\nthe weak points, applauding the daring and encouraging the faltering.\nWillet, who was crouched behind the logs, firing his rifle with deadly\neffect, glanced at him more than once with approval.",
        "“Do you think we can hold ’em off, Tayoga?” the hunter said to the\nOnondaga, who was by his side.",
        "“Aye, Great Bear, we can,” replied Tayoga. “They will not be able to\nenter our camp here, but this is not their spearhead. They expect\nto thrust through on the side of the water, where they have come\nswimming. Hark to the shouts behind us!”",
        "“And the two lads, Robert and the young Englishman, have gone there.\nI think you judge aright about that being their spearhead. We’ll go\nthere too!”",
        "Choosing a moment when they were not observed by the others, lest it\nmight be construed as a withdrawal in the face of force, they slipped\naway from the logs. It was easy to find such an opportunity as the\ncamp was now full of smoke from the firing, drifting over everything\nand often hiding the faces of the combatants from their comrades only\na few yards away.",
        "But the battle raged most fiercely along the water’s edge. There it\nwas hand to hand, and for a while it looked as if the dusky warriors\nwould make good their footing. To the defenders it seemed that the\nlake spewed them forth continually, and that they would overwhelm with\nweight of numbers. Yet the gallant borderers would not give back, and\nencouraging one another with resounding cheers they held the doubtful\nshore. Into this confused and terrible struggle Willet and Tayoga\nhurled themselves, and their arrival was most opportune.",
        "“Push ’em back, lads! Push ’em back! Into the water with ’em!” shouted\nthe stalwart hunter, and emptying rifle and pistol he clubbed the\nformer, striking terrific blows. Tayoga, tomahawk in hand, went up and\ndown like a deadly flame. Soldiers and borderers came to the danger\npoint, and the savages were borne back. Not one of them coming from\nthe water was able to enter the camp. The terrible line of lead and\nsteel that faced them was impassable, and all the time the tremendous\nshouts of Willet poured fresh courage and zeal into the young troops\nand the borderers.",
        "“At ’em, lads! At ’em!” he cried. “Push ’em back! Throw ’em into the\nwater! Show ’em they can’t enter our camp, that the back door, like\nthe front door, is closed! That’s the way! Good for you, Grosvenor!\nA sword is a deadly weapon when one knows how to use it! A wonderful\nblow for you, Tayoga! But you always deal wonderful ones! Careful,\nRobert! ’Ware the tomahawk! Now, lads, drive ’em! Drive ’em hard!”",
        "The men united in one mighty rush that the warriors could not\nwithstand. They were hurled back from the land, and, after their\nfashion when a blow had failed, they quit in sudden and utter fashion.\nSpringing into the water, and swimming with all their power, they\ndisappeared in the heavy darkness which now hovered close to shore.\nMany of the young soldiers, carried away by the heat of combat, were\nabout to leap into the lake and follow them, but Willet, running up\nand down, restrained their eager spirits.",
        "“No! No!” he cried. “Don’t do that. They’ll be more’n a match for you\nin the water. We’ve won, and we’ll keep what we’ve won!”",
        "All the warriors who had landed, save the dead, were now gone,\nevidently swimming for some point near by, and the battle in front, as\nif by a preconcerted signal, also sank down suddenly. Then St. Luc’s\nsilver whistle was heard, and French and Indians alike drew off.",
        "Robert stood dazed by the abrupt end of the combat. His blood was\nhot, and millions of black specks danced before his eyes. The sudden\nsilence, after so much shouting and firing, made his pulses beat like\nthe sound of drums in his ears. He held an empty pistol in his right\nhand, but he passed his left palm over his hot face, and wiped away\nthe mingled reek of perspiration and burned gunpowder. Grosvenor stood\nnear him, staring at the red edge of his own sword.",
        "“Put up your weapon, Red Coat,” said Tayoga, calmly. “The battle is\nover–for the time.”",
        "“And we’ve won!” exclaimed Grosvenor. “I could hardly believe it was\nreal when I saw all those dark figures coming out of the water!”",
        "Then he shuddered violently, and in sudden excess of emotion flung his\nsword from him. But he went a moment later and picked it up again.",
        "The attack had been repulsed on every side, but the price paid was\nlarge. Fifteen men were dead and many others were wounded. The bodies\nof seventeen Indians who had fallen in the water attack were found\nand were consigned to the waves. Others, with their French allies, had\ngone down on the side of the forest, but most of the fallen had been\ntaken away by their comrades.",
        "It was a victory for Colden and his men, but it left serious alarm for\nthe future. St. Luc was still in the forest, and he might attack again\nin yet greater force. Besides, they would have to guard against many\na cunning and dangerous device from that master of forest warfare.\nColden called a council, at which Willet and Black Rifle were central\nfigures, and they agreed that there was nothing to be done but to\nstrengthen their log outworks and to practice eternal vigilance. Then\nthey began to toil anew on the breastworks, strengthening them with\nfresh timber, of which, fortunately, they had a vast supply, as so\nmuch had been cut to be turned into boats. A double guard was placed\nat the water’s edge, lest the warriors come back for a new attack, and\nthe wounded were made as comfortable as the circumstances would admit.\nLuckily Willet and many others were well acquainted with the rude but\neffective border surgery, much of it learned from the Indians, and\nthey were able to give timely help.",
        "The hurt endured in silence. Their frontier stoicism did not allow\nthem to give voice to pain. Blankets were spread for them under the\nsheds or in the sawmill, and some, despite their injuries, fell asleep\nfrom exhaustion. Soldiers and borderers walked behind the palisades,\nothers continually molded bullets, while some were deep in slumber,\nwaiting their turn to be called for the watch.",
        "It began to rain by and by, not heavily, but a slow, dull, seeping\nfall that was inexpressibly dreary, and the thick, clammy darkness,\nshot with mists and vapors from the lake, rolled up to the very\nedge of the fires. Robert might have joined the sleepers, as he was\ndetached from immediate duty, but his brain was still too much heated\nto admit it. Despite his experience and his knowledge that it could\nnot be so, his vivid fancy filled forest and water with enemies coming\nforward to a new attack. He saw St. Luc, sword in hand, leading them,\nand, shaking his body violently, he laughed at himself. This would\nnever do.",
        "“What does Dagaeoga see that is so amusing?” asked Tayoga.",
        "“Nothing, Tayoga. I was merely ridiculing myself for looking into the\nblackness and seeing foes who are not there.”",
        "“And yet we all do it. If our enemies are not there they are at least\nnot far away. I have been outside with Black Rifle, and we have been\ninto the edge of the forest. Sharp Sword makes a big camp, and shows\nall the signs of intending to stay long. We may yet lose the sawmill.\nIt is best to understand the full danger. What does Dagaeoga mean to\ndo now?”",
        "“I think I’ll go back to the water’s edge, and help keep the watch\nthere. That seems to be my place.”",
        "He found Wilton still in command of the lake guard, and Grosvenor\nwith him. The young Quaker had been shocked by the grim battle, but he\nshowed a brave front nevertheless. He had put on his military cloak to\nprotect himself from the rain, and Robert and Grosvenor had borrowed\nothers for the same purpose.",
        "“We’ve won a victory,” said Wilton, “but, as I gather, it’s not final.\nThat St. Luc, whose name seems to inspire so much terror, will come\nagain. Am I not right, Lennox?”",
        "“You’re right, Wilton. St. Luc will come not a second time only, but a\nthird, and a fourth, if necessary.”",
        "“And can’t we expect any help? We’re supposed to have command of this\nlake for the present.”",
        "“I know of none.”",
        "The three walked up and down, listening to the mournful lapping of the\nwaves on the beach, and the sigh of the dripping rain. The stimulus\nof excited action had passed and they felt heavy and depressed. They\ncould see only a few yards over the lake, and must depend there upon\near to warn them of a new attack that way. The fact added to their\nworries, but luckily Tayoga, with his amazing powers of hearing,\njoined them, establishing at once what was in effect a listening\npost, although it was not called then by that name. Wilton drew\nmuch strength from the presence of the Onondaga, while it made the\nconfidence of Grosvenor supreme.",
        "“Now we’ll surely know if they come,” he said.",
        "A long while passed without a sign, but they did not relax their\nvigilance a particle, and Tayoga interpreted the darkness for them.",
        "“There was a little wind,” he said, after a while, “but it is almost\ndead now. The waves are running no longer. I hear a slight sound to\nthe south which was not there before.”",
        "“I hear nothing, Tayoga,” said Robert.",
        "“Perhaps not, Dagaeoga, but I hear it, which is enough. The sound is\nquite faint, but it is regular like the beating of a pulse. Now I can\ntell what it is. It is the stroke of a paddle. There is a canoe upon\nthe lake, passing in front of us. It is not the canoe of a friend, or\nit would come at once to the land. It contains only one man. How do\nI know, Red Coat? Because the canoe is so small. The stroke of the\npaddle is light and yet the canoe moves swiftly. A canoe heavy enough\nto hold two men could not be moved so fast without a stroke also\nheavy. How do I know it is going fast, Dagaeoga? Do not ask such\nsimple questions. Because the sound of the paddle stroke moving\nrapidly toward the north shows it. Doubtless some of Sharp Sword’s\nwarriors brought with them a canoe overland, and they are now using it\nto spy upon us.”",
        "“What can we do about it, Tayoga?”",
        "“Nothing, Red Coat. Ah, the canoe has turned and is now going back\ntoward the south, but more slowly. The man in it could locate our camp\neasily by the glow of the fires through the mist and vapors. Perhaps\nhe can see a dim outline of our figures.”",
        "“And one of us may get a bullet while we stand here watching.”",
        "“No, Red Coat, it is not at all likely. His aim would be extremely\nuncertain in the darkness. The warrior is not usually a good marksman,\nnor is it his purpose here to shoot. He would rather spy upon us,\nwithout giving an alarm. Ah, the man has now stopped his southward\njourney, and is veering about uncertainly! He dips in the paddle\nonly now and then. That is strange. All his actions express doubt,\nuncertainty and even alarm.”",
        "“What do you think has happened, Tayoga?”",
        "“Manitou yet has the secret in his keeping, Dagaeoga, but if we wait\nin patience a little it may be revealed to me. The canoe is barely\nmoving and the man in it watches. Now his paddle makes a little splash\nas he turns slightly to the right. It is certain that he has been\nalarmed. The spy thinks he is being spied upon, and doubtless he is\nright. He grows more and more uneasy. He moves again, he moves twice\nin an aimless fashion. Although we do not see him in the flesh, it is\neasy to tell that he is trying to pierce the darkness with his eyes,\nnot to make out us, but to discern something very near the canoe. His\nalarm grows and probably with good cause. Ah, he has made a sudden\npowerful stroke, with the paddle, shooting the canoe many feet to the\nleft, but it is too late!”",
        "“Too late for what, Tayoga?” exclaimed Robert.",
        "The Onondaga did not reply for a moment or two, but stood tense and\nstrained. His eyes, his whole attitude showed excitement, a rare thing\nwith him.",
        "“It was too late,” he repeated. “Whatever threatened the man in\nthe canoe, whatever the danger was, it has struck. I heard a little\nsplash. It was made by the man falling into the water. He has gone.\nNow, what has become of the canoe? Perhaps the warrior when he fell\ndropped the paddle into the water, and the canoe is drifting slowly\naway. No, I think some one is swimming to it. Ah, he is in the canoe\nnow, and he has recovered the paddle! I hear the strokes, which are\ndifferent from those made by the man who was in it before. They have\na longer sweep. The new man is stronger. He is very powerful, and he\ndoes not take the canoe back and forth. He is coming toward the land.\nStand here, and we will welcome Daganoweda of the Ganeagaono. It\nmight be some other, but I do not think it possible. It is surely\nDaganoweda.”",
        "A canoe shot from the mists and vapors. The fierce young Mohawk chief\nput down the paddle, and, stepping from the light craft into the\nshallow water, raised his hand in a proud salute. He was truly a\nstriking figure. The dusk enlarged him until he appeared gigantic.\nHe was naked except for belt and breech cloth, and water ran from his\nshining bronze body. A tomahawk and knife in the belt were his only\nweapons, but Robert knew instinctively that one of them had been\nwielded well.",
        "“Welcome, Daganoweda,” he said. “We were not looking for you, but\nif we had taken thought about it we might have known that you would\ncome.”",
        "The dark eyes of the Mohawk flashed and his figure seemed to grow in\nstature.",
        "“There has been a battle,” he said, “and Sharp Sword with a great\nforce is pressing hard upon the white brothers of the Ganeagaono. It\nwas not possible for Daganoweda to stay away.”",
        "“That is true. You are a great chief. You scent the conflict afar, and\nyou always come to it. Our people could have no truer, no braver ally.\nThe arrival of Daganoweda alone is as the coming of ten men.”",
        "The nostrils of the chief dilated. Obviously he was pleased at\nRobert’s round and swelling sentences.",
        "“I come in the canoe of a foe,” he said. “The warrior who was in it\nhas gone into the lake.”",
        "“We know that. Tayoga, who is a wonder for hearing, and a still\ngreater wonder at interpreting what he hears, followed your marvelous\nachievement and told us every step in its progress. He even knew that\nit was you, and announced your coming through the mists and vapors.”",
        "“Tayoga of the clan of the Bear, of the nation Onondaga, of the great\nLeague of the Hodenosaunee, is a great warrior, and the greatest\ntrailer in the world, even though he be so young.”",
        "Tayoga said nothing, and his face did not move, but his eyes gleamed.",
        "“Do you come alone?” asked Robert.",
        "“The warriors who were with me when you met us in the woods are at\nhand,” replied the chief, “and they await my signal. They have crept\npast the line of Sharp Sword, though Tandakora and many men watched,\nand are not far away. I will call them.”",
        "He sent forth twice the harsh cry of a water fowl. There was no\nanswer, but he did not seem to expect any, standing at attention,\nevery line of his figure expressing supreme confidence. The others\nshared his belief.",
        "“I hear them. They come,” said Tayoga at length.",
        "Presently a slight sound as of long, easy strokes reached them all,\nand in a few moments a line of dark heads appeared through the mists\nand vapors. Then the Mohawks swam to land, carrying their rifles and\nammunition, Daganoweda’s too, on their heads, and stood up in a silent\nand dripping line before their chief.",
        "“It is well,” said Daganoweda, looking them over with an approving\neye. “You are all here, and we fight in the next battle beside our\nwhite brothers.”",
        "“A battle that you would be loath to miss and right glad we are to\nwelcome such sturdy help,” said the voice of Willet behind them. “I’ll\ntell Captain Colden that you’re here.”",
        "The young captain came at once, and welcomed Daganoweda in proper\ndignified fashion. Blankets and food were given to the Mohawks, and\nthey ate and warmed themselves by the fire. They were not many, but\nRobert knew they were a great addition. The fiery spirit of Daganoweda\nalone was worth twenty men.",
        "“I think that we’d better seek sleep now,” said young Lennox to\nGrosvenor. “I admit one is tempted to stay awake that he may see and\nhear everything, but sooner or later you’ve got to rest.”",
        "They found a good place under one of the sheds, and, wrapped in\nblankets, soon sank to slumber. The day after such a momentous night\ncame dark and gloomy, with the rain still dripping. A north wind had\narisen, and high waves chased one another over the lake. There was\nstill much fog on the land side, and, under its cover, the French and\nIndians were stalking the camp, firing at every incautious head.",
        "“Most of those bullets are French,” said Tayoga, “because the warriors\nare not good sharpshooters, and they are aimed well. I think that\nSharp Sword has selected all the best French and Canadian marksmen and\nhas sent them down to the edge of the woods to harass us. As long as\nthe fog hangs there we may expect their bullets.”",
        "The fire of these hidden sharpshooters soon became terribly harassing.\nFrom points of vantage they sent their bullets even into the very\nheart of the camp. Not a head or a shoulder, not an arm could be\nexposed. Three men were killed, a dozen more were wounded, and the\nspirit of the garrison was visibly affected. At the suggestion of\nWillet, Colden selected thirty sharpshooters of his own and sent them\namong the stumps to meet the French and Canadian riflemen.",
        "Robert and Tayoga were in this band, and Willet himself led it.\nDaganoweda and three of his warriors who were good shots also went\nalong. Black Rifle was already outside on one of his usual solitary\nbut fierce man-hunts. All the men as soon as they left the breastworks\nlay almost flat on the wet ground, and crept forward with the utmost\ncare. It was a service of extreme danger, none could be more so, and\nit was certain that not all of them would come back.",
        "When Robert went into the fog and began to creep from stump to stump,\nhis imagination leaped up at once and put a foe at every point in\nfront of him. Perhaps he deserved more credit for courage and daring\nthan any of the others, because his vivid fancy foresaw all the\ndangers and more. Tayoga was on his right and Willet on his left.\nDaganoweda, who had all the eagerness of Black Rifle himself, was\nfarther down the line. Flashes of fire appeared now and then in the\nfog ahead of them, and bullets hummed over their heads.",
        "Robert, essentially humane, began to share, nevertheless, the zeal of\nthese hunters of men around him. The French and Canadians were seeking\ntheir lives and they must strike back. He peered through the fog,\nlooking for a chance to fire, forgetting the wet ground, and the rain\nwhich was fast soaking him through and through. He was concerned only\nto keep his rifle and powder dry. Two flashes on his right showed that\nthe defenders were already replying.",
        "“We cannot go much farther, Dagaeoga,” whispered Tayoga, “or we will\nbe among them. I shall take this stump just ahead.”",
        "“And I the one beside it. I don’t mind admitting that a thick stump\nbetween you and your enemy is a good thing.”",
        "He sank down behind his chosen bulwark, and stared through the fog.\nThe flashes of fire continued, but they were on his right and left,\nand nothing appeared directly in front of him. A cry came from a point\nfarther down the line. One of the defenders had been hit and presently\nanother fell. Robert again saw all the dangers and more, but his mind\nwas in complete command of his body and he watched with unfailing\nvigilance. He saw Willet suddenly level his rifle across his\nprotecting stump and fire. No cry came in response, but he believed\nthat the hunter’s bullet had found its target. Tayoga also pulled\ntrigger, but Robert did not yet see anything at which to aim,\nalthough the sound of shots from the two hostile fronts was now almost\ncontinuous.",
        "The combat in the dim mists had a certain weird quality and Robert’s\nimaginative mind heightened its effect. It was almost like the blind\nshooting at the blind. A pink dot would appear in the fog, expand a\nlittle, and then go out. There would be a sharp report, the whistling\nof a bullet, perhaps, and that was all. The white men fought in\nsilence, and, if there were any Indians with the French and Canadians\nthey imitated them.",
        "Robert, at last, caught a glimpse of a dusky figure about thirty yards\nin front of him, and, aiming his rifle, quickly fired. He had no\nway of knowing that he had hit, save that no shot came in reply, but\nTayoga, who was once again ear to the ground, said that their foes\nwere drawing back a little.",
        "“They find our fire hotter than they had expected,” he said. “If they\ncan shoot in the fog so can we, and the Great Bear is more than a\nmatch for them in such a contest.”",
        "The whole line crept forward and paused again behind another row of\nstumps. A general volley met them and they found protection none too\nsoon. Bullets chipped little pieces off the stumps or struck in the\nground about them. But Robert knew that they had been fired largely\nat random, or had been drawn perhaps by a slight noise. There was a\nstrong temptation to return the fire in a like manner, but he had the\nstrength of mind to withhold his aim for the present, and not shoot\nuntil he had a sure target.",
        "Yet the dim battle in the fog increased in volume. More skirmishers\nfrom the forces of St. Luc came up, and the line of fire spread to\nboth left and right. A yell was heard now and then, and it was\nevident that the Indians in large numbers were coming into the combat.\nWillet’s band was reënforced also from the camp, and his line extended\nto meet that of the foe. Rifles cracked incessantly, the white fog\nwas sprinkled with pink dots, and, above the heads of the men, it was\ndarkened by the smoke that rose from the firing. At rare intervals a\ndeep cheer from a borderer replied to the savage war whoop.",
        "A man four stumps from Robert was hit in the head and died without\na sound, but Willet, firing at the flash of the rifle that slew him,\navenged his loss. A bullet grazed Robert’s head, cutting off two locks\nof hair very neatly. Its passage took his breath for a moment or two,\nand gave him a shock, but he recovered quickly, and, still controlling\nhis impulse to pull trigger in haste, looked for something at which to\naim.",
        "The fog had not lifted at all, but by gazing into its heart a long\ntime, Robert was able to see a little distance. Now and then the\nfigure of an enemy, as he leaped from the shelter of one stump to\nanother, was outlined dimly, but invariably there was not enough time\nfor a shot. Soon he made out a large stump not very far ahead of him,\nand he saw the flash of a rifle from it. He caught a glimpse only of\nthe hands that held the weapon, but he believed them to be a white\nman’s hands and he believed also that the man behind the stump was one\nof the best French sharpshooters.",
        "Robert resolved to bring down the Frenchman, who presently, when\nfiring once more, might then expose enough of himself for a target. He\nwaited patiently and the second shot came. He saw the hands again, the\narms, part of one shoulder and the side of the head, and taking quick\naim he pulled the trigger, though he was satisfied that his bullet had\nmissed.",
        "But the flame of battle was lighted in Robert’s soul. Hating nobody\nand wishing good to all, he nevertheless sought to kill, because some\none was seeking to kill him, and because killing was the business of\nthose about him. What came to be known later as mass psychology took\nhold of him. All his mental and physical powers were concentrated on\nthe single task of slaying an enemy. The affair now resolved itself\ninto a duel between single foes.",
        "Deciding to await a third shot from his enemy, he made his position\nbehind the stump a little easier, poised, as it were, ready to throw\nevery faculty, physical and mental, into his reply to that expected\nthird shot. He was quite sure, too, that he would have a chance,\nbecause the man had exposed so much more of himself at the second\nshot than at the first, and his escape from the bullets would make him\nexpose yet more at the third. His heart began to throb hard, and his\npulses were beating fast. The battle was still going on about him, but\nhe forgot all the rest of it, the shots, the shouts, the flashes, and\nremembered only his own part. He judged that in another minute the man\nwould show himself. So believing, he laid his rifle across his stump,\ncocked it, and was ready to take aim and fire in a few seconds.",
        "His foe’s head appeared, after just about the delay that he had\nexpected, and Robert’s hand sprang to the trigger at the very moment\nthe man pulled his own. The bullet hummed by his cheek. His finger\ncontracted and then it loosened. A sudden acuteness of vision, or a\nchance thinning of the fog at that point, enabled him to see the man’s\nface, and he recognized the French partisan, Charles Langlade, known\nalso to the Indians as the Owl, who, with his wife, the Dove, had once\nheld him in a captivity by no means unkind.",
        "His humane instincts, his gratitude, his feeling for another flared\nup even in that moment of battle and passion, when the man-hunting\nimpulse was so strong. His aim, quick as it was, had been sure and\ndeadly, but, deflecting the muzzle of the rifle a shade, his finger\ncontracted again. The spurt of fire leaped forth and the bullet sang\nby the ear of Langlade, singing to him a little song of caution as it\npassed, telling such a wary partisan as he that his stump was a very\nexposed stump, dangerous to the last degree, and that it would be\nbetter for him to find one somewhere else.",
        "Robert did not see the Owl go away, but he was quite sure that he had\ngone, because it was just the sort of thing that such a skilled forest\nfighter would do. The fog thickened again, and, in a few more minutes,\nboth lines shifted somewhat. Then he had to watch new stumps at new\npoints, and his thoughts were once more in tune with those about him,\nconcentrated on the battle and the man-hunt.",
        "A bullet tipped his ear, and he saw that it came from a stump hardly\nvisible in the fog. The sharpshooter was not likely to be Langlade\nagain, and, at once, it became Robert’s ambition to put him out of\naction. No consideration of mercy or humanity would restrain him now,\nif he obtained a chance of a good shot, and he waited patiently for\nit. Evidently this new sharpshooter had detected his presence also,\nand the second duel was on.",
        "The man fired again in a minute or two, and the bullet chipped very\nclose. He was so quick, too, that Robert did not get an opportunity to\nreturn his fire, but he recognized the face and to his great surprise\nsaw that it was De Courcelles who had taken a place in line with the\nskirmishers. Rage seized him at once. This was the man who had tried\nto trick him to his death in that affair with the bully, Boucher, at\nQuebec. He was shaken with righteous anger. All the kindliness and\nmercy that he had felt toward Langlade disappeared. He was sure, too,\nthat De Courcelles knew him and was trying his best to kill him.",
        "Robert peered over his stump and sought eagerly for a shot. He\ncould play at that game as well as De Courcelles, but his enemy was\ncautious. It was some time before he risked another bullet, and then\nRobert’s, in reply, missed, though he also had been untouched. His\nanger increased. Although he had little hate in his composition he\ncould not forget that this man De Courcelles had been a party to an\ninfamous attempt upon his life, and even now, in what amounted to a\nduel, was seeking to kill him. His own impulses, under such a spur,\nand for the moment, were those of the slayer. He used all the skill\nthat he had learned in the forest to secure an opportunity for the\ntaking of his foe’s life.",
        "Robert sought to draw De Courcelles’ fire again, meanwhile having\nreloaded his own rifle, and he raised his cap a little above the edge\nof the stump. But the trick was too old for the Frenchman and he did\nnot yield to it. Taking the chance, he thrust up his face, dropping\nback immediately as De Courcelles’ bullet sang over his head. Then he\nsprang up and was in time to pull trigger at his enemy, who fell back.",
        "Robert was able to tell in the single glimpse through the fog that De\nCourcelles was not killed. The bullet had struck him in the shoulder,\ninflicting a wound, certainly painful but probably not dangerous,\nalthough it was likely to feed the man’s hate of Robert. Even so,\nyoung Lennox was glad now that he had not killed him, that his death\nwas not upon his hands; it was enough to disable him and to drive him\nout of the battle.",
        "The fighting grew once more in volume and fury. Rifles cracked\ncontinuously up and down the line. The war whoop of the Indians was\nincessant, and the deep cheer of the borderers replied to it. But\nRobert saw that the end of the combat was near; not that the rage of\nman was abated, but because nature, as if tired of so much strife, was\nputting in between a veil that would hide the hostile forces from each\nother. The fog suddenly began to thicken rapidly, rolling up from the\nlake in great, white waves that made figures dim and shadowy, even a\nfew paces away.",
        "If the fighting went on it would be impossible to tell friend from\nfoe, and Willet at once sent forth a sharp call which was repeated up\nand down the line. The French leaders took like action, and, by mutual\nconsent, the two forces fell apart. The firing and the shouts ceased\nabruptly and a slow withdrawal was begun. The fog had conquered.",
        "“Is Dagaeoga hurt?” asked Tayoga.",
        "“Untouched,” replied Robert.",
        "“I saw that you and the Frenchman, De Courcelles, were engaged in a\nbattle of your own. I might have helped you, but if I know you, you\ndid not wish my aid.”",
        "“No, Tayoga. It was man to man. I confess that while our duel was on\nI was filled with rage against him, and tried my best to kill, but now\nI’m glad I gave him only a wound.”",
        "“Your hate flows away as De Courcelles’ blood flows out.”",
        "“If you want to put it that way. But do you hear anything of the\nenemy, Tayoga? Fog seems to be a conductor of sound now and then.”",
        "“Nothing except the light noises of withdrawal. The retreating\nfootsteps become fainter and fainter, and I think we shall have peace\nfor to-day. They might fire bullets at random against the camp, but\nSt. Luc will not let them waste lead in such a manner. No, Dagaeoga,\nwe will lie quiet now and dress our wounds.”",
        "He was right, as the firing was not renewed, though the pickets,\nstationed at short intervals, kept as sharp a watch as they could in\nthe fog, while the others lay by the fires which were now built higher\nthan usual. Colden was hopeful that St. Luc would draw off, but Tayoga\nand Black Rifle, who went out again into the fog, reported no sign of\nit. Beyond a doubt, he was prepared to maintain a long siege.",
        "“We must get help,” said Willet. “We’re supposed to control Lake\nGeorge and we know that forces of ours are at the south end, where\nthey’ve advanced since the taking of Fort William Henry. We’ll have to\nsend messengers.”",
        "“Who are they to be?” asked Colden.",
        "“Robert and Tayoga are most fit. You have plenty of boats. They can\ntake a light one and leave at once, while the fog holds.”",
        "Colden agreed. Young Lennox and the Onondaga were more than willing,\nand, in a half hour, everything was ready for the start. A strong\ncanoe with paddles for two was chosen and they put in it their rifles,\nplenty of ammunition and some food.",
        "“A year from now, if the war is still going on, I’ll be going with you\non such errands,” said Grosvenor confidently.",
        "“Red Coat speaks the truth. He learns fast,” said Tayoga.",
        "“I won’t tell you lads to be careful, because you don’t need any\nadvice,” said Willet.",
        "Many were at the water’s edge, when they pushed off, and Robert knew\nthat they were followed by the best of wishes, not only for their\nsuccess but for themselves also. A few strokes of the paddles and the\nwhole camp, save a luminous glow through the fog, was gone. A few more\nstrokes and the luminous glow too departed. The two were alone once\nmore in the wilderness, and they had little but instinct to guide them\nin their perilous journey upon the waters. But they were not afraid.\nRobert, instead, felt a curious exaltation of the spirit. He was\nsupremely confident that he and Tayoga would carry out their mission,\nin spite of everything.",
        "“It is odd how quickly the camp sank from sight,” he said.",
        "“It is because we are in the heart of a great fog,” said Tayoga.\n\"Since it was thick enough to hide the battle it is thick enough\nalso to hide the camp and us from each other. But, Dagaeoga, it is a\nfriendly fog, as it conceals us from our enemies also.”",
        "“That’s so, Tayoga, but I’m thinking this fog will hold dangers for us\ntoo. St. Luc is not likely to neglect the lake, and he’ll surmise that\nwe’ll send for help. We’ve had experience on the water in fogs before,\nand you’ll have to use your ears as you did then.”",
        "“So I will, Dagaeoga. Suppose we stop now, and listen.”",
        "But nothing of a hostile nature came to them through the mists and\nvapors, and, resuming the paddles again, they bore more toward the\ncenter of the lake, where they thought they would be likely to escape\nthe cruising canoes of the enemy, if any should be sent out by St.\nLuc. They expected too that the fog would thin there, but it did not\ndo so, seeming to spread over the full extent of Andiatarocte.",
        "“How long do you think the fog will last?” asked Robert.",
        "“All day, I fear,” replied Tayoga.",
        "“That’s bad. If any of our friends should be on the shore we won’t be\nable to see ’em.”",
        "“But we have to make the best of it, Dagaeoga. We may be able to hear\nthem.”",
        "The fog was the greatest they had ever seen on Andiatarocte,\nseeming to ooze up from the depths of the waters, and to spread over\neverything. The keenest eyes, like those of Robert and Tayoga, could\npenetrate it only a few yards, and it hung in heavy, wet folds over\ntheir faces. It was difficult even to tell direction and they paddled\nvery slowly in a direction that they surmised led to the south. After\na while they stopped again that Tayoga might establish a new listening\npost upon the water, though nothing alarming yet came to those\nmarvelous ears of his. But it was evident that he expected peril, and\nRobert also anticipated it.",
        "“A force as large as St. Luc’s is sure to have brought canoes\noverland,” said young Lennox, “and in a fog like this he’ll have them\nlaunched on the lake.”",
        "“It is so,” said Tayoga, using his favorite expression, “and I think\nthey will come soon.”",
        "They moved on once more a few hundred yards, and then, when the\nOnondaga listened a long time, he announced that the hostile canoes\nwere on the lake, cruising about in the fog.",
        "“I hear one to the right of us, another to the left, and several\ndirectly ahead,” he said. “Sharp Sword brought plenty of canoes with\nhim and he is using them. I think they have formed a line across the\nlake, surmising that we would send a message to the south. Sharp Sword\nis a great leader, and he forgets nothing.”",
        "“They can’t draw a line that we won’t pass.”",
        "Now they began to use their paddles very slowly and gently, the canoe\nbarely creeping along, and Tayoga listening with all his powers. But\nthe Onondaga was aware that his were not the only keen ears on the\nlake, and that, gentle as was the movement of the paddies that he and\nRobert held, it might be heard.",
        "“The canoe on our right is coming in a little closer to us,” he\nwhispered. “It is a very large canoe, because it holds four paddles.\nI can trace the four separate sounds. They try to soften their strokes\nlest the hidden messenger whom they want to catch may hear them, but\nthey cannot destroy the sound altogether. Now, the one on the left is\nbearing in toward us also. I think they have made a chain across the\nlake, and hope to keep anything from passing.”",
        "“Can you hear those ahead of us?”",
        "“Very slightly, and only now and then, but it is enough to tell us\nthat they are still there. But, Dagaeoga, we must go ahead even if\nthey are before us; we cannot think of turning back.”",
        "“No such thought entered my head, Tayoga. We’ll run this gauntlet.”",
        "“That was what I knew you would say. The canoes from both right and\nleft still approach. I think they carry on a patrol in the fog, and\nmove back and forth, always keeping in touch. Now, we must go forward\na little, or they will be upon us, but be ever so gentle with the\npaddle, Dagaeoga. That is it! We make so little sound that it is no\nsound at all, and they cannot hear us. Now, we are well beyond them,\nand the two canoes are meeting in the fog. The men in them talk\ntogether. You hear them very well yourself, Dagaeoga. Their exact\nwords do not come to our ears, but we know they are telling one\nanother that no messenger from the beleaguered camp has yet passed.\nNow, they part and go back on their beat. We can afford to forget\nthem, Dagaeoga, and think of those ahead. We still have the real\ngauntlet to run. Be very gentle with the paddle again.",
        "“I hear the canoes ahead of us very clearly now. One of them is large\nalso with four paddles in it, and two of the men are Frenchmen. I\ncannot understand what they say, but I hear the French accent; the\nsound is not at all like that the warriors make. One of the Frenchmen\nis giving instructions, as I can tell by his tone of command, and I\nthink the canoes are going to spread out more. Yes, they are moving\naway to both right and left. They must feel sure that we are here\nsomewhere in the fog, trying to get by them, but the big canoe with\nthe Frenchmen in it keeps its place. Bear a little to the left,\nDagaeoga, and we can pass it unseen.”",
        "It was the most delicate of tasks to paddle the canoe, and cause\nscarcely a ripple in the water, but they were so skillful they were\nable to do it, and make no sound that Robert himself could hear.\nAlthough his nerves were steady his excitement was intense. A\nsituation so extraordinary put every power of his imagination into\nplay. His fancy fairly peopled the water with hostile canoes; they\nwere in a triple ring about him and Tayoga. All his pulses were\nbeating hard, yet his will, as usual, was master of his nerves, and\nthe hand that held the paddle never shook.",
        "“A canoe on the outer line, and from the left, is now bearing in\ntoward us,” whispered Tayoga.",
        "“There are two men in it, as the strokes of the paddles show. They are\ncoming toward us. Some evil spirit must have whispered to them that we\nare here. Ah, they have stopped! What does it mean, Dagaeoga? Listen!\nDid you not hear a little splash? They think to surprise us! They keep\nthe paddles silent and try a new trick! Hold the canoe here, Dagaeoga,\nand I will meet the warrior who comes!”",
        "The Onondaga dropped his rifle, hunting shirt and belt with his pistol\nin it, into the bottom of the canoe, and then, his knife in his teeth,\nhe was over the side so quickly that Robert did not have time to\nprotest. In an instant he was gone in the fog, and the youth in\nthe canoe could do nothing but wait, a prey to the most terrible\napprehensions.",
        "Robert, with an occasional motion of the paddle, held the canoe steady\non the water, and tried to pierce the fog with his eyes. He knew that\nhe must stay just where he was, or Tayoga, when he came back, might\nnever find him. If he came back! If–He listened with all his ears for\nsome sound, however slight, that might tell him what was happening.",
        "Out of the fog came a faint splash, and then a sigh that was almost\na groan. Young Lennox shuddered, and the hair on his head stood up a\nlittle. He knew that sound was made by a soul passing, but whose soul?\nOnce more he realized to the full that his lot was cast in wild and\nperilous places.",
        "A swimming face appeared in the fog, close to the canoe, and then his\nheart fell from his throat to its usual place. Tayoga climbed lightly\ninto the canoe, no easy feat in such a situation, put on his belt and\nreplaced the knife in the sheath. Robert asked him nothing, he had\nno need to do so. The sigh that was almost a groan had told the full\ntale.",
        "“Now we will bear to the right again, Dagaeoga,” said Tayoga, calmly,\nas the water dripped from him. Robert shivered once more. His fertile\nfancy reproduced that brief, fierce struggle in the water, but he said\nnothing, promptly following the suggestion of Tayoga, and sending the\ncanoe to the right. The position was too perilous, though, for them\nto continue on one course long, and at the end of forty or fifty yards\nthey stopped, both listening intently.",
        "“Some of them are talking with one another now,” whispered Tayoga.\n\"The warrior who swam does not come back to his canoe, and they wonder\nwhy he stays in the water so long. Soon they will know that he is\nnever coming out of the water. Now I hear a voice raised somewhat\nabove the others. It is a French voice. It is not that of St. Luc,\nbecause he must remain on shore to direct his army. It is not that of\nDe Courcelles, because you wounded him, and he must be lying in camp\nnursing his hurts. So I conclude that it is Jumonville, who is next\nin rank and who therefore would be likely to command on this important\nservice. I am sure it is Jumonville, and his raised voice indicates\nthat he is giving orders. He realizes that the swimmer will not\nreturn and that we must be near. Perhaps he knows or guesses that the\nmessengers are you and I, because he has learned long since that we\nare fitted for just such service, and that we have done such deeds.\nFor instance, our journey to Quebec, on which we first met him.”",
        "“Then he’ll think Dave is here too, because he was with us then.”",
        "“No, he will be quite sure the Great Bear is not here. He knows that\nhe is too important in the defense of the camp, that, while Captain\nColden commands, it is the Great Bear who suggests and really directs\neverything. His sharp orders signify some sudden, new plan. They have\na fleet of canoes, and I think they are making a chain, with the links\nconnected so closely that we cannot pass. It is a real gauntlet for us\nto run, Dagaeoga.”",
        "“And how are we to run it?”",
        "“We must pass as warriors, as men of their own.”",
        "“I do not look like a warrior.”",
        "“But you can make yourself look like one, in the fog at least, enough,\nperhaps, to go by. Your hair is a little long; take off your hunting\nshirt, and the other shirt beneath it, bare yourself to the waist, and\nin such a fog as this it would take the keenest of eyes, only a few\nyards away, to tell that you are white. Quick, Dagaeoga! Lay the\ngarments on the bottom of the canoe. Bend well upon your paddle and\nappear to be searching the water everywhere for the messengers who try\nto escape. I will do the same. Ah, that is well. You look and act so\nmuch like a warrior of the woods, Dagaeoga, that even I, in the same\ncanoe, could well take you for a Huron. Now we will whisper no more\nfor a while, because they come, and they will soon be upon us.”",
        "Robert bent over his paddle. His upper clothing lay in the bottom of\nthe canoe, with his rifle and Tayoga’s upon the garments, ready to be\nsnatched up in an instant, if need should come. The cold, wet fog beat\nupon his bare shoulders and chest, but he did not feel it. Instead his\nblood was hot in every vein, and the great pulses in his temples beat\nso hard that they made a roaring in his ears.",
        "Distinct sounds now came from both left and right, the swish of\npaddles, the ripple of water against the side of a canoe, men talking.\nThey were coming to the chain that had been stretched in front of\nthem, and their fate would soon be decided. Now, they must be not only\nbrave to the uttermost, but they must be consummate actors too.",
        "Figures began to form themselves in the fog, the outline of a canoe\nwith two men in it appeared on their right, another showed just ahead,\nand two more on the left. Robert from his lowered eyes, bent over the\npaddle, caught a glimpse of the one ahead, a great canoe, or rather\nboat, containing five men, one of whom wielded no paddle, but who sat\nin its center, issuing orders. Through the fog came a slight gleam\nof metal from his epaulets and belt, and, although the face was\nindistinct, Robert knew that it was Jumonville.",
        "The officer was telling the canoes to keep close watch, not to let\nthe chain be broken, that the messengers were close at hand, that\nthey would soon be taken, and that their comrade who did not come\nback would be avenged. Robert bent a little lower over his paddle. His\nwhole body prickled, and the roaring in his ears increased.",
        "Tayoga suddenly struck him a smart blow across his bowed back,\nand spoke to him fiercely in harsh, guttural Huron. Robert did not\nunderstand the words, but they sounded like a stern rebuke for poor\nwork with the paddle. The blow and the words stimulated him, keyed him\nto a supreme effort as an actor. All his histrionic temperament flared\nup at once. He made a poor stroke with the paddle, threw up much\nsurplus water, and, as he cowered away from Tayoga, he corrected\nhimself hastily. Tayoga uttered a sharp rebuke again, but did not\nstrike a second time. That would have been too much. Robert’s next\nstroke was fine and sweeping, and he heard Jumonville say in French\nwhich many of the Indians understood:",
        "“Go more toward the center of the lake and take a place in the line.”",
        "Tayoga and Robert obeyed dumbly, passing Jumonville’s boat at a range\nof five or six yards, going a little beyond the line, and, turning\nabout as if to make a curve that would keep them from striking any\nother canoe. Again Robert made a false stroke with the paddle, causing\nthe canoe to rock dangerously, and now, Tayoga, fully justified by\nthe fierce code of the forest in striking him again, snatched his own\npaddle out of the water and gave him a smart rap with the flat of it\nacross the back, at the same time upbraiding him fiercely in Huron.",
        "“Dolt! Fool!” he exclaimed. “Will you never learn how to hold your\npaddle? Will you never know the stroke? Will you tip us both into the\nwater at such a time, when the messengers of the enemy are seeking\nto steal through? Do better with the paddle or you shall stay at home\nwith the old women, and work for the warriors!”",
        "Robert snarled in reply, but he did not repay the blow. He made\nanother awkward sweep that sent them farther on the outward curve, and\nhe heard Jumonville’s harsh laugh. He was still the superb actor. His\nexcitement was real, and he counterfeited a nervousness and jerkiness\nthat appeared real also. One more wild stroke, and they shot farther\nout. Jumonville angrily ordered them to return, but Robert seemed to\nbe possessed by a spell of awkwardness, and Tayoga craftily aided him.",
        "“Come back!” roared Jumonville.",
        "Robert and Tayoga were fifteen yards away, and the great blanket of\nfog was enclosing them.",
        "“Now! Now, Dagaeoga!” whispered the Onondaga tensely. “We paddle with\nall our might straight toward the south!”",
        "Two paddles wielded by skillful and powerful arms flashed in the\nwater, and the canoe sped on its way. A shout of anger rose behind\nthem, and Robert distinctly heard Jumonville say in French:",
        "“After them! After them! It was the messengers who stole by! They have\ntricked us!”",
        "Those words were sweet in the ears of young Lennox. He had played the\nactor, and the reward, the saving of their lives, had been paid. It\nwas one of their greatest triumphs and the savor of it would endure\nlong. The very thought gave fresh power to his arm and back, and he\nswept his paddle with a strength that he had never known before. The\ncanoe skimmed the water like a bird and fairly flew in their chosen\ncourse.",
        "Robert’s own faculties became marvelously acute. He heard behind them\nthe repeated and angry orders of Jumonville, the hurried strokes of\nmany paddles, the splashing of canoes turned quickly about, a hum\nof excited voices, and then he felt a great swell of confidence. The\nroaring in his ears was gone, his nerves became amazingly steady, and\nevery stroke with his paddle was long and finished, a work of art.",
        "Four or five minutes of such toil, and Tayoga rested on his paddle.\nRobert imitated him.",
        "“Now we will take our ease and listen,” said the Onondaga. “The fog\nis still our friend, and they will think we have turned to one side in\nit, because that is the natural thing to do. But you and I, Dagaeoga,\nwill not turn just yet.”",
        "“I can’t hear anything, Tayoga, can you?”",
        "“I cannot, Dagaeoga, but we will not have long to wait. Now, I catch\nthe light swish of a paddle. They are feeling about in the fog. There\ngoes another paddle–and more. They come closer, but we still bide\nhere a little. I hear the voice of Jumonville. He is very angry. But\nwhy should he be more angry at any other than at himself? He saw us\nwith his own eyes. He shouts many sharp orders, and some of them are\nfoolish. They must be so, because no man could shout orders so fast,\nand in such a confused way, and have them all good. He sends more\ncanoes to both right and left to seek us. You and I can afford to\nlaugh, Dagaeoga.”",
        "Sitting at rest in their canoe they laughed. With Robert it was not so\nmuch a laugh of amusement as a laugh of relief after such tremendous\ntension. He felt that they were now sure to escape, and with Tayoga he\nwaited calmly.",
        "The spirits of young Lennox rose to the zenith. Although they were\nstill grazing the edge of peril, he had supreme confidence in Tayoga\nand also in the fog. It was a great fog, a thick fog, a kindly fog,\nand it had made possible their escape and the achievement of their\nmission. Having held so long it would hold until they needed it no\nlonger.",
        "“Have they come any nearer, Tayoga?” he asked.",
        "“Jumonville is still giving orders, and sending the canoes somewhat at\nrandom. He is not the leader Sharp Sword would be in an emergency, nor\nanything like it. He is having his own boat paddled about uncertainly.\nI can hear the paddles of the four men in it. Now and then he speaks\nangrily, too. He is upbraiding those who are not to blame. How are\nyou feeling now, Dagaeoga? Has Manitou already filled you with new\nstrength?”",
        "“I’m feeling as well as I ever did in my life. I’m ready to swing the\npaddle again.”",
        "“Then we go. The fog will not wait for us forever. We must use it\nwhile we have it.”",
        "They swept their paddles through the water in long and vigorous\nstrokes, and the canoe shot forward once more. They were confident now\nthat no enemy was ahead of them, and that none of those behind could\novertake them. The wet, cold fog still enclosed them like a heavy,\ndamp blanket, but their vigorous exercise and their high spirits kept\nthem warm. After ten minutes they made another stop, but as Tayoga\ncould hear nothing of Jumonville’s party they pushed on again at\nspeed. By and by the Onondaga said:",
        "“I feel the fog thinning, Dagaeoga. A wind out of the west has risen,\nand soon it will take it all away.”",
        "“But it has served its purpose. I shall always feel well toward fogs.\nYes, here it goes! The wind is rising fast, and it is taking away the\nmists and vapors in great folds.”",
        "The water began to roughen under the stiff breeze. The fog was split\nasunder, the pieces were torn to fragments and shreds, and then\neverything was swept away, leaving the surface of the lake a silver\nmirror, and the mountains high and green on either shore. Far behind\nthem hovered the Indian canoes, and four or five miles ahead a tower\nof smoke rose from the west bank.",
        "“Certainly our people,” said Robert, looking at the smoke.",
        "“There is no doubt of it,” said the Onondaga, “and that is where we\nwill go.”",
        "“And those behind us know now that we tricked them in the fog and have\nescaped. They give forth a shout of anger and disappointment. Now they\nturn back.”",
        "They eased their strokes a little as the pursuit had been abandoned,\nbut curved more toward the center of the lake, lest some hidden\nsharpshooter on shore might reach them, and made fair speed toward the\nsmoke, which Robert surmised might be made by a vanguard of troops.",
        "“We ought to have help for Colden and Willet very soon,” he said.",
        "“It will not be long,” said Tayoga; “but Dagaeoga has forgotten\nsomething. Can he not think what it is?”",
        "“No, Tayoga, I can’t recall anything.”",
        "“Dagaeoga’s body is bare from the waist up. It is well for an Indian\nto go thus into a white camp, but it is not the custom of the people\nto whom Lennox belongs.”",
        "“You’re right. I’ve had so much excitement that I’d forgotten all\nabout my clothes. I must be true to my race, when I meet my brethren.”",
        "He reclothed himself, resumed his paddle, and they pushed on steadily\nfor the smoke. No trace of the fog was left. The lake glistened in\nthe sun, the ranges showed green from base to summit, and the tower of\nsmoke deepened and broadened.",
        "“Can you make out what lies at the foot of it, Tayoga?” asked Robert.",
        "“I think I can see a gleam of the sun on an epaulet. It is certainly\na camp of your people. The lake is supposed to be under their command,\nand if the French should make a new incursion here upon its shores\nthey would not build their fires so boldly. Now, I see another gleam,\nand I hear the ring of axes. They are not boat builders, because no\nboats, either finished or unfinished, show at the water’s edge. They\nare probably cutting wood for their fires. I hear, too, the crack of\na whip, which means that they have wagons, and the presence of wagons\nindicates a large force. They may be coming ahead with supplies for\nour great army when it advances. I can now see men in uniform, and\nthere are some red coats among them. Hold your paddle as high as you\ncan, Dagaeoga, as a sign that we are friends, and I will send the\ncanoe in toward the shore. Ah, they see us now, and men are coming\ndown to the lake’s edge to meet us! It is a large camp, and it should\nhold enough men to make St. Luc give up the siege of Colden.”",
        "The two sent the canoe swiftly toward the land, where soldiers and\nothers in hunter’s dress were already gathered to meet them. Robert\nsaw a tall, thin officer in a Colonial uniform, standing on the narrow\nbeach, and, assuming him to be in command, he said as the canoe swept\nin:",
        "“We are messengers, sir, from the force of Captain Colden, which is\nbesieged at the sawmill ten or twelve miles farther north.”",
        "“Besieged, did you say?” said the officer, speaking in a sharp, dry\nvoice. “It’s one of those French tricks they’re always playing on us,\nrushing in under our very noses, and trying to cut out our forces.”",
        "“That’s it, sir. The French and Indian host, in this case, is led\nby St. Luc, the ablest and most daring of all their partisans, and,\nunless you give help, they’ll have to escape as best they can in what\nboats they have.”",
        "“As I’m a good Massachusetts man, I expected something of this kind. I\nsent word to Pownall, our Governor, that we must be extremely\ncautious in respect to the French, but he thinks the army of General\nAbercrombie will overwhelm everything. Forest fighting is very\ndifferent from that of the open fields, a fact which the French seem\nto have mastered better than we have. My name, young sir, is Elihu\nStrong. I’m a colonel of the Massachusetts militia, and I command the\nforce that you see posted here.”",
        "“And mine, sir, is Robert Lennox, a free lance, and this is Tayoga, of\nthe clan of the Bear, of the great Onondaga nation, a devoted friend\nof ours and the finest trailer the world has ever produced.”",
        "“Ah, I heard something of you both when I was at Albany from one\nJacobus Huysman, a stout and worthy burgher, who spoke well of you,\nand who hazarded a surmise that I might meet you somewhere in the\nneighborhood of the lakes.”",
        "“We lived in the house of Mynheer Jacobus when we went to school in\nAlbany. We owe him much.”",
        "“There was a third who was generally with you, a famous hunter, David\nWillet, was there not?”",
        "“He is with Captain Colden, sir, assisting in the defense.”",
        "“I’m glad he’s there. Judging from what I’ve heard of him, he’s a\ntower of strength. But come into the camp. Doubtless, both of you\nneed food and rest. The times be dark, and we must get out of each day\nwhatever it has to offer.”",
        "Robert looked at him with interest. He was the forerunner of a type\nthat was to develop markedly in New England, tall, thin, dry-lipped,\ncritical, shrewd and tenacious to the last degree. He and his kind\nwere destined to make a great impress upon the New World. He gave to\nthe two the best the camp had, and ordered that they be treated with\nevery courtesy.",
        "“I’ve a strong force here,” he said, “although it might have been\nstronger if our Governor and Legislature had done their full duty.\nStill, we must make the best of everything. My men reported Indians in\nthe forest to the north of us, and that, perhaps, is the reason why we\nhave not come into contact with Captain Colden, but I did not suspect\nthat he was besieged.”",
        "Robert, as he ate the good food set before him, looked over the camp,\nwhich had been pitched well, with far-flung pickets to guard against\nambush, and his eyes glistened, as they fell upon two brass cannon,\nstanding side by side upon a slight rise in the center of the camp.\nThe big guns, when well handled, were always effective against forest\nwarriors. Colonel Strong’s eyes followed his.",
        "“I see that you are taking notice of my cannon,” he said. “They’re\ngood pieces, but if our governor and legislature had done their duty\nthey’d be four instead of two. Still, we have to make the best of what\nwe have. I told Shirley that we must prepare for a great war, and I\ntell Pownall the same. Those who don’t know him always underrate our\nFrench foe.”",
        "“I never do, sir,” said Robert. “I’ve seen too much of him to do\nthat.”",
        "“Well, well, we’ll do the best we can. I’ve four hundred men here,\nthough if the Governor and the Legislature of Massachusetts had done\ntheir full duty they’d be eight hundred, not to say a thousand. I’ll\nadvance as soon as possible to the relief of Colden. He can surely\nhold out until the morrow.”",
        "“Not a doubt of it, sir, and, if you’ll pardon me for making a\nsuggestion, I wouldn’t begin any advance until the morning. Not much\nof the day is left. If we started this afternoon, night would overtake\nus in the woods and the Chevalier de St. Luc is sure to plant an\nambush for us.”",
        "“Sensibly spoken, young sir. We’re an eternally rash people. We’re\nalways walking into traps. I’ve in my force about twenty good scouts,\nthough if the Governor and Legislature of Massachusetts had done their\nfull duty they’d be forty, not to say fifty, and I don’t want to risk\ntheir loss in night fighting in the forest.”",
        "He went away and Robert saw him moving among his men, giving orders.\nElihu Strong, a merchant, nevertheless had made himself a strenuous\nsoldier at his province’s call, and he was not unwilling to learn even\nfrom those not more than half his age.",
        "“Open Eyes will do well,” said Tayoga.",
        "“Open Eyes?”",
        "“Aye, Dagaeoga. The colonel who is named Strong I will call Open Eyes,\nbecause he is willing to look and see. He will look when you tell\nhim to look, and many who come from the cities will not do that. And\nbecause his eyes are open he will not stick his head into an ambush.\nYet he will always complain of others.”",
        "“And sometimes of himself, too,” laughed Robert. “I think he’ll be\nfair in that respect. Now, Tayoga, we’ll rest here, and be easy with\nourselves until to-morrow morning, when we advance.”",
        "“We will stay, Dagaeoga, but I do not know whether it will be so easy.\nSince Jumonville saw us escape he will tell St. Luc of it, and Sharp\nSword will send a force here to harry Open Eyes, and to make him think\nthe forest is full of warriors. But Open Eyes, though he may complain,\nwill not be afraid.”",
        "It was even as the Onondaga predicted. The foe came with the twilight.\nThe dark wilderness about them gave back whoops and yells, and furtive\nbands skirmished with Strong’s scouts. Then the shouts of the warriors\nincreased greatly in number, and seemed to come from all points about\nthe camp. It was obvious to Robert that the enemy was trying to make\nStrong’s men believe that a great force was confronting them, and some\nof them, unused to the woods, showed apprehension lest such an unseen\nand elusive danger overwhelm them. But Elihu Strong never flinched.\nThe forest was almost as much of a mystery to him as it was to his\ntroops, but he was there to dare its perils and he dared them.",
        "“I shall keep my men in camp and await attack, if they make it,” he\nsaid to Robert, to whom he seemed to have taken a great fancy, “and\nwhatever happens I shall move forward in the morning to the relief of\nColden.”",
        "He shut his thin lips tightly together and his pale blue eyes flashed.\nThe merchant, turned soldier, had the stoutest of hearts, and a stout\nheart was what was needed in his camp that night. The warriors gave\nhis men no rest. They circled about continually, firing and whooping,\nand trying to create panic, or at least a fear that would hold Strong\nwhere he was.",
        "Robert went to sleep early, and, when he awakened far in the night,\nthe turmoil was still going on. But he saw Elihu Strong walking back\nand forth near one of the fires, and in the glow his thin face still\nreflected an iron resolution. Satisfied that the camp was in no danger\nof being frightened, young Lennox went back to sleep.",
        "A gray, chilly morning came, and soon after dawn Elihu Strong began\nto prepare his men for their perilous progress, serving first an ample\nhot breakfast with plenty of tea and coffee.",
        "“Open Eyes not only watches but he knows much,” said Tayoga. “He has\nlearned that an army marches better on a full stomach.”",
        "Strong then asked Robert and Tayoga to serve in a way as guides, and\nhe made his dispositions, sending his scouts in advance, putting his\nmost experienced soldiers on the flanks and heading his main column\nwith the two brass cannon. The strictest injunctions that nobody\nstraggle were given, and then the force took up its march.",
        "They had not been molested while at breakfast, and when making the\npreparations, but as soon as they left the fire and entered the\ndeep forest, the terrifying turmoil burst forth again, fierce whoops\nresounding on every side and bullets pattering on the leaves or bark.\nColonel Strong left his scouts and flankers to deal with the ambushed\nwarriors, and the main column, face to the front, marched steadily\ntoward Colden’s camp. It was to be a trial of nerves, and Robert was\nquite confident that the stern New England leader would win.",
        "“The savages make a tremendous tumult,” he said to young Lennox, “but\ntheir bullets are not reaching us. We’re not to be shaken by mere\nnoise.”",
        "“When they find that out, as they soon will,” said Robert, “they’ll\nmake an attack. Some French officers and troops must be with them.\nPerhaps Jumonville came in the night to lead them.”",
        "He and Tayoga then went a short distance into the forest ahead of the\nscouts, and Tayoga saw ample evidence that the French were present\nwith the Indians.",
        "“You are right in your surmise that Jumonville came in the night,” he\nsaid. “He wore boots, and here are the imprints of his heels. I think\nhe is not far away now. Watch well, Dagaeoga, while I lie on the earth\nand listen.”",
        "Ear to the ground, the Onondaga announced that he could hear men on\nboth sides of them moving.",
        "“There is the light step of the warriors,” he said, “and also the\nheavier tread of the French. I think I can hear Jumonville himself. It\nsounds like the crush of boots. Perhaps they are now seeking to lay an\nambush.”",
        "“Then it’s time for us to fall back, Tayoga, both for our own sakes\nand for the sake of Colonel Strong’s force.”",
        "The two retreated quickly lest they be caught in an ambush, and gave\nwarning to Elihu Strong that an attack was now probable, a belief\nin which they were confirmed by the report the scouts brought in\npresently that a creek was just ahead, a crossing always being a\nfavorite place for an Indian trap.",
        "“So be it,” said Colonel Strong, calmly. “We are ready. If the\nGovernor and Legislature of Massachusetts had done their full duty,\nwe’d be twice as strong, but even as we are we’ll force the passage of\nthe creek.”",
        "“You will find a body of the warriors on this side of the stream,\"\nsaid Tayoga. “They will give way after a little firing, tempting you\nto think you have won an easy victory. Then when about half of your\nmen are across they will attack with all their might, hoping to cut\nyou down.”",
        "“I thank you for telling me,” said Colonel Strong. “I’ve no doubt you\nknow what you’re talking about. Your manner indicates it. We might be\nmuch better equipped than we are if those in authority in my province\nhad done their full duty, but we will make way, nevertheless. I’ll\ncover the passage of the creek with the guns.”",
        "The firing in front already showed that Tayoga’s prediction was coming\ntrue, and it was accompanied by a tremendous volume of yelling, as if\nthe whole Indian force were gathered on the near side of the creek.",
        "Robert from the crest of a hill saw the stream, narrow and deep,\nthough not too deep for fording as he was to learn later, fringed on\neither side with a dense growth of low bushes, from the shelter of\nwhich warriors were sending their bullets toward the white force. The\nmen were eager to go against them at once, but the scouts were sent\nforward through the undergrowth to open up a flanking fire, and then\nthe main column marched on at a steady pace.",
        "The crash of the rifles grew fast. The warriors on the near side of\nthe creek leaped from the bushes as Strong’s men drew near, waded the\nstream and disappeared in the forest on the other bank, giving forth\nhowls of disappointment as they fled. The soldiers, uttering a\nshout of triumph, undertook to rush forward in pursuit, but Strong\nrestrained them.",
        "“It’s the ambush against which the Onondaga warned us,” he said to his\nlieutenants, “and we won’t run into it. Bring forward the cannon.”",
        "The two brass guns, fine twelve pounders, were moved up within close\nrange of the creek, and they swept the forest on the other side with\nballs and grape shot. It was probably the first time cannon were ever\nheard in those woods, and the reports came back in many echoes. Boughs\nand twigs rained down.",
        "“It is a great sound,” said Tayoga admiringly, “and the warriors who\nare trying to plant an ambush will not like it.”",
        "“But you’ll remember Braddock’s fate,” said Robert. “The cannon didn’t\ndo much then.”",
        "“But this is different, Dagaeoga. Open Eyes has his eyes open. He\nis merely using the cannon as a cover for his advance. They will be\nbacked up by the rifles. You will see.”",
        "The soldiers approached the creek cautiously, and, when the first\nranks were in the water, the cannon raked the woods ahead to right and\nleft, and to left and right. The best of the riflemen were also pushed\nforward, and, when the warriors opened fire, they were quickly driven\naway. Then the whole force, carrying the cannon with them, crossed,\nand stood in triumph on the other side.",
        "“Did I not tell you that Open Eyes knew what he was doing?” said\nTayoga.",
        "“It seems that he does,” Robert replied, “but we haven’t yet arrived\nat Colden’s station. An attack in force is sure to come.”",
        "“Dagaeoga speaks truth. I think it will occur a mile or two farther\non. They will make it before Captain Colden’s men can learn that we\nare on the march.”",
        "“Then they won’t wait long. Anywhere will do, as the forest is dense\neverywhere.”",
        "Since they had carried the ford with but little loss, the cannon\nthat had blazed the way ceased to fire, but the gunners regarded them\nproudly and Robert did not withhold admiration. They were pioneers,\nfine brass creatures, and when handled right they were a wonderful\nhelp in the forest. He did not blame the gunners for patting the\nbarrels, for scraping the mud of the creek’s crossing from the wheels,\nand for speaking to them affectionately. Massive and polished they\ngleamed in the sun and inspired confidence.",
        "Tayoga went ahead in the forest, but came back soon and reported a\nlow ridge not more than half a mile farther on, a likely place for\nan attack, which he judged would come there. It would be made by the\nunited force of the French and Indians and would be severe.",
        "“So be it,” said Elihu Strong, whose iron calm nothing disturbed. “We\nare ready for the foe, though St. Luc himself should come. It is true\nthat instead of two cannon we might have had four or even six, or\ntwice as many men, if the Governor and Legislature of Massachusetts\nhad done their full duty, but we’ll let that pass. Will you, Lennox,\nand you, Tayoga, advance with the scouts and be my eyes?”",
        "Robert appreciated the compliment to the full, and promptly replied in\nthe affirmative for them both. Then he and Tayoga at once plunged\ninto the forest with the borderers who were there to provide against\nambush, all of them approaching the menacing ridge with great care. It\nwas a long projection, rising about a hundred feet, and grown densely\nwith trees and bushes. It looked very quiet and peaceful and birds\neven were singing there among the boughs. The leader of the scouts, a\nbronzed man of middle age named Adams, turned to Tayoga.",
        "“I see nothing there,” he said, “but I’ve heard of you and your power\nto find things where others can’t. Do you think they’re on that ridge\nwaiting for us?”",
        "“It is certain,” replied the Onondaga. “It is the place best fitted\nfor them, and they will not neglect it. Let me go forward a little,\nwith my friend, Dagaeoga, and we will unveil them.”",
        "“We’ll wait here, and if they’re on it I believe you’ll soon know it,\"\nsaid Adams confidently.",
        "Tayoga slid forward among the bushes and Robert followed. Neither made\nthe slightest noise, and they drew much nearer to the ridge, which\nstill basked in the sun, peaceful and innocent in looks. Not a warrior\nor a Frenchman appeared there, the bushes gave back no glint of\nweapons, nothing was disclosed.",
        "“They may be hidden in that jungle, but they won’t stir until we’re\nunder the muzzles of their rifles. What do you propose to do?” asked\nRobert.",
        "“I will tempt them, Dagaeoga.”",
        "“Tempt them? I don’t understand you.”",
        "“Tododaho on his great star which we cannot see in the day, but which,\nnevertheless, is there, whispers to me that Tandakora himself is among\nthe bushes on the ridge. It is just such an ambush as he loves. As you\nknow, Dagaeoga, he hates us all, but he hates me most. If he sees a\ngood opportunity for a shot at me he will not be able to forego it.”",
        "“For Heaven’s sake, Tayoga, don’t make a martyr of yourself merely to\ndraw the enemy’s fire!”",
        "“No such thought was in my mind. I am not yet ready to leave the\nworld, which I find bright and full of interest. Moreover, I wish to\nsee the end of this war and what will happen afterward. Risks are a\npart of our life, Dagaeoga, but I will take none that is undue.”",
        "Tayoga spoke in his usual precise, book English, explaining everything\nfully, and Robert said nothing more. But he awaited the actions of the\nOnondaga with intense interest. Tayoga crept forward five or six yards\nmore, and then he stumbled, striking against a bush and shaking it\nviolently. Robert was amazed. It was incredible that the Onondaga\nshould be so awkward, and then he remembered. Tayoga was going to draw\nthe enemy’s fire.",
        "Tayoga struck against another bush, and then stood upright and\nvisible. Those hidden on the ridge, if such there were, could see him\nclearly. The response was immediate. A gigantic figure stood up among\nthe bushes, leveled a rifle and fired at him point blank. But the\nOnondaga, quick as lightning, dropped back and the bullet whistled\nover his head. Robert fired at the great painted figure of Tandakora,\nbut he too missed, and in a moment the Ojibway chief sank down in the\nundergrowth. A shout came from the hidden Indians about him.",
        "“They are there,” said Tayoga, “and we know just where many of them\nlie. We will suggest to Open Eyes that he fire the cannon at that\npoint.”",
        "They rejoined Adams.",
        "“You were right, as I knew you’d be,” said the scout. “You’ve located\n’em.”",
        "“Yes, because Tandakora could not resist his hate of me,” said the\nOnondaga.",
        "They withdrew to the main force, and once more the brave brass guns\nwere brought up, sending solid shot and grape into the bushes on the\nridge, then moving forward and repeating the fire. Many rifles opened\nupon them from the thickets, and several men fell, but Elihu Strong\nheld his people in hand, and the scouts drove back the sharpshooters.\nMeanwhile the whole force advanced and began to climb the ridge, the\ncannon being turned on the flanks, where the attack was now heaviest.\nA fierce battle ensued, and the guns, served with great skill and\neffectiveness, kept the Indians at bay. More of Strong’s men were\nslain and many were hit, but their own rifles backed up the guns with\na deadly fire. Thus the combat was waged in the thickets a full two\nhours, when they heard a great shout toward the north, and Willet, at\nthe head of a hundred men, broke his way through to their relief. Then\nFrench and Indians drew off, and the united forces proceeded to the\npoint, where Colden, Wilton, Carson and Grosvenor gave them a great\nwelcome.",
        "“We are here,” said Elihu Strong. “If the Governor and Legislature of\nMassachusetts had done their full duty we might have been here sooner,\nbut here we are.”",
        "“I knew that you would come back and bring help with you,” said\nGrosvenor to Robert. “I felt sure that Tayoga would guide the canoe\nthrough every peril.”",
        "“Your confidence was not misplaced,” said Robert. “He did some\nwonderful work. He was as great a trailer on the water as he is on\nland. Now that we are so much stronger, I wonder what St. Luc is going\nto do.”",
        "But Black Rifle came in the next morning with the news that the\nChevalier and his whole force were gone.",
        "They had stolen away silently in the night, and were now marching\nnorthward, probably to join Montcalm.",
        "“I’m not surprised,” said Willet. “We’re now too strong for him\nand St. Luc is not the man to waste his time and strength in vain\nendeavors. I suspect that we will next hear of him near Champlain,\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of Ticonderoga. I think we’d better\nfollow his trail a little distance.”",
        "Willet himself led the band that pursued St. Luc, and it included\nTayoga, Robert, Grosvenor, Black Rifle and Adams, Daganoweda and his\nMohawks having left shortly before on an expedition of their own. It\nwas an easy enough task, as the trail necessarily was wide and deep,\nand the Onondaga could read it almost with his eyes shut.",
        "“Here went Sharp Sword,” he said after looking about a while. “I find\ntraces of his moccasins, which I would know anywhere because I have\nseen them so many times before. Here another Frenchman joined him and\nwalked beside him for a while. It was Jumonville, whose imprints I\nalso know. They talked together. Perhaps Jumonville was narrating the\ndetails of his encounter with us. Now he leaves St. Luc, who is joined\nby another Frenchman wearing moccasins. But the man is heavy and\nwalked with a heavy step. It is the Canadian, Dubois, who attends upon\nSharp Sword, and who is devoted to him. Perhaps Sharp Sword is giving\nhim instructions about the camp that they will make when the day\nis over. Now Dubois also goes, and here come the great moccasins of\nTandakora. I have seen none other so large in the woods, and a child\nwould know them. He too talks with Sharp Sword, but Sharp Sword does\nnot stop for him. They walk on together, because the stride continues\nsteady and even, just the length that a man of Sharp Sword’s height\nwould make when walking. Tandakora is very angry, not at Sharp\nSword–he would not dare to show anger against him–but at the will\nof Manitou who would not let him win a victory over us. He did not get\nmuch satisfaction from Sharp Sword, because he stayed with him only a\nvery short time. Here his trail leads away again, and Sharp Sword once\nmore walks on alone.",
        "“Perhaps Sharp Sword prefers to be alone. Most men do after a\ndisappointment, and he knows that his attack upon the boat builders\nhas been a failure. Sharp Sword does not like failures any more than\nother people do, and he wants to think. He is planning how to win\na great success, and to atone for his failure here. I do not see\nanything of De Courcelles. I do not find his trail anywhere, which\nshows that the wound you gave him, Dagaeoga, was severe. He is being\ncarried either by warriors or French soldiers on a litter. It is far\nmore likely to be soldiers, and here I find them, the trail of four\nmen who walk exactly even, two by two all the time. The rage of De\nCourcelles will mount very high against you, Dagaeoga, and you will\nhave to beware of him.”",
        "“I am ready for him,” said Robert, proudly.",
        "The broad trail led steadily on toward the north, but Willet, after a\nwhile, spread out his own little force, taking no chances with forest\nambush. He considered it highly probable that before long Tandakora\nwould curve aside with some of his warriors, hoping to trap the\nunwary. He was confirmed in his opinion by the Onondaga’s reading of\nthe trail.",
        "“I find the footprints of the Ojibway chief again,” said Tayoga. “Here\nthey go at the edge of the trail. Now he has stopped. His stride\nhas ceased, and he stands with his moccasins close together. He is\nprobably talking with his warriors and he meditates something. The\nrage of Tandakora is as great as that of De Courcelles, but Tandakora\nis not hurt, and he is able to strike. He moves on again, and, ah!\nhere he goes into the woods. Beyond question he is now engaged in\nplanting an ambush for those who would follow St. Luc. Shall we go\nback, Great Bear, or shall we meet the Ojibway’s ambush with an ambush\nof our own?”",
        "The black eyes of the Onondaga sparkled.",
        "“We ought to turn back,” replied Willet, “but I can’t resist playing\nTandakora’s own game with him. It may give us a chance to rid the\nborder of that scourge. We’ll leave the trail, and go into the deep\nbush.”",
        "Led by the hunter the little band plunged into the forest and began\na careful circle, intending to come back to the trail some distance\nahead, and to post themselves behind Tandakora in case that wily\nsavage was planning an ambush, as they felt sure he was. They\nredoubled their precautions, ceasing all talk for the while, and\nallowing no bushes to rustle as they passed. Willet led the line, and\nTayoga brought up the rear. Grosvenor was just behind Robert. He, too,\nwas now able to bring down his feet in soundless fashion, and to avoid\nevery stick or twig that might break with a crack beneath his weight.\nWhile he was aware of the perils before them, his heart beat high. He\nfelt that he was making further progress, and that he was becoming a\nworthy forest runner.",
        "After two careful hours of travel, they came back again to the broad\ntrail which showed that St. Luc was still maintaining steady progress\ntoward the north. But both the hunter and the Onondaga felt sure that\nTandakora and a chosen band were now to the south, waiting in ambush\nfor those who would come in pursuit.",
        "“We’d better draw ’em if we can,” said Willet. “Let ’em know we’re\nhere, but make ’em believe we’re friends.”",
        "“I think I can do it,” said Tayoga. “I know Huron and St. Regis\nsignals. It is likely that some of the warriors with Tandakora are\nHurons, and, in any event, the Ojibway will understand the signals.”",
        "He imitated the cawing of a crow, and presently the answer came\nfrom the forest about a quarter of a mile to the south. The cry was\nrepeated, and the answer came duly a second time. No one in the little\nband now doubted that Tandakora and his men were there.",
        "“Shall we attack?” asked Robert.",
        "“I think we can sting them a little,” replied Willet. “Our numbers are\nfew, but the force of the Ojibway is not likely to be large. It was\nhis purpose to strike and get away, and that’s what we’ll do. Now,\nTayoga, we’re relying upon you to get us into a good position on his\nflank.”",
        "The Onondaga led them in another but much smaller circle toward the\nforest, from which the answering caws of the crow had come. The way\nwent through dense thickets but, before he reached his chosen spot, he\nstopped.",
        "“Look,” he said, pointing to the earth, where there were faint traces\nthat Robert could scarcely see and over which he would have passed,\nunnoticing. “Here is where Tandakora went on his way to the ambush. It\nis a little trail, and it was to be only a little ambush. He has only\nabout ten warriors with him. The Ojibway has come back for revenge. He\ncould not bear to leave without striking at least one blow. Perhaps he\nslipped away from Sharp Sword to try the ambush on his own account.”",
        "“They can’t be far ahead,” said the hunter.",
        "“No,” said the Onondaga. “They will be coming back in response to my\ncall, and I think we would better await them here.”",
        "They disposed themselves in good order for battle, and then sank to\nthe earth. Light waves of air registered delicately but clearly on\nthose wonderful eardrums of Tayoga’s. Faint though the sound was,\nhe understood it. It was the careful tread of men. Tandakora and his\nwarriors were on the way, called by the crow. He knew when they came\nwithin a hundred yards of where he and his companions lay, and he\nknew when they spread out in cautious fashion, to see what manner of\nfriends these were who came. He knew, too, that Tandakora would not\nwalk into a trap, and he had not expected at any time that he would,\nit having been merely his purpose when he cawed like a crow to call\nhim back to fair and honorable combat, ambush against ambush. He noted\nwhen the thin line of detached warriors began to advance again, he was\neven able to trace the step of Tandakora, heavier than the others,\nand to discern when the Ojibway chief stopped a second time, trying to\npierce the thickets with his eyes.",
        "“Tandakora is in doubt,” he whispered to Robert. “The call of the crow\nwhich at first seemed so friendly has another meaning now. He is not\nso sure that friends are here after all, but he does not understand\nhow an enemy happens to be behind him. He is angry, too, that his own\npretty ambush, in which he was sitting so cunningly waiting for us,\nis broken up. Tandakora’s humor is far from good, but, because of it,\nmine is excellent.”",
        "“You certainly learned the dictionary well when you were in our\nschools,” Robert whispered back, but as full as ever of admiration for\nTayoga’s powers. “Has all sound ceased now?”",
        "“They are not stirring. They have become quite sure that we are\nenemies and they wait for us to act first.”",
        "“Then I’ll give ’em a lead,” said Willet, who lay on Tayoga’s right.",
        "He thrust out a foot, bringing it down on a dead stick so hard that\nit broke with a sharp snap, but instantly drew away to the shelter of\nanother bush. A rifle cracked in front of them and a bullet cut the\nair over the broken stick. Before the warrior who fired the bullet\ncould sink back Black Rifle pulled the trigger at a certain target,\nand the man fell without a sound.",
        "“A fine shot, Captain Jack,” said Willet, and a few minutes later the\nhunter himself made another just as good. For a half hour the combat\nwas waged in the deep thickets, mere glimpses serving for aim, but the\ncombatants were as fierce and tenacious as if the issue were joined\nby great armies. Four warriors fell, Willet’s band suffered only a few\nscratches, and then, at a signal from him, they melted away into the\nwoods, curved about again, and took up the return journey toward their\nown force.",
        "“We did enough,” said Willet, when he was sure they were not pursued\nby Tandakora. “All we wanted to do was to sting the Ojibway and not to\nlet him forget that those who ambush may be ambushed. He’ll be fairly\nburning with anger.”",
        "“How are you feeling, Red Coat?” asked Tayoga.",
        "“As well as could be expected after such an experience,” replied\nGrosvenor with pride. But the young Englishman was very sober, too.\nA warrior had fallen before his rifle, and, with the heat of battle\nover, he was very thoughtful.",
        "They returned to the camp without further event. Colden and Strong\nwere gratified to learn that the retreat of St. Luc was real, and that\nhe was certainly going toward Champlain, with the obvious intention of\njoining Montcalm.",
        "“We owe you a great debt of gratitude, Colonel,” said the young\nofficer, frankly, to Elihu Strong. “If you had not come I don’t think\nwe could have held out against St. Luc.”",
        "“We did the best we could,” replied Elihu Strong. “If the Governor and\nLegislature of Massachusetts had done their full duty we’d have been\nhere earlier, with twice as many men and guns, but as it is we did our\nbest, and man can do no more.”",
        "They decided that they would hold the point and await the coming of\nthe great army under Abercrombie which was to crush Montcalm. The\noutworks were built higher and stronger and the brass cannon were\nmounted upon them at points, where they could sweep the forest. These\nfine twelve-pounders were sources of much moral courage and added\ngreatly to the spirits of the troops. They had shown their power at\nthe forcing of the ford and at the taking of the ridge, and their\nbrazen mouths, menacing the forest, looked well.",
        "Willet and his comrades considered it their duty to stay there also,\nand wait for Abercrombie, and, the third day after the retreat of St.\nLuc, Robert and Tayoga went into the woods to see whether Tandakora\nhad turned back again with his warriors. They reckoned that the\nOjibway chief’s anger was so strong that he would make another attempt\nat revenge upon those who had defeated him. There was a rumor that\nthe Indians with the French were becoming much dissatisfied, that\nthey were awed by the reports of the mighty British and American force\nadvancing under Abercrombie, and might leave the French to meet it\nalone.",
        "“Do you think there is much in these rumors?” asked Robert, as he and\nthe Onondaga went into the forest.",
        "“I do,” replied Tayoga. “The warriors with the French do not like the\ncannon, and they say the force that is coming against Montcalm is very\nvast. A great battle may be fought, but Tandakora and his men are not\nlikely to be there. They will go away and await a better day.”",
        "“Then I’m glad they’ll desert for a while. They’re the eyes and ears\nof the French. That will leave our own scouts and forest runners the\nlords of the wild, though it seems to me, Tayoga, that you’re the true\nand veritable lord of the wild.”",
        "“Then if that were so, though you praise my skill too much, Dagaeoga,\nyou and the Great Bear and Black Rifle also are lords of the wild.”",
        "“Lords of the wild! I like the term. It is something to be that\nat this time and in this region. We’re mainly a wilderness people,\nTayoga, and our wars are waged in the woods. We’re not more than two\nmiles from the camp now, and yet we’re completely lost in the forest.\nThere’s not a trace of man. I don’t even see any smoke soiling the\nsky.”",
        "“It is so, Dagaeoga, and we are again in the shadow of peril. Dangers\nin the forest are as thick as leaves on the trees. Here is an old\ntrail of our enemies.”",
        "“I’m not interested in old trails. What we’re looking for is new\nones.”",
        "“If we keep going toward the north it may be that we will find them,\nDagaeoga.”",
        "Several miles farther on they came to other trails which the Onondaga\nexamined with great interest and care. Two or three he pronounced\nquite recent, but he did not read any particular purpose in them.",
        "“It is likely that they were made by hunters,” he said. “While the\narmies are gathering, the warriors are sure to seek game. Here two of\nthem passed, and here they stood behind a tree. It is sure now that\nthose two were hunting. I think they stood behind a tree to ambush a\ndeer. The deer was to the west of them. The traces they left in\nthe soft earth under the tree show that the toes of their moccasins\npointed toward the west and so they were looking that way, at the\ndeer, which probably stood in the thicket over there nibbling at its\nfood. They must have had an easy shot. Now, we’ll enter the thicket.\nLo, Dagaeoga, here is where the deer fell! Look at the little bushes\nbroken and at the dark stain on the ground where its life flowed out.\nThey dragged the body to the other side of the thicket, and cut it up\nthere. Nothing could be plainer, the traces are so numerous. They were\ncasual hunters, and it is not worth our while to follow them.”",
        "Northward they still pursued their course, and struck another and\nlarger trail which made Tayoga look grave.",
        "“This is the path of seven or eight warriors,” he said, “and it is\nlikely that they are a scouting party. They have come back, as we\nexpected, to spy upon us and to cut off stragglers from our camp. We\nwill follow it a little while.”",
        "It led south by west and seemed to go on with a definite purpose, but,\nafter a mile or so, it divided, four warriors, as Tayoga said, going\nin one direction and three in the other.",
        "“Suppose I follow those on the north a short distance while you take\nthose on the south,” suggested Robert.",
        "“We will do so,” said Tayoga, “and in an hour come back to this\npoint.”",
        "The three warriors were on the north, and, as the earth was soft,\nRobert saw their trail quite clearly leading steadily west by north.\nHis own ambition to excel as a trailer was aroused and he followed it\nwith great energy. Two or three times when the ground became hard and\nrocky he lost it, but a little search always disclosed it again, and\nhe renewed the pursuit with increased zeal. He went on over a hill\nand then into a wide valley, well grown with thickets. Pushing his way\nthrough the bushes he sought the traces and was startled by a sound\nalmost at his shoulder. Keyed to the dangers of the forest he whirled\ninstantly, but it was too late. A powerful warrior threw himself upon\nhim, and though Robert, by a great effort, threw him off he sprang\nback and another on the other side also seized him. He was borne to\nthe earth and a third Indian coming up, he was quickly secured.",
        "Robert at first was so sick with chagrin that he did not think about\nhis life. In nine cases out of ten the warriors would have tomahawked\nhim, and this he soon realized, thankful at the same time that he had\nbeen spared, for the present, at least. Yet his mortification endured.\nWhat would Tayoga say when he saw by the trail that he had been\ncaught so easily? He had fairly walked into the trap, and he was now\na prisoner the second time. Yet he showed the stoicism that he had\nlearned in a forest life. While the Indians bound his wrists tightly\nwith rawhide thongs he stood up and looked them squarely in the face.",
        "One of the warriors took his rifle and examined it with a pleased\neye. Another appropriated his pistol and a third helped himself to his\nknife and hatchet.",
        "“I’ve four shillings in an inside pocket,” said Robert. “If you want\n’em, take ’em.”",
        "But the warriors did not understand English and shook their heads.\nEvidently they were satisfied with the spoil they had taken already.",
        "“Which way?” asked Robert.",
        "They replied by leading him to the northwest. He was hopeful at first\nthat Tayoga might rescue him as he had done once before, but the\nwarriors were wary and powerful, and three, too, were too many for the\nOnondaga alone to attack. The thought passed and by an effort of the\nwill he resigned himself to his immediate captivity. They did not mean\nto take his life, and while there was no hope for the present there\nwas plenty of it for the future. He could be in a far worse case. His\nunfailing optimism broke through the shell of mortification, and he\nbecame resolutely cheerful.",
        "“Which way, my friends?” he said to the warriors.",
        "But again they understood no English and shook their heads.",
        "“Don’t plume yourself too much on that rifle,” he said, speaking to\nthe warrior who had taken his favorite weapon. “You have it for the\npresent, but when I escape for the second time I mean to take it with\nme. I give you fair warning.”",
        "The warrior, who seemed to be good natured, shook his head once more,\nand grinned, not abating at all his air of proprietorship so far as\nthe rifle was concerned.",
        "“And you with the pistol,” continued the prisoner, “I beg to tell\nyou it’s mine, not yours, and I shall claim it again. What, you don’t\nunderstand? Well, I’ll have to find some way to make you comprehend\nlater on.”",
        "The three warriors walked briskly and Robert, of course, had no choice\nbut to keep pace with them. They indicated very conclusively that they\nknew where they meant to go, and so he assumed that a hostile camp was\nnot very far away. Resolved to show no sign of discouragement, he held\nhis head erect and stepped springily.",
        "About three miles, and he saw a gleam of uniforms through the trees,\na few steps more and his heart gave a leap. He beheld a group\nof Indians, and several Frenchmen, and one of them, tall, young,\ndistinguished, was St. Luc.",
        "The Chevalier was in a white uniform, trimmed with silver, a silver\nhilted small sword by his side, and his smile was not unpleasant when\nhe said to Robert:",
        "“I sent out these three warriors to find me a prisoner and bring him\nin, but I little suspected that it would be you.”",
        "“I suspected as little that it was you to whom I was being taken,\"\nsaid Robert. “But since I had to be a prisoner I’m glad I’m yours\ninstead of De Courcelles’ or Jumonville’s, as those two soldiers of\nFrance have as little cause to love me as I have to love them.”",
        "“Monsieur De Courcelles is suffering from a bullet wound.”",
        "“It was my bullet.”",
        "“You say that rather proudly, but perhaps I’d better not tell it to\nhim. It seems, Mr. Lennox, that you have a certain facility in getting\nyourself captured, as this is the second time within a year.”",
        "“I was treated so well by the French that I thought I could risk it\nagain,” said Robert jauntily.",
        "The Chevalier smiled. Robert felt again that current of understanding\nand sympathy, that, so it seemed to him, had passed so often between\nthem.",
        "“I see,” said St. Luc, “that you are willing to give credit to France,\nthe evergreen nation, the nation of light and eternal life. We may\nlose at times, we may be defeated at times, but we always rise anew.\nYou British and Americans will realize that some day.”",
        "“I do not hate France.”",
        "“I don’t think you do. But this is scarcely a time for me to give you\na lecture on French qualities. Sit down on this log. I trust that my\nwarriors did not treat you with undue harshness.”",
        "“I’ve nothing to complain of. They took my weapons, but that is\nthe law of war. I’d have done the same in their place. As I see it,\nthey’re not particularly bad Indians. But if you don’t mind, I’d like\nyou to cut these rawhide thongs that bind my wrists. They’re beginning\nto sting.”",
        "The Chevalier drew a knife and with one sweep of its keen edge severed\nthe rawhide. Robert’s wrists flew apart and the blood once more flowed\nfreely through his veins. Though the stinging did not cease he felt\ngreat relief.",
        "“I thank you,” he said politely, “but, as I told you before, I do not\nhold it against your warriors, because they bound me. I’d have escaped\nhad they given me any chance at all, and I warn you now, as I warned\nthem, that I intend to escape later on.”",
        "St. Luc smiled.",
        "“I’ll accept the challenge,” he said, “and I’ll see that you don’t\nmake good your boast. I can assure you, too, if by any possibility you\nshould escape, it certainly will not be before the great battle.”",
        "“Great battle! What great battle? You don’t mean that Montcalm will\ndare to meet Abercrombie?”",
        "“Such an idea was in my mind.”",
        "“Why, we’ll come with four or five to one! The Marquis de Montcalm\ncannot stand against such a powerful force as ours. We’ve definite\ninformation that he won’t be able to muster more than three or four\nthousand men. We hear, too, that the Indians, frightened by our power,\nare leaving him, for the time, at least.”",
        "“Some of your surmises may be correct, but your facts don’t follow\nfrom them. The Marquis de Montcalm, our great leader, will await your\nAbercrombie, no matter what your force may be. I violate no military\nsecret when I tell you that, and I tell you also that you are very far\nfrom being assured of any victory.”",
        "The Chevalier suddenly dropped his light manner, and became intensely\nearnest. His eyes gleamed for an instant with blue fire, but it was\nonly a passing moment of emotion. He was in an instant his old, easy\nself again.",
        "“We talk like the debaters of the schools,” he said, “when we are\nat war. I am to march in a few minutes. I suggest that in return for\ncertain liberties you give me your pledge to attempt no escape until\nwe arrive at the camp of the Marquis de Montcalm.”",
        "“I can’t do it. Since I’ve promised you that I will escape I must\nneglect no chance.”",
        "“So be it. Then I must guard you well, but I will not have your wrists\nbound again. Here comes an expert rover of the forest who will be your\nimmediate jailer.”",
        "A white man at the head of several warriors was approaching through\nthe woods. He was young, lean, with a fierce, hooked Roman nose, and\na bold, aggressive face, tanned to the color of mahogany. Robert\nrecognized him at once, and since he had to be a prisoner a second\ntime, he took a certain pleasure in the meeting.",
        "“How do you do, Monsieur Langlade?” he said. “You see, I’ve come back.\nI forgot to tell you good-by, and I’m here to make amends for my lack\nof politeness. And how is the patient and watchful spouse, the Dove?”",
        "Robert spoke in good French and the partisan stared in astonishment.\nThen a pleased look of recognition came into his eyes.",
        "“Ah, it’s young Mr. Lennox,” he exclaimed. “Young Mr. Lennox come back\nto us. It’s not mere politeness that makes me tell you I’m glad to\nsee you. You did make a very clever escape with the aid of that Indian\nfriend of yours. I hope to capture Tayoga some day, and, if I do, it\nwill be an achievement of which I shall boast all the rest of my life.\nBut we’ll take good care that you don’t leave us again.”",
        "“He has just warned me that he intends to escape a second time,” said\nSt. Luc.",
        "“Then it will be a pretty test of mettle,” said the Owl, appreciation\nshowing in his tone, “and we welcome it. Have you any commands for me,\nsir?”",
        "He spoke with great respect when he addressed the query to St. Luc,\nand the Chevalier replied that they would march in a half hour. Then\nLanglade gave Robert food, and took a little himself, sitting with the\nprisoner and informing him that the Dove had worried greatly over his\nescape. Although she was not to blame, she considered that in some\nindirect manner it was a reflection upon her vigilance, and it was\nmany months before she was fully consoled.",
        "“I must send word to her by one of our runners that you have been\nretaken,” said the Owl, “and I wish to tell you, Mr. Lennox, that the\nDove’s younger sister, who is so much like her in looks and character,\nis still unmarried and perhaps it may come into the mind of the\nChevalier de St. Luc or the Marquis de Montcalm to send you back to\nour village.”",
        "“You’re once more most polite,” laughed Robert, “but I’m far too\nyoung, yet, to think of marriage.”",
        "“It’s not an offer that I’d make to many young men,” said Langlade\nregretfully. “In truth, I know of none other to whom I’d have\nmentioned it.”",
        "When they took up the march the force numbered about fifty men, and\nRobert walked between Langlade and a stalwart Indian. St. Luc\nwas further on. They did not seem to fear any ambush and Langlade\nchattered after his fashion. He made the most of the French resources.\nHe spoke as if the Marquis de Montcalm had ten or fifteen thousand\nveteran French regulars, and half as many Indian warriors.",
        "“Don’t consider me contentious, Monsieur Langlade,” said Robert, at\nlast, “but I know full well that your general has not half that many\ntroops, no, not a third, and that nearly all his Indians are about to\nleave him.”",
        "“And how do you know that?” exclaimed the Owl. “Well, one Frenchman\nequals two of the English or the Bostonnais, and that doubles our\nnumbers. You don’t see any chance to escape, do you?”",
        "“Not at present,” laughed Robert.",
        "“Not now, nor at any other time. No man ever escapes twice from the\nFrench.”",
        "The talk of Langlade, his frank egotism and boastfulness for himself\npersonally and for the French collectively, beguiled the journey which\nsoon became strenuous, the force advancing at a great pace through\nthe forest. At night a fire was built in the deep woods, the knapsacks\nfurnished plenty of food, and Robert slept soundly on a blanket until\ndawn. He had seen before closing his eyes that a strict guard was set,\nand he knew that it was not worth while to keep awake in the hope of\nescape. Like a wise man he dismissed the hope of the impossible at\nonce, and waited calmly for another time. He knew too that St. Luc had\noriginally sent out his warriors to capture a prisoner from whom\nthey might drag information, but that the Chevalier would not try to\ncross-examine him, knowing its futility.",
        "They traveled northward by east all the next day, through very rough\ncountry, slept another night in the forest, and on the third day\napproached a great camp, which held the main French force. Robert’s\nheart thrilled. Here was the center of the French power in North\nAmerica. Vaudreuil and Bigot at Quebec might plan and plot and weave\ntheir webs, but in the end the mighty struggle between French and\nEnglish and their colonies must be decided by the armies.",
        "He knew that this was the outlet of Lake George and he knew also that\nthe army of Abercrombie was gathering at the head of the same lake.\nHis interest grew keener as they drew nearer. He saw clusters of\ntents, cannon parked, and many fires. There were no earthworks or\nother fortifications, and he inferred from their absence that Montcalm\nwas undecided whether to go or stay. But Robert thought proudly that\nhe would surely go, when the invincible Anglo-American army advanced\nfrom its base at the head of the lake. The whole camp lay under his\neye, and he had enough military experience now to judge the French\nnumbers by its size. He did not think they were much in excess of\nthree thousand, and as Abercrombie would come four or five to one,\nMontcalm must surely retreat.",
        "“I take it that this is Ticonderoga,” he said to St. Luc.",
        "“Aye,” replied the Chevalier.",
        "“And in effect you have Champlain on one side of you and George on the\nother. But you can’t hold the place against our great force. I’m here\nin time to join you in your retreat.”",
        "“We don’t seem to be retreating, as you’ll notice, Mr. Lennox, and I\ndon’t know that we will. Still, that rests on the knees of the gods.\nI think you’ll find here some old friends and enemies of yours, and\nthough your people have made a great outcry against the Marquis de\nMontcalm because of the affair at Fort William Henry, I am sure you\nwill find that the French know how to treat a prisoner. I shall put\nyou for the present in the care of Monsieur Langlade, with whom you\nappear to have no quarrel. He has his instructions.”",
        "It was the second time that Robert had entered the camp of Montcalm\nand his keen interest drove away for the present all thought of\nhimself. He noted anew the uniforms, mostly white faced with blue or\nviolet or red or yellow, and with black, three-cornered hats. There\nwere the battalions of Guienne, La Reine, Béarn, La Sarre, Languedoc,\nBerry and Royal Roussillon. The Canadians, swarthy, thick and strong,\nwore white with black facings. Some Indians were about, but fewer than\nRobert had expected. It was true then that they had become alarmed at\nAbercrombie’s advancing might, and were leaving the French to their\nfate.",
        "“You are to stay in a tent with me,” said Langlade, “and you will be\nso thoroughly surrounded by the army, that you will have no earthly\nchance of escape. So I think it better that you pledge your word not\nto attempt it for a while, and I can make things easier for you.”",
        "“No, I decline again to give such a pledge,” said Robert firmly. “I\nwarn you, as I’ve warned the Chevalier de St. Luc, that I’m going to\nescape.”",
        "Langlade looked at him searchingly, and then the face of the partisan\nkindled.",
        "“I believe you mean it!” he exclaimed. “You rely on yourself and you\nthink, too, that clever Onondaga, Tayoga, will come again to your\naid. I acknowledge that he’s a great trailer, that he’s master of some\nthings that even I, Charles Langlade, the Owl, do not know, but he\ncannot steal you away a second time.”",
        "“I admit that I’ve been thinking of Tayoga. He may be here now close\nto us.”",
        "The Owl gave a startled look at the empty air, as if he expected\nTayoga to be hovering there, formidable but invisible.",
        "“I see you do fear him,” laughed Robert.",
        "“I do, but we shall be a match for him this time, though I never\nunderrate his powers.”",
        "A young officer in a captain’s uniform stopped suddenly and looked at\nRobert. Then he advanced and extended his hand.",
        "“It is evident that you like the French,” he said, “since you are\ncontinually coming back to them.”",
        "“De Galissonnière!” exclaimed Robert, as he warmly shook the extended\nhand. “Yes, here I am, and I do like many of the French. I’m sorry\nwe’re official enemies.”",
        "“I know that our people will treat you well,” jested De Galissonnière,\n\"and then, when we take New York, you can tell the inhabitants of that\ncity what good masters we are and teach them to be reconciled.”",
        "Young Lennox made a reply in like spirit, and De Galissonnière passed\non. But a man walking near with his shoulder well bound greeted him in\nno such friendly manner. Instead a heavy frown came over his face\nand his eyes flashed cruelly. It was De Courcelles, nursing the wound\nRobert had given him, and at the same time increasing his anger. The\nyouth returned his gaze defiantly.",
        "“Colonel De Courcelles does not like you,” said Langlade, who had\nnoticed the brief exchange.",
        "“He does not,” replied Robert. “It was my bullet that hurt his\nshoulder, but I gave him the wound in fair combat.”",
        "“And he hates you because of it?”",
        "“That and other things.”",
        "“What a strange man! A wound received in fair and honorable battle\nshould be a tie that binds. If you had given it to me in a combat on\nequal terms I’d have considered it an honor conferred upon me by you.\nIt would have wiped away all grievance and have made us friends.”",
        "“Then, Monsieur Langlade, I’m afraid I missed my opportunity to make\nour friendship warmer than it is.”",
        "“How is that?”",
        "“I held you also under the muzzle of my rifle in that battle in the\nforest, but when I recognized you I could not send the bullet. I\nturned the weapon aside.”",
        "“Ah, that was in truth a most worthy and chivalrous act! Embrace me,\nmy friend!”",
        "“No! No! We American men never embrace or kiss one another!”",
        "“I should have remembered. A cold people! But never mind! You are my\nbrother, and I esteem you so highly that I shall let nothing on earth\ntake you away from us. Can you not reconsider your decision about\nthe sister of the Dove? She would make you a most admirable wife, and\nafter the war we could become the greatest rangers, you and I, that\nthe forest has ever known. And the life in the woods is marvelous in\nits freedom and variety!”",
        "But Robert plead extreme youth once more, and the Owl was forced to be\nresigned. The small tent in which guard and prisoner were to sleep was\nalmost in the center of the camp and Robert truly would have needed\nwings and the power of invisibility to escape then. Instead of it he\nlet the thought pass for a while and went to sleep on a blanket.",
        "While young Lennox slept St. Luc was in the tent of Montcalm talking\nwith his leader. The Marquis was in much perplexity. His spies had\nbrought him word of the great force that was mustering in the south,\nand he did not know whether to await the attack at Ticonderoga or\nto retreat to the powerful fortifications at Crown Point on Lake\nChamplain. His own ardent soul, flushed by the successes he had\nalready won, told him to stay, but prudence bade him go. Now he wanted\nto hear what St. Luc had to say and wanting it he knew also that the\nChevalier was the most valiant and daring of his captains. He wished\nto hear from the dauntless leader just what he wished to hear and\nnothing else.",
        "“Your observations, then, confirm what the spies have reported?” he\nsaid. “The enemy can easily control Lake George!”",
        "“He has only to make an effort to do so, my general,” replied St.\nLuc. “I could have captured the boat builders on the point or have\ncompelled their retirement, but large forces came to their relief. The\nnumbers of the foe are even greater than we had feared.”",
        "“How many men do you think General Abercrombie will have when he\nadvances against us?”",
        "“Not less than fifteen thousand, sir, perhaps more.”",
        "The face of Montcalm fell.",
        "“As many as that!” he exclaimed. “It is more than four to one!”",
        "“He cannot have less, sir,” repeated St. Luc positively.",
        "Montcalm’s brow clouded and he paced back and forth.",
        "“And the Indians who have been so powerful an ally,” he said at last.\n\"They are frightened by the reports concerning the Anglo-American\narmy. After their fashion they wish to run away before superior force,\nand fight when the odds are not so great. It is most embarrassing to\nlose their help, at such a critical time. Can you do nothing with this\nsullen giant, Tandakora, who has such influence over them?”",
        "“I fear not, sir. He was with me on the expedition from which I have\njust returned, and he fared ill. He is in a most savage humor. He is\nlike a bear that will hide in the woods and lick its hurts until the\nsting has passed. I think we may consider it certain, sir, that they\nwill desert us, for the time.”",
        "“And we shall have but little more than three thousand French and\nCanadians to defend the honor of France and His Majesty’s great colony\nin North America. We might retreat to the fortifications at Crown\nPoint, and make an advantageous stand there, but it goes ill with me\nto withdraw. Still, prudence cries upon me to do so. I have talked\nwith Bourlamaque, Trepezec, Lotbiniére, the engineer, Langy, the\npartisan, and other of my lieutenants whom you know. They express\nvarying opinions. Now, Colonel de St. Luc, I want yours, an opinion\nthat is absolutely your own.”",
        "St. Luc drew himself up and his warrior soul flashed through his blue\neyes.",
        "“Sir,” he said, “it goes as ill with me as it does with you to\nretreat. My heart is here at Ticonderoga. Nor does prudence suggest to\nme that we retreat to Crown Point. My head agreeing with my heart says\nthat we should stand here.”",
        "“And that is your conviction?”",
        "“It is, sir. Ticonderoga is ours and we can keep it.”",
        "“Upon what do you base this opinion? In such a crisis as this we must\nbe influenced by sound military reasons and not by sentiment.”",
        "“My reasons, sir, are military. That is why my heart goes with\nmy head. It is true that the Anglo-American army will come in\noverwhelming numbers, but they may be overwhelming numbers that will\nnot overwhelm. As we know, the British commanders have not adapted\nthemselves as well as the French to wilderness, campaigning. Their\ntactics and strategy are the same as those they practice in the open\nfields of Europe, and it puts them at a great disadvantage. We have\nbeen willing to learn from the Indians, who have practiced forest\nwarfare for centuries. And the British Colonials, the Bostonnais,\nfall into the faults of the parent country. In spite of all experience\nthey, continue to despise wilderness wile and stratagem, and in a\nmanner that is amazing. They walk continually into ambush, and are cut\nup before they can get out of it. I am not one to cheapen the valor\nof British and British Colonials. It has been proved too often on\ndesperate fields, but in the kind of war we must wage here deep in the\nwilds of North America, valor is often unavailing, and I think, sir,\nthat we can rely upon one fact. The enemy will take us too lightly. He\nis sure to do something that will keep him from using his whole force\nat the right moment against us. Our forest knowledge will work all\nthe time in our behalf. I entreat you, sir, to keep the army here at\nTiconderoga and await the attack.”",
        "St. Luc spoke with intense earnestness, and his words had all the ring\nof conviction. Montcalm’s dark face was illumined. Again he walked\nback and forth, in deep thought.",
        "“The engineer, Lotbiniére, a man whose opinion I respect, is of\nyour mind,” he said at last. “He says that whether Crown Point or\nTiconderoga, it’s merely either horn of the dilemma, and naturally, if\nthe dangers of the two places are even, we prefer Ticonderoga and no\nretreat. The Marquis de Vaudreuil had a plan to save Ticonderoga by\nmeans of a diversion with a heavy force under Bourlamaque, De Levis\nand Longueuil into the Mohawk Valley. But some American rangers taken\nnear Lake George by Langy told him that Abercrombie already had thirty\nthousand men at the head of George and the Marquis at once abandoned\nthe scheme. It was lucky for us the rangers exaggerated so much that\nthe plan was destined to failure, as we needed here the men who were\nsent on it. We save or lose Ticonderoga by fighting at Ticonderoga\nitself and by nothing else. I thank you, Colonel de St. Luc, for your\ngallant and timely words, I have been wavering and they have decided\nme. We stay here and await the Anglo-American army.”",
        "“And the star of France will not fail us,” said St Luc, with intense\nconviction.",
        "“I trust not. I feel more confidence since I have decided, and I\ndo know this: the young men who are my lieutenants are as brave and\nskillful leaders as any chief could desire. And the troops will fight\neven ten to one, if I ask it of them. It is a pleasure and a glory to\ncommand troops of such incomparable bravery as the French. But we must\ntry to keep the Indians with us. I confess that I know little about\ndealing with them. Has this savage chief, Tandakora, come back to\nTiconderoga?”",
        "“I think he is here, sir. Do you wish me to talk with him?”",
        "“I do. I wish it very much.”",
        "“He is very sullen, sir. He holds that the Indians have received no\nrewards for their services.”",
        "“We have given them blankets and food and muskets and ammunition.”",
        "“He takes those as a matter of course. But he means something else.\nTo tell you the truth, sir, the savages want us to give prisoners to\nthem.”",
        "Montcalm’s face clouded again.",
        "“To burn at the stake, or to torture to death otherwise!” he\nexclaimed. “My reputation and what is more, the reputation of France,\nsuffers already from the massacre at William Henry, though God knows\nI would have prevented it if I could. It happened so suddenly and so\nunexpectedly that I could not stop it, until the harm was done. But\nnever, St. Luc, never will I give up a prisoner to them for their\ntortures, though every savage in our armies desert us!”",
        "“I hold with you, sir, that we cannot surrender prisoners to them,\neven though the cause of France should suffer.”",
        "“Then talk to this savage chief. Make him see reason. Promise him and\nhis people what you wish in muskets, ammunition, blankets and such\nthings, but no prisoners, not one.”",
        "St. Luc, with a respectful salute, left the tent. He was torn by\nconflicting emotions. He was depressed over the smallness of the\nFrench numbers, and yet he was elated by Montcalm’s decision to stay\nat Ticonderoga and await Abercrombie. He was confident, as he had\nsaid, that some lucky chance would happen, and that the overwhelming\nsuperiority of the Anglo-American army would be nullified.",
        "The Chevalier cast a discriminating eye over the French position. The\nstaunch battalion of Berry lay near the foot of Lake George, but the\ngreater part of the army under the direct command of Montcalm was in\ncamp near a saw mill. The valiant Bourlamaque was at the head of\nthe portage, and another force held the point of embarkation on Lake\nGeorge. But he knew that Montcalm would change these dispositions when\nthe day of battle came.",
        "On the westward side of the camp several fires burned and dark\nfigures lay near them. St. Luc marked one of these, a gigantic savage,\nstretched at his ease, and he walked toward him. He pretended, at\nfirst, that his errand had nothing to do with Tandakora, but stood\nthoughtfully by the fire, for a minute or two. Nor did the Ojibway\nchief take any notice. He lay at ease, and it was impossible to tell\nwhat thoughts were hidden behind his sullen face.",
        "“Does Tandakora know what the commander of the French army has decided\nto do?” said St. Luc, at last.",
        "“Tandakora is not thinking much about it,” replied the chief.",
        "“Montcalm is a brave general. He shows that he is not afraid of the\ngreat army the English and the Bostonnais have gathered. He will not\nretreat to Crown Point or anywhere else, but will stay at Ticonderoga\nand defeat his foes.”",
        "The black eyes of the Ojibway flickered.",
        "“Tandakora does not undertake to tell Montcalm what he must do,” he\nsaid, “nor must Montcalm undertake to tell Tandakora what he should\ndo. What Montcalm may do will not now keep Tandakora awake.”",
        "St. Luc’s heart filled with hot anger, but he was used to dealing\nwith Indians. He understood their minds from the inside, and he had a\nsuperb self-control of his own.",
        "“We know that Tandakora is a great chief,” he said evenly. “We know\ntoo that he and his men are as free as the winds. As they blow where\nthey please so the warriors of Tandakora go where they wish. But\nOnontio [The Governor-General of Canada.] and Tandakora have long been\nfriends. They have been allies, they have fought side by side in many\na battle. If Onontio falls, Tandakora falls with him. If the British\nand Bostonnais are victorious, there will be room for none of the\ntribes save the League of the Hodenosaunee, and them Tandakora hates.\nOnontio will not be able to protect them any more, and they will be\ndriven from all their hunting grounds.”",
        "He paused to watch his words take effect and they obviously stirred\nthe soul of the savage chief who moved uneasily.",
        "“It is true,” he said. “Sharp Sword never tells a falsehood. If\nOnontio is struck down then the British, the Bostonnais and the\nHodenosaunee triumph, but my warriors bring me word that our enemies\nhave gathered the greatest force the world has ever seen at the head\nof Andiatarocte. They come thicker than the leaves of the forest. They\nhave more guns than we can count. They will trample Montcalm and his\nsoldiers under their feet. So, according to our custom, Tandakora and\nhis warriors would go away into the forest, until the British and\nthe Bostonnais scatter, unable to find us. Then, when they are not\nlooking, we will strike them and take many scalps.”",
        "Tandakora spoke in his most impressive manner, and, when he ceased,\nhis eyes met St. Luc’s defiantly. Again the blood of the Chevalier\nburned with wrath, but as before he restrained himself, and his smooth\nvoice gave no hint of anger as he replied:",
        "“Odds are of no avail against Montcalm. The children of Onontio are\nused to dealing with them. Remember, Tandakora, the great victories\nMontcalm won at Oswego and William Henry. He has the soul of a mighty\nchief. He has decided to stay here at Ticonderoga and await the enemy,\nconfident that he will win the victory. Tandakora is a great warrior,\nis he willing to have no share in such a triumph?”",
        "The cruel eyes of the Ojibway glistened.",
        "“The heart of Tandakora is heavy within him,” he said. “He and his\nwarriors are not afraid of the British and the Bostonnais. They\nhave fought by the side of Montcalm, but they do not receive all the\nrewards that Onontio owes them.”",
        "“Onontio has given to them freely of his muskets and powder and\nbullets, and of his blankets and food.”",
        "“But he takes from them the prisoners. We have no scalps to carry\nhome.”",
        "“It is against the custom of the French to put prisoners to death or\ntorture. Moreover, we have no prisoners here. The rangers taken by\nLangy have already been sent to Canada.”",
        "“There is one in the camp now. He was captured by three of my\nwarriors, those you sent out, and by the law of war he belongs to me.\nYet Sharp Sword and Montcalm hold him. I speak of the youth Lennox,\nthe comrade of the Onondaga, Tayoga, who is my bitterest enemy. I hate\nLennox too because he has stood so often in my way and I demand him,\nto do with as I please, because it is my right.”",
        "The Ojibway moved close to St. Luc and the fierce black eyes glared\ninto those of stern blue. The Chevalier did not change his smooth,\nplacatory tone as he replied:",
        "“I cannot give up Lennox. It is true that he was taken by your\nwarriors, but they were then in my service, so he is my prisoner. But\nhe is only a single captive, a lad. Ask for some other and greater\nreward, Tandakora, and it shall be yours.”",
        "“Give me the prisoner, Lennox, and I and my warriors stay and fight\nwith you at Ticonderoga. Refuse him and we go.”",
        "The chief’s words were sharp and decisive and St. Luc understood him.\nHe knew that the savage Ojibway hated young Lennox intensely, and\nwould put him to the torture. He never hesitated an instant.",
        "“I cannot yield the prisoner to you,” he said. “The custom of the\nFrench will not permit it.”",
        "“The warriors are a great help in battle, and the reward I ask is but\nsmall. St. Luc knows that Montcalm needs men here. What is this boy to\nSt. Luc that he refuses so great a price for him?”",
        "“It cannot be done, Tandakora. I keep the prisoner, Lennox, and later\nI will send him to Canada to be held there until the war is over.”",
        "“Then the forest to-morrow will swallow up Tandakora and his\nwarriors.”",
        "The chief returned to the fire and lay at ease in his blanket. St. Luc\nwalked thoughtfully back toward the tent of Montcalm. He knew that it\nwas his duty to report the offer of Tandakora to his chief, but he did\nso reluctantly.",
        "“You have refused it already?” said the Marquis.",
        "“I have, sir,” replied St. Luc.",
        "“Then you have done well. I confirm you in the refusal.”",
        "St. Luc saluted with great respect, and again retired from the tent.",
        "Robert awoke the next morning, well physically, but depressed\nmentally. He believed that a great battle–and a great victory for the\nAnglo-American army–was coming, and he would have no part in it. The\nlosses of Braddock’s defeat and the taking of Fort William Henry by\nMontcalm would be repaired, once more the flag of his native land and\nof his ancestral land, would be triumphant, but he would be merely\na spectator, even if he were as much as that. It was a bitter\nreflection, and again he thought of escape. But no plan seemed\npossible. He was held as firmly in the center of an army, as if he\nwere in the jaws of a powerful vise. Nor was it possible for Tayoga,\nhowever great his skill and daring, to reach him there. He strove\nto be philosophical, but it is hard for youth to reconcile itself at\nfirst, though it may soon forget.",
        "Breakfast was given to him, and he was permitted to go outside the\ntent into a small open space, though not beyond. On all sides of him\nstretched the impassable lines of the French army. There were several\nother prisoners within the enclosure, a ranger, a hunter, and three or\nfour farmers who had been taken in forays farther south.",
        "The fresh air and the brilliant sunshine revived Robert’s spirits. He\nlooked eagerly about him, striving to divine the French intentions,\nbut he could make nothing of them. He knew, however, upon reflection,\nthat this would be so. The French would not put any prisoners in a\nposition to obtain information that would be of great value in the\npossible event of escape.",
        "He undertook to talk with the other prisoners, but they were a\nmelancholy lot, not to be cheered. They were all thinking of a long,\nin truth, an indefinite, imprisonment in Canada, and they mourned.\nMany people had been taken into Canada by French and Indians in former\nforays and had been lost forever.",
        "Robert turned away from his comrades and sat down on a stone, where\nhe speculated idly on what was passing about him. He believed that the\nFrench would withdraw to Crown Point, at least, and might retreat all\nthe way to Canada, leaving Lake Champlain, as well as Lake George, to\nthe complete control of the Anglo-American forces. He expected to see\npreparations to that effect, and, when he saw none, he concluded that\nthey were merely postponed for a day or two. So far as he could judge,\nthe aspect of the French army was leisurely. He did not observe any\nsigns of trepidation, but then, withdrawal was always easy in the\ngreat North American wilderness. There was yet plenty of time for it.",
        "He noticed a complete absence of Indians, and the fact struck him with\ngreat surprise. While he was advancing various theories to account\nfor it, young Captain Louis de Galissonnière came, and greeted him\ncordially.",
        "“I hope you understand that we French know how to treat a prisoner,\"\nhe said.",
        "“I’ve nothing of which to complain,” replied Robert. “This is the\nsecond time that I’ve been with you, and on this occasion, as on the\nfirst, I seem to be more of a guest than a captive.”",
        "“You’re the special prisoner of Colonel de St. Luc, who stands\nextremely high with the Marquis de Montcalm. The colonel wishes you to\nbe treated well and seems to favor you. Why is it?”",
        "“Frankly, I don’t know, but I learned long since that he was a most\nchivalrous foe. I suppose I am to be sent into Canada along with the\nother prisoners?”",
        "“I suppose so, but there is no way for you to go just now.”",
        "“Why can’t I go with your army?”",
        "“With our army?”",
        "“It retreats, of course, before our overwhelming force.”",
        "De Galissonnière laughed.",
        "“You are disposed to be facetious,” he said. “You will observe that we\nare not retreating. You see no preparations to do so, but that’s all\nI will tell you. More would be valuable information for the enemy,\nshould you escape.”",
        "“I’ve warned Colonel de St. Luc that I mean to escape in due time. I\ndon’t like to reject such noble hospitality as you’re showing me, but\nmy duty to my country demands it.”",
        "Robert was now in a most excellent humor. His sanguine temperament\nwas asserting itself to the full. What he wished to see he saw. He was\nslipping away from the French; and he was advancing with the English\nand Americans to a great and brilliant victory. His face was flushed\nand his eyes sparkled. De Galissonnière looked at him curiously, but\nsaid nothing.",
        "“I observe one very significant fact,” continued Robert.",
        "“What is that?”",
        "“I see no Indians, who are usually so numerous about your camps. You\nneedn’t tell me what has happened, but I’ve been among Indians a great\ndeal. I know their ways, and I’ll tell you. They see that yours is a\nlost cause, and they’ve deserted you. Now, isn’t that so?”",
        "The young Frenchman was silent, but it was the turn of his face to\nflush.",
        "“I didn’t expect you to answer me in words,” continued Robert,\ntriumphantly, “but I can see. The Indians never fight in a battle that\nthey consider lost before it’s joined, and you know as well as I do,\nCaptain de Galissonnière, that if the Marquis de Montcalm awaits our\nattack his army will be destroyed.”",
        "“I do not know it at all.”",
        "Then Robert felt ashamed because he had been led away by his\nenthusiasm, and apologized for a speech that might have seemed\nboastful to the young Frenchman, who had been so kind to him. But De\nGalissonnière, with his accustomed courtesy, said it was nothing, and\nwhen he left, presently, both were in the best of humors.",
        "Robert, convinced that he had been right about the Indians, watched\nfor them as the morning went on, but he never saw a single warrior.\nThere could be no doubt now that they had gone, and while he could not\nconsider them chivalric they were at least wise.",
        "The next familiar face that he beheld was one far from welcome to him.\nIt was that of a man who happened to pass near the enclosure and who\nstopped suddenly when he caught sight of Robert. He was in civilian\ndress, but he was none other than Achille Garay, that spy whose secret\nmessage had been wrested from him in the forest by Robert and Tayoga.",
        "The gaze that Garay bent upon Robert was baleful. His capture by the\nthree and the manner in which he had been compelled to disclose the\nletter had been humiliating, and Robert did not doubt that the man\nwould seek revenge. He shivered a little, feeling that as a prisoner\nhe was in a measure helpless. Then his back stiffened.",
        "“I’m glad to see, Garay, that you’re where you belong–with the\nFrench,” he called out. “I hope you didn’t suffer any more from hunger\nin the woods when Willet, the Onondaga and I let you go.”",
        "The spy came closer, and his look was so full of venom that young\nLennox, despite himself, shuddered.",
        "“Time makes all things even,” he said. “I don’t forget how you and\nyour friends held me in your power in the forest, but here you are a\nprisoner. I have a good chance to make the score even.”",
        "Robert remembered also how this man had attempted his life in Albany,\nfor some reason that he could not yet fathom, and he felt that he\nwas now, and, in very truth, a most dangerous enemy. Nevertheless, he\nreplied, quietly:",
        "“That was an act of war. You were carrying a message for the enemy.\nWe were wholly within our rights when we forced you to disclose the\npaper.”",
        "“It makes no difference,” said Garay. “I owe you and your comrades a\ndebt and I shall pay it.”",
        "Robert turned his back on him and walked to the other side of the\nenclosure. When he turned around, five minutes later, Garay was gone.\nBut Robert felt uncomfortable. Here was a man who did not have the\ngallantry and chivalry that marked so many of the French. If he could\nhe would strike some great blow.",
        "He strove to dismiss Garay from his mind, and, in his interest in what\nwas going on about him, he finally succeeded. He saw Frenchmen and\nCanadians leaving the camp and others returning. His knowledge of war\nmade him believe that those coming had been messengers sent forth to\nwatch the Anglo-American army, and those going were dispatched on the\nsame service. Their alarm must be great, he reflected pleasantly,\nand none could bring to Montcalm any reassuring news. Once he saw\nMontcalm, and once St. Luc, but neither spoke to him.",
        "He and his comrades, the other prisoners, slept that night in the\nopen, the weather being warm. A blanket was allotted to every one by\ntheir captors, and Robert, long used to unlimited fresh air, preferred\nthe outside to the inside of a tent. Nothing disturbed his slumbers,\nbut he expected that the French retreat would begin the next day. On\nthe contrary, Montcalm stayed in his camp, nor was there any sign of\nwithdrawal on the second and third days, or on others that came. He\ninferred then that the advance of Abercrombie had been delayed,\nand the French were merely hanging on until their retreat became\ncompulsory.",
        "He had been in the camp about a week, and as he saw no more of Garay\nhe concluded that the man had been sent away on some errand. It\nwas highly probable that he was now in the south spying upon the\nAnglo-American army. It was for just such duties that he was fitted.\nThen he began to think of him less and less.",
        "His old impatience and keen disappointment because he was a prisoner\nwhen such great days were coming, returned with doubled vigor. He\nchafed greatly and looked around again for an opportunity to escape,\nbut did not see the remotest possibility of it. After all, he must\nreconcile himself. His situation could be far worse. He was well\ntreated, and some of the French leaders, while official enemies, were\npersonal friends.",
        "His mind also dwelled upon the singular fact that the French army did\nnot retreat. He tried to glean something from De Galissonnière, who\ntalked with him several times, but the young captain would not depart\nfrom generalities. He invariably shut up, tight, when they approached\nany detail of the present military situation.",
        "A dark night came with much wind and threat of rain. Robert thought\nthat he and his fellow captives would have to ask the shelter of\ntents, but the rain passed farther to the west, though the heavy\ndarkness remained. He was glad, as the weather was now oppressively\nwarm, and he greatly preferred to sleep on a blanket in the open air.",
        "The night was somewhat advanced when he lay down. The other prisoners\nwere asleep already. He had not found any kindred minds among them,\nand, as they were apathetic, he had not talked with them much. Now,\nhe did not miss them at all as he lay on his blanket and watched the\nwavering lights of the camp. It was still quite dark, with a moaning\nwind, but his experience of weather told him that the chance of\nrain was gone. Far in the west, lightning flickered and low thunder\ngrumbled there now and then, but in the camp everything was dry. Owing\nto the warmth, the fires used for cooking had been permitted to burn\nout, and the whole army seemed at peace.",
        "Robert himself shared this feeling of rest. The storm, passing so far\naway, soothed and lulled him. It was pleasant to lie there, unharmed,\nand witness its course at a far point. He dozed a while, fell asleep,\nand awoke again in half an hour. Nothing had changed. There was still\nan occasional flicker of lightning and mutter of thunder and the\ndarkness remained heavy. He could dimly see the forms of his comrades\nlying on their blankets. Not one of them stirred. They slept heavily\nand he rather envied them. They had little imagination, and, when one\nwas in bad case, he was lucky to be without it.",
        "The figure lying nearest him he took to be that of the hunter, a\ntaciturn man who talked least of them all, and again Robert felt envy\nbecause he could lose all care so thoroughly and so easily in sleep.\nThe man was as still and unconcerned as one of the mountain peaks that\nlooked down upon them. He would imitate him, and although sleep might\nbe unwilling, he would conquer it. A resolute mind could triumph over\nanything.",
        "He shut his eyes and his will was so strong that he held them shut\na full ten minutes, although sleep did not come. When he opened them\nagain he thought that the hunter had moved a little. After all, the\nman was mortal, and had human emotions. He was not an absolute log.",
        "“Tilden!” he called–Tilden was the hunter’s name.",
        "But Tilden did not stir, nor did he respond in any way when he called\na second time. He had been mistaken. He had given the man too much\ncredit. He was really a log, a dull, apathetic fellow to whom the\nextraordinary conditions around them made no appeal. He would not\nspeak to him again as long as they were prisoners together, and,\nclosing his eyes anew, he resolutely wooed slumber once more.",
        "Robert’s hearing was not so wonderfully keen as Tayoga’s, but it was\nvery keen, nevertheless, and as he lay, eyes shut, something impinged\nupon the drums of his ears. It was faint, but it did not seem to be a\npart of the usual sounds of the night. His ear at once registered an\nalarm on his brain.",
        "His eyes opened. The man whom he had taken to be the hunter was\nbending over him, and, dark though it was, he distinctly saw the gleam\nof a knife in his hand. His first feeling, passing in a flash, was one\nof vague wonderment that anybody should menace him in such a manner,\nand then he saw the lowering face of Garay. He had been a fool to\nforget him. With a convulsive and powerful effort he threw his body to\none side, and, when the knife fell, the blade missed him by an inch.",
        "Then Robert sprang to his feet, but Garay, uttering an angry\nexclamation at his missed stroke, did not attempt another. Instead,\nagile as a cat, he ran lightly away, and disappeared in the darkness\nof the camp. Robert sat down, somewhat dazed. It had all been an\naffair of a minute, and it was hard for him to persuade himself that\nit was real. His comrades still slept soundly, and the camp seemed as\npeaceful as ever.",
        "For a time Robert could not decide what to do. He knew that he had\nbeen threatened by a formidable danger, and that instinct, more than\nanything else, had saved him. He was almost prepared to believe that\nTayoga’s Tododaho, looking down from his remote star, had intervened\nin his behalf.",
        "The question solved itself. Although he knew that Garay had made\na foul attempt upon his life he had no proof. His story would seem\nhighly improbable. Moreover, he was a prisoner, while Garay was one\nof the French. Nobody would believe his tale. He must keep quiet and\nwatch. He was glad to see that the night was now lightening. Garay\nwould not come back then, at least. But Robert was sure that he would\nrepeat the attack some time or other. Revenge was a powerful motive,\nand he undoubtedly had another as strong. He must guard against Garay\nwith all his five senses.",
        "The night continued to brighten. The lightning ceased to flicker,\nthe storm had blown itself out in the distance, and a fine moon and a\nmyriad of stars came out. Things in the camp became clearly visible,\nand, feeling that Garay would attempt nothing more at such a time,\nRobert closed his eyes again. He soon slept, and did not awaken until\nall the other prisoners were up.",
        "“Mr. Tilden,” he said to the hunter, “I offer you my sincere\napologies.”",
        "“Apologies,” said the hunter in surprise. “What for?”",
        "“Because I mistook a much worse man for you. You didn’t know anything\nabout it at the time, but I did it, and I’m sorry I wronged you so\nmuch, even in thought.”",
        "The hunter touched his forehead. Clearly the misfortunes of the young\nprisoner were weighing too heavily upon him. One must endure captivity\nbetter than that.",
        "“Don’t take it so hard, Mr. Lennox,” he said. “It’s not like being in\nthe hands of the Indians, and there is always the chance of escape.”",
        "De Galissonnière visited him again that morning, and Robert, true to\nhis resolution, said nothing of Garay. The captain did not speak of\nthe Anglo-American army, but Robert judged from his manner that he was\nhighly expectant. Surely, Abercrombie was about to advance, and\nthe retreat of Montcalm could not be more than a day away. De\nGalissonnière stayed only ten minutes, and then Robert was left to his\nown devices. He tried to talk to Tilden, but the hunter lapsed again\ninto an apathetic state, and, having little success, he fell back on\nhis own thoughts and what his eyes might behold.",
        "In the afternoon he saw Montcalm at some distance, talking with St.\nLuc and Bourlamaque, and then he saw a man whose appearance betokened\nhaste and anxiety approach them. Robert did not know it then, but it\nwas the able and daring French partisan, Langy, and he came out of the\nforest with vital news.",
        "Meanwhile Langy saluted Montcalm with the great respect that his\nsuccesses had won from all the French. When the Marquis turned his\nkeen eye upon him he knew at once that his message, whatever it might\nbe, was of supreme importance.",
        "“What is it, Monsieur Langy?”",
        "“A report on the movements of the enemy.”",
        "“Come to my tent and tell me of it fully, and do you, St. Luc and\nBourlamaque, come with me also. You should hear everything.”",
        "They went into the tent and all sat down. St. Luc’s eyes never left\nthe partisan, Langy. He saw that the man was full of his news, eager\nto tell it, and was impressed with its importance. He knew Langy even\nbetter than Montcalm did. Few were more skillful in the forest, and he\nhad a true sense of proportion that did not desert him under stress.\nHis eyes traveled over the partisan’s attire, and there his own great\nskill as a ranger told him much. His garments were disarranged. Burrs\nand one or two little twigs were clinging to them. Obviously he had\ncome far and in haste. The thoughts of St. Luc, and, in truth, the\nthoughts of all of them, went to the Anglo-American army.",
        "“Speak, Monsieur Langy,” said Montcalm. “I can see that you have come\nswiftly, and you would not come so without due cause.”",
        "“I wish to report to you, sir,” said Langy, “that the entire army of\nthe enemy is now embarked on the Lake of the Holy Sacrament, and is\nadvancing against us.”",
        "Montcalm’s eyes sparkled. His warlike soul leaped up at the thought of\nspeedy battle that was being offered. A flame was lighted also in\nSt. Luc’s blood, and Bourlamaque was no less eager. It was no lack of\nvalor and enterprise that caused the French to lose their colonies in\nNorth America.",
        "“You know this positively?” asked the commander-in-chief.",
        "“I have seen it with my own eyes.”",
        "“Tell it as you saw it.”",
        "“I lay in the woods above the lake with my men, and I saw the British\nand Americans go into their boats, a vast flock of them. They are all\nafloat on the lake at this moment, and are coming against us.”",
        "“Could you make a fair estimate of their numbers?”",
        "“I obtained the figures with much exactitude from one or two\nstragglers that we captured on the land. My eyes confirm these\nfigures. There are about seven thousand of the English regulars, and\nabout nine thousand of the American colonials.”",
        "“So many as that! Five to one!”",
        "“You tell us they are all in boats,” said St. Luc. “How many of these\nboats contain their artillery?”",
        "“They have not yet embarked the cannon. As nearly as we can gather,\nthe guns will not come until the army is at Ticonderoga.”",
        "“What?”",
        "“It is as I tell you,” replied Langy to St. Luc. “The guns cannot come\nup the lake until a day or two after the army is landed. Their\nforce is so great that they do not seem to think they will need the\nartillery.”",
        "St. Luc, his face glowing, turned to Montcalm.",
        "“Sir,” he said, “I made to you the prophecy that some chance, some\nglorious chance, would yet help us, and that chance has come. Their\nvery strength has betrayed them into an error that may prove fatal.\nDespising us, they give us our opportunity. No matter how great the\nodds, we can hold earthworks and abattis against them, unless they\nbring cannon, or, at least we may make a great attempt at it.”",
        "The swarthy face of Montcalm was illumined by the light from his eyes.",
        "“I verily believe that your gallant soul speaks truth, Chevalier de\nSt. Luc!” he exclaimed. “I said once that we would stand and I say it\nagain. We’ll put all to the hazard. Since they come without cannon\nwe do have our chance. Go, Langy, and take your needed rest. You have\nserved us well. And now we’ll have the others here and talk over our\npreparations.”",
        "The engineers Lotbiniére and Le Mercier were, as before, zealous\nfor battle at Ticonderoga, and their opinion counted for much with\nMontcalm. De Levis, held back by the vacillating Vaudreuil, had not\nyet come from Montreal, and the swiftest of the Canadian paddlers was\nsent down Lake Ticonderoga in a canoe to hurry him on. Then the entire\nbattalion of Berry went to work at once with spade and pick and ax\nto prepare a breastwork and abattis, stretching a line of defense in\nfront of the fort, and not using the fort itself.",
        "Robert saw the Frenchmen attack the trees with their axes and the\nearth with their spades, and he divined at once the news that\nLangy had brought. The Anglo-American army was advancing. His heart\nthrobbed. Victory and rescue were at hand.",
        "“Mr. Tilden,” he said to the hunter, “listen to the ring of the ax and\nthe thud of the spade!”",
        "“Aye, I hear ’em,” was the apathetic reply; “but they don’t interest\nme. I’m a prisoner.”",
        "“But it may mean that you won’t be a prisoner much longer. The French\nare fortifying, and they’ve gone to work with so much haste and energy\nthat it shows an imminent need. There’s only one conclusion to be\ndrawn from it. They’re expecting our army and a prompt attack.”",
        "Tilden began to show interest.",
        "“On my life, I think you’re right,” he said.",
        "And yet Montcalm changed his mind again at the last moment. Two\nveteran officers, Montguy and Bernès, pointed out to him that his\npresent position was dominated by the adjacent heights, and in order\nto escape that danger he resolved to retreat a little. He broke up his\ncamp late in the afternoon of the next day, part of the army fell back\nthrough the woods more than a mile, and the rest of it withdrew in\nboats on the lake to the same point.",
        "Robert and his comrades were carried with the army on land to the\nfort. There he became separated from the others, and remained in the\nrear, but luckily for his wishes, on a mount where he could see most\nthat was passing, though his chance of escape was as remote as ever.",
        "He stood on the rocky peninsula of Ticonderoga. Behind him the great\nlake, Champlain, stretched far into north and south. To the west the\nground sloped gently upward a half mile and then sank again. On each\nside of the ridge formed thus was low ground, and the ridge presented\nitself at once to the military eye as a line of defense. Hugues, one\nof his officers, had already recommended it to Montcalm, and men under\ntwo of his engineers, Desandrouin and Pontleroy, were now at work\nthere.",
        "The final line of defense was begun at dawn, and Robert, whom no one\ndisturbed, witnessed a scene of prodigious energy. The whole French\narmy threw itself heart and soul into the task. The men, hot under the\nJuly sun, threw aside their coats, and the officers, putting their own\nhands to the work, did likewise. There was a continuous ring of axes,\nand the air resounded with the crash of trees falling in hundreds and\nthousands.",
        "The tops and ends of the boughs were cut off the trees, the ends left\nthus were sharpened and the trees were piled upon one another with the\nsharp ends facing the enemy who was to come.",
        "Robert watched as these bristling rows grew to a height of at least\nnine feet, and then he saw the men build on the inner side platforms\non which they could stand and fire over the crest, without exposing\nanything except their heads. In front of the abattis more trees with\nsharpened boughs were spread for a wide space, the whole field with\nits stumps and trees, looking as if a mighty hurricane had swept over\nit.",
        "Robert was soldier enough to see what a formidable obstruction was\nbeing raised, but he thought the powerful artillery of the attacking\narmy would sweep it away or level it. He did not know that the big\nguns were being left behind. In truth, Langy’s first news that the\ncannon would not be embarked upon the lake was partly wrong. The\nloading of the cannon was delayed, but after the British and Americans\nreached their landing and began the march across country for the\nattack, the guns, although brought down the lake, were left behind as\nnot needed. But the French knew all these movements, and whether the\ncannon were left at one point or another, it was just the same to\nthem, so long as they were not used in the assault.",
        "Robert’s intense mortification that he should be compelled to lie idle\nand witness the efforts of his enemies returned, but no matter how he\nchafed he could see no way out of it. Then his absorption in what was\ngoing on about him made him forget his personal fortunes.",
        "The setting for the great drama was wild and picturesque in the\nextreme. On one side stretched the long, gleaming lake, a lake of\nwildness and beauty associated with so much of romance and peril in\nAmerican story. Over them towered the crest of the peak later known\nas Defiance. To the south and west was Lake George, the Iroquois\nAndiatarocte, that gem of the east, and, on all sides, save Champlain,\ncircled the forest, just beginning to wither under the fierce summer\nsun.",
        "The energy of the French did not diminish. Stronger and stronger grew\nabattis and breastwork, the whole becoming a formidable field over\nwhich men might charge to death. But Robert only smiled to himself.\nAbercrombie’s mighty array of cannon would smash everything and then\nthe brave infantry, charging through the gaps, would destroy the\nFrench army. The French, he knew, were brave and skillful, but their\ndoom was sure. Once St. Luc spoke to him. The chevalier had thrown off\nhis coat also, and he had swung an ax with the best.",
        "“I am sorry, Mr. Lennox,” he said, “that we have not had time to send\nyou away, but as you can see, our operations are somewhat hurried.\nChance put you here, and here you will have to stay until all is\nover.”",
        "“I see that you are expecting an army,” said Robert, “and I infer from\nall these preparations that it will soon be upon you.”",
        "“It is betraying no military secret to admit that it is even so.\nAbercrombie will soon be at hand.”",
        "“And I am surprised that you should await him. I judge that he has\nsufficient force to overwhelm you.”",
        "“We are never beaten before battle. The Marquis de Montcalm would not\nstay, unless he had a fair chance of success.”",
        "Robert was silent and St. Luc quickly went back to his work. All day\nthe men toiled, and when the sun went down, they were still at their\ntask. The ring of axes and the crash of falling trees resounded\nthrough the dark. Part of the soldiers put their kettles and pots on\nthe fires, but the others labored on. In the night came the valiant\nDe Levis with his men, and Montcalm gave him a heartfelt welcome. De\nLevis was a host in himself, and Montcalm felt that he was just in\ntime. He expected the battle on the morrow. His scouts told him that\nAbercrombie would be at hand, but without his artillery. The Marquis\nlooked at the formidable abattis, the rows and rows of trees,\npresenting their myriad of spiked ends, and hope was alive in his\nheart. He regretted once more the absence of the Indians who had been\nled away by the sulky Tandakora, but victory, won with their help,\ndemanded a fearful price, as he had learned at William Henry.",
        "Montcalm, St. Luc, De Levis, Bourlamaque, Lotbiniére and other trusted\nofficers held a consultation far in the night. An important event\nhad occurred already. A scouting force of French and Canadians under\nTrepezec and Langy had been trapped by rangers under Rogers and troops\nunder Fitch and Lyman. The French and Canadians were cut to pieces,\nbut in the battle the gallant young Lord Howe, the real leader of the\nAnglo-American army, had been killed. He had gone forward with the\nvanguard, exposing himself rashly, perhaps, and his life was the\nforfeit. Immediate confusion in the Anglo-American councils followed,\nand Montcalm and his lieutenants had noticed the lack of precision and\ndirectness.",
        "Robert did not see the French officers going to the council, but\nhe knew that the French army meant to stay. Even while the men were\ncutting down the trees he could not persuade himself wholly that\nMontcalm would fight there at Ticonderoga, but as the night advanced\nhis last faint doubt disappeared. He would certainly witness a great\nbattle on the morrow.",
        "He could not sleep. Every nerve in him seemed to be alive. One vivid\npicture after another floated before his mind. The lake behind him\ngrew dim. Before him were the camp fires of the French, the wooden\nwall, the dark line of the forest and hills, and the crest of Defiance\nlooking solemnly down on them. Although held firmly there, within\nlines which one could not pass, nobody seemed to take any notice of\nhim. He could rest or watch as he chose, and he had no choice but to\nwatch.",
        "He saw the French lie down on their arms, save for the numerous\nsentinels posted everywhere, and after a while, though most of the\nnight was gone, the ring of axes and the fall of trees ceased.\nThere was a hum of voices but that too died in time, and long after\nmidnight, with his back against a tree, he dozed a little while.",
        "He was awakened by a premonition, a warning out of the dark, and\nopening his eyes he saw Garay slinking near. He did not know whether\nthe spy meant another attempt upon his life, but, standing up, he\nstared at him intently. Garay shrank away and disappeared in the\nfurther ranges of the camp. Robert somehow was not afraid. The man\nwould not make such a trial again at so great a risk, and his mind\nturned back to its preoccupation, the great battle that was coming.",
        "Near morning he dozed again for an hour or so, but he awoke before the\nsummer dawn. All his faculties were alive, and his body attuned when\nhe saw the sun rise, bringing with it the momentous day.",
        "The French army rose with the sun, the drums beating the call to\nbattle. Montcalm stationed the battalions of Languedoc and La Sarre on\nthe left with Bourlamaque to command them, on the right De Levis led\nthe battalions of Béarn, Guienne and La Reine. Montcalm himself stood\nwith the battalion of Royal Roussillon in the center, and St. Luc was\nby his side. Volunteers held the sunken ground between the breastwork\nand the outlet of Lake George, a strong force of regulars and\nCanadians was on the side of Lake Champlain under the guns of the fort\nthere. Then, having taken their places, all the parts of the army went\nto work again, strengthening the defenses with ax and spade, improving\nevery moment that might be left.",
        "All thought of escape left Robert’s mind in the mighty and thrilling\ndrama that was about to be played before him. Once more he stared at\nthe long line of the lake, and then his whole attention was for the\ncircling forest, and the hills. That was where the army of his country\nlay. Nothing was to be expected from the lake. Victory would come\nfrom the woods, and he looked so long at the trees that they blurred\ntogether into one mass. He knew that the English and Americans were\nnear, but just how near he could not gather from those around him.",
        "He brushed his eyes to clear them, and continued to study the forest.\nThe sun, great and brilliant, was flooding it with light, gilding the\nslopes and crests of Defiance, and tinging the green of the leaves\nwith gold. Nothing stirred there. The wilderness seemed silent, as if\nmen never fought in its depths. Time went slowly on. After all,\nthe army might not advance to the attack that day. If so, his\ndisappointment would be bitter. He wanted a great victory, and he\nwanted it at once.",
        "His eyes suddenly caught a gleam on the crest of Defiance. A bit\nof red flashed among the trees. He thought it was the uniform of\na British soldier, and his heart beat hard. The army was surely\nadvancing, the attack would be made, and the victory would be won that\nday, not on the morrow nor next week, but before the sun set.",
        "The blood pounded in his temples. He looked at the French. They,\ntoo, had seen the scarlet gleam on Defiance and they were watching.\nMontcalm and St. Luc began to talk together earnestly. De Levis and\nBourlamaque walked back and forth among their troops, but their gaze\nwas upon the crest. The men lay down ax and spade for the time, and\nreached for their arms. Robert saw the sunlight glittering on musket\nand bayonet, and once more he thrilled at the thought of the great\ndrama on which the curtain was now rising.",
        "Another scarlet patch appeared on the crest and then more. He knew\nthat the scouts and skirmishers were there, doubtless in strong force.\nIt was likely that the rangers, who would be in forest green, were\nmore numerous than the English, and the attack could not now be far\naway. A sharp crack, a puff of white smoke on the hill, and the first\nshot of Ticonderoga was fired. Then came a volley, but the French made\nno reply. None of the bullets had reached them. Robert did not know\nit then, but the gleam came from the red blankets of Iroquois Indians,\nthe allies of the English, and not from English uniforms. They kept up\na vigorous but harmless fire for a short while, and then drew off.",
        "Silence descended once more on the forest, and Robert was puzzled. It\ncould not be possible that this was to be the only attack. The smoke\nof the rifles was already drifting away from the crest, gone like\nsummer vapor. The French were returning to their work with ax and\nspade. The forest covered and enclosed everything. No sound came from\nit. Montcalm and St. Luc, walking up and down, began to talk together\nagain. They looked no longer toward the crest of Defiance, but watched\nthe southern wilderness.",
        "The work with the ax increased. Montcalm had no mind to lose the\nprecious hours. More trees fell fast, and they were added to the\nformidable works. The sun grew hotter and poured down sheaves of fiery\nrays, but the toilers disregarded it, swinging the axes with muscles\nthat took no note of weariness. Robert thought the morning would\nlast forever. An hour before noon De Galissonnière was passing, and,\nnoticing him sitting on a low mound, he said:",
        "“I did not know what had become of you, Mr. Lennox, but I see that\nyou, like ourselves, await the battle.”",
        "“So I do,” said Robert as lightly as he could, “but it seems to me\nthat it’s somewhat delayed.”",
        "“Not our fault, I assure you. Perhaps you didn’t think so earlier, but\nyou see we’re willing to fight, no matter how great the odds.”",
        "“I admit it. The Marquis de Montcalm has his courage–perhaps too\nmuch.”",
        "De Galissonnière glanced at the strong works, and his smile was\nconfident, but he merely said:",
        "“It is for the future to tell.”",
        "Then he went on, and Robert hoped that whatever happened the battle\nwould spare the young Frenchman.",
        "Up went the sun toward the zenith. A light wind rustled the foliage.\nNoon was near, and he began to wonder anew what had become of the\nadvancing army. Suddenly, the echo of a crash came out of the forest\nin front. He stood erect, listening intently, and the sound rose\nagain, but it was not an echo now. It was real, and he knew that the\nbattle was at hand.",
        "The crashes became continuous. Mingled with them were shouts, and\na cloud of smoke began to float above the trees. The French fired a\ncannon as a signal, and, before the echoes of its report rolled away,\nevery man dropped ax or spade, and was in his place, weapon in hand.\nThe noise of the firing in front grew fast. Montcalm’s scouts and\npickets were driven in, and the soldiers of the advancing army began\nto show among the trees. The French batteries opened. The roar in\nRobert’s ear was terrific, but he stood at his utmost height in order\nthat he might see the assault. His eyes caught the gleam of uniforms\nand the flash of sunlight on bayonet and rifle. He knew now that his\nown people, dauntless and tenacious, were coming. He did not know\nthat they had left their artillery behind, and that they expected to\ndestroy the French army with bayonet and rifle and musket.",
        "The fire from the French barrier increased in volume. Its crash beat\nheavily and continuously on the drums of Robert’s ears. A deadly sleet\nwas beating upon the advancing English and Americans. Already their\ndead were heaping up in rows. Montcalm’s men showed their heads only\nabove their works, their bodies were sheltered by the logs and they\nfired and fired into the charging masses until the barrels of rifles\nand muskets grew too hot for them to hold. Meanwhile they shouted with\nall their might: “Vive la France! Vive notre General! Vive le Roi!\"\nand St. Luc, who stood always with Montcalm, hummed softly and under\nhis breath: “Hier, sur le pont d’Avignon, j’ai oui chanter la belle.”",
        "“It goes well,” he said to Montcalm.",
        "“Aye, a fair beginning,” replied the Marquis.",
        "Fire ran through French veins. No cannon balls were coming from the\nenemy to sweep down their defenses. Bullets from rifle and musket were\nbeating in vain on their wooden wall, and before them came the foe, a\nvast, converging mass, a target that no one could miss. They were far\nfrom their own land, deep in the great North American wilderness, but\nas they saw it, they fought for the honor and glory of France, and to\nkeep what was hers. They redoubled their shouts and fired faster and\nfaster. A great cloud of smoke rose over the clearing and the forest,\nbut through it the attacking army always advanced, a hedge of bayonets\nleading.",
        "Robert saw everything clearly. His heart sank for a moment, and then\nleaped up again. Many of his own had fallen, but a great red curve was\nadvancing. It was the British regulars, the best troops in the charge\nthat Europe could furnish, and they would surely carry the wooden\nwall. As far as he could see, in front and to left and right, their\nbayonets flashed in the sun, and a cry of admiration sprang to his\nlips. Forward they came, their line even and beautiful, and then the\ntempest beat upon them. The entire French fire was concentrated upon\nthe concave red lines. The batteries poured grape shot upon them and\na sleet of lead cut through flesh and bone. Gaps were torn in their\nranks, but the others closed up, and came on, the American Colonials\non their flanks charging as bravely.",
        "Robert suddenly remembered a vision of his, vague and fleeting then,\nbut very real now. He was standing here at Ticonderoga, looking at\nthe battle as it passed before him, and now it was no vision, but the\ntruth. Had Tayoga’s Manitou opened the future to him for a moment?\nThen the memory was gone and the terrific drama of the present claimed\nhis whole mind.",
        "The red lines were not stopped. In the face of awful losses they were\nstill coming. They were among the trees where the men were entangled\nwith the boughs or ran upon the wooden spikes. Often they tripped and\nfell, but rising they returned to the charge, offering their breasts\nto the deadly storm that never diminished for an instant.",
        "Robert walked back and forth in his little space. Every nerve was on\nedge. The smoke of the firing was in eye, throat and nostril, and\nhis brain was hot. But confidence was again supreme. “They’ll come!\nThey’ll come! Nothing can stop them!” he kept repeating to himself.",
        "Now the Colonials on the flank pressed forward, and they also advanced\nthrough the lines of the regulars in front and charged with them.\nTogether British and Americans climbed over the mass of fallen trees\nin face of the terrible fire, and reached the wooden wall itself,\nwhere the sleet beat directly upon their faces. For a long distance\nbehind them, their dead and wounded lay in hundreds and hundreds.",
        "Many of them tried to scale the barrier, but were beaten back. Now\nMontcalm, St. Luc, De Levis, Bourlamaque and all the French leaders\nmade their mightiest efforts. The eye of the French commander swept\nthe field. He neglected nothing. Never was a man better served by his\nlieutenants. St. Luc was at every threatened point, encouraging with\nvoice and example. Bourlamaque received a dangerous wound, but refused\nto quit the field. Bougainville was hit, but his hurt was less severe,\nand he took no notice of it, two bullets pierced the hat of De Levis,\nSt. Luc took a half dozen through his clothes and his body was grazed\nthree times, but his gay and warlike spirit mounted steadily, and he\nhummed his little French air over and over again.",
        "More British and Americans pressed to the wooden wall. The new Black\nWatch, stalwart Scotchmen, bagpipes playing, charged over everything.\nTwo British columns made a powerful and tremendous attack upon the\nFrench right, where stood the valiant battalions of Béarn and Guienne.\nIt seemed, for a while, that they might overwhelm everything. They\nwere against the barrier itself, and were firing into the defense.\nMontcalm rushed to the spot with all the reserves he could muster. St.\nLuc sprang among the men and shouted to them to increase their fire.\nThis point became the center of the battle, and its full fury was\nconcentrated there. A mass of Highlanders, tearing at the wooden wall,\nrefused to give back. Though they fell fast, a captain climbed up the\nbarrier. Officers and men followed him. They stood a moment on the\ncrest as if to poise themselves, and then leaped down among the\nFrench, where they were killed. Those who stood on the other side were\nswept by a hurricane of fire, and at last they yielded slowly.",
        "Robert saw all, and he was seized with a great horror. The army was\nnot crashing over everything. Those who entered the French works died\nthere. The wooden wall held. Nowhere was the line of defense broken.\nBoats loaded with troops coming down the outlet of Lake George to\nturn the French left were repelled by the muskets of the Canadian\nvolunteers. Some of the boats were sunk, and the soldiers struggled in\nthe water, as cannon balls and bullets beat upon them.",
        "His view of the field was blurred, for a while, by the smoke from\nso much firing, which floated in thickening clouds over all the\nopen spaces and the edges of the forest. It produced curious optical\nillusions. The French loomed through it, increased fourfold in\nnumbers, every individual man magnified in size. He saw them lurid and\ngigantic, pulling the triggers of their rifles or muskets, or\nworking the batteries. The cannon also grew from twelve-pounders or\neighteen-pounders into guns three or four times as large, and many\nstood where none had stood before.",
        "The smoke continued to inflame his brain also, and it made him pass\nthrough great alternations of hope and fear. Now the army was going to\nsweep over the wooden wall in spite of everything. With sheer weight\nand bravery it would crush the French and take Ticonderoga. It must\nbe. Because he wanted it to be, it was going to be. Then he passed\nto the other extreme. When one of the charges spent itself at the\nbarrier, sending perhaps a few men over it, like foam from a wave that\nhas reached its crest, his heart sank to the depths, and he was sure\nthe British and Americans could not come again. Mortal men would\nnot offer themselves so often to slaughter. If the firing died for a\nlittle space he was in deep despair, but his soul leaped up again as\nthe charge came anew. It was certainly victory this time. Hope\ncould not be crushed in him. His vivid fancy made him hear above the\ntriumphant shouts of the French the deep cheers of the advancing army,\nthe beating of drums and the playing of invisible bands.",
        "All the time, whether in attack or retreat, the smoke continued to\nincrease and to inflame and excite. It was like a gas, its taste was\nacrid and bitter as death. Robert coughed and tried to blow it away,\nbut it returned in waves heavier than ever, and then he ceased to\nfight against it.",
        "The British and American troops came again and again to the attack,\ntheir officers leading them on. Never had they shown greater courage\nor more willingness to die. When the first lines were cut down at the\nbarrier, others took their places. They charged into the vast mass of\nfallen trees and against the spikes. Blinded by the smoke of so much\nfiring, they nevertheless kept their faces toward the enemy and sought\nto see him. The fierce cheering of the French merely encouraged them\nto new attempts.",
        "The battle went on for hours. It seemed days to Robert. Mass after\nmass of British and Colonials continued to charge upon the wooden\nwall, always to be broken down by the French fire, leaving heaps of\ntheir dead among those logs and boughs and on that bristling array of\nspikes. At last they advanced no more, twilight came over the field,\nthe terrible fire that had raged since noon died, and the sun set upon\nthe greatest military triumph ever won by France in the New World.",
        "Twilight gathered over the most sanguinary field America had yet seen.\nIn the east the dark was already at hand, but in the west the light\nfrom the sunken sun yet lingered, casting a scarlet glow alike over\nthe fallen and the triumphant faces of the victors. Within the works\nwhere the French had stood fires were lighted, and everything there\nwas brilliant, but outside, where so much valor had been wasted,\nthe shadows that seemed to creep out of the illimitable forest grew\nthicker and thicker.",
        "The wind moaned incessantly among the leaves, and the persistent smoke\nthat had been so bitter in the throat and nostrils of Robert still\nhung in great clouds that the wind moved but little. From the woods\ncame long, fierce howls. The wolves, no longer frightened by the crash\nof cannon and muskets, were coming, and under cover of bushes and\nfloating smoke, they crept nearer and nearer.",
        "Robert sat a long time, bewildered, stunned. The incredible had\nhappened. He had seen it with his own eyes, and yet it was hard to\nbelieve that it was true. The great Anglo-American army had been\nbeaten by a French force far less in numbers. Rather, it had beaten\nitself. That neglect to bring up the cannon had proved fatal, and the\nfinest force yet gathered on the soil of North America had been cut\nto pieces. A prodigious opportunity had been lost by a commander who\nstayed a mile and a half in the rear, while his valiant men charged to\ncertain death.",
        "Young Lennox walked stiffly a few steps. No one paid any attention to\nhim. In the dark, and amid the joyous excitement of the defenders, he\nmight have been taken for a Frenchman. But he made no attempt,\nthen, to escape. No such thought was in his mind for the moment. His\namazement gave way to horror. He wanted to see what was beyond the\nwooden wall where he knew the dead and wounded lay, piled deep among\nthe logs and sharpened boughs. Unbelievable it was, but it was true.\nHis own eyes had seen and his own ears had heard. He listened to the\ntriumphant shouts of the French, and his soul sank within him.",
        "A few shots came from the forest now and then, but the great army had\nvanished, save for its fallen. Montcalm, still cautious, relaxing no\nvigilance, fearing that the enemy would yet come back with his cannon,\nwalked among his troops and gave them thanks in person. Beer and wine\nin abundance, and food were served to them. Fires were lighted and the\nfield that they had defended was to be their camp. Many scouts were\nsent into the forest to see what had become of the opposing army. Most\nof the soldiers, after eating and drinking, threw themselves upon the\nground and slept, but it was long before the leader and any of his\nlieutenants closed their eyes. Although he felt a mighty joy over his\ngreat victory of the day, Montcalm was still a prey to anxieties. His\nown force, triumphant though it might be, was small. The enemy might\ncome again on the morrow with nearly four to one, and, if he brought\nhis cannon with him, he could take Ticonderoga, despite the great\nlosses he had suffered already. Once more he talked with St. Luc, whom\nhe trusted implicitly.",
        "The Chevalier did not believe a second attack would be made, and his\nbelief was so strong it amounted to a conviction.",
        "“The same mind,” he said, “that sent their army against us without\nartillery, will now go to the other extreme. Having deemed us\nnegligible it will think us invincible.”",
        "St. Luc’s logic was correct. The French passed the night in peace, and\nthe next morning, when De Levis went out with a strong party to look\nfor the enemy he found that he was gone, and that in his haste he\nhad left behind vast quantities of food and other supplies which the\nFrench eagerly seized. Montcalm that day, full of pride, caused a\ngreat cross to be erected on his victorious field of battle and upon\nit he wrote in Latin:",
        "  “Quid dux? quid miles? quid strata ingentia ligna?\n  En Signum! en victor! Deus hic, Deus ipse triumphat.”",
        "Which a great American writer has translated into:",
        "  “Soldier and chief and ramparts’ strength are nought;\n  Behold the conquering cross! ’Tis God the triumph wrought.”",
        "But for Robert the night that closed down was the blackest he had ever\nknown. It had never occurred to him that Abercrombie’s army could be\ndefeated. Confident in its overwhelming numbers, he had believed that\nit would easily sweep away the French and take Ticonderoga. The skill\nand valor of Montcalm, St. Luc, De Levis and the others, no matter how\nskillful and valiant they might be, could avail nothing, and, after\nTiconderoga, it would be a mere question of time until Crown Point\nfell too. And after that would come Quebec and the conquest of Canada.",
        "Now, when his spirits had soared so high, the fall was correspondingly\nlow. His sensitive mind, upon which events always painted themselves\nwith such vividness, reflected only the darkest pictures. He saw the\ntriumphant advance of the French, the Indians laying waste the whole\nof New York Province, and the enemy at the gates of New York itself.",
        "The night itself was a perfect reproduction of his own mind. He saw\nthrough his spirits as through a glass. The dusk was thick, heavy,\nit was noisome, it had a quality that was almost ponderable, it was\nunpleasant to eye and nostril, he tasted and breathed the smoke that\nwas shot through it, and he felt a sickening of the soul. He heard a\nwind moaning through the forest, and it was to him a dirge, the lament\nof those who had fallen.",
        "He knew there had been no lack of bravery on the part of his own.\nAfter a while he took some consolation in that fact. British and\nAmericans had come to the attack long after hope of success was gone.\nThey had not known how to win, but never had men known better how to\ndie. Such valor would march to triumph in the end.",
        "He lay awake almost the whole night, and he did not expect Abercrombie\nto advance again. Somehow he had the feeling that the play, so far as\nthis particular drama was concerned, was played out. The blow was\nso heavy that he was in a dull and apathetic state from which he was\nstirred only once in the evening, and that was when two Frenchmen\npassed near him, escorting a prisoner of whose face he caught a\nglimpse in the firelight. He started forward, exclaiming:",
        "“Charteris!\"[1]",
        "The young man, tall, handsome and firm of feature, although a\ncaptive, turned.",
        "“Who called me?” he asked.",
        "“It is I, Robert Lennox,” said Robert. “I knew you in New York!”",
        "“Aye, Mr. Lennox. I recognize you now. We meet again, after so long\na time. I could have preferred the meeting to be elsewhere and under\nother circumstances, but it is something to know that you are alive.”",
        "They shook hands with great friendliness and the Frenchmen, who were\nguarding Charteris, waited patiently.",
        "“May our next meeting be under brighter omens,” said Robert.",
        "“I think it will be,” said Charteris confidently.",
        "Then he went on. It was a long time before they were to see each other\nagain, and the drama that was to bring them face to face once more was\ndestined to be as thrilling as that at Ticonderoga.",
        "The next night came heavy and dark, and Robert, who continued to be\ntreated with singular forbearance, wandered toward Lake Champlain,\nwhich lay pale and shadowy under the thick dusk. No one stopped him.\nThe sentinels seemed to have business elsewhere, and suddenly he\nremembered his old threat to escape. Hope returned to a mind that had\nbeen stunned for a time, and it came back vivid and strong. Then hope\nsank down again, when a figure issued from the dusk, and stood before\nhim. It was St. Luc.",
        "“Mr. Lennox,” said the Chevalier, “what are you doing here?”",
        "“Merely wandering about,” replied Robert. “I’m a prisoner, as you\nknow, but no one is bothering about me, which I take to be natural\nwhen the echoes of so great a battle have scarcely yet died.”",
        "St. Luc looked at him keenly and Robert met his gaze. He could not\nread the eye of the Chevalier.",
        "“You have been a prisoner of ours once before, but you escaped,” said\nthe Chevalier. “It seems that you are a hard lad to hold.”",
        "“But then I had the help of the greatest trailer and forest runner in\nthe world, my staunch friend, Tayoga, the Onondaga.”",
        "“If he rescued you once he will probably try to do it again, and the\ngreat hunter, Willet, is likely to be with him. I suppose you were\nplanning a few moments ago to escape along the shore of the lake.”",
        "“I might have been, but I see now that it is too late.”",
        "“Too late is a phrase that should be seldom used by youth.”",
        "Robert tried once again to read the Chevalier’s eye, but St. Luc’s\nlook contained the old enigma.",
        "“I admit,” said young Lennox, “that I thought I might find an open\nplace in your line. It was only a possible chance.”",
        "St. Luc shrugged his shoulders, and looked at the darkness that lay\nbefore them like a great black blanket.",
        "“There is much yet to be done by us at Ticonderoga,” he said. “Perhaps\nit is true that a possible chance for you to escape does exist, but\nmy duties are too important for me to concern myself about guarding a\nsingle prisoner.”",
        "His figure vanished. He was gone without noise, and Robert stared at\nthe place where he had been. Then the hope of escape came back, more\nvivid and more powerful than ever. “Too late,” was a phrase that\nshould not be known to youth. St. Luc was right. He walked straight\nahead. No sentinel barred the way. Presently the lake, still and\nluminous, stretched across his path, and, darting into the bushes\nalong its edge, he ran for a long time. Then he sank down and looked\nback. He saw dimly the lights of the camp, but he heard no sound of\npursuit.",
        "Rising, he began a great curve about Ticonderoga, intending to seek\nhis own army, which he knew could not yet be far away. Once he heard\nlight footsteps and hid deep in the bush. From his covert he saw a\nband of warriors at least twenty in number go by, their lean, sinewy\nfigures showing faintly in the dusk. Their faces were turned toward\nthe south and he shuddered. Already they were beginning to raid the\nborder. He knew that they had taken little or no part in the battle at\nTiconderoga, but now the great success of the French would bring them\nflocking back to Montcalm’s banner, and they would rush like wolves\nupon those whom they thought defenseless, hoping for more slaughters\nlike that of William Henry.",
        "Tandakora would not neglect such a glowing opportunity for scalps. His\nsavage spirit would incite the warriors to attempts yet greater, and\nRobert looked closely at the dusky line, thinking for a moment that\nhe might be there. But he did not see his gigantic figure and the\nwarriors flitted on, gone like shadows in the darkness. Then the\nfugitive youth resumed his own flight.",
        "Far in the night Robert sank down in a state of exhaustion. It was\na physical and mental collapse, coming with great suddenness, but he\nrecognized it for what it was, the natural consequence flowing from\na period of such excessive strain. His emotions throughout the great\nbattle had been tense and violent, and they had been hardly less so in\nthe time that followed and in the course of the events that led to his\nescape. And knowing, he forced himself to do what was necessary.",
        "He lay down in the shelter of dense bushes, and kept himself perfectly\nquiet for a long time. He would not allow hand or foot to move. His\nweary heart at last began to beat with regularity, the blood ceased to\npound in his temples, and his nerves grew steadier. He dozed a little,\nor at least passed into a state that was midway between wakefulness\nand oblivion. Then the terrible battle was fought once more before\nhim. Again he heard the crash and roar of the French fire, again\nhe saw British and Americans coming forward in indomitable masses,\noffering themselves to death, once again he saw them tangled among the\nlogs and sharpened boughs, and then mowed down at the wooden wall.",
        "He roused himself and passed his hands over his eyes to shut away that\nvision of the stricken field and the vivid reminder of his terrible\ndisappointment. The picture was still as fresh as the reality and it\nsent shudders through him every time he saw it. He would keep it from\nhis sight whenever he could, lest he grow too morbid.",
        "He rose and started once more toward the south, but the forest became\nmore dense and tangled and the country rougher. In his weakened state\nhe was not able to think with his usual clearness and precision, and\nhe lost the sense of direction. He began to wander about aimlessly,\nand at last he stopped almost in despair.",
        "He was in a desperate plight. He was unarmed, and a man alone and\nwithout weapons in the wilderness was usually as good as lost. He\nlooked around, trying to study the points of the compass. The night\nwas not dark. Trees and bushes stood up distinctly, and on a bough not\nfar away, his eyes suddenly caught a flash of blue.",
        "The flash was made by a small, glossy bird that wavered on a bough,\nand he was about to turn away, taking no further notice of it, when\nthe bird flew slowly before him and in a direction which he now knew\nled straight toward the south. He remembered. Back to his mind rushed\nan earlier escape, and how he had followed the flight of a bird to\nsafety. Had Tayoga’s Manitou intervened again in his favor? Was it\nchance? Or did he in a dazed state imagine that he saw what he did not\nsee?",
        "The bird, an azure flash, flew on before him, and hope flowing in an\ninvincible tide in his veins, he followed. He was in continual fear\nlest the blue flame fade away, but on he went, over hills and across\nvalleys and brooks, and it was always just before him. He had been\nworn and weary before, but now he felt strong and active. Courage\nrose steadily in his veins, and he had no doubt that he would reach\nfriends.",
        "Near dawn the bird suddenly disappeared among the leaves. Robert\nstopped and heard a light foot-step in the bushes. Being apprehensive\nlest he be re-taken, he shrank away and then stopped. He listened a\nwhile, and the sound not being repeated, he hoped that he had been\nmistaken, but a voice called suddenly from a bush not ten feet away:",
        "“Come, Dagaeoga! The Great Bear and I await you. Tododaho, watching on\nhis star, has sent us into your path.”",
        "Robert, uttering a joyful cry, sprang forward, and the Onondaga and\nWillet, rising from the thicket, greeted him with the utmost warmth.",
        "“I knew we’d find you again,” said Willet “How did you manage to\nescape?”",
        "“A way seemed to open for me,” replied Robert. “The last man I saw in\nthe French camp was St. Luc. After that I met no sentinel, although I\npassed where a sentinel would stand.”",
        "“Ah!” said Willet.",
        "They gave him food, and after sunrise they started toward the south.\nRobert told how he had seen the great battle and the French victory.",
        "“Tayoga, Black Rifle, Grosvenor and I were in the attack,” said\nWillet, “but we went through it without a scratch. No troops ever\nfought more bravely than ours. The defeat was the fault of the\ncommander, not theirs. But we’ll put behind us the battle lost and\nthink of the battle yet to be won.”",
        "“So we will,” said Robert, as he looked around at the great curving\nforest, its deep green tinted with the light brown of summer. It was a\nfriendly forest now. It no longer had the aspect of the night before,\nwhen the wolves, their jaws slavering in anticipation, howled in its\nthickets. Rabbits sprang up as they passed, but the little creatures\nof the wild did not seem to be afraid. They did not run away. Instead,\nthey crouched under the bushes, and gazed with mild eyes at the human\nbeings who made no threats. A deer, drinking at the edge of a brook,\nraised its head a little and then continued to drink. Birds sang in\nthe dewy dawn with uncommon freshness and sweetness. The whole world\nwas renewed.",
        "Creature, as he was, of his moods, Robert’s spirits soared again at\nhis meeting with Tayoga and Willet, those staunch friends of his,\nbound to him by such strong ties and so many dangers shared. The past\nwas the past, Ticonderoga was a defeat, a great defeat, when a victory\nhad been expected, but it was not irreparable. Hope sang in his\nheart and his face flushed in the dawn. The Onondaga, looking at him,\nsmiled.",
        "“Dagaeoga already looks to the future,” he said.",
        "“So I do,” replied Robert with enthusiasm. “Why shouldn’t I? The night\njust passed has favored me. I escaped. I met you and Dave, and it’s a\nglorious morning.”",
        "The sun was rising in a splendid sea of color, tinting the woods with\nred and gold. Never had the wilderness looked more beautiful to him.\nHe turned his face in the direction of Ticonderoga.",
        "“We’ll come back,” he said, his heart full of courage, “and we’ll yet\nwin the victory, even to the taking of Quebec.”",
        "“So we will,” said the hunter.",
        "“Aye, Stadacona itself will fall,” said Tayoga.",
        "Refreshed and strong, they plunged anew into the forest, traveling\nswiftly toward the south.",
