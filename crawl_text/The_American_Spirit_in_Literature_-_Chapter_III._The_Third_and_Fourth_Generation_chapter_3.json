        "When the eighteenth century opened, many signs of change were in\nthe air. The third generation of native-born Americans was\nbecoming secularized. The theocracy of New England had failed. In\nthe height of the tragic folly over the supposed “witchcraft” in\nSalem, Increase Mather and his son Cotton had held up the hands\nof the judges in their implacable work. But before five years had\npassed, Judge Sewall does public penance in church for his share\nof the awful blunder, desiring “to take the shame and blame of\nit.” Robert Calef’s cool pamphlet exposing the weakness of the\nprosecutors’ case is indeed burned by Increase Mather in the\nHarvard Yard, but the liberal party are soon to force Mather from\nthe Presidency and to refuse that office to his son. In the town\nof Boston, once hermetically sealed against heresy, there are\nBaptist and Episcopal churches–and a dancing-master. Young\nBenjamin Franklin, born in 1706, professes a high respect for the\nMathers, but he does not go to church, “Sunday being my studying\nday,” and neither the clerical nor the secular arm of Boston is\nlong enough and strong enough to compel that industrious\napprentice into piety.",
        "If such was the state of New England, the laxity of New York and\nVirginia needs little evidence. Contemporary travelers found the\nNew Yorkers singularly attached to the things of this present\nworld. Philadelphia was prosperous and therewith content.\nVirginia was a paradise with no forbidden fruit. Hugh Jones,\nwriting of it in 1724, considers North Carolina “the refuge of\nrunaways,” and South Carolina “the delight of buccaneers and\npirates,” but Virginia “the happy retreat of true Britons and\ntrue Churchmen.” Unluckily these Virginians, well nourished “by\nthe plenty of the country,” have “contemptible notions of\nEngland!” We shall hear from them again. In the meantime the\nwitty William Byrd of Westover describes for us his amusing\nsurvey of the Dismal Swamp, and his excursions into North\nCarolina and to Governor Spotswood’s iron mines, where he reads\naloud to the Widow Fleming, on a rainy autumn day, three acts of\nthe “Beggars’ Opera,” just over from London. So runs the world\naway, south of the Potomac. Thackeray paints it once for all, no\ndoubt, in the opening chapters of “The Virginians.”",
        "To discover any ambitious literary effort in this period, we must\nturn northward again. In the middle colonies, and especially in\nPhiladelphia, which had now outgrown Boston in population, there\nwas a quickened interest in education and science. But the New\nEnglanders were still the chief makers of books. Three great\nnames will sufficiently represent the age: Cotton Mather, a\nprodigy of learning whose eyes turn back fondly to the provincial\npast; Jonathan Edwards, perhaps the most consummate intellect of\nthe eighteenth century; and Benjamin Franklin, certainly the most\nperfect exponent of its many-sided life.",
        "When Cotton Mather was graduated from Harvard in 1678, in his\nsixteenth year, he was publicly complimented by President Oakes,\nin fulsome Latin, as the grandson of Richard Mather and John\nCotton. This atmosphere of flattery, this consciousness of\ncontinuing in his own person the famous local dynasty, surrounded\nand sustained him to the end. He had a less commanding\npersonality than his father Increase. His nervous sensibility was\nexcessive. His natural vanity was never subdued, though it was\noften chastened by trial and bitter disappointment. But, like his\nfather, he was an omnivorous reader and a facile producer of\nbooks, carrying daily such burdens of mental and spiritual\nexcitement as would have crushed a normal man. Increase Mather\npublished some one hundred and fifty books and pamphlets: Cotton\nMather not less than four hundred. The Rev. John Norton, in his\nsketch of John Cotton, remarks that “the hen, which brings not\nforth without uncessant sitting night and day, is an apt emblem\nof students.” Certainly the hen is an apt emblem of the\n“uncessant” sitter, the credulous scratcher, the fussy cackler\nwho produced the “Magnalia.”",
        "Yet he had certain elements of greatness. His tribal loyalty was\nperfect. His ascetic devotion to his conception of religious\ntruth was absolute. His Diary, which has recently been published\nin full, records his concern for the chief political events in\nEurope in his day, no less than his brooding solicitude for the\nwelfare of his townspeople, and his agony of spirit over the\nlapses of his wayward eldest son. A “sincere” man, then, as\nCarlyle would say, at bottom; but overlaid with such “Jewish old\nclothes,” such professional robings and personal plumage as makes\nit difficult, save in the revealing “Diary,” to see the man\nhimself.",
        "The “Magnalia Christi Americana,” treating the history of New\nEngland from 1620 to 1698, was published in a tall London folio\nof nearly 800 pages in 1702. It is divided into seven books, and\nproceeds, by methods entirely unique, to tell of Pilgrim and\nPuritan divines and governors, of Harvard College, of the\nchurches of New England, of marvelous events, of Indian wars; and\nin general to justify, as only a member of the Mather dynasty\ncould justify, the ways of God to Boston men. Hawthorne and\nWhittier, Longfellow and Lowell knew this book well and found\nmuch honey in the vast carcass. To have had four such readers and\na biographer like Barrett Wendell must be gratifying to Cotton\nMather in Paradise.",
        "The “Diary” of Mather’s fellow-townsman Judge Samuel Sewall has\nbeen read more generally in recent years than anything written by\nMather himself. It was begun in 1673, nine years earlier than the\nfirst entry in Mather’s “Diary,” and it ends in 1729, while\nMather’s closes in 1724. As a picture of everyday happenings in\nNew England, Sewall’s “Diary” is as far superior to Mather’s as\nPepys’s “Diary” is to George Fox’s “Journal” in painting the\nEngland of the Restoration. Samuel Sewall was an admirably solid\nfigure, keen, forceful, honest. Most readers of his “Diary\"\nbelieve that he really was in luck when he was rejected by the\nWidow Winthrop on that fateful November day when his eye\nnoted–in spite of his infatuation–that “her dress was not so\nclean as sometime it had been. Jehovah Jireh!”",
        "One pictures Cotton Mather as looking instinctively backward to\nthe Heroic Age of New England with pious nervous exaltation, and\nSamuel Sewall as doing the day’s work uprightly without taking\nanxious thought of either past or future. But Jonathan Edwards is\nset apart from these and other men. He is a lonely seeker after\nspiritual perfection, in quest of that city “far on the world’s\nrim,” as Masefield says of it, the city whose builder and maker\nis God.",
        "The story of Edwards’s career has the simplicity and dignity of\ntragedy. Born in a parsonage in the quiet Connecticut valley in\n1703–the year of John Wesley’s birth–he is writing at the age\nof ten to disprove the doctrine of the materiality of the soul.\nAt twelve he is studying “the wondrous way of the working of the\nspider,” with a precision and enthusiasm which would have made\nhim a great naturalist. At fourteen he begins his notes on “The\nMind” and on “Natural Science.” He is graduated from Yale in\n1720, studies theology, and at twenty-four becomes the colleague\nof his famous grandfather, Solomon Stoddard, in the church at\nNorthampton. He marries the beautiful Sarah Pierrepont, whom he\ndescribes in his journal in a prose rhapsody which, like his\nmystical rhapsodies on religion in the same youthful period,\nglows with a clear unearthly beauty unmatched in any English\nprose of that century. For twenty-three years he serves the\nNorthampton church, and his sermons win him the rank of the\nforemost preacher in New England. John Wesley reads at Oxford his\naccount of the great revival of 1735. Whitefield comes to visit\nhim at Northampton. Then, in 1750, the ascetic preacher alienates\nhis church over issues pertaining to discipline and to the\nadministration of the sacrament. He is dismissed. He preaches his\n“farewell sermon,” like Wesley, like Emerson, like Newman, and\nmany another still unborn. He removes to Stockbridge, then a\nhamlet in the wilderness, preaches to the Indians, and writes\ntreatises on theology and metaphysics, among them the world\nfamous “Freedom of the Will.” In 1757, upon the death of his\nson-in-law, President Aaron Burr of Princeton, Edwards is called\nto the vacant Presidency. He is reluctant to go, for though he is\nonly fifty-four, his health has never been robust, and he has his\ngreat book on the “History of Redemption” still to write. But he\naccepts, finds the smallpox raging in Princeton upon his arrival\nin January, 1758, is inoculated, and dies of the disease in\nMarch–his dreams unfulfilled, his life-work once more thwarted.\nClose by the tomb of this saint is the tomb of his grandson,\nAaron Burr, who killed Hamilton.",
        "The literary reputation of Jonathan Edwards has turned, like the\nvicissitudes of his life, upon factors that could not be\nforeseen. His contemporary fame was chiefly as a preacher, and\nwas due to sermons like those upon “God Glorified in Man’s\nDependence” and “The Reality of Spiritual Life,” rather than to\nsuch discourses as the Enfield sermon, “Sinners in the Hands of\nan Angry God,” which in our own day is the best known of his\ndeliverances. Legends have grown up around this terrific Enfield\nsermon. Its fearful power over its immediate hearers cannot be\ngainsaid, and it will long continue to be quoted as an example of\nthe length to which a Calvinistic logician of genius was\ncompelled by his own scheme to go. We still see the tall,\nsweet-faced man, worn by his daily twelve hours of intense mental\ntoil, leaning on one elbow in the pulpit and reading from\nmanuscript, without even raising his gentle voice, those words\nwhich smote his congregation into spasms of terror and which seem\nto us sheer blasphemy.",
        "Yet the “Farewell Sermon of 1750” gives a more characteristic\nview of Edwards’s mind and heart, and conveys an ineffaceable\nimpression of his nobility of soul. His diction, like\nWordsworth’s, is usually plain almost to bareness; the formal\nframework of his discourses is obtruded; and he hunts objections\nto their last hiding place with wearisome pertinacity. Yet his\nlogic is incandescent. Steel sometimes burns to the touch like\nthis, in the bitter winters of New England, and one wonders\nwhether Edwards’s brain was not of ice, so pitiless does it seem.\nHis treatise denying the freedom of the will has given him a\nEuropean reputation comparable with that enjoyed by Franklin in\nscience and Jefferson in political propaganda. It was really a\npolemic demonstrating the sovereignty of God, rather than pure\ntheology or metaphysics. Edwards goes beyond Augustine and Calvin\nin asserting the arbitrary will of the Most High and in “denying\nto the human will any self-determining power.” He has been\nrefuted by events and tendencies, such as the growth of\nhistorical criticism and the widespread acceptance of the\ndoctrine of evolution, rather than by the might of any single\nantagonist. So, too, the Dred Scott decision of Chief Justice\nTaney, holding that the slave was not a citizen, was not so much\nanswered by opponents as it was superseded by the arbitrament of\nwar. But the idealism of this lonely thinker has entered deeply\nand permanently into the spiritual life of his countrymen, and he\nwill continue to be read by a few of those who still read Plato\nand Dante.",
        "“My mother grieves,” wrote Benjamin Franklin to his father in\n1738, “that one of her sons is an Arian, another an Arminian.\nWhat an Arminian or an Arian is, I cannot say that I very well\nknow. The truth is I make such distinctions very little my\nstudy.” To understand Franklin’s indifference to such\ndistinctions, we must realize how completely he represents the\nsecularizing tendencies of his age. What a drama of worldly\nadventure it all was, this roving life of the tallow-chandler’s\nson, who runs away from home, walks the streets of Philadelphia\nwith the famous loaves of bread under his arm, is diligent in\nbusiness, slips over to London, where he gives lessons in\nswimming and in total abstinence, slips back to Philadelphia and\nbecomes its leading citizen, fights the long battle of the\nAmerican colonies in London, sits in the Continental Congress,\nsails to Europe to arrange that French Alliance which brought our\nRevolution to a successful issue, and comes home at last, full of\nyears and honors, to a bland and philosophical exit from the\nstage!",
        "He broke with every Puritan tradition. The Franklins were\nrelatively late comers to New England. They sprang from a long\nline of blacksmiths at Ecton in Northamptonshire. The seat of the\nWashingtons was not far away, and Franklin’s latest biographer\npoints out that the pink-coated huntsmen of the Washington gentry\nmay often have stopped at Ecton to have their horses shod at the\nFranklin smithy. Benjamin’s father came out in 1685, more than\nfifty years after the most notable Puritan emigration. Young\nBenjamin, born in 1706, was as untouched by the ardors of that\nelder generation as he would have been by the visions of\nDante–an author, by the way, whom he never mentions, even as he\nnever mentions Shakespeare. He had no reverence for Puritan New\nEngland. To its moral beauty, its fine severity, he was wholly\nblind. As a boy he thriftily sold his Pilgrim’s “Progress.” He\nbecame, in the new fashion of that day, a Deist. Like a true\nchild of the eighteenth century, his attitude toward the\nseventeenth was that of amused or contemptuous superiority.\nThackeray has somewhere a charming phrase about his own love for\nthe back seat of the stage-coach, the seat which, in the old\ncoaching days, gave one a view of the receding landscape.\nThackeray, like Burke before him, loved historical associations,\nhistorical sentiment, the backward look over the long road which\nhumanity has traveled. But Franklin faced the other way. He would\nhave endorsed his friend Jefferson’s scornful sentence, “The dead\nhave no rights.” He joined himself wholly to that eighteenth\ncentury in which his own lot was cast, and, alike in his\nqualities and in his defects, he became one of its most perfect\nrepresentatives.",
        "To catch the full spirit of that age, turn for an instant to the\nLondon of 1724–the year of Franklin’s arrival. Thirty-six years\nhave elapsed since the glorious Revolution of 1688; the Whig\nprinciples, then triumphant, have been tacitly accepted by both\npolitical parties; the Jacobite revolt of 1715 has proved a\nfiasco; the country has accepted the House of Hanover and a\ngovernment by party leadership of the House of Commons, and it\ndoes not care whether Sir Robert Walpole buys a few rotten\nboroughs, so long as he maintains peace with Europe and\nprosperity at home. England is weary of seventeenth century\n“enthusiasm,” weary of conflict, sick of idealism. She has found\nin the accepted Whig principles a satisfactory compromise, a\nworking theory of society, a modus vivendi which nobody supposes\nis perfect but which will answer the prayer appointed to be read\nin all the churches, “Grant us peace in our time, O Lord.” The\ntheories to which men gave their lives in the seventeenth century\nseem ghostly in their unreality; but the prize turnips on Sir\nRobert’s Norfolk farm, and the wines in his cellar, and the\noffices at his disposal–these are very real indeed. London\nmerchants are making money; the squire and the parson are\ntranquilly ruling the country parishes; the philosophy of John\nLocke is everywhere triumphant. Mr. Pope is the poet of the hour,\nand his “Essay on Man,” counseling acceptance of our mortal\nsituation, is considered to be the last word of human wisdom and\nof poetical elegance. In prose, the style of the “Spectator\"\nrules–an admirable style, Franklin thought, and he imitated it\npatiently until its ease and urbanity had become his own. And\nindeed, how much of that London of the third decade of the\ncentury passed into the mind of the inquisitive, roving,\nloose-living printer’s apprentice from Philadelphia! It taught\nhim that the tangible world is the real world, and that nothing\nsucceeds like success; but it never even whispered to him that\nsometimes nothing damns like success.",
        "In his limitations, no less than in his power of assimilation,\nFranklin was the representative man of his era. He had no\nartistic interests, no liking for metaphysics after his brief\ndevotion, in early manhood, to the dialogues of Plato. He taught\nhimself some Latin, but he came to believe that the classics had\nlittle significance and that they should be superseded by the\nmodern languages. For the mediaeval world he had no patience or\nunderstanding. To these defects of his century we must add some\nfailings of his own. He was not always truthful. He had an\nindelible streak of coarseness. His conception of the “art of\nvirtue” was mechanical. When Carlyle called Franklin the “father\nof all the Yankees,” we must remember that the Scotch prophet\nhated Yankees and believed that Franklin’s smooth, plausible,\ntrader type of morality was only a broad way to the everlasting\nbonfire.",
        "But it is folly to linger over the limitations of the tallow-\nchandler’s son. The catalogue of his beneficent activity is a\nvast one. Balzac once characterized him as the man who invented\nthe lightning-rod, the hoax, and the republic. His contributions\nto science have to do with electricity, earthquakes, geology,\nmeteorology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics,\nnavigation of air and water, agriculture, medicine, and hygiene.\nIn some of these fields he did pioneer work of lasting\nsignificance. His teachings of thrift and prudence, as formulated\nin the maxims of Poor Richard, gave him a world-wide reputation.\nHe attacked war, like Voltaire, not so much for its wickedness as\nfor its folly, and cheerfully gave up many years of a long life\nto the effort to promote a better understanding among the nations\nof the world.",
        "It is perhaps needless to add what all persons who love good\nwriting know, that Benjamin Franklin was a most delightful\nwriter. His letters cover an amusing and extraordinary variety of\ntopics. He ranges from balloons to summer hats, and from the\nadvantages of deep ploughing to bifocal glasses, which, by the\nway, he invented. He argues for sharp razors and cold baths, and\nfor fresh air in the sleeping-room. He discusses the morals of\nthe game of chess, the art of swimming, the evils of smoky\nchimneys, the need of reformed spelling. Indeed, his passion for\nimprovement led him not only to try his hand upon an abridgment\nof the Book of Common Prayer, but to go even so far as to propose\nseriously a new rendering of the Lord’s Prayer. His famous\nproposal for a new version of the Bible, however, which Matthew\nArnold solemnly held up to reprobation, was only a joke which\nMatthew Arnold did not see-the new version of Job being, in fact,\na clever bit of political satire against party leadership in\nEngland. Even more brilliant examples of his skill in political\nsatire are his imaginary “Edict of the King of Prussia against\nEngland,” and his famous “Rules for Reducing a Great Empire to a\nSmall One.\"But I must not try to call the roll of all the good\nthings in Franklin’s ten volumes. I will simply say that those\nwho know Franklin only in his “Autobiography,” charming as that\nclassic production is, have made but an imperfect acquaintance\nwith the range, the vitality, the vigor of this admirable\ncraftsman who chose a style “smooth, clear, and short,” and made\nit serve every purpose of his versatile and beneficent mind.",
        "When the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765 startled the American\ncolonies out of their provincial sense of security and made them\naware of their real attitude toward the mother country, Franklin\nwas in London. Eleven years earlier, in 1754, he had offered a\nplan for the “Union of the Colonies,” but this had not\ncontemplated separation from England. It was rather what we\nshould call a scheme for imperial federation under the British\nCrown. We may use his word union, however, in a different field\nfrom that of politics. How much union of sentiment, of mental and\nmoral life, of literary, educational, and scientific endeavor,\nwas there in the colonies when the hour of self-examination came?\nOnly the briefest summary may be attempted here. As to race,\nthese men of the third and fourth generation since the planting\nof the colonies were by no means so purely English as the first\nsettlers. The 1,600,000 colonists in 1760 were mingled of many\nstocks, the largest non-English elements being German and\nScotch-Irish–that is, Scotch who had settled for a while in\nUlster before emigrating to America. “About one-third of the\ncolonists in 1760,” says Professor Channing, “were born outside\nof America.” Crevecoeur’s “Letters from an American Farmer” thus\ndefined the Americans: “They are a mixture of English, Scotch,\nIrish, French, Dutch, Germans, and Swedes. From this promiscuous\nbreed that race now called Americans has arisen.” The Atlantic\nseaboard, with a narrow strip inland, was fairly well covered by\nlocal communities, differing in blood, in religion, in political\norganization–a congeries of separate experiments or young\nutopias, waiting for that most utopian experiment of all, a\nfederal union. But the dominant language of the “promiscuous\nbreed” was English, and in the few real centers of intellectual\nlife the English tradition was almost absolute.",
        "The merest glance at colonial journalism will confirm this\nestimate. The “Boston News-Letter,” begun in 1704, was the first\nof the journals, if we omit the single issue of “Publick\nOccurrences” in the same town in 1690. By 1765 there were nearly\nfifty colonial newspapers and several magazines. Their influence\nmade for union, in Franklin’s sense of that word, and their\nliterary models, like their paper, type, and even ink, were found\nin London. The “New England Courant,” established in Boston in\n1721 by James Franklin, is full of imitations of the “Tatler,\"\n“Spectator,” and “Guardian.” What is more, the “Courant” boasted\nof its office collection of books, including Shakespeare, Milton,\nthe “Spectator,” and Swift’s “Tale of a Tub.\"* This was in 1722.\nIf we remember that no allusion to Shakespeare has been\ndiscovered in the colonial literature of the seventeenth century,\nand scarcely an allusion to the Puritan poet Milton, and that the\nHarvard College Library in 1723 had nothing of Addison, Steele,\nBolingbroke, Dryden, Pope, and Swift, and had only recently\nobtained copies of Milton and Shakespeare, we can appreciate the\nvalue of James Franklin’s apprenticeship in London. Perhaps we\ncan even forgive him for that attack upon the Mathers which threw\nthe conduct of the “Courant,” for a brief period, into the hands\nof his brother Benjamin, whose turn at a London apprenticeship\nwas soon to come.",
        "* Cook, E. C. “Literary Influences in Colonial Newspapers,\n1704-1750.” N. Y., 1912.",
        "If we follow this younger brother to Philadelphia and to\nBradford’s “American Mercury” or to Franklin’s own “Pennsylvania\nGazette,” or if we study the “Gazettes” of Maryland, Virginia,\nand South Carolina, the impression is still the same. The\nliterary news is still chiefly from London, from two months to a\nyear late. London books are imported and reprinted. Franklin\nreprints Pamela, and his Library Company of Philadelphia has two\ncopies of “Paradise Lost “for circulation in 1741, whereas there\nhad been no copy of that work in the great library of Cotton\nMather. American journalism then, as now, owed its vitality to a\nsecular spirit of curiosity about the actual world. It followed\nEngland as its model, but it was beginning to develop a temper of\nits own.",
        "Colonial education and colonial science were likewise chiefly\nindebted to London, but by 1751 Franklin’s papers on electricity\nbegan to repay the loan. A university club in New York in 1745\ncould have had but fifteen members at most, for these were all\nthe “academics” in town. Yet Harvard had then been sending forth\nher graduates for more than a century. William and Mary was\nfounded in 1693, Yale in 1701, Princeton in 1746, King’s (now\nColumbia) in 1754, the University of Pennsylvania in 1755, and\nBrown in 1764. These colonial colleges were mainly in the hands\nof clergymen. They tended to reproduce a type of scholarship\nbased upon the ancient languages. The curriculum varied but\nlittle in the different colonies, and this fact helped to produce\na feeling of fellowship among all members of the republic of\nletters. The men who debated the Stamp Act were, with a few\nstriking exceptions, men trained in Latin and Greek, familiar\nwith the great outlines of human history, accustomed to the\ndiscipline of academic disputation. They knew the ideas and the\nvocabulary of cultivated Europe and were conscious of no\nprovincial inferiority. In the study of the physical sciences,\nlikewise, the colonials were but little behind the mother\ncountry. The Royal Society had its distinguished members here.\nThe Mathers, the Dudleys, John Winthrop of Connecticut, John\nBartram, James Logan, James Godfrey, Cadwallader Colden, and\nabove all, Franklin himself, were winning the respect of European\nstudents, and were teaching Americans to use their eyes and their\nminds not merely upon the records of the past but in searching\nout the inexhaustible meanings of the present. There is no more\nfascinating story than that of the beginnings of American science\nin and outside of the colleges, and this movement, like the\ninfluence of journalism and of the higher education, counted for\ncolonial union.",
        "Professor Tyler, our foremost literary student of the period,\nsummarizes the characteristics of colonial literature in these\nwords: “Before the year 1765, we find in this country, not one\nAmerican people, but many American peoples . . . . No cohesive\nprinciple prevailed, no centralizing life; each little nation was\nworking out its own destiny in its own fashion.” But he adds that\nwith that year the colonial isolation came to an end, and that\nthe student must thereafter “deal with the literature of one\nmultitudinous people, variegated, indeed, in personal traits, but\nsingle in its commanding ideas and in its national destinies.” It\nis easy to be wise after the event. Yet there was living in\nLondon in 1765, as the agent for Pennsylvania, a shrewd and bland\nColonial–an honorary M. A. from both Harvard and Yale, a D.C.L.\nof Oxford and an LL.D. of St. Andrews who was by no means sure\nthat the Stamp Act meant the end of Colonialism. And Franklin’s\nuncertainty was shared by Washington. When the tall Virginian\ntook command of the Continental Army as late as 1775, he\n“abhorred the idea of independence.” Nevertheless John Jay,\nwriting the second number of the “Federalist” in 1787, only\ntwelve years later, could say: “Providence has been pleased to\ngive this one connected country to one united people; a people\ndescended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language,\nprofessing the same religion, attached to the same principles of\ngovernment.”",
