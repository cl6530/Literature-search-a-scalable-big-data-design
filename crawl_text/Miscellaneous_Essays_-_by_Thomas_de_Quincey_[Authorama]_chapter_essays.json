        "IN MACBETH.",
        "From my boyish days I had always felt a great perplexity on one point in\nMacbeth. It was this: the knocking at the gate, which succeeds to the\nmurder of Duncan, produced to my feelings an effect for which I never could\naccount. The effect was, that it reflected back upon the murder a peculiar\nawfulness and a depth of solemnity; yet, however obstinately I endeavored\nwith my understanding to comprehend this, for many years I never could see\nwhy it should produce such an effect.",
        "Here I pause for one moment, to exhort the reader never to pay any\nattention to his understanding when it stands in opposition to any\nother faculty of his mind. The mere understanding, however useful and\nindispensable, is the meanest faculty in the human mind, and the most to\nbe distrusted; and yet the great majority of people trust to nothing else;\nwhich may do for ordinary life, but not for philosophical purposes. Of this\nout of ten thousand instances that I might produce, I will cite one. Ask of\nany person whatsoever, who is not previously prepared for the demand by\na knowledge of perspective, to draw in the rudest way the commonest\nappearance which depends upon the laws of that science; as for instance, to\nrepresent the effect of two walls standing at right angles to each other,\nor the appearance of the houses on each side of a street, as seen by a\nperson looking down the street from one extremity. Now in all cases, unless\nthe person has happened to observe in pictures how it is that artists\nproduce these effects, he will be utterly unable to make the smallest\napproximation to it. Yet why? For he has actually seen the effect every day\nof his life. The reason is–that he allows his understanding to overrule\nhis eyes. His understanding, which includes no intuitive knowledge of the\nlaws of vision, can furnish him with no reason why a line which is known\nand can be proved to be a horizontal line, should not appear a horizontal\nline; a line that made any angle with the perpendicular less than a right\nangle, would seem to him to indicate that his houses were all tumbling down\ntogether. Accordingly he makes the line of his houses a horizontal line,\nand fails of course to produce the effect demanded. Here then is one\ninstance out of many, in which not only the understanding is allowed to\noverrule the eyes, but where the understanding is positively allowed to\nobliterate the eyes as it were, for not only does the man believe the\nevidence of his understanding in opposition to that of his eyes, but,\n(what is monstrous!) the idiot is not aware that his eyes ever gave such\nevidence. He does not know that he has seen (and therefore quoad his\nconsciousness has not seen) that which he has seen every day of his\nlife. But to return from this digression, my understanding could furnish no\nreason why the knocking at the gate in Macbeth should produce any effect,\ndirect or reflected. In fact, my understanding said positively that it\ncould not produce any effect. But I knew better; I felt that it did; and\nI waited and clung to the problem until further knowledge should enable me\nto solve it. At length, in 1812, Mr. Williams made his début on the stage\nof Ratcliffe Highway, and executed those unparalleled murders which have\nprocured for him such a brilliant and undying reputation. On which murders,\nby the way, I must observe, that in one respect they have had an ill\neffect, by making the connoisseur in murder very fastidious in his taste,\nand dissatisfied by anything that has been since done in that line. All\nother murders look pale by the deep crimson of his; and, as an amateur once\nsaid to me in a querulous tone, “There has been absolutely nothing doingsince his time, or nothing that’s worth speaking of.” But this is wrong;\nfor it is unreasonable to expect all men to be great artists, and born with\nthe genius of Mr. Williams. Now it will be remembered that in the first of\nthese murders, (that of the Marrs,) the same incident (of a knocking at the\ndoor soon after the work of extermination was complete) did actually occur,\nwhich the genius of Shakspeare has invented; and all good judges, and\nthe most eminent dilettanti, acknowledged the felicity of Shakspeare’s\nsuggestion as soon as it was actually realized. Here, then, was a fresh\nproof that I was right in relying on my own feeling in opposition to my\nunderstanding; and I again set myself to study the problem; at length\nI solved it to my own satisfaction; and my solution is this. Murder in\nordinary cases, where the sympathy is wholly directed to the case of the\nmurdered person, is an incident of coarse and vulgar horror; and for this\nreason, that it flings the interest exclusively upon the natural but\nignoble instinct by which we cleave to life; an instinct, which, as being\nindispensable to the primal law of self-preservation, is the same in kind,\n(though different in degree,) amongst all living creatures; this instinct\ntherefore, because it annihilates all distinctions, and degrades the\ngreatest of men to the level of “the poor beetle that we tread on,\"\nexhibits human nature in its most abject and humiliating attitude. Such an\nattitude would little suit the purposes of the poet. What then must he\ndo? He must throw the interest on the murderer. Our sympathy must be with\nhim; (of course I mean a sympathy of comprehension, a sympathy by which\nwe enter into his feelings, and are made to understand them,–not a\nsympathy[1] of pity or approbation.) In the murdered person all strife of\nthought, all flux and reflux of passion and of purpose, are crushed by one\noverwhelming panic; the fear of instant death smites him “with its petrific\nmace.” But in the murderer, such a murderer as a poet will condescend to,\nthere must be raging some great storm of passion,–jealousy, ambition,\nvengeance, hatred,–which will create a hell within him; and into this hell\nwe are to look.",
        "[Footnote 1: It seems almost ludicrous to guard and explain my use of a\nword in a situation where it would naturally explain itself. But it has\nbecome necessary to do so, in consequence of the unscholarlike use of the\nword sympathy, at present so general, by which, instead of taking it in\nits proper sense, as the act of reproducing in our minds the feelings of\nanother, whether for hatred, indignation, love, pity, or approbation, it\nis made a mere synonyme of the word pity; and hence, instead of saying\n\"sympathy with another,” many writers adopt the monstrous barbarism of\n\"sympathy for another.\"]",
        "In Macbeth, for the sake of gratifying his own enormous and teeming faculty\nof creation, Shakspeare has introduced two murderers: and, as usual in his\nhands, they are remarkably discriminated: but, though in Macbeth the strife\nof mind is greater than in his wife, the tiger spirit not so awake, and his\nfeelings caught chiefly by contagion from her,–yet, as both were finally\ninvolved in the guilt of murder, the murderous mind of necessity is finally\nto be presumed in both. This was to be expressed; and on its own account,\nas well as to make it a more proportionable antagonist to the unoffending\nnature of their victim, “the gracious Duncan,” and adequately to expound\n\"the deep damnation of his taking off,” this was to be expressed with\npeculiar energy. We were to be made to feel that the human nature, i.e.,\nthe divine nature of love and mercy, spread through the hearts of all\ncreatures, and seldom utterly withdrawn from man,–was gone, vanished,\nextinct; and that the fiendish nature had taken its place. And, as this\neffect is marvellously accomplished in the dialogues and soliloquiesthemselves, so it is finally consummated by the expedient under\nconsideration; and it is to this that I now solicit the reader’s attention.\nIf the reader has ever witnessed a wife, daughter, or sister, in a fainting\nfit, he may chance to have observed that the most affecting moment in\nsuch a spectacle, is that in which a sigh and a stirring announce the\nrecommencement of suspended life. Or, if the reader has ever been present\nin a vast metropolis, on the day when some great national idol was carried\nin funeral pomp to his grave, and chancing to walk near the course through\nwhich it passed, has felt powerfully, in the silence and desertion of the\nstreets and in the stagnation of ordinary business, the deep interest which\nat that moment was possessing the heart of man,–if all at once he should\nhear the death-like stillness broken up by the sound of wheels rattling\naway from the scene, and making known that the transitory vision was\ndissolved, he will be aware that at no moment was his sense of the complete\nsuspension and pause in ordinary human concerns so full and affecting, as\nat that moment when the suspension ceases, and the goings-on of human\nlife are suddenly resumed. All action in any direction is best expounded,\nmeasured, and made apprehensible, by reaction. Now apply this to the case\nin Macbeth. Here, as I have said, the retiring of the human heart and the\nentrance of the fiendish heart was to be expressed and made sensible.\nAnother world has stepped in; and the murderers are taken out of the region\nof human things, human purposes, human desires. They are transfigured: Lady\nMacbeth is “unsexed;” Macbeth has forgot that he was born of woman; both\nare conformed to the image of devils; and the world of devils is suddenly\nrevealed. But how shall this be conveyed and made palpable? In order that a\nnew world may step in, this world must for a time disappear. The murderers,\nand the murder, must be insulated–cut off by an immeasurable gulph\nfrom the ordinary tide and succession of human affairs–locked up and\nsequestered in some deep recess; we must be made sensible that the world\nof ordinary life is suddenly arrested–laid asleep–tranced–racked into\na dread armistice: time must be annihilated; relation to things without\nabolished; and all must pass self-withdrawn into a deep syncope and\nsuspension of earthly passion. Hence it is, that when the deed is done,\nwhen the work of darkness is perfect, then the world of darkness passes\naway like a pageantry in the clouds: the knocking at the gate is heard; and\nit makes known audibly that the reaction has commenced: the human has made\nits reflux upon the fiendish; the pulses of life are beginning to beat\nagain; and the re-establishment of the goings-on of the world in which we\nlive, first makes us profoundly sensible of the awful parenthesis that had\nsuspended them.",
        "O, mighty poet! Thy works are not as those of other men, simply and merely\ngreat works of art; but are also like the phenomena of nature, like the sun\nand the sea, the stars and the flowers,–like frost and snow, rain and dew,\nhail-storm and thunder, which are to be studied with entire submission of\nour own faculties, and in the perfect faith that in them there can be no\ntoo much or too little, nothing useless or inert–but that, the further\nwe press in our discoveries, the more we shall see proofs of design and\nself-supporting arrangement where the careless eye had seen nothing but\naccident!",
        "On Murder,",
        "CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE FINE ARTS.",
        "TO THE EDITOR OF BLACKWOOD’S MAGAZINE.",
        "SIR,–We have all heard of a Society for the Promotion of Vice, of the\nHell-Fire Club, &c. At Brighton, I think it was, that a Society was formed\nfor the Suppression of Virtue. That society was itself suppressed–but I\nam sorry to say that another exists in London, of a character still\nmore atrocious. In tendency, it may be denominated a Society for the\nEncouragement of Murder; but, according to their own delicate [Greek:\neuphaemismos], it is styled–The Society of Connoisseurs in Murder. They\nprofess to be curious in homicide; amateurs and dilettanti in the various\nmodes of bloodshed; and, in short, Murder-Fanciers. Every fresh atrocity\nof that class, which the police annals of Europe bring up, they meet and\ncriticise as they would a picture, statue, or other work of art. But I\nneed not trouble myself with any attempt to describe the spirit of their\nproceedings, as you will collect that much better from one of the Monthly\nLectures read before the society last year. This has fallen into my hands\naccidentally, in spite of all the vigilance exercised to keep their\ntransactions from the public eye. The publication of it will alarm them;\nand my purpose is that it should. For I would much rather put them down\nquietly, by an appeal to public opinion through you, than by such an\nexposure of names as would follow an appeal to Bow Street; which last\nappeal, however, if this should fail, I must positively resort to. For it\nis scandalous that such things should go on in a Christian land. Even in a\nheathen land, the toleration of murder was felt by a Christian writer to be\nthe most crying reproach of the public morals. This writer was Lactantius;\nand with his words, as singularly applicable to the present occasion, I\nshall conclude: “Quid tam horribile,” says he, “tam tetrum, quam hominis\ntrucidatio? Ideo severissimis legibus vita nostra munitur; ideo bella\nexecrabilia sunt. Invenit tamen consuetudo quatenus homicidium sine bello\nac sine legibus faciat: et hoc sibi voluptas quod scelus vindicavit.\nQuod si interesse homicidio sceleris conscientia est,–et eidem facinori\nspectator obstrictus est cui et admissor; ergo et in his gladiatorum\ncædibus non minus cruore profunditur qui spectat, quam ille qui facit:\nnec potest esse immunis à sanguine qui voluit effundi; aut videri non\ninterfecisse, qui interfectori et favit et proemium postulavit.” “Human\nlife,” says he, “is guarded by laws of the uttermost rigor, yet custom has\ndevised a mode of evading them in behalf of murder; and the demands of\ntaste (voluptas) are now become the same as those of abandoned guilt.” Let\nthe Society of Gentlemen Amateurs consider this; and let me call their\nespecial attention to the last sentence, which is so weighty, that I shall\nattempt to convey it in English: “Now, if merely to be present at a\nmurder fastens on a man the character of an accomplice; if barely to be a\nspectator involves us in one common guilt with the perpetrator; it follows\nof necessity, that, in these murders of the amphitheatre, the hand which\ninflicts the fatal blow is not more deeply imbrued in blood that his who\nsits and looks on: neither can he be clear of blood who has countenanced\nits shedding; nor that man seem other than a participator in murder who\ngives his applause to the murderer, and calls for prizes in his behalf.\"\nThe ’præmia postulavit” I have not yet heard charged upon the Gentlemen\nAmateurs of London, though undoubtedly their proceedings tend to that;\nbut the ’interfectori favil” is implied in the very title of this\nassociation, and expressed in every line of the lecture which I send you.",

        "LECTURE.",
        "GENTLEMEN,–I have had the honor to be appointed by your committee to the\ntrying task of reading the Williams’ Lecture on Murder, considered as one\nof the Fine Arts; a task which might be easy enough three or four centuries\nago, when the art was little understood, and few great models had been\nexhibited; but in this age, when masterpieces of excellence have been\nexecuted by professional men, it must be evident, that in the style\nof criticism applied to them, the public will look for something of a\ncorresponding improvement. Practice and theory must advance pari passu.\nPeople begin to see that something more goes to the composition of a fine\nmurder than two blockheads to kill and be killed–a knife–a purse–and a\ndark lane. Design, gentlemen, grouping, light and shade, poetry, sentiment,\nare now deemed indispensable to attempts of this nature. Mr. Williams\nhas exalted the ideal of murder to all of us; and to me, therefore, in\nparticular, has deepened the arduousness of my task. Like Æschylus or\nMilton in poetry, like Michael Angelo in painting, he has carried his art\nto a point of colossal sublimity; and, as Mr. Wordsworth observes, has in\na manner “created the taste by which he is to be enjoyed.” To sketch the\nhistory of the art, and to examine its principles critically, now remains\nas a duty for the connoisseur, and for judges of quite another stamp from\nhis Majesty’s Judges of Assize.",
        "Before I begin, let me say a word or two to certain prigs, who affect to\nspeak of our society as if it were in some degree immoral in its tendency.\nImmoral! God bless my soul, gentlemen, what is it that people mean? I am\nfor morality, and always shall be, and for virtue and all that; and I do\naffirm, and always shall, (let what will come of it,) that murder is an\nimproper line of conduct, highly improper; and I do not stick to assert,\nthat any man who deals in murder, must have very incorrect ways of\nthinking, and truly inaccurate principles; and so far from aiding and\nabetting him by pointing out his victim’s hiding-place, as a great\nmoralist[1] of Germany declared it to be every good man’s duty to do, I\nwould subscribe one shilling and sixpense to have him apprehended, which is\nmore by eighteen-pence than the most eminent moralists have subscribed for\nthat purpose. But what then? Everything in this world has two handles.\nMurder, for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle, (as it\ngenerally is in the pulpit, and at the Old Bailey;) and that, I confess,\nis its weak side; or it may also be treated æsthetically, as the Germans\ncall it, that is, in relation to good taste.",
        "[Footnote 1: Kant–who carried his demands of unconditional veracity to so\nextravagant a length as to affirm, that, if a man were to see an innocent\nperson escape from a murderer, it would be his duty, on being questioned\nby the murderer, to tell the truth, and to point out the retreat of the\ninnocent person, under any certainty of causing murder. Lest this doctrine\nshould be supposed to have escaped him in any heat of dispute, on being\ntaxed with it by a celebrated French writer, he solemnly reaffirmed it,\nwith his reasons.]",
        "To illustrate this, I will urge the authority of three eminent persons,\nviz., S.T. Coleridge, Aristotle, and Mr. Howship the surgeon. To begin with\nS.T.C. One night, many years ago, I was drinking tea with him in Berners’\nStreet, (which, by the way, for a short street, has been uncommonly\nfruitful in men of genius.) Others were there besides myself; and amidst\nsome carnal considerations of tea and toast, we were all imbibing a\ndissertation on Plotinus from the attic lips of S.T.C. Suddenly a cry arose\nof ’Fire–fire!” upon which all of us, master and disciples, Plato and\n[Greek: hoi peri ton Platona], rushed out, eager for the spectacle. The\nfire was in Oxford Street, at a piano-forte maker’s; and, as it promised to\nbe a conflagration of merit, I was sorry that my engagements forced me away\nfrom Mr. Coleridge’s party before matters were come to a crisis. Some days\nafter, meeting with my Platonic host, I reminded him of the case, and\nbegged to know how that very promising exhibition had terminated. “Oh,\nsir,” said he, “it turned out so ill, that we damned it unanimously.” Now,\ndoes any man suppose that Mr. Coleridge,–who, for all he is too fat to be\na person of active virtue, is undoubtedly a worthy Christian,–that this\ngood S. T. C., I say, was an incendiary, or capable of wishing any ill\nto the poor man and his piano-fortes (many of them, doubtless, with the\nadditional keys)? On the contrary, I know him to be that sort of man, that\nI durst stake my life upon it he would have worked an engine in a case of\nnecessity, although rather of the fattest for such fiery trials of his\nvirtue. But how stood the case? Virtue was in no request. On the arrival\nof the fire-engines, morality had devolved wholly on the insurance office.\nThis being the case, he had a right to gratify his taste. He had left his\ntea. Was he to have nothing in return?",
        "I contend that the most virtuous man, under the premises stated, was\nentitled to make a luxury of the fire, and to hiss it, as he would any\nother performance that raised expectations in the public mind, which\nafterwards it disappointed. Again, to cite another great authority,\nwhat says the Stagyrite? He (in the Fifth Book, I think it is, of his\nMetaphysics) describes what he calls [Greek: kleptaen teleion], i.e., a\nperfect thief; and, as to Mr. Howship, in a work of his on Indigestion, he\nmakes no scruple to talk with admiration of a certain ulcer which he had\nseen, and which he styles “a beautiful ulcer.” Now will any man pretend,\nthat, abstractedly considered, a thief could appear to Aristotle a perfect\ncharacter, or that Mr. Howship could be enamored of an ulcer? Aristotle,\nit is well known, was himself so very moral a character, that, not content\nwith writing his Nichomachean Ethics, in one volume octavo, he also\nwrote another system, called Magna Moralia, or Big Ethics. Now, it is\nimpossible that a man who composes any ethics at all, big or little, should\nadmire a thief per se, and, as to Mr. Howship, it is well known that he\nmakes war upon all ulcers; and, without suffering himself to be seduced by\ntheir charms, endeavors to banish them from the county of Middlesex. But\nthe truth is, that, however objectionable per se, yet, relatively to\nothers of their class, both a thief and an ulcer may have infinite degrees\nof merit. They are both imperfections, it is true; but to be imperfect\nbeing their essence, the very greatness of their imperfection becomes their\nperfection. Spartam nactus es, hunc exorna. A thief like Autolycus or\nMr. Barrington, and a grim phagedænic ulcer, superbly defined, and running\nregularly through all its natural stages, may no less justly be regarded\nas ideals after their kind, than the most faultless moss-rose amongst\nflowers, in its progress from bud to “bright consummate flower;” or,\namongst human flowers, the most magnificent young female, apparelled in\nthe pomp of womanhood. And thus not only the ideal of an inkstand may be\nimagined, (as Mr. Coleridge demonstrated in his celebrated correspondence\nwith Mr. Blackwood,) in which, by the way, there is not so much, because an\ninkstand is a laudable sort of thing, and a valuable member of society; but\neven imperfection itself may have its ideal or perfect state.",
        "Really, gentlemen, I beg pardon for so much philosophy at one time, and now\nlet me apply it. When a murder is in the paulo-post-futurum tense, and a\nrumor of it comes to our ears, by all means let us treat it morally. But\nsuppose it over and done, and that you can say of it,[Greek: Tetelesai],\nor (in that adamantine molossus of Medea) [Greek: eirzasai]; suppose the\npoor murdered man to be out of his pain, and the rascal that did it off\nlike a shot, nobody knows whither; suppose, lastly, that we have done our\nbest, by putting out our legs to trip up the fellow in his flight, but all\nto no purpose–\"abiit, evasit,” &c.–why, then, I say, what’s the use of\nany more virtue? Enough has been given to morality; now comes the turn of\nTaste and the Fine Arts. A sad thing it was, no doubt, very sad; but wecan’t mend it. Therefore let us make the best of a bad matter; and, as it\nis impossible to hammer anything out of it for moral purposes, let us treat\nit æsthetically, and see if it will turn to account in that way. Such is\nthe logic of a sensible man, and what follows? We dry up our tears, and\nhave the satisfaction, perhaps, to discover that a transaction, which,\nmorally considered, was shocking, and without a leg to stand upon,\nwhen tried by principles of Taste, turns out to be a very meritorious\nperformance. Thus all the world is pleased; the old proverb is justified,\nthat it is an ill wind which blows nobody good; the amateur, from looking\nbilious and sulky, by too close an attention to virtue, begins to pick up\nhis crumbs, and general hilarity prevails. Virtue has had her day; and\nhenceforward, Vertu and Connoisseurship have leave to provide for\nthemselves. Upon this principle, gentlemen, I propose to guide your\nstudies, from Cain to Mr. Thurtell. Through this great gallery of murder,\ntherefore, together let us wander hand in hand, in delighted admiration,\nwhile I endeavor to point your attention to the objects of profitable\ncriticism.",
        "The first murder is familiar to you all. As the inventor of murder, and the\nfather of the art, Cain must have been a man of first-rate genius. All the\nCains were men of genius. Tubal Cain invented tubes, I think, or some such\nthing. But, whatever were the originality and genius of the artist, every\nart was then in its infancy, and the works must be criticised with a\nrecollection of that fact. Even Tubal’s work would probably be little\napproved at this day in Sheffield; and therefore of Cain (Cain senior, I\nmean,) it is no disparagement to say, that his performance was but so so.\nMilton, however, is supposed to have thought differently. By his way of\nrelating the case, it should seem to have been rather a pet murder with\nhim, for he retouches it with an apparent anxiety for its picturesque\neffect:",
        "  Whereat he inly raged; and, as they talk’d,\n  Smote him into the midriff with a stone\n  That beat out life: he fell; and, deadly pale,\n  Groan’d out his soul with gushing blood effus’d.\n  Par. Lost, B. XI.",
        "Upon this, Richardson, the painter, who had an eye for effect, remarks as\nfollows, in his Notes on Paradise Lost, p. 497: “It has been thought,\"\nsays he, “that Cain beat (as the common saying is) the breath out of his\nbrother’s body with a great stone; Milton gives in to this, with the\naddition, however, of a large wound.” In this place it was a judicious\naddition; for the rudeness of the weapon, unless raised and enriched by\na warm, sanguinary coloring, has too much of the naked air of the savage\nschool; as if the deed were perpetrated by a Polypheme without science,\npremeditation, or anything but a mutton bone. However, I am chiefly pleased\nwith the improvement, as it implies that Milton was an amateur. As to\nShakspeare, there never was a better; as his description of the murdered\nDuke of Gloucester, in Henry VI., of Duncan’s, Banquo’s, &c., sufficiently\nproves.",
        "The foundation of the art having been once laid, it is pitiable to see how\nit slumbered without improvement for ages. In fact, I shall now be obliged\nto leap over all murders, sacred and profane, as utterly unworthy of\nnotice, until long after the Christian era. Greece, even in the age of\nPericles, produced no murder of the slightest merit; and Rome had too\nlittle originality of genius in any of the arts to succeed, where her\nmodel failed her. In fact, the Latin language sinks under the very idea of\nmurder. “The man was murdered;\"–how will this sound in Latin? Interfectus\nest, interemptus est–which simply expresses a homicide; and hence the\nChristian Latinity of the middle ages was obliged to introduce a new word,\nsuch as the feebleness of classic conceptions never ascended to. Murdratus\nest, says the sublimer dialect of Gothic ages. Meantime, the Jewish,\nschool of murder kept alive whatever was yet known in the art, and\ngradually transferred it to the Western World. Indeed the Jewish school was\nalways respectable, even in the dark ages, as the case of Hugh of Lincoln\nshows, which was honored with the approbation of Chaucer, on occasion of\nanother performance from the same school, which he puts into the mouth of\nthe Lady Abbess.",
        "Recurring, however, for one moment to classical antiquity, I cannot but\nthink that Catiline, Clodius, and some of that coterie, would have made\nfirst-rate artists; and it is on all accounts to be regretted, that the\npriggism of Cicero robbed his country of the only chance she had for\ndistinction in this line. As the subject of a murder, no person could\nhave answered better than himself. Lord! how he would have howled with\npanic, if he had heard Cethegus under his bed. It would have been truly\ndiverting to have listened to him; and satisfied I am, gentlemen, that he\nwould have preferred the utile of creeping into a closet, or even into a\ncloaca, to the honestum of facing the bold artist.",
        "To come now to the dark ages–(by which we, that speak with precision,\nmean, par excellence, the tenth century, and the times immediately before\nand after)–these ages ought naturally to be favorable to the art of\nmurder, as they were to church architecture, to stained glass, &c.; and,\naccordingly, about the latter end of this period, there arose a great\ncharacter in our art, I mean the Old Man of the Mountains. He was a shining\nlight, indeed, and I need not tell you, that the very word “assassin” is\ndeduced from him. So keen an amateur was he, that on one occasion, when his\nown life was attempted by a favorite assassin, he was so much pleased\nwith the talent shown, that notwithstanding the failure of the artist, he\ncreated him a duke upon the spot, with remainder to the female line, and\nsettled a pension on him for three lives. Assassination is a branch of the\nart which demands a separate notice; and I shall devote an entire lecture\nto it. Meantime, I shall only observe how odd it is, that this branch of\nthe art has flourished by fits. It never rains, but it pours. Our own age\ncan boast of some fine specimens; and, about two centuries ago, there was a\nmost brilliant constellation of murders in this class. I need hardly say,\nthat I allude especially to those five splendid works,–the assassinations\nof William I, of Orange, of Henry IV., of France, of the Duke of\nBuckingham, (which you will find excellently described in the letters\npublished by Mr. Ellis, of the British Museum,) of Gustavus Adolphus, and\nof Wallenstein. The King of Sweden’s assassination, by the by, is doubted\nby many writers, Harte amongst others; but they are wrong. He was murdered;\nand I consider his murder unique in its excellence; for he was murdered at\nnoon-day, and on the field of battle,–a feature of original conception,\nwhich occurs in no other work of art that I remember. Indeed, all of these\nassassinations may be studied with profit by the advanced connoisseur. They\nare all of them exemplaria, of which one may say,–",
        "  Nociurnâ versatâ manu, versate diurne;",
        "Especially nocturnâ.",
        "In these assassinations of princes and statesmen, there is nothing to\nexcite our wonder; important changes often depend on their deaths; and,\nfrom the eminence on which they stand, they are peculiarly exposed to the\naim of every artist who happens to be possessed by the craving for scenical\neffect. But there is another class of assassinations, which has prevailed\nfrom an early period of the seventeenth century, that really doessurprise me; I mean the assassination of philosophers. For, gentlemen, it\nis a fact, that every philosopher of eminence for the two last centuries\nhas either been murdered, or, at the least, been very near it; insomuch,\nthat if a man calls himself a philosopher, and never had his life\nattempted, rest assured there is nothing in him; and against Locke’s\nphilosophy in particular, I think it an unanswerable objection (if we\nneeded any), that, although he carried his throat about with him in this\nworld for seventy-two years, no man ever condescended to cut it. As these\ncases of philosophers are not much known, and are generally good and well\ncomposed in their circumstances, I shall here read an excursus on that\nsubject, chiefly by way of showing my own learning.",
        "The first great philosopher of the seventeenth century (if we except\nGalileo) was Des Cartes; and if ever one could say of a man that he was all\nbut murdered–murdered within an inch–one must say it of him. The case\nwas this, as reported by Baillet in his Vie De M. Des Cartes, tom. I. p.\n102-3. In the year 1621, when Des Cartes might be about twenty-six years\nold, he was touring about as usual, (for he was as restless as a hyæna,)\nand, coming to the Elbe, either at Gluckstadt or at Hamburgh, he took\nshipping for East Friezland: what he could want in East Friezland no man\nhas ever discovered; and perhaps he took this into consideration himself;\nfor, on reaching Embden, he resolved to sail instantly for WestFriezland; and being very impatient of delay, he hired a bark, with a few\nmariners to navigate it. No sooner had he got out to sea than he made a\npleasing discovery, viz. that he had shut himself up in a den of murderers.\nHis crew, says M. Baillet, he soon found out to be “des scélérats,\"–not\namateurs, gentlemen, as we are, but professional men–the height of\nwhose ambition at that moment was to cut his throat. But the story is too\npleasing to be abridged; I shall give it, therefore, accurately, from the\nFrench of his biographer: “M. Des Cartes had no company but that of his\nservant, with whom he was conversing in French. The sailors, who took him\nfor a foreign merchant, rather than a cavalier, concluded that he must\nhave money about him. Accordingly they came to a resolution by no means\nadvantageous to his purse. There is this difference, however, between\nsea-robbers and the robbers in forests, that the latter may, without\nhazard, spare the lives of their victims; whereas the other cannot put\na passenger on shore in such a case without running the risk of being\napprehended. The crew of M. Des Cartes arranged their measures with a view\nto evade any danger of that sort. They observed that he was a stranger from\na distance, without acquaintance in the country, and that nobody would take\nany trouble to inquire about him, in case he should never come to hand,\n(quand il viendroit à manquer.”) Think, gentlemen, of these Friezland\ndogs discussing a philosopher as if he were a puncheon of rum. “His temper,\nthey remarked, was very mild and patient; and, judging from the gentleness\nof his deportment, and the courtesy with which he treated themselves, that\nhe could be nothing more than some green young man, they concluded that\nthey should have all the easier task in disposing of his life. They made no\nscruple to discuss the whole matter in his presence, as not supposing that\nhe understood any other language than that in which he conversed with his\nservant; and the amount of their deliberation was–to murder him, then to\nthrow him into the sea, and to divide his spoils.”",
        "Excuse my laughing, gentlemen, but the fact is, I always do laugh when I\nthink of this case–two things about it seem so droll. One, is, the horrid\npanic or “funk,” (as the men of Eton call it,) in which Des Cartes must\nhave found himself upon hearing this regular drama sketched for his own\ndeath–funeral–succession and administration to his effects. But another\nthing, which seems to me still more funny about this affair is, that\nif these Friezland hounds had been “game,” we should have no Cartesian\nphilosophy; and how we could have done without that, considering the\nworlds of books it has produced, I leave to any respectable trunk-maker to\ndeclare.",
        "However, to go on; spite of his enormous funk, Des Cartes showed fight,\nand by that means awed these Anti-Cartesian rascals. “Finding,” says M.\nBaillet, “that the matter was no joke, M. Des Cartes leaped upon his feet\nin a trice, assumed a stern countenance that these cravens had never looked\nfor, and addressing them in their own language, threatened to run them\nthrough on the spot if they dared to offer him any insult.” Certainly,\ngentlemen, this would have been an honor far above the merits of such\ninconsiderable rascals–to be spitted like larks upon a Cartesian sword;\nand therefore I am glad M. Des Cartes did not rob the gallows by executing\nhis threat, especially as he could not possibly have brought his vessel to\nport, after he had murdered his crew; so that he must have continued to\ncruise for ever in the Zuyder Zee, and would probably have been mistaken by\nsailors for the Flying Dutchman, homeward bound. “The spirit which M. Des\nCartes manifested,” says his biographer, “had the effect of magic on these\nwretches. The suddenness of their consternation struck their minds with a\nconfusion which blinded them to their advantage, and they conveyed him to\nhis destination as peaceably as he could desire.”",
        "Possibly, gentlemen, you may fancy that, on the model of Cæsar’s address\nto his poor ferryman,–\"Cæsarem vehis et fortunas ejus\"–M. Des Cartes\nneeded only to have said,–\"Dogs, you cannot cut my throat, for you carry\nDes Cartes and his philosophy,” and might safely have defied them to do\ntheir worst. A German emperor had the same notion, when, being cautioned to\nkeep out of the way of a cannonading, he replied, “Tut! man. Did you ever\nhear of a cannon-ball that killed an emperor?” As to an emperor I cannot\nsay, but a less thing has sufficed to smash a philosoper; and the next\ngreat philosopher of Europe undoubtedly was murdered. This was Spinosa.",
        "I know very well the common opinion about him is, that he died in his bed.\nPerhaps he did, but he was murdered for all that; and this I shall prove\nby a book published at Brussels, in the year 1731, entitled, La Via de\nSpinosa; Par M. Jean Colerus, with many additions, from a MS. life, by one\nof his friends. Spinosa died on the 21st February, 1677, being then little\nmore than forty-four years old. This of itself looks suspicious; and M.\nJean admits, that a certain expression in the MS. life of him would warrant\nthe conclusion, “que sa mort n’a pas été tout-à-fait naturelle.” Living in\na damp country, and a sailor’s country, like Holland, he may be thought to\nhave indulged a good deal in grog, especially in punch,[1] which was then\nnewly discovered. Undoubtedly he might have done so; but the fact is that\nhe did not. M. Jean calls him “extrêmement sobre en son boire et en son\nmanger.” And though some wild stories were afloat about his using the juice\nof mandragora (p. 140,) and opium, (p. 144,) yet neither of these articles\nappeared in his druggist’s bill. Living, therefore, with such sobriety, how\nwas it possible that he should die a natural death at forty-four? Hear his\nbiographer’s account:–\"Sunday morning the 21st of February, before it was\nchurch time, Spinosa came down stairs and conversed with the master and\nmistress of the house.” At this time, therefore, perhaps ten o’clock on\nSunday morning, you see that Spinosa was alive, and pretty well. But it\nseems “he had summoned from Amsterdam a certain physician, whom,” says the\nbiographer, “I shall not otherwise point out to notice than by these two\nletters, L.M. This L.M. had directed the people of the house to purchase an\nancient cock, and to have him boiled forthwith, in order that Spinosa might\ntake some broth about noon, which in fact he did, and ate some of the old\ncock with a good appetite, after the landlord and his wife had returned\nfrom church.",
        "[Footnote 1: “June 1, 1675.–Drinke part of 3 boules of punch, (a liquor\nvery strainge to me,)” says the Rev. Mr. Henry Teonge, in his Diary lately\npublished. In a note on this passage, a reference is made to Fryer’s\nTravels to the East Indies, 1672, who speaks of “that enervating liquor\ncalled Paunch, (which is Indostan for five,) from five ingredients.\"\nMade thus, it seems the medical men called it Diapente; if with four only,\nDiatessaron. No doubt, it was its Evangelical name that recommended it to\nthe Rev. Mr. Teonge.]",
        "“In the afternoon, L.M. staid alone with Spinosa, the people of the house\nhaving returned to church; on coming out from which they learnt, with much\nsurprise, that Spinosa had died about three o’clock, in the presence\nof L.M., who took his departure for Amsterdam the same evening, by the\nnight-boat, without paying the least attention to the deceased. No doubt he\nwas the readier to dispense with these duties, as he had possessed himself\nof a ducatoon and a small quantity of silver, together with a silver-hafted\nknife, and had absconded with his pillage.” Here you see, gentlemen, the\nmurder is plain, and the manner of it. It was L.M. who murdered Spinosa\nfor his money. Poor S. was an invalid, meagre, and weak: as no blood\nwas observed, L.M., no doubt, threw him down and smothered him with\npillows,–the poor man being already half suffocated by his infernal\ndinner. But who was L.M.? It surely never could be Lindley Murray; for I\nsaw him at York in 1825; and besides, I do not think he Would do such a\nthing; at least, not to a brother grammarian: for you know, gentlemen, that\nSpinosa wrote a very respectable Hebrew grammar.",
        "Hobbes, but why, or on what principle, I never could understand, was not\nmurdered. This was a capital oversight of the professional men in the\nseventeenth century; because in every light he was a fine subject for\nmurder, except, indeed, that he was lean and skinny; for I can prove that\nhe had money, and (what is very funny,) he had no right to make the least\nresistance; for, according to himself, irresistible power creates the very\nhighest species of right, so that it is rebellion of the blackest die\nto refuse to be murdered, when a competent force appears to murder you.\nHowever, gentlemen, though he was not murdered, I am happy to assure you\nthat (by his own account) he was three times very near being murdered. The\nfirst time was in the spring of 1640, when he pretends to have circulated\na little MS. on the king’s behalf, against the Parliament; he never could\nproduce this MS., by the by; but he says that, “Had not his Majesty\ndissolved the Parliament,” (in May,) “it had brought him into danger of his\nlife.” Dissolving the Parliament, however, was of no use; for, in November\nof the same year, the Long Parliament assembled, and Hobbes, a second time,\nfearing he should be murdered, ran away to France. This looks like the\nmadness of John Dennis, who thought that Louis XIV. would never make peace\nwith Queen Anne, unless he were given up to his vengeance; and actually ran\naway from the sea-coast in that belief. In France, Hobbes managed to take\ncare of his throat pretty well for ten years; but at the end of that time,\nby way of paying court to Cromwell, he published his Leviathan. The old\ncoward now began to “funk” horribly for the third time; he fancied the\nswords of the cavaliers were constantly at his throat, recollecting how\nthey had served the Parliament ambassadors at the Hague and Madrid. “Turn,\"\nsays he, in his dog-Latin life of himself,",
        "  “Tum venit in mentem mihi Dorislaus et Ascham;\n  Tanquam proscripto terror ubique aderat.”",
        "And accordingly he ran home to England. Now, certainly, it is very true\nthat a man deserved a cudgelling for writing Leviathan; and two or three\ncudgellings for writing a pentameter ending so villanously as–\"terror\nubique aderat!” But no man ever thought him worthy of anything beyond\ncudgelling. And, in fact, the whole story is a bounce of his own. For, in a\nmost abusive letter which he wrote “to a learned person,” (meaning Wallis\nthe mathematician,) he gives quite another account of the matter, and says\n(p. 8,) he ran home “because he would not trust his safety with the French\nclergy;” insinuating that he was likely to be murdered for his religion,\nwhich would have been a high joke indeed–Tom’s being brought to the stake\nfor religion.",
        "Bounce or not bounce, however, certain it is, that Hobbes, to the end of\nhis life, feared that somebody would murder him. This is proved by the\nstory I am going to tell you: it is not from a manuscript, but, (as Mr.\nColeridge says,) it is as good as manuscript; for it comes from a book\nnow entirely forgotten, viz., “The Creed of Mr. Hobbes Examined; in a\nConference between him and a Student in Divinity,” (published about ten\nyears before Hobbes’s death.) The book is anonymous, but it was written by\nTennison, the same who, about thirty years after, succeeded Tillotson as\nArchbishop of Canterbury. The introductory anecdote is as follows: “A\ncertain divine, it seems, (no doubt Tennison himself,) took an annual tour\nof one month to different parts of the island. In one of these excursions\n(1670) he visited the Peak in Derbyshire, partly in consequence of Hobbes’s\ndescription of it. Being in that neighborhood, he could not but pay a visit\nto Buxton; and at the very moment of his arrival, he was fortunate enough\nto find a party of gentlemen dismounting at the inn door, amongst whom was\na long thin fellow, who turned out to be no less a person than Mr. Hobbes,\nwho probably had ridden over from Chattsworth. Meeting so great a lion,–a\ntourist, in search of the picturesque, could do no less than present\nhimself in the character of bore. And luckily for this scheme, two of Mr.\nHobbes’s companions were suddenly summoned away by express; so that, for\nthe rest of his stay at Buxton, he had Leviathan entirely to himself, and\nhad the honor of bowsing with him in the evening. Hobbes, it seems, at\nfirst showed a good deal of stiffness, for he was shy of divines; but this\nwore off, and he became very sociable and funny, and they agreed to go into\nthe bath together. How Tennison could venture to gambol in the same water\nwith Leviathan, I cannot explain; but so it was: they frolicked about like\ntwo dolphins, though Hobbes must have been as old as the hills; and\n\"in those intervals wherein they abstained from swimming and plunging\nthemselves,” [i.e., diving,] “they discoursed of many things relating to\nthe Baths of the Ancients, and the Origine of Springs. When they had in\nthis manner passed away an hour, they stepped out of the bath; and, having\ndried and cloathed themselves, they sate down in expectation of such a\nsupper as the place afforded; designing to refresh themselves like the\nDeipnosophilæ, and rather to reason than to drink profoundly. But in this\ninnocent intention they were interrupted by the disturbance arising from a\nlittle quarrel, in which some of the ruder people in the house were for a\nshort time engaged. At this Mr. Hobbes seemed much concerned, though he was\nat some distance from the persons.” And why was he concerned, gentlemen?\nNo doubt you fancy, from, some benign and disinterested love of peace and\nharmony, worthy of an old man and a philosopher. But listen–\"For a while\nhe was not composed, but related it once or twice as to himself, with a\nlow and careful tone, how Sextus Roscius was murthered after supper by\nthe Balneæ Palatinæ. Of such general extent is that remark of Cicero, in\nrelation to Epicurus the Atheist, of whom he observed that he of all men\ndreaded most those things which he contemned–Death and the Gods.” Merely\nbecause it was supper time, and in the neighborhood of a bath, Mr. Hobbes\nmust have the fate of Sextus Roscius. What logic was there in this, unless\nto a man who was always dreaming of murder? Here was Leviathan, no\nlonger afraid of the daggers of English cavaliers or French clergy, but\n\"frightened from his propriety” by a row in an ale-house between some\nhonest clod-hoppers of Derbyshire, whom his own gaunt scare-crow of a\nperson that belonged to quite another century, would have frightened out of\ntheir wits.",
        "Malebranche, it will give you pleasure to hear, was murdered. The man who\nmurdered him is well known: it was Bishop Berkeley. The story is familiar,\nthough hitherto not put in a proper light. Berkeley, when a young man, went\nto Paris and called on Père Malebranche. He found him in his cell cooking.\nCooks have ever been a genus irritabile; authors still more so:\nMalebranche was both: a dispute arose; the old father, warm already, became\nwarmer; culinary and metaphysical irritations united to derange his liver:\nhe took to his bed, and died. Such is the common version of the story:\n\"So the whole ear of Denmark is abused.” The fact is, that the matter was\nhushed up, out of consideration for Berkeley, who (as Pope remarked) had\n\"every virtue under heaven:” else it was well known that Berkeley, feeling\nhimself nettled by the waspishness of the old Frenchman, squared at him; a\nturn-up was the consequence: Malebranche was floored in the first round;\nthe conceit was wholly taken out of him; and he would perhaps have given\nin; but Berkeley’s blood was now up, and he insisted on the old Frenchman’s\nretracting his doctrine of Occasional Causes. The vanity of the man was too\ngreat for this; and he fell a sacrifice to the impetuosity of Irish youth,\ncombined with his own absurd obstinacy.",
        "Leibnitz, being every way superior to Malebranche, one might, a fortiori,\nhave counted on his being murdered; which, however, was not the case. I\nbelieve he was nettled at this neglect, and felt himself insulted by the\nsecurity in which he passed his days. In no other way can I explain\nhis conduct at the latter end of his life, when he chose to grow very\navaricious, and to hoard up large sums of gold, which he kept in his\nown house. This was at Vienna, where he died; and letters are still in\nexistence, describing the immeasurable anxiety which he entertained for his\nthroat. Still his ambition, for being attempted at least, was so\ngreat, that he would not forego the danger. A late English pedagogue, of\nBirmingham manufacture, viz., Dr. Parr, took a more selfish course, under\nthe same circumstances. He had amassed a considerable quantity of gold and\nsilver plate, which was for some time deposited in his bed-room at his\nparsonage house, Hatton. But growing every day more afraid of being\nmurdered, which he knew that he could not stand, (and to which, indeed, he\nnever had the slightest pretension,) he transferred the whole to the Hatton\nblacksmith; conceiving, no doubt, that the murder of a blacksmith would\nfall more lightly on the salus reipublicæ, than that of a pedagogue. But\nI have heard this greatly disputed; and it seems now generally agreed, that\none good horse-shoe is worth about 2 1/4 Spital sermons.",
        "As Leibnitz, though not murdered, may be said to have died, partly of\nthe fear that he should be murdered, and partly of vexation that he was\nnot,–Kant, on the other hand–who had no ambition in that way–had a\nnarrower escape from a murderer than any man we read of, except Des Cartes.\nSo absurdly does fortune throw about her favors! The case is told, I think,\nin an anonymous life of this very great man. For health’s sake, Kant\nimposed upon himself, at one time, a walk of six miles every day along a\nhighroad. This fact becoming known to a man who had his private reasons for\ncommitting murder, at the third milestone from Königsberg, he waited for\nhis “intended,” who came up to time as duly as a mail-coach. But for an\naccident, Kant was a dead man. However, on considerations of “morality,” it\nhappened that the murderer preferred a little child, whom he saw playing in\nthe road, to the old transcendentalist: this child he murdered; and thus it\nhappened that Kant escaped. Such is the German account of the matter; but\nmy opinion is–that the murderer was an amateur, who felt how little would\nbe gained to the cause of good taste by murdering an old, arid, and adust\nmetaphysician; there was no room for display, as the man could not possibly\nlook more like a mummy when dead, than he had done alive.",
        "Thus, gentlemen, I have traced the connection between philosophy and our\nart, until insensibly I find that I have wandered into our own era. This I\nshall not take any pains to characterize apart from that which preceded\nit, for, in fact, they have no distinct character. The seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries, together with so much of the nineteenth as we have\nyet seen, jointly compose the Augustan age of murder. The finest work of\nthe seventeenth century is, unquestionably, the murder of Sir Edmondbury\nGodfrey, which has my entire approbation. At the same time, it must be\nobserved, that the quantity of murder was not great in this century, at\nleast amongst our own artists; which, perhaps, is attributable to the want\nof enlightened patronage. Sint Mæcenates, non deerunt, Flacce, Marones.\nConsulting Grant’s “Observations on the Bills of Mortality,” (4th edition,\nOxford, 1665,) I find, that out of 229,250, who died in London during one\nperiod of twenty years in the seventeenth century, not more than eighty-six\nwere murdered; that is, about four three-tenths per annum. A small number\nthis, gentlemen, to found an academy upon; and certainly, where the\nquantity is so small, we have a right to expect that the quality should be\nfirst-rate. Perhaps it was; yet, still I am of opinion that the best artist\nin this century was not equal to the best in that which followed. For\ninstance, however praiseworthy the case of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey may be\n(and nobody can be more sensible of its merits than I am), still I cannot\nconsent to place it on a level with that of Mrs. Ruscombe of Bristol,\neither as to originality of design, or boldness and breadth of style. This\ngood lady’s murder took place early in the reign of George III., a reign\nwhich was notoriously favorable to the arts generally. She lived in College\nGreen, with a single maid-servant, neither of them having any pretension\nto the notice of history but what they derived from the great artist whose\nworkmanship I am recording. One fine morning, when all Bristol was alive\nand in motion, some suspicion arising, the neighbors forced an entrance\ninto the house, and found Mrs. Ruscombe murdered in her bed-room, and the\nservant murdered on the stairs: this was at noon; and, not more than two\nhours before, both mistress and servant had been seen alive. To the best of\nmy remembrance, this was in 1764; upwards of sixty years, therefore, have\nnow elapsed, and yet the artist is still undiscovered. The suspicions of\nposterity have settled upon two pretenders–a baker and a chimney-sweeper.\nBut posterity is wrong; no unpractised artist could have conceived so bold\nan idea as that of a noon-day murder in the heart of a great city. It was\nno obscure baker, gentlemen, or anonymous chimney-sweeper, be assured, that\nexecuted this work. I know who it was. (Here there was a general buzz,\nwhich at length broke out into open applause; upon which the lecturer\nblushed, and went on with much earnestness.) For Heaven’s sake, gentlemen,\ndo not mistake me; it was not I that did it. I have not the vanity to think\nmyself equal to any such achievement; be assured that you greatly overrate\nmy poor talents; Mrs. Ruscombe’s affair was far beyond my slender\nabilities. But I came to know who the artist was, from a celebrated\nsurgeon, who assisted at his dissection. This gentleman had a private\nmuseum in the way of his profession, one corner of which was occupied by a\ncast from a man of remarkably fine proportions.",
        "“That,” said the surgeon, “is a cast from the celebrated Lancashire\nhighwayman, who concealed his profession for some time from his neighbors,\nby drawing woollen stockings over his horse’s legs, and in that way\nmuffling the clatter which he must else have made in riding up a flagged\nalley that led to his stable. At the time of his execution for highway\nrobbery, I was studying under Cruickshank: and the man’s figure was\nso uncommonly fine, that no money or exertion was spared to get into\npossession of him with the least possible delay. By the connivance of the\nunder-sheriff he was cut down within the legal time, and instantly put into\na chaise and four; so that, when he reached Cruickshank’s he was positively\nnot dead. Mr. ––, a young student at that time, had the honor of giving\nhim the coup de grâce, and finishing the sentence of the law.” This\nremarkable anecdote, which seemed to imply that all the gentlemen in the\ndissecting-room were amateurs of our class, struck me a good deal; and I\nwas repeating it one day to a Lancashire lady, who thereupon informed me,\nthat she had herself lived in the neighborhood of that highwayman, and well\nremembered two circumstances, which combined, in the opinion of all his\nneighbors, to fix upon him the credit of Mrs. Ruscombe’s affair. One was,\nthe fact of his absence for a whole fortnight at the period of that murder:\nthe other, that, within a very little time after, the neighborhood of this\nhighwayman was deluged with dollars: now Mrs. Ruscombe was known to have\nhoarded about two thousand of that coin. Be the artist, however, who he\nmight, the affair remains a durable monument of his genius; for such was\nthe impression of awe, and the sense of power left behind, by the strength\nof conception manifested in this murder, that no tenant (as I was told in\n1810) had been found up to that time for Mrs. Ruscombe’s house.",
        "But, whilst I thus eulogize the Ruscombian case, let me not be supposed to\noverlook the many other specimens of extraordinary merit spread over the\nface of this century. Such cases, indeed, as that of Miss Bland, or of\nCaptain Donnellan, and Sir Theophilus Boughton, shall never have any\ncountenance from me. Fie on these dealers in poison, say I: can they not\nkeep to the old honest way of cutting throats, without introducing such\nabominable innovations from Italy? I consider all these poisoning cases,\ncompared with the legitimate style, as no better than wax-work by the side\nof sculpture, or a lithographic print by the side of a fine Volpato. But,\ndismissing these, there remain many excellent works of art in a pure style,\nsuch as nobody need be ashamed to own, as every candid connoisseur will\nadmit. Candid, observe, I say; for great allowances must be made in\nthese cases; no artist can ever be sure of carrying through his own fine\npreconception. Awkward disturbances will arise; people will not submit to\nhave their throats cut quietly; they will run, they will kick, they will\nbite; and whilst the portrait painter often has to complain of too much\ntorpor in his subject, the artist, in our line, is generally embarrassed by\ntoo much animation. At the same time, however disagreeable to the artist,\nthis tendency in murder to excite and irritate the subject, is certainly\none of its advantages to the world in general, which we ought not to\noverlook, since it favors the development of latent talent. Jeremy Taylor\nnotices with admiration, the extraordinary leaps which people will take\nunder the influence of fear. There was a striking instance of this in the\nrecent case of the M’Keands; the boy cleared a height, such as he will\nnever clear again to his dying day. Talents also of the most brilliant\ndescription for thumping, and indeed for all the gymnastic exercises,\nhave sometimes been developed by the panic which accompanies our artists;\ntalents else buried and hid under a bushel to the possessors, as much as to\ntheir friends. I remember an interesting illustration of this fact, in a\ncase which I learned in Germany.",
        "Riding one day in the neighborhood of Munich, I overtook a distinguished\namateur of our society, whose name I shall conceal. This gentleman informed\nme that, finding himself wearied with the frigid pleasures (so he\ncalled them) of mere amateurship, he had quitted England for the\ncontinent–meaning to practise a little professionally. For this purpose\nhe resorted to Germany, conceiving the police in that part of Europe to be\nmore heavy and drowsy than elsewhere. His debut as a practitioner took\nplace at Mannheim; and, knowing me to be a brother amateur, he freely\ncommunicated the whole of his maiden adventure. “Opposite to my lodging,\"\nsaid he, “lived a baker: he was somewhat of a miser, and lived quite alone.\nWhether it were his great expanse of chalky face, or what else, I know\nnot–but the fact was, I ’fancied’ him, and resolved to commence business\nupon his throat, which by the way he always carried bare–a fashion which\nis very irritating to my desires. Precisely at eight o’clock in the\nevening, I observed that he regularly shut up his windows. One night I\nwatched him when thus engaged–bolted in after him–locked the door–and,\naddressing him with great suavity, acquainted him with the nature of my\nerrand; at the same time advising him to make no resistance, which would be\nmutually unpleasant. So saying, I drew out my tools; and was proceeding to\noperate. But at this spectacle, the baker, who seemed to have been struck\nby catalepsy at my first announce, awoke into tremendous agitation. ’I will\nnot be murdered!’ he shrieked aloud; ’what for will I lose my precious\nthroat?’ ’What for?’ said I; ’if for no other reason, for this–that you\nput alum into your bread. But no matter, alum or no alum, (for I was\nresolved to forestall any argument on that point,) know that I am a\nvirtuoso in the art of murder–am desirous of improving myself in its\ndetails–and am enamored of your vast surface of throat, to which I am\ndetermined to be a customer.’ ’Is it so?’ said he, ’but I’ll find you\ncustom in another line;’ and so saying, he threw himself into a boxing\nattitude. The very idea of his boxing struck me as ludicrous. It is true,\na London baker had distinguished himself in the ring, and became known\nto fame under the title of the Master of the Rolls; but he was young and\nunspoiled: whereas this man was a monstrous feather-bed in person, fifty\nyears old, and totally out of condition. Spite of all this, however, and\ncontending against me, who am a master in the art, he made so desperate a\ndefence, that many times I feared he might turn the tables upon me;\nand that I, an amateur, might be murdered by a rascally baker. What a\nsituation! Minds of sensibility will sympathize with my anxiety. How severe\nit was, you may understand by this, that for the first thirteen rounds the\nbaker had the advantage. Round the fourteenth, I received a blow on\nthe right eye, which closed it up; in the end, I believe, this was my\nsalvation: for the anger it roused in me was so great that, in this and\nevery one of the three following rounds, I floored the baker.",
        "“Round 18th. The baker came up piping, and manifestly the worse for wear.\nHis geometrical exploits in the four last rounds had done him no good.\nHowever, he showed some skill in stopping a message which I was sending to\nhis cadaverous mug; in delivering which, my foot slipped, and I went down.",
        "“Round 19th. Surveying the baker, I became ashamed of having been so\nmuch bothered by a shapeless mass of dough; and I went in fiercely,\nand administered some severe punishment. A rally took place–both went\ndown–baker undermost–ten to three on amateur.",
        "“Round 20th. The baker jumped up with surprising agility; indeed, he\nmanaged his pins capitally, and fought wonderfully, considering that he was\ndrenched in perspiration; but the shine was now taken out of him, and his\ngame was the mere effect of panic. It was now clear that he could not last\nmuch longer. In the course of this round we tried the weaving system, in\nwhich I had greatly the advantage, and hit him repeatedly on the conk.\nMy reason for this was, that his conk was covered with carbuncles; and I\nthought I should vex him by taking such liberties with his conk, which in\nfact I did.",
        "“The three next rounds, the master of the rolls staggered about like a cow\non the ice. Seeing how matters stood, in round twenty-fourth I whispered\nsomething into his ear, which sent him down like a shot. It was nothing\nmore than my private opinion of the value of his throat at an annuity\noffice. This little confidential whisper affected him greatly; the very\nperspiration was frozen on his face, and for the next two rounds I had it\nall my own way. And when I called time for the twenty-seventh round, he\nlay like a log on the floor.”",
        "After which, said I to the amateur, “It may be presumed that you\naccomplished your purpose.” “You are right,” said he mildly, “I did; and a\ngreat satisfaction, you know, it was to my mind, for by this means I killed\ntwo birds with one stone;” meaning that he had both thumped the baker and\nmurdered him. Now, for the life of me, I could not see that; for, on the\ncontrary, to my mind it appeared that he had taken two stones to kill one\nbird, having been obliged to take the conceit out of him first with his\nfist, and then with his tools. But no matter for his logic. The moral of\nhis story was good, for it showed what an astonishing stimulus to latent\ntalent is contained in any reasonable prospect of being murdered. A\npursy, unwieldy, half cataleptic baker of Mannheim had absolutely fought\nsix-and-twenty rounds with an accomplished English boxer merely upon this\ninspiration; so greatly was natural genius exalted and sublimed by the\ngenial presence of his murderer.",
        "Really, gentlemen, when one hears of such things as these, it becomes a\nduty, perhaps, a little to soften that extreme asperity with which most\nmen speak of murder. To hear people talk, you would suppose that all the\ndisadvantages and inconveniences were on the side of being murdered, and\nthat there were none at all in not being murdered. But considerate men\nthink otherwise. “Certainly,” says Jeremy Taylor, “it is a less temporal\nevil to fall by the rudeness of a sword than the violence of a fever: and\nthe axe” (to which he might have added the ship-carpenter’s mallet and the\ncrow-bar) “a much less affliction than a strangury.” Very true; the\nbishop talks like a wise man and an amateur, as he is; and another great\nphilosopher, Marcus Aurelius, was equally above the vulgar prejudices on\nthis subject. He declares it to be one of “the noblest functions of reason\nto know whether it is time to walk out of the world or not.” (Book III.,\nCollers’ Translation.) No sort of knowledge being rarer than this, surely\nthat man must be a most philanthropic character, who undertakes to\ninstruct people in this branch of knowledge gratis, and at no little hazard\nto himself. All this, however, I throw out only in the way of speculation\nto future moralists; declaring in the meantime my own private conviction,\nthat very few men commit murder upon philanthropic or patriotic principles,\nand repeating what I have already said once at least–that, as to the\nmajority of murderers, they are very incorrect characters.",
        "With respect to Williams’s murders, the sublimest and most entire in their\nexcellence that ever were committed, I shall not allow myself to speak\nincidentally. Nothing less than an entire lecture, or even an entire course\nof lectures, would suffice to expound their merits. But one curious fact,\nconnected with his case, I shall mention, because it seems to imply that\nthe blaze of his genius absolutely dazzled the eye of criminal justice. You\nall remember, I doubt not, that the instruments with which he executed his\nfirst great work, (the murder of the Marrs,) were a ship-carpenter’s mallet\nand a knife. Now the mallet belonged to an old Swede, one John Petersen,\nand bore his initials. This instrument Williams left behind him, in Marr’s\nhouse, and it fell into the hands of the magistrates. Now, gentlemen, it\nis a fact that the publication of this circumstance of the initials led\nimmediately to the apprehension of Williams, and, if made earlier, would\nhave prevented his second great work, (the murder of the Williamsons,)\nwhich took place precisely twelve days after. But the magistrates kept back\nthis fact from the public for the entire twelve days, and until that second\nwork was accomplished. That finished, they published it, apparently feeling\nthat Williams had now done enough for his fame, and that his glory was at\nlength placed beyond the reach of accident.",
        "As to Mr. Thurtell’s case, I know not what to say. Naturally, I have every\ndisposition to think highly of my predecessor in the chair of this society;\nand I acknowledge that his lectures were unexceptionable. But, speaking\ningenuously, I do really think that his principal performance, as an\nartist, has been much overrated. I admit that at first I was myself carried\naway by the general enthusiasm. On the morning when the murder was made\nknown in London, there was the fullest meeting of amateurs that I have ever\nknown since the days of Williams; old bed-ridden connoisseurs, who had got\ninto a peevish way of sneering and complaining “that there was nothing\ndoing,” now hobbled down to our club-room: such hilarity, such benign\nexpression of general satisfaction, I have rarely witnessed. On every side\nyou saw people shaking hands, congratulating each other, and forming\ndinner parties for the evening; and nothing was to be heard but triumphant\nchallenges of–\"Well! will this do?” “Is this the right thing?” “Are\nyou satisfied at last?” But, in the midst of this, I remember we all\ngrew silent on hearing the old cynical amateur, L. S––, that laudator\ntemporis acti, stumping along with his wooden leg; he entered the room\nwith his usual scowl, and, as he advanced, he continued to growl and\nstutter the whole way–\"Not an original idea in the whole piece–mere\nplagiarism,–base plagiarism from hints that I threw out! Besides, his\nstyle is as hard as Albert Durer, and as coarse as Fuseli.” Many thought\nthat this was mere jealousy, and general waspishness; but I confess that,\nwhen the first glow of enthusiasm had subsided, I have found most judicious\ncritics to agree that there was something falsetto in the style of\nThurtell. The fact is, he was a member of our society, which naturally gave\na friendly bias to our judgments; and his person was universally familiar\nto the cockneys, which gave him, with the whole London public, a temporary\npopularity, that his pretensions are not capable of supporting; for\nopinionum commenta delet dies, naturæ judicia confirmat. There was,\nhowever, an unfinished design of Thurtell’s for the murder of a man with a\npair of dumb-bells, which I admired greatly; it was a mere outline, that he\nnever completed; but to my mind it seemed every way superior to his chief\nwork. I remember that there was great regret expressed by some amateurs\nthat this sketch should have been left in an unfinished state: but there\nI cannot agree with them; for the fragments and first bold outlines of\noriginal artists have often a felicity about them which is apt to vanish in\nthe management of the details.",
        "The case of the M’Keands I consider far beyond the vaunted performance of\nThurtell,–indeed above all praise; and bearing that relation, in fact, to\nthe immortal works of Williams, which the Æneid bears to the Iliad.",
        "But it is now time that I should say a few words about the principles of\nmurder, not with a view to regulate your practice, but your judgment: as\nto old women, and the mob of newspaper readers, they are pleased with\nanything, provided it is bloody enough. But the mind of sensibility\nrequires something more. First, then, let us speak of the kind of person\nwho is adapted to the purpose of the murderer; secondly, of the place\nwhere; thirdly, of the time when, and other little circumstances.",
        "As to the person, I suppose it is evident that he ought to be a good man;\nbecause, if he were not, he might himself, by possibility, be contemplating\nmurder at the very time; and such “diamond-cut-diamond” tussles, though\npleasant enough where nothing better is stirring, are really not what a\ncritic can allow himself to call murders. I could mention some people (I\nname no names) who have been murdered by other people in a dark lane; and\nso far all seemed correct enough; but, on looking farther into the matter,\nthe public have become aware that the murdered party was himself, at the\nmoment, planning to rob his murderer, at the least, and possibly to murder\nhim, if he had been strong enough. Whenever that is the case, or may be\nthought to be the case, farewell to all the genuine effects of the art. For\nthe final purpose of murder, considered as a fine art, is precisely the\nsame as that of tragedy, in Aristotle’s account of it, viz., “to cleanse\nthe heart by means of pity and terror.” Now, terror there may be, but how\ncan there be any pity for one tiger destroyed by another tiger?",
        "It is also evident that the person selected ought not to be a public\ncharacter. For instance, no judicious artist would have attempted to murder\nAbraham Newland. For the case was this; everybody read so much about\nAbraham Newland, and so few people ever saw him, that there was a fixed\nbelief that he was an abstract idea. And I remember that once, when I\nhappened to mention that I had dined at a coffee-house in company with\nAbraham Newland, everybody looked scornfully at me, as though I had\npretended to have played at billiards with Prester John, or to have had an\naffair of honor with the Pope. And, by the way, the Pope would be a very\nimproper person to murder: for he has such a virtual ubiquity as the father\nof Christendom, and, like the cuckoo, is so often heard but never seen,\nthat I suspect most people regard him also as an abstract idea. Where,\nindeed, a public character is in the habit of giving dinners, “with every\ndelicacy of the season,” the case is very different: every person is\nsatisfied that he is no abstract idea; and, therefore, there can be no\nimpropriety in murdering him; only that his murder will fall into the class\nof assassinations, which I have not yet treated.",
        "Thirdly. The subject chosen ought to be in good health: for it is\nabsolutely barbarous to murder a sick person, who is usually quite unable\nto bear it. On this principle, no cockney ought to be chosen who is above\ntwenty-five, for after that age he is sure to be dyspeptic. Or at least, if\na man will hunt in that warren, he ought to murder a couple at one time; if\nthe cockneys chosen should be tailors, he will of course think it his duty,\non the old established equation, to murder eighteen. And, here, in this\nattention to the comfort of sick people, you will observe the usual effect\nof a fine art to soften and refine the feelings. The world in general,\ngentlemen, are very bloody-minded; and all they want in a murder is a\ncopious effusion of blood; gaudy display in this point is enough for\nthem. But the enlightened connoisseur is more refined in his taste;\nand from our art, as from all the other liberal arts when thoroughly\ncultivated, the result is–to improve and to humanize the heart; so true is\nit, that–",
        "  ––\"Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes,\n  Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros.”",
        "A philosophic friend, well known for his philanthropy and general\nbenignity, suggests that the subject chosen ought also to have a family of\nyoung children wholly dependent on his exertions, by way of deepening the\npathos. And, undoubtedly, this is a judicious caution. Yet I would not\ninsist too keenly on this condition. Severe good taste unquestionably\ndemands it; but still, where the man was otherwise unobjectionable in point\nof morals and health, I would not look with too curious a jealousy to a\nrestriction which might have the effect of narrowing the artist’s sphere.",
        "So much for the person. As to the time, the place, and the tools, I have\nmany things to say, which at present I have no room for. The good sense of\nthe practitioner has usually directed him to night and privacy. Yet\nthere have not been wanting cases where this rule was departed from with\nexcellent effect. In respect to time, Mrs. Ruscombe’s case is a beautiful\nexception, which I have already noticed; and in respect both to time and\nplace, there is a fine exception in the annals of Edinburgh, (year 1805,)\nfamiliar to every child in Edinburgh, but which has unaccountably been\ndefrauded of its due portion of fame amongst English amateurs. The case\nI mean is that of a porter to one of the banks, who was murdered whilst\ncarrying a bag of money, in broad daylight, on turning out of the High\nStreet, one of the most public streets in Europe, and the murderer is to\nthis hour undiscovered.",
        "  “Sed fugit interea, fugit irreparabile tcmpus,\n  Singula dum capti circumvectamur amore.”",
        "And now, gentlemen, in conclusion, let me again solemnly disclaim all\npretensions on my own part to the character of a professional man. I never\nattempted any murder in my life, except in the year 1801, upon the body of\na tom-cat; and that turned out differently from my intention. My\npurpose, I own, was downright murder. “Semper ego auditor tantum?” said I,\n\"nunquamne reponam?” And I went down stairs in search of Tom at one o’clock\non a dark night, with the “animus,” and no doubt with the fiendish looks,\nof a murderer. But when I found him, he was in the act of plundering the\npantry of bread and other things. Now this gave a new turn to the affair;\nfor the time being one of general scarcity, when even Christians were\nreduced to the use of potato-bread, rice-bread, and all sorts of things, it\nwas downright treason in a tom-cat to be wasting good wheaten-bread in the\nway he was doing. It instantly became a patriotic duty to put him to death;\nand as I raised aloft and shook the glittering steel, I fancied myself\nrising like Brutus, effulgent from a crowd of patriots, and, as I stabbed\nhim, I",

        "Since then, what wandering thoughts I may have had of attempting the life\nof an ancient ewe, of a superannuated hen, and such “small deer,” are\nlocked up in the secrets of my own breast; but for the higher departments\nof the art, I confess myself to be utterly unfit. My ambition does not rise\nso high. No, gentlemen, in the words of Horace,",

        "DOCTOR NORTH: You are a liberal man: liberal in the true classical sense,\nnot in the slang sense of modern politicians and education-mongers. Being\nso, I am sure that you will sympathize with my case. I am an ill-used man,\nDr. North–particularly ill used; and, with your permission, I will briefly\nexplain how. A black scene of calumny will be laid open; but you, Doctor,\nwill make all things square again. One frown from you, directed to the\nproper quarter, or a warning shake of the crutch, will set me right in\npublic opinion, which at present, I am sorry to say, is rather hostile to\nme and mine–all owing to the wicked arts of slanderers. But you shall\nhear.",
        "A good many years ago you may remember that I came forward in the character\nof a dilettante in murder. Perhaps dilettante may be too strong a word.\nConnoisseur is better suited to the scruples and infirmity of public\ntaste. I suppose there is no harm in that at least. A man is not bound\nto put his eyes, ears, and understanding into his breeches pocket when he\nmeets with a murder. If he is not in a downright comatose state, I suppose\nhe must see that one murder is better or worse than another in point of\ngood taste. Murders have their little differences and shades of merit as\nwell as statues, pictures, oratorios, cameos, intaglios, or what not. You\nmay be angry with the man for talking too much, or too publicly, (as to the\ntoo much, that I deny–a man can never cultivate his taste too highly;) but\nyou must allow him to think, at any rate; and you, Doctor, you think, I am\nsure, both deeply and correctly on the subject. Well, would you believe it?\nall my neighbors came to hear of that little æsthetic essay which you had\npublished; and, unfortunately, hearing at the very same time of a club that\nI as connected with, and a dinner at which I presided–both tending to the\nsame little object as the essay, viz., the diffusion of a just taste among\nher majesty’s subjects, they got up the most barbarous calumnies against\nme. In particular, they said that I, or that the club, which comes to the\nsame thing, had offered bounties on well conducted homicides–with a scale\nof drawbacks, in case of any one defect or flaw, according to a table\nissued to private friends. Now, Doctor, I’ll tell you the whole truth about\nthe dinner and the club, and you’ll see how malicious the world is. But\nfirst let me tell you, confidentially, what my real principles are upon the\nmatters in question.",
        "As to murder, I never committed one in my life. It’s a well known thing\namongst all my friends. I can get a paper to certify as much, signed by\nlots of people. Indeed, if you come to that, I doubt whether many\npeople could produce as strong a certificate. Mine would be as big as a\ntable-cloth. There is indeed one member of the club, who pretends to say\nthat he caught me once making too free with his throat on a club night,\nafter every body else had retired. But, observe, he shuffles in his story\naccording to his state of civilation. When not far gone, he contents\nhimself with saying that he caught me ogling his throat; and that I was\nmelancholy for some weeks after, and that my voice sounded in a way\nexpressing, to the nice ear of a connoisseur, the sense of opportunities\nlost–but the club all know that he’s a disappointed man himself, and that\nhe speaks querulously at times about the fatal neglect of a man’s coming\nabroad without his tools. Besides, all this is an affair between two\namateurs, and every body makes allowances for little asperities\nand sorenesses in such a case. “But,” say you, “If no murderer, my\ncorrespondent may have encouraged, or even have bespoke a murder.” No, upon\nmy honor–nothing of the kind. And that was the very point I wished to\nargue for your satisfaction. The truth is, I am a very particular man in\neverything relating to murder; and perhaps I carry my delicacy too far. The\nStagyrite most justly, and possibly with a view to my case, placed virtue\nin the [Greek: to meson] or middle point between two extremes. A golden\nmean is certainly what every man should aim at. But it is easier talking\nthan doing; and, my infirmity being notoriously too much milkiness of\nheart, I find it difficult to maintain that steady equatorial line between\nthe two poles of too much murder on the one hand, and too little on the\nother. I am too soft–Doctor, too soft; and people get excused through\nme–nay, go through life without an attempt made upon them, that ought not\nto be excused. I believe if I had the management of things, there would\nhardly be a murder from year’s end to year’s end. In fact I’m for virtue,\nand goodness, and all that sort of thing. And two instances I’ll give you\nto what an extremity I carry my virtue. The first may seem a trifle; but\nnot if you knew my nephew, who was certainly born to be hanged, and would\nhave been so long ago, but for my restraining voice. He is horribly\nambitious, and thinks himself a man of cultivated taste in most branches of\nmurder, whereas, in fact, he has not one idea on the subject, but such\nas he has stolen from me. This is so well known, that the club has twice\nblackballed him, though every indulgence was shown to him as my relative.\nPeople came to me and said–\"Now really, President, we would do much to\nserve a relative of yours. But still, what can be said? You know yourself\nthat he’ll disgrace us. If we were to elect him, why, the next thing we\nshould hear of would be some vile butcherly murder, by way of justifying\nour choice. And what sort of a concern would it be? You know, as well as we\ndo, that it would be a disgraceful affair, more worthy of the shambles than\nof an artist’s attelier. He would fall upon some great big man, some huge\nfarmer returning drunk from a fair. There would be plenty of blood, and\nthat he would expect us to take in lieu of taste, finish, scenical\ngrouping. Then, again, how would he tool? Why, most probably with a cleaver\nand a couple of paving stones: so that the whole coup d’oeil would remind\nyou rather of some hideous ogre or cyclops, than of the delicate operator\nof the nineteenth century.” The picture was drawn with the hand of truth;\nthat I could not but allow, and, as to personal feelings in the matter, I\ndismissed them from the first. The next morning I spoke to my nephew–I was\ndelicately situated, as you see, but I determined that no consideration\nshould induce me to flinch from my duty. “John,” said I, “you seem to me to\nhave taken an erroneous view of life and its duties. Pushed on by ambition,\nyou are dreaming rather of what it might be glorious to attempt, than what\nit would be possible for you to accomplish. Believe me, it is not necessary\nto a man’s respectability that he should commit a murder. Many a man has\npassed through life most respectably, without attempting any species of\nhomicide–good, bad, or indifferent. It is your first duty to ask yourself,\nquid valeant humeri, quid ferre recusent? we cannot all be brilliant men\nin this life. And it is for your interest to be contented rather with a\nhumble station well filled, than to shock every body with failures, the\nmore conspicuous by contrast with the ostentation of their promises.” John\nmade no answer, he looked very sulky at the moment, and I am in high\nhopes that I have saved a near relation from making a fool of himself by\nattempting what is as much beyond his capacity as an epic poem. Others,\nhowever, tell me that he is meditating a revenge upon me and the whole\nclub. But let this be as it may, liberavi animam meam; and, as you see,\nhave run some risk with a wish to diminish the amount of homicide. But the\nother case still more forcibly illustrates my virtue. A man came to me as\na candidate for the place of my servant, just then vacant. He had the\nreputation of having dabbled a little in our art; some said not without\nmerit. What startled me, however, was, that he supposed this art to be\npart of his regular duties in my service. Now that was a thing I would not\nallow; so I said at once, “Richard (or James, as the case might be,) you\nmisunderstand my character. If a man will and must practise this difficult\n(and allow me to add, dangerous) branch of art–if he has an overruling\ngenius for it, why, he might as well pursue his studies whilst living in my\nservice as in another’s. And also, I may observe, that it can do no harm\neither to himself or to the subject on whom he operates, that he should\nbe guided by men of more taste than himself. Genius may do much, but long\nstudy of the art must always entitle a man to offer advice. So far I will\ngo–general principles I will suggest. But as to any particular case, once\nfor all I will have nothing to do with it. Never tell me of any special\nwork of art you are meditating–I set my face against it in toto. For if\nonce a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think\nlittle of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and\nSabbath-breaking, and from that to incivility and procrastination. Once\nbegin upon this downward path, you never know where you are to stop. Many\na man has dated his ruin from some murder or other that perhaps he thought\nlittle of at the time. Principiis obsta–that’s my rule.” Such was my\nspeech, and I have always acted up to it; so if that is not being virtuous,\nI should be glad to know what is. But now about the dinner and the club.\nThe club was not particularly of my creation; it arose pretty much as other\nsimilar associations, for the propagation of truth and the communication of\nnew ideas, rather from the necessities of things than upon any one man’s\nsuggestion. As to the dinner, if any man more than another could be held\nresponsible for that, it was a member known amongst us by the name of\nToad-in-the-hole. He was so called from his gloomy misanthropical\ndisposition, which led him into constant disparagements of all modern\nmurders as vicious abortions, belonging to no authentic school of art. The\nfinest performances of our own age he snarled at cynically; and at length\nthis querulous humor grew upon him so much, and he became so notorious as a\nlaudator tentporis acti, that few people cared to seek his society. This\nmade him still more fierce and truculent. He went about muttering and\ngrowling; wherever you met him he was soliloquizing and saying, “despicable\npretender–without grouping–without two ideas upon handling–without\"–and\nthere you lost him. At length existence seemed to be painful to him;\nhe rarely spoke, he seemed conversing with phantoms in the air, his\nhousekeeper informed us that his reading was nearly confined to God’s\nRevenge upon Murder, by Reynolds, and a more ancient book of the same\ntitle, noticed by Sir Walter Scott in his Fortunes of Nigel. Sometimes,\nperhaps, he might read in the Newgate Calendar down to the year 1788, but\nhe never looked into a book more recent. In fact, he had a theory with\nregard to the French Revolution, as having been the great cause of\ndegeneration in murder. “Very soon, sir,” he used to say, “men will have\nlost the art of killing poultry: the very rudiments of the art will\nhave perished!” In the year 1811 he retired from general society.\nToad-in-the-hole was no more seen in any public resort. We missed him from\nhis wonted haunts–nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he. By the side of\nthe main conduit his listless length at noontide he would stretch, and pore\nupon the filth that muddled by. “Even dogs are not what they were, sir–not\nwhat they should be. I remember in my grandfather’s time that some dogs had\nan idea of murder. I have known a mastiff lie in ambush for a rival, sir,\nand murder him with pleasing circumstances of good taste. Yes, sir, I knew\na tom-cat that was an assassin. But now\"–and then, the subject growing too\npainful, he dashed his hand to his forehead, and went off abruptly in a\nhomeward direction towards his favorite conduit, where he was seen by an\namateur in such a state that he thought it dangerous to address him. Soon\nafter he shut himself entirely up; it was understood that he had resigned\nhimself to melancholy; and at length the prevailing notion was, that\nToad-in-the-hole had hanged himself.",
        "The world was wrong there, as it has been on some other questions.\nToad-in-the-hole might be sleeping, but dead he was not; and of that we\nsoon had ocular proof. One morning in 1812, an amateur surprised us with\nthe news that he had seen Toad-in-the-hole brushing with hasty steps the\ndews away to meet the postman by the conduit side. Even that was something:\nhow much more, to hear that he had shaved his beard–had laid aside his\nsad-colored clothes, and was adorned like a bridegroom of ancient days.\nWhat could be the meaning of all this? Was Toad-in-the-hole mad? or how?\nSoon after the secret was explained–in more than a figurative sense\n\"the murder was out.” For in came the London morning papers, by which\nit appeared that but three days before a murder, the most superb of the\ncentury by many degrees had occurred in the heart of London. I need hardly\nsay, that this was the great exterminating chef-d’oeuvre of Williams at\nMr. Marr’s, No. 29, Ratcliffe Highway. That was the début of the artist;\nat least for anything the public knew. What occurred at Mr. Williamson’s\ntwelve nights afterwards–the second work turned out from the same\nchisel–some people pronounced even superior. But Toad-in-the-hole always\n\"reclaimed\"–he was even angry at comparisons. “This vulgar gout de\ncomparaison, as La Bruyère calls it,” he would often remark, “will be\nour ruin; each work has its own separate characteristics–each in and for\nitself is incomparable. One, perhaps, might suggest the Iliad–the other\nthe Odyssey: what do you get by such comparisons? Neither ever was, or\nwill be surpassed; and when you’ve talked for hours, you must still come\nback to that.” Vain, however, as all criticism might be, he often said that\nvolumes might be written on each case for itself; and he even proposed to\npublish in quarto on the subject.",
        "Meantime, how had Toad-in-the-hole happened to hear of this great work\nof art so early in the morning? He had received an account by express,\ndispatched by a correspondent in London, who watched the progress of art On\nToady’s behalf, with a general commission to send off a special express,\nat whatever cost, in the event of any estimable works appearing–how much\nmore upon occasion of a ne plus ultra in art! The express arrived in the\nnight-time; Toad-in-the-hole was then gone to bed; he had been muttering\nand grumbling for hours, but of course he was called up. On reading the\naccount, he threw his arms round the express, called him his brother and\nhis preserver; settled a pension upon him for three lives, and expressed\nhis regret at not having it in his power to knight him. We, on our part–we\namateurs, I mean–having heard that he was abroad, and therefore had nothanged himself, made sure of soon seeing him amongst us. Accordingly he\nsoon arrived, knocked over the porter on his road to the reading-room; he\nseized every man’s hand as he passed him–wrung it almost frantically, and\nkept ejaculating, “Why, now here’s something like a murder!–this is the\nreal thing–this is genuine–this is what you can approve, can recommend to\na friend: this–says every man, on reflection–this is the thing that ought\nto be!” Then, looking at particular friends, he said–\"Why, Jack, how are\nyou? Why, Tom, how are you? Bless me, you look ten years younger than\nwhen I last saw you.” “No, sir,” I replied, “It is you who look ten years\nyounger.” “Do I? well, I should’nt wonder if I did; such works are\nenough to make us all young.” And in fact the general opinion is, that\nToad-in-the-hole would have died but for this regeneration of art, which\nhe called a second age of Leo the Tenth; and it was our duty, he said\nsolemnly, to commemorate it. At present, and en attendant–rather as an\noccasion for a public participation in public sympathy, than as in itself\nany commensurate testimony of our interest–he proposed that the club\nshould meet and dine together. A splendid public dinner, therefore, was\ngiven by the club; to which all amateurs were invited from a distance of\none hundred miles.",
        "Of this dinner there are ample short-hand notes amongst the archives of\nthe club. But they are not “extended,” to speak diplomatically; and the\nreporter is missing–I believe, murdered. Meantime, in years long after\nthat day, and on an occasion perhaps equally interesting, viz., the turning\nup of Thugs and Thuggism, another dinner was given. Of this I myself kept\nnotes, for fear of another accident to the short-hand reporter. And I here\nsubjoin them. Toad-in-the-hole, I must mention, was present at this dinner.\nIn fact, it was one of its sentimental incidents. Being as old as the\nvalleys at the dinner of 1812, naturally he was as old as the hills at the\nThug dinner of 1838. He had taken to wearing his beard again; why, or with\nwhat view, it passes my persimmon to tell you. But so it was. And his\nappearance was most benign and venerable. Nothing could equal the angelic\nradiance of his smile as he inquired after the unfortunate reporter, (whom,\nas a piece of private scandal, I should tell you that he was himself\nsupposed to have murdered, in a rapture of creative art:) the answer was,\nwith roars of laughter, from the under-sheriff of our county–\"Non est\ninventus.” Toad-in-the-hole laughed outrageously at this: in fact, we all\nthought he was choking; and, at the earnest request of the company, a\nmusical composer furnished a most beautiful glee upon the occasion,\nwhich was sung five times after dinner, with universal applause and\ninextinguishable laughter, the words being these, (and the chorus\nso contrived, as most beautifully to mimic the peculiar laughter of\nToad-in-the-hole:)–",
        "  “Et interrogatum est à Toad-in-the hole–Ubi est ille reporter?\n  Et responsum est cum cachinno–Non est inventus.”",
        "Chorus.",
        "  “Deinde iteratum est ab omnibus, cum cachinnatione undulante–\n  Non est inventus.”",
        "Toad-in-the-hole, I ought to mention, about nine years before, when an\nexpress from Edinburgh brought him the earliest intelligence of the\nBurke-and-Hare revolution in the art, went mad upon the spot; and, instead\nof a pension to the express for even one life, or a knighthood, endeavored\nto burke him; in consequence of which he was put into a strait waistcoat.\nAnd that was the reason we had no dinner then. But now all of us were alive\nand kicking, strait-waistcoaters and others; in fact, not one absentee\nwas reported upon the entire roll. There were also many foreign amateurs\npresent.",
        "Dinner being over, and the cloth drawn, there was a general call made for\nthe new glee of Non est inventus; but, as this would have interfered with\nthe requisite gravity of the company during the earlier toasts, I overruled\nthe call. After the national toasts had been given, the first official\ntoast of the day was, The Old Man of the Mountains–drunk in solemn\nsilence.",
        "Toad-in-the-hole returned thanks in a neat speech. He likened himself to\nthe Old Man of the Mountains, in a few brief allusions, that made the\ncompany absolutely yell with laughter; and he concluded with giving the\nhealth of",
        "Mr. Von Hammer, with many thanks to him for his learned History of the\nOld Man and his subjects the assassins.",
        "Upon this I rose and said, that doubtless most of the company were aware\nof the distinguished place assigned by orientalists to the very learned\nTurkish scholar Von Hammer the Austrian; that he had made the profoundest\nresearches into our art as connected with those early and eminent artists\nthe Syrian assassins in the period of the Crusaders; that his work had been\nfor several years deposited, as a rare treasure of art, in the library\nof the club. Even the author’s name, gentlemen, pointed him out as the\nhistorian of our art–Von Hammer–",
        "“Yes, yes,” interrupted Toad-in-the-hole, who never can sit still–\"Yes,\nyes, Von Hammer–he’s the man for a malleus hæreticorum: think rightly\nof our art, or he’s the man to tickle your catastrophes. You all know what\nconsideration Williams bestowed on the hammer, or the ship carpenter’s\nmallet, which is the same thing. Gentlemen, I give you another great\nhammer–Charles the Hammer, the Marteau, or, in old French, the Martel–he\nhammered the Saracens till they were all as dead as door-nails–he did,\nbelieve me.”",
        "“Charles Martel, with all the honors.”",
        "But the explosion of Toad-in-the-hole, together with the uproarious cheers\nfor the grandpapa of Charlemagne, had now made the company unmanageable.\nThe orchestra was again challenged with shouts the stormiest for the new\nglee. I made again a powerful effort to overrule the challenge. I might\nas well have talked to the winds. I foresaw a tempestuous evening; and I\nordered myself to be strengthened with three waiters on each side; the\nvice-president with as many. Symptoms of unruly enthusiasm were beginning\nto show out; and I own that I myself was considerably excited as the\norchestra opened with its storm of music, and the impassioned glee\nbegan–\"Et interrogatum est à Toad-in-the-hole–Ubi est ille Reporter?\"\nAnd the frenzy of the passion became absolutely convulsing, as the full\nchorus fell in–\"Et iteratum est ab omnibus–Non est inventus”",
        "By this time I saw how things were going: wine and music were making most\nof the amateurs wild. Particularly Toad-in-the-hole, though considerably\nabove a hundred years old, was getting as vicious as a young leopard. It\nwas a fixed impression with the company that he had murdered the reporter\nin the year 1812; since which time (viz. twenty-six years) “ille reporter\"\nhad been constantly reported “Non est inventus.” Consequently, the glee\nabout himself, which of itself was most tumultuous and jubilant, carried\nhim off his feet. Like the famous choral songs amongst the citizens of\nAbdera, nobody could hear it without a contagious desire for falling back\ninto the agitating music of “Et interrogatum est à Toad-in-the-hole,” &c.\nI enjoined vigilance upon my assessors, and the business of the evening\nproceeded.",
        "The next toast was–The Jewish Sicarii.",
        "Upon which I made the following explanation to the company:–\"Gentlemen,\nI am sure it will interest you all to hear that the assassins, ancient as\nthey were, had a race of predecessors in the very same country. All over\nSyria, but particularly in Palestine, during the early years of the Emperor\nNero, there was a band of murderers, who prosecuted their studies in a very\nnovel manner. They did not practise in the night-time, or in lonely places;\nbut justly considering that great crowds are in themselves a sort of\ndarkness by means of the dense pressure and the impossibility of finding\nout who it was that gave the blow, they mingled with mobs everywhere;\nparticularly at the great paschal feast in Jerusalem; where they actually\nhad the audacity, as Josephus assures us, to press into the temple,–and\nwhom should they choose for operating upon but Jonathan himself, the\nPontifex Maximus? They murdered him, gentlemen, as beautifully as if they\nhad had him alone on a moonless night in a dark lane. And when it was\nasked, who was the murderer, and where he was\"–",
        "“Why, then, it was answered,” interrupted Toad-in-the-hole, ’Non est\ninventus.” And then, in spite of all I could do or say, the\norchestra opened, and the whole company began–\"Et interrogatum est à\nToad-in-the-hole–Ubi est ille Sicarius? Et responsum est ab omnibus–Non\nest inventus.”",
        "When the tempestuous chorus had subsided, I began again:–\"Gentlemen, you\nwill find a very circumstantial account of the Sicarii in at least three\ndifferent parts of Josephus; once in Book XX. sect. v. c. 8, of his\nAntiquities; once in Book I. of his Wars: but in sect. 10 of the\nchapter first cited you will find a particular description of their\ntooling. This is what he says–’They tooled with small scymetars not much\ndifferent from the Persian acinacæ, but more curved, and for all the\nworld most like the Roman sickles or sicæ.’ It is perfectly magnificent,\ngentlemen, to hear the sequel of their history. Perhaps the only case\non record where a regular army of murderers was assembled, a justus\nexercitus, was in the case of these Sicarii. They mustered in such\nstrength in the wilderness, that Festus himself was obliged to march\nagainst them with the Roman legionary force.”",
        "Upon which Toad-in-the-hole, that cursed interrupter, broke out\na-singing–\"Et interrogatum est à Toad-in-the-hole–Ubi est ille exercitus?\nEt responsum est ab omnibus–Non est inventus.”",
        "“No, no, Toad–you are wrong for once: that army was found, and was all\ncut to pieces in the desert. Heavens, gentlemen, what a sublime picture!\nThe Roman legions–the wilderness–Jerusalem in the distance–an army of\nmurderers in the foreground!”",
        "Mr. R., a member, now gave the next toast–\"To the further improvement of\nTooling, and thanks to the Committee for their services.”",
        "Mr. L., on behalf of the committee who had reported on that subject,\nreturned thanks. He made an interesting extract from the report, by which\nit appeared how very much stress had been laid formerly on the mode of\ntooling, by the fathers, both Greek and Latin. In confirmation of this\npleasing fact, he made a very striking statement in reference to the\nearliest work of antediluvian art. Father Mersenne, that learned Roman\nCatholic, in page one thousand four hundred and thirty-one[1] of his\noperose Commentary on Genesis, mentions, on the authority of several\nrabbis, that the quarrel of Cain with Abel was about a young woman; that,\nby various accounts, Cain had tooled with his teeth, [Abelem fuisse\nmorsibus dilaceratum à Cain;] by many others, with the jaw-bone of an\nass; which is the tooling adopted by most painters. But it is pleasing to\nthe mind of sensibility to know that, as science expanded, sounder views\nwere adopted. One author contends for a pitchfork, St. Chrysostom for a\nsword, Irenæus for a scythe, and Prudentius for a hedging-bill. This last\nwriter delivers his opinion thus:–",
        "  “Frater, probatæ sanctitatis æmulus,\n  Germana curvo colla frangit sarculo:”",
        "i.e. his brother, jealous of his attested sanctity, fractures his\nbrotherly throat with a curved hedging-bill. “All which is respectfully\nsubmitted by your committee, not so much as decisive of the question, (for\nit is not,) but in order to impress upon the youthful mind the importance\nwhich has ever been attached to the quality of the tooling by such men as\nChrysostom and Irenæus.”",
        "[Footnote 1: “Page one thousand four hundred and thirty-one\"–literally,\ngood reader, and no joke at all.]",
        "“Dang Irenæus!” said Toad-in-the-hole, who now rose impatiently to give the\nnext toast:–\"Our Irish friends; and a speedy revolution in their mode of\ntooling, as well as everything else connected with the art!”",
        "“Gentlemen, I’ll tell you the plain truth. Every day of the year we take\nup a paper, we read the opening of a murder. We say, this is good, this\nis charming, this is excellent! But, behold you! scarcely have we read a\nlittle farther, before the word Tipperary or Ballina-something betrays the\nIrish manufacture. Instantly we loath it; we call to the waiter; we say,\nWaiter, take away this paper; send it out of the house; it is absolutely\noffensive to all just taste.’ I appeal to every man whether, on finding a\nmurder (otherwise perhaps promising enough) to be Irish, he does not feel\nhimself as much insulted as when Madeira being ordered, he finds it to be\nCape; or when, taking up what he takes to be a mushroom, it turns out\nwhat children call a toad-stool. Tithes, politics, or something wrong in\nprinciple, vitiate every Irish murder. Gentlemen, this must be reformed, or\nIreland will not be a land to live in; at least, if we do live there, we\nmust import all our murders, that’s clear.” Toad-in-the-hole sat\ndown growling with suppressed wrath, and the universal “Hear, hear!\"\nsufficiently showed that he spoke the general feeling.",
        "The next toast was–\"The sublime epoch of Burkism and Harism!”",
        "This was drunk with enthusiasm; and one of the members, who spoke to the\nquestion, made a very curious communication to the company:–\"Gentlemen,\nwe fancy Burkism to be a pure invention of our own times: and in fact no\nPancirollus has ever enumerated this branch of art when writing de rebus\ndeperditis. Still I have ascertained that the essential principle of the\nart was known to the ancients, although like the art of painting upon\nglass, of making the myrrhine cups, &c., it was lost in the dark ages for\nwant of encouragement. In the famous collection of Greek epigrams made\nby Planudes is one upon a very charming little case of Burkism: it is a\nperfect little gem of art. The epigram itself I cannot lay my hand upon at\nthis moment, but the following is an abstract of it by Salmasius, as I find\nit in his notes on Vopiscus: ’Est et elegans epigramma Lucilii, (well\nhe might call it “elegans!”) ubi medicus et pollinctor de compacto sic\negerunt, ut medicus ægros omnes curæ suæ commissos occideret:’ this was\nthe basis of the contract, you see, that on the one part the doctor, for\nhimself and his assigns, doth undertake and contract duly and truly to\nmurder all the patients committed to his charge: but why? There lies the\nbeauty of the case–’Et ut pollinctori amico suo traderet pollingendos.’\nThe pollinctor, you are aware, was a person whose business it was to\ndress and prepare dead bodies for burial. The original ground of the\ntransaction appears to have been sentimental: ’He was my friend,’ says the\nmurderous doctor; ’he was dear to me,’ in speaking of the pollinctor. But\nthe law, gentlemen, is stern and harsh: the law will not hear of these\ntender motives: to sustain a contract of this nature in law, it is\nessential that a ’consideration’ should be given. Now what was the\nconsideration? For thus far all is on the side of the pollinctor: he\nwill be well paid for his services; but, meantime, the generous, the\nnoble-minded doctor gets nothing. What was the little consideration\nagain, I ask, which the law would insist on the doctor’s taking? You shall\nhear: ’Et ut pollinctor vicissim [Greek: telamonas] quos furabatur de\npollinctione mortuorum medico mitteret doni ad alliganda vulnera eorurn\nquos curabat.’ Now, the case is clear: the whole went on a principle of\nreciprocity which would have kept up the trade for ever. The doctor was\nalso a surgeon: he could not murder all his patients: some of the\nsurgical patients must be retained intact; re infectâ. For these he\nwanted linen bandages. But, unhappily, the Romans wore woollen, on which\naccount they bathed so often. Meantime, there was linen to be had in\nRome; but it was monstrously dear; and the [Greek: telamones] or linen\nswathing bandages, in which superstition obliged them to bind up corpses,\nwould answer capitally for the surgeon. The doctor, therefore, contracts to\nfurnish his friend with a constant succession of corpses, provided, and be\nit understood always, that his said friend in return should supply him with\none half of the articles he would receive from the friends of the parties\nmurdered or to be murdered. The doctor invariably recommended his\ninvaluable friend the pollinctor, (whom let us call the undertaker;) the\nundertaker, with equal regard to the sacred rights of friendship, uniformly\nrecommended the doctor. Like Pylades and Orestes, they were models of a\nperfect friendship: in their lives they were lovely, and on the gallows, it\nis to be hoped, they were not divided.",
        "“Gentlemen, it makes me laugh horribly, when I think of those two friends\ndrawing and redrawing on each other: ’Pollinctor in account with Doctor,\ndebtor by sixteen corpses; creditor by forty-five bandages, two of which\ndamaged.’ Their names unfortunately are lost; but I conceive they must have\nbeen Quintus Burkius and Publius Harius. By the way, gentlemen, has anybody\nheard lately of Hare? I understand he is comfortably settled in Ireland,\nconsiderably to the west, and does a little business now and then; but, as\nhe observes with a sigh, only as a retailer–nothing like the fine thriving\nwholesale concern so carelessly blown up at Edinburgh. ’You see what comes\nof neglecting business,’–is the chief moral, the [Greek: epimutheon],\nas Æsop would say, which he draws from his past experience.”",
        "At length came the toast of the day–Thugdom in all its branches.",
        "The speeches attempted at this crisis of the dinner were past all\ncounting. But the applause was so furious, the music so stormy, and the\ncrashing of glasses so incessant, from the general resolution never again\nto drink an inferior toast from the same glass, that my power is not equal\nto the task of reporting. Besides which, Toad-in-the-hole now became quite\nungovernable. He kept firing pistols in every direction; sent his servant\nfor a blunderbuss, and talked of loading with ball-cartridge. We conceived\nthat his former madness had returned at the mention of Burke and Hare; or\nthat, being again weary of life, he had resolved to go off in a general\nmassacre. This we could not think of allowing: it became indispensable,\ntherefore, to kick him out, which we did with universal consent, the whole\ncompany lending their toes uno pede, as I may say, though pitying his\ngray hairs and his angelic smile. During the operation the orchestra poured\nin their old chorus. The universal company sang, and (what surprised us\nmost of all) Toad-in-the-hole joined us furiously in singing–",
        "  “Et interrogatum est ab omnibus–Ubi est ille Toad-in-the-hole\n  Et responsum est ab omnibus–Non est inventus.”",
        "IN REFERENCE TO M. MICHELET’S HISTORY OF FRANCE.",
        "What is to be thought of her? What is to be thought of the poor shepherd\ngirl from the hills and forests of Lorraine, that–like the Hebrew shepherd\nboy from the hills and forests of Judæa–rose suddenly out of the quiet,\nout of the safety, out of the religious inspiration, rooted in deep\npastoral solitudes, to a station in the van of armies, and to the more\nperilous station at the right hand of kings? The Hebrew boy inaugurated his\npatriotic mission by an act, by a victorious act, such as no man could\ndeny. But so did the girl of Lorraine, if we read her story as it was read\nby those who saw her nearest. Adverse armies bore witness to the boy as no\npretender: but so they did to the gentle girl. Judged by the voices of all\nwho saw them from a station of good will, both were found true and loyal\nto any promises involved in their first acts. Enemies it was that made the\ndifference between their subsequent fortunes. The boy rose–to a splendor\nand a noon-day prosperity, both personal and public, that rang through the\nrecords of his people, and became a byeword amongst his posterity for a\nthousand years, until the sceptre was departing from Judah. The poor,\nforsaken girl, on the contrary, drank not herself from that cup of rest\nwhich she had secured for France. She never sang together with the songs\nthat rose in her native Domrémy, as echoes to the departing steps of\ninvaders. She mingled not in the festal dances at Vaucouleurs which\ncelebrated in rapture the redemption of France. No! for her voice was then\nsilent: No! for her feet were dust. Pure, innocent, noble-hearted girl!\nwhom, from earliest youth, ever I believed in as full of truth and\nself-sacrifice, this was amongst the strongest pledges for thy side,\nthat never once–no, not for a moment of weakness–didst thou revel in the\nvision of coronets and honor from man. Coronets for thee! O no! Honors, if\nthey come when all is over, are for those that share thy blood.[2] Daughter\nof Domrémy, when the gratitude of thy king shall awaken, thou wilt be\nsleeping the sleep of the dead. Call her, King of France, but she will not\nhear thee! Cite her by thy apparitors to come and receive a robe of honor,\nbut she will be found en contumace. When the thunders of universal\nFrance, as even yet may happen, shall proclaim the grandeur of the poor\nshepherd girl that gave up all for her country–thy ear, young shepherd\ngirl, will have been deaf for five centuries. To suffer and to do, that was\nthy portion in this life; to do–never for thyself, always for others;\nto suffer–never in the persons of generous champions, always in thy\nown–that was thy destiny; and not for a moment was it hidden from thyself.\nLife, thou saidst, is short: and the sleep which is in the grave, is long!\nLet me use that life, so transitory, for the glory of those heavenly dreams\ndestined to comfort the sleep which is so long. This pure creature–pure\nfrom every suspicion of even a visionary self-interest, even as she was\npure in senses more obvious–never once did this holy child, as regarded\nherself, relax from her belief in the darkness that was travelling to meet\nher. She might not prefigure the very manner of her death; she saw not in\nvision, perhaps, the aërial altitude of the fiery scaffold, the spectators\nwithout end on every road pouring into Rouen as to a coronation, the\nsurging smoke, the volleying flames, the hostile faces all around, the\npitying eye that lurked but here and there until nature and imperishable\ntruth broke loose from artificial restraints; these might not be apparent\nthrough the mists of the hurrying future. But the voice that called her to\ndeath, that she heard for ever.",
        "Great was the throne of France even in those days, and great was he that\nsate upon it: but well Joanna knew that not the throne, nor he that sate\nupon it, was for her; but, on the contrary, that she was for them; not\nshe by them, but they by her, should rise from the dust. Gorgeous were\nthe lilies of France, and for centuries had the privilege to spread their\nbeauty over land and sea, until, in another century, the wrath of God and\nman combined to wither them; but well Joanna knew, early at Domrémy she had\nread that bitter truth, that the lilies of France would decorate no garland\nfor her. Flower nor bud, bell nor blossom, would ever bloom for her.",
        "But stop. What reason is there for taking up this subject of Joanna\nprecisely in this spring of 1847? Might it not have been left till the\nspring of 1947? or, perhaps, left till called for? Yes, but it is called\nfor; and clamorously. You are aware, reader, that amongst the many original\nthinkers, whom modern France has produced, one of the reputed leaders is M.\nMichelet. All these writers are of a revolutionary cast; not in a political\nsense merely, but in all senses; mad, oftentimes, as March hares; crazy\nwith the laughing-gas of recovered liberty; drunk with the wine-cup of\ntheir mighty Revolution, snorting, whinnying, throwing up their heels, like\nwild horses in the boundless pampas, and running races of defiance with\nsnipes, or with the winds, or with their own shadows, if they can find\nnothing else to challenge. Some time or other, I, that have leisure to\nread, may introduce you, that have not, to two or three dozen of these\nwriters; of whom I can assure you beforehand that they are often profound,\nand at intervals are even as impassioned as if they were come of our best\nEnglish blood, and sometimes (because it is not pleasant that people should\nbe too easy to understand) almost as obscure as if they had been suckled\nby transcendental German nurses. But now, confining our attention to M.\nMichelet–who is quite sufficient to lead a man into a gallop, requiring\ntwo relays, at least, of fresh readers,–we in England–who know him best\nby his worst book, the book against Priests, &c., which has been most\ncirculated–know him disadvantageously. That book is a rhapsody of\nincoherence. M. Michelet was light-headed, I believe, when he wrote it:\nand it is well that his keepers overtook him in time to intercept a second\npart. But his History of France is quite another thing. A man, in\nwhatsoever craft he sails, cannot stretch away out of sight when he is\nlinked to the windings of the shore by towing ropes of history. Facts, and\nthe consequences of facts, draw the writer back to the falconer’s lure from\nthe giddiest heights of speculation. Here, therefore–in his France,–if\nnot always free from flightiness, if now and then off like a rocket for\nan airy wheel in the clouds, M. Michelet, with natural politeness, never\nforgets that he has left a large audience waiting for him on earth, and\ngazing upwards in anxiety for his return: return, therefore, he does. But\nHistory, though clear of certain temptations in one direction, has separate\ndangers of its own. It is impossible so to write a History of France, or\nof England–works becoming every hour more indispensable to the\ninevitably-political man of this day–without perilous openings for\nassault. If I, for instance, on the part of England, should happen to turn\nmy labors into that channel, and (on the model of Lord Percy going to Chevy\nChase)–",
        "  ––\"A vow to God should make\n  My pleasure in the Michelet woods\n  Three summer days to take,”",
        "–probably from simple delirium, I might hunt M. Michelet into delirium\ntremens. Two strong angels stand by the side of History, whether French\nHistory or English, as heraldic supporters: the angel of Research on the\nleft hand, that must read millions of dusty parchments, and of pages\nblotted with lies; the angel of Meditation on the right hand, that must\ncleanse these lying records with fire, even as of old the draperies of\nasbestos were cleansed, and must quicken them into regenerated life.\nWillingly I acknowledge that no man will ever avoid innumerable errors of\ndetail: with so vast a compass of ground to traverse, this is impossible:\nbut such errors (though I have a bushel on hand, at M. Michelet’s service)\nare not the game I chase: it is the bitter and unfair spirit in which\nM. Michelet writes against England. Even that, after all, is but my\nsecondary object: the real one is Joanna, the Pucelle d’Orleans for\nherself.",
        "I am not going to write the History of La Pucelle: to do this, or even\ncircumstantially to report the history of her persecution and bitter death,\nof her struggle with false witnesses and with ensnaring judges, it would\nbe necessary to have before us all the documents, and, therefore, the\ncollection only now forthcoming in Paris. But my purpose is narrower.\nThere have been great thinkers, disdaining the careless judgments of\ncontemporaries, who have thrown themselves boldly on the judgment of a far\nposterity, that should have had time to review, to ponder, to compare.\nThere have been great actors on the stage of tragic humanity that might,\nwith the same depth of confidence, have appealed from the levity of\ncompatriot friends–too heartless for the sublime interest of their story,\nand too impatient for the labor of sifting its perplexities–to the\nmagnanimity and justice of enemies. To this class belongs the Maid of Arc.\nThe Romans were too faithful to the ideal of grandeur in themselves not\nto relent, after a generation or two, before the grandeur of Hannibal.\nMithridates–a more doubtful person–yet, merely for the magic perseverance\nof his indomitable malice, won from the same Romans the only real honor\nthat ever he received on earth. And we English have ever shown the same\nhomage to stubborn enmity. To work unflinchingly for the ruin of England;\nto say through life, by word and by deed–Delenda est Anglia Victrix!\nthat one purpose of malice, faithfully pursued, has quartered some people\nupon our national funds of homage as by a perpetual annuity. Better than an\ninheritance of service rendered to England herself, has sometimes proved\nthe most insane hatred to England. Hyder Ali, even his far inferior son\nTippoo, and Napoleon, have all benefited by this disposition amongst\nourselves to exaggerate the merit of diabolic enmity. Not one of these men\nwas ever capable, in a solitary instance, of praising an enemy–[what\ndo you say to that, reader?] and yet in their behalf, we consent to\nforget, not their crimes only, but (which is worse) their hideous bigotry\nand anti-magnanimous egotism; for nationality it was not. Suffrein, and\nsome half dozen of other French nautical heroes, because rightly they did\nus all the mischief they could, [which was really great] are names justly\nreverenced in England. On the same principle, La Pucelle d’Orleans, the\nvictorious enemy of England, has been destined to receive her deepest\ncommemoration from the magnanimous justice of Englishmen.",
        "Joanna, as we in England should call her, but, according to her own\nstatement, Jeanne (or, as M. Michelet asserts, Jean[3]) d’Arc, was born at\nDomrémy, a village on the marshes of Lorraine and Champagne, and dependent\nupon the town of Vaucouleurs. I have called her a Lorrainer, not simply\nbecause the word is prettier, but because Champagne too odiously reminds\nus English of what are for us imaginary wines, which, undoubtedly, La\nPucelle tasted as rarely as we English; we English, because the Champagne\nof London is chiefly grown in Devonshire; La Pucelle, because the\nChampagne of Champagne never, by any chance, flowed into the fountain of\nDomrémy, from which only she drank. M. Michelet will have her to be a\nChampenoise, and for no better reason than that she “took after her\nfather,” who happened to be a Champenoise. I am sure she did not: for\nher father was a filthy old fellow, whom I shall soon teach the judicious\nreader to hate. But, (says M. Michelet, arguing the case physiologically)\n\"she had none of the Lorrainian asperity;” no, it seems she had only “the\ngentleness of Champagne, its simplicity mingled with sense and acuteness,\nas you find it in Joinville.” All these things she had; and she was worth a\nthousand Joinvilles, meaning either the prince so called, or the fine old\ncrusader. But still, though I love Joanna dearly, I cannot shut my eyes\nentirely to the Lorraine element of “asperity” in her nature. No; really\nnow, she must have had a shade of that, though very slightly developed–a\nmere soupçon, as French cooks express it in speaking of cayenne pepper,\nwhen she caused so many of our English throats to be cut. But could she do\nless? No; I always say so; but still you never saw a person kill even a\ntrout with a perfectly “Champagne” face of “gentleness and simplicity,\"\nthough, often, no doubt, with considerable “acuteness.” All your cooks and\nbutchers wear a Lorraine cast of expression.",
        "These disputes, however, turn on refinements too nice. Domrémy stood\nupon the frontiers; and, like other frontiers, produced a mixed race\nrepresenting the cis and the trans. A river (it is true) formed the\nboundary line at this point–the river Meuse; and that, in old days,\nmight have divided the populations; but in these days it did not–there\nwere bridges, there were ferries, and weddings crossed from the right bank\nto the left. Here lay two great roads, not so much for travellers, that\nwere few, as for armies that were too many by half. These two roads, one of\nwhich was the great high road between France and Germany, decussated at\nthis very point; which is a learned way of saying that they formed a St.\nAndrew’s cross, or letter X. I hope the compositor will choose a good large\nX, in which case the point of intersection, the locus of conflux for\nthese four diverging arms, will finish the reader’s geographical education,\nby showing him to a hair’s breadth where it was that Domrémy stood. These\nroads, so grandly situated, as great trunk arteries between two mighty\nrealms,[4] and haunted for ever by wars or rumors of wars, decussated (for\nanything I know to the contrary) absolutely under Joanna’s bed-room window;\none rolling away to the right, past Monsieur D’Arc’s old barn, and the\nother unaccountably preferring (but there’s no disputing about tastes) to\nsweep round that odious man’s odious pigstye to the left.",
        "Things being situated as is here laid down, viz. in respect of the\ndecussation, and in respect of Joanna’s bed-room; it follows that, if she\nhad dropped her glove by accident from her chamber window into the very\nbull’s eye of the target, in the centre of X, not one of several great\npotentates could (though all animated by the sincerest desires for the\npeace of Europe) have possibly come to any clear understanding on the\nquestion of whom the glove was meant for. Whence the candid reader\nperceives at once the necessity for at least four bloody wars. Falling\nindeed a little farther, as, for instance, into the pigstye, the glove\ncould not have furnished to the most peppery prince any shadow of excuse\nfor arming: he would not have had a leg to stand upon in taking such a\nperverse line of conduct. But, if it fell (as by the hypothesis it did)\ninto the one sole point of ground common to four kings, it is clear that,\ninstead of no leg to stand upon, eight separate legs would have had\nno ground to stand upon unless by treading on each other’s toes. The\nphilosopher, therefore, sees clearly the necessity of a war, and regrets\nthat sometimes nations do not wait for grounds of war so solid.",
        "In the circumstances supposed, though the four kings might be unable to\nsee their way clearly without the help of gunpowder to any decision upon\nJoanna’s intention, she–poor thing!–never could mistake her intentions\nfor a moment. All her love was for France; and, therefore, any glove\nshe might drop into the quadrivium must be wickedly missent by the\npost-office, if it found its way to any king but the king of France.",
        "On whatever side of the border chance had thrown Joanna, the same love to\nFrance would have been nurtured. For it is a strange fact, noticed by M.\nMichelet and others, that the Dukes of Bar and Lorraine had for generations\npursued the policy of eternal warfare with France on their own account, yet\nalso of eternal amity and league with France in case anybody else presumed\nto attack her. Let peace settle upon France, and before long you might rely\nupon seeing the little vixen Lorraine flying at the throat of France. Let\nFranco be assailed by a formidable enemy, and instantly you saw a Duke of\nLorraine or Bar insisting on having his throat cut in support of France;\nwhich favor accordingly was cheerfully granted to them in three great\nsuccessive battles by the English and by the Turkish sultan, viz., at\nCrécy, at Nicopolis, and at Agincourt.",
        "This sympathy with France during great eclipses, in those that during\nordinary seasons were always teasing her with brawls and guerilla inroads,\nstrengthened the natural piety to France of those that were confessedly\nthe children of her own house. The outposts of France, as one may call the\ngreat frontier provinces, were of all localities the most devoted to the\nFlours de Lys. To witness, at any great crisis, the generous devotion to\nthese lilies of the little fiery cousin that in gentler weather was for\never tilting at her breast, could not bin fan the zeal of the legitimate\ndaughter: whilst to occupy a post of honor on the frontiers against an old\nhereditary enemy of France, would naturally have stimulated this zeal by a\nsentiment of martial pride, had there even been no other stimulant to zeal\nby a sense of danger always threatening, and of hatred always smouldering.\nThat great four-headed road was a perpetual memento to patriotic ardor.\nTo say, this way lies the road to Paris–and that other way to\nAix-la-Chapelle, this to Prague, that to Vienna–nourished the warfare of\nthe heart by daily ministrations of sense. The eye that watched for the\ngleams of lance or helmet from the hostile frontier, the ear that listened\nfor the groaning of wheels, made the high road itself, with its relations\nto centres so remote, into a manual of patriotic enmity.",
        "The situation, therefore, locally of Joanna was full of profound\nsuggestions to a heart that listened for the stealthy steps of change and\nfear that too surely were in motion. But if the place were grand, the\ntimes, the burthen of the times, was far more so. The air overhead in its\nupper chambers were hurtling with the obscure sound; was dark with sullen\nfermenting of storms that had been gathering for a hundred and thirty\nyears. The battle of Agincourt in Joanna’s childhood had re-opened the\nwounds of France. Crécy and Poictiers, those withering overthrows for the\nchivalry of France, had been tranquillized by more than half a century; but\nthis resurrection of their trumpet wails made the whole series of battles\nand endless skirmishes take their stations as parts in one drama. The\ngraves that had closed sixty years ago, seemed to fly open in sympathy\nwith a sorrow that echoed their own. The monarchy of France labored in\nextremity, rocked and reeled like a ship fighting with the darkness of\nmonsoons. The madness of the poor king (Charles VI.) falling in at such a\ncrisis, like the case of women laboring in childbirth during the storming\nof a city, trebled the awfulness of the time. Even the wild story of\nthe incident which had immediately occasioned the explosion of this\nmadness–the case of a man unknown, gloomy, and perhaps maniacal himself,\ncoming out of a forest at noon-day, laying his hand upon the bridle of\nthe king’s horse, checking him for a moment to say, “Oh, King, thou art\nbetrayed,” and then vanishing no man knew whither, as he had appeared for\nno man knew what–fell in with the universal prostration of mind that laid\nFrance on her knees as before the slow unweaving of some ancient prophetic\ndoom. The famines, the extraordinary diseases, the insurrections of the\npeasantry up and down Europe, these were chords struck from the same\nmysterious harp; but these were transitory chords. There had been others\nof deeper and more sonorous sound. The termination of the Crusades, the\ndestruction of the Templars, the Papal interdicts, the tragedies caused or\nsuffered by the House of Anjou, by the Emperor–these were full of a more\npermanent significance; but since then the colossal figure of feudalism was\nseen standing as it were on tiptoe at Crécy for flight from earth: that was\na revolution unparalleled; yet that was a trifle by comparison with the\nmore fearful revolutions that were mining below the Church. By her own\ninternal schisms, by the abominable spectacle of a double Pope–so that no\nman, except through political bias, could even guess which was Heaven’s\nvicegerent, and which the creature of hell–she was already rehearsing, as\nin still earlier forms she had rehearsed, the first rent in her foundations\n(reserved for the coming century) which no man should ever heal.",
        "These were the loftiest peaks of the cloudland in the skies, that to the\nscientific gazer first caught the colors of the new morning in advance.\nBut the whole vast range alike of sweeping glooms overhead, dwelt upon all\nmeditative minds, even those that could not distinguish the altitudes nor\ndecipher the forms. It was, therefore, not her own age alone, as affected\nby its immediate calamities, that lay with such weight upon Joanna’s mind;\nbut her own age, as one section in a vast mysterious drama, unweaving\nthrough a century back, and drawing nearer continually to crisis after\ncrisis. Cataracts and rapids were heard roaring ahead; and signs were seen\nfar back, by help of old men’s memories, which answered secretly to signs\nnow coming forward on the eye, even as locks answer to keys. It was not\nwonderful that in such a haunted solitude, with such a haunted heart,\nJoanna should see angelic visions, and hear angelic voices. These voices\nwhispered to her the duty imposed upon herself, of delivering France. Five\nyears she listened to these monitory voices with internal struggles. At\nlength she could resist no longer. Doubt gave way; and she left her home in\norder to present herself at the Dauphin’s court.",
        "The education of this poor girl was mean according to the present standard:\nwas ineffably grand, according to a purer philosophic standard; and only\nnot good for our age, because for us it would be unattainable. She read\nnothing, for she could not read; but she had heard others read parts of the\nRoman martyrology. She wept in sympathy with the sad Misereres of the\nRomish chaunting; she rose to heaven with the glad triumphant Gloria in\nExcelcis: she drew her comfort and her vital strength from the rites of\nher church. But, next after these spiritual advantages, she owed most to\nthe advantages of her situation. The fountain of Domrémy was on the brink\nof a boundless forest; and it was haunted to that degree by fairies that\nthe parish priest (curé) was obliged to read mass there once a year, in\norder to keep them in any decent bounds. Fairies are important, even in a\nstatistical view; certain weeds mark poverty in the soil, fairies mark\nits solitude. As surely as the wolf retires before cities, does the fairy\nsequester herself from the haunts of licensed victuallers. A village is too\nmuch for her nervous delicacy: at most, she can tolerate a distant view\nof a hamlet. We may judge, therefore, by the uneasiness and extra trouble\nwhich they gave to the parson, in what strength the fairies mustered at\nDomrémy, and, by a satisfactory consequence, how thinly sown with men and\nwomen must have been that region even in its inhabited spots. But the\nforests of Domrémy–those were the glories of the land: for, in them abode\nmysterious powers and ancient secrets that towered into tragic strength.\n\"Abbeys there were, and abbey windows, dim and dimly seen–as Moorish\ntemples of the Hindoos,” that exercised even princely power both in\nLorraine and in the German Diets. These had their sweet bells that pierced\nthe forests for many a league at matins or vespers, and each its own dreamy\nlegend. Few enough, and scattered enough, were these abbeys, in no degree\nto disturb the deep solitude of the region; many enough to spread a network\nor awning of Christian sanctity over what else might have seemed a heathen\nwilderness. This sort of religious talisman being secured, a man the most\nafraid of ghosts (like myself, suppose, or the reader) becomes armed into\ncourage to wander for days in their sylvan recesses. The mountains of the\nVosges on the eastern frontier of France, have never attracted much notice\nfrom Europe, except in 1813-14, for a few brief months, when they fell\nwithin Napoleon’s line of defence against the Allies. But they are\ninteresting for this, amongst other features–that they do not, like some\nloftier ranges, repel woods: the forests and they are on sociable terms.\nLive and let live is their motto. For this reason, in part, these tracts\nin Lorraine were a favorite hunting ground with the Carlovingian princes.\nAbout six hundred years before Joanna’s childhood, Charlemagne was known to\nhave hunted there. That, of itself, was a grand incident in the traditions\nof a forest or a chase. In these vast forests, also, were to be found (if\nthe race was not extinct) those mysterious fawns that tempted solitary\nhunters into visionary and perilous pursuits. Here was seen, at intervals,\nthat ancient stag who was already nine hundred years old, at the least, but\npossibly a hundred or two more, when met by Charlemagne; and the thing\nwas put beyond doubt by the inscription upon his golden collar. I believe\nCharlemagne knighted the stag; and, if ever he is met again by a king, he\nought to be made an earl–or, being upon the marches of France, a marquess.\nObserve, I don’t absolutely vouch for all these things: my own opinion\nvaries. On a fine breezy forenoon I am audaciously sceptical; but as\ntwilight sets in, my credulity becomes equal to anything that could be\ndesired. And I have heard candid sportsmen declare that, outside of these\nvery forests near the Vosges, they laughed loudly at all the dim tales\nconnected with their haunted solitudes; but, on reaching a spot notoriously\neighteen miles deep within them, they agreed with Sir Roger de Coverley\nthat a good deal might be said on both sides.",
        "Such traditions, or any others that (like the stag) connect distant\ngenerations with each other, are, for that cause, sublime; and the sense of\nthe shadowy, connected with such appearances that reveal themselves or not\naccording to circumstances, leaves a coloring of sanctity over ancient\nforests, even in those minds that utterly reject the legend as a fact.",
        "But, apart from all distinct stories of that order, in any solitary\nfrontier between two great empires, as here, for instance, or in the desert\nbetween Syria and the Euphrates, there is an inevitable tendency, in minds\nof any deep sensibility to people the solitudes with phantom images of\npowers that were of old so vast. Joanna, therefore, in her quiet occupation\nof a shepherdess, would be led continually to brood over the political\ncondition of her country, by the traditions of the past no less than by the\nmementoes of the local present.",
        "M. Michelet, indeed, says that La Pucelle was not a shepherdess. I beg\nhis pardon: she was. What he rests upon, I guess pretty well: it is\nthe evidence of a woman called Haumette, the most confidential friend of\nJoanna. Now, she is a good witness, and a good girl, and I like her; for\nshe makes a natural and affectionate report of Joanna’s ordinary life. But\nstill, however good she may be as a witness, Joanna is better; and\nshe, when speaking to the Dauphin, calls herself in the Latin report\nBergereta. Even Haumette confesses that Joanna tended sheep in her\ngirlhood. And I believe, that, if Miss Haumette were taking coffee alone\nwith me this very evening (February 12, 1847)–in which there would be\nno subject for scandal or for maiden blushes, because I am an intense\nphilosopher, and Miss H. would be hard upon four hundred and fifty years\nold–she would admit the following comment upon her evidence to be right. A\nFrenchman, about thirty years ago, M. Simond, in his Travels, mentioned\nincidentally the following hideous scene as one steadily observed and\nwatched by himself in France at a period some trifle before the French\nRevolution:–A peasant was ploughing; and the team that drew his plough was\na donkey and a woman. Both were regularly harnessed: both pulled alike.\nThis is bad enough: but the Frenchman adds, that, in distributing his\nlashes, the peasant was obviously desirous of being impartial: or, if\neither of the yoke-fellows had a right to complain, certainly it was not\nthe donkey. Now, in any country, where such degradation of females could be\ntolerated by the state of manners, a woman of delicacy would shrink from\nacknowledging, either for herself or her friend, that she had ever been\naddicted to any mode of labor not strictly domestic; because, if once\nowning herself a prædial servant, she would be sensible that this\nconfession extended by probability in the hearer’s thoughts to having\nincurred indignities of this horrible kind. Haumette clearly thinks it more\ndignified for Joanna to have been darning the stockings of her horny-hoofed\nfather, Monsieur D’Arc, than keeping sheep, lest she might then be\nsuspected of having ever done something worse. But, luckily, there was no\ndanger of that: Joanna never was in service; and my opinion is that her\nfather should have mended his own stockings, since probably he was the\nparty to make the holes in them, as many a better man than D’Arc does;\nmeaning by that not myself, because, though certainly a better man than\nD’Arc, I protest against doing anything of the kind. If I lived even with\nFriday in Juan Fernandez, either Friday must do all the darning, or else it\nmust go undone. The better men that I meant were the sailors in the British\nnavy, every man of whom mends his own stockings. Who else is to do it?\nDo you suppose, reader, that the junior lords of the admiralty are under\narticles to darn for the navy?",
        "The reason, meantime, for my systematic hatred of D’Arc is this. There was\na story current in France before the Revolution, framed to ridicule the\npauper aristocracy, who happened to have long pedigrees and short rent\nrolls, viz., that a head of such a house, dating from the Crusades, was\noverheard saying to his son, a Chevalier of St. Louis, ’Chevalier, as-tu\ndonné au cochon à manger!” Now, it is clearly made out by the surviving\nevidence, that D’Arc would much have preferred continuing to say–\"Ma\nfille as-tu donné au cochon à manger?” to saying ’Pucelle d’Orléans,\nas-tu sauvé les fleurs-de-lys?” There is an old English copy of verses\nwhich argues thus:–",
        "  “If the man, that turnips cries,\n  Cry not when his father dies–\n  Then ’tis plain the man had rather\n  Have a turnip than his father.”",
        "I cannot say that the logic of these verses was ever entirely to my\nsatisfaction. I do not see my way through it as clearly as could be wished.\nBut I see my way most clearly through D’Arc; and the result is–that he\nwould greatly have preferred not merely a turnip to his father, but the\nsaving a pound or so of bacon to saving the Oriflamme of France.",
        "It is probable (as M. Michelet suggests) that the title of Virgin, or\nPucelle, had in itself, and apart from the miraculous stones about her,\na secret power over the rude soldiery and partisan chiefs of that period;\nfor, in such a person, they saw a representative manifestation of the\nVirgin Mary, who, in a course of centuries, had grown steadily upon the\npopular heart.",
        "As to Joanna’s supernatural detection of the Dauphin (Charles VII.) amongst\nthree hundred lords and knights. I am surprised at the credulity which\ncould ever lend itself to that theatrical juggle. Who admires more than\nmyself the sublime enthusiasm, the rapturous faith in herself, of this pure\ncreature? But I admire not stage artifices, which not La Pucelle, but the\nCourt, must have arranged; nor can surrender myself a dupe to a conjuror’s\nleger-de-main, such as may be seen every day for a shilling. Southey’s\n\"Joan of Arc” was published in 1796. Twenty years after, talking with\nSouthey, I was surprised to find him still owning a secret bias in favor of\nJoan, founded on her detection of the Dauphin. The story, for the benefit\nof the reader new to the case, was this:–La Pucelle was first made known\nto the Dauphin, and presented to his court, at Chinon: and here came her\nfirst trial. She was to find out the royal personage amongst the whole ark\nof clean and unclean creatures. Failing in this coup d’essai, she would\nnot simply disappoint many a beating heart in the glittering crowd that on\ndifferent motives yearned for her success, but she would ruin herself–and,\nas the oracle within had told her, would ruin France. Our own sovereign\nlady Victoria rehearses annually a trial not so severe in degree, but the\nsame in kind. She “pricks” for sheriffs. Joanna pricked for a king. But\nobserve the difference: our own lady pricks for two men out of three;\nJoanna for one man out of three hundred. Happy Lady of the islands and the\norient!–she can go astray in her choice only by one half; to the extent\nof one half she must have the satisfaction of being right. And yet, even\nwith these tight limits to the misery of a boundless discretion, permit me,\nliege Lady, with all loyalty, to submit–that now and then you prick with\nyour pin the wrong man. But the poor child from Domrémy, shrinking under\nthe gaze of a dazzling court–not because dazzling (for in visions she had\nseen those that were more so,) but because some of them wore a scoffing\nsmile on their features–how should she throw her line into so deep a\nriver to angle for a king, where many a gay creature was sporting that\nmasqueraded as kings in dress? Nay, even more than any true king would have\ndone: for, in Southey’s version of the story, the Dauphin says, by way of\ntrying the virgin’s magnetic sympathy with royalty,",
        "  ––\"on the throne,\n  I the while mingling with the menial throng,\n  Some courtier shall he seated.”",
        "This usurper is even crowned: “the jeweled crown shines on a menial’s\nhead.” But really, that is ’un peu fort;” and the mob of spectators might\nraise a scruple whether our friend the jackdaw upon the throne, and the\nDauphin himself, were not grazing the shins of treason. For the Dauphin\ncould not lend more than belonged to him. According to the popular notion,\nhe had no crown for himself, but, at most, a petit ecu, worth thirty\npence; consequently none to lend, on any pretence whatever, until the\nconsecrated Maid should take him to Rheims. This was the popular notion\nin France. The same notion as to the indispensableness of a coronation\nprevails widely in England. But, certainly, it was the Dauphin’s interest\nto support the popular notion, as he meant to use the services of Joanna.\nFor, if he were king already, what was it that she could do for him beyond\nOrleans? And above all, if he were king without a coronation, and without\nthe oil from the sacred ampulla, what advantage was yet open to him by\ncelerity above his competitor the English boy? Now was to be a race for a\ncoronation: he that should win that race, carried the superstition of\nFrance along with him. Trouble us not, lawyer, with your quillets. We are\nillegal blockheads; so thoroughly without law, that we don’t know even if\nwe have a right to be blockheads; and our mind is made up–that the first\nman drawn from the oven of coronation at Rheims, is the man that is baked\ninto a king. All others are counterfeits, made of base Indian meal, damaged\nby sea-water.",
        "La Pucelle, before she could be allowed to practise as a warrior, was put\nthrough her manual and platoon exercise, as a juvenile pupil in divinity,\nbefore six eminent men in wigs. According to Southey (v. 393, Book III., in\nthe original edition of his “Joan of Arc”) she “appall’d the doctors.” It’s\nnot easy to do that: but they had some reason to feel bothered, as that\nsurgeon would assuredly feel bothered, who, upon proceeding to dissect a\nsubject, should find the subject retaliating as a dissector upon himself,\nespecially if Joanna ever made the speech to them which occupies v.\n354-391, B. III. It is a double impossibility; 1st, because a piracy from\nTindal’s Christianity as Old as the Creation: now a piracy à parte postis common enough; but a piracy à parte ante, and by three centuries,\nwould (according to our old English phrase[5]) drive a coach-and-six\nthrough any copyright act that man born of woman could frame. 2dly, it is\nquite contrary to the evidence on Joanna’s trial; for Southey’s “Joan” of\nA. Dom. 1796 (Cottle, Bristol), tells the doctors, amongst other secrets,\nthat she never in her life attended–1st, Mass; nor 2d, the Sacramental\ntable; nor 3d, Confession. Here’s a precious windfall for the doctors;\nthey, by snaky tortuosities, had hoped, through the aid of a corkscrew,\n(which every D. D. or S.T.P. is said to carry in his pocket,) for the\nhappiness of ultimately extracting from Joanna a few grains of heretical\npowder or small shot, which might have justified their singeing her a\nlittle. And just at such a crisis, expressly to justify their burning her\nto a cinder, up gallops Joanna with a brigade of guns, unlimbers, and\nserves them out with heretical grape and deistical round-shot enough to lay\na kingdom under interdict. Any miracles, to which Joanna might treat the\ngrim D. Ds. after that, would go to the wrong side of her little account\nin the clerical books. Joanna would be created a Dr. herself, but not of\nDivinity. For in the Joanna page of the ledger the entry would be–\"Miss\nJoanna, in acct. with the Church, Dr. by sundry diabolic miracles, she\nhaving publicly preached heresy, shown herself a witch, and even tried hard\nto corrupt the principles of six church pillars.” In the mean time, all\nthis deistical confession of Joanna’s, besides being suicidal for the\ninterest of her cause, is opposed to the depositions upon both trials.\nThe very best witness called from first to last deposes that Joanna\nattended these rites of her Church even too often; was taxed with doing so;\nand, by blushing, owned the charge as a fact, though certainly not as a\nfault. Joanna was a girl of natural piety, that saw God in forests,\nand hills, and fountains; but did not the less seek him in chapels and\nconsecrated oratories.",
        "This peasant girl was self-educated through her own natural meditativeness.\nIf the reader turns to that divine passage in Paradise Regained, which\nMilton has put into the mouth of our Saviour when first entering the\nwilderness, and musing upon the tendency of those great impulses growing\nwithin himself–",
        "  “Oh, what a multitude of thoughts arise!” &c.",
        "he will have some notion of the vast reveries which brooded over the heart\nof Joanna in early girlhood, when the wings were budding that should carry\nher from Orleans to Rheims; when the golden chariot was dimly revealing\nitself that should carry her from the kingdom of France Delivered to the\neternal kingdom.",
        "It is not requisite, for the honor of Joanna, nor is there, in this place,\nroom to pursue her brief career of action. That, though wonderful, forms\nthe earthly part of her story: the intellectual part is, the saintly\npassion of her imprisonment, trial, and execution. It is unfortunate,\ntherefore, for Southey’s “Joan of Arc,” (which however should always be\nregarded as a juvenile effort,) that, precisely when her real glory\nbegins, the poem ends. But this limitation of the interest grew, no doubt,\nfrom the constraint inseparably attached to the law of epic unity. Joanna’s\nhistory bisects into two opposite hemispheres, and both could not have been\npresented to the eye in one poem, unless by sacrificing all unity of theme,\nor else by involving the earlier half, as a narrative episode, in the\nlatter;–this might have been done–it might have been communicated to a\nfellow-prisoner, or a confessor, by Joanna herself, in the same way that\nVirgil has contrived to acquaint the reader, through the hero’s mouth, with\nearlier adventures that, if told by the poet speaking in his own person,\nwould have destroyed the unity of his fable. The romantic interest of the\nearly and irrelate incidents (last night of Troy, &c.) is thrown as an\naffluent into the general river of the personal narrative, whilst yet the\ncapital current of the epos, as unfolding ihe origin and incunabula of\nRome, is not for a moment suffered to be modified by events so subordinate\nand so obliquely introduced. It is sufficient, as concerns this section\nof Joanna’s life to say–that she fulfilled, to the height of her promises,\nthe restoration of the prostrate throne. France had become a province of\nEngland; and for the ruin of both, if such a yoke could be maintained.\nDreadful pecuniary exhaustion caused the English energy to droop; and\nthat critical opening La Pucelle used with a corresponding felicity\nof audacity and suddenness (that were in themselves portentous) for\nintroducing the wedge of French native resources, for rekindling the\nnational pride, and for planting the Dauphin once more upon his feet. When\nJoanna appeared, he had been on the point of giving up the struggle with\nthe English, distressed as they were, and of flying to the south of France.\nShe taught him to blush for such abject counsels. She liberated Orleans,\nthat great city, so decisive by its fate for the issue of the war, and then\nbeleaguered by the English with an elaborate application of engineering\nskill unprecedented in Europe. Entering the city after sunset, on the 29th\nof April, she sang mass on Sunday, May 8, for the entire disappearance of\nthe besieging force. On the 29th of June, she fought and gained over the\nEnglish the decisive battle of Patay; on the 9th of July, she took Troyes\nby a coup-de-main from a mixed garrison of English and Burgundians; on the\n15th of that month, she carried the Dauphin into Rheims; on Sunday the\n17th, she crowned him; and there she rested from her labor of triumph. What\nremained was–to suffer.",
        "All this forward movement was her own: excepting one man, the whole council\nwas against her. Her enemies were all that drew power from earth. Her\nsupporters were her own strong enthusiasm, and the headlong contagion\nby which she carried this sublime frenzy into the hearts of women, of\nsoldiers, and of all who lived by labor. Henceforwards she was thwarted;\nand the worst error, that she committed, was to lend the sanction of her\npresence to counsels which she disapproved. But she had accomplished the\ncapital objects which her own visions had dictated. These involved all the\nrest. Errors were now less important; and doubtless it had now become more\ndifficult for herself to pronounce authentically what were errors. The\nnoble girl had achieved, as by a rapture of motion, the capital end of\nclearing out a free space around her sovereign, giving him the power to\nmove his arms with effect; and, secondly, the inappreciable end of winning\nfor that sovereign what seemed to all France the heavenly ratification of\nhis rights, by crowning him with the ancient solemnities. She had made it\nimpossible for the English now to step before her. They were caught in an\nirretrievable blunder, owing partly to discord amongst the uncles of Henry\nVI., partly to a want of funds, but partly to the very impossibility which\nthey believed to press with tenfold force upon any French attempt to\nforestall theirs. They laughed at such a thought; and whilst they laughed,\nshe did it. Henceforth the single redress for the English of this capital\noversight, but which never could have redressed it effectually, was–to\nvitiate and taint the coronation of Charles VII. as the work of a witch.\nThat policy, and not malice, (as M. Michelet is so happy to believe,) was\nthe moving principle in the subsequent prosecution of Joanna. Unless\nthey unhinged the force of the first coronation in the popular mind, by\nassociating it with power given from hell, they felt that the sceptre of\nthe invader was broken.",
        "But she, the child that, at nineteen, had wrought wonders so great for\nFrance, was she not elated? Did she not lose, as men so often have lost,\nall sobriety of mind when standing upon the pinnaclè of successes so giddy?\nLet her enemies declare. During the progress of her movement, and in\nthe centre of ferocious struggles, she had manifested the temper of her\nfeelings by the pity which she had every where expressed for the suffering\nenemy. She forwarded to the English leaders a touching invitation to unite\nwith the French, as brothers, in a common crusade against infidels, thus\nopening the road for a soldierly retreat. She interposed to protect\nthe captive or the wounded–she mourned over the excesses of her\ncountrymen–she threw herself off her horse to kneel by the dying English\nsoldier, and to comfort him with such ministrations, physical or spiritual,\nas his situation allowed. “Nolebat,” says the evidence, “uti onso suo, aut\nquemquam interficere.” She sheltered the English, that invoked her aid, in\nher own quarters. She wept as she beheld, stretched on the field of battle,\nso many brave enemies that had died without confession. And, as regarded\nherself, her elation expressed itself thus:–on the day when she had\nfinished her work, she wept; for she knew that, when her task was done, her\nend must be approaching. Her aspirations pointed only to a place, which\nseemed to her more than usually full of natural piety, as one in which it\nwould give her pleasure to die. And she uttered, between smiles and tears,\nas a wish that inexpressibly fascinated her heart, and yet was half\nfantastic, a broken prayer that God would return her to the solitudes from\nwhich he had drawn her, and suffer her to become a shepherdess once more.\nIt was a natural prayer, because nature has laid a necessity upon every\nhuman heart to seek for rest, and to shrink from torment. Yet, again, it\nwas a half-fantastic prayer, because, from childhood upwards, visions that\nshe had no power to mistrust, and the voices which sounded in her ear for\never, had long since persuaded her mind, that for her no such prayer\ncould be granted. Too well she felt that her mission must be worked out to\nthe end, and that the end was now at hand. All went wrong from this time.\nShe herself had created the funds out of which the French restoration\nshould grow; but she was not suffered to witness their development, or\ntheir prosperous application. More than one military plan was entered upon\nwhich she did not approve. But she still continued to expose her person\nas before. Severe wounds had not taught her caution. And at length, in a\nsortie from Compeigne, whether through treacherous collusion on the part\nof her own friends is doubtful to this day, she was made prisoner by the\nBurgundians, and finally surrendered to the English.",
        "Now came her trial. This trial, moving of course under English influence,\nwas conducted in chief by the Bishop of Beauvais. He was a Frenchman, sold\nto English interests, and hoping, by favor of the English leaders, to\nreach the highest preferment. Bishop that art, Archbishop that shalt be,\nCardinal that mayest be, were the words that sounded continually in his\near; and doubtless, a whisper of visions still higher, of a triple crown,\nand feet upon the necks of kings, sometimes stole into his heart. M.\nMichelet is anxious to keep us in mind that this Bishop was but an agent\nof the English. True. But it does not better the case for his countryman;\nthat, being an accomplice in the crime, making himself the leader in the\npersecution against the helpless girl, he was willing to be all this in\nthe spirit, and with the conscious vileness of a catspaw. Never from the\nfoundations of the earth was there such a trial as this, if it were laid\nopen in all its beauty of defence, and all its hellishness of attack. Oh,\nchild of France! shepherdess, peasant girl! trodden under foot by all\naround thee, how I honor thy flashing intellect, quick as God’s lightning,\nand true as that lightning to its mark, that ran before France and laggard\nEurope by many a century, confounding the malice of the ensnarer, and\nmaking dumb the oracles of falsehood! Is it not scandalous, is it not\nhumiliating to civilization, that, even at this day, France exhibits the\nhorrid spectacle of judges examining the prisoner against himself; seducing\nhim, by fraud, into treacherous conclusions against his own head; using the\nterrors of their power for extorting confessions from the frailty of hope;\nnay, (which is worse,) using the blandishments of condescension and snaky\nkindness for thawing into compliances of gratitude those whom they had\nfailed to freeze into terror? Wicked judges! Barbarian jurisprudence! that,\nsitting in your own conceit on the summits of social wisdom, have yet\nfailed to learn the first principles of criminal justice; sit ye humbly and\nwith docility at the feet of this girl from Domrémy, that tore your webs of\ncruelty into shreds and dust, “Would you examine me as a witness against\nmyself?” was the question by which many times she defied their arts.\nContinually she showed that their interrogations were irrelevant to any\nbusiness before the court, or that entered into the ridiculous charges\nagainst her. General questions were proposed to her on points of\ncasuistical divinity; two-edged questions which not one of themselves could\nhave answered without, on the one side, landing himself in heresy (as\nthen interpreted), or, on the other, in some presumptuous expression of\nself-esteem. Next came a wretched Dominican that pressed her with an\nobjection, which, if applied to the Bible, would tax every one of its\nmiracles with unsoundness. The monk had the excuse of never having read the\nBible. M. Michelet has no such excuse; and it makes one blush for him, as a\nphilosopher, to find him describing such an argument as “weighty,” whereas\nit is but a varied expression of rude Mahometan metaphysics. Her answer\nto this, if there were room to place the whole in a clear light, was as\nshattering as it was rapid. Another thought to entrap her by asking what\nlanguage the angelic visitors of her solitude had talked: as though\nheavenly counsels could want polyglott interpreters for every word, or that\nGod needed language at all in whispering thoughts to a human heart. Then\ncame a worse devil, who asked her whether the archangel Michael had\nappeared naked. Not comprehending the vile insinuation, Joanna, whose\npoverty suggested to her simplicity that it might be the costliness or\nsuitable robes which caused the demur, asked them if they fancied God,\nwho clothed the flowers of the valleys, unable to find raiment for his\nservants. The answer of Joanna moves a smile of tenderness, but the\ndisappointment of her judges makes one laugh horribly. Others succeeded\nby troops, who upbraided her with leaving her father; as if that greater\nFather, whom she believed herself to have been serving, did not retain the\npower of dispensing with his own rules, or had not said, that, for a less\ncause than martyrdom, man and woman should leave both father and mother.",
        "On Easter Sunday, when the trial had been long proceeding, the poor girl\nfell so ill as to cause a belief that she had been poisoned. It was not\npoison. Nobody had any interest in hastening a death so certain. M.\nMichelet, whose sympathies with all feelings are so quick that one would\ngladly see them always as justly directed, reads the case most truly.\nJoanna had a two-fold malady. She was visited by a paroxysm of the\ncomplaint called home-sickness; the cruel nature of her imprisonment, and\nits length, could not but point her solitary thoughts, in darkness, and in\nchains, (for chained she was,) to Domrémy. And the season, which was the\nmost heavenly period of the spring, added stings to this yearning. That\nwas one of her maladies–nostalgia, as medicine calls it; the other was\nweariness and exhaustion from daily combats with malice. She saw that\neverybody hated her, and thirsted for her blood; nay, many kind-hearted\ncreatures that would have pitied her profoundly as regarded all political\ncharges, had their natural feelings warped by the belief that she had\ndealings with fiendish powers. She knew she was to die; that was not the\nmisery; the misery was that this consummation could not be reached without\nso much intermediate strife, as if she were contending for some chance\n(where chance was none) of happiness, or were dreaming for a moment of\nescaping the inevitable. Why, then, did she contend? Knowing that she\nwould reap nothing from answering her persecutors, why did she not retire\nby silence from the superfluous contest? It was because her quick and eager\nloyalty to truth would not suffer her to see it darkened by frauds, which\nshe could expose, but others, even of candid listeners, perhaps, could\nnot; it was through that imperishable grandeur of soul, which taught her\nto submit meekly and without a struggle to her punishment, but taught\nher not to submit–no, not for a moment–to calumny as to facts, or to\nmisconstruction as to motives. Besides, there were secretaries all around\nthe court taking down her words. That was meant for no good to her. But\nthe end does not always correspond to the meaning. And Joanna might say to\nherself–these words that will be used against me to-morrow and the next\nday, perhaps in some nobler generation may rise again for my justification.\nYes, Joanna, they are rising even now in Paris, and for more than\njustification.",
        "Woman, sister–there are some things which you do not execute as well as\nyour brother, man; no, nor ever will. Pardon me if I doubt whether you will\never produce a great poet from your choirs, or a Mozart, or a Phidias, or a\nMichael Angelo, or a great philosopher, or a great scholar. By which last\nis meant–not one who depends simply on an infinite memory, but also on an\ninfinite and electrical power of combination; bringing together from the\nfour winds, like the angel of the resurrection, what else were dust from\ndead men’s bones, into the unity of breathing life. If you can create\nyourselves into any of these great creators, why have you not? Do not ask\nme to say otherwise; because if you do, you will lead me into temptation.\nFor I swore early in life never to utter a falsehood, and, above all, a\nsycophantic falsehood; and, in the false homage of the modern press towards\nwomen, there is horrible sycophancy. It is as hollow, most of it, and it is\nas fleeting as is the love that lurks in uxoriousness. Yet, if a woman\nasks me to tell a faleshood, I have long made up my mind–that on moral\nconsiderations I will, and ought to do so, whether it be for any\npurpose of glory to her, or of screening her foibles (for she doescommit a few), or of humbly, as a vassal, paying a peppercorn rent to her\naugust privilege of caprice. Barring these cases, I must adhere to my\nresolution of telling no fibs. And I repeat, therefore, but not to be rude,\nI repeat in Latin–",
        "  Excudent alii meliús spirantia signa,\n  Credo equidem vivos ducent de marmore vultus:\n  Altius ascendent: at tu caput, Eva, memento\n  Sandalo ut infringas referenti oracula tanta.[6]",
        "Yet, sister woman–though I cannot consent to find a Mozart or a Michael\nAngelo in your sex, until that day when you claim my promise as to\nfalsehood–cheerfully, and with the love that burns in depths of\nadmiration, I acknowledge that you can do one thing as well as the best of\nus men–a greater thing than even Mozart is known to have done, or Michael\nAngelo–you can die grandly, and as goddesses would die were goddesses\nmortal. If any distant world (which may be the case) are so far ahead\nof us Tellurians in optical resources as to see distinctly through their\ntelescopes all that we do on earth, what is the grandest sight to which we\never treat them? St. Peter’s at Rome, do you fancy, on Easter Sunday, or\nLuxor, or perhaps the Himalayas? Pooh! pooh! my friend: suggest something\nbetter; these are baubles to them; they see in other worlds, in their\nown, far better toys of the same kind. These, take my word for it, are\nnothing. Do you give it up? The finest thing, then, we have to show them\nis a scaffold on the morning of execution. I assure you there is a strong\nmuster in those fair telescopic worlds, on any such morning, of those who\nhappen to find themselves occupying the right hemisphere for a peep\nat us. Telescopes look up in the market on that morning, and bear a\nmonstrous premium; for they cheat, probably, in those scientific worlds as\nwell as we do. How, then, if it be announced in some such telescopic world\nby those who make a livelihood of catching glimpses at our newspapers,\nwhose language they have long since deciphered, that the poor victim in the\nmorning’s sacrifice is a woman? How, if it be published on that distant\nworld that the sufferer wears upon her head, in the eyes of many, the\ngarlands of martyrdom? How, if it should be some Marie Antoinette, the\nwidowed queen, coming forward on the scaffold, and presenting to the\nmorning air her head, turned gray prematurely by sorrow, daughter of Cæsars\nkneeling down humbly to kiss the guillotine, as one that worships death?\nHow, if it were the “martyred wife of Roland,” uttering impassioned\ntruth–truth odious to the rulers of her country–with her expiring breath?\nHow, if it were the noble Charlotte Corday, that in the bloom of youth,\nthat with the loveliest of persons, that with homage waiting upon her\nsmiles wherever she turned her face to scatter them–homage that followed\nthose smiles as surely as the carols of birds, after showers in spring,\nfollow the re-appearing sun and the racing of sunbeams over the hills–yet\nthought all these things cheaper than the dust upon her sandals in\ncomparison of deliverance from hell for her dear suffering France? Ah!\nthese were spectacles indeed for those sympathizing people in distant\nworlds; and some, perhaps, would suffer a sort of martyrdom themselves,\nbecause they could not testify their wrath, could not bear witness to the\nstrength of love, and to the fury of hatred, that burned within them at\nsuch scenes; could not gather into golden urns some of that glorious dust\nwhich rested in the catacombs of earth.",
        "On the Wednesday after Trinity Sunday in 1431, being then about nineteen\nyears of age, the Maid of Arc underwent her martyrdom. She was conducted\nbefore mid-day, guarded by eight hundred spearmen, to a platform of\nprodigious height, constructed of wooden billets supported by occasional\nwalls of lath and plaster, and traversed by hollow spaces in every\ndirection for the creation of air-currents. The pile “struck terror,” says\nM. Michelet, “by its height;” and, as usual, the English purpose in this is\nviewed as one of pure malignity. But there are two ways of explaining all\nthat. It is probable that the purpose was merciful. On the circumstances of\nthe execution I shall not linger. Yet, to mark the almost fatal felicity\nof M. Michelet in finding out whatever may injure the English name, at\na moment when every reader will be interested in Joanna’s personal\nappearance, it is really edifying to notice the ingenuity by which he draws\ninto light from a dark corner a very unjust account of it, and neglects,\nthough lying upon the high road, a very pleasing one. Both are from English\npens. Grafton, a chronicler but little read, being a stiff-necked John\nBull, thought fit to say, that no wonder Joanna should be a virgin, since\nher “foule face” was a satisfactory solution of that particular merit.\nHolinshead, on the other hand, a chronicler somewhat later, every way more\nimportant, and universally read, has given a very pleasing testimony to the\ninteresting character of Joanna’s person and engaging manners. Neither\nof these men lived till the following century, so that personally this\nevidence is none at all. Grafton sullenly and carelessly believed as\nhe wished to believe; Holinshead took pains to inquire, and reports\nundoubtedly the general impression of France. But I cite the case as\nillustrating M. Michelet’s candor.[7]",
        "The circumstantial incidents of the execution, unless with more space\nthan I can now command, I should be unwilling to relate. I should fear\nto injure, by imperfect report, a martyrdom which to myself appears so\nunspeakably grand. Yet for a purpose pointing, not at Joanna but at M.\nMichelet,–viz., to convince him that an Englishman is capable of thinking\nmore highly of La Pucelle than even her admiring countryman, I shall, in\nparting, allude to one or two traits in Joanna’s demeanor on the scaffold,\nand to one or two in that of the bystanders, which authorize me in\nquestioning an opinion of his upon this martyr’s firmness. The reader ought\nto be reminded that Joanna d’Arc was subjected to an unusually unfair trial\nof opinion. Any of the elder Christian martyrs had not much to fear of\npersonal rancor. The martyr was chiefly regarded as the enemy of Cæsar;\nat times, also, where any knowledge of the Christian faith and morals\nexisted, with the enmity that arises spontaneously in the worldly against\nthe spiritual. But the martyr, though disloyal, was not supposed to be,\ntherefore, anti-national; and still less was individually hateful. What\nwas hated (if anything) belonged to his class, not to himself separately.\nNow Joanna, if hated at all, was hated personally, and in Rouen on national\ngrounds. Hence there would be a certainty of calumny arising against her,\nsuch as would not affect martyrs in general. That being the case, it would\nfollow of necessity that some people would impute to her a willingness to\nrecant. No innocence could escape that. Now, had she really testified\nthis willingness on the scaffold, it would have argued nothing at all but\nthe weakness of a genial nature shrinking from the instant approach of\ntorment. And those will often pity that weakness most, who, in their own\npersons, would yield to it least. Meantime, there never was a calumny\nuttered that drew less support from the recorded circumstances. It rests\nupon no positive testimony, and it has a weight of contradicting\ntestimony to stem. And yet, strange to say, M. Michelet, who at times seems\nto admire the Maid of Arc as much as I do, is the one sole writer amongst\nher friends who lends some countenance to this odious slander. His words\nare, that, if she did not utter this word recant with her lips, she\nuttered it in her heart. “Whether, she said the word is uncertain: but I\naffirm that she thought it.”",
        "Now, I affirm that she did not; not in any sense of the word ’thought\"\napplicable to the case. Here is France calumniating La Pucelle: here\nis England defending her. M. Michelet can only mean, that, on a prioriprinciples, every woman must be presumed liable to such a weakness; that\nJoanna was a woman; ergo, that she was liable to such a weakness. That\nis, he only supposes her to have uttered the word by an argument which\npresumes it impossible for anybody to have done otherwise. I, on the\ncontrary, throw the onus of the argument not on presumable tendencies of\nnature, but on the known facts of that morning’s execution, as recorded\nby multitudes. What else, I demand, than mere weight of metal, absolute\nnobility of deportment, broke the vast line of battle then arrayed against\nher? What else but her meek, saintly demeanor, won from the enemies, that\ntill now had believed her a witch, tears of rapturous admiration? “Ten\nthousand men,” says M. Michelet himself, “ten thousand men wept;” and of\nthese ten thousand the majority were political enemies knitted together by\ncords of superstition. What else was it but her constancy, united with her\nangelic gentleness, that drove the fanatic English soldier–who had sworn\nto throw a faggot on her scaffold, as his tribute of abhorrence, that\ndid so, that fulfilled his vow–suddenly to turn away a penitent for\nlife, saying everywhere that he had seen a dove rising upon wings to heaven\nfrom the ashes where she had stood? What else drove the executioner to\nkneel at every shrine for pardon to his share in the tragedy? And, if all\nthis were insufficient, then I cite the closing act of her life as valid\non her behalf, were all other testimonies against her. The executioner had\nbeen directed to apply his torch from below. He did so. The fiery smoke\nrose upwards in billowing volumes. A Dominican monk was then standing\nalmost at her side. Wrapt up in his sublime office, he saw not the danger,\nbut still persisted in his prayers. Even then, when the last enemy was\nracing up the fiery stairs to seize her, even at that moment did this\nnoblest of girls think only for him, the one friend that would not\nforsake her, and not for herself; bidding him with her last breath to care\nfor his own preservation, but to leave her to God. That girl, whose\nlatest breath ascended in this sublime expression of self-oblivion, did not\nutter the word recant either with her lips or in her heart. No; she did\nnot, though one should rise from the dead to swear it.",
        "Bishop of Beauvais! thy victim died in fire upon a scaffold–thou upon a\ndown bed. But for the departing minutes of life, both are oftentimes alike.\nAt the farewell crisis, when the gates of death are opening, and flesh is\nresting from its struggles, oftentimes the tortured and the torturer have\nthe same truce from carnal torment; both sink together into sleep; together\nboth, sometimes, kindle into dreams. When the mortal mists were gathering\nfast upon you two, Bishop and Shepherd girl–when the pavilions of life\nwere closing up their shadowy curtains about you–let us try, through the\ngigantic glooms, to decipher the flying features of your separate visions.",
        "The shepherd girl that had delivered France–she, from her dungeon, she,\nfrom her baiting at the stake, she, from her duel with fire, as she entered\nher last dream–saw Domrémy, saw the fountain of Domrémy, saw the pomp of\nforests in which her childhood had wandered. That Easter festival, which\nman had denied to her languishing heart–that resurrection of spring-time,\nwhich the darkness of dungeons had intercepted from her, hungering after\nthe glorious liberty of forests–were by God given back into her hands, as\njewels that had been stolen from her by robbers. With those, perhaps, (for\nthe minutes of dreams can stretch into ages,) was given back to her by God\nthe bliss of childhood. By special privilege, for her might be created,\nin this farewell dream, a second childhood, innocent as the first; but not,\nlike that, sad with the gloom of a fearful mission in the rear. This\nmission had now been fulfilled. The storm was weathered, the skirts even of\nthat mighty storm were drawing off. The blood, that she was to reckon for,\nhad been exacted; the tears, that she was to shed in secret, had been paid\nto the last. The hatred to herself in all eyes had been faced steadily, had\nbeen suffered, had been survived. And in her last fight upon the scaffold\nshe had triumphed gloriously; victoriously she had tasted the stings of\ndeath. For all, except this comfort from her farewell dream, she had\ndied–died, amidst the tears of ten thousand enemies–died, amidst the\ndrums and trumpets of armies–died, amidst peals redoubling upon peals,\nvolleys upon volleys, from the saluting clarions of martyrs.",
        "Bishop of Beauvais! because the guilt-burthened man is in dreams haunted\nand waylaid by the most frightful of his crimes, and because upon that\nfluctuating mirror–rising (like the mocking mirrors of mirage in Arabian\ndeserts) from the fens of death–most of all are reflected the sweet\ncountenances which the man has laid in ruins; therefore I know, Bishop,\nthat you, also, entering your final dream, saw Domrémy. That fountain,\nof which the witnesses spoke so much, showed itself to your eyes in pure\nmorning dews; but neither dews, nor the holy dawn, could cleanse away the\nbright spots of innocent blood upon its surface. By the fountain, Bishop,\nyou saw a woman seated, that hid her face. But as you draw near, the\nwoman raises her wasted features. Would Domrémy know them again for the\nfeatures of her child? Ah, but you know them, Bishop, well! Oh, mercy!\nwhat a groan was that which the servants, waiting outside the Bishop’s\ndream at his bedside, heard from his laboring heart, as at this moment he\nturned away from the fountain and the woman, seeking rest in the forests\nafar off. Yet not so to escape the woman, whom once again he must behold\nbefore he dies. In the forests to which he prays for pity, will he find a\nrespite? What a tumult, what a gathering of feet is there! In glades, where\nonly wild deer should run, armies and nations are assembling; towering in\nthe fluctuating crowd are phantoms that belong to departed hours. There is\nthe great English Prince, Regent of France. There is my Lord of Winchester,\nthe princely Cardinal, that died and made no sign. There is the Bishop of\nBeauvais, clinging to the shelter of thickets. What building is that which\nhands so rapid are raising? Is it a martyr’s scaffold? Will they burn the\nchild of Domrémy a second time? No: it is a tribunal that rises to the\nclouds; and two nations stand around it, waiting for a trial. Shall my Lord\nof Beauvais sit again upon the judgment-seat, and again number the hours\nfor the innocent? Ah! no: he is the prisoner at the bar. Already all is\nwaiting; the mighty audience is gathered, the Court is hurrying to their\nseats, the witnesses are arrayed, the trumpets are sounding, the judge\nis going to take his place. Oh! but this is sudden. My lord, have you\nno counsel? “Counsel I have none: in heaven above, or on earth beneath,\ncounsellor there is none now that would take a brief from me: all are\nsilent.” Is it, indeed, come to this? Alas! the time is short, the tumult\nis wondrous, the crowd stretches away into infinity, but yet I will search\nin it for somebody to take your brief: I know of somebody that will be your\ncounsel. Who is this that cometh from Domrémy? Who is she that cometh in\nbloody coronation robes from Rheims? Who is she that cometh with blackened\nflesh from walking the furnaces of Rouen? This is she, the shepherd girl,\ncounsellor that had none for herself, whom I choose, Bishop, for yours. She\nit is, I engage, that shall take my lord’s brief. She it is, Bishop, that\nwould plead for you: yes, Bishop, SHE–when heaven and earth are silent.",

        "Amongst the many ebullitions of M. Michelet’s fury against us poor English,\nare four which will be likely to amuse the reader; and they are the more\nconspicuous in collision with the justice which he sometimes does us, and\nthe very indignant admiration which, under some aspects, he grants to us.",
        "1. Our English literature he admires with some gnashing of teeth. He\npronounces it “fine and sombre,” but, I lament to add, “sceptical, Judaic,\nSatanic–in a word, Anti-Christian.” That Lord Byron should figure as a\nmember of this diabolical corporation, will not surprise men. It willsurprise them to hear that Milton is one of its Satanic leaders. Many are\nthe generous and eloquent Frenchmen, beside Chateaubriand, who have, in\nthe course of the last thirty years, nobly suspended their own burning\nnationality, in order to render a more rapturous homage at the feet of\nMilton; and some of them have raised Milton almost to a level with angelic\nnatures. Not one of them has thought of looking for him below the earth.\nAs to Shakspeare, M. Michelet detects in him a most extraordinary mare’s\nnest. It is this: he does “not recollect to have seen the name of God” in\nany part of his works. On reading such words, it is natural to rub one’s\neyes, and suspect that all one has ever seen in this world may have been\na pure ocular delusion. In particular, I begin myself to suspect that the\nword ’la gloire” never occurs in any Parisian journal. “The great English\nnation,” says M. Michelet, “has one immense profound vice,” to wit,\n\"pride.” Why, really, that may be true; but we have a neighbor not\nabsolutely clear of an “immense profound vice,” as like ours in color and\nshape as cherry to cherry. In short, M. Michelet thinks us, by fits and\nstarts, admirable, only that we are detestable; and he would adore some of\nour authors, were it not that so intensely he could have wished to kick\nthem.",
        "2. M. Michelet thinks to lodge an arrow in our sides by a very odd remark\nupon Thomas à Kempis: which is, that a man of any conceivable European\nblood–a Finlander, suppose, or a Zantiote–might have written Tom; only\nnot an Englishman. Whether an Englishman could have forged Tom, must remain\na matter of doubt, unless the thing had been tried long ago. That problem\nwas intercepted for ever by Tom’s perverseness in choosing to manufacture\nhimself. Yet, since nobody is better aware than M. Michelet, that this very\npoint of Kempis having manufactured Kempis is furiously and hopelessly\nlitigated, three or four nations claiming to have forged his work for him,\nthe shocking old doubt will raise its snaky head once more–whether this\nforger, who rests in so much darkness, might not, after all, be of English\nblood. Tom, it may be feared, is known to modern English literature chiefly\nby an irreverent mention of his name in a line of Peter Pindar’s (Dr.\nWolcot) fifty years back, where he is described as",
        "  “Kempis Tom,\n  Who clearly shows the way to Kingdom Come.”",
        "Few in these days can have read him, unless in the Methodist version of\nJohn Wesley. Amongst those few, however, happens to be myself; which arose\nfrom the accident of having, when a boy of eleven, received a copy of the\nDe Imitatione Christi, as a bequest from a relation, who died very young;\nfrom which cause, and from the external prettiness of the book, being a\nGlasgow reprint, by the celebrated Foulis, and gaily bound, I was induced\nto look into it; and finally read it many times over, partly out of\nsome sympathy which, even in those days, I had with its simplicity and\ndevotional fervor; but much more from the savage delight I found in\nlaughing at Tom’s Latinity. That, I freely grant to M. Michelet, is\ninimitable; else, as regards substance, it strikes me that I could forge a\nbetter De Imitatione myself. But there is no knowing till one tries. Yet,\nafter all, it is not certain whether the original was Latin. But, however\nthat may have been, if it is possible that M. Michelet[A] can be accurate\nin saying that there are no less than sixty French versions (not\neditions, observe, but separate versions) existing of the De Imitatione,\nhow prodigious must have been the adaptation of the book to the religious\nheart of the fifteenth century! Excepting the Bible, but excepting\nthat only in Protestant lands, no book known to man has had the same\ndistinction. It is the most marvellous bibliographical fact on record.",
        "[Footnote A: “If M. Michelet can be accurate.” However, on consideration,\nthis statement does not depend on Michelet. The bibliographer, Barbier,\nhas absolutely specified sixty in a separate dissertation, soixante\ntraductions, amongst those even that have not escaped the search. The\nItalian translations are said to be thirty. As to mere editions, not\ncounting the early MSS. for half a century before printing was introduced,\nthose in Latin amount to two thousand, and those in French to one thousand.\nMeantime, it is very clear to me that this astonishing popularity, so\nentirely unparalleled in literature, could not have existed except in Roman\nCatholic times, nor subsequently have lingered in any Protestant land. It\nwas the denial of Scripture fountains to thirsty lands which made this\nslender rill of Scripture truth so passionately welcome.]",
        "3. Our English girls, it seems, are as faulty in one way as we English\nmales in another. None of us lads could have written the Opera Omnia of\nMr. à Kempis; neither could any of our lasses have assumed male attire like\nLa Pucelle. But why? Because, says Michelet, English girls and German\nthink so much of an indecorum. Well, that is a good fault, generally\nspeaking. But M. Michelet ought to have remembered a fact in the\nmartyrologies which justifies both parties,–the French heroine for doing,\nand the general choir of English girls for not doing. A female saint,\nspecially renowned in France, had, for a reason as weighty as Joanna’s,\nviz., expressly to shield her modesty amongst men, wore a male military\nharness. That reason and that example authorized La Pucelle; but our\nEnglish girls, as a body, have seldom any such reason, and certainly no\nsuch saintly example, to plead. This excuses them. Yet, still, if it is\nindispensable to the national character that our young women should now and\nthen trespass over the frontier of decorum, it then becomes a patriotic\nduty in me to assure M. Michelet that we have such ardent females amongst\nus, and in a long series–some detected in naval hospitals, when too sick\nto remember their disguise; some on fields of battle; multitudes never\ndetected at all; some only suspected; and others discharged without noise\nby war offices and other absurd people. In our navy, both royal and\ncommercial, and generally from deep remembrances of slighted love, women\nhave sometimes served in disguise for many years, taking contentedly their\ndaily allowance of burgoo, biscuit, or cannon balls–anything, in short,\ndigestible or indigestible, that it might please Providence to send. One\nthing, at least, is to their credit: never any of these poor masks, with\ntheir deep silent remembrances, have been detected through murmuring, or\nwhat is nautically understood by “skulking.” So, for once, M. Michelet has\nan erratum to enter upon the fly-leaf of his book in presentation copies.",
        "4. But the last of these ebullitions is the most lively. We English, at\nOrleans, and after Orleans (which is not quite so extraordinary, if all\nwere told,) fled before the Maid of Arc. Yes, says M. Michelet, you did:\ndeny it, if you can. Deny it, my dear? I don’t mean to deny it. Running\naway, in many cases, is a thing so excellent, that no philosopher would,\nat times, condescend to adopt any other step. All of us nations in Europe,\nwithout one exception, have shown our philosophy in that way at times. Even\npeople, ’qui ne se rendent pas,” have deigned both to run and to shout,\n\"Sauve qui pent” at odd times of sunset; though, for my part, I have\nno pleasure in recalling unpleasant remembrances to brave men; and yet,\nreally, being so philosophic, they ought not to be unpleasant. But\nthe amusing feature in M. Michelet’s reproach, is the way in which he\nimproves and varies against us the charge of running, as if he were\nsinging a catch. Listen to him. They ’showed their backs,” did these\nEnglish. (Hip, hip, hurrah! three times three!) ’Behind good walls, they\nlet themselves be taken,” (Hip, hip! nine times nine!) They ’ran as\nfast as their legs could carry them.” (Hurrah! twenty-seven times\ntwenty-seven!) They ’ran before a girl;” they did. (Hurrah! eighty-one\ntimes eighty-one!) This reminds one of criminal indictments on the old\nmodel in English courts, where (for fear the prisoner should escape) the\ncrown lawyer varied the charge perhaps through forty counts. The law laid\nits guns so as to rake the accused at every possible angle. Whilst the\nindictment was reading, he seemed a monster of crime in his own eyes; and\nyet, after all, the poor fellow had but committed one offence, and not\nalways that. N.B.–Not having the French original at hand, I make my\nquotations from a friend’s copy of Mr. Walter Kelly’s translation, which\nseems to me faithful, spirited, and idiomatically English–liable, in fact,\nonly to the single reproach of occasional provincialisms.",
        "OR,",
        "THE GLORY OF MOTION.",
        "Some twenty or more years before I matriculated at Oxford, Mr. Palmer,\nM.P. for Bath, had accomplished two things, very hard to do on our little\nplanet, the Earth, however cheap they may happen to be held by the\neccentric people in comets: he had invented mail-coaches, and he had\nmarried the daughter[1] of a duke. He was, therefore, just twice as great a\nman as Galileo, who certainly invented (or discovered) the satellites of\nJupiter, those very next things extant to mail-coaches in the two capital\npoints of speed and keeping time, but who did not marry the daughter of a\nduke.",
        "These mail-coaches, as organized by Mr. Palmer, are entitled to a\ncircumstantial notice from myself–having had so large a share in\ndeveloping the anarchies of my subsequent dreams, an agency which they\naccomplished, first, through velocity, at that time unprecedented; they\nfirst revealed the glory of motion: suggesting, at the same time, an\nunder-sense, not unpleasurable, of possible though indefinite danger;\nsecondly, through grand effects for the eye between lamp-light and the\ndarkness upon solitary roads; thirdly, through animal beauty and power so\noften displayed in the class of horses selected for this mail service;\nfourthly, through the conscious presence of a central intellect, that, in\nthe midst of vast distances,[2] of storms, of darkness, of night, overruled\nall obstacles into one steady coöperation in a national result. To my own\nfeeling, this post-office service recalled some mighty orchestra, where a\nthousand instruments, all disregarding each other, and so far in danger of\ndiscord, yet all obedient as slaves to the supreme baton of some great\nleader, terminate in a perfection of harmony like that of heart, veins, and\narteries, in a healthy animal organization. But, finally, that particular\nelement in this whole combination which most impressed myself, and through\nwhich it is that to this hour Mr. Palmer’s mail-coach system tyrannizes\nby terror and terrific beauty over my dreams, lay in the awful political\nmission which at that time it fulfilled. The mail-coaches it was that\ndistributed over the face of the land, like the opening of apocalyptic\nvials, the heart-shaking news of Trafalgar, of Salamanca, of Vittoria, of\nWaterloo. These were the harvests that, in the grandeur of their reaping,\nredeemed the tears and blood in which they had been sown. Neither was the\nmeanest peasant so much below the grandeur and the sorrow of the times as\nto confound these battles, which were gradually moulding the destinies\nof Christendom, with the vulgar conflicts of ordinary warfare, which are\noftentimes but gladiatorial trials of national prowess. The victories of\nEngland in this stupendous contest rose of themselves as natural Te Deumsto heaven; and it was felt by the thoughtful that such victories, at such a\ncrisis of general prostration, were not more beneficial to ourselves than\nfinally to France, and to the nations of western and central Europe,\nthrough whose pusillanimity it was that the French domination had\nprospered.",
        "The mail-coach, as the national organ for publishing these mighty events,\nbecame itself a spiritualized and glorified object to an impassioned heart;\nand naturally, in the Oxford of that day, all hearts were awakened. There\nwere, perhaps, of us gownsmen, two thousand resident[3] in Oxford, and\ndispersed through five-and-twenty colleges. In some of these the custom\npermitted the student to keep what are called “short terms;” that is, the\nfour terms of Michaelmas, Lent, Easter, and Act, were kept severally by a\nresidence, in the aggregate, of ninety-one days, or thirteen weeks. Under\nthis interrupted residence, accordingly, it was possible that a student\nmight have a reason for going down to his home four times in the year. This\nmade eight journeys to and fro. And as these homes lay dispersed through\nall the shires of the island, and most of us disdained all coaches except\nhis majesty’s mail, no city out of London could pretend to so extensive a\nconnection with Mr. Palmer’s establishment as Oxford. Naturally, therefore,\nit became a point of some interest with us, whose journeys revolved every\nsix weeks on an average, to look a little into the executive details of\nthe system. With some of these Mr. Palmer had no concern; they rested upon\nbye-laws not unreasonable, enacted by posting-houses for their own benefit,\nand upon others equally stern, enacted by the inside passengers for the\nillustration of their own exclusiveness. These last were of a nature to\nrouse our scorn, from which the transition was not very long to mutiny.\nUp to this time, it had been the fixed assumption of the four inside\npeople, (as an old tradition of all public carriages from the reign\nof Charles II.,) that they, the illustrious quaternion, constituted\na porcelain variety of the human race, whose dignity would have been\ncompromised by exchanging one word of civility with the three miserable\ndelf ware outsides. Even to have kicked an outsider might have been held to\nattaint the foot concerned in that operation; so that, perhaps, it would\nhave required an act of parliament to restore its purity of blood. What\nwords, then, could express the horror, and the sense of treason, in that\ncase, which had happened, where all three outsides, the trinity of\nPariahs, made a vain attempt to sit down at the same breakfast table or\ndinner table with the consecrated four? I myself witnessed such an attempt;\nand on that occasion a benevolent old gentleman endeavored to soothe his\nthree holy associates, by suggesting that, if the outsides were indicted\nfor this criminal attempt at the next assizes, the court would regard it as\na case of lunacy (or delirium tremens) rather than of treason. England\nowes much of her grandeur to the depth of the aristocratic element in her\nsocial composition. I am not the man to laugh at it. But sometimes\nit expressed itself in extravagant shapes. The course taken with the\ninfatuated outsiders, in the particular attempt which I have noticed, was,\nthat the waiter, beckoning them away from the privileged salle-à-manger,\nsang out, “This way, my good men;” and then enticed them away off to the\nkitchen. But that plan had not always answered. Sometimes, though very\nrarely, cases occurred where the intruders, being stronger than usual, or\nmore vicious than usual, resolutely refused to move, and so far carried\ntheir point, as to have a separate table arranged for themselves in a\ncorner of the room. Yet, if an Indian screen could be found ample enough\nto plant them out from the very eyes of the high table, or dais, it then\nbecame possible to assume as a fiction of law–that the three delf fellows,\nafter all, were not present. They could be ignored by the porcelain men,\nunder the maxim, that objects not appearing, and not existing, are governed\nby the same logical construction.",
        "Such now being, at that time, the usages of mail-coaches, what was to be\ndone by us of young Oxford? We, the most aristocratic of people, who were\naddicted to the practice of looking down superciliously even upon the\ninsides themselves as often very suspicious characters, were we voluntarily\nto court indignities? If our dress and bearing sheltered us, generally,\nfrom the suspicion of being “raff,” (the name at that period for\n\"snobs,\"[4]) we really were such constructively, by the place we assumed.\nIf we did not submit to the deep shadow of eclipse, we entered at least the\nskirts of its penumbra. And the analogy of theatres was urged against us,\nwhere no man can complain of the annoyances incident to the pit or gallery,\nhaving his instant remedy in paying the higher price of the boxes. But\nthe soundness of this analogy we disputed. In the case of the theatre,\nit cannot be pretended that the inferior situations have any separate\nattractions, unless the pit suits the purpose of the dramatic reporter. But\nthe reporter or critic is a rarity. For most people, the sole benefit is in\nthe price. Whereas, on the contrary, the outside of the mail had its own\nincommunicable advantages. These we could not forego. The higher price we\nshould willingly have paid, but that was connected with the condition of\nriding inside, which was insufferable. The air, the freedom of prospect,\nthe proximity to the horses, the elevation of seat–these were what we\ndesired; but, above all, the certain anticipation of purchasing occasional\nopportunities of driving.",
        "Under coercion of this great practical difficulty, we instituted a\nsearching inquiry into the true quality and valuation of the different\napartments about the mail. We conducted this inquiry on metaphysical\nprinciples; and it was ascertained satisfactorily, that the roof of the\ncoach, which some had affected to call the attics, and some the garrets,\nwas really the drawing-room, and the box was the chief ottoman or sofa\nin that drawing-room; whilst it appeared that the inside, which had been\ntraditionally regarded as the only room tenantable by gentlemen, was, in\nfact, the coal-cellar in disguise.",
        "Great wits jump. The very same idea had not long before struck the\ncelestial intellect of China. Amongst the presents carried out by our first\nembassy to that country was a state-coach. It had been specially selected\nas a personal gift by George III.; but the exact mode of using it was a\nmystery to Pekin. The ambassador, indeed, (Lord Macartney,) had made some\ndim and imperfect explanations upon the point; but as his excellency\ncommunicated these in a diplomatic whisper, at the very moment of his\ndeparture, the celestial mind was very feebly illuminated; and it became\nnecessary to call a cabinet council on the grand state question–\"Where was\nthe emperor to sit?” The hammer-cloth happened to be unusually gorgeous;\nand partly on that consideration, but partly also because the box offered\nthe most elevated seat, and undeniably went foremost, it was resolved by\nacclamation that the box was the imperial place, and, for the scoundrel\nwho drove, he might sit where he could find a perch. The horses,\ntherefore, being harnessed, under a flourish of music and a salute of guns,\nsolemnly his imperial majesty ascended his new English throne, having the\nfirst lord of the treasury on his right hand, and the chief jester on his\nleft. Pekin gloried in the spectacle; and in the whole flowery people,\nconstructively present by representation, there was but one discontented\nperson, which was the coachman. This mutinous individual, looking as\nblackhearted as he really was, audaciously shouted, “Where am I to sit?\"\nBut the privy council, incensed by his disloyalty, unanimously opened the\ndoor, and kicked him into the inside. He had all the inside places\nto himself; but such is the rapacity of ambition, that he was still\ndissatisfied. “I say,” he cried out in an extempore petition, addressed to\nthe emperor through the window, “how am I to catch hold of the reins?” “Any\nhow,” was the answer; “don’t trouble me, man, in my glory; through the\nwindows, through the key-holes–how you please.” Finally this contumacious\ncoachman lengthened the checkstrings into a sort of jury-reins,\ncommunicating with the horses; with these he drove as steadily as may be\nsupposed. The emperor returned after the briefest of circuits; he descended\nin great pomp from his throne, with the severest resolution never to\nremount it. A public thanksgiving was ordered for his majesty’s prosperous\nescape from the disease of a broken neck; and the state-coach was dedicated\nfor ever as a votive offering to the god Fo, Fo–whom the learned more\naccurately called Fi, Fi.",
        "A revolution of this same Chinese character did young Oxford of that era\neffect in the constitution of mail-coach society. It was a perfect French\nrevolution; and we had good reason to say, Ca ira. In fact, it soon\nbecame too popular. The “public,” a well known character, particularly\ndisagreeable, though slightly respectable, and notorious for affecting the\nchief seats in synagogues, had at first loudly opposed this revolution;\nbut when the opposition showed itself to be ineffectual, our disagreeable\nfriend went into it with headlong zeal. At first it was a sort of race\nbetween us; and, as the public is usually above thirty, (say generally from\nthirty to fifty years old,) naturally we of young Oxford, that averaged\nabout twenty, had the advantage. Then the public took to bribing, giving\nfees to horse-keepers, &c., who hired out their persons as warming-pans on\nthe box-seat. That, you know, was shocking to our moral sensibilities.\nCome to bribery, we observed, and there is an end to all morality,\nAristotle’s, Cicero’s, or anybody’s. And, besides, of what use was it?\nFor we bribed also. And as our bribes to those of the public being\ndemonstrated out of Euclid to be as five shillings to sixpence, here\nagain young Oxford had the advantage. But the contest was ruinous to\nthe principles of the stable establishment about the mails. The whole\ncorporation was constantly bribed, rebribed, and often sur-rebribed; so\nthat a horse-keeper, ostler, or helper, was held by the philosophical at\nthat time to be the most corrupt character in the nation.",
        "There was an impression upon the public mind, natural enough from the\ncontinually augmenting velocity of the mail, but quite erroneous, that\nan outside seat on this class of carriages was a post of danger. On the\ncontrary, I maintained that, if a man had become nervous from some\ngipsey prediction in his childhood, allocating to a particular moon now\napproaching some unknown danger, and he should inquire earnestly, “Whither\ncan I go for shelter? Is a prison the safest retreat? Or a lunatic\nhospital? Or the British Museum?” I should have replied, “Oh, no; I’ll tell\nyou what to do. Take lodgings for the next forty days on the box of his\nmajesty’s mail. Nobody can touch you there. If it is by bills at ninety\ndays after date that you are made unhappy–if noters and protesters are the\nsort of wretches whose astrological shadows darken the house of life–then\nnote you what I vehemently protest, viz., that no matter though the sheriff\nin every county should be running after you with his posse, touch a hair\nof your head he cannot whilst you keep house, and have your legal domicile\non the box of the mail. It’s felony to stop the mail; even the sheriff\ncannot do that. And an extra (no great matter if it grazes the sheriff)\ntouch of the whip to the leaders at any time guarantees your safety.” In\nfact, a bed-room in a quiet house, seems a safe enough retreat; yet it is\nliable to its own notorious nuisances, to robbers by night, to rats, to\nfire. But the mail laughs at these terrors. To robbers, the answer is\npacked up and ready for delivery in the barrel of the guard’s blunderbuss.\nRats again! there are none about mail-coaches, any more than snakes in\nVan Troil’s Iceland; except, indeed, now and then a parliamentary rat, who\nalways hides his shame in the “coal cellar.” And, as to fire, I never knew\nbut one in a mail-coach, which was in the Exeter mail, and caused by an\nobstinate sailor bound to Devonport. Jack, making light of the law and the\nlawgiver that had set their faces against his offence, insisted on taking\nup a forbidden seat in the rear of the roof, from which he could exchange\nhis own yarns with those of the guard. No greater offence was then known to\nmail-coaches; it was treason, it was læsa majestas, it was by tendency\narson; and the ashes of Jack’s pipe, falling amongst the straw of the\nhinder boot, containing the mail-bags, raised a flame which (aided by the\nwind of our motion) threatened a revolution in the republic of letters. But\neven this left the sanctity of the box unviolated. In dignified repose,\nthe coachman and myself sat on, resting with benign composure upon our\nknowledge–that the fire would have to burn its way through four inside\npassengers before it could reach ourselves. With a quotation rather too\ntrite, I remarked to the coachman,–",
        "  ––\"Jam proximus ardet\n  Ucalegon.”",
        "But recollecting that the Virgilian part of his education might have been\nneglected, I interpreted so far as to say, that perhaps at that moment the\nflames were catching hold of our worthy brother and next-door neighbor\nUcalegon. The coachman said nothing, but, by his faint sceptical smile, he\nseemed to be thinking that he knew better; for that in fact, Ucalegon, as\nit happened, was not in the way-bill.",
        "No dignity is perfect which does not at some point ally itself with the\nindeterminate and mysterious. The connection of the mail with the state\nand the executive government–a connection obvious, but yet not strictly\ndefined–gave to the whole mail establishment a grandeur and an official\nauthority which did us service on the roads, and invested us with\nseasonable terrors. But perhaps these terrors were not the less impressive,\nbecause their exact legal limits were imperfectly ascertained. Look at\nthose turnpike gates; with what deferential hurry, with what an obedient\nstart, they fly open at our approach! Look at that long line of carts\nand carters ahead, audaciously usurping the very crest of the road. Ah!\ntraitors, they do not hear us as yet; but as soon as the dreadful blast of\nour horn reaches them with the proclamation of our approach, see with what\nfrenzy of trepidation they fly to their horses’ heads, and deprecate our\nwrath by the precipitation of their crane-neck quarterings. Treason they\nfeel to be their crime; each individual carter feels himself under the\nban of confiscation and attainder: his blood is attainted through six\ngenerations, and nothing is wanting but the headsman and his axe, the block\nand the sawdust, to close up the vista of his horrors. What! shall it be\nwithin benefit of clergy to delay the king’s message on the high\nroad?–to interrupt the great respirations, ebb or flood, of the national\nintercourse–to endanger the safety of tidings, running day and night\nbetween all nations and languages? Or can it be fancied, amongst the\nweakest of men, that the bodies of the criminals will be given up to their\nwidows for Christian burial? Now the doubts which were raised as to our\npowers did more to wrap them in terror, by wrapping them in uncertainty,\nthan could have been effected by the sharpest definitions of the law from\nthe Quarter Sessions. We, on our parts, (we, the collective mail, I mean,)\ndid our utmost to exalt the idea of our privileges by the insolence with\nwhich we wielded them. Whether this insolence rested upon law that gave\nit a sanction, or upon conscious power, haughtily dispensing with that\nsanction, equally it spoke from a potential station; and the agent in each\nparticular insolence of the moment, was viewed reverentially, as one having\nauthority.",
        "Sometimes after breakfast his majesty’s mail would become frisky: and in\nits difficult wheelings amongst the intricacies of early markets, it would\nupset an apple cart, a cart loaded with eggs, &c. Huge was the affliction\nand dismay, awful was the smash, though, after all, I believe the damage\nmight be levied upon the hundred. I, as far as possible, endeavored in such\na case to represent the conscience and moral sensibilities of the mail;\nand, when wildernesses of eggs were lying poached under our horses’ hoofs,\nthen would I stretch forth my hands in sorrow, saying (in words too\ncelebrated in those days from the false[5] echoes of Marengo)–\"Ah!\nwherefore have we not time to weep over you?” which was quite impossible,\nfor in fact we had not even time to laugh over them. Tied to post-office\ntime, with an allowance in some cases of fifty minutes for eleven miles,\ncould the royal mail pretend to undertake the offices of sympathy and\ncondolence? Could it be expected to provide tears for the accidents of the\nroad? If even it seemed to trample on humanity, it did so, I contended, in\ndischarge of its own more peremptory duties.",
        "Upholding the morality of the mail, à fortiori I upheld its rights,\nI stretched to the uttermost its privilege of imperial precedency, and\nastonished weak minds by the feudal powers which I hinted to be lurking\nconstructively in the charters of this proud establishment. Once I remember\nbeing on the box of the Holyhead mail, between Shrewsbury and Oswestry,\nwhen a tawdry thing from Birmingham, some Tallyho or Highflier, all\nflaunting with green and gold, came up alongside of us. What a contrast to\nour royal simplicity of form and color is this plebeian wretch! The single\nornament on our dark ground of chocolate color was the mighty shield of the\nimperial arms, but emblazoned in proportions as modest as a signet-ring\nbears to a seal of office. Even this was displayed only on a single panel,\nwhispering, rather than proclaiming, our relations to the state; whilst the\nbeast from Birmingham had as much writing and painting on its sprawling\nflanks as would have puzzled a decipherer from the tombs of Luxor. For some\ntime this Birmingham machine ran along by our side–a piece of familiarity\nthat seemed to us sufficiently jacobinical. But all at once a movement of\nthe horses announced a desperate intention of leaving us behind. “Do you\nsee that?” I said to the coachman. “I see,” was his short answer. He was\nawake, yet he waited longer than seemed prudent; for the horses of our\naudacious opponent had a disagreeable air of freshness and power. But\nhis motive was loyal; his wish was that the Birmingham conceit should be\nfull-blown before he froze it. When that seemed ripe, he unloosed, or, to\nspeak by a stronger image, he sprang his known resources, he slipped our\nroyal horses like cheetas, or hunting leopards, after the affrighted game.\nHow they could retain such a reserve of fiery power after the work they had\naccomplished, seemed hard to explain. But on our side, besides the physical\nsuperiority, was a tower of strength, namely, the king’s name, “which they\nupon the adverse faction wanted.” Passing them without an effort, as it\nseemed, we threw them into the rear with so lengthening an interval between\nus, as proved in itself the bitterest mockery of their presumption; whilst\nour guard blew back a shattering blast of triumph, that was really too\npainfully full of derision.",
        "I mention this little incident for its connection with what followed. A\nWelshman, sitting behind me, asked if I had not felt my heart burn within\nme during the continuance of the race? I said–No; because we were not\nracing with a mail, so that no glory could be gained. In fact, it was\nsufficiently mortifying that such a Birmingham thing should dare to\nchallenge us. The Welshman replied, that he didn’t see that; for that a\ncat might look at a king, and a Brummagem coach might lawfully race the\nHolyhead mail. ’Race us perhaps,” I replied, “though even that has an\nair of sedition, but not beat us. This would have been treason; and for\nits own sake I am glad that the Tallyho was disappointed.” So dissatisfied\ndid the Welshman seem with this opinion, that at last I was obliged to tell\nhim a very fine story from one of our elder dramatists, viz.–that once, in\nsome oriental region, when the prince of all the land, with his splendid\ncourt, were flying their falcons, a hawk suddenly flew at a majestic eagle;\nand in defiance of the eagle’s prodigious advantages, in sight also of all\nthe astonished field sportsmen, spectators, and followers, killed him on\nthe spot. The prince was struck with amazement at the unequal contest, and\nwith burning admiration for its unparalleled result. He commanded that the\nhawk should be brought before him; caressed the bird with enthusiasm, and\nordered that, for the commemoration of his matchless courage, a crown\nof gold should be solemnly placed on the hawk’s head; but then that,\nimmediately after this coronation, the bird should be led off to execution,\nas the most valiant indeed of traitors, but not the less a traitor that had\ndared to rise in rebellion against his liege lord the eagle. “Now,” said I\nto the Welshman, “How painful it would have been to you and me as men of\nrefined feelings, that this poor brute, the Tallyho, in the impossible case\nof a victory over us, should have been crowned with jewellery, gold, with\nBirmingham ware, or paste diamonds, and then led off to instant execution.\"\nThe Welshman doubted if that could be warranted by law. And when I hinted\nat the 10th of Edward III., chap. 15, for regulating the precedency of\ncoaches, as being probably the statute relied on for the capital punishment\nof such offences, he replied drily–that if the attempt to pass a mail was\nreally treasonable, it was a pity that the Tallyho appeared to have so\nimperfect an acquaintance with law.",
        "These were among the gaieties of my earliest and boyish acquaintance with\nmails. But alike the gayest and the most terrific of my experiences rose\nagain after years of slumber, armed with preternatural power to shake my\ndreaming sensibilities; sometimes, as in the slight case of Miss Fanny on\nthe Bath road, (which I will immediately mention,) through some casual or\ncapricious association with images originally gay, yet opening at some\nstage of evolution into sudden capacities of horror; sometimes through the\nmore natural and fixed alliances with the sense of power so various lodged\nin the mail system.",
        "The modern modes of travelling cannot compare with the mail-coach system\nin grandeur and power. They boast of more velocity, but not however as\na consciousness, but as a fact of our lifeless knowledge, resting upon\nalien evidence; as, for instance, because somebody says that we have\ngone fifty miles in the hour, or upon the evidence of a result, as that\nactually we find ourselves in York four hours after leaving London. Apart\nfrom such an assertion, or such a result, I am little aware of the pace.\nBut, seated on the old mail-coach, we needed no evidence out of ourselves\nto indicate the velocity. On this system the word was–Non magna\nloquimur, as upon railways, but magna vivimus. The vital experience of\nthe glad animal sensibilities made doubts impossible on the question of our\nspeed; we heard our speed, we saw it, we felt it as a thrilling; and this\nspeed was not the product of blind insensate agencies, that had no sympathy\nto give, but was incarnated in the fiery eyeballs of an animal, in his\ndilated nostril, spasmodic muscles, and echoing hoofs. This speed was\nincarnated in the visible contagion amongst brutes of some impulse, that,\nradiating into their natures, had yet its centre and beginning in man.\nThe sensibility of the horse, uttering itself in the maniac light of his\neye, might be the last vibration of such a movement; the glory of Salamanca\nmight be the first–but the intervening link that connected them, that\nspread the earthquake of the battle into the eyeball of the horse, was\nthe heart of man–kindling in the rapture of the fiery strife, and then\npropagating its own tumults by motions and gestures to the sympathies, more\nor less dim, in his servant the horse.",
        "But now, on the new system of travelling, iron tubes and boilers have\ndisconnected man’s heart from the ministers of his locomotion. Nile nor\nTrafalgar has power any more to raise an extra bubble in a steam-kettle.\nThe galvanic cycle is broken up for ever: man’s imperial nature no longer\nsends itself forward through the electric sensibility of the horse; the\ninter-agencies are gone in the mode of communication between the horse and\nhis master, out of which grew so many aspects of sublimity under accidents\nof mists that hid, or sudden blazes that revealed, of mobs that agitated,\nor midnight solitudes that awed. Tidings, fitted to convulse all nations,\nmust henceforwards travel by culinary process; and the trumpet that once\nannounced from afar the laurelled mail, heart-shaking, when heard screaming\non the wind, and advancing through the darkness to every village\nor solitary house on its route, has now given way for ever to the\npot-wallopings of the boiler.",
        "Thus have perished multiform openings for sublime effects, for interesting\npersonal communications, for revelations of impressive faces that could not\nhave offered themselves amongst the hurried and fluctuating groups of\na railway station. The gatherings of gazers about a mail-coach had one\ncentre, and acknowledged only one interest. But the crowds attending at\na railway station have as little unity as running water, and own as many\ncentres as there are separate carriages in the train.",
        "How else, for example, than as a constant watcher for the dawn, and for\nthe London mail that in summer months entered about dawn into the lawny\nthickets of Marlborough Forest, couldst thou, sweet Fanny of the Bath road,\nhave become known to myself? Yet Fanny, as the loveliest young woman for\nface and person that perhaps in my whole life I have beheld, merited\nthe station which even her I could not willingly have spared; yet\n(thirty-five years later) she holds in my dreams: and though, by an\naccident of fanciful caprice, she brought along with her into those dreams\na troop of dreadful creatures, fabulous and not fabulous, that were more\nabominable to a human heart than Fanny and the dawn were delightful.",
        "Miss Fanny of the Bath road, strictly speaking, lived at a mile’s distance\nfrom that road, but came so continually to meet the mail, that I on my\nfrequent transits rarely missed her, and naturally connected her name\nwith the great thoroughfare where I saw her; I do not exactly know, but I\nbelieve with some burthen of commissions to be executed in Bath, her own\nresidence being probably the centre to which these commissions gathered.\nThe mail coachman, who wore the royal livery, being one amongst the\nprivileged few,[6] happened to be Fanny’s grandfather. A good man he\nwas, that loved his beautiful granddaughter; and, loving her wisely, was\nvigilant over her deportment in any case where young Oxford might happen\nto be concerned. Was I then vain enough to imagine that I myself,\nindividually, could fall within the line of his terrors? Certainly not,\nas regarded any physical pretensions that I could plead; for Fanny (as a\nchance passenger from her own neighborhood once told me) counted in her\ntrain a hundred and ninety-nine professed admirers, if not open aspirants\nto her favor; and probably not one of the whole brigade but excelled myself\nin personal advantages. Ulysses even, with the unfair advantage of his\naccursed bow, could hardly have undertaken that amount of suitors. So\nthe danger might have seemed slight–only that woman is universally\naristocratic; it is amongst her nobilities of heart that she is so. Now,\nthe aristocratic distinctions in my favor might easily with Miss Fanny have\ncompensated my physical deficiencies. Did I then make love to Fanny? Why,\nyes; mais oui donc; as much love as one can make whilst the mail is\nchanging horses, a process which ten years later did not occupy above\neighty seconds; but then, viz., about Waterloo, it occupied five times\neighty. Now, four hundred seconds offer a field quite ample enough for\nwhispering into a young woman’s ear a great deal of truth; and (by way of\nparenthesis) some trifle of falsehood. Grandpapa did right, therefore, to\nwatch me. And yet, as happens too often to the grandpapas of earth, in\na contest with the admirers of granddaughters, how vainly would he have\nwatched me had I meditated any evil whispers to Fanny! She, it is my\nbelief, would have protected herself against any man’s evil suggestions.\nBut he, as the result showed, could not have intercepted the opportunities\nfor such suggestions. Yet he was still active; he was still blooming.\nBlooming he was as Fanny herself.",
        "  “Say, all our praises why should lords–”",
        "No, that’s not the line.",
        "  “Say, all our roses why should girls engross?”",
        "The coachman showed rosy blossoms on his face deeper even than his\ngranddaughter’s,–his being drawn from the ale cask, Fanny’s from youth\nand innocence, and from the fountains of the dawn. But, in spite of his\nblooming face, some infirmities he had; and one particularly (I am very\nsure, no more than one,) in which he too much resembled a crocodile. This\nlay in a monstrous inaptitude for turning round. The crocodile, I presume,\nowes that inaptitude to the absurd length of his back; but in our\ngrandpapa it arose rather from the absurd breadth of his back, combined,\nprobably, with some growing stiffness in his legs. Now upon this crocodile\ninfirmity of his I planted an easy opportunity for tendering my homage to\nMiss Fanny. In defiance of all his honorable vigilance, no sooner had he\npresented to us his mighty Jovian back (what a field for displaying to\nmankind his royal scarlet!) whilst inspecting professionally the buckles,\nthe straps, and the silver turrets of his harness, than I raised Miss\nFanny’s hand to my lips, and, by the mixed tenderness and respectfulness of\nmy manner, caused her easily to understand how happy it would have made\nme to rank upon her list as No. 10 or 12, in which case a few casualties\namongst her lovers (and observe–they hanged liberally in those days)\nmight have promoted me speedily to the top of the tree; as, on the other\nhand, with how much loyalty of submission I acquiesced in her allotment,\nsupposing that she had seen reason to plant me in the very rearward of her\nfavor, as No. 199+1. It must not be supposed that I allowed any trace\nof jest, or even of playfulness, to mingle with these expressions of my\nadmiration; that would have been insulting to her, and would have been\nfalse as regarded my own feelings. In fact, the utter shadowyness of our\nrelations to each other, even after our meetings through seven or eight\nyears had been very numerous, but of necessity had been very brief, being\nentirely on mail-coach allowance–timid, in reality, by the General\nPost-Office–and watched by a crocodile belonging to the antepenultimate\ngeneration, left it easy for me to do a thing which few people ever canhave done–viz., to make love for seven years, at the same time to be\nas sincere as ever creature was, and yet never to compromise myself by\novertures that might have been foolish as regarded my own interests,\nor misleading as regarded hers. Most truly I loved this beautiful and\ningenuous girl; and had it not been for the Bath and Bristol mail, heaven\nonly knows what might have come of it. People talk of being over head and\nears in love–now, the mail was the cause that I sank only over ears in\nlove, which, you know, still left a trifle of brain to overlook the whole\nconduct of the affair. I have mentioned the case at all for the sake of\na dreadful result from it in after years of dreaming. But it seems, ex\nabundanti, to yield this moral–viz., that as, in England, the idiot and\nthe half-wit are held to be under the guardianship of chancery, so the man\nmaking love, who is often but a variety of the same imbecile class, ought\nto be made a ward of the General Post-Office, whose severe course of\ntiming and periodical interruption might intercept many a foolish\ndeclaration, such as lays a solid foundation for fifty years’ repentance.",
        "Ah, reader! when I look back upon those days, it seems to me that all\nthings change or perish. Even thunder and lightning, it pains me to say,\nare not the thunder and lightning which I seem to remember about the\ntime of Waterloo. Roses, I fear, are degenerating, and, without a Red\nrevolution, must come to the dust. The Fannies of our island–though this\nI say with reluctance–are not improving; and the Bath road is notoriously\nsuperannuated. Mr. Waterton tells me that the crocodile does notchange–that a cayman, in fact, or an alligator, is just as good for riding\nupon as he was in the time of the Pharaohs. That may be; but the reason\nis, that the crocodile does not live fast–he is a slow coach. I believe\nit is generally understood amongst naturalists, that the crocodile is a\nblockhead. It is my own impression that the Pharaohs were also blockheads.\nNow, as the Pharaohs and the crocodile domineered over Egyptian society,\nthis accounts for a singular mistake that prevailed on the Nile. The\ncrocodile made the ridiculous blunder of supposing man to be meant chiefly\nfor his own eating. Man, taking a different view of the subject, naturally\nmet that mistake by another; he viewed the crocodile as a thing sometimes\nto worship, but always to run away from. And this continued until Mr.\nWaterton changed the relations between the animals. The mode of escaping\nfrom the reptile he showed to be, not by running away, but by leaping on\nits back, booted and spurred. The two animals had misunderstood each other.\nThe use of the crocodile has now been cleared up–it is to be ridden; and\nthe use of man is, that he may improve the health of the crocodile by\nriding him a fox-hunting before breakfast. And it is pretty certain that\nany crocodile, who has been regularly hunted through the season, and is\nmaster of the weight he carries, will take a six-barred gate now as well as\never he would have done in the infancy of the pyramids.",
        "Perhaps, therefore, the crocodile does not change, but all things else\ndo: even the shadow of the pyramids grows less. And often the restoration\nin vision of Fanny and the Bath road, makes me too pathetically sensible of\nthat truth. Out of the darkness, if I happen to call up the image of Fanny\nfrom thirty-five years back, arises suddenly a rose in June; or, if I think\nfor an instant of the rose in June, up rises the heavenly face of Fanny.\nOne after the other, like the antiphonies in the choral service, rises\nFanny and the rose in June, then back again the rose in June and Fanny.\nThen come both together, as in a chorus; roses and Fannies, Fannies and\nroses, without end–thick as blossoms in paradise. Then comes a venerable\ncrocodile, in a royal livery of scarlet and gold, or in a coat with sixteen\ncapes; and the crocodile is driving four-in-hand from the box of the\nBath mail. And suddenly we upon the mail are pulled up by a mighty dial,\nsculptured with the hours, and with the dreadful legend of TOO LATE. Then\nall at once we are arrived at Marlborough forest, amongst the lovely\nhouseholds[7] of the roe-deer: these retire into the dewy thickets; the\nthickets are rich with roses; the roses call up (as ever) the sweet\ncountenance of Fanny, who, being the granddaughter of a crocodile, awakens\na dreadful host of wild semi-legendary animals,–griffins, dragons,\nbasilisks, sphinxes,–till at length the whole vision of fighting images\ncrowds into one towering armorial shield, a vast emblazonry of human\ncharities and human loveliness that have perished, but quartered\nheraldically with unutterable horrors of monstrous and demoniac natures,\nwhilst over all rises, as a surmounting crest, one fair female hand, with\nthe fore-finger pointing, in sweet, sorrowful admonition, upwards to\nheaven, and having power (which, without experience, I never could have\nbelieved) to awaken the pathos that kills in the very bosom of the horrors\nthat madden the grief that gnaws at the heart, together with the monstrous\ncreations of darkness that shock the belief, and make dizzy the reason of\nman. This is the peculiarity that I wish the reader to notice, as having\nfirst been made known to me for a possibility by this early vision of\nFanny on the Bath road. The peculiarity consisted in the confluence of two\ndifferent keys, though apparently repelling each other, into the music\nand governing principles of the same dream; horror, such as possesses the\nmaniac, and yet, by momentary transitions, grief, such as may be supposed\nto possess the dying mother when leaving her infant children to the mercies\nof the cruel. Usually, and perhaps always, in an unshaken nervous system,\nthese two modes of misery exclude each other–here first they met in horrid\nreconciliation. There was also a separate peculiarity in the quality of the\nhorror. This was afterwards developed into far more revolting complexities\nof misery and incomprehensible darkness; and perhaps I am wrong in\nascribing any value as a causative agency to this particular case on the\nBath road–possibly it furnished merely an occasion that accidentally\nintroduced a mode of horrors certain, to any rate, to have grown up,\nwith or without the Bath road, from more advanced stages of the nervous\nderangement. Yet, as the cubs of tigers or leopards, when domesticated,\nhave been observed to suffer a sudden development of their latent ferocity\nunder too eager an appeal to their playfulness–the gaieties of sport in\nthem being too closely connected with the fiery brightness of their\nmurderous instincts–so I have remarked that the caprices, the gay\narabesques, and the lovely floral luxuriations of dreams, betray a shocking\ntendency to pass into finer maniacal splendors. That gaiety, for instance\n(for such as first it was,) in the dreaming faculty, by which one principal\npoint of resemblance to a crocodile in the mail-coachman was soon made to\nclothe him with the form of a crocodile, and yet was blended with accessory\ncircumstances derived from his human functions, passed rapidly into a\nfurther development, no longer gay or playful, but terrific, the most\nterrific that besieges dreams, viz–the horrid inoculation upon each other\nof incompatible natures. This horror has always been secretly felt by\nman; it was felt even under pagan forms of religion, which offered a very\nfeeble, and also a very limited gamut for giving expression to the human\ncapacities of sublimity or of horror. We read it in the fearful composition\nof the sphinx. The dragon, again, is the snake inoculated upon the\nscorpion. The basilisk unites the mysterious malice of the evil eye,\nunintentional on the part of the unhappy agent, with the intentional venom\nof some other malignant natures. But these horrid complexities of evil\nagency are but objectively horrid; they inflict the horror suitable to\ntheir compound nature; but there is no insinuation that they feel that\nhorror. Heraldry is so full of these fantastic creatures, that, in some\nzoologies, we find a separate chapter or a supplement dedicated to what is\ndenominated heraldic zoology. And why not? For these hideous creatures,\nhowever visionary[8], have a real traditionary ground in medieval\nbelief–sincere and partly reasonable, though adulterating with mendacity,\nblundering, credulity, and intense superstition. But the dream-horror\nwhich I speak of is far more frightful. The dreamer finds housed\nwithin himself–occupying, as it were, some separate chamber in his\nbrain–holding, perhaps, from that station a secret and detestable commerce\nwith his own heart–some horrid alien nature. What if it were his own\nnature repeated,–still, if the duality were distinctly perceptible, even\nthat–even this mere numerical double of his own consciousness–might\nbe a curse too mighty to be sustained. But how, if the alien nature\ncontradicts his own, fights with it, perplexes, and confounds it? How,\nagain, if not one alien nature, but two, but three, but four, but five, are\nintroduced within what once he thought the inviolable sanctuary of himself?\nThese, however, are horrors from the kingdoms of anarchy and darkness,\nwhich, by their very intensity, challenge the sanctity of concealment, and\ngloomily retire from exposition. Yet it was necessary to mention them,\nbecause the first introduction to such appearances (whether causal,\nor merely casual) lay in the heraldic monsters, (which monsters were\nthemselves introduced though playfully,) by the transfigured coachman of\nthe Bath mail.",
        "Going Down With Victory.",
        "But the grandest chapter of our experience, within the whole mail-coach\nservice, was on those occasions when we went down from London with the\nnews of victory. A period of about ten years stretched from Trafalgar to\nWaterloo: the second and third years of which period (1806 and 1807)\nwere comparatively sterile; but the rest, from 1805 to 1815 inclusively,\nfurnished a long succession of victories; the least of which, in a contest\nof that portentous nature, had an inappreciable value of position–partly\nfor its absolute interference with the plans of our enemy, but still\nmore from its keeping alive in central Europe the sense of a deep-seated\nvulnerability in France. Even to tease the coasts of our enemy, to mortify\nthem by continual blockades, to insult them by capturing if it were but a\nbaubling schooner under the eyes of their arrogant armies, repeated from\ntime to time a sullen proclamation of power lodged in a quarter to which\nthe hopes of Christendom turned in secret. How much more loudly must this\nproclamation have spoken in the audacity[9] of having bearded the eliteof their troops, and having beaten them in pitched battles! Five years of\nlife it was worth paying down for the privilege of an outside place on a\nmail-coach, when carrying down the first tidings of any such event. And it\nis to be noted that, from our insular situation, and the multitude of our\nfrigates disposable for the rapid transmission of intelligence, rarely\ndid any unauthorized rumor steal away a prelibation from the aroma of the\nregular dispatches. The government official news was generally the first\nnews.",
        "From eight, P.M. to fifteen or twenty minutes later, imagine the mails\nassembled on parade in Lombard Street, where, at that time, was seated the\nGeneral Post-Office. In what exact strength we mustered I do not remember;\nbut, from the length of each separate attelage, we filled the street,\nthough a long one, and though we were drawn up in double file. On anynight the spectacle was beautiful. The absolute perfection of all the\nappointments about the carriages and the harness, and the magnificence of\nthe horses, were what might first have fixed the attention. Every\ncarriage, on every morning in the year, was taken down to an inspector\nfor examination–wheels, axles, linch-pins, pole, glasses, &c., were\nall critically probed and tested. Every part of every carriage had been\ncleaned, every horse had been groomed, with as much rigor as if they\nbelonged to a private gentleman; and that part of the spectacle offered\nitself always. But the night before us is a night of victory; and behold!\nto the ordinary display, what a heart-shaking addition!–horses, men,\ncarriages–all are dressed in laurels and flowers, oak leaves and ribbons.\nThe guards, who are his majesty’s servants, and the coachmen, who are\nwithin the privilege of the post-office, wear the royal liveries of course;\nand as it is summer (for all the land victories were won in summer,) they\nwear, on this fine evening, these liveries exposed to view, without any\ncovering of upper coats. Such a costume, and the elaborate arrangement of\nthe laurels in their hats, dilated their hearts, by giving to them openly\nan official connection with the great news, in which already they have\nthe general interest of patriotism. That great national sentiment surmounts\nand quells all sense of ordinary distinctions. Those passengers who happen\nto be gentlemen are now hardly to be distinguished as such except by dress.\nThe usual reserve of their manner in speaking to the attendants has on this\nnight melted away. One heart, one pride, one glory, connects every man\nby the transcendent bond of his English blood. The spectators, who are\nnumerous beyond precedent, express their sympathy with these fervent\nfeelings by continual hurrahs. Every moment are shouted aloud by the\npost-office servants the great ancestral names of cities known to history\nthrough a thousand years,–Lincoln, Winchester, Portsmouth, Gloucester,\nOxford, Bristol, Manchester, York, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Perth,\nGlasgow–expressing the grandeur of the empire by the antiquity of its\ntowns, and the grandeur of the mail establishment by the diffusive\nradiation of its separate missions. Every moment you hear the thunder of\nlids locked down upon the mail-bags. That sound to each individual mail is\nthe signal for drawing off, which process is the finest part of the entire\nspectacle. Then come the horses into play,–horses! can these be horses\nthat (unless powerfully reined in) would bound off with the action and\ngestures of leopards? What stir!–what sea-like ferment!–what a thundering\nof wheels, what a trampling of horses!–what farewell cheers–what\nredoubling peals of brotherly congratulation, connecting the name of the\nparticular mail–\"Liverpool for ever!\"–with the name of the particular\nvictory–\"Badajoz for ever!” or “Salamanca for ever!” The half-slumbering\nconsciousness that, all night long and all the next day–perhaps for even\na longer period–many of these mails, like fire racing along a train of\ngunpowder, will be kindling at every instant new successions of burning\njoy, has an obscure effect of multiplying the victory itself, by\nmultiplying to the imagination into infinity the stages of its progressive\ndiffusion. A fiery arrow seems to be let loose, which from that moment\nis destined to travel, almost without intermission, westwards for three\nhundred[10] miles–northwards for six hundred; and the sympathy of our\nLombard Street friends at parting is exalted a hundred fold by a sort of\nvisionary sympathy with the approaching sympathies, yet unborn, which we\nare going to evoke.",
        "Liberated from the embarrassments of the city, and issuing into the broad\nuncrowded avenues of the northern suburbs, we begin to enter upon our\nnatural pace of ten miles an hour. In the broad light of the summer\nevening, the sun, perhaps, only just at the point of setting, we are\nseen from every story of every house. Heads of every age crowd to\nthe windows–young and old understand the language of our victorious\nsymbols–and rolling volleys of sympathizing cheers run along behind and\nbefore our course. The beggar, rearing himself against the wall, forgets\nhis lameness–real or assumed–thinks not of his whining trade, but stands\nerect, with bold exulting smiles, as we pass him. The victory has healed\nhim, and says–Be thou whole! Women and children, from garrets alike and\ncellars, look down or look up with loving eyes upon our gay ribbons and our\nmartial laurels–sometimes kiss their hands, sometimes hang out, as signals\nof affection, pocket handkerchiefs, aprons, dusters, anything that lies\nready to their hands. On the London side of Barnet, to which we draw near\nwithin a few minutes after nine, observe that private carriage which is\napproaching us. The weather being so warm, the glasses are all down; and\none may read, as on the stage of a theatre, everything that goes on within\nthe carriage. It contains three ladies, one likely to be “mama,” and two\nof seventeen or eighteen, who are probably her daughters. What lovely\nanimation, what beautiful unpremeditated pantomime, explaining to us every\nsyllable that passes, in these ingenuous girls! By the sudden start and\nraising of the hands, on first discovering our laurelled equipage–by the\nsudden movement and appeal to the elder lady from both of them–and by the\nheightened color on their animated countenances, we can almost hear them\nsaying–\"See, see! Look at their laurels. Oh, mama! there has been a great\nbattle in Spain; and it has been a great victory.” In a moment we are on\nthe point of passing them. We passengers–I on the box, and the two on the\nroof behind me–raise our hats, the coachman makes his professional salute\nwith the whip; the guard even, though punctilious on the matter of his\ndignity as an officer under the crown, touches his hat. The ladies move to\nus, in return, with a winning graciousness of gesture: all smile on each\nside in a way that nobody could misunderstand, and that nothing short of a\ngrand national sympathy could so instantaneously prompt. Will these ladies\nsay that we are nothing to them? Oh, no; they will not say that. They\ncannot deny–they do not deny–that for this night they are our sisters:\ngentle or simple, scholar or illiterate servant, for twelve hours to\ncome–we on the outside have the honor to be their brothers. Those poor\nwomen again, who stop to gaze upon us with delight at the entrance of\nBarnet, and seem, by their air of weariness, to be returning from labor–do\nyou mean to say that they are washerwomen and char-women? Oh, my poor\nfriend, you are quite mistaken; they are nothing of the kind. I assure you\nthey stand in a higher rank; for this one night they feel themselves by\nbirthright to be daughters of England, and answer to no humbler title.",
        "Every joy, however, even rapturous joy–such is the sad law of earth–may\ncarry with it grief, or fear of grief, to some. Three miles beyond Barnet,\nwe see approaching us another private carriage, nearly repeating the\ncircumstances of the former case. Here, also, the glasses are all\ndown–here, also, is an elderly lady seated; but the two amiable daughters\nare missing; for the single young person, sitting by the lady’s side, seems\nto be an attendant–so I judge from her dress, and her air of respectful\nreserve. The lady is in mourning; and her countenance expresses sorrow.\nAt first she does not look up; so that I believe she is not aware of our\napproach, until she hears the measured beating of our horses’ hoofs. Then\nshe raises her eyes to settle them painfully on our triumphal equipage.\nOur decorations explain the case to her at once; but she beholds them with\napparent anxiety, or even with terror. Some time before this, I, finding it\ndifficult to hit a flying mark, when embarrassed by the coachman’s person\nand reins intervening, had given to the guard a Courier evening paper,\ncontaining the gazette, for the next carriage that might pass. Accordingly\nhe tossed it in so folded that the huge capitals expressing some such\nlegend as–GLORIOUS VICTORY, might catch the eye at once. To see the paper,\nhowever, at all, interpreted as it was by our ensigns of triumph, explained\neverything; and, if the guard were right in thinking the lady to have\nreceived it with a gesture of horror, it could not be doubtful that she had\nsuffered some deep personal affliction in connection with this Spanish war.",
        "Here now was the case of one, who, having formerly suffered, might,\nerroneously perhaps, be distressing herself with anticipations of another\nsimilar suffering. That same night, and hardly three hours later, occurred\nthe reverse case. A poor woman, who too probably would find herself, in a\nday or two, to have suffered the heaviest of afflictions by the battle,\nblindly allowed herself to express an exultation so unmeasured in the\nnews, and its details, as gave to her the appearance which amongst Celtic\nHighlanders is called fey. This was at some little town, I forget what,\nwhere we happened to change horses near midnight. Some fair or wake had\nkept the people up out of their beds. We saw many lights moving about as\nwe drew near; and perhaps the most impressive scene on our route was our\nreception at this place. The flashing of torches and the beautiful radiance\nof blue lights (technically Bengal lights) upon the heads of our horses;\nthe fine effect of such a showery and ghostly illumination falling upon\nflowers and glittering laurels, whilst all around the massy darkness seemed\nto invest us with walls of impenetrable blackness, together with the\nprodigious enthusiasm of the people, composed a picture at once scenical\nand affecting. As we staid for three or four minutes, I alighted. And\nimmediately from a dismantled stall in the street, where perhaps she had\nbeen presiding at some part of the evening, advanced eagerly a middle-aged\nwoman. The sight of my newspaper it was that had drawn her attention upon\nmyself. The victory which we were carrying down to the provinces on thisoccasion was the imperfect one of Talavera. I told her the main outline of\nthe battle. But her agitation, though not the agitation of fear, but of\nexultation rather, and enthusiasm, had been so conspicuous when listening,\nand when first applying for information, that I could not but ask her if\nshe had not some relation in the Peninsular army. Oh! yes: her only son was\nthere. In what regiment? He was a trooper in the 23d Dragoons. My heart\nsank within me as she made that answer. This sublime regiment, which an\nEnglishman should never mention without raising his hat to their memory,\nhad made the most memorable and effective charge recorded in military\nannals. They leaped their horses–over a trench where they could, intoit, and with the result of death or mutilation when they could not. What\nproportion cleared the trench is nowhere stated. Those who did, closed up\nand went down upon the enemy with such divinity of fervor–(I use the\nword divinity by design: the inspiration of God must have prompted this\nmovement to those whom even then he was calling to his presence)–that two\nresults followed. As regarded the enemy, this 23d Dragoons, not, I believe,\noriginally three hundred and fifty strong, paralyzed a French column, six\nthousand strong, then ascending the hill, and fixed the gaze of the whole\nFrench army. As regarded themselves, the 23d were supposed at first to have\nbeen all but annihilated; but eventually, I believe, not so many as one in\nfour survived. And this, then, was the regiment–a regiment already for\nsome hours known to myself and all London, as stretched, by a large\nmajority, upon one bloody aceldama–in which the young trooper served whose\nmother was now talking with myself in a spirit of such hopeful enthusiasm.\nDid I tell her the truth? Had I the heart to break up her dreams? No. I\nsaid to myself, to-morrow, or the next day, she will hear the worst. For\nthis night, wherefore should she not sleep in peace? After to-morrow,\nthe chances are too many that peace will forsake her pillow. This brief\nrespite, let her owe this to my gift and my forbearance. But, if I told\nher not of the bloody price that had been paid, there was no reason for\nsuppressing the contributions from her son’s regiment to the service and\nglory of the day. For the very few words that I had time for speaking, I\ngoverned myself accordingly. I showed her not the funeral banners under\nwhich the noble regiment was sleeping. I lifted not the overshadowing\nlaurels from the bloody trench in which horse and rider lay mangled\ntogether. But I told her how these dear children of England, privates and\nofficers, had leaped their horses over all obstacles as gaily as hunters to\nthe morning’s chase. I told her how they rode their horses into the mists\nof death, (saying to myself, but not saying to her,) and laid down their\nyoung lives for thee, O mother England! as willingly–poured out their\nnoble blood as cheerfully–as ever, after a long day’s sport, when infants,\nthey had rested their wearied heads upon their mother’s knees, or had sunk\nto sleep in her arms. It is singular that she seemed to have no fears, even\nafter this knowledge that the 23d Dragoons had been conspicuously engaged,\nfor her son’s safety: but so much was she enraptured by the knowledge that\nhis regiment, and therefore he, had rendered eminent service in the\ntrying conflict–a service which had actually made them the foremost topic\nof conversation in London–that in the mere simplicity of her fervent\nnature, she threw her arms round my neck, and, poor woman, kissed me.",

Accordingly, I\nremember a case in which an American writer indulges himself in the luxury\nof a little lying, by ascribing to an Englishman a pompous account of\nthe Thames, constructed entirely upon American ideas of grandeur, and\nconcluding in something like these terms:–\"And, sir, arriving at London,\nthis mighty father of rivers attains a breadth of at least two furlongs,\nhaving, in its winding course, traversed the astonishing distance of one\nhundred and seventy miles.” And this the candid American thinks it fair to\ncontrast with the scale of the Mississippi. Now, it is hardly worth while\nto answer a pure falsehood gravely, else one might say that no Englishman\nout of Bedlam ever thought of looking in an island for the rivers of\na continent; nor, consequently, could have thought of looking for the\npeculiar grandeur of the Thames in the length of its course, or in the\nextent of soil which it drains: yet, if he had been so absurd, the\nAmerican might have recollected that a river, not to be compared with the\nThames even as to volume of water–viz. the Tiber–has contrived to make\nitself heard of in this world for twenty-five centuries to an extent\nnot reached, nor likely to be reached very soon, by any river, however\ncorpulent, of his own land. The glory of the Thames is measured by the\ndensity of the population to which it ministers, by the commerce which\nit supports, by the grandeur of the empire in which, though far from the\nlargest, it is the most influential stream. Upon some such scale, and not\nby a transfer of Columbian standards, is the course of our English mails to\nbe valued. The American may fancy the effect of his own valuations to our\nEnglish ears, by supposing the case of a Siberian glorifying his country in\nthese terms:–\"These rascals, sir, in France and England, cannot march half\na mile in any direction without finding a house where food can be had and\nlodging; whereas, such is the noble desolation of our magnificent country,\nthat in many a direction for a thousand miles, I will engage a dog shall\nnot find shelter from a snow-storm, nor a wren find an apology for\nbreakfast.\"]",
        "[THE reader is to understand this present paper, in its two sections of\nThe Vision, &c., and The Dream-Fugue, as connected with a previous\npaper on The English Mail-Coach. The ultimate object was the Dream-Fugue,\nas an attempt to wrestle with the utmost efforts of music in dealing with\na colossal form of impassioned horror. The Vision of Sudden Death contains\nthe mail-coach incident, which did really occur, and did really suggest\nthe variations of the Dream, here taken up by the Fugue, as well as other\nvariations not now recorded. Confluent with these impressions, from the\nterrific experience on the Manchester and Glasgow mail, were other and more\ngeneral impressions, derived from long familiarity with the English mail,\nas developed in the former paper; impressions, for instance, of animal\nbeauty and power, of rapid motion, at that time unprecedented, of\nconnection with the government and public business of a great nation, but,\nabove all, of connection with the national victories at an unexampled\ncrisis,–the mail being the privileged organ for publishing and dispersing\nall news of that kind.

        "What is to be thought of sudden death? It is remarkable that, in different\nconditions of society it has been variously regarded as the consummation of\nan earthly career most fervently to be desired, and, on the other hand,\nas that consummation which is most of all to be deprecated. Cæsar the\nDictator, at his last dinner party, (coena,) and the very evening before\nhis assassination, being questioned as to the mode of death which, in hisopinion, might seem the most eligible, replied–\"That which should be most\nsudden.” On the other hand, the divine Litany of our English Church, when\nbreathing forth supplications, as if in some representative character for\nthe whole human race prostrate before God, places such a death in the very\nvan of horrors. “From lightning and tempest; from plague, pestilence, and\nfamine; from battle and murder, and from sudden death,–Good Lord, deliver\nus.” Sudden death is here made to crown the climax in a grand ascent of\ncalamities; it is the last of curses; and yet, by the noblest of Romans,\nit was treated as the first of blessings. In that difference, most readers\nwill see little more than the difference between Christianity and Paganism.\nBut there I hesitate. The Christian church may be right in its estimate of\nsudden death; and it is a natural feeling, though after all it may also\nbe an infirm one, to wish for a quiet dismissal from life–as that which\nseems most reconcilable with meditation, with penitential retrospects,\nand with the humilities of farewell prayer. There does not, however, occur\nto me any direct scriptural warrant for this earnest petition of the\nEnglish Litany. It seems rather a petition indulged to human infirmity,\nthan exacted from human piety. And, however that may be, two remarks\nsuggest themselves as prudent restraints upon a doctrine, which else maywander, and has wandered, into an uncharitable superstition. The first\nis this: that many people are likely to exaggerate the horror of a sudden\ndeath, (I mean the objective horror to him who contemplates such a\ndeath, not the subjective horror to him who suffers it,) from the false\ndisposition to lay a stress upon words or acts, simply because by an\naccident they have become words or acts. If a man dies, for instance,\nby some sudden death when he happens to be intoxicated, such a death is\nfalsely regarded with peculiar horror; as though the intoxication were\nsuddenly exalted into a blasphemy. But that is unphilosophic. The man\nwas, or he was not, habitually a drunkard. If not, if his intoxication\nwere a solitary accident, there can be no reason at all for allowing\nspecial emphasis to this act, simply because through misfortune it became\nhis final act. Nor, on the other hand, if it were no accident, but one of\nhis habitual transgressions, will it be the more habitual or the more a\ntransgression, because some sudden calamity, surprising him, has caused\nthis habitual transgression to be also a final one? Could the man have had\nany reason even dimly to foresee his own sudden death, there would have\nbeen a new feature in his act of intemperance–a feature of presumption and\nirreverence, as in one that by possibility felt himself drawing near to the\npresence of God. But this is no part of the case supposed. And the only new\nelement in the man’s act is not any element of extra immorality, but simply\nof extra misfortune.",
        "The other remark has reference to the meaning of the word sudden. And it\nis a strong illustration of the duty which for ever calls us to the stern\nvaluation of words–that very possibly Cæesar and the Christian church do\nnot differ in the way supposed; that is, do not differ by any difference\nof doctrine as between Pagan and Christian views of the moral temper\nappropriate to death, but that they are contemplating different cases.\nBoth contemplate a violent death; a [Greek: biathanatos]–death that\nis [Greek: biaios]: but the difference is–that the Roman by the word\n\"sudden” means an unlingering death: whereas the Christian Litany\nby “sudden” means a death without warning, consequently without any\navailable summons to religious preparation. The poor mutineer, who kneels\ndown to gather into his heart the bullets from twelve firelocks of his\npitying comrades, dies by a most sudden death in Cæsar’s sense: one shock,\none mighty spasm, one (possibly not one) groan, and all is over. But,\nin the sense of the Litany, his death is far from sudden; his offence,\noriginally, his imprisonment, his trial, the interval between his sentence\nand its execution, having all furnished him with separate warnings of his\nfate–having all summoned him to meet it with solemn preparation.",
        "Meantime, whatever may be thought of a sudden death as a mere variety in\nthe modes of dying, where death in some shape is inevitable–a question\nwhich, equally in the Roman and the Christian sense, will be variously\nanswered according to each man’s variety of temperament–certainly, upon\none aspect of sudden death there can be no opening for doubt, that of all\nagonies incident to man it is the most frightful, that of all martyrdoms it\nis the most freezing to human sensibilities–namely, where it surprises a\nman under circumstances which offer (or which seem to offer) some hurried\nand inappreciable chance of evading it. Any effort, by which such an\nevasion can be accomplished, must be as sudden as the danger which it\naffronts. Even that, even the sickening necessity for hurrying in\nextremity where all hurry seems destined to be vain, self-baffled, and\nwhere the dreadful knell of too late is already sounding in the ears by\nanticipation–even that anguish is liable to a hideous exasperation in one\nparticular case, namely, where the agonising appeal is made not exclusively\nto the instinct of self-preservation, but to the conscience, on behalf of\nanother life besides your own, accidentally cast upon your protection. To\nfail, to collapse in a service merely your own, might seem comparatively\nvenial; though, in fact, it is far from venial. But to fail in a case where\nProvidence has suddenly thrown into your hands the final interests of\nanother–of a fellow-creature shuddering between the gates of life and\ndeath; this, to a man of apprehensive conscience, would mingle the misery\nof an atrocious criminality with the misery of a bloody calamity. The man\nis called upon, too probably, to die; but to die at the very moment when,\nby any momentary collapse, he is self-denounced as a murderer. He had but\nthe twinkling of an eye for his effort, and that effort might, at the best,\nhave been unavailing; but from this shadow of a chance, small or great, how\nif he has recoiled by a treasonable lâcheté? The effort might have been\nwithout hope; but to have risen to the level of that effort, would have\nrescued him, though not from dying, yet from dying as a traitor to his\nduties.",
        "The situation here contemplated exposes a dreadful ulcer, lurking far down\nin the depths of human nature. It is not that men generally are summoned\nto face such awful trials. But potentially, and in shadowy outline, such\na trial is moving subterraneously in perhaps all men’s natures–muttering\nunder ground in one world, to be realized perhaps in some other. Upon the\nsecret mirror of our dreams such a trial is darkly projected at intervals,\nperhaps, to every one of us. That dream, so familiar to childhood, of\nmeeting a lion, and, from languishing prostration in hope and vital energy,\nthat constant sequel of lying down before him, publishes the secret\nfrailty of human nature–reveals its deep-seated Pariah falsehood to\nitself–records its abysmal treachery. Perhaps not one of us escapes that\ndream; perhaps, as by some sorrowful doom of man, that dream repeats for\nevery one of us, through every generation, the original temptation in Eden.\nEvery one of us, in this dream, has a bait offered to the infirm places of\nhis own individual will; once again a snare is made ready for leading him\ninto captivity to a luxury of ruin; again, as in aboriginal Paradise, the\nman falls from innocence; once again, by infinite iteration, the ancient\nEarth groans to God, through her secret caves, over the weakness of her\nchild; “Nature, from her seat, sighing through all her works,” again “gives\nsigns of woe that all is lost;” and again the counter sigh is repeated to\nthe sorrowing heavens of the endless rebellion against God. Many people\nthink that one man, the patriarch of our race, could not in his single\nperson execute this rebellion for all his race. Perhaps they are wrong.\nBut, even if not, perhaps in the world of dreams every one of us ratifies\nfor himself the original act. Our English rite of “Confirmation,” by which,\nin years of awakened reason, we take upon us the engagements contracted\nfor us in our slumbering infancy,–how sublime a rite is that! The little\npostern gate, through which the baby in its cradle had been silently placed\nfor a time within the glory of God’s countenance, suddenly rises to the\nclouds as a triumphal arch, through which, with banners displayed and\nmartial pomps, we make our second entry as crusading soldiers militant\nfor God, by personal choice and by sacramental oath. Each man says in\neffect–\"Lo! I rebaptise myself; and that which once was sworn on my\nbehalf, now I swear for myself.” Even so in dreams, perhaps, under some\nsecret conflict of the midnight sleeper, lighted up to the consciousness\nat the time, but darkened to the memory as soon as all is finished, each\nseveral child of our mysterious race completes for himself the aboriginal\nfall.",
        "As I drew near to the Manchester post office, I found that it was\nconsiderably past midnight; but to my great relief, as it was important for\nme to be in Westmorland by the morning, I saw by the huge saucer eyes of\nthe mail, blazing through the gloom of overhanging houses, that my chance\nwas not yet lost. Past the time it was; but by some luck, very unusual in\nmy experience, the mail was not even yet ready to start. I ascended to\nmy seat on the box, where my cloak was still lying as it had lain at\nthe Bridgewater Arms. I had left it there in imitation of a nautical\ndiscoverer, who leaves a bit of bunting on the shore of his discovery, by\nway of warning off the ground the whole human race, and signalising to the\nChristian and the heathen worlds, with his best compliments, that he has\nplanted his throne for ever upon that virgin soil: henceforward claiming\nthe jus dominii to the top of the atmosphere above it, and also the right\nof driving shafts to the centre of the earth below it; so that all people\nfound after this warning, either aloft in the atmosphere, or in the\nshafts, or squatting on the soil, will be treated as trespassers–that is,\ndecapitated by their very faithful and obedient servant, the owner of the\nsaid bunting. Possibly my cloak might not have been respected, and the jus\ngentium might have been cruelly violated in my person–for, in the dark,\npeople commit deeds of darkness, gas being a great ally of morality–but it\nso happened that, on this night, there was no other outside passenger;\nand the crime, which else was but too probable, missed fire for want of\na criminal. By the way, I may as well mention at this point, since a\ncircumstantial accuracy is essential to the effect of my narrative, that\nthere was no other person of any description whatever about the mail–the\nguard, the coachman, and myself being allowed for–except only one–a\nhorrid creature of the class known to the world as insiders, but whom young\nOxford called sometimes “Trojans,” in opposition to our Grecian selves, and\nsometimes “vermin.” A Turkish Effendi, who piques himself on good breeding,\nwill never mention by name a pig. Yet it is but too often that he has\nreason to mention this animal; since constantly, in the streets of\nStamboul, he has his trousers deranged or polluted by this vile creature\nrunning between his legs. But under any excess of hurry he is always\ncareful, out of respect to the company he is dining with, to suppress the\nodious name, and to call the wretch “that other creature,” as though all\nanimal life beside formed one group, and this odious beast (to whom, as\nChrysippus observed, salt serves as an apology for a soul) formed another\nand alien group on the outside of creation. Now I, who am an English\nEffendi, that think myself to understand good-breeding as well as any son\nof Othman, beg my reader’s pardon for having mentioned an insider by his\ngross natural name. I shall do so no more; and, if I should have occasion\nto glance at so painful a subject, I shall always call him “that other\ncreature.” Let us hope, however, that no such distressing occasion will\narise. But, by the way, an occasion arises at this moment; for the reader\nwill be sure to ask, when we come to the story, “Was this other creature\npresent?” He was not; or more correctly, perhaps, it was not. We\ndropped the creature–or the creature, by natural imbecility, dropped\nitself–within the first ten miles from Manchester. In the latter case, I\nwish to make a philosophic remark of a moral tendency. When I die, or when\nthe reader dies, and by repute suppose of fever, it will never be known\nwhether we died in reality of the fever or of the doctor. But this other\ncreature, in the case of dropping out of the coach, will enjoy a coroner’s\ninquest; consequently he will enjoy an epitaph. For I insist upon it, that\nthe verdict of a coroner’s jury makes the best of epitaphs. It is brief, so\nthat the public all find time to read; it is pithy, so that the surviving\nfriends (if any can survive such a loss) remember it without fatigue; it\nis upon oath, so that rascals and Dr. Johnsons cannot pick holes in it.\n\"Died through the visitation of intense stupidity, by impinging on a\nmoonlight night against the off hind wheel of the Glasgow mail! Deodand\nupon the said wheel–two-pence.” What a simple lapidary inscription! Nobody\nmuch in the wrong but an off-wheel; and with few acquaintances; and if it\nwere but rendered into choice Latin, though there would be a little bother\nin finding a Ciceronian word for “off-wheel,” Marcellus himself, that great\nmaster of sepulchral eloquence, could not show a better. Why I call this\nlittle remark moral, is, from the compensation it points out. Here, by\nthe supposition, is that other creature on the one side, the beast of the\nworld; and he (or it) gets an epitaph. You and I, on the contrary, the\npride of our friends, get none.",
        "But why linger on the subject of vermin? Having mounted the box, I took a\nsmall quantity of laudanum, having already travelled two hundred and fifty\nmiles–viz., from a point seventy miles beyond London, upon a simple\nbreakfast. In the taking of laudanum there was nothing extraordinary. But\nby accident it drew upon me the special attention of my assessor on the\nbox, the coachman. And in that there was nothing extraordinary. But by\naccident, and with great delight, it drew my attention to the fact that\nthis coachman was a monster in point of size, and that he had but one eye.\nIn fact he had been foretold by Virgil as–",
        "  “Monstrum. horrendum, informe, ingens cui lumen adempium.”",
        "He answered in every point–a monster he was–dreadful, shapeless, huge,\nwho had lost an eye. But why should that delight me? Had he been one of\nthe Calendars in the Arabian Nights, and had paid down his eye as the price\nof his criminal curiosity, what right had I to exult in his misfortune? I\ndid not exult: I delighted in no man’s punishment, though it were even\nmerited. But these personal distinctions identified in an instant an old\nfriend of mine, whom I had known in the south for some years as the most\nmasterly of mail-coachmen. He was the man in all Europe that could best\nhave undertaken to drive six-in-hand full gallop over Al Sirat–that\nfamous bridge of Mahomet across the bottomless gulf, backing himself\nagainst the Prophet and twenty such fellows. I used to call him Cyclops\nmastigophorus, Cyclops the whip-bearer, until I observed that his skill\nmade whips useless, except to fetch off an impertinent fly from a leader’s\nhead; upon which I changed his Grecian name to Cyclops diphrélates(Cyclops the charioteer.) I, and others known to me, studied under him the\ndiphrelatic art. Excuse, reader, a word too elegant to be pedantic. And\nalso take this remark from me, as a gage d’amitié–that no word ever\nwas or can be pedantic which, by supporting a distinction, supports the\naccuracy of logic; or which fills up a chasm for the understanding. As a\npupil, though I paid extra fees, I cannot say that I stood high in\nhis esteem. It showed his dogged honesty, (though, observe, not his\ndiscernment,) that he could not see my merits. Perhaps we ought to excuse\nhis absurdity in this particular by remembering his want of an eye. Thatmade him blind to my merits. Irritating as this blindness was, (surely\nit could not be envy?) he always courted my conversation, in which art I\ncertainly had the whip-hand of him. On this occasion, great joy was at our\nmeeting. But what was Cyclops doing here? Had the medical men recommended\nnorthern air, or how? I collected, from such explanations as he\nvolunteered, that he had an interest at stake in a suit-at-law pending at\nLancaster; so that probably he had got himself transferred to this station,\nfor the purpose of connecting with his professional pursuits an instant\nreadiness for the calls of his lawsuit.",
        "Meantime, what are we stopping for? Surely, we’ve been waiting long enough.\nOh, this procrastinating mail, and oh this procrastinating post-office!\nCan’t they take a lesson upon that subject from me? Some people have\ncalled me procrastinating. Now you are witness, reader, that I was in\ntime for them. But can they lay their hands on their hearts, and say\nthat they were in time for me? I, during my life, have often had to wait\nfor the post-office; the post-office never waited a minute for me. What are\nthey about? The guard tells me that there is a large extra accumulation of\nforeign mails this night, owing to irregularities caused by war and by the\npacket service, when as yet nothing is done by steam. For an extra hour,\nit seems, the post-office has been engaged in threshing out the pure\nwheaten correspondence of Glasgow, and winnowing it from the chaff of all\nbaser intermediate towns. We can hear the flails going at this moment. But\nat last all is finished. Sound your horn, guard. Manchester, good bye;\nwe’ve lost an hour by your criminal conduct at the post-office; which,\nhowever, though I do not mean to part with a serviceable ground of\ncomplaint, and one which really is such for the horses, to me secretly is\nan advantage, since it compels us to recover this last hour amongst the\nnext eight or nine. Off we are at last, and at eleven miles an hour; and at\nfirst I detect no changes in the energy or in the skill of Cyclops.",
        "From Manchester to Kendal, which virtually (though not in law) is the\ncapital of Westmoreland, were at this time seven stages of eleven miles\neach. The first five of these, dated from Manchester, terminated in\nLancaster, which was therefore fifty-five miles north of Manchester, and\nthe same distance exactly from Liverpool. The first three terminated in\nPreston, (called, by way of distinction from other towns of that name,\nproud Preston,) at which place it was that the separate roads from\nLiverpool and from Manchester to the north became confluent. Within these\nfirst three stages lay the foundation, the progress, and termination of our\nnight’s adventure. During the first stage, I found out that Cyclops was\nmortal: he was liable to the shocking affection of sleep–a thing which I\nhad never previously suspected. If a man is addicted to the vicious habit\nof sleeping, all the skill in aurigation of Apollo himself, with the horses\nof Aurora to execute the motions of his will, avail him nothing. “Oh,\nCyclops!” I exclaimed more than once, “Cyclops, my friend; thou art mortal.\nThou snorest.” Through this first eleven miles, however, he betrayed\nhis infirmity–which I grieve to say he shared with the whole Pagan\nPantheon–only by short stretches. On waking up, he made an apology for\nhimself, which, instead of mending the matter, laid an ominous foundation\nfor coming disasters. The summer assizes were now proceeding at Lancaster:\nin consequence of which, for three nights and three days, he had not lain\ndown in a bed. During the day, he was waiting for his uncertain summons as\na witness on the trial in which he was interested; or he was drinking with\nthe other witnesses, under the vigilant surveillance of the attorneys.\nDuring the night, or that part of it when the least temptations existed to\nconviviality, he was driving. Throughout the second stage he grew more and\nmore drowsy. In the second mile of the third stage, he surrendered himself\nfinally and without a struggle to his perilous temptation. All his past\nresistance had but deepened the weight of this final oppression. Seven\natmospheres of sleep seemed resting upon him; and, to consummate the case,\nour worthy guard, after singing “Love amongst the Roses,” for the fiftieth\nor sixtieth time, without any invitation from Cyclops or myself, and\nwithout applause for his poor labors, had moodily resigned himself to\nslumber–not so deep doubtless as the coachman’s, but deep enough for\nmischief; and having, probably, no similar excuse. And thus at last, about\nten miles from Preston, I found myself left in charge of his Majesty’s\nLondon and Glasgow mail, then running about eleven miles an hour.",
        "What made this negligence less criminal than else it must have been\nthought, was the condition of the roads at night during the assizes. At\nthat time all the law business of populous Liverpool, and of populous\nManchester, with its vast cincture of populous rural districts, was called\nup by ancient usage to the tribunal of Lilliputian Lancaster. To break up\nthis old traditional usage required a conflict with powerful established\ninterests, a large system of new arrangements, and a new parliamentary\nstatute. As things were at present, twice in the year so vast a body of\nbusiness rolled northwards, from the southern quarter of the county, that\na fortnight at least occupied the severe exertions of two judges for its\ndispatch. The consequence of this was–that every horse available for such\na service, along the whole line of road, was exhausted in carrying down the\nmultitudes of people who were parties to the different suits. By sunset,\ntherefore, it usually happened that, through utter exhaustion amongst\nmen and horses, the roads were all silent. Except exhaustion in the vast\nadjacent county of York from a contested election, nothing like it was\nordinarily witnessed in England.",
        "On this occasion, the usual silence and solitude prevailed along the road.\nNot a hoof nor a wheel was to be heard. And to strengthen this false\nluxurious confidence in the noiseless roads, it happened also that the\nnight was one of peculiar solemnity and peace. I myself, though slightly\nalive to the possibilities of peril, had so far yielded to the influence of\nthe mighty calm as to sink into a profound reverie. The month was August,\nin which lay my own birth-day; a festival to every thoughtful man\nsuggesting solemn and often sigh-born thoughts.[1] The county was my own\nnative county–upon which, in its southern section, more than upon any\nequal area known to man past or present, had descended the original curse\nof labour in its heaviest form, not mastering the bodies of men only as of\nslaves, or criminals in mines, but working through the fiery will. Upon no\nequal space of earth, was, or ever had been, the same energy of human\npower put forth daily. At this particular season also of the assizes, that\ndreadful hurricane of flight and pursuit, as it might have seemed to a\nstranger, that swept to and from Lancaster all day long, hunting the\ncounty up and down, and regularly subsiding about sunset, united with the\npermanent distinction of Lancashire as the very metropolis and citadel of\nlabour, to point the thoughts pathetically upon that counter vision of\nrest, of saintly repose from strife and sorrow, towards which, as to their\nsecret haven, the profounder aspirations of man’s heart are continually\ntravelling. Obliquely we were nearing the sea upon our left, which also\nmust, under the present circumstances, be repeating the general state of\nhalcyon repose. The sea, the atmosphere, the light, bore an orchestral part\nin this universal lull. Moonlight, in the first timid tremblings of the\ndawn, were now blending: and the blendings were brought into a still more\nexquisite state of unity, by a slight silvery mist, motionless and dreamy,\nthat covered the woods and fields, but with a veil of equable transparency.\nExcept the feet of our own horses, which, running on a sandy margin of the\nroad, made little disturbance, there was no sound abroad. In the clouds,\nand on the earth, prevailed the same majestic peace; and in spite of all\nthat the villain of a schoolmaster has done for the ruin of our sublimer\nthoughts, which are the thoughts of our infancy, we still believe in no\nsuch nonsense as a limited atmosphere. Whatever we may swear with our false\nfeigning lips, in our faithful hearts we still believe, and must for ever\nbelieve, in fields of air traversing the total gulf between earth and the\ncentral heavens. Still, in the confidence of children that tread without\nfear every chamber in their father’s house, and to whom no door is\nclosed, we, in that Sabbatic vision which sometimes is revealed for an hour\nupon nights like this, ascend with easy steps from the sorrow-stricken\nfields of earth, upwards to the sandals of God.",
        "[Footnote 1: “Sigh-born:” I owe the suggestion of this word to an obscure\nremembrance of a beautiful phrase in Giraldus Gambrensis, viz., suspiriosæ\ncogilationes.]",
        "Suddenly from thoughts like these, I was awakened to a sullen sound, as\nof some motion on the distant road. It stole upon the air for a moment; I\nlistened in awe; but then it died away. Once roused, however, I could not\nbut observe with alarm the quickened motion of our horses. Ten years’\nexperience had made my eye learned in the valuing of motion; and I saw that\nwe were now running thirteen miles an hour. I pretend to no presence of\nmind. On the contrary, my fear is, that I am miserably and shamefully\ndeficient in that quality as regards action. The palsy of doubt and\ndistraction hangs like some guilty weight of dark unfathomed remembrances\nupon my energies, when the signal is flying for action. But, on the other\nhand, this accursed gift I have, as regards thought, that in the first\nstep towards the possibility of a misfortune, I see its total evolution: in\nthe radix I see too certainly and too instantly its entire expansion; in\nthe first syllable of the dreadful sentence, I read already the last. It\nwas not that I feared for ourselves. What could injure us? Our bulk and\nimpetus charmed us against peril in any collision. And I had rode through\ntoo many hundreds of perils that were frightful to approach, that were\nmatter of laughter as we looked back upon them, for any anxiety to rest\nupon our interests. The mail was not built, I felt assured, nor bespoke,\nthat could betray me who trusted to its protection. But any carriage that\nwe could meet would be frail and light in comparison of ourselves. And I\nremarked this ominous accident of our situation. We were on the wrong side\nof the road. But then the other party, if other there was, might also be on\nthe wrong side; and two wrongs might make a right. That was not likely.\nThe same motive which had drawn us to the right-hand side of the road,\nviz., the soft beaten sand, as contrasted with the paved centre, would\nprove attractive to others. Our lamps, still lighted, would give the\nimpression of vigilance on our part. And every creature that met us, would\nrely upon us for quartering.[1] All this, and if the separate links of\nthe anticipation had been a thousand times more, I saw–not discursively or\nby effort–but as by one flash of horrid intuition.",
        "[Footnote 1: ’Quartering\"–this is the technical word; and, I presume\nderived from the French carlayer, to evade a rut or any obstacle.]",
        "Under this steady though rapid anticipation of the evil which might be\ngathering ahead, ah, reader! what a sullen mystery of fear, what a sigh of\nwoe, seemed to steal upon the air, as again the far-off sound of a\nwheel was heard! A whisper it was–a whisper from, perhaps, four miles\noff–secretly announcing a ruin that, being foreseen, was not the less\ninevitable. What could be done–who was it that could do it–to check the\nstorm-flight of these maniacal horses? What! could I not seize the reins\nfrom the grasp of the slumbering coachman? You, reader, think that it would\nhave been in your power to do so. And I quarrel not with your estimate of\nyourself. But, from the way in which the coachman’s hand was viced between\nhis upper and lower thigh, this was impossible. The guard subsequently\nfound it impossible, after this danger had passed. Not the grasp only, but\nalso the position of this Polyphemus, made the attempt impossible. You\nstill think otherwise. See, then, that bronze equestrian statue. The cruel\nrider has kept the bit in his horse’s mouth for two centuries. Unbridle\nhim, for a minute, if you please, and wash his mouth with water. Or stay,\nreader, unhorse me that marble emperor; knock me those marble feet from\nthose marble stirrups of Charlemagne.",
        "The sounds ahead strengthened, and were now too clearly the sounds of\nwheels. Who and what could it be? Was it industry in a taxed cart? Was it\nyouthful gaiety in a gig? Whoever it was, something must be attempted to\nwarn them. Upon the other party rests the active responsibility, but upon\nus–and, woe is me! that us was my single self–rest the responsibility\nof warning. Yet, how should this be accomplished? Might I not seize the\nguard’s horn? Already, on the first thought, I was making my way over the\nroof to the guard’s seat. But this, from the foreign mails being piled upon\nthe roof, was a difficult, and even dangerous attempt, to one cramped by\nnearly three hundred miles of outside travelling. And, fortunately, before\nI had lost much time in the attempt, our frantic horses swept round an\nangle of the road, which opened upon us the stage where the collision must\nbe accomplished, the parties that seemed summoned to the trial, and the\nimpossibility of saving them by any communication with the guard.",
        "Before us lay an avenue, straight as an arrow, six hundred yards, perhaps,\nin length; and the umbrageous trees, which rose in a regular line from\neither side, meeting high overhead, gave to it the character of a cathedral\naisle. These trees lent a deeper solemnity to the early light; but there\nwas still light enough to perceive, at the further end of this gothic\naisle, a light, reedy gig, in which were seated a young man, and, by his\nside, a young lady. Ah, young sir! what are you about? If it is necessary\nthat you should whisper your communications to this young lady–though\nreally I see nobody at this hour, and on this solitary road, likely to\noverhear your conversation–is it, therefore, necessary that you should\ncarry your lips forward to hers? The little carriage is creeping on at one\nmile an hour; and the parties within it, being thus tenderly engaged, are\nnaturally bending down their heads. Between them and eternity, to all human\ncalculation, there is but a minute and a half. What is it that I shall do?\nStrange it is, and to a mere auditor of the tale, might seem laughable,\nthat I should need a suggestion from the Iliad to prompt the sole\nrecourse that remained. But so it was. Suddenly I remembered the shout of\nAchilles, and its effect. But could I pretend to shout like the son of\nPeleus, aided by Pallas? No, certainly: but then I needed not the shout\nthat should alarm all Asia militant; a shout would suffice, such as should\ncarry terror into the hearts of two thoughtless young people, and one\ngig horse. I shouted–and the young man heard me not. A second time I\nshouted–and now he heard me, for now he raised his head.",
        "Here, then, all had been done that, by me, could be done: more on mypart was not possible. Mine had been the first step: the second was for the\nyoung man: the third was for God. If, said I, the stranger is a brave man,\nand if, indeed, he loves the young girl at his side–or, loving her not, if\nhe feels the obligation pressing upon every man worthy to be called a man,\nof doing his utmost for a woman confided to his protection–he will at\nleast make some effort to save her. If that fails, he will not perish the\nmore, or by a death more cruel, for having made it; and he will die as a\nbrave man should, with his face to the danger, and with his arm about the\nwoman that he sought in vain to save. But if he makes no effort, shrinking,\nwithout a struggle, from his duty, he himself will not the less certainly\nperish for this baseness of poltroonery. He will die no less: and why not?\nWherefore should we grieve that there is one craven less in the world? No;\nlet him perish, without a pitying thought of ours wasted upon him; and,\nin that case, all our grief will be reserved for the fate of the helpless\ngirl, who now, upon the least shadow of failure in him, must, by the\nfiercest of translations–must, without time for a prayer–must, within\nseventy seconds, stand before the judgment-seat of God.",
        "But craven he was not: sudden had been the call upon him, and sudden was\nhis answer to the call. He saw, he heard, he comprehended, the ruin that\nwas coming down: already its gloomy shadow darkened above him; and already\nhe was measuring his strength to deal with it. Ah! what a vulgar thing does\ncourage seem, when we see nations buying it and selling it for a shilling a\nday: ah! what a sublime thing does courage seem, when some fearful crisis\non the great deeps of life carries a man, as if running before a hurricane,\nup to the giddy crest of some mountainous wave, from which accordingly as\nhe chooses his course, he describes two courses, and a voice says to him\naudibly, “This way lies hope; take the other way and mourn for ever!” Yet,\neven then, amidst the raving of the seas and the frenzy of the danger, the\nman is able to confront his situation–is able to retire for a moment\ninto solitude with God, and to seek all his counsel from him! For seven\nseconds, it might be, of his seventy, the stranger settled his countenance\nsteadfastly upon us, as if to search and value every element in the\nconflict before him. For five seconds more he sate immovably, like one that\nmused on some great purpose. For five he sate with eyes upraised, like one\nthat prayed in sorrow, under some extremity of doubt, for wisdom to guide\nhim towards the better choice. Then suddenly he rose; stood upright; and,\nby a sudden strain upon the reins, raising his horse’s forefeet from the\nground, he slewed him round on the pivot of his hind legs, so as to plant\nthe little equipage in a position nearly at right angles to ours. Thus\nfar his condition was not improved; except as a first step had been taken\ntowards the possibility of a second. If no more were done, nothing was\ndone; for the little carriage still occupied the very centre of our path,\nthough in an altered direction. Yet even now it may not be too late:\nfifteen of the twenty seconds may still be unexhausted; and one almighty\nbound forward may avail to clear the ground. Hurry then; hurry! for the\nflying moments–they hurry! Oh hurry, hurry, my brave young man! for the\ncruel hoofs of our horses–they also hurry! Fast are the flying moments,\nfaster are the hoofs of our horses. Fear not for him, if human energy can\nsuffice: faithful was he that drove, to his terrific duty; faithful was the\nhorse to his command. One blow, one impulse given with voice and hand by\nthe stranger, one rush from the horse, one bound as if in the act of rising\nto a fence, landed the docile creature’s forefeet upon the crown or arching\ncentre of the road. The larger half of the little equipage had then cleared\nour over-towering shadow: that was evident even to my own agitated sight.\nBut it mattered little that one wreck should float off in safety, if upon\nthe wreck that perished were embarked the human freightage. The rear part\nof the carriage–was that certainly beyond the line of absolute ruin?\nWhat power could answer the question? Glance of eye, thought of man, wing\nof angel, which of these had speed enough to sweep between the question and\nthe answer, and divide the one from the other? Light does not tread upon\nthe steps of light more indivisibly, than did our all-conquering arrival\nupon the escaping efforts of the gig. That must the young man have felt\ntoo plainly. His back was now turned to us; not by sight could he any\nlonger communicate with the peril; but by the dreadful rattle of our\nharness, too truly had his ear been instructed–that all was finished as\nregarded any further effort of his. Already in resignation he had rested\nfrom his struggle; and perhaps, in his heart he was whispering–\"Father,\nwhich art above, do thou finish in heaven what I on earth have attempted.\"\nWe ran past them faster than ever mill-race in our inexorable flight. Oh,\nraving of hurricanes that must have sounded in their young ears at the\nmoment of our transit! Either with the swingle-bar, or with the haunch of\nour near leader, we had struck the off-wheel of the little gig, which stood\nrather obliquely and not quite so far advanced as to be accurately parallel\nwith the near wheel. The blow, from the fury of our passage, resounded\nterrifically. I rose in horror, to look upon the ruins we might have\ncaused. From my elevated station I looked down., and looked back upon the\nscene, which in a moment told its tale, and wrote all its records on my\nheart for ever.",
        "The horse was planted immovably, with his fore-feet upon the paved crest of\nthe central road. He of the whole party was alone untouched by the passion\nof death. The little cany carriage–partly perhaps from the dreadful\ntorsion of the wheels in its recent movement, partly from the thundering\nblow we had given to it–as if it sympathized with human horror, was all\nalive with tremblings and shiverings. The young man sat like a rock. He\nstirred not at all. But his was the steadiness of agitation frozen into\nrest by horror. As yet he dared not to look round; for he knew that, if\nanything remained to do, by him it could no longer be done. And as yet he\nknew not for certain if their safety were accomplished. But the lady–",
        "But the lady–! Oh heavens! will that spectacle ever depart from my dreams,\nas she rose and sank upon her seat, sank and rose, threw up her arms wildly\nto heaven, clutched at some visionary object in the air, fainting, praying,\nraving, despairing! Figure to yourself, reader, the elements of the case;\nsuffer me to recall before your mind the circumstances of the unparalleled\nsituation. From the silence and deep peace of this saintly summer\nnight–from the pathetic blending of this sweet moonlight, dawnlight,\ndreamlight–from the manly tenderness of this flattering, whispering,\nmurmuring love–suddenly as from the woods and fields–suddenly as from\nthe chambers of the air opening in revelation–suddenly as from the ground\nyawning at her feet, leaped upon her, with the flashing of cataracts, Death\nthe crowned phantom, with all the equipage of his terrors, and the tiger\nroar of his voice.",
        "The moments were numbered. In the twinkling of an eye our flying horses had\ncarried us to the termination of the umbrageous aisle; at right angles we\nwheeled into our former direction; the turn of the road carried the scene\nout of my eyes in an instant, and swept it into my dreams for ever.",

        "Lo, it is summer, almighty summer! The everlasting gates of life and summer\nare thrown open wide; and on the ocean, tranquil and verdant as a savanna,\nthe unknown lady from the dreadful vision and I myself are floating: she\nupon a fairy pinnace, and I upon an English three-decker. But both of\nus are wooing gales of festal happiness within the domain of our common\ncountry–within that ancient watery park–within that pathless chase where\nEngland takes her pleasure as a huntress through winter and summer, and\nwhich stretches from the rising to the setting sun. Ah! what a wilderness\nof floral beauty was hidden, or was suddenly revealed, upon the tropic\nislands, through which the pinnace moved. And upon her deck what a bevy\nof human flowers–young women how lovely, young men how noble, that were\ndancing together, and slowly drifting towards us amidst music and\nincense, amidst blossoms from forests and gorgeous corymbi from vintages,\namidst natural caroling and the echoes of sweet girlish laughter. Slowly\nthe pinnace nears us, gaily she hails us, and slowly she disappears beneath\nthe shadow of our mighty bows. But then, as at some signal from heaven, the\nmusic and the carols, and the sweet echoing of girlish laughter–all are\nhushed. What evil has smitten the pinnace, meeting or overtaken her? Did\nruin to our friends couch within our own dreadful shadow? Was our shadow\nthe shadow of death? I looked over the bow for an answer; and, behold! the\npinnace was dismantled; the revel and the revellers were found no more; the\nglory of the vintage was dust; and the forest was left without a witness to\nits beauty upon the seas. “But where,” and I turned to our own crew–\"Where\nare the lovely women that danced beneath the awning of flowers and\nclustering corymbi? Whither have fled the noble young men that danced with\nthem?” Answer there was none. But suddenly the man at the mast-head,\nwhose countenance darkened with alarm, cried out–\"Sail on the weather\nbeam! Down she comes upon us: in seventy seconds she will founder!”",
        "2.",
        "I looked to the weather side, and the summer had departed. The sea was\nrocking, and shaken with gathering wrath. Upon its surface sate mighty\nmists, which grouped themselves into arches and long cathedral aisles. Down\none of these, with the fiery pace of a quarrel from a cross-bow, ran a\nfrigate right athwart our course. “Are they mad?” some voice exclaimed from\nour deck. “Are they blind? Do they woo their ruin?” But in a moment, as she\nwas close upon us, some impulse of a heady current or sudden vortex gave a\nwheeling bias to her course, and off she forged without a shock. As she ran\npast us, high aloft amongst the shrouds stood the lady of the pinnace. The\ndeeps opened ahead in malice to receive her, towering surges of foam ran\nafter her, the billows were fierce to catch her. But far away she was borne\ninto desert spaces of the sea: whilst still by sight I followed her, as she\nran before the howling gale, chased by angry sea-birds and by maddening\nbillows; still I saw her, as at the moment when she ran past us, amongst\nthe shrouds, with her white draperies streaming before the wind. There\nshe stood with hair dishevelled, one hand clutched amongst the\ntackling–rising, sinking, fluttering, trembling, praying–there for\nleagues I saw her as she stood, raising at intervals one hand to heaven,\namidst the fiery crests of the pursuing waves and the raving of the storm;\nuntil at last, upon a sound from afar of malicious laughter and mockery,\nall was hidden for ever in driving showers; and afterwards, but when I know\nnot, and how I know not.",

        "Sweet funeral bells from some incalculable distance, wailing over the dead\nthat die before the dawn, awakened me as I slept in a boat moored to some\nfamiliar shore. The morning twilight even then was breaking; and, by the\ndusky revelations which it spread, I saw a girl adorned with a garland\nof white roses about her head for some great festival, running along the\nsolitary strand with extremity of haste. Her running was the running of\npanic; and often she looked back as to some dreadful enemy in the rear. But\nwhen I leaped ashore, and followed on her steps to warn her of a peril in\nfront, alas! from me she fled as from another peril; and vainly I shouted\nto her of quicksands that lay ahead. Faster and faster she ran; round a\npromontory of rocks she wheeled out of sight; in an instant I also wheeled\nround it, but only to see the treacherous sands gathering above her head.\nAlready her person was buried; only the fair young head and the diadem of\nwhite roses around it were still visible to the pitying heavens; and, last\nof all, was visible one marble arm. I saw by the early twilight this fair\nyoung head, as it was sinking down to darkness–saw this marble arm, as it\nrose above her head and her treacherous grave, tossing, faultering,\nrising, clutching as at some false deceiving hand stretched out from the\nclouds–saw this marble arm uttering her dying hope, and then her dying\ndespair. The head, the diadem, the arm,–these all had sunk; at last over\nthese also the cruel quicksand had closed; and no memorial of the fair\nyoung girl remained on earth, except my own solitary tears, and the funeral\nbells from the desert seas, that, rising again more softly, sang a requiem\nover the grave of the buried child, and over her blighted dawn.",
        "I sate, and wept in secret the tears that men have ever given to the memory\nof those that died before the dawn, and by the treachery of earth, our\nmother. But the tears and funeral bells were hushed suddenly by a shout\nas of many nations, and by a roar as from some great king’s artillery\nadvancing rapidly along the valleys, and heard afar by its echoes among\nthe mountains. “Hush!” I said, as I bent my ear earthwards to\nlisten–\"hush!–this either is the very anarchy of strife, or else\"–and\nthen I listened more profoundly, and said as I raised my head–\"or else, oh\nheavens! it is victory that swallows up all strife.”",

        "Immediately, in trance, I was carried over land and sea to some distant\nkingdom, and placed upon a triumphal car, amongst companions crowned with\nlaurel. The darkness of gathering midnight, brooding over all the land, hid\nfrom us the mighty crowds that were weaving restlessly about our carriage\nas a centre–we heard them, but we saw them not. Tidings had arrived,\nwithin an hour, of a grandeur that measured itself against centuries; too\nfull of pathos they were, too full of joy that acknowledged no fountain\nbut God, to utter themselves by other language than by tears, by restles\nanthems, by reverberations rising from every choir, of the Gloria in\nexcelsis. These tidings we that sate upon the laurelled car had it for our\nprivilege to publish amongst all nations. And already, by signs audible\nthrough the darkness, by snortings and tramplings, our angry horses, that\nknew no fear of fleshly weariness, upbraided us with delay. Wherefore wasit that we delayed? We waited for a secret word, that should bear witness\nto the hope of nations, as now accomplished for ever. At midnight the\nsecret word arrived; which word was–Waterloo and Recovered Christendom!\nThe dreadful word shone by its own light; before us it went; high above our\nleaders’ heads it rode, and spread a golden light over the paths which we\ntraversed. Every city, at the presence of the secret word, threw open its\ngates to receive us. The rivers were silent as we crossed. All the infinite\nforests, as we ran along their margins, shivered in homage to the secret\nword. And the darkness comprehended it.",
        "Two hours after midnight we reached a mighty minster. Its gates, which rose\nto the clouds, were closed. But when the dreadful word, that rode before\nus, reached them with its golden light, silently they moved back upon their\nhinges; and at a flying gallop our equipage entered the grand aisle of the\ncathedral. Headlong was our pace; and at every altar, in the little chapels\nand oratories to the right hand and left of our course, the lamps, dying or\nsickening, kindled anew in sympathy with the secret word that was flying\npast. Forty leagues we might have run in the cathedral, and as yet no\nstrength of morning light had reached us, when we saw before us the aërial\ngalleries of the organ and the choir. Every pinnacle of the fretwork, every\nstation of advantage amongst the traceries, was crested by white-robed\nchoristers, that sang deliverance; that wept no more tears, as once their\nfathers had wept; but at intervals that sang together to the generations,\nsaying–",
        "  “Chaunt the deliverer’s praise in every tongue,”",
        "and receiving answers from afar,",
        "  –\"such as once in heaven and earth were sung.”",
        "And of their chaunting was no end; of our headlong pace was neither pause\nnor remission.",
        "Thus, as we ran like torrents–thus, as we swept with bridal rapture over\nthe Campo Santo[1] of the cathedral graves–suddenly we became aware of\na vast necropolis rising upon the far-off horizon–a city of sepulchres,\nbuilt within the saintly cathedral for the warrior dead that rested from\ntheir feuds on earth. Of purple granite was the necropolis; yet, in the\nfirst minute, it lay like a purple stain upon the horizon–so mighty was\nthe distance. In the second minute it trembled through many changes,\ngrowing into terraces and towers of wondrous altitude, so mighty was the\npace. In the third minute already, with our dreadful gallop, we were\nentering its suburbs. Vast sarcophagi rose on every side, having towers and\nturrets that, upon the limits of the central aisle, strode forward with\nhaughty intrusion, that ran back with mighty shadows into answering\nrecesses. Every sarcophagus showed many bas-reliefs–bas-reliefs of\nbattles–bas-reliefs of battle-fields; of battles from forgotten ages–of\nbattles from yesterday–of battle-fields that, long since, nature had\nhealed and reconciled to herself with the sweet oblivion of flowers–of\nbattle-fields that were yet angry and crimson with carnage. Where the\nterraces ran, there did we run; where the towers curved, there did wecurve. With the flight of swallows our horses swept round every angle. Like\nrivers in flood, wheeling round headlands; like hurricanes that side\ninto the secrets of forests; faster than ever light unwove the mazes of\ndarkness, our flying equipage carried earthly passions–kindled warrior\ninstincts–amongst the dust that lay around us; dust oftentimes of our\nnoble fathers that had slept in God from Créci to Trafalgar. And now had we\nreached the last sarcophagus, now were we abreast of the last bas-relief,\nalready had we recovered the arrow-like flight of the illimitable central\naisle, when coming up this aisle to meet us we beheld a female infant that\nrode in a carriage as frail as flowers. The mists, which went before her,\nhid the fawns that drew her, but could not hide the shells and tropic\nflowers with which she played–but could not hide the lovely smiles by\nwhich she uttered her trust in the mighty cathedral, and in the cherubim\nthat looked down upon her from the topmast shafts of its pillars. Face to\nface she was meeting us; face to face she rode, as if danger there were\nnone. “Oh, baby!” I exclaimed, “shalt thou be the ransom for Waterloo? Must\nwe, that carry tidings of great joy to every people, be messengers of ruin\nto thee?” In horror I rose at the thought; but then also, in horror at the\nthought, rose one that was sculptured on the bas-relief–a dying trumpeter.\nSolemnly from the field of battle he rose to his feet; and, unslinging\nhis stony trumpet, carried it, in his dying anguish, to his stony\nlips–sounding once, and yet once again; proclamation that, in thy ears,\noh baby! must have spoken from the battlements of death. Immediately deep\nshadows fell between us, and aboriginal silence. The choir had ceased to\nsing. The hoofs of our horses, the rattling of our harness, alarmed the\ngraves no more. By horror the bas-relief had been unlocked into life. By\nhorror we, that were so full of life, we men and our horses, with their\nfiery fore-legs rising in mid air to their everlasting gallop, were frozen\nto a bas-relief. Then a third time the trumpet sounded; the seals were\ntaken off all pulses; life, and the frenzy of life, tore into their\nchannels again; again the choir burst forth in sunny grandeur, as from\nthe muffling of storms and darkness; again the thunderings of our horses\ncarried temptation into the graves. One cry burst from our lips as the\nclouds, drawing off from the aisle, showed it empty before us–\"Whither has\nthe infant fled?–is the young child caught up to God?” Lo! afar off, in a\nvast recess, rose three mighty windows to the clouds: and on a level with\ntheir summits, at height insuperable to man, rose an altar of purest\nalabaster. On its eastern face was trembling a crimson glory. Whence came\nthat? Was it from the reddening dawn that now streamed through the\nwindows? Was it from the crimson robes of the martyrs that were painted\non the windows? Was it from the bloody bas-reliefs of earth? Whencesoever\nit were–there, within that crimson radiance, suddenly appeared a female\nhead, and then a female figure. It was the child–now grown up to woman’s\nheight. Clinging to the horns of the altar, there she stood–sinking,\nrising, trembling, fainting–raving, despairing; and behind the volume of\nincense that, night and day, streamed upwards from the altar, was seen the\nfiery font, and dimly was descried the outline of the dreadful being that\nshould baptize her with the baptism of death. But by her side was kneeling\nher better angel, that hid his face with wings; that wept and pleaded for\nher; that prayed when she could not; that fought with heaven by tears\nfor her deliverance; which also, as he raised his immortal countenance\nfrom his wings, I saw, by the glory in his eye, that he had won at last.",
        "[Footnote 1: Campo Santo.–It is probable that most of my readers will be\nacquainted with the history of the Campo Santo at Pisa–composed of earth\nbrought from Jerusalem for a bed of sanctity, as the highest prize which\nthe noble piety of crusaders could ask or imagine. There is another Campo\nSanto at Naples, formed, however, (I presume,) on the example given by\nPisa. Possibly the idea may have been more extensively copied. To readers\nwho are unacquainted with England, or who (being English) are yet\nunacquainted with the cathedral cities of England, it may be right to\nmention that the graves within-side the cathedrals often form a flat\npavement over which carriages and horses might roll; and perhaps a boyish\nremembrance of one particular cathedral, across which I had seen passengers\nwalk and burdens carried, may have assisted my dream.]",
        "5.",
        "Then rose the agitation, spreading through the infinite cathedral, to its\nagony; then was completed the passion of the mighty fugue. The golden\ntubes of the organ, which as yet had but sobbed and muttered at\nintervals–gleaming amongst clouds and surges of incense–threw up, as\nfrom fountains unfathomable, columns of heart-shattering music. Choir\nand anti-choir were filling fast with unknown voices. Thou also, Dying\nTrumpeter!–with thy love that was victorious, and thy anguish that was\nfinishing, didst enter the tumult: trumpet and echo–farewell love, and\nfarewell anguish–rang through the dreadful sanctus. We, that spread\nflight before us, heard the tumult, as of flight, mustering behind us. In\nfear we looked round for the unknown steps that, in flight or in pursuit,\nwere gathering upon our own. Who were these that followed? The faces, which\nno man could count–whence were they? “Oh, darkness of the grave!” I\nexclaimed, “that from the crimson altar and from the fiery font wert\nvisited with secret light–that wert searched by the effulgence in the\nangel’s eye–were these indeed thy children? Pomps of life, that, from the\nburials of centuries, rose again to the voice of perfect joy, could it be\nye that had wrapped me in the reflux of panic?” What ailed me, that I\nshould fear when the triumphs of earth were advancing? Ah! Pariah heart\nwithin me, that couldst never hear the sound of joy without sullen whispers\nof treachery in ambush; that, from six years old, didst never hear the\npromise of perfect love, without seeing aloft amongst the stars fingers\nas of a man’s hand, writing the secret legend–\"Ashes to ashes, dust to\ndust!\"–wherefore shouldst thou not fear, though all men should rejoice?\nLo! as I looked back for seventy leagues through the mighty cathedral, and\nsaw the quick and the dead that sang together to God, together that sang\nto the generations of man–ah! raving, as of torrents that opened on every\nside: trepidation, as of female and infant steps that fled–ah! rushing,\nas of wings that chase! But I heard a voice from heaven, which said–\"Let\nthere be no reflux of panic–let there be no more fear, and no more sudden\ndeath! Cover them with joy as the tides cover the shore!” That heard the\nchildren of the choir, that heard the children of the grave. All the\nhosts of jubilation made ready to move. Like armies that ride in pursuit,\nthey moved with one step. Us, that, with laurelled heads, were passing from\nthe cathedral through its eastern gates, they overtook, and, as with a\ngarment, they wrapped us round with thunders that overpowered our own.\nAs brothers we moved together; to the skies we rose–to the dawn that\nadvanced–to the stars that fled; rendering thanks to God in the\nhighest–that, having hid his face through one generation behind thick\nclouds of War, once again was ascending–was ascending from Waterloo–in\nthe visions of Peace; rendering thanks for thee, young girl! whom having\novershadowed with his ineffable passion of death–suddenly did God relent;\nsuffered thy angel to turn aside his arm; and even in thee, sister unknown!\nshown to me for a moment only to be hidden for ever, found an occasion to\nglorify his goodness. A thousand times, amongst the phantoms of sleep, has\nhe shown thee to me, standing before the golden dawn, and ready to enter\nits gates–with the dreadful word going before thee–with the armies of the\ngrave behind thee; shown thee to me, sinking, rising, fluttering, fainting,\nbut then suddenly reconciled, adoring: a thousand times has he followed\nthee in the worlds of sleep–through storms; through desert seas; through\nthe darkness of quicksands; through fugues and the persecution of fugues;\nthrough dreams, and the dreadful resurrections that are in dreams–only\nthat at the last, with one motion of his victorious arm, he might record\nand emblazon the endless resurrections of his love!",
        "Great misconceptions have always prevailed about the Roman dinner.\nDinner [coena] was the only meal which the Romans as a nation took. It\nwas no accident, but arose out of their whole social economy. This we shall\nshow by running through the history of a Roman day. Ridentem dicere, verum\nquid vetat? And the course of this review will expose one or two important\ntruths in ancient political economy, which have been wholly overlooked.",
        "With the lark it was that the Roman rose. Not that the earliest lark rises\nso early in Latium as the earliest lark in England; that is, during summer:\nbut then, on the other hand, neither does it ever rise so late. The Roman\ncitizen was stirring with the dawn–which, allowing for the shorter\nlongest-day and longer shortest-day of Rome, you may call about four in\nsummer–about seven in winter. Why did he do this? Because he went to bed\nat a very early hour. But why did he do that? By backing in this way, we\nshall surely back into the very well of truth: always, if it is possible,\nlet us have the pourquoi of the pourquoi. The Roman went to bed early\nfor two special reasons. 1st, Because in Rome, which had been built for a\nmartial destiny, every habit of life had reference to the usages of war.\nEvery citizen, if he were not a mere proletarian animal kept at the public\ncost, held himself a sort of soldier-elect: the more noble he was, the\nmore was his liability to military service: in short, all Rome, and at all\ntimes, was consciously “in procinct.\"[1] Now it was a principle of ancient\nwarfare, that every hour of daylight had a triple worth, if valued\nagainst hours of darkness. That was one reason–a reason suggested by the\nunderstanding. But there was a second reason, far more remarkable; and this\nwas a reason dictated by a blind necessity. It is an important fact, that\nthis planet on which we live, this little industrious earth of ours, has\ndeveloped her wealth by slow stages of increase. She was far from being the\nrich little globe in Cæsar’s days that she is at present. The earth in our\ndays is incalculably richer, as a whole, than in the time of Charlemagne:\nat that time she was richer, by many a million of acres, than in the era\nof Augustus. In that Augustan era we descry a clear belt of cultivation,\naveraging about six hundred miles in depth, running in a ring-fence about\nthe Mediterranean. This belt, and no more, was in decent cultivation.\nBeyond that belt, there was only a wild Indian cultivation. At present\nwhat a difference! We have that very belt, but much richer, all things\nconsidered æquatis æquandis, than in the Roman era. The reader must not\nlook to single cases, as that of Egypt or other parts of Africa, but take\nthe whole collectively. On that scheme of valuation, we have the old Roman\nbelt, the Mediterranean riband not much tarnished, and we have all the\nrest of Europe to boot–or, speaking in scholar’s language, as a lucro\nponamus. We say nothing of remoter gains. Such being the case, our mother,\nthe earth, being (as a whole) so incomparably poorer, could not in the\nPagan era support the expense of maintaining great empires in cold\nlatitudes. Her purse would not reach that cost. Wherever she undertook in\nthose early ages to rear man in great abundance, it must be where nature\nwould consent to work in partnership with herself; where warmth was to\nbe had for nothing; where clothes were not so entirely indispensable but\nthat a ragged fellow might still keep himself warm; where slight sheltermight serve; and where the soil, if not absolutely richer in reversionary\nwealth, was more easily cultured. Nature must come forward liberally, and\ntake a number of shares in every new joint-stock concern before it could\nmove. Man, therefore, went to bed early in those ages, simply because his\nworthy mother earth could not afford him candles. She, good old lady, (or\ngood young lady, for geologists know not[2] whether she is in that stage\nof her progress which corresponds to gray hairs, or to infancy, or to “a\ncertain age,”)–she, good lady, would certainly have shuddered to hear\nany of her nations asking for candles. “Candles!” She would have said, “Who\never heard of such a thing? and with so much excellent daylight running to\nwaste, as I have provided gratis! What will the wretches want next?”",
        "The daylight, furnished gratis, was certainly “neat,” and “undeniable\"\nin its quality, and quite sufficient for all purposes that were honest.\nSeneca, even in his own luxurious period, called those men ’lucifugæ,\"\nand by other ugly names, who lived chiefly by candle-light. None but rich\nand luxurious men, nay, even amongst these, none but idlers did live much\nby candle-light. An immense majority of men in Rome never lighted a candle,\nunless sometimes in the early dawn. And this custom of Rome was the custom\nalso of all nations that lived round the great pond of the Mediterranean.\nIn Athens, Egypt, Palestine, Asia Minor, everywhere, the ancients went to\nbed, like good boys, from seven to nine o’clock.[3] The Turks and other\npeople, who have succeeded to the stations and the habits of the ancients,\ndo so at this day.",
        "The Roman, therefore, who saw no joke in sitting round a table in the dark,\nwent off to bed as the darkness began. Everybody did so. Old Numa Pompilius\nhimself, was obliged to trundle off in the dusk. Tarquinius might be a very\nsuperb fellow; but we doubt whether he ever saw a farthing rushlight. And,\nthough it may be thought that plots and conspiracies would flourish in\nsuch a city of darkness, it is to be considered, that the conspirators\nthemselves had no more candles than honest men: both parties were in the\ndark.",
        "Being up then, and stirring not long after the lark, what mischief did the\nRoman go about first? Now-a-days, he would have taken a pipe or a cigar.\nBut, alas for the ignorance of the poor heathen creatures! they had neither\none nor the other. In this point, we must tax our mother earth with\nbeing really too stingy. In the case of the candles, we approve of her\nparsimony. Much mischief is brewed by candle-light. But, it was coming it\ntoo strong to allow no tobacco. Many a wild fellow in Rome, your Gracchi,\nSyllas, Catilines, would not have played “h–– and Tommy” in the way they\ndid, if they could have soothed their angry stomachs with a cigar–a pipe\nhas intercepted many an evil scheme. But the thing is past helping now. At\nRome, you must do as “they does” at Rome. So, after shaving, (supposing the\nage of the Barbati to be passed), what is the first business that our\nRoman will undertake? Forty to one he is a poor man, born to look upwards\nto his fellow-men–and not to look down upon anybody but slaves. He goes,\ntherefore, to the palace of some grandee, some top-sawyer of the Senatorian\norder. This great man, for all his greatness, has turned out even sooner\nthan himself. For he also has had no candles and no cigars; and he well\nknows, that before the sun looks into his portals, all his halls will be\noverflowing and buzzing with the matin susurrus of courtiers–the “mane\nsalutantes.\"[4] it is as much as his popularity is worth to absent himself,\nor to keep people waiting. But surely, the reader may think, this poor man\nhe might keep waiting. No, he might not; for, though poor, being a citizen,\nhe is a gentleman. That was the consequence of keeping slaves. Wherever\nthere is a class of slaves, he that enjoys the jus suffragii (no\nmatter how poor) is a gentleman. The true Latin word for a gentleman is\ningentius–a freeman and the son of a freeman.",
        "Yet even here there were distinctions. Under the Emperors, the courtiers\nwere divided into two classes: with respect to the superior class, it was\nsaid of the sovereign–that he saw them, (videbat;) with respect to the\nother–that he was seen, (\"videbatur.”) Even Plutarch mentions it as\na common boast in his times, [Greek: aemas eiden ho basileus]–Cæsar is\nin the habit of seeing me; or, as a common plea for evading a suit,\n[Greek: ora mallon]–I am sorry to say he is more inclined to look upon\nothers. And this usage derived itself (mark that well!) from the\nrepublican era. The aulic spirit was propagated by the Empire, but from\na republican root.",
        "Having paid his court, you will suppose that our friend comes home to\nbreakfast. Not at all: no such discovery as “breakfast” had then been made:\nbreakfast was not invented for many centuries after that. We have always\nadmired, and always shall admire, as the very best of all human stories,\nCharles Lamb’s account of the origin of roast pig in China. Ching Ping,\nit seems, had suffered his father’s house to be burned down; the outhouses\nwere burned along with the house; and in one of these the pigs, by\naccident, were roasted to a turn. Memorable were the results for all future\nChina and future civilization. Ping, who (like all China beside) had\nhitherto eaten his pig raw, now for the first time tasted it in a state\nof torrefaction. Of course he made his peace with his father by a part\n(tradition says a leg) of the new dish. The father was so astounded with\nthe discovery, that he burned his house down once a year for the sake of\ncoming at an annual banquet of roast pig. A curious prying sort of fellow,\none Chang Pang, got to know of this. He also burned down a house with a\npig in it, and had his eyes opened. The secret was ill kept–the discovery\nspread–many great conversions were made–houses were blazing in every part\nof the Celestial Empire. The insurance offices took the matter up.\nOne Chong Pong, detected in the very act of shutting up a pig in his\ndrawing-room, and then firing a train, was indicted on a charge of arson.\nThe chief justice of Pekin, on that occasion, requested an officer of the\ncourt to hand him a piece of the roast pig, the corpus delicti, for pure\ncuriosity led him to taste; but within two days after it was observed that\nhis lordship’s town-house was burned down. In short, all China apostatized\nto the new faith; and it was not until some centuries had passed, that a\ngreat genius arose, who established the second era in the history of roast\npig, by showing that it could be had without burning down a house.",
        "No such genius had yet arisen in Rome. Breakfast was not suspected. No\nprophecy, no type of breakfast had been published. In fact, it took as much\ntime and research to arrive at that great discovery as at the Copernican\nsystem. True it is, reader, that you have heard of such a word as\njentaculum; and your dictionary translates that old heathen word by\nthe Christian word breakfast. But dictionaries, one and all, are dull\ndeceivers. Between jentaculum and breakfast the differences are as wide\nas between a horse-chestnut and chestnut horse; differences in the time\nwhen, in the place where, in the manner how, but preeminently in the\nthing which.",
        "Galen is a good authority upon such a subject, since, if (like other\npagans) he ate no breakfast himself, in some sense he may be called the\ncause of breakfast to other men, by treating of those things which could\nsafely be taken upon an empty stomach. As to the time, he (like many other\nauthors) says, [peri tritaen, ae (to makroteron) peri tetartaen,]\nabout the third, or at farthest about the fourth hour: and so exact is he,\nthat he assumes the day to lie exactly between six and six o’clock, and to\nbe divided into thirteen equal portions. So the time will be a few minutes\nbefore nine, or a few minutes before ten, in the forenoon. That seems fair\nenough. But it is not time in respect to its location that we are so\nmuch concerned with, as time in respect to its duration. Now, heaps of\nauthorities take it for granted, that you are not to sit down–you are to\nstand; and, as to the place, that any place will do–\"any corner of the\nforum,” says Galen, “any corner that you fancy;” which is like referring a\nman for his salle à manger to Westminster Hall or Fleet Street. Augustus,\nin a letter still surviving, tells us that he jentabat, or took his\njentaculum in his carriage; now in a wheel carriage, (in essedo,) now\nin a litter or palanquin (in lecticâ.) This careless and disorderly\nway as to time and place, and other circumstances of haste, sufficiently\nindicate the quality of the meal you are to expect. Already you are\n\"sagacious of your quarry from so far.” Not that we would presume,\nexcellent reader, to liken you to Death, or to insinuate that you are\n\"a grim feature.” But would it not make a saint “grim,” to hear of such\npreparations for the morning meal? And then to hear of such consummations\nas panis siccus, dry bread; or, (if the learned reader thinks it will\ntaste better in Greek,) [Greek: artos xaeros!] And what may this word\ndry happen to mean? “Does it mean stale bread?” says Salmasius. “Shall\nwe suppose,” says he, in querulous words, ’molli et recenti opponi,” and\nfrom that antithesis conclude it to be, ’durum et non recens coctum, eoque\nsicciorem?” Hard and stale, and for that reason the more arid! Not quite\nso bad as that, we hope. Or again–\"siccum pro biscocto, ut hodie vocamus,\nsumemus?\"[5] By hodie Salmasius means, amongst his countrymen of France,\nwhere biscoctus is verbatim reproduced in the word bis (twice) cuit,\n(baked;) whence our own biscuit. Biscuit might do very well, could we be\nsure that it was cabin biscuit: but Salmasius argues–that in this case he\ntakes it to mean ’buccellatum, qui est panis nauticus;” that is, the ship\ncompany’s biscuit, broken with a sledge-hammer. In Greek, for the benefit\nagain of the learned reader, it is termed [Greek: dipuros], indicating\nthat it has passed twice under the action of fire.",
        "“Well,” you say, “No matter if it had passed fifty times–and through the\nfires of Moloch; only let us have this biscuit, such as it is.” In good\nfaith, then, fasting reader, you are not likely to see much more than you\nhave seen. It is a very Barmecide feast, we do assure you–this same\n\"jentaculum;” at which abstinence and patience are much more exercised than\nthe teeth: faith and hope are the chief graces cultivated, together with\nthat species of the magnificum which is founded on the ignotum. Even\nthis biscuit was allowed in the most limited quantities; for which reason\nit is that the Greeks called this apology for a a meal by the name\nof [Greek: bouchismos], a word formed (as many words were in the\nPost-Augustan ages) from a Latin word–viz., buccea, a mouthful; not\nliterally such, but so much as a polished man could allow himself to put\ninto his mouth at once. “We took a mouthful,” says Sir William Waller, the\nParliamentary general, “took a mouthful; paid our reckoning; mounted;\nand were off.” But there Sir William means, by his plausible “mouthful,\"\nsomething very much beyond either nine or nineteen ordinary quantities of\nthat denomination, whereas the Roman “jentaculum” was literally such; and,\naccordingly, one of the varieties under which the ancient vocabularies\nexpress this model of evanescent quantities is gustatio, a mere tasting;\nand again it is called by another variety, gustus, a mere taste: [whence\nby the usual suppression of the s, comes the French word for a collation\nor luncheon, viz. gouter] Speaking of his uncle, Pliny the Younger\nsays–\"Post solem plerumque lavabatur; deinde gustabat; dormiebat minimum;\nmox, quasi alio die, studebat in coenæ tempus”. “After taking the air he\nbathed; after that he broke his fast on a bit of biscuit, and took a\nvery slight siesta: which done, as if awaking to a new day, he set in\nregularly to his studies, and pursued them to dinner-time.” Gustabathere meant that nondescript meal which arose at Rome when jentaculum and\nprandium were fused into one, and that only a taste or mouthful of\nbiscuit, as we shall show farther on.",
        "Possibly, however, most excellent reader, like some epicurean traveller,\nwho, in crossing the Alps, finds himself weather-bound at St. Bernard’s\non Ash-Wednesday, you surmise a remedy: you descry some opening from “the\nloopholes of retreat,” through which a few delicacies might be insinuated\nto spread verdure on this arid desert of biscuit. Casuistry can do much. A\ndead hand at casuistry has often proved more than a match for Lent with all\nhis quarantines. But sorry we are to say that, in this case, no relief is\nhinted at in any ancient author. A grape or two, (not a bunch of grapes,)\na raisin or two, a date, an olive–these are the whole amount of relief[6]\nwhich the chancery of the Roman kitchen granted in such cases. All things\nhere hang together, and prove each other; the time, the place, the mode,\nthe thing. Well might man eat standing, or eat in public, such a trifle\nas this. Go home to such a breakfast as this! You would as soon think of\nordering a cloth to be laid in order to eat a peach, or of asking a friend\nto join you in an orange. No man makes “two bites of a cherry.” So let\nus pass on to the other stages of the day. Only in taking leave of this\nmorning stage, throw your eyes back with us, Christian reader, upon this\ntruly heathen meal, fit for idolatrous dogs like your Greeks and your\nRomans; survey, through the vista of ages, that thrice-cursed biscuit, with\nhalf a fig, perhaps, by way of garnish, and a huge hammer by its side, to\nsecure the certainty of mastication, by previous comminution. Then turn\nyour eyes to a Christian breakfast–hot rolls, eggs, coffee, beef; but\ndown, down, rebellious visions: we need say no more! You, reader, like\nourselves, will breathe a malediction on the classical era, and thank your\nstars for making you a Romanticist. Every morning we thank ours for keeping\nus back, and reserving us to an age in which breakfast had been already\ninvented. In the words of Ovid we say:–",
        "“Prisca juvent alios: ego me nunc denique natum Gratulor. Hæc ætas moribus\napta meis.”",
        "Our friend, the Roman cit, has therefore thus far, in his progress through\nlife, obtained no breakfast, if he ever contemplated an idea so frantic.\nBut it occurs to you, our faithful reader, that perhaps he will not always\nbe thus unhappy. We could bring waggon-loads of sentiments, Greek as well\nas Roman, which prove, more clearly than the most eminent pikestaff, that,\nas the wheel of fortune revolves, simply out of the fact that it has\ncarried a man downwards, it must subsequently carry him upwards, no matter\nwhat dislike that wheel, or any of its spokes, may bear to that man: “non,\nsi male nunc sit, et olim sic erit:” and that if a man, through the madness\nof his nation, misses coffee and hot rolls at nine, he may easily run into\na leg of mutton at twelve. True it is he may do so: truth is commendable;\nand we will not deny that a man may sometimes, by losing a breakfast, gain\na dinner. Such things have been in various ages, and will be again, but not\nat Rome. There are reasons against it. We have heard of men who consider\nlife under the idea of a wilderness–dry as “a remainder biscuit after a\nvoyage:” and who consider a day under the idea of a little life. Life\nis the macrocosm, or world at large; day is the microcosm, or world in\nminiature. Consequently, if life is a wilderness, then day, as a little\nlife, is a little wilderness. And this wilderness can be safely traversed\nonly by having relays of fountains, or stages for refreshment. Such\nstages, they conceive, are found in the several meals which Providence has\nstationed at due intervals through the day, whenever the perverseness of\nman does not break the chain, or derange the order of succession.",
        "These are the anchors by which man rides in that billowy ocean between\nmorning and night. The first anchor, viz., breakfast, having given way in\nRome, the more need there is that he should pull up by the second; and\nthat is often reputed to be dinner. And as your dictionary, good reader,\ntranslated breakfast by that vain word jentaculum, so, doubtless, it\nwill translate dinner by that still vainer word prandium. Sincerely we\nhope that your own dinner on this day, and through all time coming, may\nhave a better root in fact and substance than this most visionary of all\nbaseless things–the Roman prandium, of which we shall presently show you\nthat the most approved translation is moonshine.",
        "Reader, we are not jesting here. In the very spirit of serious truth, we\nassure you, that the delusion about “jentaculum” is even exceeded by this\nother delusion about “prandium.” Salmasius himself, for whom a natural\nprejudice of place and time partially obscured the truth, admits, however,\nthat prandium was a meal which the ancients rarely took; his very words\nare–\"raro prandebant veteres.” Now, judge for yourself of the good sense\nwhich is shown in translating by the word dinner, which must of necessity\nmean the chief meal–a Roman word which represents a fancy meal, a meal of\ncaprice, a meal which few people took. At this moment, what is the single\npoint of agreement between the noon meal of the English laborer and the\nevening meal of the English gentleman? What is the single circumstance\ncommon to both, which causes us to denominate them by the common name of\ndinner? It is that in both we recognize the principal meal of the\nday, the meal upon which is thrown the onus of the day’s support. In\neverything else they are as wide asunder as the poles; but they agree in\nthis one point of their function. Is it credible that, to represent such a\nmeal amongst ourselves, we select a Roman word so notoriously expressing a\nmere shadow, a pure apology, that very few people ever tasted it–nobody\nsate down to it–not many washed their hands after it, and gradually the\nvery name of it became interchangeable with another name, implying the\nslightest possible act of trying or sipping? ’Post larationem sine mensâ\nprandium,” says Seneca, ’post quod non sunt lavandæ manus;” that is,\n\"after bathing, I take a prandium without sitting down to table, and such\na prandium as brings after itself no need of washing the hands.” No;\nmoonshine as little soils the hands as it oppresses the stomach.",
        "Reader! we, as well as Pliny, had an uncle, an East Indian uncle; doubtless\nyou have such an uncle; everybody has an Indian uncle. Generally such a\nperson is “rather yellow, rather yellow,” [to quote Canning versus Lord\nDurham:] that is the chief fault with his physics; but, as to his morals,\nhe is universally a man of princely aspirations and habits. He is not\nalways so orientally rich as he is reputed; but he is always orientally\nmunificent. Call upon him at any hour from two to five, he insists on your\ntaking tiffin: and such a tiffin! The English corresponding term is\nluncheon: but how meagre a shadow is the European meal to its glowing\nAsiatic cousin! Still, gloriously as tiffin shines, does anybody imagine\nthat it is a vicarious dinner, or ever meant to be the substitute of\ndinner? Wait till eight, and you will have your eyes opened on that\nsubject. So of the Roman prandium: had it been as luxurious as it was\nsimple, still it was always viewed as something meant only to stay the\nstomach, as a prologue to something beyond. The prandium was far enough\nfrom giving the feeblest idea of the English luncheon; yet it stood in the\nsame relation to the Roman day. Now to Englishmen that meal scarcely\nexists; and were it not for women, whose delicacy of organization does\nnot allow them to fast so long as men, would probably be abolished. It is\nsingular in this, as in other points, how nearly England and ancient Rome\napproximate. We all know how hard it is to tempt a man generally into\nspoiling his appetite, by eating before dinner. The same dislike of\nviolating what they called the integrity of the appetite, [integram\nfamem,] existed at Rome. Every man who knows anything of Latin critically,\nsees the connection of the word integer with in and tetigi: integermeans what is intact, unviolated by touch. Cicero, when protesting\nagainst spoiling his appetite for dinner, by tasting anything beforehand,\nsays, integram famem ad coenam afferam; I shall bring to dinner an\nappetite untampered with. Nay, so much stress did the Romans lay on\nmaintaining this primitive state of the appetite undisturbed, that any\nprelusions with either jentaculum or prandium were said, by a very\nstrong phrase indeed, polluere famem, to pollute the sanctity of the\nappetite. The appetite was regarded as a holy vestal flame, soaring upwards\ntowards dinner throughout the day: if undebauched, it tended to its natural\nconsummation in coena: expired like a phoenix, to rise again out of its\nown ashes. On this theory, to which language had accommodated itself, the\ntwo prelusive meals of nine o’clock, A.M., and of one, P.M., so far from\nbeing ratified by the public sense, and adopted into the economy of the\nday, were regarded gloomily as gross irregularities, enormities, debauchers\nof the natural instinct; and, in so far as they thwarted that instinct,\nlessened it, or depraved it, were universally held to be full of pollution;\nand, finally, to profane a motion of nature. Such was the language.",
        "But we guess what is passing in the reader’s mind. He thinks that all this\nproves the prandium to have been a meal of little account; and in very\nmany cases absolutely unknown. But still he thinks all this might happen to\nthe English dinner–that might be neglected; supper might be generally\npreferred; and, nevertheless, dinner would be as truly entitled to the name\nof dinner as before. Many a student neglects his dinner; enthusiasm in any\npursuit must often have extinguished appetite for all of us. Many a time\nand oft did this happen to Sir Isaac Newton. Evidence is on record, that\nsuch a deponent at eight o’clock, A.M., found Sir Isaac with one stocking\non, one off; at two, said deponent called him to dinner. Being interrogated\nwhether Sir Isaac had pulled on the minus stocking, or gartered the\nplus stocking, witness replied that he had not. Being asked if Sir Isaac\ncame to dinner, replied that he did not. Being again asked, “At sunset, did\nyou look in on Sir Isaac?” Witness replied, “I did.” “And now, upon your\nconscience, sir, by the virtue of your oath, in what state were the\nstockings?” Ans. “In statu quo ante bellum.” It seems Sir Isaac had\nfought through that whole battle of a long day, so trying a campaign to\nmany people–be had traversed that whole sandy Zaarah, without calling, or\nneeding to call at one of those fountains, stages, or mansiones,[7] by\nwhich (according to our former explanation) Providence has relieved the\ncontinuity of arid soil, which else disfigures that long dreary level. This\nhappens to all; but was dinner not dinner, and did supper become dinner,\nbecause Sir Isaac Newton ate nothing at the first, and threw the whole\nday’s support upon the last? No, you will say, a rule is not defeated by\none casual deviation, nor by one person’s constant deviation. Everybody\nelse was still dining at two, though Sir Isaac might not; and Sir Isaac\nhimself on most days no more deferred his dinner beyond two, than he sate\nwith one stocking off. But what if everybody, Sir Isaac included, had\ndeferred his substantial meal until night, and taken a slight refection\nonly at two? The question put does really represent the very case which has\nhappened with us in England. In 1700, a large part of London took a meal\nat two, P.M., and another at seven or eight, P.M. In 1839, a large part\nof London is still doing the very same thing, taking one meal at two, and\nanother at seven or eight. But the names are entirely changed: the two\no’clock meal used to be called dinner, and is now called luncheon; the\neight o’clock meal used to be called supper, and is now called dinner.",
        "Now the question is easily solved: because, upon reviewing the idea of\ndinner, we soon perceive that time has little or no connection with it:\nsince, both in England and France, dinner has travelled, like the hand of a\nclock, through every hour between ten, A.M. and ten, P.M. We have a list,\nwell attested, of every successive hour between these limits having been\nthe known established hour for the royal dinner-table within the last three\nhundred and fifty years. Time, therefore, vanishes from the equation: it is\na quantity as regularly exterminated as in any algebraic problem. The true\nelements of the idea, are evidently these:–1. That dinner is that meal, no\nmatter when taken, which is the principal meal; i.e. the meal on which\nthe day’s support is thrown. 2. That it is the meal of hospitality. 3. That\nit is the meal (with reference to both Nos 1 and 2) in which animal food\npredominates. 4. That it is that meal which, upon necessity arising for the\nabolition of all but one, would naturally offer itself as that one. Apply\nthese four tests to prandium:–How could that meal answer to the first\ntest, as the day’s support, which few people touched? How could that meal\nanswer to the second test, as the meal of hospitality, at which nobody\nsate down? How could that meal answer to the third test, as the meal of\nanimal food, which consisted exclusively and notoriously of bread? Or to\nthe fourth test, of the meal entitled to survive the abolition of the\nrest, which was itself abolished at all times in practice?",
        "Tried, therefore, by every test, prandium vanishes. But we have something\nfurther to communicate about this same prandium.",
        "I. It came to pass, by a very natural association of feeling, that\nprandium and jentuculum, in the latter centuries of Rome, were\ngenerally confounded. This result was inevitable. Both professed the\nsame basis Both came in the morning. Both were fictions. Hence they were\nconfounded.",
        "That fact speaks for itself,–breakfast and luncheon never could have been\nconfounded; but who would be at the pains of distinguishing two shadows? In\na gambling-house of that class, where you are at liberty to sit down to a\nsplendid banquet, anxiety probably prevents your sitting down at all; but,\nif you do, the same cause prevents your noticing what you eat. So of the\ntwo pseudo meals of Rome, they came in the very midst of the Roman\nbusiness; viz. from nine, A.M. to two, P.M. Nobody could give his mind\nto them, had they been of better quality. There lay one cause of their\nvagueness, viz.–in their position. Another cause was, the common basis of\nboth. Bread was so notoriously the predominating “feature” in each of these\nprelusive banquets, that all foreigners at Rome, who communicated with\nRomans through the Greek language, knew both the one and the other by the\nname of [Greek: artositos], or the bread repast. Originally this name\nhad been restricted to the earlier meal. But a distinction without a\ndifference could not sustain itself: and both alike disguised their\nemptiness under this pompous quadrisyllable. In the identity of substance,\ntherefore, lay a second ground of confusion. And, then, thirdly, even as\nto the time, which had ever been the sole real distinction, there arose\nfrom accident a tendency to converge. For it happened that while some had\njentaculum but no prandium, others had prandium but no jentaculum;\na third party had both; a fourth party, by much the largest, had neither.\nOut of which varieties (who would think that a nonentity could cut up\ninto so many somethings?) arose a fifth party of compromisers, who,\nbecause they could not afford a regular coena, and yet were\nhospitably disposed, fused the two ideas into one; and so, because the\nusual time for the idea of a breakfast was nine to ten, and for the idea\nof a luncheon twelve to one, compromised the rival pretensions by what\ndiplomatists call a mezzo termine; bisecting the time at eleven, and\nmelting the two ideas into one. But by thus merging the separate times\nof each, they abolished the sole real difference that had ever divided\nthem. Losing that, they lost all.",
        "Perhaps, as two negatives make one affirmative, it may be thought that two\nlayers of moonshine might coalesce into one pancake; and two Barmecide\nbanquets might compose one poached egg. Of that the company were the best\njudges. But probably, as a rump and dozen, in our land of wagers, is\nconstrued with a very liberal latitude as to the materials, so Martial’s\ninvitation, “to take bread with him at eleven,” might be understood by the\n[Greek: sunetoi] as significant of something better than\n[Greek: artositos]. Otherwise, in good truth, “moonshine and turn-out\"\nat eleven, A.M., would be even worse than “tea and turn-out” at eight,\nP.M., which the “fervida juventus” of young England so loudly detests. But\nhowever that might be, in this convergement of the several frontiers, and\nthe confusion that ensued, one cannot wonder that, whilst the two bladders\ncollapsed into one idea, they actually expanded into four names, two Latin\nand two Greek, gustus and gustatio, [Greek: geusis], and\n[Greek: geusma], which all alike express the merely tentative or\nexploratory act of a prægustator or professional “taster” in a\nking’s household: what, if applied to a fluid, we should denominate\nsipping.",
        "At last, by so many steps all in one direction, things had come to such\na pass–the two prelusive meals of the Roman morning, each for itself\nseparately vague from the beginning, had so communicated and interfused\ntheir several and joint vaguenesses, that at last no man knew or cared to\nknow what any other man included in his idea of either; how much or how\nlittle. And you might as well have hunted in the woods of Ethiopia for\nPrester John, or fixed the parish of the everlasting Jew,[8] as have\nattempted to say what “jentaculum” might be, or what “prandium.” Only one\nthing was clear–what they were not. Neither was or wished to be anything\nthat people cared for. They were both empty shadows; but shadows as they\nwere, we find from Cicero that they had a power of polluting and profaning\nbetter things than themselves.",
        "We presume that no rational man will henceforth look for “dinner\"–that\ngreat idea according to Dr. Johnson–that sacred idea according to\nCicero–in a bag of moonshine on one side, or a bag of pollution on\nthe other. Prandium, so far from being what our foolish dictionaries\npretend–dinner itself–never in its palmiest days was more or other than\na miserable attempt at being luncheon. It was a conatus, what\nphysiologists call a nisus, a struggle in a very ambitious spark,\nor scintilla, to kindle into a fire. This nisus went on for some\ncenturies; but finally issued in smoke. If prandium had worked out his\nambition, had “the great stream of tendency” accomplished all his wishes,\nprandium never could have been more than a very indifferent luncheon. But\nnow,",
        "II. We have to offer another fact, ruinous to our dictionaries on another\nground. Various circumstances have disguised the truth, but a truth it is,\nthat “prandium”, in its very origin and incunabula, never was a meal\nknown to the Roman culina. In that court it was never recognized except\nas an alien. It had no original domicile in the city of Rome. It was a vot\ncasfren-sis, a word and an idea purely martial, and pointing to martial\nnecessities. Amongst the new ideas proclaimed to the recruit, this was\none–\"Look for no ’coenu’, no regular dinner, with us. Resign these\nunwarlike notions. It is true that even war has its respites; in these\nit would be possible to have our Roman coena with all its equipage of\nministrations. Such luxury untunes the mind for doing and suffering. Let us\nvoluntarily renounce it; that when a necessity of renouncing it arrives, we\nmay not feel it among the hardships of war. From the day when you enter the\ngates of the camp, reconcile yourself, tyro, to a new fashion of meal, to\nwhat in camp dialect we call prandium.” This “prandium,” this essentially\nmilitary meal, was taken standing, by way of symbolizing the necessity of\nbeing always ready for the enemy. Hence the posture in which it was taken\nat Rome, the very counter-pole to the luxurious posture of dinner. A writer\nof the third century, a period from which the Romans naturally looked back\nupon everything connected with their own early habits, and with the same\nkind of interest as we extend to our Alfred, (separated from us as Romulus\nfrom them by just a thousand years,) in speaking of prandium, says, “Quod\ndictum est parandium, ab eo quod milites ad bellum paret.” Isidorus\nagain says, “Proprie apud veteres prandium vocatum fuisse oinnem militum\ncibum ante pugnam;” i.e. “that, properly speaking, amongst our ancestors\nevery military meal taken before battle was termed prandium.” According\nto Isidore, the proposition is reciprocating, viz., that, as every\nprandium was a military meal, so every military meal was called\nprandium. But, in fact, the reason of that is apparent. Whether in the\ncamp or the city, the early Romans had probably but one meal in a day. That\nis true of many a man amongst ourselves by choice; it is true also, to our\nknowledge, of some horse regiments in our service, and may be of all. This\nmeal was called coena, or dinner in the city–prandium in camps. In the\ncity it would always be tending to one fixed hour. In the camp innumerable\naccidents of war would make it very uncertain. On this account it would\nbe an established rule to celebrate the daily meal at noon, if nothing\nhindered; not that a later hour would not have been preferred had the\nchoice been free; but it was better to have a certainty at a bad hour, than\nby waiting for a better hour to make it an uncertainty. For it was a camp\nproverb–Pransus, paratus; armed with his daily meal, the soldier\nis ready for service. It was not, however, that all meals, as Isidore\nimagined, were indiscriminately called prandium; but that the one sole\nmeal of the day, by accidents of war, might, and did, revolve through all\nhours of the day.",
        "The first introduction of this military meal into Rome itself, would be\nthrough the honorable pedantry of old centurions, &c., delighting (like the\nTrunnions, &c., of our navy) to keep up in peaceful life some image or\nmemorial of their past experience, so wild, so full of peril, excitement,\nand romance, as Roman warfare must have been in those ages. Many\nnon-military people for health’s sake, many as an excuse for eating early,\nmany by way of interposing some refreshment between the stages of forensic\nbusiness, would adopt this hurried and informal meal. Many would wish to\nsee their sons adopting such a meal as a training for foreign service in\nparticular, and for temperance in general. It would also be maintained by a\nsolemn and very interesting commemoration of this camp repast in Rome.",
        "This commemoration, because it has been grossly misunderstood by Salmasius,\n(whose error arose from not marking the true point of a particular\nantithesis,) and still more, because it is a distinct confirmation of all\nwe have said as to the military nature of prandium, we shall detach from\nthe series of our illustrations, by placing it in a separate paragraph.",
        "On a set day the officers of the army were invited by Cæsar to a banquet;\nit was a circumstance expressly noticed in the invitation, by the proper\nofficers of the palace, that the banquet was not a “coena,” but a\n\"prandium.” What followed, in consequence? Why, that all the guests sate\ndown in full military accoutrement; whereas, observes the historian, had it\nbeen a coena, the officers would have unbelted their swords; for, he adds,\neven in Cæsar’s presence the officers lay aside their swords. The word\nprandium, in short, converted the palace into the imperial tent; and\nCæsar was no longer a civil emperor and princeps senatûs, but became a\ncommander-in-chief amongst a council of his staff, all belted and plumed,\nand in full military fig.",
        "On this principle we come to understand why it is, that, whenever the Latin\npoets speak of an army as taking food, the word used is always prandensand pransus; and, when the word used is prandens, then always it is an\narmy that is concerned. Thus Juvenal in a well-known satire–",
        "  ––\"Credimus altos\n  Desiccasse amnes, epotaque ftumina, Medo Prandente.”",
        "Not coenante, observe: you might as well talk of an army taking tea\nand toast. Nor is that word ever applied to armies. It is true that the\nconverse is not so rigorously observed: nor ought it, from the explanations\nalready given. Though no soldier dined, (coenabat,) yet the citizen\nsometimes adopted the camp usage and took a prandium. But generally the\npoets use the word merely to mark the time of day. In that most humorous\nappeal of Perseus–\"Cur quis non prandeat, hoc est?” “Is this a sufficient\nreason for losing one’s prandium?” He was obliged to say prandium,\nbecause no exhibitions ever could cause a man to lose his coenia, since\nnone were displayed at a time of day when anybody in Rome would have\nattended. Just as, in alluding to a parliamentary speech notoriously\ndelivered at midnight, an English satirist must have said, Is this a speech\nto furnish an argument for leaving one’s bed?–not as what stood foremost\nin his regard, but as the only thing that could be lost at the time of\nnight.",
        "On this principle, also, viz. by going back to the military origin of\nprandium, we gain the interpretation of all the peculiarities attached to\nit; viz.–1, its early hour–2, its being taken in a standing posture–3,\nin the open air–4, the humble quality of its materials–bread and biscuit,\n(the main articles of military fare.) In all these circumstances of the\nmeal, we read, most legibly written, the exotic and military character of\nthe meal.",
        "Thus we have brought down our Roman friend to noonday, or even one hour\nlater than noon, and to this moment the poor man has had nothing to eat.\nFor, supposing him to be not impransus, and supposing him jentâssebeside; yet it is evident, (we hope,) that neither one nor the other means\nmore than what it was often called, viz. [Greek: Bouchismos], or, in\nplain English, a mouthful. How long do we intend to keep him waiting?\nReader, he will dine at three, or (supposing dinner put off to the latest)\nat four. Dinner was never known to be later than the tenth hour in Rome,\nwhich in summer would be past five; but for a far greater proportion of\ndays would be near four in Rome, except for one or two of the emperors,\nwhom the mere business attached to their unhappy station kept sometimes\ndinnerless till six. And so entirely was a Roman the creature of ceremony,\nthat a national mourning would probably have been celebrated, and the “sad\naugurs” would have been called in to expiate the prodigy, had the general\ndinner lingered beyond four.",
        "But, meantime, what has our friend been about since perhaps six or seven in\nthe morning? After paying his little homage to his patronus, in what\nway has he fought with the great enemy Time since then? Why, reader, this\nillustrates one of the most interesting features in the Roman character.\nThe Roman was the idlest of men. “Man and boy,” he was “an idler in the\nland.” He called himself and his pals “rerum dominos, gentemque togatam;\"\nthe gentry that wore the toga. Yes, and a pretty affair that “toga” was.\nJust figure to yourself, reader, the picture of a hardworking man, with\nhorny hands like our hedgers, ditchers, weavers, porters, &c., setting to\nwork on the highroad in that vast sweeping toga, filling with a strong\ngale like the mainsail of a frigate. Conceive the roars with which this\nmagnificent figure would be received into the bosom of a poor-house\ndetachment sent out to attack the stones on some new line of road, or a\nfatigue party of dustmen sent upon secret service. Had there been nothing\nleft as a memorial of the Romans but that one relic–their immeasurable\ntoga,[9]–we should have known that they were born and bred to idleness. In\nfact, except in war, the Roman never did anything at all but sun himself.\nUt se apricaret was the final cause of peace in his opinion; in literal\ntruth, that he might make an apricot of himself. The public rations at\nall times supported the poorest inhabitant of Rome if he were a citizen.\nHence it was that Hadrian was so astonished with the spectacle of\nAlexandria, ’civitas opulenta, fæcunda, in qua nemo vivat otiosus.” Here\nfirst he saw the spectacle of a vast city, second only to Rome, where every\nman had something to do; ’podagrosi quod agant habent; habent cæci quod\nfaciant; ne chiragrici” (those with gout in the fingers) ’apud eos otiosi\nvivunt.” No poor rates levied upon the rest of the world for the benefit\nof their own paupers were there distributed gratis. The prodigious\nspectacle (so it seemed to Hadrian) was exhibited in Alexandria, of all men\nearning their bread in the sweat of their brow. In Rome only, (and at one\ntime in some of the Grecian states,) it was the very meaning of citizenthat he could vote and be idle.",
        "In these circumstances, where the whole sum of life’s duties amounted\nto voting, all the business a man could have was to attend the public\nassemblies, electioneering, or factious. These, and any judicial trial\n(public or private) that might happen to interest him for the persons\nconcerned, or for the questions, amused him through the morning; that\nis, from eight till one. He might also extract some diversion from\nthe columnæ, or pillars of certain porticoes to which they pasted\nadvertisements. These affiches must have been numerous; for all the girls\nin Rome who lost a trinket, or a pet bird, or a lap-dog, took this mode of\nangling in the great ocean of the public for the missing articles.",
        "But all this time we take for granted that there were no shows in a course\nof exhibition, either the dreadful ones of the amphitheatre, or the\nbloodless ones of the circus. If there were, then that became the business\nof all Romans; and it was a business which would have occupied him from\ndaylight until the light began to fail. Here we see another effect from the\nscarcity of artificial light amongst the ancients. These magnificent shows\nwent on by daylight. But how incomparably greater would have been the\nsplendor by lamp-light! What a gigantic conception! Eighty thousand human\nfaces all revealed under one blaze of lamp-light! Lord Bacon saw the mighty\nadvantage of candle-light for the pomps and glories of this world. But the\npoverty of the earth was the ultimate cause that the Pagan shows proceeded\nby day. Not that the masters of the world, who rained Arabian odors and\nperfumed waters of the most costly description from a thousand fountains,\nsimply to cool the summer heats, would have regarded the expense of light;\ncedar and other odorous woods burning upon vast altars, together with every\nvariety of fragrant torch, would have created light enough to shed a new\nday over the distant Adriatic.",
        "However, as there are no public spectacles, we will suppose, and the courts\nor political meetings, (if not closed altogether by superstition,) would at\nany rate be closed in the ordinary course by twelve or one o’clock, nothing\nremains for him to do, before returning home, except perhaps to attend the\npalæstra, or some public recitation of a poem written by a friend, but in\nany case to attend the public baths. For these the time varied; and many\npeople have thought it tyrannical in some of the Cæsars that they imposed\nrestraints on the time open for the baths; some, for instance, would not\nsuffer them to open at all before two, and in any case, if you were later\nthan four or five in summer, you would have to pay a fine which most\neffectually cleaned out the baths of all raff, since it was a sum that\nJohn Quires could not have produced to save his life. But it should be\nconsidered that the emperor was the steward of the public resources for\nmaintaining the baths in fuel, oil, attendance, repairs. We are prepared\nto show, on a fitting occasion, that every fourth person[10] amongst the\ncitizens bathed daily, and non-citizens, of course, paid an extra sum.\nNow the population of Rome was far larger than has ever been hinted at\nexcept by Lipsius. But certain it is, that during the long peace of the\nfirst Cæsars, and after the annonaria prorisio, (that great pledge of\npopularity to a Roman prince,) had been increased by the corn tribute from\nthe Nile, the Roman population took an immense lurch ahead. The subsequent\nincrease of baths, whilst no old ones were neglected, proves thatdecisively. And as citizenship expanded by means of the easy terms on which\nit could be had, so did the bathers multiply. The population of Rome in the\ncentury after Augustus, was far greater than during that era; and this,\nstill acting as a vortex to the rest of the world, may have been one great\nmotive with Constantine for “transferring” the capital eastwards; in\nreality, for breaking up one monster capital into two of more manageable\ndimensions. Two o’clock was often the earliest hour at which the public\nbaths were opened. But in Martial’s time a man could go without blushing\n(salvâ fronte) at eleven, though even then two o’clock was the meridian\nhour for the great uproar of splashing, and swimming, and “larking” in the\nendless baths of endless Rome.",
        "And now, at last, bathing finished, and the exercises of the palæstra, at\nhalf-past two, or three, our friend finds his way home–not again to leave\nit for that day. He is now a new man; refreshed, oiled with perfumes, his\ndust washed off by hot water, and ready for enjoyment. These were the\nthings that determined the time for dinner. Had there been no other proof\nthat coena was the Roman dinner, this is an ample one. Now first the\nRoman was fit for dinner, in a condition of luxurious ease; business\never–that day’s load of anxiety laid aside–his cuticle, as he delighted\nto talk, cleansed and polished–nothing more to do or to think of until\nthe next morning, he might now go and dine, and get drunk with a safe\nconscience. Besides, if he does not get dinner now, when will he get it?\nFor most demonstrably he has taken nothing yet which comes near in value\nto that basin of soup which many of ourselves take at the Roman hour of\nbathing. No; we have kept our man fasting as yet. It is to be hoped that\nsomething is coming at last.",
        "It does come,–dinner, the great meal of “coena;” the meal sacred to\nhospitality and genial pleasure, comes now to fill up the rest of the day,\nuntil light fails altogether.",
        "Many people are of opinion that the Romans only understood what the\ncapabilities of dinner were. It is certain that they were the first great\npeople that discovered the true secret and meaning of dinner, the great\noffice which it fulfils, and which we in England are now so generally\nacting on. Barbarous nations,–and none were, in that respect, more\nbarbarous than our own ancestors,–made this capital blunder; the brutes,\nif you asked them what was the use of dinner, what it was meant for, stared\nat you and replied–as a horse would reply if you put the same question\nabout his provender–that it was to give him strength for finishing his\nwork! Therefore, if you point your telescope back to antiquity about twelve\nor one o’clock in the daytime, you will descry our most worthy ancestors\nall eating for their very lives, eating as dogs eat, viz. in bodily fear\nthat some other dog will come and take their dinner away. What swelling of\nthe veins in the temples! (see Boswell’s natural history of Dr. Johnson at\ndinner;) what intense and rapid deglutition! what odious clatter of knives\nand plates! what silence of the human voice! what gravity! what fury in the\nlibidinous eyes with which they contemplate the dishes! Positively it was\nan indecent spectacle to see Dr. Johnson at dinner. But, above all, what\nmaniacal haste and hurry, as if the fiend were waiting with red-hot pincers\nto lay hold of the hindermost!",
        "Oh, reader, do you recognize in this abominable picture your respected\nancestors and ours? Excuse us for saying–\"What monsters!” We have a right\nto call our own ancestors monsters; and, if so, we must have the same right\nover yours. For Dr. Southey has shown plainly in the “Doctor,” that every\nman having four grand parents in the second stage of ascent, (each of whom\nhaving four, therefore,) sixteen in the third, and so on, long before you\nget to the Conquest, every man and woman then living in England will be\nwanted to make up the sum of my separate ancestors; consequently, you must\ntake your ancestors out of the very same fund, or (if you are too proud for\nthat) you must go without ancestors. So that, your ancestors being clearly\nmine, I have a right in law to call the whole “kit” of them monsters. Quod\nerat demonstrandum. Really and upon our honor, it makes one, for the\nmoment, ashamed of one’s descent; one would wish to disinherit one’s-self\nbackwards, and (as Sheridan says in the Rivals) to “cut the connection.\"\nWordsworth has an admirable picture in Peter Bell of “A snug party in a\nparlor,” removed into limbus patrum for their offences in the flesh:–",
        "  “Cramming, as they on earth were cramm’d;\n  All sipping wine, all sipping tea;\n  But, as you by their faces see,\n  All silent, and all d–d.”",
        "How well does that one word describe those venerable ancestral\ndinners–\"All silent!” Contrast this infernal silence of voice and fury\nof eye with the “risus amabilis,” the festivity, the social kindness, the\nmusic, the wine, the “dulcis insania,” of a Roman “coena.” We mentioned\nfour tests for determining what meal is, and what is not, dinner; we may\nnow add a fifth, viz. the spirit of festal joy and elegant enjoyment, of\nanxiety laid aside, and of honorable social pleasure put on like a marriage\ngarment.",
        "And what caused the difference between our ancestors and the Romans? Simply\nthis–the error of interposing dinner in the middle of business, thus\ncourting all the breezes of angry feeling that may happen to blow from the\nbusiness yet to come, instead of finishing, absolutely closing, the account\nwith this world’s troubles before you sit down. That unhappy interpolation\nruined all. Dinner was an ugly little parenthesis between two still uglier\nclauses of a tee-totally ugly sentence. Whereas with us, their enlightened\nposterity, to whom they have the honor to be ancestors, dinner is a great\nreaction. There lies our conception of the matter. It grew out of the very\nexcess of the evil. When business was moderate, dinner was allowed to\ndivide and bisect it. When it swelled into that vast strife and agony, as\none may call it, that boils along the tortured streets of modern London or\nother capitals, men began to see the necessity of an adequate counterforce\nto push against this overwhelming torrent, and thus maintain the\nequilibrium. Were it not for the soft relief of a six o’clock dinner, the\ngentle manner succeeding to the boisterous hubbub of the day, the soft\nglowing lights, the wine, the intellectual conversation, life in London is\nnow come to such a pass, that in two years all nerves would sink before it.\nBut for this periodic reaction, the modern business which draws so cruelly\non the brain, and so little on the hands, would overthrow that organ in\nall but those of coarse organization. Dinner it is,–meaning by dinner\nthe whole complexity of attendant circumstances,–which saves the modern\nbrain-working men from going mad.",
        "This revolution as to dinner was the greatest in virtue and value ever\naccomplished. In fact, those are always the most operative revolutions\nwhich are brought about through social or domestic changes. A nation must\nbe barbarous, neither could it have much intellectual business, which dined\nin the morning. They could not be at ease in the morning. So much must be\ngranted: every day has its separate quantum, its dose (as the doctrinists\nof rent phrase it) of anxiety, that could not be digested so soon as noon.\nNo man will say it. He, therefore, who dined at noon, was willing to sit\ndown squalid as he was, with his dress unchanged, his cares not washed off.\nAnd what follows from that? Why, that to him, to such a canine or cynical\nspecimen of the genus homo, dinner existed only as a physical event, a\nmere animal relief, a mere carnal enjoyment. For what, we demand, did this\nfleshly creature differ from the carrion crow, or the kite, or the vulture,\nor the cormorant? A French judge, in an action upon a wager, laid it down\nin law, that man only had a bouche, all other animals had a gueule:\nonly with regard to the horse, in consideration of his beauty, nobility,\nuse, and in honor of the respect with which man regarded him, by the\ncourtesy of Christendom, he might be allowed to have a bouche, and his\nreproach of brutality, if not taken away, might thus be hidden. But surely,\nof the rabid animal who is caught dining at noonday, the homo ferus, who\naffronts the meridian sun like Thyestes and Atreus, by his inhuman meals,\nwe are, by parity of reason, entitled to say, that he has a “maw,” (so has\nMilton’s Death,) but nothing resembling stomach. And to this vile man a\nphilosopher would say–\"Go away, sir, and come back to me two or three\ncenturies hence, when you have learned to be a reasonable creature, and to\nmake that physico-intellectual thing out of dinner which it was meant to\nbe, and is capable of becoming.” In Henry VII.’s time the court dined at\neleven in the forenoon. But even that hour was considered so shockingly\nlate in the French court, that Louis XII. actually had his gray hairs\nbrought down with sorrow to the grave, by changing his regular hour of\nhalf-past nine for eleven, in gallantry to his young English bride.[11] He\nfell a victim to late hours in the forenoon. In Cromwell’s time they dined\nat one, P.M. One century and a half had carried them on by two hours.\nDoubtless, old cooks and scullions wondered what the world would come to\nnext. Our French neighbors were in the same predicament. But they far\nsurpassed us in veneration for the meal. They actually dated from it.\nDinner constituted the great era of the day. L’apres diner is almost the\nsole date which you find in Cardinal De Retz’s memoirs of the Fronde.\nDinner was their Hegira–dinner was their line in traversing the ocean\nof day: they crossed the equator when they dined. Our English revolution\ncame next; it made some little difference, we have heard people say, in\nChurch and State; but its great effects were perceived in dinner. People\nnow dined at two. So dined Addison for his last thirty years; so dined\nPope, who was coeval with the revolution through his entire life. Precisely\nas the rebellion of 1745 arose, did people (but observe, very great people)\nadvance to four, P.M. Philosophers, who watch the “semina rerum,” and the\nfirst symptoms of change, had perceived this alteration singing in the\nupper air like a coming storm some little time before. About the year 1740,\nPope complains to a friend of Lady Suffolk’s dining so late as four. Young\npeople may bear those things, he observes; but as to himself, now turned\nof fifty, if such doings went on, if Lady Suffolk would adopt such strange\nhours, he must really absent himself from Marble Hill. Lady Suffolk had a\nright to please herself: he himself loved her. But if she would persist,\nall which remained for a decayed poet was respectfully to “cut his stick,\nand retire.” Whether Pope ever put up with four o’clock dinners again, we\nhave vainly sought to fathom. Some things advance continuously, like a\nflood or a fire, which always make an end of A, eat and digest it, before\nthey go on to B. Other things advance per saltum–they do not silently\ncancer their way onwards, but lie as still as a snake after they have made\nsome notable conquest, then when unobserved they make themselves up “for\nmischief,” and take a flying bound onwards. Thus advanced dinner, and by\nthese fits got into the territory of evening. And ever as it made a motion\nonwards, it found the nation more civilized, (else the change would not\nhave been effected,) and raised them to a still higher civilization. The\nnext relay on that line of road, the next repeating frigate, is Cowper in\nhis poem on Conversation. He speaks of four o’clock as still the elegant\nhour for dinner–the hour for the lautiores and the lepidi homines. Now\nthis was written about 1780, or a little earlier; perhaps, therefore,\njust one generation after Pope’s Lady Suffolk. But then Cowper was living\namongst the rural gentry, not in high life; yet, again, Cowper was nearly\nconnected by blood with the eminent Whig house of Cowper, and acknowledged\nas a kinsman. About twenty-five years after this, we may take Oxford as\na good exponent of the national advance. As a magnificent body of\n\"foundations,” endowed by kings, and resorted to by the flower of the\nnational youth, Oxford is always elegant and even splendid in her habits.\nYet, on the other hand, as a grave seat of learning, and feeling the weight\nof her position in the commonwealth, she is slow to move: she is inert as\nshe should be, having the functions of resistance assigned to her against\nthe popular instinct of movement. Now, in Oxford, about 1804-5, there was\na general move in the dinner hour. Those colleges who dined at three, of\nwhich there were still several, now dined at four; those who had dined\nat four, now translated their hour to five. These continued good general\nhours, but still amongst the more intellectual orders, till about Waterloo.\nAfter that era, six, which had been somewhat of a gala hour, was promoted\nto the fixed station of dinner-time in ordinary; and there perhaps it will\nrest through centuries. For a more festal dinner, seven, eight, nine, ten,\nhave all been in requisition since then; but we have not yet heard of any\nman’s dining later than 10, P.M., except in that single classical instance\n(so well remembered from our father Joe) of an Irishman who must have dined\nmuch later than ten, because his servant protested, when others were\nenforcing the dignity of their masters by the lateness of their dinner\nhours, that his master dined “to-morrow.”",
        "Were the Romans not as barbarous as our own ancestors at one time? Most\ncertainly they were; in their primitive ages they took their coena at\nnoon,[12] that was before they had laid aside their barbarism; before\nthey shaved: it was during their barbarism, and in consequence of their\nbarbarism, that they timed their coena thus unseasonably. And this is\nmade evident by the fact, that, so long as they erred in the hour, they\nerred in the attending circumstances. At this period they had no music\nat dinner, no festal graces, and no reposing upon sofas. They sate bolt\nupright in chairs, and were as grave as our ancestors, as rabid, and\ndoubtless as furiously in haste.",
        "With us the revolution has been equally complex. We do not, indeed, adopt\nthe luxurious attitude of semi-recumbency; our climate makes that less\nrequisite; and, moreover, the Romans had no knives and forks, which could\nscarcely be used in that posture: they ate with their fingers from dishes\nalready cut up–whence the peculiar force of Seneca’s “post quod non sunt\nlavandæ manus.” But exactly in proportion as our dinner has advanced\ntowards evening, have we and has that advanced in circumstances of\nelegance, of taste, of intellectual value.” That by itself would be much.\nInfinite would be the gain for any people that it had ceased to be\nbrutal, animal, fleshly; ceased to regard the chief meal of the day as a\nministration only to an animal necessity; that they had raised it to a far\nhigher standard; associated it with social and humanizing feelings,\nwith manners, with graces both moral and intellectual; moral in the\nself-restraint; intellectual in the fact, notorious to all men, that the\nchief arenas for the easy display of intellectual power are at our dinner\ntables. But dinner has now even a greater function than this; as the\nfervor of our day’s business increases, dinner is continually more needed\nin its office of a great reaction. We repeat that, at this moment, but\nfor the daily relief of dinner, the brain of all men who mix in the strife\nof capitals would be unhinged and thrown off its centre.",
        "If we should suppose the case of a nation taking three equidistant meals\nall of the same material and the same quantity, all milk, for instance, it\nwould be impossible for Thomas Aquinas himself to say which was or was not\ndinner. The case would be that of the Roman ancile which dropped from\nthe skies; to prevent its ever being stolen, the priests made eleven\nfacsimiles of it, that the thief, seeing the hopelessness of\ndistinguishing the true one, might let all alone. And the result was, that,\nin the next generation, nobody could point to the true one. But our dinner,\nthe Roman coena, is distinguished from the rest by far more than the\nhour; it is distinguished by great functions, and by still greater\ncapacities. It is most beneficial; it may become more so.",
        "In saying this, we point to the lighter graces of music, and conversation\nmore varied, by which the Roman coena was chiefly distinguished from\nour dinner. We are far from agreeing with Mr. Croly, that the Roman meal\nwas more “intellectual” than ours. On the contrary, ours is the more\nintellectual by much; we have far greater knowledge, far greater means\nfor making it such. In fact, the fault of our meal is–that it is toointellectual; of too severe a character; too political; too much tending,\nin many hands, to disquisition. Reciprocation of question and answer,\nvariety of topics, shifting of topics, are points not sufficiently\ncultivated. In all else we assent to the following passage from Mr. Croly’s\neloquent Salathiel:–",
        "“If an ancient Roman could start from his slumber into the midst of\nEuropean life, he must look with scorn on its absence of grace, elegance,\nand fancy. But it is in its festivity, and most of all in its banquets,\nthat he would feel the incurable barbarism of the Gothic blood. Contrasted\nwith the fine displays that made the table of the Roman noble a picture,\nand threw over the indulgence of appetite the colors of the imagination,\nwith what eyes must he contemplate the tasteless and commonplace dress,\nthe coarse attendants, the meagre ornament, the want of mirth, music, and\nintellectual interest–the whole heavy machinery that converts the feast\ninto the mere drudgery of devouring!”",
        "Thus far the reader knows already that we dissent violently; and by looking\nback he will see a picture of our ancestors at dinner, in which they\nrehearse the very part in relation to ourselves that Mr. Croly supposes\nall moderns to rehearse in relation to the Romans; but in the rest of the\nbeautiful description, the positive, though not the comparative part, we\nmust all concur:–",
        "“The guests before me were fifty or sixty splendidly dressed men,\"\n(they were in fact Titus and his staff, then occupied with the siege of\nJerusalem,) “attended by a crowd of domestics, attired with scarcely less\nsplendor; for no man thought of coming to the banquet in the robes of\nordinary life. The embroidered couches, themselves striking objects,\nallowed the ease of position at once delightful in the relaxing climates of\nthe South, and capable of combining with every grace of the human figure.\nAt a slight distance, the table loaded with plate glittering under a\nprofusion of lamps, and surrounded by couches thus covered by rich\ndraperies, was like a central source of light radiating in broad shafts of\nevery brilliant hue. The wealth of the patricians, and their intercourse\nwith the Greeks, made them masters of the first performances of the arts.\nCopies of the most famous statues, and groups of sculpture in the precious\nmetals; trophies of victories; models of temples; were mingled with vases\nof flowers and lighted perfumes. Finally, covering and closing all, was\na vast scarlet canopy, which combined the groups beneath to the eye, and\nthrew the whole into the form that a painter would love.”",
        "Mr. Croly then goes on to insist on the intellectual embellishments of the\nRoman dinner; their variety, their grace, their adaptation to a festive\npurpose. The truth is, our English imagination, more profound than the\nRoman, is also more gloomy, less gay, less riante. That accounts for our\nwant of the gorgeous trictinium, with its scarlet draperies, and for many\nother differences both to the eye and to the understanding. But both we and\nthe Romans agree in the main point; we both discovered the true purpose\nwhich dinner might serve,–1, to throw the grace of intellectual enjoyment\nover an animal necessity; 2, to relieve and antagonize the toil of brain\nincident to high forms of social life.",
        "Our object has been to point the eye to this fact; to show uses imperfectly\nsuspected in a recurring accident of life; to show a steady tendency to\nthat consummation, by holding up, as in a mirror, (together with occasional\nglimpses of hidden corners in history,) the corresponding revolution\nsilently going on in a great people of antiquity.",

Those who took their\ncoena so early as this, were said de die coenare–to begin dining from\nhigh day. Just as the line in Horace–\"Ut jugulent homines surgunt de\nnocte latrones,” does not mean that the robbers rise when others are going\nto bed, viz., at nightfall, but at midnight. For, says one of the three\nbest scholars of this earth, de die, de nocte, mean from that hour\nwhich was most fully, most intensely day or night, viz., the centre, the\nmeridian.
