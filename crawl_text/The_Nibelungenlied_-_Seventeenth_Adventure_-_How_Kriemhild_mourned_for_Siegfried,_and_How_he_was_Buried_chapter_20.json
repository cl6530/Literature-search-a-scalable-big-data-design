        "There till the night they tarried / and o’er the Rhine they went.\nBy knights in chase might never / more evil day be spent;\nFor the game that there they hunted / wept many a noble maid.\nIn sooth by many a valiant / warrior must it since be paid.",
        "1003",
        "Of humor fierce and wanton / list now and ye shall hear,\nAnd eke of direst vengeance. / Hagen bade to bear\nSiegfried thus lifeless, / of the Nibelung country,\nUnto a castle dwelling / where Lady Kriemhild found might be.",
        "1004",
        "He bade in secret manner / to lay him there before\nWhere she should surely find him / when she from out the door\nShould pass to matins early, / ere that had come the day.\nIn sooth did Lady Kriemhild / full seldom fail the hour to pray.",
        "1005",
        "When, as was wont, in minster / the bell to worship bade,\nKriemhild, fair lady, wakened / from slumber many a maid:\nA light she bade them bring her / and eke her dress to wear.\nThen hither came a chamberlain / who Siegfried’s corse found waiting\n      there.",
        "1006",
        "He saw him red and bloody, / all wet his clothing too.\nThat it was his master, / in sooth no whit he knew.\nOn unto the chamber / the light in hand he bore,\nWhereby the Lady Kriemhild / did learn what brought her grief full sore.",
        "1007",
        "When she with train of ladies / would to the minster go,\nThen spake the chamberlain: / “Pause, I pray thee now:\nHere before thy dwelling / a noble knight lies slain.\"\nThereat gan Lady Kriemhild / in grief unmeasured sore to plain.",
        "1008",
        "Ere yet that ’twas her husband / she did rightly find,\nHad she Hagen’s question / begun to call to mind,\nHow might he protect him: / then first did break her heart,\nFor all her joy in living / did with his death from her depart.",
        "1009",
        "Unto the earth then sank she / ere she a word did say,\nAnd reft of all her pleasure / there the fair lady lay.\nSoon had Kriemhild’s sorrow / all measure passed beyond:\nShe shrieked, when past the swooning, / that did the chamber all resound.",
        "1010",
        "Then spake her attendants: / “What if’t a stranger were?\"\nFrom out her mouth the heart-blood / did spring from anguish sore.\nThen spake she: “It is Siegfried / my husband, other none:\nThis thing hath counselled Brunhild, / and Hagen’s hand the deed hath\n      done.”",
        "1011",
        "The lady bade them lead her / where did lie the knight,\nAnd his fair head she raised / with her hand full white.\nRed though it was and bloody / she knew him yet straightway,\nAs all forlorn the hero / of Nibelungenland there lay.",
        "1012",
        "Then cried the queen in anguish, / whose hand such wealth might wield:\n“O woe is me for sorrow! / Yet is not thy shield\nWith blow of sword now battered, / but murdered dost thou lie.\nAnd knew I who hath done it, / by my counsel should he die.”",
        "1013",
        "All of her attendants / did weep and wail enow\nWith their beloved mistress, / for filled they were with woe\nFor their noble master / whom they should see no more.\nFor anger of Queen Brunhild / had Hagen wrought revenge full sore.",
        "1014",
        "Then spake Kriemhild sorrowing: / “Hence now the message take,\nAnd all the men of Siegfried / shall ye straightway awake.\nUnto Siegmund likewise / tell ye my sorrow deep,\nIf that he will help me / for the doughty Siegfried weep.”",
        "1015",
        "Then ran straightway a messenger / and soon he found at hand,\nSiegfried’s valiant warriors / of Nibelungenland.\nOf joy he all bereft him / with tale that he did bear,\nNor would they aught believe it / till sound of weeping met their ear.",
        "1016",
        "The messenger came eke quickly / where the king did lie,\nYet closed was not in sleeping / the monarch Siegmund’s eye:\nI ween his heart did tell him / the thing that there had been,\nAnd that his dear son living / might nevermore by him be seen.",
        "1017",
        "“Awake, awake, Lord Siegmund. / Hither hath sent for thee\nKriemhild my mistress. / A wrong now beareth she,\nA grief that ’fore all others / unto her heart doth go:\nTo mourn it shalt thou help her, / for sorely hast thou need thereto.”",
        "1018",
        "Up raised himself then Siegmund. / He spake: “What may it be\nOf wrong that grieveth Kriemhild, / as thou hast told to me?\"\nThe messenger spake weeping: / “Now may I naught withhold:\nKnow thou that of Netherland / Siegfried brave lies slain and cold.”",
        "1019",
        "Thereto gave answer Siegmund: / “Let now such mocking be\nAnd tale of such ill tidings / –an thou regardest me–\nAs that thou say’st to any / now he lieth slain:\nAn were it so, I never / unto my end might cease to plain.”",
        "1020",
        "“Wilt thou now believe not / the tidings that I bear,\nSo may’st thyself the Lady / Kriemhild weeping hear,\nAnd all of her attendants, / that Siegfried lieth dead.\"\nWith terror filled was Siegmund: / whereof in very sooth was need.",
        "1021",
        "He and his men a hundred / from their beds they sprang,\nThen snatched in hand full quickly / swords both sharp and long,\nAnd toward the sound of weeping / in sorrow sore did speed.\nThere came a thousand warriors / eke of the valiant knight Siegfried.",
        "1022",
        "When they heard the women weeping / in such sore distress\nThought some, strict custom keeping, / we first must don our dress.\nIn sooth for very sorrow / their wits no more had they,\nFor on their hearts a burden / of grief full deep and heavy lay.",
        "1023",
        "Then came the monarch Siegmund / where he Kriemhild espied.\nHe spake: “Alack that ever / to this country I did ride!\nWho in such wondrous manner, / and while good friends are near,\nHath of my child bereft me / and thee of spouse thou hold’st so dear?”",
        "1024",
        "“Ah, might I him discover,\" / spake the lady high,\n“Evermore would mercy / I to him deny.\nSuch meed of vengeance should he / at my hands receive\nThat all who call him kinsman / reason good should have to grieve.”",
        "1025",
        "Siegmund the monarch / in arms the knight did press,\nAnd of his friends there gathered / so great was the distress,\nThat from the mighty wailing / palace and wide hall\nAnd Worms the city likewise / with sound of woe re-echoed all.",
        "1026",
        "None was who aught might comfort / the wife of Siegfried there.\nThey drew the knight’s attire / from off his body fair,\nFrom wounds the blood, too, washed they / and laid him on the bier.\nThen from all his people / a mighty wailing might ye hear.",
        "1027",
        "Then outspake his warriors / of Nibelungenland:\n“Until he be avenged / rest shall not our hand.\nHe is within this castle / who the deed hath done.\"\nThen rushed to find their weapons / Siegfried’s warriors every one.",
        "1028",
        "The knights of chosen valor / with shields did thither throng,\nEleven hundred warriors, / that did to train belong\nOf Siegmund the monarch. / That his son lay dead,\nWould he wreak dire vengeance, / whereof in very sooth was need.",
        "1029",
        "Yet knew they not whom should they / beset in battle then,\nIf it were not Gunther / and with him his men\nWith whom their lord Siegfried / unto the hunting rode.\nYet filled with fear was Kriemhild / when she beheld how armed they\n      stood.",
        "1030",
        "How great soe’er her sorrow / and stern the grief she bore,\nYet for the Nibelungen / feared she death full sore\nFrom her brother’s warriors, / and bade them hold their wrath.\nShe gave them kindly warning / as friend to friend beloved doth.",
        "1031",
        "Then spake she rich in sorrow: / “What thing beginnest thou,\nGood my lord Siegmund? / This case thou dost not know.\nIn sooth hath here King Gunther / so many a valiant knight,\nLost are ye all together, / will ye the thanes withstand in fight.”",
        "1032",
        "With shields upraised they ready / for the fight did stand.\nBut the queen full noble / did straightway give command\nTo those high knights, and prayed them, / their purpose to give o’er.\nThat she might not dissuade them, / in sooth to her was sorrow sore.",
        "1033",
        "Spake she thus: “Lord Siegmund, / thou shalt this thing let be\nUntil more fitting season. / Seek will I e’er with thee\nFull to avenge my husband. / Who him from me hath ta’en,\nAn I shall know him guilty, / in me shall surely find his bane.",
        "1034",
        "“Of warriors proud and mighty / are many here by Rhine,\nTherefore will I advise not / the struggle to begin.\nFor one that we can muster / good thirty men have they;\nAs unto us their dealing, / God them requite in equal way.",
        "1035",
        "“Here shall ye bide with me / and help my grief to bear;\nSoon as dawns the morning, / ye noble knights and rare,\nHelp me my loved husband / prepare for burial.\"\n“That shall be done full willing,\" / spake the doughty warriors all.",
        "1036",
        "To you could never any / full the wonder say,\nOf knights and noble ladies, / so full of grief were they,\nThat the sound of wailing / through the town was heard afar,\nWhereat the noble burghers / hastily did gather there.",
        "1037",
        "With the guests they mourned together, / for sore they grieved as well.\nWhat was the guilt of Siegfried / none to them might tell,\nWherefore the knight so noble / thus his life should lose.\nThen wept with the high ladies / many a worthy burgher’s spouse.",
        "1038",
        "Smiths they bade a casket / work full hastily\nAll of gold and silver / that great and strong should be.\nThey bade them fast to weld it / with bands of steel full good.\nThen saw ye all the people / stand right sorrowful of mood.",
        "1039",
        "Now the night was over, / for day, they said, drew near.\nThen bade the noble lady / unto the minster bear\nSiegfried her lord full loved / for whom she mourned so.\nWhoe’er was friend unto him, / him saw ye weeping thither go.",
        "1040",
        "As they brought him to the minster / bells full many rung.\nOn every hand then heard ye / how priests did chant their song.\nThither with his followers / came Gunther the king\nAnd eke the grim knight Hagen / where was sound of sorrowing.",
        "1041",
        "He spake: “Full loving sister, / alack for grief to thee,\nAnd that from such great evil / spared we might not be!\nHenceforth must we ever / mourn for Siegfried’s sake.\"\n“That do ye without reason,\" / full of woe the lady spake.",
        "1042",
        "“If that ye grieved for it, / befallen were it not.\nFor say I may full truly, / me had ye all forgot\nThere where I thus was parted / from my husband dear.\nWould it God,” spake Kriemhild, / “that done unto myself it were!”",
        "1043",
        "Fast they yet denied it. / Kriemhild spake again:\n“If any speak him guiltless, / let here be seen full plain.\nUnto the bier now shall he / before the people go;\nThus the truth full quickly / may we in this manner know.”",
        "1044",
        "It is a passing wonder / that yet full oft is seen,\nWhere blood-bespotted slayer / beside slain corse hath been,\nThat from the wounds come blood-drops, / as here it eke befell.\nThereby the guilt of Hagen / might they now full plainly tell.",
        "1045",
        "Now ran the wounds all bloody /like as they did before.\nWho erstwhile wept full sorely / now wept they mickle more.\nThen spake the monarch Gunther: / “To thee the truth be known:\nSlain hath he been by robbers, / nor is this deed by Hagen done.”",
        "1046",
        "“Of these same robbers,” spake she, / “full well I understand.\nGod give that yet may vengeance / wreak some friendly hand.\nGunther and Hagen, / yourselves have done this deed.\"\nThen looked for bloody conflict / the valiant thanes that served\n      Siegfried.",
        "1047",
        "Then spake unto them Kriemhild: / “Now bear with me my need.\"\nKnights twain came likewise hither / and did find him dead,–\nGernot her brother / and the young Giselher.\nWith upright hearts then joined they / with the others grief to share.",
        "1048",
        "They mourned for Kriemhild’s husband / with hearts all full of woe.\nA mass should then be chanted: / to the minster forth did go\nMan and child and woman / gathered from every side.\nE’en they did likewise mourn him / who little lost that Siegfried died.",
        "1049",
        "Gernot and Giselher spake: / “O Sister dear,\nNow comfort thee in sorrow, / for death is ever near.\nAmends we’ll make unto thee / the while that we shall live.\"\nIn the world might never any / unto her a comfort give.",
        "1050",
        "His coffin was made ready / about the middle day.\nFrom off the bier they raised him / whereupon he lay.\nBut yet would not the lady / let him be laid in grave.\nTherefor must all the people / first a mickle trouble have.",
        "1051",
        "In a shroud all silken / they the dead man wound.\nI ween that never any / that wept not might be found.\nThere mourned full of sorrow / Ute the queen full high\nAnd all of her attendants / that such a noble knight did die.",
        "1052",
        "When did hear the people / how they in minster sung,\nAnd that he there lay coffined, / came then a mickle throng:\nFor his soul’s reposing / what offerings they bore!\nE’en amid his enemies / found he of good friends a store.",
        "1053",
        "Kriemhild the poor lady / to her attendants spake:\n“Let them shun no trouble / to suffer for my sake,\nWho to him are friendly-minded / and me in honor hold;\nFor the soul of Siegfried / meted be to them his gold.”",
        "1054",
        "Child so small there was not, / did it but reason have,\nBut offering carried thither. / Ere he was laid in grave,\nMore than a hundred masses / upon the day they sung,\nOf all the friends of Siegfried / was gathered there a mickle throng.",
        "1055",
        "When were the masses over, / the folk departed soon.\nThen spake the Lady Kriemhild: / “Leave ye me not alone\nTo pass the night in watching / by this chosen thane now dead,\nWith whose passing from me / all my joy of life hath fled.",
        "1056",
        "“Three days and three nights further / shall he lie on bier,\nUntil my heart find quiet / that weeps for spouse so dear.\nGod perchance commandeth / that death eke me do take:\nThat were for me poor Kriemhild / fit end of all my woe to make.”",
        "1057",
        "Then of the town the people / went to their homes again.\nPriests and monks yet bade she / longer there remain,\nAnd all the hero’s followers / who willing served alway.\nThey watched a night all gruesome, / and full of toil was eke the day.",
        "1058",
        "Meat and drink forgetting / abode there many a one.\nIf any were would take it / ’twas unto all made known,\nThat have they might in plenty: / thus did provide Siegmund.\nThen for the Nibelungen / did trouble and sore need abound.",
        "1059",
        "The while the three days lasted / –such the tale we hear–\nAll who could join the chanting, / mickle must they bear\nThere of toil and trouble. / What gifts to them they bore!\nRich were seen full many / who did suffer need before.",
        "1060",
        "As many poor as found they / who themselves had naught,\nBy them yet an offering / bade they there be brought,\nOf gold of Siegfried’s treasure. / Though he no more might live,\nYet for his soul’s reposing / marks many thousand did they give.",
        "1061",
        "Land of fruitful income / bestowed Kriemhild around,\nWheresoever cloisters / and worthy folk were found.\nSilver and apparel / to the poor she gave in store,\nAnd in good manner showed she / that truest love to him she bore.",
        "1062",
        "Upon the third morning / at the mass’ tide\nWas there beside the minster / filled the church-yard wide\nWith country-folk a-weeping / that came from far and near:\nIn death they yet did serve him / as is meet for friend full dear.",
        "1063",
        "And so it hath been told us, / ere these four days were o’er,\nMarks full thirty thousand, / yea, in sooth, and more,\nFor his soul’s reposing / to the poor were given there:\nThe while that lay all broken / his life and eke his body fair.",
        "1064",
        "When ended was the service / and full the masses sung,\nIn unrestrained sorrow / there the flock did throng.\nThey bade that from the minster / he to the grave be borne.\nThem that fain had kept him / there beheld ye weep and mourn.",
        "1065",
        "Thence full loud lamenting / did the people with him pass.\nUnmoved there never any / nor man nor woman was.\nEre that in grave they laid him / chanted they and read.\nWhat host of priests full worthy / at his burial were gathered!",
        "1066",
        "Ere that the wife of Siegfried / was come unto the grave,\nWith water from the fountain / full oft her face they lave,\nSo struggled with her sorrow / the faithful lady fair.\nGreat beyond all measure / was the grief that she did bear.",
        "1067",
        "It was a mickle wonder / that e’er her life she kept.\nMany a lady was there / that helped her as she wept.\nThen spake the queen full noble: / “Ye men that service owe\nTo Siegfried, as ye love me, / now to me a mercy show.",
        "1068",
        "“Upon this sorrow grant ye / the little grace to me\nThat I his shining visage / yet once more may see.\"\nSo filled she was with anguish / and so long time she sought,\nPerforce they must break open / the casket all so fairly wrought.",
        "1069",
        "Where she did see him lying / they then the lady led.\nWith hand full white and spotless / raised she his fair head;\nThen kissed she there all lifeless / the good and noble knight,–\nAnd wept so that for sorrow / ran blood from out her eyes so bright.",
        "1070",
        "Mournful was the parting / that then did rend the twain.\nThence away they bore her, / nor might she walk again,\nBut in a swoon did senseless / the stately lady lie.\nIn sooth her winsome body / for sorrow sore was like to die.",
        "1071",
        "When they the knight full noble / now in the grave had laid,\nBeheld ye every warrior / beyond all measure sad\nThat with him was come hither / from Nibelung country.\nFull seldom joyous-hearted / might ye royal Siegmund see.",
        "1072",
        "And many were among them / that for sorrow great\nTill three days were over / did nor drink nor eat.\nYet might they not their bodies / long leave uncared-for so:\nFor food they turned from mourning / as people still are wont to do.",
