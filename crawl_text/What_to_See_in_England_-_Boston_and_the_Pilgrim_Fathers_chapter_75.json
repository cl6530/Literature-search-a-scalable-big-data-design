        "The English Boston, which gave its name to the great American seaport,\nwas at one time–although it is hard to believe–of as relatively great\nimportance as its mighty namesake of to-day. In the time of Edward III.\nit was considered the third most important town in England, for during\nthat reign it contributed no fewer than seventeen ships to the great\nfleet which was raised by Edward III. But Boston declined through its\nriver–the Witham–becoming scarcely navigable for more than small\nships, and after a time was placed on the list of decayed seaports. At\nthe present time it should be mentioned that its trade is steadily\nreviving.",
        "The town has a quiet, old-fashioned aspect, and many of its houses date\nfrom the days when the Pilgrim Fathers made their first attempt to leave\nEngland. The very first effort failed, through the treachery of the\ncaptain of the vessel in which they were to take passage. They suffered\na month’s imprisonment, but shortly afterwards made another attempt to\nget away from the coast on a Dutch ship. This was only partially\nsuccessful, for William Brewster and a few others only, reached\nAmsterdam, the women and the rest of the party having fallen into the\nhands of a detachment of soldiers. Brewster, however, by untiring\nefforts got all the rest over to Holland.",
        "It was in 1620 that the Pilgrim Fathers finally set out on their voyage\nto America. (See Index, Plymouth.) The greatest glory of Boston is “The\nStump,” the highly unsuitable name given to its magnificent church\ntower, 300 feet high, and a landmark all over the surrounding fen-lands\nand even out at sea. It seems strangely slight when one is standing\nwithin the tower and notices that no floor breaks the great sweep of\nwalls for a great height. The large perpendicular windows also help to\ngive an impression of frailty. The foundation stone, however, was laid\nas long ago as 1309, and the structure is not so many years younger.",
