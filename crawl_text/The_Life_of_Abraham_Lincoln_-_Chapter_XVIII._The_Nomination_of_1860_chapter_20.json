        "\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865)\n16th President of the United States",
        "\n\n",
        "The subject of this chapter is the republican convention that nominated\nLincoln for the presidency. But for an intelligent narration of this,\nit is necessary to give a brief account of at least one of the three\nother important political conventions that were held that year. That\none was the regular democratic convention at Charleston. And certain\nother facts also must be narrated.",
        "Leaven was working in two respects. The first is that the plan of\nsecession and of setting up a Southern nation founded upon slavery, was\nnot a sudden or impromptu thought. The evidence is conclusive that the\nplan had been maturing for years. Recent events had shown that slavery\nhad reached the limit of its development so far as concerned the\nterritory of the United States. The plan to annex Cuba as a garden for\nthe culture of slavery, had failed. California had been admitted as a\nfree state. Slavery had been excluded from Kansas, although that\nterritory had for two years been denied admission to the sisterhood of\nstates.",
        "As the slave power was not content with any limitation whatever, its\nleaders now looked for an opportunity to break up this present\ngovernment and start a new one. At the time (December, 1860) South\nCarolina passed the ordinance of secession, to be narrated later,\ncertain things were said which may be quoted here. These utterances\nexposed the spirit that animated the slave power long before Lincoln’s\nelection, long before he was even known in politics.",
        "Parker said that the movement of secession had been “gradually\nculminating for a long series of years.”",
        "Inglis endorsed the remark and added, “Most of us have had this matter\nunder consideration for the last twenty years.”",
        "Keitt said, “I have been engaged in this movement ever since I\nentered political life.”",
        "Rhett said, “The secession of South Carolina was not the event of a\nday. It is not anything produced by Mr. Lincoln’s election, or by the\nnon-execution of the fugitive slave law. It is a matter which has been\ngathering head for thirty years. The election of Lincoln and\nHamlin was the last straw on the back of the camel. But it was not the\nonly one. The back was nearly broken before.",
        "The other important fact was the result of Lincoln’s Freeport question.\nThe answer of Douglas was: “I answer emphatically ... that in my\nopinion the people of a territory can, by lawful means, exclude slavery\nfrom its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution.” This\nanswer satisfied the democrats of Illinois and secured his election to\nthe senate, as Lincoln predicted that it would. But it angered the\nsouthern leaders beyond all reason–as Lincoln knew it would.",
        "When, therefore, the democratic convention met in Charleston, the first\npurpose of the southern leaders was to defeat Douglas. In their\njudgment he was not orthodox on slavery. He was far the strongest\ncandidate before the convention, but he was not strong enough to secure\nthe two-thirds vote which under the rules of that party were necessary\nto a choice. After fifty-seven ballots, and a corresponding amount of\ndebating, the feeling of antagonism rising, continually higher, the\ncrisis came. The southern delegates withdrew from the convention and\nappointed a convention of their own to be held in Richmond. This was\ndone with the full knowledge that, if it accomplished anything, it\nwould accomplish the defeat of the party. It was probably done for this\nvery purpose,–to defeat the party,–so as to give an excuse, more or\nless plausible, for carrying out the matured plan of secession,\nclaiming to be injured or alarmed at the ascendancy of the republican\nparty.",
        "Up to this point, at least, Lincoln had no aspirations for the\npresidency. But he did aspire to the United States senate. He accepted\nhis defeat by Douglas in 1858 as only temporary. He knew there would be\nanother senatorial election in four years. When asked how he felt about\nthis defeat, he turned it into a joke, and said that he felt “like the\nboy who had stubbed his toe, too badly to laugh, and he was too big to\ncry.”",
        "He had thought of being nominated as vice-president with Seward as\nPresident, which would have given him, if elected, a place in the\nsenate. He was glad of any possible prominence in the Chicago\nconvention, which was still in the future. For that would help his\nsenatorial aspirations when the time came. But as to anything higher,\nhe declared, “I must in all candor say that I do not think myself fit\nfor the presidency.” And he was an honest man. With the senate still in\nview, he added, “I am not in a position where it would hurt me much not\nto be nominated [for president] on the national ticket; but I am where\nit would hurt some for me not to get the Illinois delegates.”",
        "Thus, at the beginning of the year 1860, Lincoln was in no sense in the\nrace for the presidential nomination. About that time a list of twenty-\none names of possible candidates was published in New York; Lincoln’s\nname was not on the list. A list of thirty-five was published in\nPhiladelphia. Lincoln’s name was not on that list. After the speech at\nCooper Institute the Evening Post mentioned Lincoln’s name along with\nothers. That was the only case in the East.",
        "In Illinois his candidacy developed in February and came to ahead at\nthe republican state convention at Decatur. Lincoln’s name had been\nprominent in the preceding local conventions, and the enthusiasm was\ngrowing. Decatur was very near to the place where Thomas Lincoln had\nfirst settled when he came into the state. When Abraham Lincoln came\ninto this convention he was greeted with an outburst of enthusiasm.\nAfter order had been restored, the chairman, Governor Oglesby,\nannounced that an old-time Macon County democrat desired to make a\ncontribution to the convention. The offer being accepted, a banner was\nborne up the hall upon two old fence rails. The whole was gaily\ndecorated and the inscription was:",
        "This incident was the means of enlarging the soubriquet “Honest Abe” to\n“Honest Old Abe, the Rail-splitter.” The enthusiasm over the rails\nspread far and wide. That he had split rails, and that he even had done\nit well, was no test of his statesmanship. But it was a reminder of his\nhumble origin, and it attached him to the common people, between whom\nand himself there had always been a warm feeling of mutual sympathy.",
        "The democratic convention had, after the bolt of the extreme\nsoutherners, adjourned to Baltimore, where they duly nominated Douglas.\nWhat any one could have done for the purpose of restoring harmony in\nthe party, he did. But the breach was too wide for even that astute\npolitician to bridge over. Lincoln grasped the situation. It was what\nhe had planned two years before, and he confidently expected just this\nbreach. “Douglas never can be President,” he had said. He fully\nunderstood the relentless bitterness of the slave power, and he well\nknew that whatever Douglas might do for the northern democrats, he had\nlost all influence with the southern branch of that party. So Lincoln\ntold his “little story” and serenely awaited the result.",
        "The second republican national convention met in Chicago, May 16, 1860.\nA temporary wooden structure, called a wigwam, had been built for the\npurpose. It was, for those days, a very large building, and would\naccommodate about ten thousand people.",
        "The man who was, far and away, the most prominent candidate for the\nnomination, was William H. Seward, of New York. He had the benefit of\nthirty years of experience in political life. He was a man of wide\nlearning, fine culture, unequaled as a diplomatist; he was a patriot, a\nstatesman, and loyal to the principles of the republican party. He had\na plurality of the delegates by a wide margin, though not a majority.\nIt seemed a foregone conclusion that he would be nominated. Horace\nGreeley, who was determinedly opposed to him, gave up the contest and\ntelegraphed to his paper that Seward would be nominated. The\nopposition, he said, could not unite on any one man.",
        "The next most prominent name was Lincoln. He had the full delegation of\nIllinois, who, at Decatur, had been instructed to vote for him as “the\nfirst and only choice” of the state. He had many votes, too, from the\nneighboring states.",
        "In addition to these two candidates before the convention, there were\nhalf a dozen others, all “favorite sons” of their own states, but who\nat no time developed any great strength.",
        "The only point against Seward was his inability to carry certain\ndoubtful states. If the split in the democratic party had not occurred,\nand if the election were to be carried according to the experience of\n1856, it would be necessary for the republicans to carry certain states\nwhich they had at that time failed to carry. The most available states\nwere Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Indiana, and Illinois. Under favorable\ncircumstances, these could be carried. Seward’s long public career had\ninevitably caused antagonisms, and these necessary states he could not\ncarry. The question with his opponents then was, Who is most likely to\ncarry these states? Lincoln’s popularity in three of the four states\nnamed singled him out as the rival of Seward. It then became only a\nquestion whether the opposition to Seward could or could not unite in\nthe support of Lincoln.",
        "At this point there came in a political ruse which has been often used\nin later years. Seward’s friends had taken to Chicago a small army of\nclaquers, numbering nearly or quite two thousand. These were\ndistributed through the audience and were apparently under orders to\nshout whenever Seward’s name was mentioned. This gave the appearance of\nspontaneous applause and seemed to arouse great enthusiasm for the\ncandidate.",
        "Lincoln’s friends soon came to understand the situation and planned to\nbeat their rivals at their own game. They sent out into the country and\nsecured two men with phenomenal voices. It was said, with playful\nexaggeration, that these two men could shout so as to be heard across\nLake Michigan. They were made captains of two stentorian bands of\nfollowers. These were placed on opposite sides of the auditorium and\nwere instructed to raise the shout at a preconcerted signal and keep it\nup as long as desired. The plan worked.",
        "Leonard Swett describes the result: “Caleb B. Smith of Indiana then\nseconded the nomination of Lincoln, and the West came to his rescue. No\nmortal before ever saw such a scene. The idea of us Hoosiers and\nSuckers being out-screamed would have been as bad to them as the loss\nof their man. Five thousand people at once leaped to their seats, women\nnot wanting in the number, and the wild yell made soft vesper\nbreathings of all that had preceded. No language can describe it. A\nthousand steam-whistles, ten acres of hotel gongs, a tribe of Comanches\nheaded by a choice vanguard from pandemonium, might have mingled in the\nscene unnoticed.”",
        "A dramatic scene had occurred at the adoption of the platform. When the\nfirst resolution was read, Joshua E. Giddings, an old-time abolitionist\nof the extreme type, moved as an amendment to incorporate the words\nfrom the Declaration of Independence which announce the right of all\nmen to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” The hostility to\nthis amendment was not so much owing to an objection to the phrase, as\nto its being introduced upon the motion of so extreme a partisan as\nGiddings. The new party was made up of men of various old parties, and\nit was important that the moderate democrats should not be antagonized\nby the extreme abolitionists. The motion was lost by a decided vote,\nand the old man, almost broken-hearted, left the hall amid the\nprotestations of his associates.",
        "There then came to his rescue a young man, about thirty-six years of\nage, who was then not widely known, but who since has more than once\ndecidedly influenced republican conventions at a critical stage of the\nproceedings. It was George William Curtis. When the second resolution\nwas under consideration he presented the amendment of Giddings in a\nform slightly modified. He then urged it in an impassioned speech, and\nby his torrent of eloquence carried the enthusiasm of the convention\nwith him. “I have to ask this convention,” he concluded, “whether they\nare prepared to go upon the record before the country as voting down\nthe words of the Declaration of Independence.... I rise simply to ask\ngentlemen to think well before, upon the free prairies of the West, in\nthe summer of 1860, they dare to wince and quail before the assertion\nof the men of Philadelphia in 1776–before they dare to shrink from\nrepeating the words that these great men enunciated.”",
        "The amendment was adopted in a storm of applause. Giddings, overjoyed\nat the result, returned to the hall. He threw his arms about Curtis\nand, with deep emotion, exclaimed,–\"God bless you, my boy! You have\nsaved the republican party. God bless you!”",
        "The candidates in those days were simply announced without speeches of\nglorification, Mr. Evarts of New York named Seward, and Mr. Judd of\nIllinois named Lincoln. The names of half a dozen “favorite sons” were\noffered by their states, the most important being Bates of Missouri.\nAfter the seconding of the nominations the convention proceeded to the\nballot. There were 465 votes, and 233 were necessary for a choice.",
        "On the first ballot Seward received 173-1/2, and Lincoln, 102. The rest\nwere scattering. On the second ballot Seward received 184-1/2, and\nLincoln, 181. Seward was still ahead, but Lincoln had made by far the\ngreater gain. On the third ballot Seward received 180, and Lincoln 231-\n1/2. But this ballot was not announced. The delegates kept tally during\nthe progress of the vote. When it became evident that Lincoln was about\nelected, while the feeling of expectancy was at the highest degree of\ntension, an Ohio delegate mounted his chair and announced a change of\nfour Ohio votes from Chase to Lincoln. There was instantly a break. On\nevery side delegates announced a change of vote to Lincoln. The result\nwas evident to every one, and after a moment’s pause, the crowd went\nmad with joy. One spectator has recorded the event:",
        "“The scene which followed baffles all human description. After an\ninstant’s silence, which seemed to be required to enable the assembly\nto take in the full force of the announcement, the wildest and\nmightiest yell (for it can be called by no other name) burst forth from\nten thousand voices which were ever heard from mortal throats. This\nstrange and tremendous demonstration, accompanied with leaping up and\ndown, tossing hats, handkerchiefs, and canes recklessly into the air,\nwith the waving of flags, and with every other conceivable mode of\nexultant and unbridled joy, continued steadily and without pause for\nperhaps ten minutes.”",
        "“It then began to rise and fall in slow and billowing bursts, and for\nperhaps the next five minutes, these stupendous waves of uncontrollable\nexcitement, now rising into the deepest and fiercest shouts, and then\nsinking, like the ground swell of the ocean, into hoarse and lessening\nmurmurs, rolled through the multitude. Every now and then it would seem\nas though the physical power of the assembly was exhausted, when all at\nonce a new hurricane would break out, more prolonged and terrific than\nanything before. If sheer exhaustion had not prevented, we don’t know\nbut the applause would have continued to this hour.”",
        "During all this time Lincoln remained at Springfield, where he was in\ntelegraphic communication with his friends at Chicago, though not by\nprivate wire. At the time of his nomination he had gone from his office\nto that of the Sangamon Journal. A messenger boy came rushing up\nto him, carrying a telegram and exclaiming, “You are nominated.” The\nfriends who were present joyously shook his hands and uttered their\neager congratulations. Lincoln thanked them for their good wishes, and\nsaid “There is a little woman on Eighth Street who will be glad to hear\nthis, and I guess I’ll go up and carry her the news.” Pocketing the\ntelegram he walked home.",
        "At the wigwam, the news spread quickly. A man had been stationed on the\nroof as picket. He shouted, “Hallelujah! Abe Lincoln is nominated. Fire\nthe cannon!” The frenzy of joy spread to the immense throng of citizens\noutside the wigwam, then through the city, then through the state, then\nthrough the neighboring states. At Washington that night some one\nasked, “Who is this man Lincoln, anyhow?” Douglas replied, “There won’t\nbe a tar barrel left in Illinois’ tonight.” With unprecedented\nenthusiasm the republican party started on this campaign which led to\nits first victory in the election of Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, and\nHannibal Hamlin of Maine.",
