        "Thus entertaining themselves, the men sat talking. The mother\nWent meanwhile to look for her son in front of the dwelling,\nFirst on the settle of stone, whereon ’twas his wont to he seated.\nWhen she perceived him not there, she went farther to look in the stable,\nIf he were caring perhaps for his noble horses, the stallions,\nWhich he as colts had bought, and whose care he intrusted to no one.\nAnd by the servant she there was told: He is gone to the garden.\nThen with a nimble step she traversed the long, double courtyards,\nLeaving the stables behind, and the well-builded barns, too, behind her;\nEntered the garden, that far as the walls of the city extended;\nWalked through its length, rejoiced as she went in every thing growing;\nSet upright the supports on which were resting the branches\nHeavily laden with apples, and burdening boughs of the pear-tree.\nNext some caterpillars removed from a stout, swelling cabbage;\nFor an industrious woman allows no step to be wasted.\nThus was she come at last to the end of the far-reaching garden,\nWhere stood the arbor embowered in woodbine; nor there did she find him,\nMore than she had hitherto in all her search through the garden.\nBut the wicket was standing ajar, which out of the arbor,\nOnce by particular favor, had been through the walls of the city\nCut by a grandsire of hers, the worshipful burgomaster.\nSo the now dried-up moat she next crossed over with comfort,\nWhere, by the side of the road, direct the well-fencd vineyard,\nRose with a steep ascent, its slope exposed to the sunshine.\nUp this also she went, and with pleasure as she was ascending\nMarked the wealth of the clusters, that scarce by their leafage were hidden.\nShady and covered the way through the lofty middlemost alley,\nWhich upon steps that were made of unhewn blocks you ascended.\nThere were the Muscatel, and there were the Chasselas hanging\nSide by side, of unusual size and colored with purple,\nAll set out with the purpose of decking the visitor’s table;\nWhile with single vine-stocks the rest of the hillside was covered,\nBearing inferior clusters, from which the delicate wine comes.\nThus up the slope she went, enjoying already the vintage,\nAnd that festive clay on which the whole country, rejoicing,\nPicks and tramples the grapes, and gathers the must into vessels:\nFireworks, when it is evening, from every direction and corner\nCrackle and blaze, and so the fairest of harvests is honored.\nBut more uneasy she went, her son after twice or thrice calling,\nAnd no answer receiving, except from the talkative echo,\nThat with many repeats rang back from the towers of the city.",
        "Strange it was for her to seek him; he never had gone to a distance\nThat he told her not first, to spare his affectionate mother\nEvery anxious thought, and fear that aught ill had befallen.\nStill did she constantly hope that, if further she went, she should find him;\nFor the two doors of the vineyard, the lower as well as the upper,\nBoth were alike standing open. So now she entered the cornfield,\nThat with its broad expanse the ridge of the hill covered over.\nStill was the ground that she walked on her own; and the crops she rejoiced in,—\nAll of them still were hers, and hers was the proud-waving grain, too,\nOver the whole broad field in golden strength that was stirring.\nKeeping the ridgeway, the footpath, between the fields she went onward,\nHaving the lofty pear-tree in view, which stood on the summit,\nAnd was the boundary-mark of the fields that belonged to her dwelling.\nWho might have planted it, none could know, but visible was it\nFar and wide through the country; the fruit of the pear-tree was famous.\n’Neath it the reapers were wont to enjoy their meal at the noon-day,\nAnd the shepherds were used to tend their flocks in its shadow.\nBenches of unhewn stones and of turf they found set about it.\nAnd she had not been mistaken, for there sat her Hermann, and rested,—\nSat with his head on his hand, and seemed to be viewing the landscape\nThat to the mountains lay: his back was turned to his mother.\nTowards him softly she crept, and lightly touched on the shoulder;\nQuick he turned himself round: there were tears in his eyes as he met her.",
        "“Mother, how hast thou surprised me!” he said in confusion; and quickly\nWiped the high-spirited youth his tears away. But the mother,\n“What! do I find thee weeping, my son?” exclaimed in amazement.\n“Nay, that is not like thyself: I never before have so seen thee!\nTell me, what burdens thy heart? what drives thee here, to be sitting\nUnder the pear-tree alone? These tears in thine eyes, what has brought them?”",
        "Then, collecting himself, the excellent youth made her answer:\n“Truly no heart can that man have in his bosom of iron,\nWho is insensible now to the needs of this emigrant people;\nHe has no brains in his head, who not for his personal safety,\nNot for his fatherland’s weal, in days like the present is anxious.\nDeeply my heart had been touched by the sights and sounds of the morning;\nThen I went forth and beheld the broad and glorious landscape\nSpreading its fertile slopes in every direction about us,\nSaw the golden grain inclining itself to the reapers,\nAnd the promise of well-filled barns from the plentiful harvest.\nBut, alas, how near is the foe! The Rhine with its waters\nGuards us, indeed; but, ah, what now are rivers and mountains\n’Gainst that terrible people that onward bears like a tempest!\nFor they summon their youths from every quarter together,\nCall up their old men too, and press with violence forward.\nDeath cannot frighten the crowd: one multitude follows another.\nAnd shall a German dare to linger behind in his homestead?\nHopes he perhaps to escape the everywhere threatening evil?\nNay, dear mother, I tell thee, to-day has made me regretful\nThat I was lately exempt, when out of our townsmen were chosen\nThose who should serve in the army. An only son I am truly,\nAlso our business is great, and the charge of our household is weighty.\nYet were it better, I deem, in the front to offer resistance\nThere on the border, than here to await disaster and bondage.\nSo has my spirit declared, and deep in my innermost bosom\nCourage and longing have now been aroused to live for my country,\nYea, and to die, presenting to others a worthy example.\nIf but the strength of Germany’s youth were banded together\nThere on the frontier, resolved that it never would yield to the stranger,\nAh, he should not on our glorious soil be setting his foot-steps,\nNeither consuming before our eyes the fruit of our labor,\nRuling our men, and making his prey of our wives and our daughters.\nHark to me, mother: for I in the depths of my heart am determined\nQuickly to do, and at once, what appears to me right and in reason;\nFor he chooses not always the best who longest considers.\nHearken, I shall not again return to the house; but directly\nGo from this spot to the city, and there present to the soldiers\nThis right arm and this heart, to be spent in the fatherland’s service.\nThen let my father say if there be no feeling of honor\nDwelling within my breast, nor a wish to raise myself higher.\"\nThen with significant words spoke the good and intelligent mother,\nWhile from her eyes the quick-starting tears were silently falling:\n“Son, what change has come o’er thee to-day, and over thy temper,\nThat thou speakest no more, as thou yesterday didst, and hast always,\nOpen and free, to thy mother, and tellest exactly thy wishes?\nAny one else, had he heard thee thus speak, would in sooth have commended,\nAnd this decision of thine would have highly approved as most noble,\nBeing misled by thy tone and by thy significant language.\nYet have I nothing but censure to speak; for better I know thee.\nThou concealest thy heart, and thy thoughts are not such as thou tellest.\nWell do I know that it is not the drum, not the trumpet that calls thee:\nNeither in uniform wouldst thou figure in sight of the maidens;\nSince, for all thou art honest and brave, it is thy vocation\nHere in quiet to care for the farm and provide for the household.\nTell me honestly, therefore, what goads thee to such a decision?”",
        "Earnestly answered the son: “Nay, thou art mistaken, dear mother:\nOne day is not like another. The youth matures into manhood:\nBetter in stillness oft ripening to deeds than when in the tumult\nWildering and wild of existence, that many a youth has corrupted.\nAnd, for as still as I am and was always, there yet in my bosom\nHas such a heart been shaped as abhors all wrong and injustice;\nAnd I have learned aright between worldly things to distinguish.\nArm and foot, besides, have been mightily strengthened by labor.\nAll this, I feel, is true: I dare with bo1dness maintain it.\nYet dost thou blame me with reason, O mother! for thou hast surprised me\nUsing a language half truthful and half that of dissimulation.\nFor, let me honestly own,—it is not the near danger that calls me\nForth from my father’s house; nor is it the lofty ambition\nHelpful to be to my country, and terrible unto the foeman.\nThey were but words that I spoke: they only were meant for concealing\nThose emotions from thee with which my heart is distracted;\nAnd so leave me, O mother! for, since the wishes are fruitless\nWhich in my bosom I cherish, my life must go fruitlessly overover.\nFor, as I know, he injures himself who is singly devoted,\nWhen for the common cause the whole are not working together.”",
        "“Hesitate not,” replied thereupon the intelligent mother,\n“Every thing to relate me, the smallest as well as the greatest.\nMen will always be hasty, their thoughts to extremes ever running:\nEasily out of their course the hasty are turned by a hindrance.\nWhereas a woman is clever in thinking of means, and will venture\nE’en on a roundabout way, adroitly to compass her object.\nLet me know every thin, then; say wherefore so greatly excited\n’As I ne’er saw thee before, why thy blood is coursing so hotly,\nWherefore, against thy will, tears are filling thine eyes to o’erflowing.”",
        "Then he abandoned himself, the poor boy, to his sorrow, and weeping,\nWeeping aloud on his kind mother’s breast, he brokenly answered:\n“Truly my father’s words to-day have wounded me sorely,—\nWords which I have not deserved; not to-day, nor at any time have I:\nFor it was early my greatest delight to honor my parents.\nNo one knew more, so I deemed, or was wiser than those who begot me,\nAnd had with strictness ruled throughout the dark season of childhood.\nMany the things, in truth, I with patience endured from my playmates,\nWhen the good-will that I bore them they often requited with malice.\nOften I suffered their flings and their blows to pass unresented;\nBut if they ventured to ridicule father, when he of a Sunday\nHome from Church would come, with his solemn and dignified bearing;\nIf they made fun of his cap-string, or laughed at the flowers of the wrapper\nHe with such stateliness wore, which was given away but this morning,—\nThreateningly doubled my fist in an instant; with furious passion\nFell I upon them, and struck out and hit, assailing them blindly,\nSeeing not where. They howled as the blood gushed out from their noses:\nScarcely they made their escape from my passionate kicking and beating.\nThen, as I older grew, I had much to endure from my father;\nViolent words he oft vented on me, instead of on others,\nWhen, at the board’s last session, the council had roused his displeasure,\nAnd I was made to atone for the quarrels and wiles of his colleagues.\nThou has pitied me often thyself; for much did I suffer,\nEver remembering with cordial respect the kindness of parents,\nSolely intent on increasing for us their goods and possessions,\nMuch denying themselves in order to save for their children.\nBut, alas! saving alone, for the sake of a tardy enjoyment,—\nThat is not happiness: pile upon pile, and acre on acre,\nMake us not happy, no matter how fair our estates may be rounded.\nFor the father grows old, and with him will grow old the children,\nLosing the joy of the day, and bearing the care of tomorrow.\nLook thou below, and see how before us in glory are lying,\nFair and abundant, the corn-fields; beneath them, the vineyard and garden;\nYonder the stables and barns; our beautiful line of possessions.\nBut when I look at the dwelling behind, where up in the gable\nWe can distinguish the window that marks my room in the attic;\nWhen I look back, and remember how many a night from that window\nI for the moon have watched; for the sun, how many a morning!\nWhen the healthful sleep of a few short hours sufficed me,—\nAh, so lonely they seem to me then, the chamber and courtyard,\nGarden and glorious field, away o’er the hill that is stretching;\nAll so desert before me lie: ’tis the wife that is wanting.”",
        "Thereupon spoke the good mother, and thus with intelligence answered:\n“Son, not greater thy wish to bring thee a bride to thy chamber,\nThat thou mayst find thy nights a beautiful part of existence,\nAnd that the work of the day may gain independence and freedom,\nThan is thy father’s wish too, and thy mother’s. We always have counselled,—\nYea, we have even insisted,—that thou shouldst select thee a maiden.\nBut I was ever aware, and now my heart gives me assurance,\nThat till the hour appointed is come, and the maiden appointed\nShall with the hour appear, the choice will be left for the future,\nWhile more strong than all else will be fear of grasping the wrong one.\nIf I may say it, my son, I believe thou already hast chosen;\nFor thy heart has been touched, and been made more than wontedly tender.\nSpeak it out honestly, then; for my soul has told me beforehand:\nThat same maiden it is, the exile, whom thou hast elected.”",
        "“Thou has said, mother!” the son thereupon with eagerness answered.\n“Yes, it is she; and if I to-day as my bride do not bring her\nHome to our dwelling, she from me will go, perhaps vanish for ever,\nLost in the war’s confusion and sad movings hither and thither.\nMother, for ever in vain would then our abundant possessions\nProsper before me, and seasons to come be in vain to me fruitful.\nYea, I should hold in aversion the wonted house and the garden:\nEven my mother’s love, alas! would not comfort my sorrow.\nEvery tie, so I feel in my heart, by love is unloosened\nSoon as she fastens her own; and not the maid is it only\nLeaves behind father and mother, to follow the man she has chosen.\nHe too, the youth, no longer knows aught of mother and father,\nWhen he the maiden, his only beloved, sees vanishing from him.\nSuffer me, then, to go hence wherever despair shall impel me:\nSince by my father himself the decisive words have been spoken;\nSince his house can no longer be mine if he shut out the maiden,\nHer whom alone as my bride I desire to bring to our dwelling.”",
        "Thereupon quickly made answer the good and intelligent mother:\n“How like to rocks, forsooth, two men will stand facing each other!\nProud and not to be moved, will neither draw near to his fellow;\nNeither will stir his tongue to utter the first word of kindness.\nTherefore I tell thee, my son, a hope yet lives in my bosom,\nSo she be honest and good, thy father will let thee espouse her,\nEven though poor, and against a poor girl so decisive his sentence.\nMany a thing he is wont to speak out in his violent fashion\nWhich he yet never performs; and so what he denies will consent to.\nYet he requires a kindly word, and is right to require it: He is the father!\nBesides we know that his wrath after dinner,—\nWhen he most hastily speaks, and questions all others’ opinions,—\nSignifies naught; the full force of his violent will is excited\nThen by the wine, which lets him not heed the language of others;\nNone but himself does he see and feel. But now is come evening,\nTalk upon various subjects has passed between him and his neighbors.\nGentle, he is; I am sure now his little excitement is over,\nAnd he can feel how unjust his passion has made him to others.\nCome, let us venture at once: success is alone to the valiant!\nFurther we need the friends, still sitting together there with him,;\nAnd in especial the worthy pastor will give us assistance.”",
        "Thus she hastily spoke, and up from the stone then arising,\nDrew from his seat her son, who willingly followed. In silence\nBoth descended the hill, their important purpose revolving.",
