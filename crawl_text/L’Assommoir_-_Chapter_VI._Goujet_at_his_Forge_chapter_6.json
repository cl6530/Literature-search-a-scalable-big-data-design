        "One autumnal afternoon Gervaise, who had been to carry a basket of\nclothes home to a customer who lived a good way off, found herself in\nLa Rue des Poissonniers just as it was growing dark. It had rained in\nthe morning, and the air was close and warm. She was tired with her\nwalk and felt a great desire for something good to eat. Just then she\nlifted her eyes and, seeing the name of the street, she took it into\nher head that she would call on Goujet at his forge. But she would ask\nfor Etienne, she said to herself. She did not know the number, but she\ncould find it, she thought. She wandered along and stood bewildered,\nlooking toward Montmartre; all at once she heard the measured click of\nhammers and concluded that she had stumbled on the place at last. She\ndid not know where the entrance to the building was, but she caught a\ngleam of a red light in the distance; she walked toward it and was met\nby a workman.",
        "“Is it here, sir,” she said timidly, “that my child–a little boy,\nthat is to say–works? A little boy by the name of Etienne?”",
        "“Etienne! Etienne!” repeated the man, swaying from side to side. The\nwind brought from him to her an intolerable smell of brandy, which\ncaused Gervaise to draw back and say timidly:",
        "“Is it here that Monsieur Goujet works?”",
        "“Ah, Goujet, yes. If it is Goujet you wish to see go to the left.”",
        "Gervaise obeyed his instructions and found herself in a large room\nwith the forge at the farther end. She spoke to the first man she saw,\nwhen suddenly the whole room was one blaze of light. The bellows had\nsent up leaping flames which lit every crevice and corner of the dusty\nold building, and Gervaise recognized Goujet before the forge with two\nother men. She went toward him.",
        "“Madame Gervaise!” he exclaimed in surprise, his face radiant with\njoy, and then seeing his companions laugh and wink, he pushed Etienne\ntoward his mother. “You came to see your boy,” he said; “he does his\nduty like a hero.",
        "“I am glad of it,” she answered, “but what an awful place this is to\nget at!”",
        "And she described her journey, as she called it, and then asked why\nno one seemed to know Etienne there.",
        "“Because,” said the blacksmith, “he is called Zou Zou here, as his\nhair is cut short as a Zouave’s.”",
        "This visit paid by Gervaise to the forge was only the first of many\nothers. She often went on Saturdays when she carried the clean linen\nto Mme Goujet, who still resided in the same house as before. The\nfirst year Gervaise had paid them twenty francs each month, or rather\nthe difference between the amount of their washing, seven or eight\nfrancs, and the twenty which she agreed upon. In this way she had paid\nhalf the money she had borrowed, when one quarter day, not knowing\nto whom to turn, as she had not been able to collect her bills\npunctually, she ran to the Goujets’ and borrowed the amount of her\nrent from them. Twice since she had asked a similar favor, so that the\namount of her indebtedness now stood at four hundred and twenty-five\nfrancs.",
        "Now she no longer paid any cash but did their washing. It was not that\nshe worked less hard or that her business was falling off. Quite the\ncontrary; but money had a way of melting away in her hands, and she\nwas content nowadays if she could only make both ends meet. What was\nthe use of fussing, she thought? If she could manage to live that was\nall that was necessary. She was growing quite stout withal.",
        "Mme Goujet was always kind to Gervaise, not because of any fear of\nlosing her money, but because she really loved her and was afraid of\nher going wrong in some way.",
        "The Saturday after the first visit paid by Gervaise to the forge was\nalso the first of the month. When she reached Mme Goujet’s her basket\nwas so heavy that she panted for two good minutes before she could\nspeak. Every one knows how heavy shirts and such things are.",
        "“Have you brought everything?” asked Mme Goujet, who was very exacting\non this point. She insisted on every piece being returned each week.\nAnother thing she exacted was that the clothes should be brought back\nalways on the same day and hour.",
        "“Everything is here,” answered Gervaise with a smile. “You know I\nnever leave anything behind.”",
        "“That is true,” replied the elder woman. “You have many faults, my\ndear, but not that one yet.”",
        "And while the laundress emptied her basket, laying the linen on\nthe bed, Mme Goujet paid her many compliments. She never burned her\nclothes or ironed off the buttons or tore them, but she did use a\ntrifle too much bluing and made her shirts too stiff.",
        "“Feel,” she said; “it is like pasteboard. My son never complains,\nbut I know he does not like them so.”",
        "“And they shall not be so again,” said Gervaise. “No one ever touches\nany of your things but myself, and I would do them over ten times\nrather than see you dissatisfied.”",
        "She colored as she spoke.",
        "“I have no intention of disparaging your work,” answered Mme Goujet.\n“I never saw anyone who did up laces and embroideries as you do, and\nthe fluting is simply perfect; the only trouble is a little too much\nstarch, my dear. Goujet does not care to look like a fine gentleman.”",
        "She took up her book and drew a pen through the pieces as she spoke.\nEverything was there. She brought out the bundle of soiled clothes.\nGervaise put them in her basket and hesitated.",
        "“Madame Goujet,” she said at last, “if you do not mind I should like\nto have the money for this week’s wash.”",
        "The account this month was larger than usual, ten francs and over.\nMme Goujet looked at her gravely.",
        "“My child,” she said slowly, “it shall be as you wish. I do not refuse\nto give you the money if you desire it; only this is not the way to\nget out of debt. I say this with no unkindness, you understand. Only\nyou must take care.”",
        "Gervaise, with downcast eyes, received the lesson meekly. She needed\nthe ten francs to complete the amount due the coal merchant, she said.",
        "But her friend heard this with a stern countenance and told her\nshe should reduce her expenses, but she did not add that she, too,\nintended to do the same and that in future she should do her washing\nherself, as she had formerly done, if she were to be out of pocket\nthus.",
        "When Gervaise was on the staircase her heart was light, for she cared\nlittle for the reproof now that she had the ten francs in her hand;\nshe was becoming accustomed to paying one debt by contracting another.",
        "Midway on the stairs she met a tall woman coming up with a fresh\nmackerel in her hand, and behold! it was Virginie, the girl whom she\nhad whipped in the lavatory. The two looked each other full in the\nface. Gervaise instinctively closed her eyes, for she thought the girl\nwould slap her in the face with the mackerel. But, no; Virginie gave a\nconstrained smile. Then the laundress, whose huge basket filled up the\nstairway and who did not choose to be outdone in politeness, said:",
        "“I beg your pardon–”",
        "“Pray don’t apologize,” answered Virginie in a stately fashion.",
        "And they stood and talked for a few minutes with not the smallest\nallusion, however, to the past.",
        "Virginie, then about twenty-nine, was really a magnificent-looking\nwoman, head well set on her shoulders and a long, oval face crowned by\nbands of glossy black hair. She told her history in a few brief words.\nShe was married. Had married the previous spring a cabinetmaker who\nhad given up his trade and was hoping to obtain a position on the\npolice force. She had just been out to buy this mackerel for him.",
        "“He adores them,” she said, “and we women spoil our husbands, I think.\nBut come up. We are standing in a draft here.”",
        "When Gervaise had, in her turn, told her story and added that Virginie\nwas living in the very rooms where she had lived and where her child\nwas born, Virginie became still more urgent that she should go up. “It\nis always pleasant to see a place where one has been happy,” she said.\nShe herself had been living on the other side of the water but had got\ntired of it and had moved into these rooms only two weeks ago. She was\nnot settled yet. Her name was Mme Poisson.",
        "“And mine,” said Gervaise, “is Coupeau.”",
        "Gervaise was a little suspicious of all this courtesy. Might not some\nterrible revenge be hidden under it all? And she determined to be well\non her guard. But as Virginie was so polite just now she must be\npolite in her turn.",
        "Poisson, the husband, was a man of thirty-five with a mustache and\nimperial; he was seated at a table near the window, making little\nboxes. His only tools were a penknife, a tiny saw and a gluepot; he\nwas executing the most wonderful and delicate carving, however. He\nnever sold his work but made presents of it to his friends. It amused\nhim while he was awaiting his appointment.",
        "Poisson rose and bowed politely to Gervaise, whom his wife called an\nold friend. But he did not speak, his conversational powers not being\nhis strong point. He cast a plaintive glance at the mackerel, however,\nfrom time to time. Gervaise looked around the room and described her\nfurniture and where it had stood. How strange it was, after losing\nsight of each other so long, that they should occupy the same\napartment! Virginie entered into new details. He had a small\ninheritance from his aunt, and she herself sewed a little, made a\ndress now and then. At the end of a half-hour Gervaise rose to depart;\nVirginie went to the head of the stairs with her, and there both\nhesitated. Gervaise fancied that Virginie wished to say something\nabout Lantier and Adele, but they separated without touching on these\ndisagreeable topics.",
        "This was the beginning of a great friendship. In another week Virginie\ncould not pass the shop without going in, and sometimes she remained\nfor two or three hours. At first Gervaise was very uncomfortable;\nshe thought every time Virginie opened her lips that she would hear\nLantier’s name. Lantier was in her mind all the time she was with Mme\nPoisson. It was a stupid thing to do, after all, for what on earth\ndid she care what had become of Lantier or of Adele? But she was,\nnonetheless, curious to know something about them.",
        "Winter had come, the fourth winter that the Coupeaus had spent in La\nRue de la Goutte-d’Or. This year December and January were especially\nsevere, and after New Year’s the snow lay three weeks in the street\nwithout melting. There was plenty of work for Gervaise, and her shop\nwas delightfully warm and singularly quiet, for the carriages made\nno noise in the snow-covered streets. The laughs and shouts of the\nchildren were almost the only sounds; they had made a long slide and\nenjoyed themselves hugely.",
        "Gervaise took especial pleasure in her coffee at noon. Her apprentices\nhad no reason to complain, for it was hot and strong and unadulterated\nby chicory. On the morning of Twelfth-day the clock had struck twelve\nand then half past, and the coffee was not ready. Gervaise was ironing\nsome muslin curtains. Clemence, with a frightful cold, was, as usual,\nat work on a man’s shirt. Mme Putois was ironing a skirt on a board,\nwith a cloth laid on the floor to prevent the skirt from being soiled.\nMamma Coupeau brought in the coffee, and as each one of the women took\na cup with a sigh of enjoyment the street door opened and Virginie\ncame in with a rush of cold air.",
        "“Heavens!” she cried. “It is awful! My ears are cut off!”",
        "“You have come just in time for a cup of hot coffee,” said Gervaise\ncordially.",
        "“And I shall be only too glad to have it!” answered Virginie with a\nshiver. She had been waiting at the grocer’s, she said, until she was\nchilled through and through. The heat of that room was delicious, and\nthen she stirred her coffee and said she liked the damp, sweet smell\nof the freshly ironed linen. She and Mamma Coupeau were the only ones\nwho had chairs; the others sat on wooden footstools, so low that they\nseemed to be on the floor. Virginie suddenly stooped down to her\nhostess and said with a smile:",
        "“Do you remember that day at the lavatory?”",
        "Gervaise colored; she could not answer. This was just what she had\nbeen dreading. In a moment she felt sure she would hear Lantier’s\nname. She knew it was coming. Virginie drew nearer to her. The\napprentices lingered over their coffee and told each other as they\nlooked stupidly into the street what they would do if they had an\nincome of ten thousand francs. Virginie changed her seat and took\na footstool by the side of Gervaise, who felt weak and cowardly and\nhelpless to change the conversation or to stave off what was coming.\nShe breathlessly awaited the next words, her heart big with an emotion\nwhich she would not acknowledge to herself.",
        "“I do not wish to give you any pain,” said Virginie blandly. “Twenty\ntimes the words have been on my lips, but I hesitated. Pray don’t\nthink I bear you any malice.”",
        "She tipped up her cup and drank the last drop of her coffee. Gervaise,\nwith her heart in her mouth, waited in a dull agony of suspense,\nasking herself if Virginie could have forgiven the insult in the\nlavatory. There was a glitter in the woman’s eyes she did not like.",
        "“You had an excuse,” Virginie added as she placed her cup on the\ntable. “You had been abominably treated. I should have killed\nsomeone.” And then, dropping her little-affected tone, she continued\nmore rapidly:",
        "“They were not happy, I assure you, not at all happy. They lived in a\ndirty street, where the mud was up to their knees. I went to breakfast\nwith them two days after he left you and found them in the height of\na quarrel. You know that Adele is a wretch. She is my sister, to be\nsure, but she is a wretch all the same. As to Lantier–well, you know\nhim, so I need not describe him. But for a yes or a no he would not\nhesitate to thresh any woman that lives. Oh, they had a beautiful\ntime! Their quarrels were heard all over the neighborhood. One day\nthe police were sent for, they made such a hubbub.”",
        "She talked on and on, telling things that were enough to make the hair\nstand up on one’s head. Gervaise listened, as pale as death, with a\nnervous trembling of her lips which might have been taken for a smile.\nFor seven years she had never heard Lantier’s name, and she would\nnot have believed that she could have felt any such overwhelming\nagitation. She could no longer be jealous of Adele, but she smiled\ngrimly as she thought of the blows she had received in her turn from\nLantier, and she would have listened for hours to all that Virginia\nhad to tell, but she did not ask a question for some time. Finally\nshe said:",
        "“And do they still live in that same place?”",
        "“No indeed! But I have not told you all yet. They separated a week\nago.”",
        "“Separated!” exclaimed the clearstarcher.",
        "“Who is separated?” asked Clemence, interrupting her conversation\nwith Mamma Coupeau.",
        "“No one,” said Virginie, “or at least no one whom you know.”",
        "As she spoke she looked at Gervaise and seemed to take a positive\ndelight in disturbing her still more. She suddenly asked her what\nshe would do or say if Lantier should suddenly make his appearance,\nfor men were so strange; no one could ever tell what they would do.\nLantier was quite capable of returning to his old love. Then Gervaise\ninterrupted her and rose to the occasion. She answered with grave\ndignity that she was married now and that if Lantier should appear\nshe would ask him to leave. There could never be anything more between\nthem, not even the most distant acquaintance.",
        "“I know very well,” she said, “that Etienne belongs to him, and if\nLantier desires to see his son I shall place no obstacle in his way.\nBut as to myself, Madame Poisson, he shall never touch my little\nfinger again! It is finished.”",
        "As she uttered these last words she traced a cross in the air to seal\nher oath, and as if desirous to put an end to the conversation, she\ncalled out to her women:",
        "“Do you think the ironing will be done today if you sit still? To\nwork! To work!”",
        "The women did not move; they were lulled to apathy by the heat, and\nGervaise herself found it very difficult to resume her labors. Her\ncurtains had dried in all this time, and some coffee had been spilled\non them, and she must wash out the spots.",
        "“Au revoir!” said Virginie. “I came out to buy a half pound of cheese.\nPoisson will think I am frozen to death!”",
        "The better part of the day was now gone, and it was this way every\nday, for the shop was the refuge and haunt of all the chilly people\nin the neighborhood. Gervaise liked the reputation of having the\nmost comfortable room in the _Quartier_, and she held her receptions,\nas the Lorilleux and Boche clique said, with a sniff of disdain. She\nwould, in fact, have liked to bring in the very poor whom she saw\nshivering outside. She became very friendly toward a journeyman\npainter, an old man of seventy, who lived in a loft of the house,\nwhere he shivered with cold and hunger. He had lost his three sons\nin the Crimea, and for two years his hand had been so cramped by\nrheumatism that he could not hold a brush.",
        "Whenever Gervaise saw Father Bru she called him in, made a place for\nhim near the stove and gave him some bread and cheese. Father Bru,\nwith his white beard and his face wrinkled like an old apple, sat\nin silent content for hours at a time, enjoying the warmth and the\ncrackling of the coke.",
        "“What are you thinking about?” Gervaise would say gaily.",
        "“Of nothing–of all sorts of things,” he would reply with a dazed air.",
        "The workwomen laughed and thought it a good joke to ask if he were in\nlove. He paid little heed to them but relapsed into silent thought.",
        "From this time Virginie often spoke to Gervaise of Lantier, and one\nday she said she had just met him. But as the clearstarcher made no\nreply Virginie then said no more. But on the next day she returned to\nthe subject and told her that he had talked long and tenderly of her.\nGervaise was much troubled by these whispered conversations in the\ncorner of her shop. The name of Lantier made her faint and sick at\nheart. She believed herself to be an honest woman. She meant, in every\nway, to do right and to shun the wrong, because she felt that only in\ndoing so could she be happy. She did not think much of Coupeau because\nshe was conscious of no shortcomings toward him. But she thought of\nher friend at the forge, and it seemed to her that this return of her\ninterest in Lantier, faint and undecided as it was, was an infidelity\nto Goujet and to that tender friendship which had become so very\nprecious to her. Her heart was much troubled in these days. She dwelt\non that time when her first lover left her. She imagined another day\nwhen, quitting Adele, he might return to her–with that old familiar\ntrunk.",
        "When she went into the street it was with a spasm of terror. She\nfancied that every step behind her was Lantier’s. She dared not\nlook around lest his hand should glide about her waist. He might\nbe watching for her at any time. He might come to her door in the\nafternoon, and this idea brought a cold sweat to her forehead, because\nhe would certainly kiss her on her ear as he had often teased her by\ndoing in the years gone by. It was this kiss she dreaded. Its dull\nreverberation deafened her to all outside sounds, and she could hear\nonly the beatings of her own heart. When these terrors assailed her\nthe forge was her only asylum, from whence she returned smiling and\nserene, feeling that Goujet, whose sonorous hammer had put all her\nbad dreams to flight, would protect her always.",
        "What a happy season this was after all! The clearstarcher always\ncarried a certain basket of clothes to her customer each week, because\nit gave her a pretext for going into the forge, as it was on her\nway. As soon as she turned the corner of the street in which it was\nsituated she felt as lighthearted as if she were going to the country.\nThe black charcoal dust in the road, the black smoke rising slowly\nfrom the chimneys, interested and pleased her as much as a mossy path\nthrough the woods. Afar off the forge was red even at midday, and\nher heart danced in time with the hammers. Goujet was expecting her\nand making more noise than usual, that she might hear him at a great\ndistance. She gave Etienne a light tap on his cheek and sat quietly\nwatching these two–this man and boy, who were so dear to her–for an\nhour without speaking. When the sparks touched her tender skin she\nrather enjoyed the sensation. He, in his turn, was fully aware of\nthe happiness she felt in being there, and he reserved the work which\nrequired skill for the time when she could look on in wonder and\nadmiration. It was an idyl that they were unconsciously enacting all\nthat spring, and when Gervaise returned to her home it was in a spirit\nof sweet content.",
        "By degrees her unreasonable fears of Lantier were conquered. Coupeau\nwas behaving very badly at this time, and one evening as she passed\nthe Assommoir she was certain she saw him drinking with Mes-Bottes.\nShe hurried on lest she should seem to be watching him. But as she\nhastened she looked over her shoulder. Yes, it was Coupeau who was\ntossing down a glass of liquor with an air as if it were no new\nthing. He had lied to her then; he did drink brandy. She was in utter\ndespair, and all her old horror of brandy returned. Wine she could\nhave forgiven–wine was good for a working man–liquor, on the\ncontrary, was his ruin and took from him all desire for the food that\nnourished and gave him strength for his daily toil. Why did not the\ngovernment interfere and prevent the manufacture of such pernicious\nthings?",
        "When she reached her home she found the whole house in confusion. Her\nemployees had left their work and were in the courtyard. She asked\nwhat the matter was.",
        "“It is Father Bijard beating his wife; he is as drunk as a fool, and\nhe drove her up the stairs to her room, where he is murdering her.\nJust listen!”",
        "Gervaise flew up the stairs. She was very fond of Mme Bijard, who was\nher laundress and whose courage and industry she greatly admired. On\nthe sixth floor a little crowd was assembled. Mme Boche stood at an\nopen door.",
        "“Have done!” she cried. “Have done, or the police will be summoned.”",
        "No one dared enter the room, because Bijard was well known to be like\na madman when he was tipsy. He was rarely thoroughly sober, and on the\noccasional days when he condescended to work he always had a bottle\nof brandy at his side. He rarely ate anything, and if a match had been\ntouched to his mouth he would have taken fire like a torch.",
        "“Would you let her be killed?” exclaimed Gervaise, trembling from head\nto foot, and she entered the attic room, which was very clean and very\nbare, for the man had sold the very sheets off the bed to satisfy his\nmad passion for drink. In this terrible struggle for life the table\nhad been thrown over, and the two chairs also. On the floor lay the\npoor woman with her skirts drenched as she had come from the washtub,\nher hair streaming over her bloody face, uttering low groans at each\nkick the brute gave her.",
        "The neighbors whispered to each other that she had refused to give\nhim the money she had earned that day. Boche called up the staircase\nto his wife:",
        "“Come down, I say; let him kill her if he will. It will only make one\nfool the less in the world!”",
        "Father Bru followed Gervaise into the room, and the two expostulated\nwith the madman. But he turned toward them, pale and threatening;\na white foam glistened on his lips, and in his faded eyes there was a\nmurderous expression. He grasped Father Bru by the shoulder and threw\nhim over the table and shook Gervaise until her teeth chattered and\nthen returned to his wife, who lay motionless, with her mouth wide\nopen and her eyes closed; and during this frightful scene little\nLalie, four years old, was in the corner, looking on at the murder\nof her mother. The child’s arms were round her sister Henriette,\na baby who had just been weaned. She stood with a sad, solemn face\nand serious, melancholy eyes but shed no tears.",
        "When Bijard slipped and fell Gervaise and Father Bru helped the poor\ncreature to her feet, who then burst into sobs. Lalie went to her\nside, but she did not cry, for the child was already habituated to\nsuch scenes. And as Gervaise went down the stairs she was haunted by\nthe strange look of resignation and courage in Lalie’s eyes; it was\nan expression belonging to maturity and experience rather than to\nchildhood.",
        "“Your husband is on the other side of the street,” said Clemence\nas soon as she saw Gervaise; “he is as tipsy as possible!”",
        "Coupeau reeled in, breaking a square of glass with his shoulder as\nhe missed the doorway. He was not tipsy but drunk, with his teeth set\nfirmly together and a pinched expression about the nose. And Gervaise\ninstantly knew that it was the liquor of the Assommoir which had\nvitiated his blood. She tried to smile and coaxed him to go to bed.\nBut he shook her off and as he passed her gave her a blow.",
        "He was just like the other–the beast upstairs who was now snoring,\ntired out by beating his wife. She was chilled to the heart and\ndesperate. Were all men alike? She thought of Lantier and of her\nhusband and wondered if there was no happiness in the world.",
