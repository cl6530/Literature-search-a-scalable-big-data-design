        "I take occasion at this time to ask the American people as one man, what\nare we to do to prevent the spread of the most insidious and disagreeable\ndisease known as hydrophobia? When a fellow-being has to be smothered, as\nwas the case the other day right here in our fair land, a land where\ntyrant foot hath never trod nor bigot forged a chain, we look anxiously\ninto each other’s faces and inquire, what shall we do?",
        "Shall we go to France at a great expense and fill our systems full of dog\nvirus and then return to our glorious land, where we may fork over that\nvirus to posterity and thus mix up French hydrophobia with the navy-blue\nblood of free-born American citizens?",
        "I wot not.",
        "If I knew that would be my last wot I would not change it. That is just\nwot it would be.",
        "But again.",
        "What shall we do to avoid getting impregnated with the American dog and\nthen saturating our systems with the alien dog of Paris?",
        "It is a serious matter, and if we do not want to play the Desdemona act we\nmust take some timely precautions. What must those precautions be?",
        "Did it ever occur to the average thinking mind that we might squeeze along\nfor weeks without a dog? Whole families have existed for years after being\ndeprived of dogs. Look at the wealthy of our land. They go on comfortably\nthrough life and die at last with the unanimous consent of their heirs\ndogless.",
        "Then why cannot the poor gradually taper off on dogs? They ought not to\nstop all of a sudden, but they could leave off a dog at a time until at\nlast they overcame the pernicious habit.",
        "I saw a man in St. Paul last week who was once poor, and so owned seven\nvariegated dogs. He was confirmed in that habit. But he summoned all his\nwill-power at last and said he would shake off these dogs and become a\nman. He did so, and to-day he owns a city lot in St. Paul, and seems to be\nthe picture of health.",
        "The trouble about maintaining a dog is that he may go on for years in a\nquiet, gentlemanly way, winning the regard of all who know him, and then\nall of a sudden he may hydrophobe in the most violent manner. Not only\nthat, but he may do so while we have company. He may also bite our twins\nor the twins of our warmest friends. He may bite us now and we may laugh\nat it, but in five years from now, while we are delivering a humorous\nlecture, we may burst forth into the audience and bite a beautiful young\nlady in the parquet or on the ear.",
        "It is a solemn thing to think of, fellow-citizens, and I appeal to those\nwho may read this, as a man who may not live to see a satisfactory\npolitical reform–I appeal to you to refrain from the dog. He is purely\nornamental. We may love a good dog, but we ought to love our children\nmore. It would be a very, very noble and expensive dog that I would agree\nto feed with my only son.",
        "I know that we gradually become attached to a good dog, but some day he\nmay become attached to us, and what can be sadder than the sight of a\nleading citizen drawing a reluctant mad dog down the street by main\nstrength and the seat of his pantaloons? (I mean his own, not the dog’s\npants. This joke will appear in book form in April. The book will be very\nreadable, and there will be another joke in it also. eod tf.)",
        "I have said a good deal about the dog, pro and con, and I am not a rabid\ndog abolitionist, for no one loves to have his clear-cut features licked\nby the warm, wet tongue of a noble dog any more than I do, but rather than\nsee hydrophobia become a national characteristic or a leading industry\nhere, I would forego the dog.",
        "Perhaps all men are that way, however. When they get a little forehanded\nthey forget that they were once poor, and owned dogs. If so, I do not wish\nto be unfair. I want to be just, and I believe I am. Let us yield up our\ndogs and take the affection that we would otherwise bestow on them on some\nhuman being. I have tried it and it works well. There are thousands of\npeople in the world, of both sexes, who are pining and starving for the\nlove and money that we daily shower on the dog.",
        "If the dog would be kind enough to refrain from introducing his justly\ncelebrated virus into the person of those only who kiss him on the cold,\nmoist nose, it would be all right; but when a dog goes mad he is very\nimpulsive, and he may bestow himself on an obscure man. So I feel a little\nnervous myself.",
