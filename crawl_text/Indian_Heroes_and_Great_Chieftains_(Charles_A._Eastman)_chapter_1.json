        "EVERY age, every race, has its leaders and heroes.  There were over\nsixty distinct tribes of Indians on this continent, each of which\nboasted its notable men.  The names and deeds of some of these men\nwill live in American history, yet in the true sense they are\nunknown, because misunderstood.  I should like to present some of\nthe greatest chiefs of modern times in the light of the native\ncharacter and ideals, believing that the American people will\ngladly do them tardy justice.",
        "It is matter of history that the Sioux nation, to which I\nbelong, was originally friendly to the Caucasian peoples which it\nmet in succession-first, to the south the Spaniards; then the\nFrench, on the Mississippi River and along the Great Lakes; later\nthe English, and finally the Americans.  This powerful tribe then\nroamed over the whole extent of the Mississippi valley, between\nthat river and the Rockies.  Their usages and government united the\nvarious bands more closely than was the case with many of the\nneighboring tribes.",
        "During the early part of the nineteenth century, chiefs such\nas Wabashaw, Redwing, and Little Six among the eastern Sioux,\nConquering Bear, Man-Afraid-of-His-Horse, and Hump of the western\nbands, were the last of the old type.  After these, we have a\ncoterie of new leaders, products of the new conditions brought\nabout by close contact with the conquering race.",
        "This distinction must be borne in mind – that while the early\nchiefs were spokesmen and leaders in the simplest sense, possessing\nno real authority, those who headed their tribes during the\ntransition period were more or less rulers and more or less\npoliticians.  It is a singular fact that many of the “chiefs”, well\nknown as such to the American public, were not chiefs at all\naccording to the accepted usages of their tribesmen.  Their\nprominence was simply the result of an abnormal situation, in which\nrepresentatives of the United States Government made use of them\nfor a definite purpose.  In a few cases, where a chief met with a\nviolent death, some ambitious man has taken advantage of the\nconfusion to thrust himself upon the tribe and, perhaps with\noutside help, has succeeded in usurping the leadership.",
        "Red Cloud was born about 1820 near the forks of the Platte\nRiver.  He was one of a family of nine children whose father, an\nable and respected warrior, reared his son under the old Spartan\nregime.  The young Red Cloud is said to have been a fine horseman,\nable to swim across the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers, of high\nbearing and unquestionable courage, yet invariably gentle and\ncourteous in everyday life.  This last trait, together with a\nsingularly musical and agreeable voice, has always been\ncharacteristic of the man.",
        "When he was about six years old, his father gave him a\nspirited colt, and said to him:",
        "“My son, when you are able to sit quietly upon the back of\nthis colt without saddle or bridle, I shall be glad, for the boy\nwho can win a wild creature and learn to use it will as a man be\nable to win and rule men.”",
        "The little fellow, instead of going for advice and help to his\ngrandfather, as most Indian boys would have done, began quietly to\npractice throwing the lariat.  In a little while he was able to\nlasso the colt.  He was dragged off his feet at once, but hung on,\nand finally managed to picket him near the teepee.  When the big\nboys drove the herd of ponies to water, he drove his colt with the\nrest.  Presently the pony became used to him and allowed himself to\nbe handled.  The boy began to ride him bareback; he was thrown many\ntimes, but persisted until he could ride without even a lariat,\nsitting with arms folded and guiding the animal by the movements of\nhis body.  From that time on he told me that he broke all his own\nponies, and before long his father’s as well.",
        "The old men, his contemporaries, have often related to me how\nRed Cloud was always successful in the hunt because his horses were\nso well broken.  At the age of nine, he began to ride his father’s\npack pony upon the buffalo hunt.  He was twelve years old, he told\nme, when he was first permitted to take part in the chase, and\nfound to his great mortification that none of his arrows penetrated\nmore than a few inches.  Excited to recklessness, he whipped his\nhorse nearer the fleeing buffalo, and before his father knew what\nhe was about, he had seized one of the protruding arrows and tried\nto push it deeper.  The furious animal tossed his massive head\nsidewise, and boy and horse were whirled into the air. \nFortunately, the boy was thrown on the farther side of his pony,\nwhich received the full force of the second attack.  The thundering\nhoofs of the stampeded herd soon passed them by, but the wounded\nand maddened buffalo refused to move, and some critical moments\npassed before Red Cloud’s father succeeded in attracting its\nattention so that the boy might spring to his feet and run for his\nlife.",
        "I once asked Red Cloud if he could recall having ever been\nafraid, and in reply he told me this story.  He was about sixteen\nyears old and had already been once or twice upon the warpath, when\none fall his people were hunting in the Big Horn country, where\nthey might expect trouble at any moment with the hostile Crows or\nShoshones.  Red Cloud had followed a single buffalo bull into the\nBad Lands and was out of sight and hearing of his companions.  When\nhe had brought down his game, he noted carefully every feature of\nhis surroundings so that he might at once detect anything unusual,\nand tied his horse with a long lariat to the horn of the dead\nbison, while skinning and cutting up the meat so as to pack it to\ncamp.  Every few minutes he paused in his work to scrutinize the\nlandscape, for he had a feeling that danger was not far off.",
        "Suddenly, almost over his head, as it seemed, he heard a\ntremendous war whoop, and glancing sidewise, thought he beheld\nthe charge of an overwhelming number of warriors.  He tried\ndesperately to give the usual undaunted war whoop in reply, but\ninstead a yell of terror burst from his lips, his legs gave way\nunder him, and he fell in a heap.  When he realized, the next\ninstant, that the war whoop was merely the sudden loud whinnying of\nhis own horse, and the charging army a band of fleeing elk, he was\nso ashamed of himself that he never forgot the incident, although\nup to that time he had never mentioned it.  His subsequent career\nwould indicate that the lesson was well learned.",
        "The future leader was still a very young man when he joined a\nwar party against the Utes.  Having pushed eagerly forward on the\ntrail, he found himself far in advance of his companions as night\ncame on, and at the same time rain began to fall heavily.  Among\nthe scattered scrub pines, the lone warrior found a natural cave,\nand after a hasty examination, he decided to shelter there for the\nnight.",
        "Scarcely had he rolled himself in his blanket when he heard a\nslight rustling at the entrance, as if some creature were preparing\nto share his retreat.  It was pitch dark.  He could see nothing, but\njudged that it must be either a man or a grizzly.  There was not\nroom to draw a bow.  It must be between knife and knife, or between\nknife and claws, he said to himself.",
        "The intruder made no search but quietly lay down in the\nopposite corner of the cave.  Red Cloud remained perfectly still,\nscarcely breathing, his hand upon his knife.  Hour after hour he\nlay broad awake, while many thoughts passed through his brain. \nSuddenly, without warning, he sneezed, and instantly a strong man\nsprang to a sitting posture opposite.  The first gray of morning\nwas creeping into their rocky den, and behold! a Ute hunter sat\nbefore him.",
        "Desperate as the situation appeared, it was not without a grim\nhumor.  Neither could afford to take his eyes from the other’s; the\ntension was great, till at last a smile wavered over the\nexpressionless face of the Ute.  Red Cloud answered the smile, and\nin that instant a treaty of peace was born between them.",
        "“Put your knife in its sheath.  I shall do so also, and we\nwill smoke together,” signed Red Cloud.  The other assented gladly,\nand they ratified thus the truce which assured to each a safe\nreturn to his friends.  Having finished their smoke, they shook\nhands and separated.  Neither had given the other any information. \nRed Cloud returned to his party and told his story, adding that he\nhad divulged nothing and had nothing to report.  Some were inclined\nto censure him for not fighting, but he was sustained by a majority\nof the warriors, who commended his self-restraint.  In a day or two\nthey discovered the main camp of the enemy and fought a remarkable\nbattle, in which Red Cloud especially distinguished himself",
        "The Sioux were now entering upon the most stormy period of\ntheir history.  The old things were fast giving place to new.  The\nyoung men, for the first time engaging in serious and destructive\nwarfare with the neighboring tribes, armed with the deadly weapons\nfurnished by the white man, began to realize that they must soon\nenter upon a desperate struggle for their ancestral hunting\ngrounds.  The old men had been innocently cultivating the\nfriendship of the stranger, saying among themselves, “Surely there\nis land enough for all!”",
        "Red Cloud was a modest and little known man of about\ntwenty-eight years, when General Harney called all the western\nbands of Sioux together at Fort Laramie, Wyoming, for the purpose\nof securing an agreement and right of way through their territory. \nThe Ogallalas held aloof from this proposal, but Bear Bull, an\nOgallala chief, after having been plied with whisky, undertook to\ndictate submission to the rest of the clan.  Enraged by failure, he\nfired upon a group of his own tribesmen, and Red Cloud’s father and\nbrother fell dead.  According to Indian custom, it fell to him to\navenge the deed.  Calmly, without uttering a word, he faced old\nBear Bull and his son, who attempted to defend his father, and shot\nthem both.  He did what he believed to be his duty, and the whole\nband sustained him.  Indeed, the tragedy gave the young man at once\na certain standing, as one who not only defended his people against\nenemies from without, but against injustice and aggression within\nthe tribe.  From this time on he was a recognized leader.",
        "Man-Afraid-of-His-Horse, then head chief of the Ogallalas,\ntook council with Red Cloud in all important matters, and the young\nwarrior rapidly advanced in authority and influence.  In 1854, when\nhe was barely thirty-five years old, the various bands were again\nencamped near Fort Laramie.  A Mormon emigrant train, moving\nwestward, left a footsore cow behind, and the young men killed her\nfor food.  The next day, to their astonishment, an officer with\nthirty men appeared at the Indian camp and demanded of old\nConquering Bear that they be given up.  The chief in vain protested\nthat it was all a mistake and offered to make reparation.  It would\nseem that either the officer was under the influence of liquor, or\nelse had a mind to bully the Indians, for he would accept neither\nexplanation nor payment, but demanded point-blank that the young\nmen who had killed the cow be delivered up to summary punishment. \nThe old chief refused to be intimidated and was shot dead on the\nspot.  Not one soldier ever reached the gate of Fort Laramie!  Here\nRed Cloud led the young Ogallalas, and so intense was the feeling\nthat they even killed the half-breed interpreter.",
        "Curiously enough, there was no attempt at retaliation on the\npart of the army, and no serious break until 1860, when the Sioux\nwere involved in troubles with the Cheyennes and Arapahoes.  In\n1862, a grave outbreak was precipitated by the eastern Sioux in\nMinnesota under Little Crow, in which the western bands took no\npart.  Yet this event ushered in a new period for their race.  The\nsurveyors of the Union Pacific were laying out the proposed road\nthrough the heart of the southern buffalo country, the rendezvous\nof Ogallalas, Brules, Arapahoes, Comanches, and Pawnees, who\nfollowed the buffalo as a means of livelihood.  To be sure, most of\nthese tribes were at war with one another, yet during the summer\nmonths they met often to proclaim a truce and hold joint councils\nand festivities, which were now largely turned into discussions of\nthe common enemy.  It became evident, however, that some of the\nsmaller and weaker tribes were inclined to welcome the new order of\nthings, recognizing that it was the policy of the government to put\nan end to tribal warfare.",
        "Red Cloud’s position was uncompromisingly against submission. \nHe made some noted speeches in this line, one of which was repeated\nto me by an old man who had heard and remembered it with the\nremarkable verbal memory of an Indian.",
        "“Friends,” said Red Cloud, “it has been our misfortune to\nwelcome the white man.  We have been deceived.  He brought with him\nsome shining things that pleased our eyes; he brought weapons more\neffective than our own: above all, he brought the spirit water that\nmakes one forget for a time old age, weakness, and sorrow.  But I\nwish to say to you that if you would possess these things for\nyourselves, you must begin anew and put away the wisdom of your\nfathers.  You must lay up food, and forget the hungry.  When your\nhouse is built, your storeroom filled, then look around for a\nneighbor whom you can take at a disadvantage, and seize all that he\nhas!  Give away only what you do not want; or rather, do not part\nwith any of your possessions unless in exchange for another’s.",
        "“My countrymen, shall the glittering trinkets of this rich\nman, his deceitful drink that overcomes the mind, shall these\nthings tempt us to give up our homes, our hunting grounds, and the\nhonorable teaching of our old men?  Shall we permit ourselves to be\ndriven to and fro – to be herded like the cattle of the white man?”",
        "His next speech that has been remembered was made in 1866,\njust before the attack on Fort Phil Kearny.  The tension of feeling\nagainst the invaders had now reached its height.  There was no\ndissenting voice in the council upon the Powder River, when it was\ndecided to oppose to the uttermost the evident purpose of the\ngovernment.  Red Cloud was not altogether ignorant of the numerical\nstrength and the resourcefulness of the white man, but he was\ndetermined to face any odds rather than submit.",
        "“Hear ye, Dakotas!” he exclaimed.  “When the Great Father at\nWashington sent us his chief soldier [General Harney] to ask for a\npath through our hunting grounds, a way for his iron road to the\nmountains and the western sea, we were told that they wished merely\nto pass through our country, not to tarry among us, but to seek for\ngold in the far west.  Our old chiefs thought to show their\nfriendship and good will, when they allowed this dangerous snake in\nour midst.  They promised to protect the wayfarers.",
        "“Yet before the ashes of the council fire are cold, the Great\nFather is building his forts among us.  You have heard the sound of\nthe white soldier’s ax upon the Little Piney.  His presence here is\nan insult and a threat.  It is an insult to the spirits of our\nancestors.  Are we then to give up their sacred graves to be plowed\nfor corn?  Dakotas, I am for war!”",
        "In less than a week after this speech, the Sioux advanced upon\nFort Phil Kearny, the new sentinel that had just taken her place\nupon the farthest frontier, guarding the Oregon Trail.  Every\ndetail of the attack had been planned with care, though not without\nheated discussion, and nearly every well-known Sioux chief had\nagreed in striking the blow.  The brilliant young war leader, Crazy\nHorse, was appointed to lead the charge.  His lieutenants were\nSword, Hump, and Dull Knife, with Little Chief of the Cheyennes,\nwhile the older men acted as councilors.  Their success was\ninstantaneous.  In less than half an hour, they had cut down nearly\na hundred men under Captain Fetterman, whom they drew out of the\nfort by a ruse and then annihilated.",
        "Instead of sending troops to punish, the government sent a\ncommission to treat with the Sioux.  The result was the famous\ntreaty of 1868, which Red Cloud was the last to sign, having\nrefused to do so until all of the forts within their territory\nshould be vacated.  All of his demands were acceded to, the new\nroad abandoned, the garrisons withdrawn, and in the new treaty it\nwas distinctly stated that the Black Hills and the Big Horn were\nIndian country, set apart for their perpetual occupancy, and that\nno white man should enter that region without the consent of the\nSioux.",
        "Scarcely was this treaty signed, however, when gold was\ndiscovered in the Black Hills, and the popular cry was: “Remove\nthe Indians!”  This was easier said than done.  That very territory\nhad just been solemnly guaranteed to them forever: yet how stem the\nirresistible rush for gold?  The government, at first, entered some\nsmall protest, just enough to “save its face” as the saying is; but\nthere was no serious attempt to prevent the wholesale violation of\nthe treaty.  It was this state of affairs that led to the last\ngreat speech made by Red Cloud, at a gathering upon the Little\nRosebud River.  It is brief, and touches upon the hopelessness of\ntheir future as a race.  He seems at about this time to have\nreached the conclusion that resistance could not last much longer;\nin fact, the greater part of the Sioux nation was already under\ngovernment control.",
        "“We are told,” said he, “that Spotted Tail has consented to be\nthe Beggars’ Chief.  Those Indians who go over to the white man can\nbe nothing but beggars, for he respects only riches, and how can an\nIndian be a rich man?  He cannot without ceasing to be an Indian. \nAs for me, I have listened patiently to the promises of the Great\nFather, but his memory is short.  I am now done with him.  This is\nall I have to say.”",
        "The wilder bands separated soon after this council, to follow\nthe drift of the buffalo, some in the vicinity of the Black Hills\nand others in the Big Horn region.  Small war parties came down\nfrom time to time upon stray travelers, who received no mercy at\ntheir hands, or made dashes upon neighboring forts.  Red Cloud\nclaimed the right to guard and hold by force, if need be, all this\nterritory which had been conceded to his people by the treaty of\n1868.  The land became a very nest of outlawry.  Aside from\norganized parties of prospectors, there were bands of white horse\nthieves and desperadoes who took advantage of the situation to\nplunder immigrants and Indians alike.",
        "An attempt was made by means of military camps to establish\ncontrol and force all the Indians upon reservations, and another\ncommission was sent to negotiate their removal to Indian Territory,\nbut met with an absolute refusal.  After much guerrilla warfare, an\nimportant military campaign against the Sioux was set on foot in\n1876, ending in Custer’s signal defeat upon the Little Big Horn.",
        "In this notable battle, Red Cloud did not participate in\nperson, nor in the earlier one with Crook upon the Little Rosebud,\nbut he had a son in both fights.  He was now a councilor rather\nthan a warrior, but his young men were constantly in the field,\nwhile Spotted Tail had definitely surrendered and was in close\ntouch with representatives of the government.",
        "But the inevitable end was near.  One morning in the fall of\n1876 Red Cloud was surrounded by United States troops under the\ncommand of Colonel McKenzie, who disarmed his people and brought\nthem into Fort Robinson, Nebraska.  Thence they were removed to the\nPine Ridge agency, where he lived for more than thirty years as a\n“reservation Indian.”  In order to humiliate him further,\ngovernment authorities proclaimed the more tractable Spotted Tail\nhead chief of the Sioux.  Of course, Red Cloud’s own people never\nrecognized any other chief.",
        "In 1880 he appealed to Professor Marsh, of Yale, head of a\nscientific expedition to the Bad Lands, charging certain frauds at\nthe agency and apparently proving his case; at any rate the matter\nwas considered worthy of official investigation.  In 1890-1891,\nduring the “Ghost Dance craze” and the difficulties that followed,\nhe was suspected of collusion with the hostiles, but he did not\njoin them openly, and nothing could be proved against him.  He was\nalready an old man, and became almost entirely blind before his\ndeath in 1909 in his ninetieth year.",
        "His private life was exemplary.  He was faithful to one wife\nall his days, and was a devoted father to his children.  He was\nambitious for his only son, known as Jack Red Cloud, and much\ndesired him to be a great warrior.  He started him on the warpath\nat the age of fifteen, not then realizing that the days of Indian\nwarfare were well-nigh at an end.",
        "Among latter-day chiefs, Red Cloud was notable as a quiet man,\nsimple and direct in speech, courageous in action, an ardent lover\nof his country, and possessed in a marked degree of the manly\nqualities characteristic of the American Indian in his best days.",
