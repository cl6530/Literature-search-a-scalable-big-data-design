        "\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865)\n16th President of the United States",
        "\n\n",
        "There are two things which made the campaign of 1860 paradoxical, so to\nspeak. One was that the nomination was equivalent to an election,\nunless unforeseen difficulties should arise. The other was that this\nelection might be used by the extreme Southern democrats as an excuse\nfor precipitating war. They threatened this.",
        "After the nomination the committee of the convention duly called on\nLincoln to give him the formal notification. This committee included\nsome names that were at that time, and still more so later, widely\nknown. Among them were three from Massachusetts: Ashmun, then Governor,\nand chairman of the Chicago convention, Bowles, editor of the\nSpringfield Republican, and Boutwell. There were also Gideon\nWelles, Carl Schurz, Francis P. Blair, and W. M. Evarts. The chairman\nof this committee notified Lincoln in a brief speech, to which he\nresponded with equal brevity. Even these few words impressed his\nhearers with a sense of dignity and manliness which they were only too\nglad to perceive. Said Mr. Boutwell: “Why, sir, they told me he was a\nrough diamond. Nothing could have been in better taste than that\nspeech.”",
        "One who had opposed Lincoln in the convention said: “We might have done\na more daring thing [than nominate him], but we certainly could not\nhave done a better thing.” Carl Schurz evidently shared this feeling.",
        "Judge Kelly of Pennsylvania was a very tall man and was proud of the\nfact. During the brief ceremony he and Lincoln had been measuring each\nother with the eye. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the President-\nelect demanded:",
        "“What’s your height?”",
        "“Six feet three. What is yours, Mr. Lincoln?”",
        "“Six feet four.”",
        "“Then,” said the judge, “Pennsylvania bows to Illinois. My dear man,\nfor many years my heart has been aching for a President I could look\nup to, and I’ve found him at last in the land where we thought\nthere were none but little giants.”",
        "The general feeling of the committee was that the convention had made\nno mistake. This feeling quickly spread throughout the entire party.\nSome of Seward’s friends wanted him to run on an independent ticket. It\nis to his credit that he scouted the idea. The democrats, at least the\nopponents of Lincoln, were divided into three camps, The first was the\nregular party, headed by Douglas. The second was the bolting party of\nfire-eaters, who nominated Breckinridge. The third was the party that\nnominated Bell and Everett. This was wittily called the Kangaroo\nticket, because the tail was the most important part. Lincoln’s popular\nvote at the November election was about forty per cent, of the total.\nIt was plain that if his supporters held together and his opponents\nwere divided, he could readily get a plurality. There were attempts on\nthe part of the opponents of Lincoln to run fusion tickets in New York,\nNew Jersey, and Pennsylvania, so as to divert the electoral votes from\nhim; but these came to nothing more than that New Jersey diverted three\nof her seven electoral votes.",
        "A curious feature of the campaign was that all four candidates declared\nemphatically for the Union. Breckinridge, who was the candidate of the\nSouthern disunionists, wrote; “The Constitution and the equality of the\nstates, these are symbols of everlasting union.” Lincoln himself could\nhardly have used stronger language. Some people were doubtless deceived\nby these protestations, but not Douglas. He declared: “I do not believe\nthat every Breckinridge man is a disunionist, but I do believe that\nevery disunionist in America is a Breckinridge man.” During the period\nof nearly six months between nomination and election, Lincoln continued\nsimple, patient, wise. He was gratified by the nomination. He was not\nelated, for he was not an ambitious man. On the contrary, he felt the\nburden of responsibility. He was a far-seeing statesman, and no man\nmore distinctly realized the coming tragedy. He felt the call of duty,\nnot to triumph but to sacrifice. This was the cause of his seriousness\nand gravity of demeanor.",
        "There was no unnecessary change in his simple manners and unpretentious\nmethod of living. Friends and neighbors came, and he was glad to see\nthem. He answered the door-bell himself and accompanied visitors to the\ndoor. Some of his friends, desiring to save his strength in these\nlittle matters, procured a negro valet, Thomas by name. But Abraham\ncontinued to do most of the duties that by right belonged to Thomas.",
        "Some one sent him a silk hat, that he might go to Washington with head-\ngear equal to the occasion. A farmer’s wife knit him a pair of yarn\nstockings. Hundreds of such attentions, kind in intent, grotesque in\nappearance, he received with that kindness which is the soul of\ncourtesy. There was a woman at whose modest farmhouse he had once dined\non a bowl of bread and milk, because he had arrived after everything\nelse had been eaten up. She came into Springfield to renew her\napologies and to remind him that he had said that that repast was “good\nenough for the President.” While he commanded the respect of Bryant,\nSchurz, Boutwell, and such, he was at the same time the idol of the\nplain people, whom he always loved. He once said he thought the Lord\nparticularly loved plain people, for he had made so many of them.",
        "Shortly after his nomination he was present at a party in Chicago. A\nlittle girl approached timidly. He asked, encouragingly, if he could do\nanything for her. She replied that she wanted his name. He looked about\nand said, “But here are other little girls–they will feel badly if I\ngive my name only to you.” She said there were eight of them in all.\n“Then,” said he, “get me eight sheets of paper, and a pen and ink, and\nI will see what I can do for you.” The materials were brought, and in\nthe crowded drawing-room he sat down, wrote a sentence and his name on\neach sheet of paper. Thus he made eight little girls happy.",
        "The campaign was one of great excitement. His letter of acceptance was\nof the briefest description and simply announced his adherence to the\nplatform. For the rest, his previous utterances in the debates with\nDouglas, the Cooper Institute speech, and other addresses, were in\nprint, and he was content to stand by the record. He showed his wisdom\nin his refusing to be diverted, or to allow his party to be diverted,\nfrom the one important question of preventing the further extension of\nslavery. The public were not permitted to lose sight of the fact that\nthis was the real issue. The Chicago wigwam was copied in many cities:\ntemporary wooden structures were erected for republican meetings. These\ndid good service as rallying centers.",
        "Then the campaign biographers began to appear. It was said that by June\nhe had had no less than fifty-two applications to write his biography.\nOne such book was written by W. D. Howells, not so famous in literature\nthen as now. Lincoln furnished a sketch of his life, an “autobiography\"\nso called. This contains only about five hundred words. Its brevity is\nan indication of its modesty.",
        "Nor was there any lack of eulogistic music. Among the writers of\ncampaign songs were J. G. Whittier and E. C. Stedman.",
        "The parading contingent of the party was represented by the “Wide-\nAwakes.” The uniform was as effective as simple. It consisted of a\ncadet cap and a cape, both made of oil-cloth, and a torch. The first\ncompany was organized in Hartford. It had escorted Lincoln from the\nhotel to the hall and back again when he spoke in that city in February\nafter his Cooper Institute speech. The idea of this uniformed company\nof cadets captivated the public fancy. Bands of Wide-Awakes were\norganized in every community in the North. At the frequent political\nrallies they poured in by thousands and tens of thousands, a very\npicturesque sight. The original band in Hartford obtained the identical\nmaul with which Lincoln had split those rails in 1830. It is now in the\ncollection of the Connecticut Historical Society, in Hartford.",
        "Though Lincoln had much to cheer him, he had also his share of\nannoyances. One of his discouragements was so serious, and at this day\nit appears so amazing, that it is given nearly in full. A careful\ncanvas had been made of the voters of Springfield, and the intention of\neach voter had been recorded. Lincoln had the book containing this\nrecord. He asked his friend Mr. Bateman, the State Superintendent of\nPublic Instruction, to look through the book with him. They noted\nparticularly those who might be considered leaders of public morals:\nclergymen, officers, or prominent members of the churches.",
        "When the memorandum was tabulated, after some minutes of silence, he\nturned a sad face to Mr. Bateman, and said: “Here are twenty-three\nministers, of different denominations, and all of them are against me\nbut three; and here are a great many prominent members of the churches,\na very large majority of whom are against me. Mr. Bateman, I am not a\nChristian–God knows I would be one–but I have carefully read the\nBible, and I do not so understand this book.” He drew from his pocket a\nNew Testament. “These men well know that I am for freedom in the\nterritories, freedom everywhere as far as the Constitution and laws\nwill permit, and that my opponents are for slavery. They know this, and\nyet, with this book in their hands, in the light of which human bondage\ncannot live a moment, they are going to vote against me. I do not\nunderstand it at all.”",
        "After a long pause, he added with tears: “I know there is a God, and\nthat He hates injustice and slavery. I see the storm coming, and I know\nthat His hand is in it. If He has a place and work for me–and I think\nHe has–I believe I am ready. I am nothing, but truth is everything. I\nknow I am right because I know that liberty is right, for Christ\nteaches it, and Christ is God. I have told them that a house divided\nagainst itself cannot stand, and Christ and reason say the same; and\nthey will find it so. Douglas doesn’t care whether slavery is voted up\nor voted down, but God cares, and humanity cares, and I care; and with\nGod’s help I shall not fail. I may not see the end; but it will come\nand I shall be vindicated; and these men will find that they have not\nread their Bibles aright.”",
        "After another pause: “Doesn’t it appear strange that men can ignore the\nmoral aspects of this contest? A revelation could not make it plainer\nto me that slavery or the government must be destroyed. The future\nwould be something awful, as I look at it, but for this rock [the\nTestament which he was holding] on which I stand,–especially with the\nknowledge of how these ministers are going to vote. It seems as if God\nhad borne with this thing [slavery] until the very teachers of religion\nhad come to defend it from the Bible, and to claim for it a divine\ncharacter and sanction; and now the cup of iniquity is full, and the\nvials of wrath will be poured out.”",
        "Lincoln did not wear his heart upon his sleeve. On the subject of\nreligion, he was reticent to a degree. Peter Cartwright had called him\nan atheist. There was a wide, if not general, impression, that he was\nnot a religious man. This did him great injustice. It is for this\nreason that his remarks to Mr. Bateman are here quoted at length. From\nhis early boyhood, from before the time when he was at great pains to\nhave a memorial sermon for his mother, he was profoundly, intensely\nreligious. He did no injustice to any other man, he did not do justice\nto himself.",
        "The election occurred on the sixth day of November. The vote was as\nfollows: Lincoln received 1,866,452 popular votes, and one hundred and\neighty electoral votes. Douglas received 1,375,157 popular votes, and\ntwelve electoral votes. Breckinridge received 847,953 popular votes,\nand seventy-two electoral votes. Bell received 590,631 popular votes,\nand thirty-nine electoral votes.",
        "Lincoln carried all the free states, excepting that in New Jersey the\nelectoral vote was divided, he receiving four out of seven. In the\nfifteen slave states he received no electoral vote. In ten states not\none person had voted for him.",
        "Of the 303 electoral votes he had received 180, while the aggregate of\nall against him numbered 123, giving him an absolute majority of 57.\nThe electoral vote was duly counted in the joint session of the two\nhouses of congress February 13, 1861, and it was officially announced\nthat Abraham Lincoln, having received a majority of the votes of the\npresidential electors, was duly elected President of the United States\nfor four years, beginning March 4, 1861.",
        "One circumstance is added which may be of interest to the reader. This\nwas published, after his death, by his personal friend, Noah Brooks. It\nis given in Lincoln’s own words: “It was just after my election, in\n1860, when the news had been coming in thick and fast all day, and\nthere had been a great ’Hurrah boys!’ so that I was well tired out and\nwent home to rest, throwing myself upon a lounge in my chamber.\nOpposite to where I lay was a bureau with a swinging glass upon it; and\nlooking in that glass, I saw myself reflected nearly at full length;\nbut my face, I noticed, had two separate and distinct images, the tip\nof the nose of the one being about three inches from the tip of the\nother. I was a little bothered, perhaps startled, and got up and looked\nin the glass, but the illusion vanished. On lying down again, I saw it\na second time, plainer, if possible, than before; and then I noticed\nthat one of the faces was a little paler–say five shades–than the\nother. I got up, and the thing melted away, and I went off, and, in the\nexcitement of the hour, forgot all about it,–nearly, but not quite,\nfor the thing would once in a while come up, and give me a little pang\nas though something uncomfortable had happened. When I went home, I\ntold my wife about it, and a few days after I tried the experiment\nagain, when, sure enough, the thing came back again; but I never\nsucceeded in bringing the ghost back after that, though I once tried\nvery industriously to show it to my wife, who was worried about it\nsomewhat. She thought it was ’a sign’ that I was to be elected to a\nsecond term of office, and that the paleness of one of the faces was an\nomen that I should not see life through the last term.”",
        "The incident is of no interest excepting in so far as everything about\nLincoln is of interest. The phenomenon is an optical illusion not\nuncommon. One image–the “paler,” or more indistinct, one–is reflected\nfrom the surface of the glass, while the other is reflected from the\nsilvered back of the glass. Though Lincoln understood that it was an\noptical illusion, yet the thought of it evidently weighed on him.\nOtherwise he would not have repeated the experiment several times, nor\nwould he have told of it to different persons.",
