        "\nThe parts of Tragedy to be treated as formative elements in the whole\nwere mentioned in a previous Chapter. From the point of view, however,\nof its quantity, i.e. the separate sections into which it is divided,\na tragedy has the following parts: Prologue, Episode, Exode, and a\nchoral portion, distinguished into Parode and Stasimon; these two are\ncommon to all tragedies, whereas songs from the stage and Commoe are\nonly found in some. The Prologue is all that precedes the Parode of\nthe chorus; an Episode all that comes in between two whole choral\nsongs; the Exode all that follows after the last choral song. In the\nchoral portion the Parode is the whole first statement of the chorus;\na Stasimon, a song of the chorus without anapaests or trochees; a\nCommas, a lamentation sung by chorus and actor in concert. The parts\nof Tragedy to be used as formative elements in the whole we have\nalready mentioned; the above are its parts from the point of view of\nits quantity, or the separate sections into which it is divided.",
