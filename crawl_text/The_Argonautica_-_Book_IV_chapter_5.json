        "(ll. 1-5)  Now do thou thyself, goddess Muse, daughter of Zeus,\ntell of the labour and wiles of the Colchian maiden.  Surely my\nsoul within me wavers with speechless amazement as I ponder\nwhether I should call it the lovesick grief of mad passion or a\npanic flight, through which she left the Colchian folk.",
        "(ll. 6-10)  Aeetes all night long with the bravest captains of\nhis people was devising in his halls sheer treachery against the\nheroes, with fierce wrath in his heart at the issue of the\nhateful contest; nor did he deem at all that these things were\nbeing accomplished without the knowledge of his daughters.",
        "(ll. 11-29)  But into Medea’s heart Hera cast most grievous fear;\nand she trembled like a nimble fawn whom the baying of hounds\nhath terrified amid the thicket of a deep copse.  For at once she\ntruly forboded that the aid she had given was not hidden from her\nfather, and that quickly she would fill up the cup of woe.  And\nshe dreaded the guilty knowledge of her handmaids; her eyes were\nfilled with fire and her ears rung with a terrible cry.  Often\ndid she clutch at her throat, and often did she drag out her hair\nby the roots and groan in wretched despair.  There on that very\nday the maiden would have tasted the drugs and perished and so\nhave made void the purposes of Hera, had not the goddess driven\nher, all bewildered, to flee with the sons of Phrixus; and her\nfluttering soul within her was comforted; and then she poured\nfrom her bosom all the drugs back again into the casket.  Then\nshe kissed her bed, and the folding-doors on both sides, and\nstroked the walls, and tearing away in her hands a long tress of\nhair, she left it in the chamber for her mother, a memorial of\nher maidenhood, and thus lamented with passionate voice:",
        "(ll. 30-33)  “I go, leaving this long tress here in my stead, O\nmother mine; take this farewell from me as I go far hence;\nfarewell Chalciope, and all my home.  Would that the sea,\nstranger, had dashed thee to pieces, ere thou camest to the\nColchian land!”",
        "(ll. 34-56)  Thus she spake, and from her eyes shed copious\ntears.  And as a bondmaid steals away from a wealthy house, whom\nfate has lately severed from her native land, nor yet has she\nmade trial of grievous toil, but still unschooled to misery and\nshrinking in terror from slavish tasks, goes about beneath the\ncruel hands of a mistress; even so the lovely maiden rushed forth\nfrom her home.  But to her the bolts of the doors gave way\nself-moved, leaping backwards at the swift strains of her magic\nsong.  And with bare feet she sped along the narrow paths, with\nher left hand holding her robe over her brow to veil her face and\nfair cheeks, and with her right lifting up the hem of her tunic.\nQuickly along the dark track, outside the towers of the spacious\ncity, did she come in fear; nor did any of the warders note her,\nbut she sped on unseen by them.  Thence she was minded to go to\nthe temple; for well she knew the way, having often aforetime\nwandered there in quest of corpses and noxious roots of the\nearth, as a sorceress is wont to do; and her soul fluttered with\nquivering fear.  And the Titanian goddess, the moon, rising from\na far land, beheld her as she fled distraught, and fiercely\nexulted over her, and thus spake to her own heart:",
        "(ll. 57-65)  “Not I alone then stray to the Latinian cave, nor do\nI alone burn with love for fair Endymion; oft times with thoughts\nof love have I been driven away by thy crafty spells, in order\nthat in the darkness of night thou mightest work thy sorcery at\nease, even the deeds dear to thee.  And now thou thyself too hast\npart in a like mad passion; and some god of affection has given\nthee Jason to be thy grievous woe.  Well, go on, and steel thy\nheart, wise though thou be, to take up thy burden of pain,\nfraught with many sighs.”",
        "(ll. 66-82)  Thus spake the goddess; but swiftly the maiden’s\nfeet bore her, hasting on.  And gladly did she gain the high-bank\nof the river and beheld on the opposite side the gleam of fire,\nwhich all night long the heroes were kindling in joy at the\ncontest’s issue.  Then through the gloom, with clear-pealing\nvoice from across the stream, she called on Phrontis, the\nyoungest of Phrixus’ sons, and he with his brothers and Aeson’s\nson recognised the maiden’s voice; and in silence his comrades\nwondered when they knew that it was so in truth.  Thrice she\ncalled, and thrice at the bidding of the company Phrontis called\nout in reply; and meantime the heroes were rowing with swift-\nmoving oars in search of her.  Not yet were they casting the\nship’s hawsers upon the opposite bank, when Jason with light feet\nleapt to land from the deck above, and after him Phrontis and\nArgus, sons of Phrixus, leapt to the ground; and she, clasping\ntheir knees with both hands, thus addressed them:",
        "(ll. 83-91)  “Save me, the hapless one, my friends, from Aeetes,\nand yourselves too, for all is brought to light, nor doth any\nremedy come.  But let us flee upon the ship, before the king\nmounts his swift chariot.  And I will lull to sleep the guardian\nserpent and give you the fleece of gold; but do thou, stranger,\namid thy comrades make the gods witness of the vows thou hast\ntaken on thyself for my sake; and now that I have fled far from\nmy country, make me not a mark for blame and dishonour for want\nof kinsmen.”",
        "(ll. 92-98)  She spake in anguish; but greatly did the heart of\nAeson’s son rejoice, and at once, as she fell at his knees, he\nraised her gently and embraced her, and spake words of comfort:\n“Lady, let Zeus of Olympus himself be witness to my oath, and\nHera, queen of marriage, bride of Zeus, that I will set thee in\nmy halls my own wedded wife, when we have reached the land of\nHellas on our return.”",
        "(ll. 99-108)  Thus he spake, and straightway clasped her right\nhand in his; and she bade them row the swift ship to the sacred\ngrove near at hand, in order that, while it was still night, they\nmight seize and carry off the fleece against the will of Aeetes.\nWord and deed were one to the eager crew.  For they took her on\nboard, and straightway thrust the ship from shore; and loud was\nthe din as the chieftains strained at their oars, but she,\nstarting back, held out her hands in despair towards the shore.\nBut Jason spoke cheering words and restrained her grief.",
        "(ll. 109-122)  Now at the hour when men have cast sleep from\ntheir eyes~huntsmen, who, trusting to their bounds, never slumber\naway the end of night, but avoid the light of dawn lest, smiting\nwith its white beams, it efface the track and scent of the quarry\n– then did Aeson’s son and the maiden step forth from the ship\nover a grassy spot, the “Ram’s couch” as men call it, where it\nfirst bent its wearied knees in rest, bearing on its back the\nMinyan son of Athamas.  And close by, all smirched with soot, was\nthe base of the altar, which the Aeolid Phrixus once set up to\nZeus, the alder of fugitives, when he sacrificed the golden\nwonder at the bidding of Hermes who graciously met him on the\nway.  There by the counsels of Argus the chieftains put them\nashore.",
        "(ll. 123-161)  And they two by the pathway came to the sacred\ngrove, seeking the huge oak tree on which was hung the fleece,\nlike to a cloud that blushes red with the fiery beams of the\nrising sun.  But right in front the serpent with his keen\nsleepless eyes saw them coming, and stretched out his long neck\nand hissed in awful wise; and all round the long banks of the\nriver echoed and the boundless grove.  Those heard it who dwelt\nin the Colchian land very far from Titanian Aea, near the outfall\nof Lycus, the river which parts from loud-roaring Araxes and\nblends his sacred stream with Phasis, and they twain flow on\ntogether in one and pour their waters into the Caucasian Sea.\nAnd through fear young mothers awoke, and round their new-born\nbabes, who were sleeping in their arms, threw their hands in\nagony, for the small limbs started at that hiss.  And as when\nabove a pile of smouldering wood countless eddies of smoke roll\nup mingled with soot, and one ever springs up quickly after\nanother, rising aloft from beneath in wavering wreaths; so at\nthat time did that monster roll his countless coils covered with\nhard dry scales.  And as he writhed, the maiden came before his\neyes, with sweet voice calling to her aid sleep, highest of gods,\nto charm the monster; and she cried to the queen of the\nunderworld, the night-wanderer, to be propitious to her\nenterprise.  And Aeson’s son followed in fear, but the serpent,\nalready charmed by her song, was relaxing the long ridge of his\ngiant spine, and lengthening out his myriad coils, like a dark\nwave, dumb and noiseless, rolling over a sluggish sea; but still\nhe raised aloft his grisly head, eager to enclose them both in\nhis murderous jaws.  But she with a newly cut spray of juniper,\ndipping and drawing untempered charms from her mystic brew,\nsprinkled his eyes, while she chanted her song; and all around\nthe potent scent of the charm cast sleep; and on the very spot he\nlet his jaw sink down; and far behind through the wood with its\nmany trees were those countless coils stretched out.",
        "Hereupon Jason snatched the golden fleece from the oak, at the\nmaiden bidding; and she, standing firm, smeared with the charm\nthe monster’s head, till Jason himself bade her turn back towards\ntheir ship, and she left the grove of Ares, dusky with shade.\nAnd as a maiden catches on her finely wrought robe the gleam of\nthe moon at the full, as it rises above her high-roofed chamber;\nand her heart rejoices as she beholds the fair ray; so at that\ntime did Jason uplift the mighty fleece in his hands; and from\nthe shimmering of the flocks of wool there settled on his fair\ncheeks and brow a red flush like a flame.  And great as is the\nhide of a yearling ox or stag, which huntsmen call a brocket, so\ngreat in extent was the fleece all golden above.  Heavy it was,\nthickly clustered with flocks; and as he moved along, even\nbeneath his feet the sheen rose up from the earth.  And he strode\non now with the fleece covering his left shoulder from the height\nof his neck to his feet, and now again he gathered it up in his\nhands; for he feared exceedingly, lest some god or man should\nmeet him and deprive him thereof.",
        "(ll. 183-189)  Dawn was spreading over the earth when they\nreached the throng of heroes; and the youths marvelled to behold\nthe mighty fleece, which gleamed like the lightning of Zeus.  And\neach one started up eager to touch it and clasp it in his hands.\nBut the son of Aeson restrained them all, and threw over it a\nmantle newly-woven; and he led the maiden to the stern and seated\nher there, and spake to them all as follows:",
        "(ll. 190-205)  “No longer now, my friends, forbear to return to\nyour fatherland.  For now the task for which we dared this\ngrievous voyage, toiling with bitter sorrow of heart, has been\nlightly fulfilled by the maiden’s counsels.  Her–for such is\nher will–I will bring home to be my wedded wife; do ye\npreserve her, the glorious saviour of all Achaea and of\nyourselves.  For of a surety, I ween, will Aeetes come with his\nhost to bar our passage from the river into the sea.  But do some\nof you toil at the oars in turn, sitting man by man; and half of\nyou raise your shields of oxhide, a ready defence against the\ndarts of the enemy, and guard our return.  And now in our hands\nwe hold the fate of our children and dear country and of our aged\nparents; and on our venture all Hellas depends, to reap either\nthe shame of failure or great renown.”",
        "(ll. 206-211)  Thus he spake, and donned his armour of war; and\nthey cried aloud, wondrously eager.  And he drew his sword from\nthe sheath and cut the hawsers at the stern.  And near the maiden\nhe took his stand ready armed by the steersman Aneaeus, and with\ntheir rowing the ship sped on as they strained desperately to\ndrive her clear of the river.",
        "(ll. 212-235)  By this time Medea’s love and deeds had become\nknown to haughty Aeetes and to all the Colchians.  And they\nthronged to the assembly in arms; and countless as the waves of\nthe stormy sea when they rise crested by the wind, or as the\nleaves that fall to the ground from the wood with its myriad\nbranches in the month when the leaves fall–who could reckon\ntheir tale?–so they in countless number poured along the banks\nof the river shouting in frenzy; and in his shapely chariot\nAeetes shone forth above all with his steeds, the gift of Helios,\nswift as the blasts of the wind.  In his left hand he raised his\ncurved shield, and in his right a huge pine-torch, and near him\nin front stood up his mighty spear.  And Apsyrtus held in his\nhands the reins of the steeds.  But already the ship was cleaving\nthe sea before her, urged on by stalwart oarsmen, and the stream\nof the mighty river rushing down.  But the king in grievous\nanguish lifted his hands and called on Helios and Zeus to bear\nwitness to their evil deeds; and terrible threats he uttered\nagainst all his people, that unless they should with their own\nhands seize the maiden, either on the land or still finding the\nship on the swell of the open sea, and bring her back, that so he\nmight satisfy his eager soul with vengeance for all those deeds,\nat the cost of their own lives they should learn and abide all\nhis rage and revenge.",
        "(ll. 236-240)  Thus spake Aeetes; and on that same day the\nColchians launched their ships and cast the tackle on board, and\non that same day sailed forth on the sea; thou wouldst not say so\nmighty a host was a fleet of ships, but that a countless flight\nof birds, swarm on swarm, was clamouring over the sea.",
        "(ll. 241-252)  Swiftly the wind blew, as the goddess Hera\nplanned, so that most quickly Aeaean Medea might reach the\nPelasgian land, a bane to the house of Pelias, and on the third\nmorn they bound the ship’s stern cables to the shores of the\nPaphlagonians, at the mouth of the river Halys.  For Medea bade\nthem land and propitiate Hecate with sacrifice.  Now all that the\nmaiden prepared for offering the sacrifice may no man know, and\nmay my soul not urge me to sing thereof.  Awe restrains my lips,\nyet from that time the altar which the heroes raised on the beach\nto the goddess remains till now, a sight to men of a later day.",
        "(ll. 253-256)  And straightway Aeson’s son and the rest of the\nheroes bethought them of Phineus, how that he had said that their\ncourse from Aea should be different, but to all alike his meaning\nwas dim.  Then Argus spake, and they eagerly hearkened:",
        "(ll. 257-293)  “We go to Orchomenus, whither that unerring seer,\nwhom ye met aforetime, foretold your voyage.  For there is\nanother course, signified by those priests of the immortal gods,\nwho have sprung from Tritonian Thebes.  As yet all the stars that\nwheel in the heaven were not, nor yet, though one should inquire,\ncould aught be heard of the sacred race of the Danai.  Apidanean\nArcadians alone existed, Arcadians who lived even before the\nmoon, it is said, eating acorns on the hills; nor at that time\nwas the Pelasgian land ruled by the glorious sons of Deucalion,\nin the days when Egypt, mother of men of an older time, was\ncalled the fertile Morning-land, and the river fair-flowing\nTriton, by which all the Morning-land is watered; and never does\nthe rain from Zeus moisten the earth; but from the flooding of\nthe river abundant crops spring up.  From this land, it is said,\na king (1) made his way all round through the whole of Europe and\nAsia, trusting in the might and strength and courage of his\npeople; and countless cities did he found wherever he came,\nwhereof some are still inhabited and some not; many an age hath\npassed since then.  But Aea abides unshaken even now and the sons\nof those men whom that king settled to dwell in Aea.  They\npreserve the writings of their fathers, graven on pillars,\nwhereon are marked all the ways and the limits of sea and land as\nye journey on all sides round.  There is a river, the uttermost\nhorn of Ocean, broad and exceeding deep, that a merchant ship may\ntraverse; they call it Ister and have marked it far off; and for\na while it cleaves the boundless tilth alone in one stream; for\nbeyond the blasts of the north wind, far off in the Rhipaean\nmountains, its springs burst forth with a roar.  But when it\nenters the boundaries of the Thracians and Scythians, here,\ndividing its stream into two, it sends its waters partly into the\nIonian sea, (2) and partly to the south into a deep gulf that\nbends upwards from the Trinaerian sea, that sea which lies along\nyour land, if indeed Achelous flows forth from your land.”",
        "(ll. 204-302)  Thus he spake, and to them the goddess granted a\nhappy portent, and all at the sight shouted approval, that this\nwas their appointed path.  For before them appeared a trail of\nheavenly light, a sign where they might pass.  And gladly they\nleft behind there the son of Lyeus and with canvas outspread\nsailed over the sea, with their eyes on the Paphlagonian\nmountains.  But they did not round Carambis, for the winds and\nthe gleam of the heavenly fire stayed with them till they reached\nIster’s mighty stream.",
        "(ll. 303-337)  Now some of the Colchians, in a vain search,\npassed out from Pontus through the Cyanean rocks; but the rest\nwent to the river, and them Apsyrtus led, and, turning aside, he\nentered the mouth called Fair.  Wherefore he outstripped the\nheroes by crossing a neck of land into the furthest gulf of the\nIonian sea.  For a certain island is enclosed by Ister, by name\nPeuee, three-cornered, its base stretching along the coast, and\nwith a sharp angle towards the river; and round it the outfall is\ncleft in two.  One mouth they call the mouth of Narex, and the\nother, at the lower end, the Fair mouth.  And through this\nApsyrtus and his Colchians rushed with all speed; but the heroes\nwent upwards far away towards the highest part of the island. \nAnd in the meadows the country shepherds left their countless\nflocks for dread of the ships, for they deemed that they were\nbeasts coming forth from the monster-teeming sea.  For never yet\nbefore had they seen seafaring ships, neither the Scythians\nmingled with the Thracians, nor the Sigynni, nor yet the\nGraucenii, nor the Sindi that now inhabit the vast desert plain\nof Laurium.  But when they had passed near the mount Angurum, and\nthe cliff of Cauliacus, far from the mount Angurum, round which\nIster, dividing his stream, falls into the sea on this side and\non that, and the Laurian plain, then indeed the Colchians went\nforth into the Cronian sea and cut off all the ways, to prevent\ntheir foes’ escape.  And the heroes came down the river behind\nand reached the two Brygean isles of Artemis near at hand.  Now\nin one of them was a sacred temple; and on the other they landed,\navoiding the host of Apsyrtus; for the Colchians had left these\nislands out of many within the river, just as they were, through\nreverence for the daughter of Zeus; but the rest, thronged by the\nColchians, barred the ways to the sea.  And so on other islands\ntoo, close by, Apsyrtus left his host as far as the river\nSalangon and the Nestian land.",
        "(ll. 338-349)  There the Minyae would at that time have yielded\nin grim fight, a few to many; but ere then they made a covenant,\nshunning a dire quarrel; as to the golden fleece, that since\nAeetes himself had so promised them if they should fulfill the\ncontests, they should keep it as justly won, whether they carried\nit off by craft or even openly in the king’s despite; but as to\nMedea–for that was the cause of strife–that they should\ngive her in ward to Leto’s daughter apart from the throng, until\nsome one of the kings that dispense justice should utter his\ndoom, whether she must return to her father’s home or follow the\nchieftains to the land of Hellas.",
        "(ll. 350-354)  Now when the maiden had mused upon all this, sharp\nanguish shook her heart unceasingly; and quickly she called forth\nJason alone apart from his comrades, and led him aside until they\nwere far away, and before his face uttered her speech all broken\nwith sobs:",
        "(ll. 355-390)  “What is this purpose that ye are now devising\nabout me, O son of Aeson?  Has thy triumph utterly cast\nforgetfulness upon thee, and reekest thou nothing of all that\nthou spakest when held fast by necessity?  Whither are fled the\noaths by Zeus the suppliants’ god, whither are fled thy honied\npromises?  For which in no seemly wise, with shameless will, I\nhave left my country, the glories of my home and even my parents\n– things that were dearest to me; and far away all alone I am\nborne over the sea with the plaintive kingfishers because of thy\ntrouble, in order that I might save thy life in fulfilling the\ncontests with the oxen and the earthborn men.  Last of all the\nfleece–when the matter became known, it was by my folly thou\ndidst win it; and a foul reproach have I poured on womankind.\nWherefore I say that as thy child, thy bride and thy sister, I\nfollow thee to the land of Hellas.  Be ready to stand by me to\nthe end, abandon me not left forlorn of thee when thou dost visit\nthe kings.  But only save me; let justice and right, to which we\nhave both agreed, stand firm; or else do thou at once shear\nthrough this neck with the sword, that I may gain the guerdon due\nto my mad passion.  Poor wretch!  if the king, to whom you both\ncommit your cruel covenant, doom me to belong to my brother.  How\nshall I come to my father’s sight?  Will it be with a good name?\nWhat revenge, what heavy calamity shall I not endure in agony for\nthe terrible deeds I have done?  And wilt thou win the return\nthat thy heart desires?  Never may Zeus’ bride, the queen of all,\nin whom thou dost glory, bring that to pass.  Mayst thou some\ntime remember me when thou art racked with anguish; may the\nfleece like a dream vanish into the nether darkness on the wings\nof the wind!  And may my avenging Furies forthwith drive thee\nfrom thy country, for all that I have suffered through thy\ncruelty!  These curses will not be allowed to fall unaccomplished\nto the ground.  A mighty oath hast thou transgressed, ruthless\none; but not long shalt thou and thy comrades sit at ease casting\neyes of mockery upon me, for all your covenants.”",
        "(ll. 391-394)  Thus she spake, seething with fierce wrath; and\nshe longed to set fire to the ship and to hew it utterly in\npieces, and herself to fall into the raging flame.  But Jason,\nhalf afraid, thus addressed her with gentle words:",
        "(ll. 395-409)  “Forbear, lady; me too this pleases not.  But we\nseek some respite from battle, for such a cloud of hostile men,\nlike to a fire, surrounds us, on thy account.  For all that\ninhabit this land are eager to aid Apsyrtus, that they may lead\nthee back home to thy father, like some captured maid.  And all\nof us would perish in hateful destruction, if we closed with them\nin fight; and bitterer still will be the pain, if we are slain\nand leave thee to be their prey.  But this covenant will weave a\nweb of guile to lead him to ruin.  Nor will the people of the\nland for thy sake oppose us, to favour the Colchians, when their\nprince is no longer with them, who is thy champion and thy\nbrother; nor will I shrink from matching myself in fight with the\nColchians, if they bar my way homeward.”",
        "(ll. 410-420)  Thus he spake soothing her; and she uttered a\ndeadly speech: “Take heed now.  For when sorry deeds are done we\nmust needs devise sorry counsel, since at first I was distraught\nby my error, and by heaven’s will it was I wrought the\naccomplishment of evil desires.  Do thou in the turmoil shield me\nfrom the Colchians’ spears; and I will beguile Apsyrtus to come\ninto thy hands–do thou greet him with splendid gifts–if\nonly I could persuade the heralds on their departure to bring him\nalone to hearken to my words.  Thereupon if this deed pleases\nthee, slay him and raise a conflict with the Colchians, I care\nnot.",
        "(ll. 421-422)  So they two agreed and prepared a great web of\nguile for Apsyrtus, and provided many gifts such as are due to\nguests, and among them gave a sacred robe of Hypsipyle, of\ncrimson hue.  The Graces with their own hands had wrought it for\nDionysus in sea-girt Dia, and he gave it to his son Thoas\nthereafter, and Thoas left it to Hypsipyle, and she gave that\nfair-wrought guest-gift with many another marvel to Aeson’s son\nto wear.  Never couldst thou satisfy thy sweet desire by touching\nit or gazing on it.  And from it a divine fragrance breathed from\nthe time when the king of Nysa himself lay to rest thereon,\nflushed with wine and nectar as he clasped the beauteous breast\nof the maiden-daughter of Minos, whom once Theseus forsook in the\nisland of Dia, when she had followed him from Cnossus.  And when\nshe had worked upon the heralds to induce her brother to come, as\nsoon as she reached the temple of the goddess, according to the\nagreement, and the darkness of night surrounded them, that so she\nmight devise with him a cunning plan for her to take the mighty\nfleece of gold and return to the home of Aeetes, for, she said,\nthe sons of Phrixus had given her by force to the strangers to\ncarry off; with such beguiling words she scattered to the air and\nthe breezes her witching charms, which even from afar would have\ndrawn down the savage beast from the steep mountain-height.",
        "(ll. 445-451)  Ruthless Love, great bane, great curse to mankind,\nfrom thee come deadly strifes and lamentations and groans, and\ncountless pains as well have their stormy birth from thee. \nArise, thou god, and arm thyself against the sons of our foes in\nsuch guise as when thou didst fill Medea’s heart with accursed\nmadness.  How then by evil doom did she slay Apsyrtus when he\ncame to meet her?  For that must our song tell next.",
        "(ll. 452-481)  When the heroes had left the maiden on the island\nof Artemis, according to the covenant, both sides ran their ships\nto land separately.  And Jason went to the ambush to lie in wait\nfor Apsyrtus and then for his comrades.  But he, beguiled by\nthese dire promises, swiftly crossed the swell of the sea in his\nship, and in dark night set foot on the sacred island; and faring\nall alone to meet her he made trial in speech of his sister, as a\ntender child tries a wintry torrent which not even strong men can\npass through, to see if she would devise some guile against the\nstrangers.  And so they two agreed together on everything; and\nstraightway Aeson’s son leapt forth from the thick ambush,\nlifting his bare sword in his hand; and quickly the maiden turned\nher eyes aside and covered them with her veil that she might not\nsee the blood of her brother when he was smitten.  And Jason\nmarked him and struck him down, as a butcher strikes down a\nmighty strong-horned bull, hard by the temple which the Brygi on\nthe mainland opposite had once built for Artemis.  In its\nvestibule he fell on his knees; and at last the hero breathing\nout his life caught up in both hands the dark blood as it welled\nfrom the wound; and he dyed with red his sister’s silvery veil\nand robe as she shrank away.  And with swift side-glance the\nirresistible pitiless Fury beheld the deadly deed they had done.\nAnd the hero, Aeson’s son, cut off the extremities of the dead\nman, and thrice licked up some blood and thrice spat the\npollution from his teeth, as it is right for the slayer to do, to\natone for a treacherous murder.  And the clammy corpse he hid in\nthe ground where even now those bones lie among the Apsyrtians.",
        "(ll. 481-494)  Now as soon as the heroes saw the blaze of a\ntorch, which the maiden raised for them as a sign to pursue, they\nlaid their own ship near the Colchian ship, and they slaughtered\nthe Colchian host, as kites slay the tribes of wood-pigeons, or\nas lions of the wold, when they have leapt amid the steading,\ndrive a great flock of sheep huddled together.  Nor did one of\nthem escape death, but the heroes rushed upon the whole crew,\ndestroying them like a flame; and at last Jason met them, and was\neager to give aid where none was needed; but already they were\ntaking thought for him too.  Thereupon they sat to devise some)\nprudent counsel for their voyage, and the maiden came upon them\nas they pondered, but Peleus spake his word first:",
        "(ll. 495-502)  “I now bid you embark while it is still night, and\ntake with your oars the passage opposite to that which the enemy\nguards, for at dawn when they see their plight I deem that no\nword urging to further pursuit of us will prevail with them; but\nas people bereft of their king, they will be scattered in\ngrievous dissension.  And easy, when the people are scattered,\nwill this path be for us on our return.”",
        "(ll. 503-506)  Thus he spake; and the youths assented to the\nwords of Aeacus’ son.  And quickly they entered the ship, and\ntoiled at their oars unceasingly until they reached the sacred\nisle of Electra, the highest of them all, near the river\nEridanus.",
        "(ll. 507-521)  But when the Colchians learnt the death of their\nprince, verily they were eager to pursue Argo and the Minyans\nthrough all the Cronian sea.  But Hera restrained them by\nterrible lightnings from the sky.  And at last they loathed their\nown homes in the Cytaean land, quailing before Aeetes’ fierce\nwrath; so they landed and made abiding homes there, scattered far\nand wide.  Some set foot on those very islands where the heroes\nhad stayed, and they still dwell there, bearing a name derived\nfrom Apsyrtus; and others built a fenced city by the dark deep\nIllyrian river, where is the tomb of Harmonia and Cadmus,\ndwelling among the Encheleans; and others live amid the mountains\nwhich are called the Thunderers, from the day when the thunders\nof Zeus, son of Cronos, prevented them from crossing over to the\nisland opposite.",
        "(ll. 522-551)  Now the heroes, when their return seemed safe for\nthem, fared onward and made their hawsers fast to the land of the\nHylleans.  For the islands lay thick in the river and made the\npath dangerous for those who sailed thereby.  Nor, as aforetime,\ndid the Hylleans devise their hurt, but of their own accord\nfurthered their passage, winning as guerdon a mighty tripod of\nApollo.  For tripods twain had Phoebus given to Aeson’s son to\ncarry afar in the voyage he had to make, at the time when he went\nto sacred Pytho to enquire about this very voyage; and it was\nordained by fate that in whatever land they should be placed,\nthat land should never be ravaged by the attacks of foemen.\nTherefore even now this tripod is hidden in that land near the\npleasant city of Hyllus, far beneath the earth, that it may ever\nbe unseen by mortals.  Yet they found not King Hyllus still alive\nin the land, whom fair Melite bare to Heracles in the land of the\nPhaeacians.  For he came to the abode of Nausithous and to\nMacris, the nurse of Dionysus, to cleanse himself from the deadly\nmurder of his children; here he loved and overcame the water\nnymph Melite, the daughter of the river Aegaeus, and she bare\nmighty Hyllus.  But when he had grown up he desired not to dwell\nin that island under the rule of Nausithous the king; but he\ncollected a host of native Phaeacians and came to the Cronian\nsea; for the hero King Nausithous aided his journey, and there he\nsettled, and the Mentores slew him as he was fighting for the\noxen of his field.",
        "(ll. 552-556)  Now, goddesses, say how it is that beyond this\nsea, near the land of Ausonia and the Ligystian isles, which are\ncalled Stoechades, the mighty tracks of the ship Argo are clearly\nsung of?  What great constraint and need brought the heroes so\nfar?  What breezes wafted them?",
        "(ll. 557-591)  When Apsyrtus had fallen in mighty overthrow Zeus\nhimself, king of gods, was seized with wrath at what they had\ndone.  And he ordained that by the counsels of Aeaean Circe they\nshould cleanse themselves from the terrible stain of blood and\nsuffer countless woes before their return.  Yet none of the\nchieftains knew this; but far onward they sped starting from the\nHyllean land, and they left behind all the islands that were\nbeforetime thronged by the Colchians–the Liburnian isles, isle\nafter isle, Issa, Dysceladus, and lovely Pityeia.  Next after\nthem they came to Corcyra, where Poseidon settled the daughter of\nAsopus, fair-haired Corcyra, far from the land of Phlius, whence\nhe had carried her off through love; and sailors beholding it\nfrom the sea, all black with its sombre woods, call it Corcyra\nthe Black.  And next they passed Melite, rejoicing in the\nsoft-blowing breeze, and steep Cerossus, and Nymphaea at a\ndistance, where lady Calypso, daughter of Atlas, dwelt; and they\ndeemed they saw the misty mountains of Thunder.  And then Hera\nbethought her of the counsels and wrath of Zeus concerning them.\nAnd she devised an ending of their voyage and stirred up\nstorm-winds before them, by which they were caught and borne back\nto the rocky isle of Electra.  And straightway on a sudden there\ncalled to them in the midst of their course, speaking with a\nhuman voice, the beam of the hollow ship, which Athena had set in\nthe centre of the stem, made of Dodonian oak.  And deadly fear\nseized them as they heard the voice that told of the grievous\nwrath of Zeus.  For it proclaimed that they should not escape the\npaths of an endless sea nor grievous tempests, unless Circe\nshould purge away the guilt of the ruthless murder of Apsyrtus;\nand it bade Polydeuces and Castor pray to the immortal gods first\nto grant a path through the Ausonian sea where they should find\nCirce, daughter of Perse and Helios.",
        "(ll. 592-626)  Thus Argo cried through the darkness; and the sons\nof Tyndareus uprose, and lifted their hands to the immortals\npraying for each boon: but dejection held the rest of the Minyan\nheroes.  And far on sped Argo under sail, and entered deep into\nthe stream of Eridanus; where once, smitten on the breast by the\nblazing bolt, Phaethon half-consumed fell from the chariot of\nHelios into the opening of that deep lake; and even now it\nbelcheth up heavy steam clouds from the smouldering wound.  And\nno bird spreading its light wings can cross that water; but in\nmid-course it plunges into the flame, fluttering.  And all around\nthe maidens, the daughters of Helios, enclosed in tall poplars,\nwretchedly wail a piteous plaint; and from their eyes they shed\non the ground bright drops of amber.  These are dried by the sun\nupon the sand; but whenever the waters of the dark lake flow over\nthe strand before the blast of the wailing wind, then they roll\non in a mass into Eridanus with swelling tide.  But the Celts\nhave attached this story to them, that these are the tears of\nLeto’s son, Apollo, that are borne along by the eddies, the\ncountless tears that he shed aforetime when he came to the sacred\nrace of the Hyperboreans and left shining heaven at the chiding\nof his father, being in wrath concerning his son whom divine\nCoronis bare in bright Lacereia at the mouth of Amyrus.  And such\nis the story told among these men.  But no desire for food or\ndrink seized the heroes nor were their thoughts turned to joy.\nBut they were sorely afflicted all day, heavy and faint at heart,\nwith the noisome stench, hard to endure, which the streams of\nEridanus sent forth from Phaethon still burning; and at night\nthey heard the piercing lament of the daughters of Helios,\nwailing with shrill voice; and, as they lamented, their tears\nwere borne on the water like drops of oil.",
        "(ll. 627-658)  Thence they entered the deep stream of Rhodanus\nwhich flows into Eridanus; and where they meet there is a roar of\nmingling waters.  Now that river, rising from the ends of the\nearth, where are the portals and mansions of Night, on one side\nbursts forth upon the beach of Ocean, at another pours into the\nIonian sea, and on the third through seven mouths sends its\nstream to the Sardinian sea and its limitless bay. (3)  And from\nRhodanus they entered stormy lakes, which spread throughout the\nCeltic mainland of wondrous size; and there they would have met\nwith an inglorious calamity; for a certain branch of the river\nwas bearing them towards a gulf of Ocean which in ignorance they\nwere about to enter, and never would they have returned from\nthere in safety.  But Hera leaping forth from heaven pealed her\ncry from the Hercynian rock; and all together were shaken with\nfear of her cry; for terribly crashed the mighty firmament.  And\nbackward they turned by reason of the goddess, and noted the path\nby which their return was ordained.  And after a long while they\ncame to the beach of the surging sea by the devising of Hera,\npassing unharmed through countless tribes of the Celts and\nLigyans.  For round them the goddess poured a dread mist day by\nday as they fared on.  And so, sailing through the midmost mouth,\nthey reached the Stoechades islands in safety by the aid of the\nsons of Zeus; wherefore altars and sacred rites are established\nin their honour for ever; and not that sea-faring alone did they\nattend to succour; but Zeus granted to them the ships of future\nsailors too.  Then leaving the Stoechades they passed on to the\nisland Aethalia, where after their toil they wiped away with\npebbles sweat in abundance; and pebbles like skin in colour are\nstrewn on the beach; (4) and there are their quoits and their\nwondrous armour; and there is the Argoan harbour called after\nthem.",
        "(ll. 659-684)  And quickly from there they passed through the\nsea, beholding the Tyrrhenian shores of Ausonia; and they came to\nthe famous harbour of Aeaea, and from the ship they cast hawsers\nto the shore near at hand.  And here they found Circe bathing her\nhead in the salt sea-spray, for sorely had she been scared by\nvisions of the night.  With blood her chambers and all the walls\nof her palace seemed to be running, and flame was devouring all\nthe magic herbs with which she used to bewitch strangers whoever\ncame; and she herself with murderous blood quenched the glowing\nflame, drawing it up in her hands; and she ceased from deadly\nfear.  Wherefore when morning came she rose, and with sea-spray\nwas bathing her hair and her garments.  And beasts, not\nresembling the beasts of the wild, nor yet like men in body, but\nwith a medley of limbs, went in a throng, as sheep from the fold\nin multitudes follow the shepherd.  Such creatures, compacted of\nvarious limbs, did each herself produce from the primeval slime\nwhen she had not yet grown solid beneath a rainless sky nor yet\nhad received a drop of moisture from the rays of the scorching\nsun; but time combined these forms and marshalled them in their\nranks; in such wise these monsters shapeless of form followed\nher.  And exceeding wonder seized the heroes, and at once, as\neach gazed on the form and face of Circe, they readily guessed\nthat she was the sister of Aeetes.",
        "(ll. 685-717)  Now when she had dismissed the fears of her\nnightly visions, straightway she fared backwards, and in her\nsubtlety she bade the heroes follow, charming them on with her\nhand.  Thereupon the host remained stedfast at the bidding of\nAeson’s son, but Jason drew with him the Colchian maid.  And both\nfollowed the selfsame path till they reached the hall of Circe,\nand she in amaze at their coming bade them sit on brightly\nburnished seats.  And they, quiet and silent, sped to the hearth\nand sat there, as is the wont of wretched suppliants.  Medea hid\nher face in both her hands, but Jason fixed in the ground the\nmighty hilted sword with which he had slain Aeetes’ son; nor did\nthey raise their eyes to meet her look.  And straightway Circe\nbecame aware of the doom of a suppliant and the guilt of murder.\nWherefore in reverence for the ordinance of Zeus, the god of\nsuppliants, who is a god of wrath yet mightily aids slayers of\nmen, she began to offer the sacrifice with which ruthless\nsuppliants are cleansed from guilt when they approach the altar.\nFirst, to atone for the murder still unexpiated, she held above\ntheir heads the young of a sow whose dugs yet swelled from the\nfruit of the womb, and, severing its neck, sprinkled their hands\nwith the blood; and again she made propitiation with other drink\nofferings, calling on Zeus the Cleanser, the protector of murder-\nstained suppliants.  And all the defilements in a mass her\nattendants bore forth from the palace–the Naiad nymphs who\nministered all things to her.  And within, Circe, standing by the\nhearth, kept burning atonement-cakes without wine, praying the\nwhile that she might stay from their wrath the terrible Furies,\nand that Zeus himself might be propitious and gentle to them \nboth, whether with hands stained by the blood of a stranger or,\nas kinsfolk, by the blood of a kinsman, they should implore his\ngrace.",
        "(ll. 718-738)  But when she had wrought all her task, then she\nraised them up and seated them on well polished seats, and\nherself sat near, face to face with them.  And at once she asked\nthem clearly of their business and their voyaging, and whence\nthey had come to her land and palace, and had thus seated\nthemselves as suppliants at her hearth.  For in truth the hideous\nremembrance of her dreams entered her mind as she pondered; and\nshe longed to hear the voice of the maiden, her kinswoman, as\nsoon as she saw that she had raised her eyes from the ground. \nFor all those of the race of Helios were plain to discern, since\nby the far flashing of their eyes they shot in front of them a\ngleam as of gold.  So Medea told her all she asked–the\ndaughter of Aeetes of the gloomy heart, speaking gently in the\nColchian tongue, both of the quest and the journeyings of the\nheroes, and of their toils in the swift contests, and how she had\nsinned through the counsels of her much-sorrowing sister, and how\nwith the sons of Phrixus she had fled afar from the tyrannous\nhorrors of her father; but she shrank from telling of the murder\nof Apsyrtus.  Yet she escaped not Circe’s ken; nevertheless, in\nspite of all, she pitied the weeping maiden, and spake thus:",
        "(ll. 739-748)  “Poor wretch, an evil and shameful return hast\nthou planned.  Not for long, I ween, wilt thou escape the heavy\nwrath of Aeetes; but soon will he go even to the dwellings of\nHellas to avenge the blood of his son, for intolerable are the\ndeeds thou hast done.  But since thou art my suppliant and my\nkinswoman, no further ill shall I devise against thee at thy\ncoming; but begone from my halls, companioning the stranger,\nwhosoever he be, this unknown one that thou hast taken in thy\nfather’s despite; and kneel not to me at my hearth, for never\nwill I approve thy counsels and thy shameful flight.”",
        "(ll. 749-752)  Thus she spake, and measureless anguish seized the\nmaid; and over her eyes she cast her robe and poured forth a\nlamentation, until the hero took her by the hand and led her\nforth from the hall quivering with fear.  So they left the home\nof Circe.",
        "(ll. 753-756)  But they were not unmarked by the spouse of Zeus,\nson of Cronos; but Iris told her when she saw them faring from\nthe hall.  For Hera had bidden her watch what time they should\ncome to the ship; so again she urged her and spake:",
        "(ll. 757-769)  “Dear Iris, now come, if ever thou hast fulfilled\nmy bidding, hie thee away on light pinions, and bid Thetis arise\nfrom the sea and come hither.  For need of her is come upon me.\nThen go to the sea-beaches where the bronze anvils of Hephaestus\nare smitten by sturdy hammers, and tell him to still the blasts\nof fire until Argo pass by them.  Then go to Aeolus too, Aeolus\nwho rules the winds, children of the clear sky; and to him also\ntell my purpose so that he may make all winds cease under heaven\nand no breeze may ruffle the sea; yet let the breath of the west \nwind blow until the heroes have reached the Phaeacian isle of\nAlcinous.”",
        "(ll. 770-782)  So she spake, and straightway Iris leapt down from\nOlympus and cleft her way, with light wings outspread.  And she\nplunged into the Aegean Sea, where is the dwelling of Nereus. \nAnd she came to Thetis first and, by the promptings of Hera, told\nher tale and roused her to go to the goddess.  Next she came to\nHephaestus, and quickly made him cease from the clang of his iron\nhammers; and the smoke-grimed bellows were stayed from their\nblast.  And thirdly she came to Aeolus, the famous son of\nHippotas.  And when she had given her message to him also and\nrested her swift knees from her course, then Thetis leaving\nNereus and her sisters had come from the sea to Olympus to the\ngoddess Hera; and the goddess made her sit by her side and\nuttered her word:",
        "(ll. 783-832)  “Hearken now, lady Thetis, to what I am eager to\ntell thee.  Thou knowest how honoured in my heart is the hero,\nAeson’s son, and the others that have helped him in the contest,\nand how I saved them when they passed between the Wandering\nrocks, (5) where roar terrible storms of fire and the waves foam\nround the rugged reefs.  And now past the mighty rock of Scylla\nand Charybdis horribly belching, a course awaits them.  But thee\nindeed from thy infancy did I tend with my own hands and love\nbeyond all others that dwell in the salt sea because thou didst\nrefuse to share the couch of Zeus, for all his desire.  For to\nhim such deeds are ever dear, to embrace either goddesses or\nmortal women.  But in reverence for me and with fear in thy heart\nthou didst shrink from his love; and he then swore a mighty oath\nthat thou shouldst never be called the bride of an immortal god.\nYet he ceased not from spying thee against thy will, until\nreverend Themis declared to him the whole truth, how that it was\nthy fate to bear a son mightier than his sire; wherefore he gave\nthee up, for all his desire, fearing lest another should be his\nmatch and rule the immortals, and in order that he might ever\nhold his own dominion.  But I gave thee the best of the sons of\nearth to be thy husband, that thou mightest find a marriage dear\nto thy heart and bear children; and I summoned to the feast the\ngods, one and all.  And with my own hand I raised the bridal\ntorch, in return for the kindly honour thou didst pay me.  But\ncome, let me tell a tale that erreth not.  When thy son shall\ncome to the Elysian plain, he whom now in the home of Cheiron the\nCentaur water-nymphs are tending, though he still craves thy\nmother milk, it is fated that he be the husband of Medea, Aeetes’\ndaughter; do thou aid thy daughter-in-law as a mother-in-law\nshould, and aid Peleus himself.  Why is thy wrath so steadfast?\nHe was blinded by folly.  For blindness comes even upon the gods.\nSurely at my behest I deem that Hephaestus will cease from\nkindling the fury of his flame, and that Aeolus, son of Hippotas,\nwill check his swift rushing winds, all but the steady west wind,\nuntil they reach the havens of the Phaeacians; do thou devise a\nreturn without bane.  The rocks and the tyrannous waves are my\nfear, they alone, and them thou canst foil with thy sisters’ aid.\nAnd let them not fall in their helplessness into Charybdis lest\nshe swallow them at one gulp, or approach the hideous lair of\nScylla, Ausonian Scylla the deadly, whom night-wandering Hecate,\nwho is called Crataeis, (6) bare to Phoreys, lest swooping upon\nthem with her horrible jaws she destroy the chiefest of the\nheroes.  But guide their ship in the course where there shall be\nstill a hair’s breadth escape from destruction.”",
        "(ll. 833-841)  Thus she spake, and Thetis answered with these\nwords: “If the fury of the ravening flame and the stormy winds\ncease in very deed, surely will I promise boldly to save the\nship, even though the waves bar the way, if only the west wind\nblows fresh and clear.  But it is time to fare on a long and\nmeasureless path, in quest of my sisters who will aid me, and to\nthe spot where the ship’s hawsers are fastened, that at early\ndawn the heroes may take thought to win their home-return.”",
        "(ll. 842-855)  She spake, and darting down from the sky fell amid\nthe eddies of the dark blue sea; and she called to aid her the\nrest of the Nereids, her own sisters; and they heard her and\ngathered together; and Thetis declared to them Hera’s behests,\nand quickly sped them all on their way to the Ausonian sea.  And\nherself, swifter than the flash of an eye or the shafts of the\nsun, when it rises upwards from a far-distant land, hastened\nswiftly through the sea, until she reached the Aeaean beach of\nthe Tyrrhenian mainland.  And the heroes she found by the ship\ntaking their pastime with quoits and shooting of arrows; and she\ndrew near and just touched the hand of Aeaeus’ son Peleus, for he\nwas her husband; nor could anyone see her clearly, but she\nappeared to his eyes alone, and thus addressed him:",
        "(ll. 856-864)  “No longer now must ye stay sitting on the\nTyrrhenian beach, but at dawn loosen the hawsers of your swift\nship, in obedience to Hera, your helper.  For at her behest the\nmaiden daughters of Nereus have met together to draw your ship\nthrough the midst of the rocks which are called Planctae, (7) for\nthat is your destined path.  But do thou show my person to no\none, when thou seest us come to meet time, but keep it secret in\nthy mind, lest thou anger me still more than thou didst anger me\nbefore so recklessly.”",
        "(ll. 865-884)  She spake, and vanished into the depths of the\nsea; but sharp pain smote Peleus, for never before had he seen\nher come, since first she left her bridal chamber and bed in\nanger, on account of noble Achilles, then a babe.  For she ever\nencompassed the child’s mortal flesh in the night with the flame\nof fire; and day by day she anointed with ambrosia his tender\nframe, so that he might become immortal and that she might keep\noff from his body loathsome old age.  But Peleus leapt up from\nhis bed and saw his dear son gasping in the flame; and at the\nsight he uttered a terrible cry, fool that he was; and she heard\nit, and catching up the child threw him screaming to the ground,\nand herself like a breath of wind passed swiftly from the hall as\na dream and leapt into the sea, exceeding wroth, and thereafter\nreturned not again.  Wherefore blank amazement fettered his soul;\nnevertheless he declared to his comrades all the bidding of\nThetis.  And they broke off in the midst and hurriedly ceased\ntheir contests, and prepared their meal and earth-strewn beds,\nwhereon after supper they slept through the night as aforetime.",
        "(ll. 885-921)  Now when dawn the light-bringer was touching the\nedge of heaven, then at the coming of the swift west wind they\nwent to their thwarts from the land; and gladly did they draw up\nthe anchors from the deep and made the tackling ready in due\norder; and above spread the sail, stretching it taut with the\nsheets from the yard-arm.  And a fresh breeze wafted the ship on.\nAnd soon they saw a fair island, Anthemoessa, where the clear-\nvoiced Sirens, daughters of Achelous, used to beguile with their\nsweet songs whoever cast anchor there, and then destroy him. \nThem lovely Terpsichore, one of the Muses, bare, united with\nAchelous; and once they tended Demeter’s noble daughter still\nunwed, and sang to her in chorus; and at that time they were\nfashioned in part like birds and in part like maidens to behold.\nAnd ever on the watch from their place of prospect with its fair\nhaven, often from many had they taken away their sweet return,\nconsuming them with wasting desire; and suddenly to the heroes,\ntoo, they sent forth from their lips a lily-like voice.  And they\nwere already about to cast from the ship the hawsers to the\nshore, had not Thracian Orpheus, son of Oeagrus, stringing in his\nhands his Bistonian lyre, rung forth the hasty snatch of a\nrippling melody so that their ears might be filled with the sound\nof his twanging; and the lyre overcame the maidens’ voice.  And\nthe west wind and the sounding wave rushing astern bore the ship\non; and the Sirens kept uttering their ceaseless song.  But even\nso the goodly son of Teleon alone of the comrades leapt before\nthem all from the polished bench into the sea, even Butes, his\nsoul melted by the clear ringing voice of the Sirens; and he swam\nthrough the dark surge to mount the beach, poor wretch.  Quickly\nwould they have robbed him of his return then and there, but the\ngoddess that rules Eryx, Cypris, in pity snatched him away, while\nyet in the eddies, and graciously meeting him saved him to dwell\non the Lilybean height.  And the heroes, seized by anguish, left\nthe Sirens, but other perils still worse, destructive to ships,\nawaited them in the meeting-place of the seas.",
        "(ll. 922-981)  For on one side appeared the smooth rock of\nScylla; on the other Charybdis ceaselessly spouted and roared; in\nanother part the Wandering rocks were booming beneath the mighty\nsurge, where before the burning flame spurted forth from the top\nof the crags, above the rock glowing with fire, and the air was\nmisty with smoke, nor could you have seen the sun’s light.  Then,\nthough Hephaestus had ceased from his toils, the sea was still\nsending up a warm vapour.  Hereupon on this side and on that the\ndaughters of Nereus met them; and behind, lady Thetis set her\nhand to the rudder-blade, to guide them amid the Wandering rocks.\nAnd as when in fair weather herds of dolphins come up from the\ndepths and sport in circles round a ship as it speeds along, now\nseen in front, now behind, now again at the side and delight\ncomes to the sailors; so the Nereids darted upward and circled in\ntheir ranks round the ship Argo, while Thetis guided its course.\nAnd when they were about to touch the Wandering rocks,\nstraightway they raised the edge of their garments over their\nsnow-white knees, and aloft, on the very rocks and where the\nwaves broke, they hurried along on this side and on that apart\nfrom one another.  And the ship was raised aloft as the current\nsmote her, and all around the furious wave mounting up broke over\nthe rocks, which at one time touched the sky like towering crags,\nat another, down in the depths, were fixed fast at the bottom of\nthe sea and the fierce waves poured over them in floods.  And the\nNereids, even as maidens near some sandy beach roll their\ngarments up to their waists out of their way and sport with a\nshapely-rounded ball; then they catch it one from another and\nsend it high into the air; and it never touches the ground; so\nthey in turn one from another sent the ship through the air over\nthe waves, as it sped on ever away from the rocks; and round them\nthe water spouted and foamed.  And lord Hephaestus himself\nstanding on the summit of a smooth rock and resting his massy\nshoulder on the handle of his hammer, beheld them, and the spouse\nof Zeus beheld them as she stood above the gleaming heaven; and\nshe threw her arms round Athena, such fear seized her as she\ngazed.  And as long as the space of a day is lengthened out in\nspringtime, so long a time did they toil, heaving the ship\nbetween the loud-echoing rocks; then again the heroes caught the\nwind and sped onward; and swiftly they passed the mead of\nThrinacia, where the kine of Helios fed.  There the nymphs, like\nsea-mews, plunged beneath the depths, when they had fulfilled the\nbehests of the spouse of Zeus.  And at the same time the bleating\nof sheep came to the heroes through the mist and the lowing of\nkine, near at hand, smote their ears.  And over the dewy leas\nPhaethusa, the youngest of the daughters of Helios, tended the\nsheep, bearing in her hand a silver crook; while Lampetia,\nherding the kine, wielded a staff of glowing orichalcum (8) as\nshe followed.  These kine the heroes saw feeding by the river’s\nstream, over the plain and the water-meadow; not one of them was\ndark in hue but all were white as milk and glorying in their\nhorns of gold.  So they passed them by in the day-time, and when\nnight came on they were cleaving a great sea-gulf, rejoicing,\nuntil again early rising dawn threw light upon their course.",
        "(ll. 982-1013)  Fronting the Ionian gulf there lies an island in\nthe Ceraunian sea, rich in soil, with a harbour on both sides,\nbeneath which lies the sickle, as legend saith–grant me grace,\nO Muses, not willingly do I tell this tale of olden days –\nwherewith Cronos pitilessly mutilated his father; but others call\nit the reaping-hook of Demeter, goddess of the nether world.  For\nDemeter once dwelt in that island, and taught the Titans to reap\nthe ears of corn, all for the love of Macris.  Whence it is\ncalled Drepane, (9) the sacred nurse of the Phaeacians; and thus\nthe Phaeacians themselves are by birth of the blood of Uranus. \nTo them came Argo, held fast by many toils, borne by the breezes\nfrom the Thrinacian sea; and Alcinous and his people with kindly\nsacrifice gladly welcomed their coming; and over them all the\ncity made merry; thou wouldst say they were rejoicing over their\nown sons.  And the heroes themselves strode in gladness through\nthe throng, even as though they had set foot in the heart of\nHaemonia; but soon were they to arm and raise the battle-cry; so\nnear to them appeared a boundless host of Colchians, who had\npassed through the mouth of Pontus and between the Cyanean rocks\nin search of the chieftains.  They desired forthwith to carry off\nMedea to her father’s house apart from the rest, or else they\nthreatened with fierce cruelty to raise the dread war-cry both\nthen and thereafter on the coming of Aeetes.  But lordly Alcinous\nchecked them amid their eagerness for war.  For he longed to\nallay the lawless strife between both sides without the clash of\nbattle.  And the maiden in deadly fear often implored the\ncomrades of Aeson’s son, and often with her hands touched the\nknees of Arete, the bride of Aleinous:",
        "(ll. 1014-1028)  “I beseech thee, O queen, be gracious and\ndeliver me not to the Colchians to be borne to my father, if thou\nthyself too art one of the race of mortals, whose heart rushes\nswiftly to ruin from light transgressions.  For my firm sense\nforsook me–it was not for wantonness.  Be witness the sacred\nlight of Helios, be witness the rites of the maiden that wanders\nby night, daughter of Perses.  Not willingly did I haste from my\nhome with men of an alien race; but a horrible fear wrought on me\nto bethink me of flight when I sinned; other device was there\nnone.  Still my maiden’s girdle remains, as in the halls of my\nfather, unstained, untouched.  Pity me, lady, and turn thy lord\nto mercy; and may the immortals grant thee a perfect life, and\njoy, and children, and the glory of a city unravaged!”",
        "(ll. 1029-1030)  Thus did she implore Arete, shedding tears, and\nthus each of the chieftains in turn:",
        "(ll. 1031-1052)  “On your account, ye men of peerless might, and\non account of my toils in your ventures am I sorely afflicted;\neven I, by whose help ye yoked the bulls, and reaped the deadly\nharvest of the earthborn men; even I, through whom on your\nhomeward path ye shall bear to Haemonia the golden fleece.  Lo,\nhere am I, who have lost my country and my parents, who have lost\nmy home and all the delights of life; to you have I restored your\ncountry and your homes; with eyes of gladness ye will see again\nyour parents; but from me a heavy-handed god has raft all joy;\nand with strangers I wander, an accursed thing.  Fear your\ncovenant and your oaths, fear the Fury that avenges suppliants\nand the retribution of heaven, if I fall into Aeetes’ hands and\nam slain with grievous outrage.  To no shrines, no tower of\ndefence, no other refuge do I pay heed, but only to you.  Hard\nand pitiless in your cruelty!  No reverence have ye for me in\nyour heart though ye see me helpless, stretching my hands towards\nthe knees of a stranger queen; yet, when ye longed to seize the\nfleece, ye would have met all the Colchians face to thee and\nhaughty Aeetes himself; but now ye have forgotten your courage,\nnow that they are all alone and cut off.”",
        "(ll. 1053-1067)  Thus she spake, beseeching; and to whomsoever\nshe bowed in prayer, that man tried to give her heart and to\ncheck her anguish.  And in their hands they shook their sharp\npointed spears, and drew the swords from their sheaths; and they\nswore they would not hold back from giving succour, if she should\nmeet with an unrighteous judgement.  And the host were all\nwearied and Night came on them, Night that puts to rest the works\nof men, and lulled all the earth to sleep; but to the maid no\nsleep brought rest, but in her bosom her heart was wrung with\nanguish.  Even as when a toiling woman turns her spindle through\nthe night, and round her moan her orphan children, for she is a\nwidow, and down her cheeks fall the tears, as she bethinks her\nhow dreary a lot hath seized her; so Medea’s cheeks were wet; and\nher heart within her was in agony, pierced with sharp pain.",
        "(ll. 1068-1072)  Now within the palace in the city, as aforetime,\nlay lordly Alcinous and Arete, the revered wife of Alcinous, and\non their couch through the night they were devising plans about\nthe maiden; and him, as her wedded husband, the wife addressed\nwith loving words:",
        "(ll. 1073-1095)  “Yea, my friend, come, save the woe-stricken\nmaid from the Colchians and show grace to the Minyae.  Argos is\nnear our isle and the men of Haemonia; but Aeetes dwells not\nnear, nor do we know of Aeetes one whit: we hear but his name;\nbut this maiden of dread suffering hath broken my heart by her\nprayers.  O king, give her not up to the Colchians to be borne\nback to her father’s home.  She was distraught when first she\ngave him the drugs to charm the oxen; and next, to cure one ill\nby another, as in our sinning we do often, she fled from her\nhaughty sire’s heavy wrath.  But Jason, as I hear, is bound to\nher by mighty oaths that he will make her his wedded wife within\nhis halls.  Wherefore, my friend, make not, of thy will, Aeson’s\nson to be forsworn, nor let the father, if thou canst help, work\nwith angry heart some intolerable mischief on his child.  For\nfathers are all too jealous against their children; what wrong\ndid Nycteus devise against Antiope, fair of face!  What woes did\nDanae endure on the wide sea through her sire’s mad rage!  Of\nlate, and not far away, Echetus in wanton cruelty thrust spikes\nof bronze in his daughter’s eyes; and by a grievous fate is she\nwasting away, grinding grains of bronze in a dungeon’s gloom.”",
        "(ll. 1096-1097)  Thus she spake, beseeching; and by his wife’s\nwords his heart was softened, and thus he spake:",
        "(ll. 1098-1109)  “Arete, with arms I could drive forth the\nColchians, showing grace to the heroes for the maiden’s sake. \nBut I fear to set at nought the righteous judgment of Zeus.  Nor\nis it well to take no thought of Aeetes, as thou sayest: for none\nis more lordly than Aeetes.  And, if he willed, he might bring\nwar upon Hellas, though he dwell afar.  Wherefore it is right for\nme to deliver the judgement that in all men’s eyes shall be best;\nand I will not hide it from thee.  If she be yet a maid I decree\nthat they carry her back to her father; but if she shares a\nhusband’s bed, I will not separate her from her lord; nor, if she\nbear a child beneath her breast, will I give it up to an enemy.”",
        "(ll. 1110-1120)  Thus he spake, and at once sleep laid him to\nrest.  And she stored up in her heart the word of wisdom, and\nstraightway rose from her couch and went through the palace; and\nher handmaids came hasting together, eagerly tending their\nmistress.  But quietly she summoned her herald and addressed him,\nin her prudence urging Aeson’s son to wed the maiden, and not to\nimplore Alcinous; for he himself, she said, will decree to the\nColchians that if she is still a maid he will deliver her up to\nbe borne to her father’s house, but that if she shares a\nhusband’s bed he will not sever her from wedded love.",
        "(ll. 1121-1127)  Thus she spake, and quickly from the hall his\nfeet bore him, that he might declare to Jason the fair-omened\nspeech of Arete and the counsel of godfearing Alcinous.  And he\nfound the heroes watching in full armour in the haven of Hyllus,\nnear the city; and out he spake the whole message; and each\nhero’s heart rejoiced; for the word that he spake was welcome.",
        "(ll. 1128-1169)  And straightway they mingled a bowl to the\nblessed ones, as is right, and reverently led sheep to the altar,\nand for that very night prepared for the maiden the bridal couch\nin the sacred cave, where once dwelt Macris, the daughter of\nAristaeus, lord of honey, who discovered the works of bees and\nthe fatness of the olive, the fruit of labour.  She it was that\nfirst received in her bosom the Nysean son of Zeus in Abantian\nEuboea, and with honey moistened his parched lips when Hermes\nbore him out of the flame.  And Hera beheld it, and in wrath\ndrove her from the whole island.  And she accordingly came to\ndwell far off, in the sacred cave of the Phaeacians, and granted\nboundless wealth to the inhabitants.  There at that time did they\nspread a mighty couch; and thereon they laid the glittering\nfleece of gold, that so the marriage might be made honoured and\nthe theme of song.  And for them nymphs gathered flowers of\nvaried hue and bore them thither in their white bosoms; and a\nsplendour as of flame played round them all, such a light gleamed\nfrom the golden tufts.  And in their eyes it kindled a sweet\nlonging; yet for all her desire, awe withheld each one from\nlaying her hand thereon.  Some were called daughters of the river\nAegaeus; others dwelt round the crests of the Meliteian mount;\nand others were woodland nymphs from the plains.  For Hera\nherself, the spouse of Zeus, had sent them to do honour to Jason.\nThat cave is to this day called the sacred cave of Medea, where\nthey spread the fine and fragrant linen and brought these two\ntogether.  And the heroes in their hands wielded their spears for\nwar, lest first a host of foes should burst upon them for battle\nunawares, and, their heads enwreathed with leafy sprays, all in\nharmony, while Orpheus’ harp rang clear, sang the marriage song\nat the entrance to the bridal chamber.  Yet not in the house of\nAlcinous was the hero, Aeson’s son, minded to complete his\nmarriage, but in his father’s hall when he had returned home to\nIoleus; and such was the mind of Medea herself; but necessity led\nthem to wed at this time.  For never in truth do we tribes of\nwoe-stricken mortals tread the path of delight with sure foot;\nbut still some bitter affliction keeps pace with our joy.\nWherefore they too, though their souls were melted with sweet\nlove, were held by fear, whether the sentence of Alcinous would\nbe fulfilled.",
        "(ll. 1170-1227)  Now dawn returning with her beams divine\nscattered the gloomy night through the sky; and the island\nbeaches laughed out and the paths over the plains far off,\ndrenched with dew, and there was a din in the streets; the people\nwere astir throughout the city, and far away the Colchians were\nastir at the bounds of the isle of Macris.  And straightway to\nthem went Alcinous, by reason of his covenant, to declare his\npurpose concerning the maiden, and in his hand he held a golden\nstaff, his staff of justice, whereby the people had righteous\njudgments meted out to them throughout the city.  And with him in\norder due and arrayed in their harness of war went marching, band\nby band, the chiefs of the Phaeacians.  And from the towers came\nforth the women in crowds to gaze upon the heroes; and the\ncountry folk came to meet them when they heard the news, for Hera\nhad sent forth a true report.  And one led the chosen ram of his\nflock, and another a heifer that had never toiled; and others set\nhard by jars of wine for mixing; and the smoke of sacrifice leapt\nup far away.  And women bore fine linen, the fruit of much toil,\nas women will, and gifts of gold and varied ornaments as well,\nsuch as are brought to newly-wedded brides; and they marvelled\nwhen they saw the shapely forms and beauty of the gallant heroes,\nand among them the son of Oeagrus, oft beating the ground with\ngleaming sandal, to the time of his loud-ringing lyre and song.\nAnd all the nymphs together, whenever he recalled the marriage,\nuplifted the lovely bridal-chant; and at times again they sang\nalone as they circled in the dance, Hera, in thy honour; for it\nwas thou that didst put it into the heart of Arete to proclaim\nthe wise word of Alcinous.  And as soon as he had uttered the\ndecree of his righteous judgement, and the completion of the\nmarriage had been proclaimed, he took care that thus it should\nabide fixed; and no deadly fear touched him nor Aeetes’ grievous\nwrath, but he kept his judgement fast bound by unbroken oaths. \nSo when the Colchians learnt that they were beseeching in vain\nand he bade them either observe his judgements or hold their\nships away from his harbours and land, then they began to dread\nthe threats of their own king and besought Alcinous to receive\nthem as comrades; and there in the island long time they dwelt\nwith the Phaeacians, until in the course of years, the\nBacchiadae, a race sprung from Ephyra, (10) settled among them;\nand the Colchians passed to an island opposite; and thence they\nwere destined to reach the Ceraunian hills of the Abantes, and\nthe Nestaeans and Oricum; but all this was fulfilled after long\nages had passed.  And still the altars which Medea built on the\nspot sacred to Apollo, god of shepherds, receive yearly\nsacrifices in honour of the Fates and the Nymphs.  And when the\nMinyae departed many gifts of friendship did Alcinous bestow, and\nmany Arete; moreover she gave Medea twelve Phaeacian handmaids\nfrom the palace, to bear her company.  And on the seventh day\nthey left Drepane; and at dawn came a fresh breeze from Zeus. \nAnd onward they sped borne along by the wind’s breath.  Howbeit\nnot yet was it ordained for the heroes to set foot on Achaea,\nuntil they had toiled even in the furthest bounds of Libya.",
        "(ll. 1228-1250)  Now had they left behind the gulf named after\nthe Ambracians, now with sails wide spread the land of the\nCuretes, and next in order the narrow islands with the Echinades,\nand the land of Pelops was just descried; even then a baleful\nblast of the north wind seized them in mid-course and swept them\ntowards the Libyan sea nine nights and as many days, until they\ncame far within Syrtis, wherefrom is no return for ships, when\nthey are once forced into that gulf.  For on every hand are\nshoals, on every hand masses of seaweed from the depths; and over\nthem the light foam of the wave washes without noise; and there\nis a stretch of sand to the dim horizon; and there moveth nothing\nthat creeps or flies.  Here accordingly the flood-tide–for\nthis tide often retreats from the land and bursts back again over\nthe beach coming on with a rush and roar–thrust them suddenly\non to the innermost shore, and but little of the keel was left in\nthe water.  And they leapt forth from the ship, and sorrow seized\nthem when they gazed on the mist and the levels of vast land\nstretching far like a mist and continuous into the distance; no\nspot for water, no path, no steading of herdsmen did they descry\nafar off, but all the scene was possessed by a dead calm.  And\nthus did one hero, vexed in spirit, ask another:",
        "(ll. 1251-1258)  “What land is this?  Whither has the tempest\nhurled us?  Would that, reckless of deadly fear, we had dared to\nrush on by that same path between the clashing rocks!  Better\nwere it to have overleapt the will of Zeus and perished in\nventuring some mighty deed.  But now what should we do, held back\nby the winds to stay here, if ever so short a time?  How desolate\nlooms before us the edge of the limitless land!”",
        "(ll. 1259-1276)  Thus one spake; and among them Ancaeus the\nhelmsman, in despair at their evil case, spoke with grieving\nheart: “Verily we are undone by a terrible doom; there is no\nescape from ruin; we must suffer the cruellest woes, having\nfallen on this desolation, even though breezes should blow from\nthe land; for, as I gaze far around, on every side do I behold a\nsea of shoals, and masses of water, fretted line upon line, run\nover the hoary sand.  And miserably long ago would our sacred\nship have been shattered far from the shore; but the tide itself\nbore her high on to the land from the deep sea.  But now the tide\nrushes back to the sea, and only the foam, whereon no ship can\nsail, rolls round us, just covering the land.  Wherefore I deem\nthat all hope of our voyage and of our return is cut off.  Let\nsomeone else show his skill; let him sit at the helm the man that\nis eager for our deliverance.  But Zeus has no will to fulfil our\nday of return after all our toils.”",
        "(ll. 1277-1317)  Thus he spake with tears, and all of them that\nhad knowledge of ships agreed thereto; but the hearts of all grew\nnumb, and pallor overspread their cheeks.  And as, like lifeless\nspectres, men roam through a city awaiting the issue of war or of\npestilence, or some mighty storm which overwhelms the countless\nlabours of oxen, when the images of their own accord sweat and\nrun down with blood, and bellowings are heard in temples, or when\nat mid-day the sun draws on night from heaven, and the stars\nshine clear through the mist; so at that time along the endless\nstrand the chieftains wandered, groping their way.  Then\nstraightway dark evening came upon them; and piteously did they\nembrace each other and say farewell with tears, that they might,\neach one apart from his fellow, fall on the sand and die.  And\nthis way and that they went further to choose a resting-place;\nand they wrapped their heads in their cloaks and, fasting and\nunfed, lay down all that night and the day, awaiting a piteous\ndeath.  But apart the maidens huddled together lamented beside\nthe daughter of Aeetes.  And as when, forsaken by their mother,\nunfledged birds that have fallen from a cleft in the rock chirp\nshrilly; or when by the banks of fair-flowing Pactolus, swans\nraise their song, and all around the dewy meadow echoes and the\nriver’s fair stream; so these maidens, laying in the dust their\ngolden hair, all through the night wailed their piteous lament.\nAnd there all would have parted from life without a name and\nunknown to mortal men, those bravest of heroes, with their task\nunfulfilled; but as they pined in despair, the heroine-nymphs,\nwarders of Libya, had pity on them, they who once found Athena,\nwhat time she leapt in gleaming armour from her father’s head,\nand bathed her by Trito’s waters.  It was noon-tide and the\nfiercest rays of the sun were scorching Libya; they stood near\nAeson’s son, and lightly drew the cloak from his head.  And the\nhero cast down his eyes and looked aside, in reverence for the\ngoddesses, and as he lay bewildered all alone they addressed him\nopenly with gentle words:",
        "(ll. 1318-1329)  “Ill-starred one, why art thou so smitten with\ndespair?  We know how ye went in quest of the golden fleece; we\nknow each toil of yours, all the mighty deeds ye wrought in your\nwanderings over land and sea.  We are the solitary ones,\ngoddesses of the land, speaking with human voice, the heroines,\nLibya’s warders and daughters.  Up then; be not thus afflicted in\nthy misery, and rouse thy comrades.  And when Amphitrite has\nstraightway loosed Poseidon’s swift-wheeled car, then do ye pay\nto your mother a recompense for all her travail when she bare you\nso long in her womb; and so ye may return to the divine land of\nAchaea.”",
        "(ll. 1330-1332)  Thus they spake, and with the voice vanished at\nonce, where they stood.  But Jason sat upon the earth as he gazed\naround, and thus cried:",
        "(ll. 1333-1336)  “Be gracious, noble goddesses of the desert, yet\nthe saying about our return I understand not clearly.  Surely I\nwill gather together my comrades and tell them, if haply we can\nfind some token of our escape, for the counsel of many is\nbetter.”",
        "(ll. 1337-1346)  He spake, and leapt to his feet, and shouted\nafar to his comrades, all squalid with dust, like a lion when he\nroars through the woodland seeking his mate; and far off in the\nmountains the glens tremble at the thunder of his voice; and the\noxen of the field and the herdsmen shudder with fear; yet to them\nJason’s voice was no whit terrible the voice of a comrade calling\nto his friends.  And with looks downcast they gathered near, and\nhard by where the ship lay he made them sit down in their grief\nand the women with them, and addressed them and told them\neverything:",
        "(ll. 1347-1362)  “Listen, friends; as I lay in my grief, three\ngoddesses girded with goat-skins from the neck downwards round\nthe back and waist, like maidens, stood over my head nigh at\nhand; and they uncovered me, drawing my cloak away with light\nhand, and they bade me rise up myself and go and rouse you, and\npay to our mother a bounteous recompense for all her travail when\nshe bare us so long in her womb, when Amphitrite shall have\nloosed Poseidon’s swift-wheeled car.  But I cannot fully\nunderstand concerning this divine message.  They said indeed that\nthey were heroines, Libya’s warders and daughters; and all the\ntoils that we endured aforetime by land and sea, all these they\ndeclared that they knew full well.  Then I saw them no more in\ntheir place, but a mist or cloud came between and hid them from\nmy sight.”",
        "(ll. 1363-1369)  Thus he spake, and all marvelled as they heard.\nThen was wrought for the Minyae the strangest of portents.  From\nthe sea to the land leapt forth a monstrous horse, of vast size,\nwith golden mane tossing round his neck; and quickly from his\nlimbs he shook off abundant spray and started on his course, with\nfeet like the wind.  And at once Peleus rejoiced and spake among\nthe throng of his comrades:",
        "(ll. 1370-1379)  “I deem that Poseidon’s ear has even now been\nloosed by the hands of his dear wife, and I divine that our\nmother is none else than our ship herself; for surely she bare us\nin her womb and groans unceasingly with grievous travailing.  But\nwith unshaken strength and untiring shoulders will we lift her up\nand bear her within this country of sandy wastes, where yon\nswift-footed steed has sped before.  For he will not plunge\nbeneath the earth; and his hoof-prints, I ween, will point us to\nsome bay above the sea.”",
        "(ll. 1380-1392)  Thus he spake, and the fit counsel pleased all.\nThis is the tale the Muses told; and I sing obedient to the\nPierides, and this report have I heard most truly; that ye, O\nmightiest far of the sons of kings, by your might and your valour\nover the desert sands of Libya raised high aloft on your\nshoulders the ship and all that ye brought therein, and bare her\ntwelve days and nights alike.  Yet who could tell the pain and\ngrief which they endured in that toil?  Surely they were of the\nblood of the immortals, such a task did they take on them,\nconstrained by necessity.  How forward and how far they bore her\ngladly to the waters of the Tritonian lake!  How they strode in\nand set her down from their stalwart shoulders!",
        "(ll. 1393-1421)  Then, like raging hounds, they rushed to search\nfor a spring; for besides their suffering and anguish, a parching\nthirst lay upon them, and not in vain did they wander; but they\ncame to the sacred plain where Ladon, the serpent of the land,\ntill yesterday kept watch over the golden apples in the garden of\nAtlas; and all around the nymphs, the Hesperides, were busied,\nchanting their lovely song.  But at that time, stricken by\nHeracles, he lay fallen by the trunk of the apple-tree; only the\ntip of his tail was still writhing; but from his head down his\ndark spine he lay lifeless; and where the arrows had left in his\nblood the bitter gall of the Lernaean hydra, flies withered and\ndied over the festering wounds.  And close at hand the\nHesperides, their white arms flung over their golden heads,\nlamented shrilly; and the heroes drew near suddenly; but the\nmaidens, at their quick approach, at once became dust and earth\nwhere they stood.  Orpheus marked the divine portent, and for his\ncomrades addressed them in prayer: “O divine ones, fair and kind,\nbe gracious, O queens, whether ye be numbered among the heavenly\ngoddesses, or those beneath the earth, or be called the Solitary\nnymphs; come, O nymphs, sacred race of Oceanus, appear manifest\nto our longing eyes and show us some spring of water from the\nrock or some sacred flow gushing from the earth, goddesses,\nwherewith we may quench the thirst that burns us unceasingly. \nAnd if ever again we return in our voyaging to the Achaean land,\nthen to you among the first of goddesses with willing hearts will\nwe bring countless gifts, libations and banquets.”",
        "(ll. 1422-1431)  So he spake, beseeching them with plaintive\nvoice; and they from their station near pitied their pain; and\nlo!  First of all they caused grass to spring from the earth; and\nabove the grass rose up tall shoots, and then flourishing\nsaplings grew standing upright far above the earth.  Hespere\nbecame a poplar and Eretheis an elm, and Aegle a willow’s sacred\ntrunk.  And forth from these trees their forms looked out, as\nclear as they were before, a marvel exceeding great, and Aegle\nspake with gentle words answering their longing looks:",
        "(ll. 1432-1449)  “Surely there has come hither a mighty succour\nto your toils, that most accursed man, who robbed our guardian\nserpent of life and plucked the golden apples of the goddesses\nand is gone; and has left bitter grief for us.  For yesterday\ncame a man most fell in wanton violence, most grim in form; and\nhis eyes flashed beneath his scowling brow; a ruthless wretch;\nand he was clad in the skin of a monstrous lion of raw hide,\nuntanned; and he bare a sturdy bow of olive, and a bow, wherewith\nhe shot and killed this monster here.  So he too came, as one\ntraversing the land on foot, parched with thirst; and he rushed\nwildly through this spot, searching for water, but nowhere was he\nlike to see it.  Now here stood a rock near the Tritonian lake;\nand of his own device, or by the prompting of some god, he smote\nit below with his foot; and the water gushed out in full flow.\nAnd he, leaning both his hands and chest upon the ground, drank a\nhuge draught from the rifted rock, until, stooping like a beast\nof the field, he had satisfied his mighty maw.”",
        "(ll. 1450-1457)  Thus she spake; and they gladly with joyful\nsteps ran to the spot where Aegle had pointed out to them the\nspring, until they reached it.  And as when earth-burrowing ants\ngather in swarms round a narrow cleft, or when flies lighting\nupon a tiny drop of sweet honey cluster round with insatiate\neagerness; so at that time, huddled together, the Minyae thronged\nabout the spring from the rock.  And thus with wet lips one cried\nto another in his delight:",
        "(ll. 1458-1460)  “Strange!  In very truth Heracles, though far\naway, has saved his comrades, fordone with thirst.  Would that we\nmight find him on his way as we pass through the mainland!”",
        "(ll. 1461-1484)  So they spake, and those who were ready for this\nwork answered, and they separated this way and that, each\nstarting to search.  For by the night winds the footsteps had\nbeen effaced where the sand was stirred.  The two sons of Boreas\nstarted up, trusting in their wings; and Euphemus, relying on his\nswift feet, and Lynceus to cast far his piercing eyes; and with\nthem darted off Canthus, the fifth.  He was urged on by the doom\nof the gods and his own courage, that he might learn for certain\nfrom Heracles where he had left Polyphemus, son of Eilatus; for\nhe was minded to question him on every point concerning his\ncomrade.  But that hero had founded a glorious city among the\nMysians, and, yearning for his home-return, had passed far over\nthe mainland in search of Argo; and in time he reached the land\nof the Chalybes, who dwell near the sea; there it was that his\nfate subdued him.  And to him a monument stands under a tall\npoplar, just facing the sea.  But that day Lynceus thought he saw\nHeracles all alone, far off, over measureless land, as a man at\nthe month’s beginning sees, or thinks he sees, the moon through a\nbank of cloud.  And he returned and told his comrades that no\nother searcher would find Heracles on his way, and they also came\nback, and swift-footed Euphemus and the twin sons of Thracian\nBoreas, after a vain toil.",
        "(ll. 1485-1501)  But thee, Canthus, the fates of death seized in\nLibya.  On pasturing flocks didst thou light; and there followed\na shepherd who, in defence of his own sheep, while thou weft\nleading them off (11) to thy comrades in their need, slew thee by\nthe cast of a stone; for he was no weakling, Caphaurus, the\ngrandson of Lycoreian Phoebus and the chaste maiden Acacallis,\nwhom once Minos drove from home to dwell in Libya, his own\ndaughter, when she was bearing the gods’ heavy load; and she bare\nto Phoebus a glorious son, whom they call Amphithemis and\nGaramas.  And Amphithemis wedded a Tritonian nymph; and she bare\nto him Nasamon and strong Caphaurus, who on that day in defending\nhis sheep slew Canthus.  But he escaped not the chieftains’\navenging hands, when they learned the deed he had done.  And the\nMinyae, when they knew it, afterwards took up the corpse and\nburied it in the earth, mourning; and the sheep they took with\nthem.",
        "(ll. 1502-1536)  Thereupon on the same day a pitiless fate seized\nMopsus too, son of Ampycus; and he escaped not a bitter doom by\nhis prophesying; for there is no averting of death.  Now there\nlay in the sand, avoiding the midday heat, a dread serpent, too\nsluggish of his own will to strike at an unwilling foe, nor yet\nwould he dart full face at one that would shrink back.  But into\nwhatever of all living beings that life-giving earth sustains\nthat serpent once injects his black venom, his path to Hades\nbecomes not so much as a cubit’s length, not even if Paeeon, if\nit is right for me to say this openly, should tend him, when its\nteeth have only grazed the skin.  For when over Libya flew\ngodlike Perseus Eurymedon   for by that name his mother called\nhim–bearing to the king the Gorgon’s head newly severed, all\nthe drops of dark blood that fell to the earth, produced a brood\nof those serpents.  Now Mopsus stepped on the end of its spine,\nsetting thereon the sole of his left foot; and it writhed round\nin pain and bit and tore the flesh between the shin and the\nmuscles.  And Medea and her handmaids fled in terror; but Canthus\nbravely felt the bleeding wound; for no excessive pain harassed\nhim.  Poor wretch!  Already a numbness that loosed his limbs was\nstealing beneath his skin, and a thick mist was spreading over\nhis eyes.  Straightway his heavy limbs sank helplessly to the\nground and he grew cold; and his comrades and the hero, Aeson’s\nson, gathered round, marvelling at the close-coming doom.  Nor\nyet though dead might he lie beneath the sun even for a little\nspace.  For at once the poison began to rot his flesh within, and\nthe hair decayed and fell from the skin.  And quickly and in\nhaste they dug a deep grave with mattocks of bronze; and they\ntore their hair, the heroes and the maidens, bewailing the dead\nman’s piteous suffering; and when he had received due burial\nrites, thrice they marched round the tomb in full armour, and\nheaped above him a mound of earth.",
        "(ll. 1537-1553)  But when they had gone aboard, as the south wind\nblew over the sea, and they were searching for a passage to go\nforth from the Tritonian lake, for long they had no device, but\nall the day were borne on aimlessly.  And as a serpent goes\nwrithing along his crooked path when the sun’s fiercest rays\nscorch him; and with a hiss he turns his head to this side and\nthat, and in his fury his eyes glow like sparks of fire, until he\ncreeps to his lair through a cleft in the rock; so Argo seeking\nan outlet from the lake, a fairway for ships, wandered for a long\ntime.  Then straightway Orpheus bade them bring forth from the\nship Apollo’s massy tripod and offer it to the gods of the land\nas propitiation for their return.  So they went forth and set\nApollo’s gift on the shore; then before them stood, in the form\nof a youth, farswaying Triton, and he lifted a clod from the\nearth and offered it as a stranger’s gift, and thus spake:",
        "(ll. 1554-1561)  “Take it, friends, for no stranger’s gift of\ngreat worth have I here by me now to place in the hands of those\nwho beseech me.  But if ye are searching for a passage through\nthis sea, as often is the need of men passing through a strange\nland, I will declare it.  For my sire Poseidon has made me to be\nwell versed in this sea.  And I rule the shore if haply in your\ndistant land you have ever heard of Eurypylus, born in Libya, the\nhome of wild beasts.”",
        "(ll. 1562-1563)  Thus he spake, and readily Euphemus held out his\nhands towards the clod, and thus addressed him in reply:",
        "(ll. 1564-1570)  “If haply, hero, thou knowest aught of Apis (12)\nand the sea of Minos, tell us truly, who ask it of you.  For not\nof our will have we come hither, but by the stress of heavy\nstorms have we touched the borders of this land, and have borne\nour ship aloft on our shoulders to the waters of this lake over\nthe mainland, grievously burdened; and we know not where a\npassage shows itself for our course to the land of Pelops.”",
        "(ll. 1571-1585)  So he spake; and Triton stretched out his hand\nand showed afar the sea and the lake’s deep mouth, and then\naddressed them: “That is the outlet to the sea, where the deep\nwater lies unmoved and dark; on each side roll white breakers\nwith shining crests; and the way between for your passage out is\nnarrow.  And that sea stretches away in mist to the divine land\nof Pelops beyond Crete; but hold to the right, when ye have\nentered the swell of the sea from the lake, and steer your course\nhugging the land, as long as it trends to the north; but when the\ncoast bends, falling away in the other direction, then your\ncourse is safely laid for you if ye go straight forward from the\nprojecting cape.  But go in joy, and as for labour let there be\nno grieving that limbs in youthful vigour should still toil.”",
        "(ll. 1586-1596)  He spake with kindly counsel; and they at once\nwent aboard, intent to come forth from the lake by the use of\noars.  And eagerly they sped on; meanwhile Triton took up the\nmighty tripod, and they saw him enter the lake; but thereafter\ndid no one mark how he vanished so near them along with the\ntripod.  But their hearts were cheered, for that one of the\nblessed had met them in friendly guise.  And they bade Aeson’s\nson offer to him the choicest of the sheep and when he had slain\nit chant the hymn of praise.  And straightway he chose in haste\nand raising the victim slew it over the stern, and prayed with\nthese words:",
        "(ll. 1597-1600)  “Thou god, who hast manifested thyself on the\nborders of this land, whether the daughters born of the sea call\nthee Triton, the great sea-marvel, or Phoreys, or Nereus, be\ngracious, and grant the return home dear to our hearts.”",
        "(ll. 1601-1637)  He spake, and cut the victim’s throat over the\nwater and cast it from the stern.  And the god rose up from the\ndepths in form such as he really was.  And as when a man trains a\nswift steed for the broad race-course, and runs along, grasping\nthe bushy mane, while the steed follows obeying his master, and\nrears his neck aloft in his pride, and the gleaming bit rings\nloud as he champs it in his jaws from side to side; so the god,\nseizing hollow Argo’s keel, guided her onward to the sea.  And\nhis body, from the crown of his head, round his back and waist as\nfar as the belly, was wondrously like that of the blessed ones in\nform; but below his sides the tail of a sea monster lengthened\nfar, forking to this side and that; and he smote the surface of\nthe waves with the spines, which below parted into curving fins,\nlike the horns of the new moon.  And he guided Argo on until he\nsped her into the sea on her course; and quickly he plunged into\nthe vast abyss; and the heroes shouted when they gazed with their\neyes on that dread portent.  There is the harbour of Argo and\nthere are the signs of her stay, and altars to Poseidon and\nTriton; for during that day they tarried.  But at dawn with sails\noutspread they sped on before the breath of the west wind,\nkeeping the desert land on their right.  And on the next morn\nthey saw the headland and the recess of the sea, bending inward\nbeyond the jutting headland.  And straightway the west wind\nceased, and there came the breeze of the clear south wind; and\ntheir hearts rejoiced at the sound it made.  But when the sun\nsank and the star returned that bids the shepherd fold, which\nbrings rest to wearied ploughmen, at that time the wind died down\nin the dark night; so they furled the sails and lowered the tall\nmast and vigorously plied their polished oars all night and\nthrough the day, and again when the next night came on.  And\nrugged Carpathus far away welcomed them; and thence they were to\ncross to Crete, which rises in the sea above other islands.",
        "(ll. 1638-1653)  And Talos, the man of bronze, as he broke off\nrocks from the hard cliff, stayed them from fastening hawsers to\nthe shore, when they came to the roadstead of Dicte’s haven.  He\nwas of the stock of bronze, of the men sprung from ash-trees, the\nlast left among the sons of the gods; and the son of Cronos gave\nhim to Europa to be the warder of Crete and to stride round the\nisland thrice a day with his feet of bronze.  Now in all the rest\nof his body and limbs was he fashioned of bronze and\ninvulnerable; but beneath the sinew by his ankle was a blood-red\nvein; and this, with its issues of life and death, was covered by\na thin skin.  So the heroes, though outworn with toil, quickly\nbacked their ship from the land in sore dismay.  And now far from\nCrete would they have been borne in wretched plight, distressed\nboth by thirst and pain, had not Medea addressed them as they\nturned away:",
        "(ll. 1654-1658)  “Hearken to me.  For I deem that I alone can\nsubdue for you that man, whoever he be, even though his frame be\nof bronze throughout, unless his life too is everlasting.  But be\nready to keep your ship here beyond the cast of his stones, till\nhe yield the victory to me.”",
        "(ll. 1659-1672)  Thus she spake; and they drew the ship out of\nrange, resting on their oars, waiting to see what plan unlooked\nfor she would bring to pass; and she, holding the fold of her\npurple robe over her cheeks on each side, mounted on the deck;\nand Aeson’s son took her hand in his and guided her way along the\nthwarts.  And with songs did she propitiate and invoke the Death-\nspirits, devourers of life, the swift hounds of Hades, who,\nhovering through all the air, swoop down on the living.  Kneeling\nin supplication, thrice she called on them with songs, and thrice\nwith prayers; and, shaping her soul to mischief, with her hostile\nglance she bewitched the eyes of Talos, the man of bronze; and\nher teeth gnashed bitter wrath against him, and she sent forth\nbaneful phantoms in the frenzy of her rage.",
        "(ll. 1673-1693)  Father Zeus, surely great wonder rises in my\nmind, seeing that dire destruction meets us not from disease and\nwounds alone, but lo! even from afar, may be, it tortures us!  So\nTalos, for all his frame of bronze, yielded the victory to the\nmight of Medea the sorceress.  And as he was heaving massy rocks\nto stay them from reaching the haven, he grazed his ankle on a\npointed crag; and the ichor gushed forth like melted lead; and\nnot long thereafter did he stand towering on the jutting cliff.\nBut even as some huge pine, high up on the mountains, which\nwoodmen have left half hewn through by their sharp axes when they\nreturned from the forest–at first it shivers in the wind by\nnight, then at last snaps at the stump and crashes down; so Talos\nfor a while stood on his tireless feet, swaying to and fro, when\nat last, all strengthless, fell with a mighty thud.  For that\nnight there in Crete the heroes lay; then, just as dawn was\ngrowing bright, they built a shrine to Minoan Athena, and drew\nwater and went aboard, so that first of all they might by rowing\npass beyond Salmone’s height.",
        "(ll. 1694-1730)  But straightway as they sped over the wide\nCretan sea night scared them, that night which they name the Pall\nof Darkness; the stars pierced not that fatal night nor the beams\nof the moon, but black chaos descended from heaven, or haply some\nother darkness came, rising from the nethermost depths.  And the\nheroes, whether they drifted in Hades or on the waters, knew not\none whit; but they committed their return to the sea in helpless\ndoubt whither it was bearing them.  But Jason raised his hands\nand cried to Phoebus with mighty voice, calling on him to save\nthem; and the tears ran down in his distress; and often did he\npromise to bring countless offerings to Pytho, to Amyclae, and to\nOrtygia.  And quickly, O son of Leto, swift to hear, didst thou\ncome down from heaven to the Melantian rocks, which lie there in\nthe sea.  Then darting upon one of the twin peaks, thou raisedst\naloft in thy right hand thy golden bow; and the bow flashed a\ndazzling gleam all round.  And to their sight appeared a small\nisland of the Sporades, over against the tiny isle Hippuris, and\nthere they cast anchor and stayed; and straightway dawn arose and\ngave them light; and they made for Apollo a glorious abode in a\nshady wood, and a shady altar, calling on Phoebus the “Gleamer”,\nbecause of the gleam far-seen; and that bare island they called\nAnaphe, (13) for that Phoebus had revealed it to men sore\nbewildered.  And they sacrificed all that men could provide for\nsacrifice on a desolate strand; wherefore when Medea’s Phaeacian\nhandmaids saw them pouring water for libations on the burning\nbrands, they could no longer restrain laughter within their\nbosoms, for that ever they had seen oxen in plenty slain in the\nhalls of Alcinous.  And the heroes delighted in the jest and\nattacked them with taunting words; and merry railing and\ncontention flung to and fro were kindled among them.  And from\nthat sport of the heroes such scoffs do the women fling at the\nmen in that island whenever they propitiate with sacrifices\nApollo the gleaming god, the warder of Anaphe.",
        "(ll. 1731-1740)  But when they had loosed the hawsers thence in\nfair weather, then Euphemus bethought him of a dream of the\nnight, reverencing the glorious son of Maia.  For it seemed to\nhim that the god-given clod of earth held in his palm close to\nhis breast was being suckled by white streams of milk, and that\nfrom it, little though it was, grew a woman like a virgin; and\nhe, overcome by strong desire, lay with her in love’s embrace;\nand united with her he pitied her, as though she were a maiden\nwhom he was feeding with his own milk; but she comforted him with\ngentle words:",
        "(ll. 1741-1745)  “Daughter of Triton am I, dear friend, and nurse\nof thy children, no maiden; Triton and Libya are my parents.  But\nrestore me to the daughters of Nereus to dwell in the sea near\nAnaphe; I shall return again to the light of the sun, to prepare\na home for thy descendants.”",
        "(ll. 1746-1748)  Of this he stored in his heart the memory, and\ndeclared it to Aeson’s son; and Jason pondered a prophecy of the\nFar-Darter and lifted up his voice and said:",
        "(ll. 1749-1754)  “My friend, great and glorious renown has fallen\nto thy lot.  For of this clod when thou hast cast it into the\nsea, the gods will make an island, where thy children’s children\nshall dwell; for Triton gave this to thee as a stranger’s gift\nfrom the Libyan mainland.  None other of the immortals it was\nthan he that gave thee this when he met thee.”",
        "(ll. 1755-1764)  Thus he spake; and Euphemus made not vain the\nanswer of Aeson’s son; but, cheered by the prophecy, he cast the\nclod into the depths.  Therefrom rose up an island, Calliste,\nsacred nurse of the sons of Euphemus, who in former days dwelt in\nSintian Lemnos, and from Lemnos were driven forth by Tyrrhenians\nand came to Sparta as suppliants; and when they left Sparta,\nTheras, the goodly son of Autesion, brought them to the island\nCalliste, and from himself he gave it the name of Thera.  But\nthis befell after the days of Euphemus.",
        "(ll. 1765-1772)  And thence they steadily left behind long\nleagues of sea and stayed on the beach of Aegina; and at once\nthey contended in innocent strife about the fetching of water,\nwho first should draw it and reach the ship.  For both their need\nand the ceaseless breeze urged them on.  There even to this day \ndo the youths of the Myrmidons take up on their shoulders full-\nbrimming jars, and with swift feet strive for victory in the\nrace.",
        "(ll. 1773-1781)  Be gracious, race of blessed chieftains!  And\nmay these songs year after year be sweeter to sing among men. \nFor now have I come to the glorious end of your toils; for no\nadventure befell you as ye came home from Aegina, and no tempest\nof winds opposed you; but quietly did ye skirt the Cecropian land\nand Aulis inside of Euboea and the Opuntian cities of the\nLocrians, and gladly did ye step forth upon the beach of Pagasae.",
