        "[1] In one of his speeches a year or two ago, that fine speaker and\nfamous Liberal, Mr. Bright, took occasion to have a fling at the\nfriends and preachers of culture.  “People who talk about what they\ncall culture!” said he contemptuously; “by which they mean a\nsmattering of the two dead languages of Greek and Latin.”  And he\nwent on to remark, in a strain with which modern speakers and writers\nhave made us very familiar, how poor a thing this culture is, how\nlittle good it can do to the world, and how absurd it is for its\npossessors to set much [2] store by it.  And the other day a younger\nLiberal than Mr. Bright, one of a school whose mission it is to bring\ninto order and system that body of truth of which the earlier\nLiberals merely touched the outside, a member of the University of\nOxford, and a very clever writer, Mr. Frederic Harrison, developed,\nin the systematic and stringent manner of his school, the thesis\nwhich Mr. Bright had propounded in only general terms.  “Perhaps the\nvery silliest cant of the day,” said Mr. Frederic Harrison, “is the\ncant about culture.  Culture is a desirable quality in a critic of\nnew books, and sits well on a possessor of belles lettres; but as\napplied to politics, it means simply a turn for small fault-finding,\nlove of selfish ease, and indecision in action.  The man of culture\nis in politics one of the poorest mortals alive.  For simple pedantry\nand want of good sense no man is his equal.  No assumption is too\nunreal, no end is too unpractical for him.  But the active exercise\nof politics requires common sense, sympathy, trust, resolution and\nenthusiasm, qualities which your man of culture has carefully rooted\nup, lest they damage the delicacy of his critical olfactories.\nPerhaps they are the only class [3] of responsible beings in the\ncommunity who cannot with safety be entrusted with power.”",
        "Now for my part I do not wish to see men of culture asking to be\nentrusted with power; and, indeed, I have freely said, that in my\nopinion the speech most proper, at present, for a man of culture to\nmake to a body of his fellow-countrymen who get him into a committee-\nroom, is Socrates’s: Know thyself! and this is not a speech to be\nmade by men wanting to be entrusted with power.  For this very\nindifference to direct political action I have been taken to task by\nthe Daily Telegraph, coupled, by a strange perversity of fate, with\njust that very one of the Hebrew prophets whose style I admire the\nleast, and called “an elegant Jeremiah.”  It is because I say (to use\nthe words which the Daily Telegraph puts in my mouth):–\"You mustn’t\nmake a fuss because you have no vote,–that is vulgarity; you mustn’t\nhold big meetings to agitate for reform bills and to repeal corn\nlaws,–that is the very height of vulgarity,\"–it is for this reason\nthat I am called, sometimes an elegant Jeremiah, sometimes a spurious\nJeremiah, a Jeremiah about the reality of whose mission the writer in\nthe Daily [4] Telegraph has his doubts.  It is evident, therefore,\nthat I have so taken my line as not to be exposed to the whole brunt\nof Mr. Frederic Harrison’s censure.  Still, I have often spoken in\npraise of culture; I have striven to make all my works and ways serve\nthe interests of culture; I take culture to be something a great deal\nmore than what Mr. Frederic Harrison and others call it: “a desirable\nquality in a critic of new books.”  Nay, even though to a certain\nextent I am disposed to agree with Mr. Frederic Harrison, that men of\nculture are just the class of responsible beings in this community of\nours who cannot properly, at present, be entrusted with power, I am\nnot sure that I do not think this the fault of our community rather\nthan of the men of culture.  In short, although, like Mr. Bright and\nMr. Frederic Harrison, and the editor of the Daily Telegraph, and a\nlarge body of valued friends of mine, I am a liberal, yet I am a\nliberal tempered by experience, reflection, and renouncement, and I\nam, above all, a believer in culture.  Therefore I propose now to try\nand enquire, in the simple unsystematic way which best suits both my\ntaste and my powers, what culture really is, what good it [5] can do,\nwhat is our own special need of it; and I shall seek to find some\nplain grounds on which a faith in culture–both my own faith in it\nand the faith of others,–may rest securely.",
