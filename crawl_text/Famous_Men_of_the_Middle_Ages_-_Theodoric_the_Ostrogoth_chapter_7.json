        "The Ostrogoths, or East Goths, who had settled in Southern Russia,\nat length pushed southward and westward to the mouth of the Danube.",
        "They were continually invading countries belonging to the Romans\nand their warlike raids were dreaded by the emperors of the Eastern\nRoman Empire, who lived at Constantinople.  One emperor gave them\nland and money, and thus stopped their invasions for a time.",
        "The most famous of the Ostrogoth kings was Theodoric (The-od’-or-ic)\nthe Great.  He was the son of Theodemir (The-od’-e-mir), who was\nalso a king of the Ostrogoths.  When Theodoric was eight years old\nhe was sent to Constantinople to be held as a hostage by Leo, the\nEmperor of the East.  In former times, when kings made treaties\nwith one another, it was customary for one to give to the other a\npledge or security that he would fulfill the conditions of the treaty.\nThe pledge usually given was some important person or persons,\nperhaps the king’s son or a number of his chief men.  Persons so\ngiven as a security were called hostages.  When Theodoric was a boy\nhe was given as a hostage for his father’s good faith in carrying\nout a treaty with the Emperor and was sent to Constantinople to\nlive.  Here the youth was well treated by Leo.  He was educated\nwith great care and trained in all the exercises of war.",
        "Theodemir died in 475, and then Theodoric returned to his own country\nand became king of the Ostrogoths.  At this time he was eighteen\nyears of age.  He was handsome and brave and people loved him, for\nin those days a man who was tall and strong and brave was liked by\neverybody.",
        "For some years after he became king Theodoric had frequent wars with\nother Gothic kings and also with the Roman Emperor Zeno (Ze’-no).\nHe was nearly always successful in battle, and at last Zeno began\nto think it would be better to try to make friends with him.  So\nhe gave Theodoric some rich lands and made him commander of the\nImperial Guard of Constantinople.",
        "But the Emperor soon became tired of having the Ostrogoth king at\nhis court, and to get rid of him he agreed that Theodoric should\ngo with his army to Italy, and take that country from Odoacer\n(O-do-a’-cer).  Theodoric was delighted at the proposal and began\nat once to make his preparations.",
        "Odoacer was at that time king of Italy.  Before he became king he\nhad been a general in the army of Romulus Augustulus, the Western\nRoman Emperor.  The soldiers of the army were not satisfied with\ntheir pay, and when they asked for more they did not get it.  Then\nthey drove Romulus Augustulus from the throne, and chose Odoacer\nto succeed him.  But Odoacer would not take the name of emperor.\nHe was called the “patrician” of Italy, and he ruled the country\nwell.",
        "Theodoric started for Italy, not only with a great army, but with\nall the people of his country.  He meant to take Italy and be its\nking and settle in it with all his Ostrogoths.  When he set out he\nhad with him two hundred and fifty thousand persons—men, women,\nand children—with a great number of horses and wagons to carry\nthem and their things.  He had also an army of sixty thousand brave\nsoldiers.",
        "It was a long and weary journey from the shores of the Black Sea\noverland to the foot of the Alps Mountains and across the Alps\ninto Italy.  Here and there on the way they met savage tribes that\ntried to stop them, but Theodoric defeated the savages and took a\ngreat many of them prisoners.  He made these prisoners, women as\nwell as men, help carry the baggage and do other work.",
        "The journey took months, but at last the Ostrogoths reached the\ntop of the Alps.  Then they could see, stretched out before them,\nthe beautiful land of Italy.  They were all delighted.  They shouted\nand danced with joy, and Theodoric cried out:",
        "“There is the country which shall be our home.  Let us march on.\nIt certainly shall be ours.”",
        "Then they passed quickly down, and soon they were in Italy.  Odoacer\nhad heard of their coming and he got ready an army to drive them\naway.  Theodoric also got his fighting men ready.  The two armies\nmet, and there was a great battle near the town of Aquileia.  Odoacer\nwas defeated.  Then he tried to get Theodoric to leave Italy by\noffering him a large sum of money.",
        "“I will give you,” said he, “thousands of pounds of gold and silver\nif you agree to go back to your own country.”",
        "But Theodoric would not go.  He said he had as good a right to\nbe king of Italy as Odoacer, and he would remain and conquer the\ncountry and be its king.  Soon after there was another battle, near\nVerona, and Odoacer was again defeated.",
        "Theodoric came very near being killed in battle.  He was saved only\nby the courage of his mother.  She was in his camp, and at one time\nshe saw a number of the Ostrogoths running away from that part\nof the battle-field where her son was fighting, thus leaving him\nwithout support.  The mother rushed forward and stopped the fleeing\nmen.  She made them feel that it was a shame for them to desert\ntheir leader, and they at once returned to the field and fought\nbeside their king until the battle was won.",
        "After the battle of Verona, Odoacer went with his army to the city\nof Ravenna, and remained there for some time.  Theodoric followed\nwith his Ostrogoths and tried to take the city, but there was a\nvery strong wall around it, and the Ostrogoths could not capture\nit.  Although Theodoric was not able to take Ravenna, he did not\nremain idle.  He marched off to other parts of the country, and\ntook possession of towns and districts wherever he went.",
        "After a while Odoacer got together a better army than he had before,\nand made another effort to defeat Theodoric.  But he again failed.\nTheodoric defeated him in another great battle, which was fought\non the banks of the River Adda.  After this battle Odoacer again\nfled to Ravenna.  Theodoric followed again and laid siege to the\ncity.  This time his army surrounded it and kept provisions from\nbeing sent in, and at last, when there was no food in the city for\nthe soldiers or the people to eat, Odoacer had to surrender.",
        "A treaty was then made between the two kings and both agreed that\nthey should rule together over Italy, each to have equal power.\nBut a few days afterwards Theodoric murdered Odoacer while sitting\nat a banquet, and then made himself the sole king of Italy.  He\ndivided one-third of the land of the country among his own followers.\nSo the Ostrogoths settled in Italy, and Ostrogoths, Romans, and\nVisigoths were governed by Theodoric as one people.",
        "Theodoric died at the age of seventy-one after ruling Italy for\nthirty-three years.",
