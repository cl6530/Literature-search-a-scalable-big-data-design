        "THERE is one mind common to all individual men. Every\nman is an inlet to the same and to all of the same. He\nthat is once admitted to the right of reason is made a\nfreeman of the whole estate. What Plato has thought,\nhe may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what\nat any time has befallen any man, he can understand.\nWho hath access to this universal mind is a party to\nall that is or can be done, for this is the only and\nsovereign agent.",
        "Of the works of this mind history is the record. Its\ngenius is illustrated by the entire series of days.\nMan is explicable by nothing less than all his\nhistory. Without hurry, without rest, the human spirit\ngoes forth from the beginning to embody every faculty,\nevery thought, every emotion, which belongs to it, in\nappropriate events. But the thought is always prior to\nthe fact; all the facts of history preexist in the\nmind as laws. Each law in turn is made by circumstances\npredominant, and the limits of nature give power to but\none at a time. A man is the whole encyclopaedia of facts.\nThe creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn, and\nEgypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain, America, lie folded\nalready in the first man. Epoch after epoch, camp,\nkingdom, empire, republic, democracy, are merely the\napplication of his manifold spirit to the manifold world.",
        "This human mind wrote history, and this must read it.\nThe Sphinx must solve her own riddle. If the whole of\nhistory is in one man, it is all to be explained from\nindividual experience. There is a relation between the\nhours of our life and the centuries of time. As the\nair I breathe is drawn from the great repositories of\nnature, as the light on my book is yielded by a star a\nhundred millions of miles distant, as the poise of my\nbody depends on the equilibrium of centrifugal and\ncentripetal forces, so the hours should be instructed\nby the ages and the ages explained by the hours. Of\nthe universal mind each individual man is one more\nincarnation. All its properties consist in him. Each\nnew fact in his private experience flashes a light on\nwhat great bodies of men have done, and the crises of\nhis life refer to national crises. Every revolution\nwas first a thought in one man’s mind, and when the\nsame thought occurs to another man, it is the key to\nthat era. Every reform was once a private opinion, and\nwhen it shall be a private opinion again it will solve\nthe problem of the age. The fact narrated must correspond\nto something in me to be credible or intelligible. We, as\nwe read, must become Greeks, Romans, Turks, priest and\nking, martyr and executioner; must fasten these images\nto some reality in our secret experience, or we shall\nlearn nothing rightly. What befell Asdrubal or Caesar\nBorgia is as much an illustration of the mind’s powers\nand depravations as what has befallen us. Each new law\nand political movement has meaning for you. Stand before\neach of its tablets and say, ’Under this mask did my\nProteus nature hide itself.’ This remedies the defect\nof our too great nearness to ourselves. This throws our\nactions into perspective; and as crabs, goats, scorpions,\nthe balance and the waterpot lose their meanness when\nhung as signs in the zodiac, so I can see my own vices\nwithout heat in the distant persons of Solomon, Alcibiades,\nand Catiline.",
        "It is the universal nature which gives worth to\nparticular men and things. Human life, as containing\nthis, is mysterious and inviolable, and we hedge it\nround with penalties and laws. All laws derive hence\ntheir ultimate reason; all express more or less\ndistinctly some command of this supreme, illimitable\nessence. Property also holds of the soul, covers great\nspiritual facts, and instinctively we at first hold to\nit with swords and laws and wide and complex combinations.\nThe obscure consciousness of this fact is the light of\nall our day, the claim of claims; the plea for education,\nfor justice, for charity; the foundation of friendship\nand love and of the heroism and grandeur which belong to\nacts of self-reliance. It is remarkable that involuntarily\nwe always read as superior beings. Universal history, the\npoets, the romancers, do not in their stateliest pictures,\n—in the sacerdotal, the imperial palaces, in the triumphs\nof will or of genius,—anywhere lose our ear, anywhere make\nus feel that we intrude, that this is for better men; but\nrather is it true that in their grandest strokes we feel\nmost at home. All that Shakspeare says of the king, yonder\nslip of a boy that reads in the corner feels to be true of himself. We sympathize in the great moments of history, in\nthe great discoveries, the great resistances, the great\nprosperities of men;—because there law was enacted, the\nsea was searched, the land was found, or the blow was\nstruck, for us, as we ourselves in that place would have\ndone or applauded.",
        "We have the same interest in condition and character.\nWe honor the rich because they have externally the\nfreedom, power, and grace which we feel to be proper\nto man, proper to us. So all that is said of the wise\nman by Stoic or Oriental or modern essayist, describes\nto each reader his own idea, describes his unattained\nbut attainable self. All literature writes the character\nof the wise man. Books, monuments, pictures, conversation,\nare portraits in which he finds the lineaments he is\nforming. The silent and the eloquent praise him and accost\nhim, and he is stimulated wherever he moves, as by personal allusions.  A true aspirant therefore never needs look for\nallusions personal and laudatory in discourse. He hears the commendation, not of himself, but, more sweet, of that\ncharacter he seeks, in every word that is said concerning character, yea further in every fact and circumstance,—in\nthe running river and the rustling corn. Praise is looked,\nhomage tendered, love flows, from mute nature, from the\nmountains and the lights of the firmament.",
        "These hints, dropped as it were from sleep and night,\nlet us use in broad day. The student is to read\nhistory actively and not passively; to esteem his own\nlife the text, and books the commentary. Thus\ncompelled, the Muse of history will utter oracles, as\nnever to those who do not respect themselves. I have\nno expectation that any man will read history aright\nwho thinks that what was done in a remote age, by men\nwhose names have resounded far, has any deeper sense\nthan what he is doing to-day.",
        "The world exists for the education of each man. There\nis no age or state of society or mode of action in\nhistory to which there is not somewhat corresponding\nin his life. Every thing tends in a wonderful manner\nto abbreviate itself and yield its own virtue to him.\nHe should see that he can live all history in his own\nperson. He must sit solidly at home, and not suffer\nhimself to be bullied by kings or empires, but know\nthat he is greater than all the geography and all the\ngovernment of the world; he must transfer the point of\nview from which history is commonly read, from Rome\nand Athens and London, to himself, and not deny his\nconviction that he is the court, and if England or\nEgypt have any thing to say to him he will try the\ncase; if not, let them for ever be silent. He must\nattain and maintain that lofty sight where facts yield\ntheir secret sense, and poetry and annals are alike.\nThe instinct of the mind, the purpose of nature,\nbetrays itself in the use we make of the signal\nnarrations of history. Time dissipates to shining\nether the solid angularity of facts. No anchor, no\ncable, no fences avail to keep a fact a fact.\nBabylon, Troy, Tyre, Palestine, and even early Rome\nare passing already into fiction. The Garden of Eden,\nthe sun standing still in Gibeon, is poetry\nthenceforward to all nations. Who cares what the fact\nwas, when we have made a constellation of it to hang\nin heaven an immortal sign? London and Paris and New\nYork must go the same way. “What is history,” said\nNapoleon, “but a fable agreed upon?” This life of ours\nis stuck round with Egypt, Greece, Gaul, England, War,\nColonization, Church, Court and Commerce, as with so\nmany flowers and wild ornaments grave and gay. I will\nnot make more account of them. I believe in Eternity.\nI can find Greece, Asia, Italy, Spain and the Islands,\n—the genius and creative principle of each and of all\neras, in my own mind.",
        "We are always coming up with the emphatic facts of\nhistory in our private experience and verifying them\nhere. All history becomes subjective; in other words\nthere is properly no history, only biography. Every\nmind must know the whole lesson for itself,—must go\nover the whole ground. What it does not see, what it\ndoes not live, it will not know. What the former age\nhas epitomized into a formula or rule for manipular\nconvenience, it will lose all the good of verifying\nfor itself, by means of the wall of that rule.\nSomewhere, sometime, it will demand and find\ncompensation for that loss, by doing the work itself.\nFerguson discovered many things in astronomy which had\nlong been known. The better for him.",
        "History must be this or it is nothing. Every law which\nthe state enacts indicates a fact in human nature;\nthat is all. We must in ourselves see the necessary\nreason of every fact,—see how it could and must be.\nSo stand before every public and private work; before\nan oration of Burke, before a victory of Napoleon,\nbefore a martyrdom of Sir Thomas More, of Sidney, of\nMarmaduke Robinson; before a French Reign of Terror,\nand a Salem hanging of witches; before a fanatic\nRevival and the Animal Magnetism in Paris, or in\nProvidence. We assume that we under like influence\nshould be alike affected, and should achieve the like;\nand we aim to master intellectually the steps and\nreach the same height or the same degradation that\nour fellow, our proxy has done.",
        "All inquiry into antiquity, all curiosity respecting\nthe Pyramids, the excavated cities, Stonehenge, the\nOhio Circles, Mexico, Memphis,—is the desire to do\naway this wild, savage, and preposterous There or Then,\nand introduce in its place the Here and the Now. Belzoni\ndigs and measures in the mummy-pits and pyramids of\nThebes, until he can see the end of the difference between\nthe monstrous work and himself. When he has satisfied\nhimself, in general and in detail, that it was made by\nsuch a person as he, so armed and so motived, and to ends\nto which he himself should also have worked, the problem\nis solved; his thought lives along the whole line of\ntemples and sphinxes and catacombs, passes through\nthem all with satisfaction, and they live again to the\nmind, or are now.",
        "A Gothic cathedral affirms that it was done by us and\nnot done by us. Surely it was by man, but we find it\nnot in our man. But we apply ourselves to the history\nof its production. We put ourselves into the place and\nstate of the builder. We remember the forest-dwellers,\nthe first temples, the adherence to the first type,\nand the decoration of it as the wealth of the nation\nincreased; the value which is given to wood by carving\nled to the carving over the whole mountain of stone of\na cathedral. When we have gone through this process,\nand added thereto the Catholic Church, its cross, its\nmusic, its processions, its Saints’ days and image-\nworship, we have as it were been the man that made the\nminster; we have seen how it could and must be. We have\nthe sufficient reason.",
        "The difference between men is in their principle of\nassociation. Some men classify objects by color and\nsize and other accidents of appearance; others by\nintrinsic likeness, or by the relation of cause and\neffect. The progress of the intellect is to the\nclearer vision of causes, which neglects surface\ndifferences. To the poet, to the philosopher, to the\nsaint, all things are friendly and sacred, all events\nprofitable, all days holy, all men divine. For the eye\nis fastened on the life, and slights the circumstance.\nEvery chemical substance, every plant, every animal in\nits growth, teaches the unity of cause, the variety of\nappearance.",
        "Upborne and surrounded as we are by this all-creating\nnature, soft and fluid as a cloud or the air, why\nshould we be such hard pedants, and magnify a few\nforms? Why should we make account of time, or of\nmagnitude, or of figure? The soul knows them not, and\ngenius, obeying its law, knows how to play with them\nas a young child plays with graybeards and in\nchurches. Genius studies the causal thought, and far\nback in the womb of things sees the rays parting from\none orb, that diverge, ere they fall, by infinite\ndiameters. Genius watches the monad through all his\nmasks as he performs the metempsychosis of nature.\nGenius detects through the fly, through the\ncaterpillar, through the grub, through the egg, the\nconstant individual; through countless individuals\nthe fixed species; through many species the genus;\nthrough all genera the steadfast type; through all\nthe kingdoms of organized life the eternal unity.\nNature is a mutable cloud which is always and never\nthe same. She casts the same thought into troops of\nforms, as a poet makes twenty fables with one moral.\nThrough the bruteness and toughness of matter, a\nsubtle spirit bends all things to its own will. The\nadamant streams into soft but precise form before it,\nand whilst I look at it its outline and texture are\nchanged again. Nothing is so fleeting as form; yet\nnever does it quite deny itself. In man we still trace\nthe remains or hints of all that we esteem badges of\nservitude in the lower races; yet in him they enhance\nhis nobleness and grace; as Io, in Aeschylus,\ntransformed to a cow, offends the imagination; but how\nchanged when as Isis in Egypt she meets Osiris-Jove,\na beautiful woman with nothing of the metamorphosis\nleft but the lunar horns as the splendid ornament of\nher brows!",
        "The identity of history is equally intrinsic, the\ndiversity equally obvious. There is, at the surface,\ninfinite variety of things; at the centre there is\nsimplicity of cause. How many are the acts of one man\nin which we recognize the same character! Observe the\nsources of our information in respect to the Greek\ngenius. We have the civil history of that people, as\nHerodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, and Plutarch have\ngiven it; a very sufficient account of what manner of\npersons they were and what they did. We have the same\nnational mind expressed for us again in their\nliterature, in epic and lyric poems, drama, and\nphilosophy; a very complete form. Then we have it once\nmore in their architecture, a beauty as of temperance\nitself, limited to the straight line and the square,\n—a builded geometry. Then we have it once again in\nsculpture, the “tongue on the balance of expression,\"\na multitude of forms in the utmost freedom of action\nand never transgressing the ideal serenity; like\nvotaries performing some religious dance before the\ngods, and, though in convulsive pain or mortal combat,\nnever daring to break the figure and decorum of their\ndance. Thus of the genius of one remarkable people we\nhave a fourfold representation: and to the senses what\nmore unlike than an ode of Pindar, a marble centaur,\nthe peristyle of the Parthenon, and the last actions\nof Phocion?",
        "Every one must have observed faces and forms which,\nwithout any resembling feature, make a like impression\non the beholder. A particular picture or copy of\nverses, if it do not awaken the same train of images,\nwill yet superinduce the same sentiment as some wild\nmountain walk, although the resemblance is nowise\nobvious to the senses, but is occult and out of the\nreach of the understanding. Nature is an endless\ncombination and repetition of a very few laws. She\nhums the old well-known air through innumerable\nvariations.",
        "Nature is full of a sublime family likeness throughout\nher works, and delights in startling us with resemblances\nin the most unexpected quarters. I have seen the head of\nan old sachem of the forest which at once reminded the\neye of a bald mountain summit, and the furrows of the brow\nsuggested the strata of the rock. There are men whose\nmanners have the same essential splendor as the simple\nand awful sculpture on the friezes of the Parthenon and\nthe remains of the earliest Greek art. And there are\ncompositions of the same strain to be found in the books\nof all ages.  What is Guido’s Rospigliosi Aurora but a\nmorning thought, as the horses in it are only a morning\ncloud?  If any one will but take pains to observe the\nvariety of actions to which he is equally inclined in\ncertain moods of mind, and those to which he is averse,\nhe will see how deep is the chain of affinity.",
        "A painter told me that nobody could draw a tree\nwithout in some sort becoming a tree; or draw a child\nby studying the outlines of its form merely,—but,\nby watching for a time his motions and plays, the\npainter enters into his nature and can then draw him\nat will in every attitude. So Roos “entered into the\ninmost nature of a sheep.” I knew a draughtsman\nemployed in a public survey who found that he could\nnot sketch the rocks until their geological structure\nwas first explained to him. In a certain state of\nthought is the common origin of very diverse works. It\nis the spirit and not the fact that is identical. By a\ndeeper apprehension, and not primarily by a painful\nacquisition of many manual skills, the artist attains\nthe power of awakening other souls to a given activity.",
        "It has been said that “common souls pay with what they\ndo, nobler souls with that which they are.” And why?\nBecause a profound nature awakens in us by its actions\nand words, by its very looks and manners, the same power\nand beauty that a gallery of sculpture or of pictures\naddresses.",
        "Civil and natural history, the history of art and of\nliterature, must be explained from individual history,\nor must remain words. There is nothing but is related\nto us, nothing that does not interest us,—kingdom,\ncollege, tree, horse, or iron shoe,—the roots of all\nthings are in man. Santa Croce and the Dome of St.\nPeter’s are lame copies after a divine model. Strasburg\nCathedral is a material counterpart of the soul of Erwin\nof Steinbach. The true poem is the poet’s mind; the true\nship is the ship-builder. In the man, could we lay him\nopen, we should see the reason for the last flourish and\ntendril of his work; as every spine and tint in the\nsea-shell preexists in the secreting organs of the fish.\nThe whole of heraldry and of chivalry is in courtesy. A\nman of fine manners shall pronounce your name with all\nthe ornament that titles of nobility could ever add.",
        "The trivial experience of every day is always verifying\nsome old prediction to us and converting into things the\nwords and signs which we had heard and seen without heed.\nA lady with whom I was riding in the forest said to me\nthat the woods always seemed to her to wait, as if the\ngenii who inhabit them suspended their deeds until the\nwayfarer had passed onward; a thought which poetry has\ncelebrated in the dance of the fairies, which breaks off\non the approach of human feet. The man who has seen the\nrising moon break out of the clouds at midnight, has been\npresent like an archangel at the creation of light and of\nthe world. I remember one summer day in the fields my\ncompanion pointed out to me a broad cloud, which might\nextend a quarter of a mile parallel to the horizon, quite\naccurately in the form of a cherub as painted over churches,\n—a round block in the centre, which it was easy to animate\nwith eyes and mouth, supported on either side by wide-\nstretched symmetrical wings.  What appears once in the\natmosphere may appear often, and it was undoubtedly the\narchetype of that familiar ornament. I have seen in the\nsky a chain of summer lightning which at once showed to\nme that the Greeks drew from nature when they painted the\nthunderbolt in the hand of Jove. I have seen a snow-drift\nalong the sides of the stone wall which obviously gave the\nidea of the common architectural scroll to abut a tower.",
        "By surrounding ourselves with the original circumstances\nwe invent anew the orders and the ornaments of architecture,\nas we see how each people merely decorated its primitive\nabodes. The Doric temple preserves the semblance of the\nwooden cabin in which the Dorian dwelt. The Chinese pagoda\nis plainly a Tartar tent. The Indian and Egyptian temples\nstill betray the mounds and subterranean houses of their\nforefathers. “The custom of making houses and tombs in\nthe living rock,” says Heeren in his Researches on the\nEthiopians, “determined very naturally the principal\ncharacter of the Nubian Egyptian architecture to the\ncolossal form which it assumed. In these caverns, already\nprepared by nature, the eye was accustomed to dwell on\nhuge shapes and masses, so that when art came to the\nassistance of nature it could not move on a small scale\nwithout degrading itself. What would statues of the usual\nsize, or neat porches and wings have been, associated with\nthose gigantic halls before which only Colossi could sit\nas watchmen or lean on the pillars of the interior?”",
        "The Gothic church plainly originated in a rude adaptation\nof the forest trees, with all their boughs, to a festal\nor solemn arcade; as the bands about the cleft pillars\nstill indicate the green withes that tied them. No one\ncan walk in a road cut through pine woods, without being\nstruck with the architectural appearance of the grove,\nespecially in winter, when the barrenness of all other\ntrees shows the low arch of the Saxons. In the woods in\na winter afternoon one will see as readily the origin of\nthe stained glass window, with which the Gothic cathedrals\nare adorned, in the colors of the western sky seen through\nthe bare and crossing branches of the forest. Nor can any\nlover of nature enter the old piles of Oxford and the\nEnglish cathedrals, without feeling that the forest\noverpowered the mind of the builder, and that his chisel,\nhis saw and plane still reproduced its ferns, its spikes\nof flowers, its locust, elm, oak, pine, fir and spruce.",
        "The Gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone subdued\nby the insatiable demand of harmony in man. The\nmountain of granite blooms into an eternal flower,\nwith the lightness and delicate finish as well as the\naerial proportions and perspective of vegetable beauty.",
        "In like manner all public facts are to be individualized,\nall private facts are to be generalized. Then at once\nHistory becomes fluid and true, and Biography deep and\nsublime. As the Persian imitated in the slender shafts\nand capitals of his architecture the stem and flower of\nthe lotus and palm, so the Persian court in its magnificent\nera never gave over the nomadism of its barbarous tribes,\nbut travelled from Ecbatana, where the spring was spent,\nto Susa in summer and to Babylon for the winter.",
        "In the early history of Asia and Africa, Nomadism and\nAgriculture are the two antagonist facts. The geography\nof Asia and of Africa necessitated a nomadic life. But\nthe nomads were the terror of all those whom the soil\nor the advantages of a market had induced to build towns.\nAgriculture therefore was a religious injunction, because\nof the perils of the state from nomadism. And in these\nlate and civil countries of England and America these\npropensities still fight out the old battle, in the nation\nand in the individual. The nomads of Africa were constrained\nto wander, by the attacks of the gad-fly, which drives the\ncattle mad, and so compels the tribe to emigrate in the\nrainy season and to drive off the cattle to the higher sandy\nregions. The nomads of Asia follow the pasturage from month\nto month. In America and Europe the nomadism is of trade and\ncuriosity; a progress, certainly, from the gad-fly of\nAstaboras to the Anglo and Italo-mania of Boston Bay. Sacred\ncities, to which a periodical religious pilgrimage was\nenjoined, or stringent laws and customs, tending to invigorate\nthe national bond, were the check on the old rovers; and the\ncumulative values of long residence are the restraints on the\nitineracy of the present day. The antagonism of the two\ntendencies is not less active in individuals, as the love of\nadventure or the love of repose happens to predominate. A man\nof rude health and flowing spirits has the faculty of rapid\ndomestication, lives in his wagon and roams through all\nlatitudes as easily as a Calmuc. At sea, or in the forest, or\nin the snow, he sleeps as warm, dines with as good appetite,\nand associates as happily as beside his own chimneys. Or\nperhaps his facility is deeper seated, in the increased range\nof his faculties of observation, which yield him points of\ninterest wherever fresh objects meet his eyes. The pastoral\nnations were needy and hungry to desperation; and this\nintellectual nomadism, in its excess, bankrupts the mind\nthrough the dissipation of power on a miscellany of objects.\nThe home-keeping wit, on the other hand, is that continence\nor content which finds all the elements of life in its own\nsoil; and which has its own perils of monotony and\ndeterioration, if not stimulated by foreign infusions.",
        "Every thing the individual sees without him corresponds to\nhis states of mind, and every thing is in turn intelligible\nto him, as his onward thinking leads him into the truth to\nwhich that fact or series belongs.",
        "The primeval world,—the Fore-World, as the Germans say,\n—I can dive to it in myself as well as grope for it with\nresearching fingers in catacombs, libraries, and the broken\nreliefs and torsos of ruined villas.",
        "What is the foundation of that interest all men feel in\nGreek history, letters, art, and poetry, in all its periods\nfrom the Heroic or Homeric age down to the domestic life of\nthe Athenians and Spartans, four or five centuries later?\nWhat but this, that every man passes personally through a\nGrecian period. The Grecian state is the era of the bodily\nnature, the perfection of the senses,—of the spiritual\nnature unfolded in strict unity with the body. In it existed\nthose human forms which supplied the sculptor with his\nmodels of Hercules, Phoebus, and Jove; not like the forms\nabounding in the streets of modern cities, wherein the face\nis a confused blur of features, but composed of incorrupt,\nsharply defined and symmetrical features, whose eye-sockets\nare so formed that it would be impossible for such eyes to\nsquint and take furtive glances on this side and on that, but\nthey must turn the whole head. The manners of that period are\nplain and fierce. The reverence exhibited is for personal\nqualities; courage, address, self-command, justice, strength,\nswiftness, a loud voice, a broad chest. Luxury and elegance\nare not known. A sparse population and want make every man his\nown valet, cook, butcher and soldier, and the habit of supplying\nhis own needs educates the body to wonderful performances. Such\nare the Agamemnon and Diomed of Homer, and not far different is\nthe picture Xenophon gives of himself and his compatriots in the\nRetreat of the Ten Thousand. “After the army had crossed the\nriver Teleboas in Armenia, there fell much snow, and the troops\nlay miserably on the ground covered with it. But Xenophon arose\nnaked, and taking an axe, began to split wood; whereupon others\nrose and did the like.” Throughout his army exists a boundless\nliberty of speech. They quarrel for plunder, they wrangle with\nthe generals on each new order, and Xenophon is as sharp-tongued\nas any and sharper-tongued than most, and so gives as good as he\ngets. Who does not see that this is a gang of great boys, with\nsuch a code of honor and such lax discipline as great boys have?",
        "The costly charm of the ancient tragedy, and indeed of all the\nold literature, is that the persons speak simply,—speak as\npersons who have great good sense without knowing it, before\nyet the reflective habit has become the predominant habit of\nthe mind. Our admiration of the antique is not admiration of\nthe old, but of the natural. The Greeks are not reflective, but\nperfect in their senses and in their health, with the finest\nphysical organization in the world. Adults acted with the\nsimplicity and grace of children. They made vases, tragedies,\nand statues, such as healthy senses should,—that is, in good\ntaste. Such things have continued to be made in all ages, and\nare now, wherever a healthy physique exists; but, as a class,\nfrom their superior organization, they have surpassed all. They\ncombine the energy of manhood with the engaging unconsciousness\nof childhood. The attraction of these manners is that they\nbelong to man, and are known to every man in virtue of his\nbeing once a child; besides that there are always individuals\nwho retain these characteristics. A person of childlike genius\nand inborn energy is still a Greek, and revives our love of the\nMuse of Hellas. I admire the love of nature in the Philoctetes.\nIn reading those fine apostrophes to sleep, to the stars, rocks,\nmountains and waves, I feel time passing away as an ebbing sea.\nI feel the eternity of man, the identity of his thought. The\nGreek had it seems the same fellow-beings as I. The sun and moon,\nwater and fire, met his heart precisely as they meet mine. Then\nthe vaunted distinction between Greek and English, between Classic\nand Romantic schools, seems superficial and pedantic. When a\nthought of Plato becomes a thought to me,—when a truth that\nfired the soul of Pindar fires mine, time is no more. When I\nfeel that we two meet in a perception, that our two souls are\ntinged with the same hue, and do as it were run into one, why\nshould I measure degrees of latitude, why should I count\nEgyptian years?",
        "The student interprets the age of chivalry by his own\nage of chivalry, and the days of maritime adventure\nand circumnavigation by quite parallel miniature\nexperiences of his own. To the sacred history of the\nworld he has the same key. When the voice of a prophet\nout of the deeps of antiquity merely echoes to him a\nsentiment of his infancy, a prayer of his youth, he then\npierces to the truth through all the confusion of\ntradition and the caricature of institutions.",
        "Rare, extravagant spirits come by us at intervals, who\ndisclose to us new facts in nature. I see that men of\nGod have from time to time walked among men and made\ntheir commission felt in the heart and soul of the\ncommonest hearer. Hence evidently the tripod, the\npriest, the priestess inspired by the divine afflatus.",
        "Jesus astonishes and overpowers sensual people. They\ncannot unite him to history, or reconcile him with\nthemselves. As they come to revere their intuitions\nand aspire to live holily, their own piety explains\nevery fact, every word.",
        "How easily these old worships of Moses, of Zoroaster,\nof Menu, of Socrates, domesticate themselves in the\nmind. I cannot find any antiquity in them. They are\nmine as much as theirs.",
        "I have seen the first monks and anchorets, without\ncrossing seas or centuries.

        "The priestcraft of the East and West, of the Magian,\nBrahmin, Druid, and Inca, is expounded in the individual’s\nprivate life. The cramping influence of a hard formalist\non a young child, in repressing his spirits and courage,\nparalyzing the understanding, and that without producing\nindignation, but only fear and obedience, and even much\nsympathy with the tyranny,—is a familiar fact, explained\nto the child when he becomes a man, only by seeing that\nthe oppressor of his youth is himself a child tyrannized\nover by those names and words and forms of whose influence\nhe was merely the organ to the youth. The fact teaches him\nhow Belus was worshipped and how the Pyramids were built,\nbetter than the discovery by Champollion of the names of\nall the workmen and the cost of every tile.  He finds\nAssyria and the Mounds of Cholula at his door, and himself\nhas laid the courses.",
        "Again, in that protest which each considerate person\nmakes against the superstition of his times, he\nrepeats step for step the part of old reformers, and\nin the search after truth finds, like them, new perils\nto virtue. He learns again what moral vigor is needed\nto supply the girdle of a superstition. A great\nlicentiousness treads on the heels of a reformation.\nHow many times in the history of the world has the\nLuther of the day had to lament the decay of piety in\nhis own household! “Doctor,” said his wife to Martin\nLuther, one day, “how is it that whilst subject to\npapacy we prayed so often and with such fervor, whilst\nnow we pray with the utmost coldness and very seldom?”",
        "The advancing man discovers how deep a property he has\nin literature,—in all fable as well as in all history.\nHe finds that the poet was no odd fellow who described\nstrange and impossible situations, but that universal\nman wrote by his pen a confession true for one and true\nfor all. His own secret biography he finds in lines\nwonderfully intelligible to him, dotted down before he\nwas born. One after another he comes up in his private\nadventures with every fable of Aesop, of Homer, of Hafiz,\nof Ariosto, of Chaucer, of Scott, and verifies them with\nhis own head and hands.",
        "The beautiful fables of the Greeks, being proper\ncreations of the imagination and not of the fancy, are\nuniversal verities. What a range of meanings and what\nperpetual pertinence has the story of Prometheus!\nBeside its primary value as the first chapter of the\nhistory of Europe, (the mythology thinly veiling\nauthentic facts, the invention of the mechanic arts\nand the migration of colonies,) it gives the history\nof religion, with some closeness to the faith of later\nages. Prometheus is the Jesus of the old mythology. He\nis the friend of man; stands between the unjust “justice\"\nof the Eternal Father and the race of mortals, and readily\nsuffers all things on their account. But where it departs\nfrom the Calvinistic Christianity and exhibits him as the\ndefier of Jove, it represents a state of mind which readily\nappears wherever the doctrine of Theism is taught in a\ncrude, objective form, and which seems the self-defence\nof man against this untruth, namely a discontent with\nthe believed fact that a God exists, and a feeling\nthat the obligation of reverence is onerous. It would\nsteal if it could the fire of the Creator, and live\napart from him and independent of him. The Prometheus\nVinctus is the romance of skepticism. Not less true to\nall time are the details of that stately apologue.\nApollo kept the flocks of Admetus, said the poets.\nWhen the gods come among men, they are not known.\nJesus was not; Socrates and Shakspeare were not.\nAntaeus was suffocated by the gripe of Hercules, but\nevery time he touched his mother earth his strength\nwas renewed. Man is the broken giant, and in all his\nweakness both his body and his mind are invigorated\nby habits of conversation with nature. The power of\nmusic, the power of poetry, to unfix and as it were\nclap wings to solid nature, interprets the riddle of\nOrpheus. The philosophical perception of identity\nthrough endless mutations of form makes him know the\nProteus. What else am I who laughed or wept yesterday,\nwho slept last night like a corpse, and this morning\nstood and ran? And what see I on any side but the\ntransmigrations of Proteus? I can symbolize my thought\nby using the name of any creature, of any fact, because\nevery creature is man agent or patient.  Tantalus is\nbut a name for you and me. Tantalus means the\nimpossibility of drinking the waters of thought which\nare always gleaming and waving within sight of the soul.\nThe transmigration of souls is no fable. I would it were;\nbut men and women are only half human.  Every animal of\nthe barn-yard, the field and the forest, of the earth\nand of the waters that are under the earth, has contrived\nto get a footing and to leave the print of its features\nand form in some one or other of these upright, heaven-\nfacing speakers. Ah! brother, stop the ebb of thy soul,\n—ebbing downward into the forms into whose habits thou\nhast now for many years slid. As near and proper to us\nis also that old fable of the Sphinx, who was said to\nsit in the road-side and put riddles to every passenger.\nIf the man could not answer, she swallowed him alive. If\nhe could solve the riddle, the Sphinx was slain. What is\nour life but an endless flight of winged facts or events?\nIn splendid variety these changes come, all putting\nquestions to the human spirit. Those men who cannot answer\nby a superior wisdom these facts or questions of time,\nserve them. Facts encumber them, tyrannize over them, and\nmake the men of routine, the men of sense, in whom a\nliteral obedience to facts has extinguished every spark\nof that light by which man is truly man. But if the man\nis true to his better instincts or sentiments, and refuses\nthe dominion of facts, as one that comes of a higher race;\nremains fast by the soul and sees the principle, then the\nfacts fall aptly and supple into their places; they know\ntheir master, and the meanest of them glorifies him.",
        "See in Goethe’s Helena the same desire that every word\nshould be a thing. These figures, he would say, these\nChirons, Griffins, Phorkyas, Helen and Leda, are\nsomewhat, and do exert a specific influence on the\nmind. So far then are they eternal entities, as real\nto-day as in the first Olympiad. Much revolving them\nhe writes out freely his humor, and gives them body\nto his own imagination. And although that poem be as\nvague and fantastic as a dream, yet is it much more\nattractive than the more regular dramatic pieces of\nthe same author, for the reason that it operates a\nwonderful relief to the mind from the routine of\ncustomary images,—awakens the reader’s invention\nand fancy by the wild freedom of the design, and by\nthe unceasing succession of brisk shocks of surprise.",
        "The universal nature, too strong for the petty nature\nof the bard, sits on his neck and writes through his\nhand; so that when he seems to vent a mere caprice and\nwild romance, the issue is an exact allegory. Hence\nPlato said that “poets utter great and wise things\nwhich they do not themselves understand.” All the\nfictions of the Middle Age explain themselves as a\nmasked or frolic expression of that which in grave\nearnest the mind of that period toiled to achieve.\nMagic and all that is ascribed to it is a deep\npresentiment of the powers of science. The shoes of\nswiftness, the sword of sharpness, the power of\nsubduing the elements, of using the secret virtues of\nminerals, of understanding the voices of birds, are\nthe obscure efforts of the mind in a right direction.\nThe preternatural prowess of the hero, the gift of\nperpetual youth, and the like, are alike the endeavour\nof the human spirit “to bend the shows of things to\nthe desires of the mind.”",

        "Is it otherwise in the newest romance? I read the\nBride of Lammermoor. Sir William Ashton is a mask for\na vulgar temptation, Ravenswood Castle a fine name for\nproud poverty, and the foreign mission of state only a\nBunyan disguise for honest industry. We may all shoot\na wild bull that would toss the good and beautiful, by\nfighting down the unjust and sensual. Lucy Ashton is\nanother name for fidelity, which is always beautiful\nand always liable to calamity in this world.",
        "But along with the civil and metaphysical history of\nman, another history goes daily forward,—that of\nthe external world,—in which he is not less strictly\nimplicated. He is the compend of time; he is also the\ncorrelative of nature. His power consists in the\nmultitude of his affinities, in the fact that his life\nis intertwined with the whole chain of organic and\ninorganic being. In old Rome the public roads\nbeginning at the Forum proceeded north, south, east,\nwest, to the centre of every province of the empire,\nmaking each market-town of Persia, Spain and Britain\npervious to the soldiers of the capital: so out of the\nhuman heart go as it were highways to the heart of\nevery object in nature, to reduce it under the\ndominion of man. A man is a bundle of relations, a\nknot of roots, whose flower and fruitage is the world.\nHis faculties refer to natures out of him and predict\nthe world he is to inhabit, as the fins of the fish\nforeshow that water exists, or the wings of an eagle\nin the egg presuppose air. He cannot live without a\nworld. Put Napoleon in an island prison, let his\nfaculties find no men to act on, no Alps to climb, no\nstake to play for, and he would beat the air, and\nappear stupid. Transport him to large countries, dense\npopulation, complex interests and antagonist power,\nand you shall see that the man Napoleon, bounded that\nis by such a profile and outline, is not the virtual\nNapoleon.

One may say a gravitating solar system\nis already prophesied in the nature of Newton’s mind.\nNot less does the brain of Davy or of Gay-Lussac, from\nchildhood exploring the affinities and repulsions of\nparticles, anticipate the laws of organization. Does not\nthe eye of the human embryo predict the light? the ear of\nHandel predict the witchcraft of harmonic sound? Do not\nthe constructive fingers of Watt, Fulton, Whittemore,\nArkwright, predict the fusible, hard, and temperable\ntexture of metals, the properties of stone, water, and\nwood? Do not the lovely attributes of the maiden child\npredict the refinements and decorations of civil society?\nHere also we are reminded of the action of man on man. A\nmind might ponder its thought for ages and not gain so\nmuch self-knowledge as the passion of love shall teach it\nin a day. Who knows himself before he has been thrilled\nwith indignation at an outrage, or has heard an eloquent\ntongue, or has shared the throb of thousands in a national\nexultation or alarm?

        "I will not now go behind the general statement to explore\nthe reason of this correspondency. Let it suffice that in\nthe light of these two facts, namely, that the mind is One,\nand that nature is its correlative, history is to be read\nand written.",

You shall not tell me by languages and titles a\ncatalogue of the volumes you have read. You shall make me\nfeel what periods you have lived. A man shall be the Temple\nof Fame. He shall walk, as the poets have described that\ngoddess, in a robe painted all over with wonderful events\nand experiences;—his own form and features by their\nexalted intelligence shall be that variegated vest. I\nshall find in him the Foreworld; in his childhood the Age\nof Gold, the Apples of Knowledge, the Argonautic Expedition,\nthe calling of Abraham, the building of the Temple, the\nAdvent of Christ, Dark Ages, the Revival of Letters, the\nReformation, the discovery of new lands, the opening of new\nsciences and new regions in man.

        "Is there somewhat overweening in this claim? Then I reject\nall I have written, for what is the use of pretending to\nknow what we know not? But it is the fault of our rhetoric\nthat we cannot strongly state one fact without seeming to\nbelie some other. I hold our actual knowledge very cheap.\nHear the rats in the wall, see the lizard on the fence, the\nfungus under foot, the lichen on the log. What do I know\nsympathetically, morally, of either of these worlds of life?\nAs old as the Caucasian man,—perhaps older,—these creatures\nhave kept their counsel beside him, and there is no record of\nany word or sign that has passed from one to the other. What\nconnection do the books show between the fifty or sixty\nchemical elements and the historical eras? Nay, what does\nhistory yet record of the metaphysical annals of man?  What\nlight does it shed on those mysteries which we hide under the\nnames Death and Immortality? Yet every history should be\nwritten in a wisdom which divined the range of our affinities\nand looked at facts as symbols. I am ashamed to see what a\nshallow village tale our so-called History is. How many times\nwe must say Rome, and Paris, and Constantinople! What does\nRome know of rat and lizard? What are Olympiads and Consulates\nto these neighboring systems of being?  Nay, what food or\nexperience or succor have they for the Esquimaux seal-hunter,\nfor the Kanaka in his canoe, for the fisherman, the stevedore,\nthe porter?",
        "Broader and deeper we must write our annals,—from an ethical\nreformation, from an influx of the ever new, ever sanative\nconscience,—if we would trulier express our central and wide-\nrelated nature, instead of this old chronology of selfishness\nand pride to which we have too long lent our eyes. Already that\nday exists for us, shines in on us at unawares, but the path of\nscience and of letters is not the way into nature. The idiot,\nthe Indian, the child and unschooled farmer’s boy stand nearer\nto the light by which nature is to be read, than the dissector\nor the antiquary.",

        "I READ the other day some verses written by an eminent\npainter which were original and not conventional.  The\nsoul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the\nsubject be what it may. The sentiment they instil is of\nmore value than any thought they may contain. To believe\nyour own thought, to believe that what is true for you\nin your private heart is true for all men,—that is genius.\nSpeak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal\nsense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost, and\nour first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets\nof the Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind\nis to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato\nand Milton is that they set at naught books and traditions,\nand spoke not what men, but what they thought. A man should\nlearn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes\nacross his mind from within, more than the lustre of the\nfirmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without\nnotice his thought, because it is his. In every work of\ngenius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come\nback to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works\nof art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They\nteach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-\nhumored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices\nis on the other side. Else to-morrow a stranger will say\nwith masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and\nfelt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame\nour own opinion from another.",
        "There is a time in every man’s education when he arrives at\nthe conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is\nsuicide; that he must take himself for better for worse as\nhis portion; that though the wide universe is full of good,\nno kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his\ntoil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to\ntill. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and\nnone but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he\nknow until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character,\none fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This\nsculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony.\nThe eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might\ntestify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves,\nand are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents.\nIt may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues,\nso it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work\nmade manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has\nput his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has\nsaid or done otherwise shall give him no peace. It is a\ndeliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius\ndeserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope.",
        "Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept\nthe place the divine providence has found for you, the society\nof your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men\nhave always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the\ngenius of their age, betraying their perception that the\nabsolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working\nthrough their hands, predominating in all their being. And\nwe are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same\ntranscendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected\ncorner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides,\nredeemers and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort and\nadvancing on Chaos and the Dark.",
        "What pretty oracles nature yields us on this text in the\nface and behavior of children, babes, and even brutes! That\ndivided and rebel mind, that distrust of a sentiment because\nour arithmetic has computed the strength and means opposed to\nour purpose, these have not. Their mind being whole, their\neye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in their faces we\nare disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody; all conform to\nit; so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the\nadults who prattle and play to it.  So God has armed youth and\npuberty and manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm,\nand made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put\nby, if it will stand by itself. Do not think the youth has no\nforce, because he cannot speak to you and me. Hark! in the next\nroom his voice is sufficiently clear and emphatic. It seems he\nknows how to speak to his contemporaries. Bashful or bold then,\nhe will know how to make us seniors very unnecessary.",
        "The nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would\ndisdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate\none, is the healthy attitude of human nature. A boy is in\nthe parlor what the pit is in the playhouse; independent,\nirresponsible, looking out from his corner on such people\nand facts as pass by, he tries and sentences them on their\nmerits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad,\ninteresting, silly, eloquent, troublesome. He cumbers himself\nnever about consequences, about interests; he gives an\nindependent, genuine verdict. You must court him; he does\nnot court you. But the man is as it were clapped into jail\nby his consciousness. As soon as he has once acted or spoken\nwith eclat he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy\nor the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter\ninto his account. There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he\ncould pass again into his neutrality! Who can thus avoid all\npledges and, having observed, observe again from the same\nunaffected, unbiased, unbribable, unaffrighted innocence,—\nmust always be formidable. He would utter opinions on all\npassing affairs, which being seen to be not private but\nnecessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men and\nput them in fear.",
        "These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they\ngrow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world.

Society is a joint-stock company, in which the\nmembers agree, for the better securing of his bread to each\nshareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater.\nThe virtue in most request is conformity.  Self-reliance is its\naversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and\ncustoms.",
        "Whoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist. He who would\ngather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of\ngoodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at\nlast sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you\nto yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world. I\nremember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to\nmake to a valued adviser who was wont to importune me with the\ndear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, “What have I\nto do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from\nwithin?” my friend suggested,—\"But these impulses may be from\nbelow, not from above.” I replied, “They do not seem to me to\nbe such; but if I am the Devil’s child, I will live then from\nthe Devil.” No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature.\nGood and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or\nthis; the only right is what is after my constitution; the only\nwrong what is against it. A man is to carry himself in the\npresence of all opposition as if every thing were titular and\nephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate\nto badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions.\nEvery decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me\nmore than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak\nthe rude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat\nof philanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot assumes this\nbountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news\nfrom Barbadoes, why should I not say to him, ’Go love thy infant;\nlove thy wood-chopper; be good-natured and modest; have that\ngrace; and never varnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with\nthis incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off.\nThy love afar is spite at home.’ Rough and graceless would be\nsuch greeting, but truth is handsomer than the affectation of\nlove. Your goodness must have some edge to it,—else it is none.\nThe doctrine of hatred must be preached, as the counteraction\nof the doctrine of love, when that pules and whines. I shun\nfather and mother and wife and brother when my genius calls\nme. I would write on the lintels of the door-post, *Whim*. I\nhope it is somewhat better than whim at last, but we cannot\nspend the day in explanation. Expect me not to show cause why\nI seek or why I exclude company. Then again, do not tell me,\nas a good man did to-day, of my obligation to put all poor men\nin good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee thou foolish\nphilanthropist that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent, I\ngive to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not\nbelong. There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual\naffinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go to prison\nif need be; but your miscellaneous popular charities; the\neducation at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses\nto the vain end to which many now stand; alms to sots, and the\nthousand-fold Relief Societies;—though I confess with shame I\nsometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar\nwhich by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold.",
        "Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception\nthan the rule. There is the man and his virtues.  Men do\nwhat is called a good action, as some piece of courage or\ncharity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of\ndaily non-appearance on parade. Their works are done as an\napology or extenuation of their living in the world,—as\ninvalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are\npenances. I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is\nfor itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it\nshould be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than\nthat it should be glittering and unsteady. I wish it to be\nsound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. I ask\nprimary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal\nfrom the man to his actions. I know that for myself it makes\nno difference whether I do or forbear those actions which\nare reckoned excellent. I cannot consent to pay for a privilege\nwhere I have intrinsic right. Few and mean as my gifts may be,\nI actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the\nassurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.",
        "What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people\nthink. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual\nlife, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness\nand meanness. It is the harder because you will always find\nthose who think they know what is your duty better than you\nknow it. It is easy in the world to live after the world’s\nopinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but\nthe great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with\nperfect sweetness the independence of solitude.",
        "The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead\nto you is that it scatters your force. It loses your time and\nblurs the impression of your character. If you maintain a dead\nchurch, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great\nparty either for the government or against it, spread your\ntable like base housekeepers,—under all these screens I have\ndifficulty to detect the precise man you are:  and of course\nso much force is withdrawn from your proper life. But do your\nwork, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce\nyourself. A man must consider what a blindman’s-buff is this\ngame of conformity. If I know your sect, I anticipate your\nargument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the\nexpediency of one of the institutions of his church. Do I not\nknow beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous\nword? Do I not know that with all this ostentation of examining\nthe grounds of the institution he will do no such thing? Do I\nnot know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one\nside, the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister?\nHe is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the\nemptiest affectation. Well, most men have bound their eyes with\none or another handkerchief, and attached themselves to some\none of these communities of opinion.  This conformity makes\nthem not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies,\nbut false in all particulars. Their every truth is not quite\ntrue. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real\nfour; so that every word they say chagrins us and we know not\nwhere to begin to set them right. Meantime nature is not slow\nto equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we\nadhere. We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire\nby degrees the gentlest asinine expression. There is a mortifying\nexperience in particular, which does not fail to wreak itself\nalso in the general history; I mean “the foolish face of praise,\"\nthe forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel\nat ease in answer to conversation which does not interest us.\nThe muscles, not spontaneously moved but moved by a low\nusurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face\nwith the most disagreeable sensation.",
        "For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure.\nAnd therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face.\nThe by-standers look askance on him in the public street or\nin the friend’s parlor.  If this aversation had its origin\nin contempt and resistance like his own he might well go home\nwith a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the multitude,\nlike their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on\nand off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs. Yet is the\ndiscontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the\nsenate and the college. It is easy enough for a firm man who\nknows the world to brook the rage of the cultivated classes.\nTheir rage is decorous and prudent, for they are timid, as\nbeing very vulnerable themselves. But when to their feminine\nrage the indignation of the people is added, when the ignorant\nand the poor are aroused, when the unintelligent brute force\nthat lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and mow,\nit needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it\ngodlike as a trifle of no concernment.",

Why\ndrag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict\nsomewhat you have stated in this or that public place?\nSuppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems\nto be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone,\nscarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past\nfor judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever\nin a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality\nto the Deity, yet when the devout motions of the soul come,\nyield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God\nwith shape and color.

Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates,\nand Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and\nNewton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.\nTo be great is to be misunderstood.",
        "I suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies\nof his will are rounded in by the law of his being, as the\ninequalities of Andes and Himmaleh are insignificant in the\ncurve of the sphere. Nor does it matter how you gauge and\ntry him. A character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian\nstanza;—read it forward, backward, or across, it still\nspells the same thing. In this pleasing contrite wood-life\nwhich God allows me, let me record day by day my honest\nthought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt,\nit will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not and see\nit not. My book should smell of pines and resound with the\nhum of insects. The swallow over my window should interweave\nthat thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also.\nWe pass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills.\nMen imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only\nby overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a\nbreath every moment.",
        "There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions,\nso they be each honest and natural in their hour. For of\none will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike\nthey seem. These varieties are lost sight of at a little\ndistance, at a little height of thought. One tendency\nunites them all. The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag\nline of a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient\ndistance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency.\nYour genuine action will explain itself and will explain\nyour other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing.\nAct singly, and what you have already done singly will justify\nyou now. Greatness appeals to the future. If I can be firm\nenough to-day to do right and scorn eyes, I must have done\nso much right before as to defend me now. Be it how it will,\ndo right now. Always scorn appearances and you always may.\nThe force of character is cumulative. All the foregone days\nof virtue work their health into this. What makes the majesty\nof the heroes of the senate and the field, which so fills the\nimagination? The consciousness of a train of great days and\nvictories behind. They shed an united light on the advancing\nactor. He is attended as by a visible escort of angels. That\nis it which throws thunder into Chatham’s voice, and dignity\ninto Washington’s port, and America into Adams’s eye.  Honor\nis venerable to us because it is no ephemera. It is always\nancient virtue. We worship it to-day because it is not of\nto-day. We love it and pay it homage because it is not a\ntrap for our love and homage, but is self-dependent, self-\nderived, and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree, even\nif shown in a young person.",
        "I hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity\nand consistency. Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous\nhenceforward. Instead of the gong for dinner, let us hear\na whistle from the Spartan fife.  Let us never bow and\napologize more. A great man is coming to eat at my house.\nI do not wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to\nplease me. I will stand here for humanity, and though I\nwould make it kind, I would make it true. Let us affront\nand reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment\nof the times, and hurl in the face of custom and trade and\noffice, the fact which is the upshot of all history, that\nthere is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working\nwherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other\ntime or place, but is the centre of things. Where he is,\nthere is nature. He measures you and all men and all events.\nOrdinarily, every body in society reminds us of somewhat\nelse, or of some other person. Character, reality, reminds\nyou of nothing else; it takes place of the whole creation.\nThe man must be so much that he must make all circumstances\nindifferent. Every true man is a cause, a country, and an\nage; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to\naccomplish his design;—and posterity seem to follow his\nsteps as a train of clients. A man Caesar is born, and for\nages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and\nmillions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius that\nhe is confounded with virtue and the possible of man. An\ninstitution is the lengthened shadow of one man; as,\nMonachism, of the Hermit Antony; the Reformation, of Luther;\nQuakerism, of Fox; Methodism, of Wesley; Abolition, of Clarkson.\nScipio, Milton called “the height of Rome\"; and all history\nResolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout\nand earnest persons.",

But the man in the street,\nfinding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force\nwhich built a tower or sculptured a marble god, feels poor\nwhen he looks on these. To him a palace, a statue, or a\ncostly book have an alien and forbidding air, much like a\ngay equipage, and seem to say like that, ’Who are you, Sir?’\nYet they all are his, suitors for his notice, petitioners\nto his faculties that they will come out and take possession.\nThe picture waits for my verdict; it is not to command me,\nbut I am to settle its claims to praise. That popular fable\nof the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street,\ncarried to the duke’s house, washed and dressed and laid in\nthe duke’s bed, and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious\nceremony like the duke, and assured that he had been insane,\nowes its popularity to the fact that it symbolizes so well\nthe state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now\nand then wakes up, exercises his reason and finds himself a\ntrue prince.",
        "Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In history our\nimagination plays us false. Kingdom and lordship, power\nand estate, are a gaudier vocabulary than private John and\nEdward in a small house and common day’s work; but the things\nof life are the same to both; the sum total of both is the\nsame. Why all this deference to Alfred and Scanderbeg and\nGustavus? Suppose they were virtuous; did they wear out\nvirtue? As great a stake depends on your private act to-day,\nas followed their public and renowned steps. When private men\nshall act with original views, the lustre will be transferred\nfrom the actions of kings to those of gentlemen.",
        "The world has been instructed by its kings, who have so\nmagnetized the eyes of nations. It has been taught by this\ncolossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from man\nto man. The joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere\nsuffered the king, the noble, or the great proprietor to\nwalk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale of\nmen and things and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not\nwith money but with honor, and represent the law in his\nperson, was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely\nsignified their consciousness of their own right and\ncomeliness, the right of every man.",
        "The magnetism which all original action exerts is explained\nwhen we inquire the reason of self-trust. Who is the Trustee?\nWhat is the aboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance\nmay be grounded? What is the nature and power of that science-\nbaffling star, without parallax, without calculable elements,\nwhich shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure\nactions, if the least mark of independence appear? The inquiry\nleads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of\nvirtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or Instinct.\nWe denote this primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later\nteachings are tuitions.  In that deep force, the last fact\nbehind which analysis cannot go, all things find their common\norigin. For the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we\nknow not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from\nspace, from light, from time, from man, but one with them and\nproceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and\nbeing also proceed. We first share the life by which things\nexist and afterwards see them as appearances in nature and\nforget that we have shared their cause. Here is the fountain\nof action and of thought. Here are the lungs of that inspiration\nwhich giveth man wisdom and which cannot be denied without\nimpiety and atheism. We lie in the lap of immense intelligence,\nwhich makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity.\nWhen we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of\nourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask whence\nthis comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all\nphilosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we\ncan affirm. Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts\nof his mind and his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to\nhis involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due. He may err\nin the expression of them, but he knows that these things are\nso, like day and night, not to be disputed. My wilful actions\nand acquisitions are but roving;—the idlest reverie, the\nfaintest native emotion, command my curiosity and respect.\nThoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of\nperceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily; for\nthey do not distinguish between perception and notion. They\nfancy that I choose to see this or that thing. But perception\nis not whimsical, but fatal. If I see a trait, my children\nwill see it after me, and in course of time all mankind,—\nalthough it may chance that no one has seen it before me.\nFor my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun.",
        "The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure\nthat it is profane to seek to interpose helps. It must be\nthat when God speaketh he should communicate, not one thing,\nbut all things; should fill the world with his voice; should\nscatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from the centre of\nthe present thought; and new date and new create the whole.\nWhenever a mind is simple and receives a divine wisdom, old\nthings pass away,—means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it\nlives now, and absorbs past and future into the present hour.\nAll things are made sacred by relation to it,—one as much\nas another. All things are dissolved to their centre by their\ncause, and in the universal miracle petty and particular\nmiracles disappear. If therefore a man claims to know and\nspeak of God and carries you backward to the phraseology of\nsome old mouldered nation in another country, in another world,\nbelieve him not. Is the acorn better than the oak which is its\nfulness and completion? Is the parent better than the child\ninto whom he has cast his ripened being? Whence then this\nworship of the past? The centuries are conspirators against\nthe sanity and authority of the soul. Time and space are but\nphysiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is\nlight: where it is, is day; where it was, is night; and history\nis an impertinence and an injury if it be any thing more than\na cheerful apologue or parable of my being and becoming.",
        "Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he\ndares not say ’I think,’ ’I am,’ but quotes some saint or\nsage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing\nrose. These roses under my window make no reference to former\nroses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they\nexist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is\nsimply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its\nexistence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts;\nin the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless\nroot there is no less. Its nature is satisfied and it\nsatisfies nature in all moments alike. But man postpones or\nremembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted\neye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround\nhim, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy\nand strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above\ntime.",
        "This should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intellects\ndare not yet hear God himself unless he speak the phraseology\nof I know not what David, or Jeremiah, or Paul. We shall not\nalways set so great a price on a few texts, on a few lives.\nWe are like children who repeat by rote the sentences of\ngrandames and tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men of\ntalents and character they chance to see,—painfully recollecting\nthe exact words they spoke; afterwards, when they come into the\npoint of view which those had who uttered these sayings, they\nunderstand them and are willing to let the words go; for at any\ntime they can use words as good when occasion comes. If we live\ntruly, we shall see truly.  It is as easy for the strong man to\nbe strong, as it is for the weak to be weak. When we have new\nperception, we shall gladly disburden the memory of its hoarded\ntreasures as old rubbish. When a man lives with God, his voice\nshall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of\nthe corn.",
        "And now at last the highest truth on this subject remains\nunsaid; probably cannot be said; for all that we say is\nthe far-off remembering of the intuition. That thought by\nwhat I can now nearest approach to say it, is this. When\ngood is near you, when you have life in yourself, it is not\nby any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the\nfootprints of any other; you shall not see the face of man;\nyou shall not hear any name;—the way, the thought, the good\nshall be wholly strange and new. It shall exclude example\nand experience. You take the way from man, not to man. All\npersons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers. Fear\nand hope are alike beneath it. There is somewhat low even\nin hope. In the hour of vision there is nothing that can\nbe called gratitude, nor properly joy. The soul raised over\npassion beholds identity and eternal causation, perceives\nthe self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself\nwith knowing that all things go well. Vast spaces of nature,\nthe Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea; long intervals of time,\nyears, centuries, are of no account. This which I think and\nfeel underlay every former state of life and circumstances,\nas it does underlie my present, and what is called life,\nand what is called death.",
        "Life only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the\ninstant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition\nfrom a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in\nthe darting to an aim. This one fact the world hates; that\nthe soul becomes; for that for ever degrades the past, turns\nall riches to poverty, all reputation to a shame, confounds\nthe saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas equally\naside. Why then do we prate of self-reliance? Inasmuch as\nthe soul is present there will be power not confident but\nagent. To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking.\nSpeak rather of that which relies because it works and is.\nWho has more obedience than I masters me, though he should\nnot raise his finger. Round him I must revolve by the\ngravitation of spirits. We fancy it rhetoric when we speak\nof eminent virtue.  We do not yet see that virtue is Height,\nand that a man or a company of men, plastic and permeable to\nprinciples, by the law of nature must overpower and ride all\ncities, nations, kings, rich men, poets, who are not.",
        "This is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this,\nas on every topic, the resolution of all into the ever-blessed\nONE. Self-existence is the attribute of the Supreme Cause,\nand it constitutes the measure of good by the degree in which\nit enters into all lower forms. All things real are so by so\nmuch virtue as they contain. Commerce, husbandry, hunting,\nwhaling, war, eloquence, personal weight, are somewhat, and\nengage my respect as examples of its presence and impure\naction. I see the same law working in nature for conservation\nand growth. Power is, in nature, the essential measure of right.\nNature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot\nhelp itself. The genesis and maturation of a planet, its poise\nand orbit, the bended tree recovering itself from the strong\nwind, the vital resources of every animal and vegetable, are\ndemonstrations of the self-sufficing and therefore self-relying\nsoul.",

How far off, how cool, how chaste\nthe persons look, begirt each one with a precinct or sanctuary!\nSo let us always sit. Why should we assume the faults of our\nfriend, or wife, or father, or child, because they sit around\nour hearth, or are said to have the same blood? All men have\nmy blood and I have all men’s. Not for that will I adopt their\npetulance or folly, even to the extent of being ashamed of it.\nBut your isolation must not be mechanical, but spiritual, that\nis, must be elevation.

This is to be done in our\nsmooth times by speaking the truth. Check this lying\nhospitality and lying affection. Live no longer to the\nexpectation of these deceived and deceiving people with\nwhom we converse.

I must be myself. I cannot break myself any\nlonger for you, or you. If you can love me for what I am,\nwe shall be the happier. If you cannot, I will still seek\nto deserve that you should. I will not hide my tastes or\naversions. I will so trust that what is deep is holy, that\nI will do strongly before the sun and moon whatever inly\nrejoices me and the heart appoints. If you are noble, I will\nlove you: if you are not, I will not hurt you and myself by\nhypocritical attentions.

Prayer\nlooks abroad and asks for some foreign addition to come\nthrough some foreign virtue, and loses itself in endless\nmazes of natural and supernatural, and mediatorial and\nmiraculous. Prayer that craves a particular commodity,\nany thing less than all good, is vicious. Prayer is the\ncontemplation of the facts of life from the highest point\nof view. It is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant\nsoul. It is the spirit of God pronouncing his works good.\nBut prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness\nand theft. It supposes dualism and not unity in nature and\nconsciousness. As soon as the man is at one with God, he\nwill not beg. He will then see prayer in all action. The\nprayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it, the\nprayer of the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar,\nare true prayers heard throughout nature, though for cheap\nends. Caratach, in Fletcher’s Bonduca, when admonished to\ninquire the mind of the god Audate, replies,—",
        "Another sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent\nis the want of self-reliance: it is infirmity of will.\nRegret calamities if you can thereby help the sufferer;\nif not, attend your own work and already the evil begins\nto be repaired. Our sympathy is just as base. We come to\nthem who weep foolishly and sit down and cry for company,\ninstead of imparting to them truth and health in rough\nelectric shocks, putting them once more in communication\nwith their own reason. The secret of fortune is joy in our\nhands. Welcome evermore to gods and men is the self-helping\nman. For him all doors are flung wide; him all tongues\ngreet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our\nlove goes out to him and embraces him because he did not\nneed it. We solicitously and apologetically caress and\ncelebrate him because he held on his way and scorned our\ndisapprobation. The gods love him because men hated him.\n\"To the persevering mortal,” said Zoroaster, “the blessed\nImmortals are swift.”",
        "As men’s prayers are a disease of the will, so are their\ncreeds a disease of the intellect.

Every new mind is a new classification. If it prove a\nmind of uncommon activity and power, a Locke, a Lavoisier, a\nHutton, a Bentham, a Fourier, it imposes its classification\non other men, and lo! a new system. In proportion to the\ndepth of the thought, and so to the number of the objects\nit touches and brings within reach of the pupil, is his\ncomplacency. But chiefly is this apparent in creeds and\nchurches, which are also classifications of some powerful\nmind acting on the elemental thought of duty, and man’s\nrelation to the Highest. Such is Calvinism, Quakerism,\nSwedenborgism. The pupil takes the same delight in\nsubordinating every thing to the new terminology as a\ngirl who has just learned botany in seeing a new earth\nand new seasons thereby. It will happen for a time that\nthe pupil will find his intellectual power has grown by\nthe study of his master’s mind. But in all unbalanced\nminds the classification is idolized, passes for the end\nand not for a speedily exhaustible means, so that the\nwalls of the system blend to their eye in the remote\nhorizon with the walls of the universe; the luminaries\nof heaven seem to them hung on the arch their master\nbuilt. They cannot imagine how you aliens have any right\nto see,—how you can see; ’It must be somehow that you\nstole the light from us.’ They do not yet perceive that\nlight, unsystematic, indomitable, will break into any\ncabin, even into theirs. Let them chirp awhile and call\nit their own. If they are honest and do well, presently\ntheir neat new pinfold will be too strait and low, will\ncrack, will lean, will rot and vanish, and the immortal\nlight, all young and joyful, million-orbed, million-\ncolored, will beam over the universe as on the first\nmorning.",

        "3. But the rage of travelling is a symptom of a deeper\nunsoundness affecting the whole intellectual action. The\nintellect is vagabond, and our system of education fosters\nrestlessness. Our minds travel when our bodies are forced\nto stay at home. We imitate; and what is imitation but the\ntravelling of the mind? Our houses are built with foreign\ntaste; our shelves are garnished with foreign ornaments;\nour opinions, our tastes, our faculties, lean, and follow\nthe Past and the Distant. The soul created the arts wherever\nthey have flourished. It was in his own mind that the artist\nsought his model. It was an application of his own thought\nto the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed.\nAnd why need we copy the Doric or the Gothic model? Beauty,\nconvenience, grandeur of thought and quaint expression are\nas near to us as to any, and if the American artist will\nstudy with hope and love the precise thing to be done by\nhim, considering the climate, the soil, the length of the\nday, the wants of the people, the habit and form of the\ngovernment, he will create a house in which all these will\nfind themselves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be\nsatisfied also.",
        "Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can\npresent every moment with the cumulative force of a whole\nlife’s cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another\nyou have only an extemporaneous half possession. That which\neach can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No man\nyet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited\nit. Where is the master who could have taught Shakspeare?\nWhere is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or\nWashington, or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is a unique.\nThe Scipionism of Scipio is precisely that part he could not\nborrow. Shakspeare will never be made by the study of\nShakspeare. Do that which is assigned you, and you cannot\nhope too much or dare too much. There is at this moment for\nyou an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal\nchisel of Phidias, or trowel of the Egyptians, or the pen\nof Moses or Dante, but different from all these. Not possibly\nwill the soul, all rich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven\ntongue, deign to repeat itself; but if you can hear what\nthese patriarchs say, surely you can reply to them in the\nsame pitch of voice; for the ear and the tongue are two\norgans of one nature. Abide in the simple and noble regions\nof thy life, obey thy heart and thou shalt reproduce the\nForeworld again.",
        "4. As our Religion, our Education, our Art look abroad, so\ndoes our spirit of society. All men plume themselves on the\nimprovement of society, and no man improves.",
        "Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as\nit gains on the other. It undergoes continual changes; it\nis barbarous, it is civilized, it is christianized, it is\nrich, it is scientific; but this change is not amelioration.\nFor every thing that is given something is taken. Society\nacquires new arts and loses old instincts. What a contrast\nbetween the well-clad, reading, writing, thinking American,\nwith a watch, a pencil and a bill of exchange in his pocket,\nand the naked New Zealander, whose property is a club, a\nspear, a mat and an undivided twentieth of a shed to sleep\nunder! But compare the health of the two men and you shall\nsee that the white man has lost his aboriginal strength. If\nthe traveller tell us truly, strike the savage with a broad\naxe and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and heal as if\nyou struck the blow into soft pitch, and the same blow shall\nsend the white to his grave.",
        "The civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the use\nof his feet. He is supported on crutches, but lacks so much\nsupport of muscle. He has a fine Geneva watch, but he fails\nof the skill to tell the hour by the sun. A Greenwich nautical\nalmanac he has, and so being sure of the information when he\nwants it, the man in the street does not know a star in the\nsky. The solstice he does not observe; the equinox he knows\nas little; and the whole bright calendar of the year is\nwithout a dial in his mind. His note-books impair his memory;\nhis libraries overload his wit; the insurance-office increases\nthe number of accidents; and it may be a question whether\nmachinery does not encumber; whether we have not lost by\nrefinement some energy, by a Christianity entrenched in\nestablishments and forms some vigor of wild virtue. For\nevery Stoic was a Stoic; but in Christendom where is the\nChristian?",
        "There is no more deviation in the moral standard than in\nthe standard of height or bulk. No greater men are now\nthan ever were. A singular equality may be observed between\nthe great men of the first and of the last ages; nor can\nall the science, art, religion, and philosophy of the\nnineteenth century avail to educate greater men than\nPlutarch’s heroes, three or four and twenty centuries ago.\nNot in time is the race progressive. Phocion, Socrates,\nAnaxagoras, Diogenes, are great men, but they leave no\nclass. He who is really of their class will not be called\nby their name, but will be his own man, and in his turn the\nfounder of a sect. The arts and inventions of each period\nare only its costume and do not invigorate men. The harm of\nthe improved machinery may compensate its good. Hudson and\nBehring accomplished so much in their fishing-boats as to\nastonish Parry and Franklin, whose equipment exhausted the\nresources of science and art. Galileo, with an opera-glass,\ndiscovered a more splendid series of celestial phenomena\nthan any one since. Columbus found the New World in an\nundecked boat. It is curious to see the periodical disuse\nand perishing of means and machinery which were introduced\nwith loud laudation a few years or centuries before. The\ngreat genius returns to essential man. We reckoned the\nimprovements of the art of war among the triumphs of science,\nand yet Napoleon conquered Europe by the bivouac, which\nconsisted of falling back on naked valor and disencumbering\nit of all aids. The Emperor held it impossible to make a\nperfect army, says Las Cases, “without abolishing our arms,\nmagazines, commissaries and carriages, until, in imitation\nof the Roman custom, the soldier should receive his supply\nof corn, grind it in his hand-mill, and bake his bread\nhimself.”",
        "Society is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water\nof which it is composed does not. The same particle does\nnot rise from the valley to the ridge. Its unity is only\nphenomenal. The persons who make up a nation to-day, next\nyear die, and their experience with them.",
        "And so the reliance on Property, including the reliance\non governments which protect it, is the want of self-\nreliance. Men have looked away from themselves and at things\nso long that they have come to esteem the religious, learned\nand civil institutions as guards of property, and they\ndeprecate assaults on these, because they feel them to be\nassaults on property. They measure their esteem of each other\nby what each has, and not by what each is. But a cultivated\nman becomes ashamed of his property, out of new respect for\nhis nature. Especially he hates what he has if he see that it\nis accidental,—came to him by inheritance, or gift, or crime;\nthen he feels that it is not having; it does not belong to him,\nhas no root in him and merely lies there because no revolution\nor no robber takes it away. But that which a man is, does\nalways by necessity acquire, and what the man acquires is\nliving property, which does not wait the beck of rulers, or\nmobs, or revolutions, or fire, or storm, or bankruptcies, but\nperpetually renews itself wherever the man breathes. “Thy lot\nor portion of life,” said the Caliph Ali, “is seeking after\nthee; therefore be at rest from seeking after it.” Our\ndependence on these foreign goods leads us to our slavish\nrespect for numbers. The political parties meet in numerous\nconventions; the greater the concourse and with each new\nuproar of announcement, The delegation from Essex! The\nDemocrats from New Hampshire! The Whigs of Maine! the young\npatriot feels himself stronger than before by a new thousand\nof eyes and arms. In like manner the reformers summon\nconventions and vote and resolve in multitude.  Not so, O\nfriends! will the God deign to enter and inhabit you, but\nby a method precisely the reverse. It is only as a man puts\noff all foreign support and stands alone that I see him to\nbe strong and to prevail. He is weaker by every recruit to\nhis banner. Is not a man better than a town? Ask nothing of\nmen, and, in the endless mutation, thou only firm column must\npresently appear the upholder of all that surrounds thee.  He\nwho knows that power is inborn, that he is weak because he has\nlooked for good out of him and elsewhere, and so perceiving,\nthrows himself unhesitatingly on his thought, instantly rights\nhimself, stands in the erect position, commands his limbs,\nworks miracles; just as a man who stands on his feet is\nstronger than a man who stands on his head.",
        "So use all that is called Fortune. Most men gamble with\nher, and gain all, and lose all, as her wheel rolls. But\ndo thou leave as unlawful these winnings, and deal with\nCause and Effect, the chancellors of God. In the Will work\nand acquire, and thou hast chained the wheel of Chance, and\nshalt sit hereafter out of fear from her rotations. A\npolitical victory, a rise of rents, the recovery of your sick\nor the return of your absent friend, or some other favorable\nevent raises your spirits, and you think good days are\npreparing for you. Do not believe it. Nothing can bring you\npeace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the\ntriumph of principles.",
        "Ever since I was a boy I have wished to write a discourse\non Compensation; for it seemed to me when very young that\non this subject life was ahead of theology and the people\nknew more than the preachers taught. The documents too\nfrom which the doctrine is to be drawn, charmed my fancy\nby their endless variety, and lay always before me, even\nin sleep; for they are the tools in our hands, the bread\nin our basket, the transactions of the street, the farm\nand the dwelling-house; greetings, relations, debts and\ncredits, the influence of character, the nature and\nendowment of all men. It seemed to me also that in it\nmight be shown men a ray of divinity, the present action of\nthe soul of this world, clean from all vestige of tradition;\nand so the heart of man might be bathed by an inundation of\neternal love, conversing with that which he knows was always\nand always must be, because it really is now. It appeared\nmoreover that if this doctrine could be stated in terms with\nany resemblance to those bright intuitions in which this\ntruth is sometimes revealed to us, it would be a star in many\ndark hours and crooked passages in our journey, that would\nnot suffer us to lose our way.",
        "I was lately confirmed in these desires by hearing a sermon\nat church. The preacher, a man esteemed for his orthodoxy,\nunfolded in the ordinary manner the doctrine of the Last\nJudgment. He assumed that judgment is not executed in this\nworld; that the wicked are successful; that the good are\nmiserable; and then urged from reason and from Scripture a\ncompensation to be made to both parties in the next life.\nNo offence appeared to be taken by the congregation at this\ndoctrine. As far as I could observe when the meeting broke\nup they separated without remark on the sermon.",
        "Yet what was the import of this teaching? What did the\npreacher mean by saying that the good are miserable in\nthe present life? Was it that houses and lands, offices,\nwine, horses, dress, luxury, are had by unprincipled men,\nwhilst the saints are poor and despised; and that a\ncompensation is to be made to these last hereafter, by\ngiving them the like gratifications another day,—bank-\nstock and doubloons, venison and champagne? This must be\nthe compensation intended; for what else? Is it that they\nare to have leave to pray and praise? to love and serve\nmen? Why, that they can do now. The legitimate inference\nthe disciple would draw was,—’We are to have such a good\ntime as the sinners have now’;—or, to push it to its\nextreme import,—’You sin now; we shall sin by and by; we\nwould sin now, if we could; not being successful, we\nexpect our revenge to-morrow.’",
        "The fallacy lay in the immense concession that the bad are\nsuccessful; that justice is not done now. The blindness of\nthe preacher consisted in deferring to the base estimate\nof the market of what constitutes a manly success, instead\nof confronting and convicting the world from the truth;\nannouncing the presence of the soul; the omnipotence of\nthe will; and so establishing the standard of good and\nill, of success and falsehood.",
        "I find a similar base tone in the popular religious works\nof the day and the same doctrines assumed by the literary\nmen when occasionally they treat the related topics. I\nthink that our popular theology has gained in decorum, and\nnot in principle, over the superstitions it has displaced.\nBut men are better than their theology. Their daily life\ngives it the lie. Every ingenuous and aspiring soul leaves\nthe doctrine behind him in his own experience, and all men\nfeel sometimes the falsehood which they cannot demonstrate.\nFor men are wiser than they know. That which they hear in\nschools and pulpits without afterthought, if said in\nconversation would probably be questioned in silence. If a\nman dogmatize in a mixed company on Providence and the\ndivine laws, he is answered by a silence which conveys well\nenough to an observer the dissatisfaction of the hearer, but\nhis incapacity to make his own statement.",

        "POLARITY, or action and reaction, we meet in every part\nof nature; in darkness and light; in heat and cold; in\nthe ebb and flow of waters; in male and female; in the\ninspiration and expiration of plants and animals; in the\nequation of quantity and quality in the fluids of the\nanimal body; in the systole and diastole of the heart;\nin the undulations of fluids, and of sound; in the\ncentrifugal and centripetal gravity; in electricity,\ngalvanism, and chemical affinity. Superinduce magnetism\nat one end of a needle, the opposite magnetism takes\nplace at the other end. If the south attracts, the north\nrepels. To empty here, you must condense there. An\ninevitable dualism bisects nature, so that each thing\nis a half, and suggests another thing to make it whole;\nas, spirit, matter; man, woman; odd, even; subjective,\nobjective; in, out; upper, under; motion, rest; yea, nay.",
        "Whilst the world is thus dual, so is every one of its parts.\nThe entire system of things gets represented in every particle.\nThere is somewhat that resembles the ebb and flow of the sea,\nday and night, man and woman, in a single needle of the pine,\nin a kernel of corn, in each individual of every animal tribe.\nThe reaction, so grand in the elements, is repeated within\nthese small boundaries. For example, in the animal kingdom\nthe physiologist has observed that no creatures are favorites,\nbut a certain compensation balances every gift and every defect.\nA surplusage given to one part is paid out of a reduction from\nanother part of the same creature. If the head and neck are\nenlarged, the trunk and extremities are cut short.",
        "The theory of the mechanic forces is another example. What\nwe gain in power is lost in time, and the converse. The\nperiodic or compensating errors of the planets is another\ninstance. The influences of climate and soil in political\nhistory are another. The cold climate invigorates. The\nbarren soil does not breed fevers, crocodiles, tigers or\nscorpions.",
        "The same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man.\nEvery excess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every\nsweet hath its sour; every evil its good. Every faculty\nwhich is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on\nits abuse. It is to answer for its moderation with its life.\nFor every grain of wit there is a grain of folly. For every\nthing you have missed, you have gained something else; and\nfor every thing you gain, you lose something. If riches\nincrease, they are increased that use them. If the gatherer\ngathers too much, Nature takes out of the man what she puts\ninto his chest; swells the estate, but kills the owner.\nNature hates monopolies and exceptions. The waves of the sea\ndo not more speedily seek a level from their loftiest tossing\nthan the varieties of condition tend to equalize themselves.\nThere is always some levelling circumstance that puts down\nthe overbearing, the strong, the rich, the fortunate,\nsubstantially on the same ground with all others. Is a man\ntoo strong and fierce for society and by temper and position\na bad citizen,—a morose ruffian, with a dash of the pirate\nin him?—Nature sends him a troop of pretty sons and daughters\nwho are getting along in the dame’s classes at the village\nschool, and love and fear for them smooths his grim scowl to\ncourtesy. Thus she contrives to intenerate the granite and\nfelspar, takes the boar out and puts the lamb in and keeps\nher balance true.",

Neither has this an immunity. He who\nby force of will or of thought is great and overlooks\nthousands, has the charges of that eminence. With every\ninflux of light comes new danger. Has he light? he must\nbear witness to the light, and always outrun that sympathy\nwhich gives him such keen satisfaction, by his fidelity to\nnew revelations of the incessant soul.

Res nolunt diu male administrari.\nThough no checks to a new evil appear, the checks exist,\nand will appear. If the government is cruel, the governor’s\nlife is not safe. If you tax too high, the revenue will\nyield nothing. If you make the criminal code sanguinary,\njuries will not convict. If the law is too mild, private\nvengeance comes in. If the government is a terrific democracy,\nthe pressure is resisted by an over-charge of energy in the\ncitizen, and life glows with a fiercer flame. The true life\nand satisfactions of man seem to elude the utmost rigors or\nfelicities of condition and to establish themselves with\ngreat indifferency under all varieties of circumstances.\nUnder all governments the influence of character remains\nthe same,—in Turkey and in New England about alike. Under\nthe primeval despots of Egypt, history honestly confesses\nthat man must have been as free as culture could make him.",
        "These appearances indicate the fact that the universe is\nrepresented in every one of its particles. Every thing in\nnature contains all the powers of nature. Every thing is\nmade of one hidden stuff; as the naturalist sees one type\nunder every metamorphosis, and regards a horse as a running\nman, a fish as a swimming man, a bird as a flying man, a\ntree as a rooted man. Each new form repeats not only the\nmain character of the type, but part for part all the\ndetails, all the aims, furtherances, hindrances, energies\nand whole system of every other. Every occupation, trade,\nart, transaction, is a compend of the world and a\ncorrelative of every other. Each one is an entire emblem of\nhuman life; of its good and ill, its trials, its enemies,\nits course and its end. And each one must somehow accommodate\nthe whole man and recite all his destiny.",

Eyes, ears, taste, smell, motion, resistance,\nappetite, and organs of reproduction that take hold on\neternity,—all find room to consist in the small creature.\nSo do we put our life into every act. The true doctrine of\nomnipresence is that God reappears with all his parts in\nevery moss and cobweb. The value of the universe contrives\nto throw itself into every point. If the good is there, so\nis the evil; if the affinity, so the repulsion; if the\nforce, so the limitation.",
        "Thus is the universe alive. All things are moral. That soul\nwhich within us is a sentiment, outside of us is a law.

A perfect equity adjusts\nits balance in all parts of life.  Hoi kuboi Dios aei\neupiptousi,—The dice of God are always loaded. The world\nlooks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation,\nwhich, turn it how you will, balances itself. Take what\nfigure you will, its exact value, nor more nor less, still\nreturns to you. Every secret is told, every crime is punished,\nevery virtue rewarded, every wrong redressed, in silence and\ncertainty. What we call retribution is the universal necessity\nby which the whole appears wherever a part appears. If you see\nsmoke, there must be fire. If you see a hand or a limb, you\nknow that the trunk to which it belongs is there behind.",
        "Every act rewards itself, or, in other words integrates\nitself, in a twofold manner; first in the thing, or in\nreal nature; and secondly in the circumstance, or in\napparent nature. Men call the circumstance the retribution.\nThe causal retribution is in the thing and is seen by the\nsoul. The retribution in the circumstance is seen by the\nunderstanding; it is inseparable from the thing, but is\noften spread over a long time and so does not become\ndistinct until after many years. The specific stripes may\nfollow late after the offence, but they follow because\nthey accompany it. Crime and punishment grow out of one\nstem.  Punishment is a fruit that unsuspected ripens within\nthe flower of the pleasure which concealed it. Cause and\neffect, means and ends, seed and fruit, cannot be severed;\nfor the effect already blooms in the cause, the end\npreexists in the means, the fruit in the seed.",
        "Whilst thus the world will be whole and refuses to be\ndisparted, we seek to act partially, to sunder, to\nappropriate; for example,—to gratify the senses we sever\nthe pleasure of the senses from the needs of the character.\nThe ingenuity of man has always been dedicated to the\nsolution of one problem,—how to detach the sensual sweet,\nthe sensual strong, the sensual bright, etc., from the\nmoral sweet, the moral deep, the moral fair; that is, again,\nto contrive to cut clean off this upper surface so thin as\nto leave it bottomless; to get a one end, without an other\nend. The soul says, ’Eat;’ the body would feast. The soul\nsays, ’The man and woman shall be one flesh and one soul;’\nthe body would join the flesh only. The soul says, ’Have\ndominion over all things to the ends of virtue;’ the body\nwould have the power over things to its own ends.",
        "The soul strives amain to live and work through all things.\nIt would be the only fact. All things shall be added unto\nit,—power, pleasure, knowledge, beauty. The particular\nman aims to be somebody; to set up for himself; to truck\nand higgle for a private good; and, in particulars, to ride\nthat he may ride; to dress that he may be dressed; to eat\nthat he may eat; and to govern, that he may be seen. Men\nseek to be great; they would have offices, wealth, power,\nand fame. They think that to be great is to possess one side\nof nature,—the sweet, without the other side, the bitter.",
        "This dividing and detaching is steadily counteracted. Up\nto this day it must be owned no projector has had the\nsmallest success. The parted water reunites behind our\nhand. Pleasure is taken out of pleasant things, profit\nout of profitable things, power out of strong things, as\nsoon as we seek to separate them from the whole. We can\nno more halve things and get the sensual good, by itself,\nthan we can get an inside that shall have no outside, or\na light without a shadow. “Drive out Nature with a fork,\nshe comes running back.”",
        "Life invests itself with inevitable conditions, which\nthe unwise seek to dodge, which one and another brags\nthat he does not know, that they do not touch him;—but\nthe brag is on his lips, the conditions are in his soul.\nIf he escapes them in one part they attack him in another\nmore vital part. If he has escaped them in form and in\nthe appearance, it is because he has resisted his life\nand fled from himself, and the retribution is so much\ndeath. So signal is the failure of all attempts to make\nthis separation of the good from the tax, that the\nexperiment would not be tried,—since to try it is to be\nmad,—but for the circumstance, that when the disease\nbegan in the will, of rebellion and separation, the\nintellect is at once infected, so that the man ceases to\nsee God whole in each object, but is able to see the\nsensual allurement of an object and not see the sensual\nhurt; he sees the mermaid’s head but not the dragon’s\ntail, and thinks he can cut off that which he would have\nfrom that which he would not have. “How secret art thou\nwho dwellest in the highest heavens in silence, O thou\nonly great God, sprinkling with an unwearied providence\ncertain penal blindnesses upon such as have unbridled\ndesires!\"1",

        "A plain confession of the in-working of the All and of\nits moral aim. The Indian mythology ends in the same\nethics; and it would seem impossible for any fable to be\ninvented and get any currency which was not moral. Aurora\nforgot to ask youth for her lover, and though Tithonus is\nimmortal, he is old. Achilles is not quite invulnerable;\nthe sacred waters did not wash the heel by which Thetis\nheld him. Siegfried, in the Nibelungen, is not quite\nimmortal, for a leaf fell on his back whilst he was\nbathing in the dragon’s blood, and that spot which it\ncovered is mortal. And so it must be. There is a crack\nin every thing God has made. It would seem there is always\nthis vindictive circumstance stealing in at unawares even\ninto the wild poesy in which the human fancy attempted to\nmake bold holiday and to shake itself free of the old laws,\n—this back-stroke, this kick of the gun, certifying that\nthe law is fatal; that in nature nothing can be given, all\nthings are sold.",

Or rather it\nis a harpoon hurled at the whale, unwinding, as it flies,\na coil of cord in the boat, and, if the harpoon is not\ngood, or not well thrown, it will go nigh to cut the\nsteersman in twain or to sink the boat.",
        "You cannot do wrong without suffering wrong. “No man had\never a point of pride that was not injurious to him,” said\nBurke. The exclusive in fashionable life does not see that\nhe excludes himself from enjoyment, in the attempt to\nappropriate it. The exclusionist in religion does not see\nthat he shuts the door of heaven on himself, in striving\nto shut out others. Treat men as pawns and ninepins and you\nshall suffer as well as they. If you leave out their heart,\nyou shall lose your own. The senses would make things of all\npersons; of women, of children, of the poor. The vulgar\nproverb, “I will get it from his purse or get it from his\nskin,” is sound philosophy.",
        "All infractions of love and equity in our social relations\nare speedily punished. They are punished by fear.  Whilst\nI stand in simple relations to my fellow-man, I have no\ndispleasure in meeting him. We meet as water meets water,\nor as two currents of air mix, with perfect diffusion and\ninterpenetration of nature.  But as soon as there is any\ndeparture from simplicity, and attempt at halfness, or good\nfor me that is not good for him, my neighbor feels the wrong;\nhe shrinks from me as far as I have shrunk from him; his\neyes no longer seek mine; there is war between us; there is\nhate in him and fear in me.",
        "All the old abuses in society, universal and particular,\nall unjust accumulations of property and power, are avenged\nin the same manner. Fear is an instructor of great sagacity\nand the herald of all revolutions. One thing he teaches,\nthat there is rottenness where he appears. He is a carrion\ncrow, and though you see not well what he hovers for, there\nis death somewhere. Our property is timid, our laws are\ntimid, our cultivated classes are timid. Fear for ages has\nboded and mowed and gibbered over government and property.\nThat obscene bird is not there for nothing. He indicates\ngreat wrongs which must be revised.",
        "Of the like nature is that expectation of change which\ninstantly follows the suspension of our voluntary activity.\nThe terror of cloudless noon, the emerald of Polycrates,\nthe awe of prosperity, the instinct which leads every\ngenerous soul to impose on itself tasks of a noble\nasceticism and vicarious virtue, are the tremblings of\nthe balance of justice through the heart and mind of man.",
        "Experienced men of the world know very well that it is\nbest to pay scot and lot as they go along, and that a\nman often pays dear for a small frugality. The borrower\nruns in his own debt. Has a man gained any thing who has\nreceived a hundred favors and rendered none? Has he gained\nby borrowing, through indolence or cunning, his neighbor’s\nwares, or horses, or money? There arises on the deed the\ninstant acknowledgment of benefit on the one part and of\ndebt on the other; that is, of superiority and inferiority.\nThe transaction remains in the memory of himself and his\nneighbor; and every new transaction alters according to\nits nature their relation to each other. He may soon come\nto see that he had better have broken his own bones than\nto have ridden in his neighbor’s coach, and that “the\nhighest price he can pay for a thing is to ask for it.”",
        "A wise man will extend this lesson to all parts of life,\nand know that it is the part of prudence to face every\nclaimant and pay every just demand on your time, your\ntalents, or your heart. Always pay; for first or last\nyou must pay your entire debt. Persons and events may\nstand for a time between you and justice, but it is only\na postponement. You must pay at last your own debt. If\nyou are wise you will dread a prosperity which only loads\nyou with more. Benefit is the end of nature. But for every\nbenefit which you receive, a tax is levied. He is great\nwho confers the most benefits. He is base,—and that is\nthe one base thing in the universe,—to receive favors\nand render none. In the order of nature we cannot render\nbenefits to those from whom we receive them, or only seldom.\nBut the benefit we receive must be rendered again, line for\nline, deed for deed, cent for cent, to somebody. Beware of\ntoo much good staying in your hand. It will fast corrupt and\nworm worms. Pay it away quickly in some sort.",
        "Labor is watched over by the same pitiless laws. Cheapest,\nsay the prudent, is the dearest labor. What we buy in a\nbroom, a mat, a wagon, a knife, is some application of\ngood sense to a common want. It is best to pay in your\nland a skilful gardener, or to buy good sense applied to\ngardening; in your sailor, good sense applied to navigation;\nin the house, good sense applied to cooking, sewing, serving;\nin your agent, good sense applied to accounts and affairs.\nSo do you multiply your presence, or spread yourself throughout\nyour estate. But because of the dual constitution of things,\nin labor as in life there can be no cheating. The thief steals\nfrom himself. The swindler swindles himself. For the real price\nof labor is knowledge and virtue, whereof wealth and credit are\nsigns. These signs, like paper money, may be counterfeited or\nstolen, but that which they represent, namely, knowledge and\nvirtue, cannot be counterfeited or stolen. These ends of labor\ncannot be answered but by real exertions of the mind, and in\nobedience to pure motives. The cheat, the defaulter, the\ngambler, cannot extort the knowledge of material and moral\nnature which his honest care and pains yield to the operative.\nThe law of nature is, Do the thing, and you shall have the\nPower; but they who do not the thing have not the power.",
        "Human labor, through all its forms, from the sharpening\nof a stake to the construction of a city or an epic, is\none immense illustration of the perfect compensation of\nthe universe. The absolute balance of Give and Take, the\ndoctrine that every thing has its price,—and if that\nprice is not paid, not that thing but something else is\nobtained, and that it is impossible to get any thing\nwithout its price,—is not less sublime in the columns\nof a leger than in the budgets of states, in the laws of\nlight and darkness, in all the action and reaction of\nnature. I cannot doubt that the high laws which each man\nsees implicated in those processes with which he is\nconversant, the stern ethics which sparkle on his chisel-\nedge, which are measured out by his plumb and foot-rule,\nwhich stand as manifest in the footing of the shop-bill\nas in the history of a state,—do recommend to him his\ntrade, and though seldom named, exalt his business to his\nimagination.",
        "The league between virtue and nature engages all things\nto assume a hostile front to vice. The beautiful laws and\nsubstances of the world persecute and whip the traitor.\nHe finds that things are arranged for truth and benefit,\nbut there is no den in the wide world to hide a rogue.\nCommit a crime, and the earth is made of glass. Commit a\ncrime, and it seems as if a coat of snow fell on the ground,\nsuch as reveals in the woods the track of every partridge\nand fox and squirrel and mole. You cannot recall the spoken\nword, you cannot wipe out the foot-track, you cannot draw\nup the ladder, so as to leave no inlet or clew.  Some\ndamning circumstance always transpires. The laws and\nsubstances of nature,—water, snow, wind, gravitation,—\nbecome penalties to the thief.",
        "On the other hand the law holds with equal sureness for\nall right action. Love, and you shall be loved. All love\nis mathematically just, as much as the two sides of an\nalgebraic equation. The good man has absolute good, which\nlike fire turns every thing to its own nature, so that you\ncannot do him any harm; but as the royal armies sent against\nNapoleon, when he approached cast down their colors and from\nenemies became friends, so disasters of all kinds, as\nsickness, offence, poverty, prove benefactors:—",
        "The good are befriended even by weakness and defect. As no\nman had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him,\nso no man had ever a defect that was not somewhere made\nuseful to him. The stag in the fable admired his horns and\nblamed his feet, but when the hunter came, his feet saved\nhim, and afterwards, caught in the thicket, his horns\ndestroyed him. Every man in his lifetime needs to thank his\nfaults. As no man thoroughly understands a truth until he\nhas contended against it, so no man has a thorough acquaintance\nwith the hindrances or talents of men until he has suffered\nfrom the one and seen the triumph of the other over his own\nwant of the same. Has he a defect of temper that unfits him\nto live in society? Thereby he is driven to entertain himself\nalone and acquire habits of self-help; and thus, like the\nwounded oyster, he mends his shell with pearl.",
        "Our strength grows out of our weakness. The indignation\nwhich arms itself with secret forces does not awaken\nuntil we are pricked and stung and sorely assailed. A\ngreat man is always willing to be little.  Whilst he sits\non the cushion of advantages, he goes to sleep. When he\nis pushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn\nsomething; he has been put on his wits, on his manhood;\nhe has gained facts; learns his ignorance; is cured of\nthe insanity of conceit; has got moderation and real\nskill. The wise man throws himself on the side of his\nassailants. It is more his interest than it is theirs\nto find his weak point. The wound cicatrizes and falls\noff from him like a dead skin and when they would triumph,\nlo! he has passed on invulnerable. Blame is safer than\npraise. I hate to be defended in a newspaper. As long as\nall that is said is said against me, I feel a certain\nassurance of success. But as soon as honeyed words of\npraise are spoken for me I feel as one that lies\nunprotected before his enemies. In general, every evil\nto which we do not succumb is a benefactor. As the Sandwich\nIslander believes that the strength and valor of the enemy\nhe kills passes into himself, so we gain the strength of the\ntemptation we resist.",
        "The same guards which protect us from disaster, defect,\nand enmity, defend us, if we will, from selfishness and\nfraud. Bolts and bars are not the best of our institutions,\nnor is shrewdness in trade a mark of wisdom. Men suffer\nall their life long under the foolish superstition that\nthey can be cheated. But it is as impossible for a man\nto be cheated by any one but himself, as for a thing to\nbe and not to be at the same time. There is a third silent\nparty to all our bargains. The nature and soul of things\ntakes on itself the guaranty of the fulfilment of every\ncontract, so that honest service cannot come to loss. If\nyou serve an ungrateful master, serve him the more. Put\nGod in your debt. Every stroke shall be repaid. The longer\nThe payment is withholden, the better for you; for compound\ninterest on compound interest is the rate and usage of this\nexchequer.",
        "The history of persecution is a history of endeavors to\ncheat nature, to make water run up hill, to twist a rope\nof sand. It makes no difference whether the actors be many\nor one, a tyrant or a mob. A mob is a society of bodies\nvoluntarily bereaving themselves of reason and traversing\nits work. The mob is man voluntarily descending to the\nnature of the beast. Its fit hour of activity is night.\nIts actions are insane like its whole constitution. It\npersecutes a principle; it would whip a right; it would\ntar and feather justice, by inflicting fire and outrage\nupon the houses and persons of those who have these. It\nresembles the prank of boys, who run with fire-engines to\nput out the ruddy aurora streaming to the stars. The\ninviolate spirit turns their spite against the wrongdoers.\nThe martyr cannot be dishonored. Every lash inflicted is a\ntongue of fame; every prison, a more illustrious abode;\nevery burned book or house enlightens the world; every\nsuppressed or expunged word reverberates through the earth\nfrom side to side. Hours of sanity and consideration are\nalways arriving to communities, as to individuals, when the\ntruth is seen and the martyrs are justified.",
        "Thus do all things preach the indifferency of circumstances.\nThe man is all. Every thing has two sides, a good and an\nevil. Every advantage has its tax. I learn to be content.\nBut the doctrine of compensation is not the doctrine of\nindifferency. The thoughtless say, on hearing these\nrepresentations,—What boots it to do well? there is one\nevent to good and evil; if I gain any good I must pay for\nit; if I lose any good I gain some other; all actions are\nindifferent.",
        "There is a deeper fact in the soul than compensation, to\nwit, its own nature. The soul is not a compensation, but\na life. The soul is. Under all this running sea of\ncircumstance, whose waters ebb and flow with perfect\nbalance, lies the aboriginal abyss of real Being. Essence,\nor God, is not a relation or a part, but the whole. Being\nis the vast affirmative, excluding negation, self-balanced,\nand swallowing up all relations, parts and times within\nitself. Nature, truth, virtue, are the influx from thence.\nVice is the absence or departure of the same. Nothing,\nFalsehood, may indeed stand as the great Night or shade on\nwhich as a background the living universe paints itself\nforth, but no fact is begotten by it; it cannot work, for\nit is not. It cannot work any good; it cannot work any harm.\nIt is harm inasmuch as it is worse not to be than to be.",
        "We feel defrauded of the retribution due to evil acts,\nbecause the criminal adheres to his vice and contumacy\nand does not come to a crisis or judgment anywhere in\nvisible nature. There is no stunning confutation of his\nnonsense before men and angels. Has he therefore outwitted\nthe law? Inasmuch as he carries the malignity and the lie\nwith him he so far deceases from nature. In some manner\nthere will be a demonstration of the wrong to the\nunderstanding also; but, should we not see it, this deadly\ndeduction makes square the eternal account.",
        "Neither can it be said, on the other hand, that the gain\nof rectitude must be bought by any loss. There is no\npenalty to virtue; no penalty to wisdom; they are proper\nadditions of being. In a virtuous action I properly am;\nin a virtuous act I add to the world; I plant into deserts\nconquered from Chaos and Nothing and see the darkness\nreceding on the limits of the horizon. There can be no\nexcess to love, none to knowledge, none to beauty, when\nthese attributes are considered in the purest sense. The\nsoul refuses limits, and always affirms an Optimism, never\na Pessimism.",
        "His life is a progress, and not a station. His instinct is\ntrust. Our instinct uses “more” and “less” in application\nto man, of the presence of the soul, and not of its absence,\nthe brave man is greater than the coward; the true, the\nbenevolent, the wise, is more a man and not less, than the\nfool and knave.  There is no tax on the good of virtue, for\nthat is the incoming of God himself, or absolute existence,\nwithout any comparative. Material good has its tax, and if\nit came without desert or sweat, has no root in me, and the\nnext wind will blow it away. But all the good of nature is\nthe soul’s, and may be had if paid for in nature’s lawful\ncoin, that is, by labor which the heart and the head allow.\nI no longer wish to meet a good I do not earn, for example\nto find a pot of buried gold, knowing that it brings with it\nnew burdens. I do not wish more external goods,—neither\npossessions, nor honors, nor powers, nor persons. The gain\nis apparent; the tax is certain. But there is no tax on the\nknowledge that the compensation exists and that it is not\ndesirable to dig up treasure. Herein I rejoice with a serene\neternal peace. I contract the boundaries of possible mischief.\nI learn the wisdom of St. Bernard,—\"Nothing can work me\ndamage except myself; the harm that I sustain I carry about\nwith me, and never am a real sufferer but by my own fault.”",
        "In the nature of the soul is the compensation for the\ninequalities of condition. The radical tragedy of nature\nseems to be the distinction of More and Less. How can\nLess not feel the pain; how not feel indignation or\nmalevolence towards More? Look at those who have less\nfaculty, and one feels sad and knows not well what to\nmake of it. He almost shuns their eye; he fears they will\nupbraid God. What should they do? It seems a great injustice.\nBut see the facts nearly and these mountainous inequalities\nvanish. Love reduces them as the sun melts the iceberg in\nthe sea. The heart and soul of all men being one, this\nbitterness of His and Mine ceases. His is mine. I am my\nbrother and my brother is me. If I feel overshadowed and\noutdone by great neighbors, I can yet love; I can still\nreceive; and he that loveth maketh his own the grandeur\nhe loves. Thereby I make the discovery that my brother is\nmy guardian, acting for me with the friendliest designs,\nand the estate I so admired and envied is my own. It is\nthe nature of the soul to appropriate all things. Jesus\nand Shakspeare are fragments of the soul, and by love I\nconquer and incorporate them in my own conscious domain.\nHis virtue,—is not that mine? His wit,—if it cannot be\nmade mine, it is not wit.",
        "Such also is the natural history of calamity. The changes\nwhich break up at short intervals the prosperity of men\nare advertisements of a nature whose law is growth. Every\nsoul is by this intrinsic necessity quitting its whole\nsystem of things, its friends and home and laws and faith,\nas the shell-fish crawls out of its beautiful but stony\ncase, because it no longer admits of its growth, and slowly\nforms a new house. In proportion to the vigor of the\nindividual these revolutions are frequent, until in some\nhappier mind they are incessant and all worldly relations\nhang very loosely about him, becoming as it were a\ntransparent fluid membrane through which the living form\nis seen, and not, as in most men, an indurated heterogeneous\nfabric of many dates and of no settled character, in which\nthe man is imprisoned. Then there can be enlargement, and\nthe man of to-day scarcely recognizes the man of yesterday.\nAnd such should be the outward biography of man in time, a\nputting off of dead circumstances day by day, as he renews\nhis raiment day by day. But to us, in our lapsed estate,\nresting, not advancing, resisting, not cooperating with the\ndivine expansion, this growth comes by shocks.",
        "We cannot part with our friends. We cannot let our angels\ngo. We do not see that they only go out that archangels\nmay come in. We are idolaters of the old. We do not believe\nin the riches of the soul, in its proper eternity and\nomnipresence. We do not believe there is any force in\nto-day to rival or recreate that beautiful yesterday. We\nlinger in the ruins of the old tent where once we had bread\nand shelter and organs, nor believe that the spirit can\nfeed, cover, and nerve us again. We cannot again find aught\nso dear, so sweet, so graceful. But we sit and weep in vain.\nThe voice of the Almighty saith, ’Up and onward for evermore!’\nWe cannot stay amid the ruins. Neither will we rely on the\nnew; and so we walk ever with reverted eyes, like those\nmonsters who look backwards.",
        "And yet the compensations of calamity are made apparent\nto the understanding also, after long intervals of time.\nA fever, a mutilation, a cruel disappointment, a loss of\nwealth, a loss of friends, seems at the moment unpaid\nloss, and unpayable. But the sure years reveal the deep\nremedial force that underlies all facts. The death of a\ndear friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing\nbut privation, somewhat later assumes the aspect of a\nguide or genius; for it commonly operates revolutions in\nour way of life, terminates an epoch of infancy or of\nyouth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up a wonted\noccupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows\nthe formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of\ncharacter. It permits or constrains the formation of new\nacquaintances and the reception of new influences that\nprove of the first importance to the next years; and the\nman or woman who would have remained a sunny garden-flower,\nwith no room for its roots and too much sunshine for its\nhead, by the falling of the walls and the neglect of the\ngardener is made the banian of the forest, yielding shade\nand fruit to wide neighborhoods of men.",
        "When the act of reflection takes place in the mind,\nwhen we look at ourselves in the light of thought, we\ndiscover that our life is embosomed in beauty. Behind\nus, as we go, all things assume pleasing forms, as\nclouds do far off. Not only things familiar and stale,\nbut even the tragic and terrible are comely as they\ntake their place in the pictures of memory. The river-\nbank, the weed at the water-side, the old house, the\nfoolish person, however neglected in the passing, have\na grace in the past. Even the corpse that has lain in\nthe chambers has added a solemn ornament to the house.\nThe soul will not know either deformity or pain. If in\nthe hours of clear reason we should speak the severest\ntruth, we should say that we had never made a sacrifice.\nIn these hours the mind seems so great that nothing can\nbe taken from us that seems much. All loss, all pain, is\nparticular; the universe remains to the heart unhurt.\nNeither vexations nor calamities abate our trust. No man\never stated his griefs as lightly as he might. Allow for\nexaggeration in the most patient and sorely ridden hack\nthat ever was driven. For it is only the finite that has\nwrought and suffered; the infinite lies stretched in\nsmiling repose.",
        "The intellectual life may be kept clean and healthful if\nman will live the life of nature and not import into his\nmind difficulties which are none of his. No man need be\nperplexed in his speculations. Let him do and say what\nstrictly belongs to him, and though very ignorant of\nbooks, his nature shall not yield him any intellectual\nobstructions and doubts. Our young people are diseased\nwith the theological problems of original sin, origin of\nevil, predestination and the like. These never presented\na practical difficulty to any man,—never darkened across\nany man’s road who did not go out of his way to seek them.\nThese are the soul’s mumps and measles and whooping-coughs,\nand those who have not caught them cannot describe their\nhealth or prescribe the cure. A simple mind will not know\nthese enemies. It is quite another thing that he should be\nable to give account of his faith and expound to another\nthe theory of his self-union and freedom. This requires\nrare gifts. Yet without this self-knowledge there may be\na sylvan strength and integrity in that which he is. “A\nfew strong instincts and a few plain rules” suffice us.",
        "My will never gave the images in my mind the rank they\nnow take. The regular course of studies, the years of\nacademical and professional education have not yielded\nme better facts than some idle books under the bench at\nthe Latin School. What we do not call education is more\nprecious than that which we call so. We form no guess,\nat the time of receiving a thought, of its comparative\nvalue. And education often wastes its effort in attempts\nto thwart and balk this natural magnetism, which is sure\nto select what belongs to it.",
        "In like manner our moral nature is vitiated by any\ninterference of our will. People represent virtue as a\nstruggle, and take to themselves great airs upon their\nattainments, and the question is everywhere vexed when\na noble nature is commended, whether the man is not\nbetter who strives with temptation. But there is no\nmerit in the matter. Either God is there or he is not\nthere. We love characters in proportion as they are\nimpulsive and spontaneous. The less a man thinks or\nknows about his virtues the better we like him.\nTimoleon’s victories are the best victories, which ran\nand flowed like Homer’s verses, Plutarch said.  When we\nsee a soul whose acts are all regal, graceful and pleasant\nas roses, we must thank God that such things can be and\nare, and not turn sourly on the angel and say ’Crump is\na better man with his grunting resistance to all his\nnative devils.’",
        "Not less conspicuous is the preponderance of nature over\nwill in all practical life. There is less intention in\nhistory than we ascribe to it. We impute deep-laid far-\nsighted plans to Caesar and Napoleon; but the best of\ntheir power was in nature, not in them. Men of an\nextraordinary success, in their honest moments, have\nalways sung, ’Not unto us, not unto us.’ According to\nthe faith of their times they have built altars to\nFortune, or to Destiny, or to St. Julian. Their success\nlay in their parallelism to the course of thought, which\nfound in them an unobstructed channel; and the wonders\nof which they were the visible conductors seemed to the\neye their deed. Did the wires generate the galvanism? It\nis even true that there was less in them on which they\ncould reflect than in another; as the virtue of a pipe\nis to be smooth and hollow. That which externally seemed\nwill and immovableness was willingness and self-annihilation.\nCould Shakspeare give a theory of Shakspeare? Could ever a\nman of prodigious mathematical genius convey to others any\ninsight into his methods? If he could communicate that\nsecret it would instantly lose its exaggerated value,\nblending with the daylight and the vital energy the\npower to stand and to go.",
        "The lesson is forcibly taught by these observations that\nour life might be much easier and simpler than we make\nit; that the world might be a happier place than it is;\nthat there is no need of struggles, convulsions, and\ndespairs, of the wringing of the hands and the gnashing\nof the teeth; that we miscreate our own evils. We interfere\nwith the optimism of nature; for whenever we get this\nvantage-ground of the past, or of a wiser mind in the\npresent, we are able to discern that we are begirt with\nlaws which execute themselves.",
        "The face of external nature teaches the same lesson.\nNature will not have us fret and fume. She does not\nlike our benevolence or our learning much better than\nshe likes our frauds and wars. When we come out of the\ncaucus, or the bank, or the Abolition-convention, or\nthe Temperance-meeting, or the Transcendental club into\nthe fields and woods, she says to us, ’So hot? my little\nSir.’",
        "We are full of mechanical actions. We must needs\nintermeddle and have things in our own way, until the\nsacrifices and virtues of society are odious. Love\nshould make joy; but our benevolence is unhappy. Our\nSunday-schools and churches and pauper-societies are\nyokes to the neck. We pain ourselves to please nobody.\nThere are natural ways of arriving at the same ends at\nwhich these aim, but do not arrive. Why should all\nvirtue work in one and the same way? Why should all give\ndollars? It is very inconvenient to us country folk, and\nwe do not think any good will come of it. We have not\ndollars; merchants have; let them give them. Farmers will\ngive corn; poets will sing; women will sew; laborers will\nlend a hand; the children will bring flowers. And why drag\nthis dead weight of a Sunday-school over the whole\nChristendom? It is natural and beautiful that childhood\nshould inquire and maturity should teach; but it is time\nenough to answer questions when they are asked. Do not\nshut up the young people against their will in a pew and\nforce the children to ask them questions for an hour\nagainst their will.",
        "If we look wider, things are all alike; laws and letters\nand creeds and modes of living seem a travesty of truth.\nOur society is encumbered by ponderous machinery, which\nresembles the endless aqueducts which the Romans built\nover hill and dale and which are superseded by the\ndiscovery of the law that water rises to the level of\nits source. It is a Chinese wall which any nimble Tartar\ncan leap over. It is a standing army, not so good as a\npeace. It is a graduated, titled, richly appointed empire,\nquite superfluous when town-meetings are found to answer\njust as well.",
        "Let us draw a lesson from nature, which always works by\nshort ways. When the fruit is ripe, it falls.  When the\nfruit is despatched, the leaf falls. The circuit of the\nwaters is mere falling. The walking of man and all animals\nis a falling forward. All our manual labor and works of\nstrength, as prying, splitting, digging, rowing and so\nforth, are done by dint of continual falling, and the\nglobe, earth, moon, comet, sun, star, fall for ever and ever.",
        "The simplicity of the universe is very different from\nthe simplicity of a machine. He who sees moral nature\nout and out and thoroughly knows how knowledge is acquired\nand character formed, is a pedant.  The simplicity of nature\nis not that which may easily be read, but is inexhaustible.\nThe last analysis can no wise be made. We judge of a man’s\nwisdom by his hope, knowing that the perception of the\ninexhaustibleness of nature is an immortal youth. The wild\nfertility of nature is felt in comparing our rigid names\nand reputations with our fluid consciousness. We pass in\nthe world for sects and schools, for erudition and piety,\nand we are all the time jejune babes. One sees very well\nhow Pyrrhonism grew up.  Every man sees that he is that\nmiddle point whereof every thing may be affirmed and denied\nwith equal reason. He is old, he is young, he is very wise,\nhe is altogether ignorant. He hears and feels what you say\nof the seraphim, and of the tin-peddler. There is no\npermanent wise man except in the figment of the Stoics. We\nside with the hero, as we read or paint, against the coward\nand the robber; but we have been ourselves that coward and\nrobber, and shall be again,—not in the low circumstance,\nbut in comparison with the grandeurs possible to the soul.",
        "A little consideration of what takes place around us\nevery day would show us that a higher law than that\nof our will regulates events; that our painful labors\nare unnecessary and fruitless; that only in our easy,\nsimple, spontaneous action are we strong, and by\ncontenting ourselves with obedience we become divine.\nBelief and love,—a believing love will relieve us of\na vast load of care. O my brothers, God exists. There\nis a soul at the centre of nature and over the will of\nevery man, so that none of us can wrong the universe.\nIt has so infused its strong enchantment into nature\nthat we prosper when we accept its advice, and when we\nstruggle to wound its creatures our hands are glued to\nour sides, or they beat our own breasts. The whole course\nof things goes to teach us faith. We need only obey.\nThere is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening\nwe shall hear the right word. Why need you choose so\npainfully your place and occupation and associates and\nmodes of action and of entertainment? Certainly there is\na possible right for you that precludes the need of\nbalance and wilful election. For you there is a reality,\na fit place and congenial duties. Place yourself in the\nmiddle of the stream of power and wisdom which animates\nall whom it floats, and you are without effort impelled\nto truth, to right and a perfect contentment. Then you\nput all gainsayers in the wrong. Then you are the world,\nthe measure of right, of truth, of beauty. If we will not\nbe mar-plots with our miserable interferences, the work,\nthe society, letters, arts, science, religion of men would\ngo on far better than now, and the heaven predicted from\nthe beginning of the world, and still predicted from the\nbottom of the heart, would organize itself, as do now the\nrose and the air and the sun.",
        "I say, do not choose; but that is a figure of speech\nby which I would distinguish what is commonly called\nchoice among men, and which is a partial act, the\nchoice of the hands, of the eyes, of the appetites,\nand not a whole act of the man. But that which I call\nright or goodness, is the choice of my constitution;\nand that which I call heaven, and inwardly aspire after,\nis the state or circumstance desirable to my constitution;\nand the action which I in all my years tend to do, is the\nwork for my faculties. We must hold a man amenable to\nreason for the choice of his daily craft or profession.\nIt is not an excuse any longer for his deeds that they\nare the custom of his trade. What business has he with\nan evil trade?  Has he not a calling in his character?",
        "Each man has his own vocation. The talent is the call.\nThere is one direction in which all space is open to\nhim. He has faculties silently inviting him thither\nto endless exertion. He is like a ship in a river; he\nruns against obstructions on every side but one, on\nthat side all obstruction is taken away and he sweeps\nserenely over a deepening channel into an infinite sea.\nThis talent and this call depend on his organization,\nor the mode in which the general soul incarnates itself\nin him. He inclines to do something which is easy to him\nand good when it is done, but which no other man can do.\nHe has no rival. For the more truly he consults his own\npowers, the more difference will his work exhibit from\nthe work of any other. His ambition is exactly proportioned\nto his powers. The height of the pinnacle is determined by\nthe breadth of the base. Every man has this call of the\npower to do somewhat unique, and no man has any other call.\nThe pretence that he has another call, a summons by name\nand personal election and outward “signs that mark him\nextraordinary, and not in the roll of common men,” is\nfanaticism, and betrays obtuseness to perceive that there\nis one mind in all the individuals, and no respect of\npersons therein.",
        "By doing his work he makes the need felt which he can\nsupply, and creates the taste by which he is enjoyed.\nBy doing his own work he unfolds himself. It is the\nvice of our public speaking that it has not abandonment.\nSomewhere, not only every orator but every man should\nlet out all the length of all the reins; should find or\nmake a frank and hearty expression of what force and\nmeaning is in him. The common experience is that the\nman fits himself as well as he can to the customary\ndetails of that work or trade he falls into, and tends\nit as a dog turns a spit. Then is he a part of the\nmachine he moves; the man is lost. Until he can manage\nto communicate himself to others in his full stature\nand proportion, he does not yet find his vocation. He\nmust find in that an outlet for his character, so that\nhe may justify his work to their eyes. If the labor is\nmean, let him by his thinking and character make it\nliberal. Whatever he knows and thinks, whatever in his\napprehension is worth doing, that let him communicate,\nor men will never know and honor him aright. Foolish,\nwhenever you take the meanness and formality of that\nthing you do, instead of converting it into the obedient\nspiracle of your character and aims.",
        "We like only such actions as have already long had the\npraise of men, and do not perceive that any thing man\ncan do may be divinely done. We think greatness entailed\nor organized in some places or duties, in certain offices\nor occasions, and do not see that Paganini can extract\nrapture from a catgut, and Eulenstein from a jews-harp,\nand a nimble-fingered lad out of shreds of paper with his\nscissors, and Landseer out of swine, and the hero out of\nthe pitiful habitation and company in which he was hidden.\nWhat we call obscure condition or vulgar society is that\ncondition and society whose poetry is not yet written, but\nwhich you shall presently make as enviable and renowned as\nany. In our estimates let us take a lesson from kings. The\nparts of hospitality, the connection of families, the\nimpressiveness of death, and a thousand other things,\nroyalty makes its own estimate of, and a royal mind will.\nTo make habitually a new estimate,—that is elevation.",
        "What a man does, that he has. What has he to do with\nhope or fear? In himself is his might. Let him regard\nno good as solid but that which is in his nature and\nwhich must grow out of him as long as he exists. The\ngoods of fortune may come and go like summer leaves;\nlet him scatter them on every wind as the momentary\nsigns of his infinite productiveness.",
        "He may have his own. A man’s genius, the quality that\ndifferences him from every other, the susceptibility\nto one class of influences, the selection of what is\nfit for him, the rejection of what is unfit, determines\nfor him the character of the universe. A man is a method,\na progressive arrangement; a selecting principle,\ngathering his like to him wherever he goes. He takes only\nhis own out of the multiplicity that sweeps and circles\nround him. He is like one of those booms which are set\nout from the shore on rivers to catch drift-wood, or like\nthe loadstone amongst splinters of steel. Those facts,\nwords, persons, which dwell in his memory without his\nbeing able to say why, remain because they have a relation\nto him not less real for being as yet unapprehended. They\nare symbols of value to him as they can interpret parts\nof his consciousness which he would vainly seek words for\nin the conventional images of books and other minds. What\nattracts my attention shall have it, as I will go to the\nman who knocks at my door, whilst a thousand persons as\nworthy go by it, to whom I give no regard. It is enough\nthat these particulars speak to me. A few anecdotes, a\nfew traits of character, manners, face, a few incidents,\nhave an emphasis in your memory out of all proportion to\ntheir apparent significance if you measure them by the\nordinary standards. They relate to your gift. Let them\nhave their weight, and do not reject them and cast about\nfor illustration and facts more usual in literature. What\nyour heart thinks great is great. The soul’s emphasis is\nalways right.",
        "Over all things that are agreeable to his nature and\ngenius the man has the highest right. Everywhere he\nmay take what belongs to his spiritual estate, nor can\nhe take any thing else though all doors were open, nor\ncan all the force of men hinder him from taking so much.\nIt is vain to attempt to keep a secret from one who has\na right to know it. It will tell itself. That mood into\nwhich a friend can bring us is his dominion over us. To\nthe thoughts of that state of mind he has a right. All\nthe secrets of that state of mind he can compel. This is\na law which statesmen use in practice. All the terrors\nof the French Republic, which held Austria in awe, were\nunable to command her diplomacy. But Napoleon sent to\nVienna M. de Narbonne, one of the old noblesse, with the\nmorals, manners and name of that interest, saying that it\nwas indispensable to send to the old aristocracy of Europe\nmen of the same connection, which, in fact, constitutes a\nsort of free-masonry. M. de Narbonne in less than a\nfortnight penetrated all the secrets of the imperial\ncabinet.",
        "Nothing seems so easy as to speak and to be understood.\nYet a man may come to find that the strongest of defences\nand of ties,—that he has been understood; and he who\nhas received an opinion may come to find it the most\ninconvenient of bonds.",
        "If a teacher have any opinion which he wishes to conceal,\nhis pupils will become as fully indoctrinated into that\nas into any which he publishes. If you pour water into\na vessel twisted into coils and angles, it is vain to\nsay, I will pour it only into this or that;—it will find\nits level in all. Men feel and act the consequences of\nyour doctrine without being able to show how they follow.\nShow us an arc of the curve, and a good mathematician will\nfind out the whole figure. We are always reasoning from\nthe seen to the unseen. Hence the perfect intelligence\nthat subsists between wise men of remote ages. A man\ncannot bury his meanings so deep in his book but time and\nlike-minded men will find them. Plato had a secret doctrine,\nhad he? What secret can he conceal from the eyes of Bacon?\nof Montaigne? of Kant? Therefore, Aristotle said of his\nworks, “They are published and not published.”",
        "No man can learn what he has not preparation for learning,\nhowever near to his eyes is the object. A chemist may\ntell his most precious secrets to a carpenter, and he\nshall be never the wiser,—the secrets he would not utter\nto a chemist for an estate. God screens us evermore from\npremature ideas. Our eyes are holden that we cannot see\nthings that stare us in the face, until the hour arrives\nwhen the mind is ripened; then we behold them, and the\ntime when we saw them not is like a dream.",
        "Not in nature but in man is all the beauty and worth\nhe sees. The world is very empty, and is indebted to\nthis gilding, exalting soul for all its pride. “Earth\nfills her lap with splendors” not her own. The vale of\nTempe, Tivoli and Rome are earth and water, rocks and\nsky. There are as good earth and water in a thousand\nplaces, yet how unaffecting!",
        "People are not the better for the sun and moon, the\nhorizon and the trees; as it is not observed that the\nkeepers of Roman galleries or the valets of painters\nhave any elevation of thought, or that librarians are\nwiser men than others. There are graces in the demeanor\nof a polished and noble person which are lost upon the\neye of a churl. These are like the stars whose light has\nnot yet reached us.",
        "He may see what he maketh. Our dreams are the sequel of\nour waking knowledge. The visions of the night bear some\nproportion to the visions of the day. Hideous dreams are\nexaggerations of the sins of the day. We see our evil\naffections embodied in bad physiognomies. On the Alps\nthe traveller sometimes beholds his own shadow magnified\nto a giant, so that every gesture of his hand is terrific.\n\"My children,” said an old man to his boys scared by a\nfigure in the dark entry, “my children, you will never\nsee any thing worse than yourselves.” As in dreams, so in\nthe scarcely less fluid events of the world every man sees\nhimself in colossal, without knowing that it is himself.\nThe good, compared to the evil which he sees, is as his\nown good to his own evil. Every quality of his mind is\nmagnified in some one acquaintance, and every emotion of\nhis heart in some one. He is like a quincunx of trees,\nwhich counts five,—east, west, north, or south; or an\ninitial, medial, and terminal acrostic. And why not? He\ncleaves to one person and avoids another, according to\ntheir likeness or unlikeness to himself, truly seeking\nhimself in his associates and moreover in his trade and\nhabits and gestures and meats and drinks, and comes at\nlast to be faithfully represented by every view you take\nof his circumstances.",
        "He may read what he writes. What can we see or acquire\nbut what we are? You have observed a skilful man reading\nVirgil. Well, that author is a thousand books to a\nthousand persons. Take the book into your two hands and\nread your eyes out, you will never find what I find. If\nany ingenious reader would have a monopoly of the wisdom\nor delight he gets, he is as secure now the book is\nEnglished, as if it were imprisoned in the Pelews’ tongue.\nIt is with a good book as it is with good company. Introduce\na base person among gentlemen, it is all to no purpose; he\nis not their fellow. Every society protects itself. The\ncompany is perfectly safe, and he is not one of them,\nthough his body is in the room.",
        "What avails it to fight with the eternal laws of mind,\nwhich adjust the relation of all persons to each other\nby the mathematical measure of their havings and beings?\nGertrude is enamored of Guy; how high, how aristocratic,\nhow Roman his mien and manners! to live with him were\nlife indeed, and no purchase is too great; and heaven and\nearth are moved to that end. Well, Gertrude has Guy; but\nwhat now avails how high, how aristocratic, how Roman his\nmien and manners, if his heart and aims are in the senate,\nin the theatre and in the billiard-room, and she has no\naims, no conversation that can enchant her graceful lord?",
        "He shall have his own society. We can love nothing but\nnature. The most wonderful talents, the most meritorious\nexertions really avail very little with us; but nearness\nor likeness of nature,—how beautiful is the ease of its\nvictory! Persons approach us, famous for their beauty,\nfor their accomplishments, worthy of all wonder for their\ncharms and gifts; they dedicate their whole skill to the\nhour and the company,—with very imperfect result. To be\nsure it would be ungrateful in us not to praise them\nloudly. Then, when all is done, a person of related mind,\na brother or sister by nature, comes to us so softly and\neasily, so nearly and intimately, as if it were the blood\nin our proper veins, that we feel as if some one was gone,\ninstead of another having come; we are utterly relieved\nand refreshed; it is a sort of joyful solitude. We foolishly\nthink in our days of sin that we must court friends by\ncompliance to the customs of society, to its dress, its\nbreeding, and its estimates. But only that soul can be my\nfriend which I encounter on the line of my own march, that\nsoul to which I do not decline and which does not decline\nto me, but, native of the same celestial latitude, repeats\nin its own all my experience. The scholar forgets himself\nand apes the customs and costumes of the man of the world\nto deserve the smile of beauty, and follows some giddy\ngirl, not yet taught by religious passion to know the noble\nwoman with all that is serene, oracular and beautiful in her\nsoul. Let him be great, and love shall follow him. Nothing\nis more deeply punished than the neglect of the affinities\nby which alone society should be formed, and the insane\nlevity of choosing associates by others’ eyes.",
        "He may set his own rate. It is a maxim worthy of all\nacceptation that a man may have that allowance he takes.\nTake the place and attitude which belong to you, and all\nmen acquiesce. The world must be just. It leaves every\nman, with profound unconcern, to set his own rate. Hero\nor driveller, it meddles not in the matter. It will\ncertainly accept your own measure of your doing and being,\nwhether you sneak about and deny your own name, or whether\nyou see your work produced to the concave sphere of the\nheavens, one with the revolution of the stars.",
        "The same reality pervades all teaching. The man may\nteach by doing, and not otherwise. If he can communicate\nhimself he can teach, but not by words. He teaches who\ngives, and he learns who receives. There is no teaching\nuntil the pupil is brought into the same state or\nprinciple in which you are; a transfusion takes place;\nhe is you and you are he; then is a teaching, and by no\nunfriendly chance or bad company can he ever quite lose\nthe benefit. But your propositions run out of one ear\nas they ran in at the other. We see it advertised that\nMr. Grand will deliver an oration on the Fourth of July,\nand Mr. Hand before the Mechanics’ Association, and we\ndo not go thither, because we know that these gentlemen\nwill not communicate their own character and experience\nto the company. If we had reason to expect such a\nconfidence we should go through all inconvenience and\nopposition. The sick would be carried in litters.  But\na public oration is an escapade, a non-committal, an\napology, a gag, and not a communication, not a speech,\nnot a man.",
        "A like Nemesis presides over all intellectual works. We\nhave yet to learn that the thing uttered in words is\nnot therefore affirmed. It must affirm itself, or no\nforms of logic or of oath can give it evidence. The\nsentence must also contain its own apology for being\nspoken.",
        "The effect of any writing on the public mind is\nmathematically measurable by its depth of thought. How\nmuch water does it draw? If it awaken you to think, if\nit lift you from your feet with the great voice of\neloquence, then the effect is to be wide, slow, permanent,\nover the minds of men; if the pages instruct you not,\nthey will die like flies in the hour. The way to speak\nand write what shall not go out of fashion is to speak\nand write sincerely. The argument which has not power\nto reach my own practice, I may well doubt will fail\nto reach yours. But take Sidney’s maxim:—\"Look in thy\nheart, and write.” He that writes to himself writes to\nan eternal public. That statement only is fit to be made\npublic which you have come at in attempting to satisfy\nyour own curiosity. The writer who takes his subject from\nhis ear and not from his heart, should know that he has\nlost as much as he seems to have gained, and when the\nempty book has gathered all its praise, and half the\npeople say, ’What poetry! what genius!’ it still needs\nfuel to make fire. That only profits which is profitable.\nLife alone can impart life; and though we should burst we\ncan only be valued as we make ourselves valuable. There\nis no luck in literary reputation. They who make up the\nfinal verdict upon every book are not the partial and\nnoisy readers of the hour when it appears, but a court as\nof angels, a public not to be bribed, not to be entreated\nand not to be overawed, decides upon every man’s title to\nfame. Only those books come down which deserve to last.\nGilt edges, vellum and morocco, and presentation-copies\nto all the libraries will not preserve a book in circulation\nbeyond its intrinsic date. It must go with all Walpole’s\nNoble and Royal Authors to its fate. Blackmore, Kotzebue,\nor Pollok may endure for a night, but Moses and Homer stand\nfor ever. There are not in the world at any one time more\nthan a dozen persons who read and understand Plato,—never\nenough to pay for an edition of his works; yet to every\ngeneration these come duly down, for the sake of those few\npersons, as if God brought them in his hand. “No book,” said\nBentley, “was ever written down by any but itself.” The\npermanence of all books is fixed by no effort, friendly or\nhostile, but by their own specific gravity, or the intrinsic\nimportance of their contents to the constant mind of man.\n\"Do not trouble yourself too much about the light on your\nstatue,” said Michael Angelo to the young sculptor; “the\nlight of the public square will test its value.”",
        "In like manner the effect of every action is measured\nby the depth of the sentiment from which it proceeds.\nThe great man knew not that he was great. It took a\ncentury or two for that fact to appear.  What he did,\nhe did because he must; it was the most natural thing\nin the world, and grew out of the circumstances of the\nmoment. But now, every thing he did, even to the lifting\nof his finger or the eating of bread, looks large, all-\nrelated, and is called an institution.",
        "These are the demonstrations in a few particulars of\nthe genius of nature; they show the direction of the\nstream. But the stream is blood; every drop is alive.\nTruth has not single victories; all things are its\norgans,—not only dust and stones, but errors and lies.\nThe laws of disease, physicians say, are as beautiful\nas the laws of health. Our philosophy is affirmative\nand readily accepts the testimony of negative facts, as\nevery shadow points to the sun. By a divine necessity\nevery fact in nature is constrained to offer its testimony.",
        "Human character evermore publishes itself. The most\nfugitive deed and word, the mere air of doing a thing,\nthe intimated purpose, expresses character. If you act\nyou show character; if you sit still, if you sleep, you\nshow it. You think because you have spoken nothing when\nothers spoke, and have given no opinion on the times,\non the church, on slavery, on marriage, on socialism,\non secret societies, on the college, on parties and\npersons, that your verdict is still expected with\ncuriosity as a reserved wisdom.  Far otherwise; your\nsilence answers very loud. You have no oracle to utter,\nand your fellow-men have learned that you cannot help\nthem; for oracles speak. Doth not Wisdom cry and\nUnderstanding put forth her voice?",
        "Dreadful limits are set in nature to the powers of\ndissimulation. Truth tyrannizes over the unwilling\nmembers of the body. Faces never lie, it is said. No\nman need be deceived who will study the changes of\nexpression. When a man speaks the truth in the spirit\nof truth, his eye is as clear as the heavens. When he\nhas base ends and speaks falsely, the eye is muddy and\nsometimes asquint.",
        "I have heard an experienced counsellor say that he\nnever feared the effect upon a jury of a lawyer who\ndoes not believe in his heart that his client ought\nto have a verdict. If he does not believe it his\nunbelief will appear to the jury, despite all his\nprotestations, and will become their unbelief. This\nis that law whereby a work of art, of whatever kind,\nsets us in the same state of mind wherein the artist\nwas when he made it. That which we do not believe we\ncannot adequately say, though we may repeat the words\nnever so often. It was this conviction which Swedenborg\nexpressed when he described a group of persons in the\nspiritual world endeavoring in vain to articulate a\nproposition which they did not believe; but they could\nnot, though they twisted and folded their lips even to\nindignation.",
        "A man passes for that he is worth. Very idle is all\ncuriosity concerning other people’s estimate of us,\nand all fear of remaining unknown is not less so. If\na man know that he can do any thing,—that he can do\nit better than any one else,—he has a pledge of the\nacknowledgment of that fact by all persons. The world\nis full of judgment-days, and into every assembly that\na man enters, in every action he attempts, he is gauged\nand stamped. In every troop of boys that whoop and run\nin each yard and square, a new-comer is as well and\naccurately weighed in the course of a few days and\nstamped with his right number, as if he had undergone\na formal trial of his strength, speed and temper. A\nstranger comes from a distant school, with better dress,\nwith trinkets in his pockets, with airs and pretensions;\nan older boy says to himself, ’It’s of no use; we shall\nfind him out to-morrow.’ ’What has he done?’ is the divine\nquestion which searches men and transpierces every false\nreputation. A fop may sit in any chair of the world nor\nbe distinguished for his hour from Homer and Washington;\nbut there need never be any doubt concerning the respective\nability of human beings. Pretension may sit still, but\ncannot act. Pretension never feigned an act of real\ngreatness. Pretension never wrote an Iliad, nor drove back\nXerxes, nor christianized the world, nor abolished slavery.",
        "As much virtue as there is, so much appears; as much\ngoodness as there is, so much reverence it commands.\nAll the devils respect virtue. The high, the generous,\nthe self-devoted sect will always instruct and command\nmankind. Never was a sincere word utterly lost. Never a\nmagnanimity fell to the ground, but there is some heart\nto greet and accept it unexpectedly. A man passes for\nthat he is worth.  What he is engraves itself on his face,\non his form, on his fortunes, in letters of light.\nConcealment avails him nothing, boasting nothing. There\nis confession in the glances of our eyes, in our smiles,\nin salutations, and the grasp of hands. His sin bedaubs\nhim, mars all his good impression. Men know not why they\ndo not trust him, but they do not trust him. His vice\nglasses his eye, cuts lines of mean expression in his\ncheek, pinches the nose, sets the mark of the beast on\nthe back of the head, and writes O fool! fool! on the\nforehead of a king.",
        "If you would not be known to do any thing, never do it.\nA man may play the fool in the drifts of a desert, but\nevery grain of sand shall seem to see. He may be a\nsolitary eater, but he cannot keep his foolish counsel.\nA broken complexion, a swinish look, ungenerous acts\nand the want of due knowledge,—all blab. Can a cook, a\nChiffinch, an Iachimo be mistaken for Zeno or Paul?\nConfucius exclaimed,—\"How can a man be concealed? How\ncan a man be concealed?”",
        "On the other hand, the hero fears not that if he\nwithhold the avowal of a just and brave act it will\ngo unwitnessed and unloved. One knows it,—himself,\n—and is pledged by it to sweetness of peace and to\nnobleness of aim which will prove in the end a better\nproclamation of it than the relating of the incident.\nVirtue is the adherence in action to the nature of\nthings, and the nature of things makes it prevalent.\nIt consists in a perpetual substitution of being for\nseeming, and with sublime propriety God is described\nas saying, I AM.",
        "The lesson which these observations convey is, Be, and\nnot seem. Let us acquiesce. Let us take our bloated\nnothingness out of the path of the divine circuits. Let\nus unlearn our wisdom of the world. Let us lie low in\nthe Lord’s power and learn that truth alone makes rich\nand great.",

Common men are\napologies for men; they bow the head, excuse themselves\nwith prolix reasons, and accumulate appearances because\nthe substance is not.",
        "We are full of these superstitions of sense, the worship\nof magnitude. We call the poet inactive, because he is\nnot a president, a merchant, or a porter. We adore an\ninstitution, and do not see that it is founded on a\nthought which we have. But real action is in silent\nmoments. The epochs of our life are not in the visible\nfacts of our choice of a calling, our marriage, our\nacquisition of an office, and the like, but in a silent\nthought by the way-side as we walk; in a thought which\nrevises our entire manner of life and says,—’Thus hast\nthou done, but it were better thus.’ And all our after\nyears, like menials, serve and wait on this, and according\nto their ability execute its will. This revisal or\ncorrection is a constant force, which, as a tendency,\nreaches through our lifetime. The object of the man, the\naim of these moments, is to make daylight shine through\nhim, to suffer the law to traverse his whole being without\nobstruction, so that on what point soever of his doing your\neye falls it shall report truly of his character, whether\nit be his diet, his house, his religious forms, his society,\nhis mirth, his vote, his opposition. Now he is not homogeneous,\nbut heterogeneous, and the ray does not traverse; there are\nno thorough lights, but the eye of the beholder is puzzled,\ndetecting many unlike tendencies and a life not yet at one.",
        "Why should we make it a point with our false modesty\nto disparage that man we are and that form of being\nassigned to us? A good man is contented. I love and\nhonor Epaminondas, but I do not wish to be Epaminondas.\nI hold it more just to love the world of this hour than\nthe world of his hour. Nor can you, if I am true, excite\nme to the least uneasiness by saying, ’He acted and thou\nsittest still.’ I see action to be good, when the need\nis, and sitting still to be also good. Epaminondas, if\nhe was the man I take him for, would have sat still with\njoy and peace, if his lot had been mine. Heaven is large,\nand affords space for all modes of love and fortitude.\nWhy should we be busybodies and superserviceable? Action\nand inaction are alike to the true. One piece of the tree\nis cut for a weathercock and one for the sleeper of a\nbridge; the virtue of the wood is apparent in both.",

Besides,\nwithout any reasoning on the matter, I have no discontent.\nThe good soul nourishes me and unlocks new magazines of\npower and enjoyment to me every day.

        "Besides, why should we be cowed by the name of Action?\n’Tis a trick of the senses,—no more. We know that the\nancestor of every action is a thought.

Let us seek one peace\nby fidelity. Let me heed my duties. Why need I go gadding\ninto the scenes and philosophy of Greek and Italian\nhistory before I have justified myself to my benefactors?\nHow dare I read Washington’s campaigns when I have not\nanswered the letters of my own correspondents? Is not\nthat a just objection to much of our reading? It is a\npusillanimous desertion of our work to gaze after our\nneighbors. It is peeping. Byron says of Jack Bunting,—",
        "I may say it of our preposterous use of books,—He knew\nnot what to do, and so he read. I can think of nothing\nto fill my time with, and I find the Life of Brant. It\nis a very extravagant compliment to pay to Brant, or to\nGeneral Schuyler, or to General Washington. My time\nshould be as good as their time,—my facts, my net of\nrelations, as good as theirs, or either of theirs. Rather\nlet me do my work so well that other idlers if they choose\nmay compare my texture with the texture of these and find\nit identical with the best.",
        "This over-estimate of the possibilities of Paul and\nPericles, this under-estimate of our own, comes from a\nneglect of the fact of an identical nature. Bonaparte\nknew but one merit, and rewarded in one and the same\nway the good soldier, the good astronomer, the good\npoet, the good player. The poet uses the names of Caesar,\nof Tamerlane, of Bonduca, of Belisarius; the painter uses\nthe conventional story of the Virgin Mary, of Paul, of\nPeter. He does not therefore defer to the nature of these\naccidental men, of these stock heroes. If the poet write\na true drama, then he is Caesar, and not the player of\nCaesar; then the selfsame strain of thought, emotion as\npure, wit as subtle, motions as swift, mounting, extravagant,\nand a heart as great, self-sufficing, dauntless, which on\nthe waves of its love and hope can uplift all that is\nreckoned solid and precious in the world,—palaces, gardens,\nmoney, navies, kingdoms,—marking its own incomparable worth\nby the slight it casts on these gauds of men;—these all are\nhis, and by the power of these he rouses the nations. Let a\nman believe in God, and not in names and places and persons.\nLet the great soul incarnated in some woman’s form, poor and\nsad and single, in some Dolly or Joan, go out to service,\nand sweep chambers and scour floors, and its effulgent\ndaybeams cannot be muffled or hid, but to sweep and scour\nwill instantly appear supreme and beautiful actions, the top\nand radiance of human life, and all people will get mops and\nbrooms; until, lo! suddenly the great soul has enshrined\nitself in some other form and done some other deed, and that\nis now the flower and head of all living nature.",

        "Every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments;\neach of its joys ripens into a new want. Nature,\nuncontainable, flowing, forelooking, in the first\nsentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence\nwhich shall lose all particular regards in its general\nlight. The introduction to this felicity is in a private\nand tender relation of one to one, which is the enchantment\nof human life; which, like a certain divine rage and\nenthusiasm, seizes on man at one period and works a\nrevolution in his mind and body; unites him to his race,\npledges him to the domestic and civic relations, carries\nhim with new sympathy into nature, enhances the power of\nthe senses, opens the imagination, adds to his character\nheroic and sacred attributes, establishes marriage, and\ngives permanence to human society.",
        "The natural association of the sentiment of love with\nthe heyday of the blood seems to require that in order\nto portray it in vivid tints, which every youth and maid\nshould confess to be true to their throbbing experience,\none must not be too old. The delicious fancies of youth\nreject the least savor of a mature philosophy, as chilling\nwith age and pedantry their purple bloom. And therefore I\nknow I incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and\nstoicism from those who compose the Court and Parliament\nof Love. But from these formidable censors I shall appeal\nto my seniors. For it is to be considered that this passion\nof which we speak, though it begin with the young, yet\nforsakes not the old, or rather suffers no one who is truly\nits servant to grow old, but makes the aged participators\nof it not less than the tender maiden, though in a different\nand nobler sort. For it is a fire that kindling its first\nembers in the narrow nook of a private bosom, caught from\na wandering spark out of another private heart, glows and\nenlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men\nand women, upon the universal heart of all, and so lights\nup the whole world and all nature with its generous flames.\nIt matters not therefore whether we attempt to describe\nthe passion at twenty, at thirty, or at eighty years. He\nwho paints it at the first period will lose some of its\nlater, he who paints it at the last, some of its earlier\ntraits. Only it is to be hoped that by patience and the\nMuses’ aid we may attain to that inward view of the law\nwhich shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful, so\ncentral that it shall commend itself to the eye, at whatever\nangle beholden.",
        "And the first condition is, that we must leave a too\nclose and lingering adherence to facts, and study the\nsentiment as it appeared in hope and not in history.\nFor each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured,\nas the life of man is not, to his imagination. Each man\nsees over his own experience a certain stain of error,\nwhilst that of other men looks fair and ideal. Let any\nman go back to those delicious relations which make the\nbeauty of his life, which have given him sincerest\ninstruction and nourishment, he will shrink and moan.\nAlas! I know not why, but infinite compunctions embitter\nin mature life the remembrances of budding joy and cover\nevery beloved name. Every thing is beautiful seen from the\npoint of the intellect, or as truth. But all is sour, if\nseen as experience. Details are melancholy; the plan is\nseemly and noble. In the actual world—the painful kingdom\nof time and place—dwell care, and canker, and fear. With\nthought, with the ideal, is immortal hilarity, the rose of\njoy. Round it all the Muses sing.  But grief cleaves to\nnames, and persons, and the partial interests of to-day\nand yesterday.",
        "The strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion\nwhich this topic of personal relations usurps in the\nconversation of society. What do we wish to know of\nany worthy person so much, as how he has sped in the\nhistory of this sentiment? What books in the circulating\nlibraries circulate? How we glow over these novels of\npassion, when the story is told with any spark of truth\nand nature! And what fastens attention, in the intercourse\nof life, like any passage betraying affection between two\nparties? Perhaps we never saw them before, and never shall\nmeet them again. But we see them exchange a glance, or\nbetray a deep emotion, and we are no longer strangers. We\nunderstand them, and take the warmest interest in the\ndevelopment of the romance. All mankind love a lover. The\nearliest demonstrations of complacency and kindness are\nnature’s most winning pictures. It is the dawn of civility\nand grace in the coarse and rustic.  The rude village boy\nteases the girls about the school-house door;—but to-day\nhe comes running into the entry, and meets one fair child\ndisposing her satchel; he holds her books to help her, and\ninstantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from\nhim infinitely, and was a sacred precinct. Among the throng\nof girls he runs rudely enough, but one alone distances him;\nand these two little neighbors, that were so close just now,\nhave learned to respect each other’s personality. Or who can\navert his eyes from the engaging, half-artful, half-artless\nways of school-girls who go into the country shops to buy a\nskein of silk or a sheet of paper, and talk half an hour\nabout nothing with the broad-faced, good-natured shop-boy.\nIn the village they are on a perfect equality, which love\ndelights in, and without any coquetry the happy, affectionate\nnature of woman flows out in this pretty gossip. The girls\nmay have little beauty, yet plainly do they establish between\nthem and the good boy the most agreeable, confiding relations,\nwhat with their fun and their earnest, about Edgar and Jonas\nand Almira, and who was invited to the party, and who danced\nat the dancing-school, and when the singing-school would begin,\nand other nothings concerning which the parties cooed. By and\nby that boy wants a wife, and very truly and heartily will he\nknow where to find a sincere and sweet mate, without any risk\nsuch as Milton deplores as incident to scholars and great men.",
        "I have been told that in some public discourses of mine\nmy reverence for the intellect has made me unjustly cold\nto the personal relations. But now I almost shrink at the\nremembrance of such disparaging words. For persons are\nlove’s world, and the coldest philosopher cannot recount\nthe debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to\nthe power of love, without being tempted to unsay, as\ntreasonable to nature, aught derogatory to the social\ninstincts. For though the celestial rapture falling out\nof heaven seizes only upon those of tender age, and\nalthough a beauty overpowering all analysis or comparison\nand putting us quite beside ourselves we can seldom see\nafter thirty years, yet the remembrance of these visions\noutlasts all other remembrances, and is a wreath of flowers\non the oldest brows. But here is a strange fact; it may\nseem to many men, in revising their experience, that they\nhave no fairer page in their life’s book than the delicious\nmemory of some passages wherein affection contrived to give\na witchcraft, surpassing the deep attraction of its own\ntruth, to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances.\nIn looking backward they may find that several things which\nwere not the charm have more reality to this groping memory\nthan the charm itself which embalmed them. But be our\nexperience in particulars what it may, no man ever forgot\nthe visitations of that power to his heart and brain, which\ncreated all things anew; which was the dawn in him of music,\npoetry, and art; which made the face of nature radiant with\npurple light, the morning and the night varied enchantments;\nwhen a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound,\nand the most trivial circumstance associated with one form\nis put in the amber of memory; when he became all eye when\none was present, and all memory when one was gone; when the\nyouth becomes a watcher of windows and studious of a glove,\na veil, a ribbon, or the wheels of a carriage; when no place\nis too solitary and none too silent, for him who has richer\ncompany and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts than\nany old friends, though best and purest, can give him; for\nthe figures, the motions, the words of the beloved object\nare not like other images written in water, but, as Plutarch\nsaid, “enamelled in fire,” and make the study of midnight:—",
        "In the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at\nthe recollection of days when happiness was not happy\nenough, but must be drugged with the relish of pain and\nfear; for he touched the secret of the matter who said\nof love,—",
        "and when the day was not long enough, but the night too\nmust be consumed in keen recollections; when the head\nboiled all night on the pillow with the generous deed\nit resolved on; when the moonlight was a pleasing fever\nand the stars were letters and the flowers ciphers and\nthe air was coined into song; when all business seemed\nan impertinence, and all the men and women running to\nand fro in the streets, mere pictures.",
        "The passion rebuilds the world for the youth. It makes\nall things alive and significant. Nature grows conscious.\nEvery bird on the boughs of the tree sings now to his\nheart and soul. The notes are almost articulate. The\nclouds have faces as he looks on them. The trees of the\nforest, the waving grass and the peeping flowers have\ngrown intelligent; and he almost fears to trust them with\nthe secret which they seem to invite. Yet nature soothes\nand sympathizes. In the green solitude he finds a dearer\nhome than with men:—",
        "Behold there in the wood the fine madman! He is a\npalace of sweet sounds and sights; he dilates; he is\ntwice a man; he walks with arms akimbo; he soliloquizes;\nhe accosts the grass and the trees; he feels the blood\nof the violet, the clover and the lily in his veins; and\nhe talks with the brook that wets his foot.",
        "The heats that have opened his perceptions of natural\nbeauty have made him love music and verse. It is a\nfact often observed, that men have written good verses\nunder the inspiration of passion, who cannot write well\nunder any other circumstances.",
        "The like force has the passion over all his nature. It\nexpands the sentiment; it makes the clown gentle and\ngives the coward heart. Into the most pitiful and abject\nit will infuse a heart and courage to defy the world, so\nonly it have the countenance of the beloved object. In\ngiving him to another it still more gives him to himself.\nHe is a new man, with new perceptions, new and keener\npurposes, and a religious solemnity of character and aims.\nHe does not longer appertain to his family and society; he\nis somewhat; he is a person; he is a soul.",
        "And here let us examine a little nearer the nature of that\ninfluence which is thus potent over the human youth. Beauty,\nwhose revelation to man we now celebrate, welcome as the\nsun wherever it pleases to shine, which pleases everybody\nwith it and with themselves, seems sufficient to itself.\nThe lover cannot paint his maiden to his fancy poor and\nsolitary. Like a tree in flower, so much soft, budding,\ninforming loveliness is society for itself; and she teaches\nhis eye why Beauty was pictured with Loves and Graces\nattending her steps. Her existence makes the world rich.\nThough she extrudes all other persons from his attention\nas cheap and unworthy, she indemnifies him by carrying out\nher own being into somewhat impersonal, large, mundane, so\nthat the maiden stands to him for a representative of all\nselect things and virtues. For that reason the lover never\nsees personal resemblances in his mistress to her kindred\nor to others. His friends find in her a likeness to her\nmother, or her sisters, or to persons not of her blood. The\nlover sees no resemblance except to summer evenings and\ndiamond mornings, to rainbows and the song of birds.",
        "The ancients called beauty the flowering of virtue. Who\ncan analyze the nameless charm which glances from one\nand another face and form? We are touched with emotions\nof tenderness and complacency, but we cannot find whereat\nthis dainty emotion, this wandering gleam, points. It is\ndestroyed for the imagination by any attempt to refer it\nto organization. Nor does it point to any relations of\nfriendship or love known and described in society, but,\nas it seems to me, to a quite other and unattainable\nsphere, to relations of transcendent delicacy and sweetness,\nto what roses and violets hint and foreshow. We cannot\napproach beauty. Its nature is like opaline doves’-neck\nlustres, hovering and evanescent. Herein it resembles the\nmost excellent things, which all have this rainbow character,\ndefying all attempts at appropriation and use. What else\ndid Jean Paul Richter signify, when he said to music, “Away!\naway! thou speakest to me of things which in all my endless\nlife I have not found, and shall not find.” The same fluency\nmay be observed in every work of the plastic arts. The statue\nis then beautiful when it begins to be incomprehensible, when\nit is passing out of criticism and can no longer be defined\nby compass and measuring-wand, but demands an active\nimagination to go with it and to say what it is in the act of\ndoing. The god or hero of the sculptor is always represented\nin a transition from that which is representable to the senses,\nto that which is not. Then first it ceases to be a stone. The\nsame remark holds of painting. And of poetry the success is\nnot attained when it lulls and satisfies, but when it\nastonishes and fires us with new endeavors after the\nunattainable. Concerning it Landor inquires “whether it\nis not to be referred to some purer state of sensation and\nexistence.”",
        "In like manner, personal beauty is then first charming\nand itself when it dissatisfies us with any end; when\nit becomes a story without an end; when it suggests\ngleams and visions and not earthly satisfactions; when\nit makes the beholder feel his unworthiness; when he\ncannot feel his right to it, though he were Caesar; he\ncannot feel more right to it than to the firmament and\nthe splendors of a sunset.",
        "Hence arose the saying, “If I love you, what is that to\nyou?” We say so because we feel that what we love is not\nin your will, but above it. It is not you, but your\nradiance. It is that which you know not in yourself and\ncan never know.",
        "This agrees well with that high philosophy of Beauty\nwhich the ancient writers delighted in; for they said\nthat the soul of man, embodied here on earth, went\nroaming up and down in quest of that other world of\nits own out of which it came into this, but was soon\nstupefied by the light of the natural sun, and unable\nto see any other objects than those of this world,\nwhich are but shadows of real things. Therefore the\nDeity sends the glory of youth before the soul, that\nit may avail itself of beautiful bodies as aids to its\nrecollection of the celestial good and fair; and the\nman beholding such a person in the female sex runs to\nher and finds the highest joy in contemplating the form,\nmovement, and intelligence of this person, because it\nsuggests to him the presence of that which indeed is\nwithin the beauty, and the cause of the beauty.",
        "If however, from too much conversing with material\nobjects, the soul was gross, and misplaced its\nsatisfaction in the body, it reaped nothing but\nsorrow; body being unable to fulfil the promise\nwhich beauty holds out; but if, accepting the hint\nof these visions and suggestions which beauty makes\nto his mind, the soul passes through the body and\nfalls to admire strokes of character, and the lovers\ncontemplate one another in their discourses and their\nactions, then they pass to the true palace of beauty,\nmore and more inflame their love of it, and by this\nlove extinguishing the base affection, as the sun puts\nout the fire by shining on the hearth, they become pure\nand hallowed. By conversation with that which is in\nitself excellent, magnanimous, lowly, and just, the\nlover comes to a warmer love of these nobilities, and\na quicker apprehension of them. Then he passes from\nloving them in one to loving them in all, and so is\nthe one beautiful soul only the door through which he\nenters to the society of all true and pure souls. In\nthe particular society of his mate he attains a clearer\nsight of any spot, any taint which her beauty has\ncontracted from this world, and is able to point it out,\nand this with mutual joy that they are now able, without\noffence, to indicate blemishes and hindrances in each\nother, and give to each all help and comfort in curing\nthe same. And beholding in many souls the traits of the\ndivine beauty, and separating in each soul that which\nis divine from the taint which it has contracted in the\nworld, the lover ascends to the highest beauty, to the\nlove and knowledge of the Divinity, by steps on this\nladder of created souls.",
        "Somewhat like this have the truly wise told us of love\nin all ages. The doctrine is not old, nor is it new. If\nPlato, Plutarch and Apuleius taught it, so have Petrarch,\nAngelo and Milton. It awaits a truer unfolding in opposition\nand rebuke to that subterranean prudence which presides at\nmarriages with words that take hold of the upper world,\nwhilst one eye is prowling in the cellar; so that its gravest\ndiscourse has a savor of hams and powdering-tubs. Worst, when\nthis sensualism intrudes into the education of young women,\nand withers the hope and affection of human nature by\nteaching that marriage signifies nothing but a housewife’s\nthrift, and that woman’s life has no other aim.",
        "But this dream of love, though beautiful, is only one\nscene in our play. In the procession of the soul from\nwithin outward, it enlarges its circles ever, like the\npebble thrown into the pond, or the light proceeding\nfrom an orb. The rays of the soul alight first on things\nnearest, on every utensil and toy, on nurses and\ndomestics, on the house and yard and passengers, on the\ncircle of household acquaintance, on politics and geography\nand history. But things are ever grouping themselves\naccording to higher or more interior laws. Neighborhood,\nsize, numbers, habits, persons, lose by degrees their power\nover us. Cause and effect, real affinities, the longing for\nharmony between the soul and the circumstance, the progressive,\nidealizing instinct, predominate later, and the step backward\nfrom the higher to the lower relations is impossible. Thus\neven love, which is the deification of persons, must become\nmore impersonal every day. Of this at first it gives no hint.\nLittle think the youth and maiden who are glancing at each\nother across crowded rooms with eyes so full of mutual\nintelligence, of the precious fruit long hereafter to\nproceed from this new, quite external stimulus. The work\nof vegetation begins first in the irritability of the bark\nand leaf-buds. From exchanging glances, they advance to\nacts of courtesy, of gallantry, then to fiery passion, to\nplighting troth and marriage. Passion beholds its object as\na perfect unit. The soul is wholly embodied, and the body is\nwholly ensouled:—",
        "Romeo, if dead, should be cut up into little stars to\nmake the heavens fine. Life, with this pair, has no\nother aim, asks no more, than Juliet,—than Romeo.\nNight, day, studies, talents, kingdoms, religion, are\nall contained in this form full of soul, in this soul\nwhich is all form. The lovers delight in endearments,\nin avowals of love, in comparisons of their regards.\nWhen alone, they solace themselves with the remembered\nimage of the other. Does that other see the same star,\nthe same melting cloud, read the same book, feel the\nsame emotion, that now delight me? They try and weigh\ntheir affection, and adding up costly advantages, friends,\nopportunities, properties, exult in discovering that\nwillingly, joyfully, they would give all as a ransom for\nthe beautiful, the beloved head, not one hair of which\nshall be harmed. But the lot of humanity is on these\nchildren. Danger, sorrow, and pain arrive to them, as to\nall. Love prays. It makes covenants with Eternal Power\nin behalf of this dear mate. The union which is thus\neffected and which adds a new value to every atom in\nnature—for it transmutes every thread throughout the\nwhole web of relation into a golden ray, and bathes the\nsoul in a new and sweeter element—is yet a temporary\nstate. Not always can flowers, pearls, poetry,\nprotestations, nor even home in another heart, content\nthe awful soul that dwells in clay. It arouses itself\nat last from these endearments, as toys, and puts on\nthe harness and aspires to vast and universal aims. The\nsoul which is in the soul of each, craving a perfect\nbeatitude, detects incongruities, defects and\ndisproportion in the behavior of the other. Hence arise\nsurprise, expostulation and pain. Yet that which drew\nthem to each other was signs of loveliness, signs of\nvirtue; and these virtues are there, however eclipsed.\nThey appear and reappear and continue to attract; but\nthe regard changes, quits the sign and attaches to the\nsubstance. This repairs the wounded affection. Meantime,\nas life wears on, it proves a game of permutation and\ncombination of all possible positions of the parties,\nto employ all the resources of each and acquaint each\nwith the strength and weakness of the other. For it is\nthe nature and end of this relation, that they should\nrepresent the human race to each other. All that is in\nthe world, which is or ought to be known, is cunningly\nwrought into the texture of man, of woman:—",
        "The world rolls; the circumstances vary every hour. The\nangels that inhabit this temple of the body appear at\nthe windows, and the gnomes and vices also. By all the\nvirtues they are united. If there be virtue, all the\nvices are known as such; they confess and flee. Their\nonce flaming regard is sobered by time in either breast,\nand losing in violence what it gains in extent, it becomes\na thorough good understanding. They resign each other\nwithout complaint to the good offices which man and woman\nare severally appointed to discharge in time, and exchange\nthe passion which once could not lose sight of its object,\nfor a cheerful, disengaged furtherance, whether present or\nabsent, of each other’s designs. At last they discover that\nall which at first drew them together,—those once sacred\nfeatures, that magical play of charms,—was deciduous, had\na prospective end, like the scaffolding by which the house\nwas built; and the purification of the intellect and the\nheart from year to year is the real marriage, foreseen and\nprepared from the first, and wholly above their consciousness.\nLooking at these aims with which two persons, a man and a\nwoman, so variously and correlatively gifted, are shut up\nin one house to spend in the nuptial society forty or fifty\nyears, I do not wonder at the emphasis with which the heart\nprophesies this crisis from early infancy, at the profuse\nbeauty with which the instincts deck the nuptial bower, and\nnature and intellect and art emulate each other in the gifts\nand the melody they bring to the epithalamium.",
        "Thus are we put in training for a love which knows not\nsex, nor person, nor partiality, but which seeks virtue\nand wisdom everywhere, to the end of increasing virtue\nand wisdom. We are by nature observers, and thereby\nlearners. That is our permanent state. But we are often\nmade to feel that our affections are but tents of a night.\nThough slowly and with pain, the objects of the affections\nchange, as the objects of thought do. There are moments\nwhen the affections rule and absorb the man and make his\nhappiness dependent on a person or persons. But in health\nthe mind is presently seen again,—its overarching vault,\nbright with galaxies of immutable lights, and the warm\nloves and fears that swept over us as clouds must lose\ntheir finite character and blend with God, to attain their\nown perfection. But we need not fear that we can lose any\nthing by the progress of the soul. The soul may be trusted\nto the end. That which is so beautiful and attractive as\nthese relations, must be succeeded and supplanted only by\nwhat is more beautiful, and so on for ever.",
        "We have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken.\nMaugre all the selfishness that chills like east winds\nthe world, the whole human family is bathed with an\nelement of love like a fine ether. How many persons we\nmeet in houses, whom we scarcely speak to, whom yet we\nhonor, and who honor us! How many we see in the street,\nor sit with in church, whom, though silently, we warmly\nrejoice to be with! Read the language of these wandering\neye-beams. The heart knoweth.",
        "The effect of the indulgence of this human affection is\na certain cordial exhilaration. In poetry and in common\nspeech, the emotions of benevolence and complacency which\nare felt towards others are likened to the material\neffects of fire; so swift, or much more swift, more active,\nmore cheering, are these fine inward irradiations. From\nthe highest degree of passionate love to the lowest degree\nof good-will, they make the sweetness of life.",
        "Our intellectual and active powers increase with our\naffection. The scholar sits down to write, and all his\nyears of meditation do not furnish him with one good\nthought or happy expression; but it is necessary to\nwrite a letter to a friend,—and forthwith troops of\ngentle thoughts invest themselves, on every hand, with\nchosen words. See, in any house where virtue and self-\nrespect abide, the palpitation which the approach of\na stranger causes. A commended stranger is expected\nand announced, and an uneasiness betwixt pleasure and\npain invades all the hearts of a household. His arrival\nalmost brings fear to the good hearts that would welcome\nhim. The house is dusted, all things fly into their\nplaces, the old coat is exchanged for the new, and they\nmust get up a dinner if they can. Of a commended stranger,\nonly the good report is told by others, only the good and\nnew is heard by us. He stands to us for humanity. He is\nwhat we wish. Having imagined and invested him, we ask\nhow we should stand related in conversation and action\nwith such a man, and are uneasy with fear. The same idea\nexalts conversation with him. We talk better than we are\nwont. We have the nimblest fancy, a richer memory, and\nour dumb devil has taken leave for the time. For long\nhours we can continue a series of sincere, graceful,\nrich communications, drawn from the oldest, secretest\nexperience, so that they who sit by, of our own kinsfolk\nand acquaintance, shall feel a lively surprise at our\nunusual powers. But as soon as the stranger begins to\nintrude his partialities, his definitions, his defects,\ninto the conversation, it is all over. He has heard the\nfirst, the last and best he will ever hear from us. He\nis no stranger now. Vulgarity, ignorance, misapprehension\nare old acquaintances. Now, when he comes, he may get the\norder, the dress and the dinner,—but the throbbing of\nthe heart and the communications of the soul, no more.",
        "What is so pleasant as these jets of affection which\nmake a young world for me again? What so delicious\nas a just and firm encounter of two, in a thought, in\na feeling? How beautiful, on their approach to this\nbeating heart, the steps and forms of the gifted and\nthe true! The moment we indulge our affections, the\nearth is metamorphosed; there is no winter and no\nnight; all tragedies, all ennuis vanish,—all duties\neven; nothing fills the proceeding eternity but the\nforms all radiant of beloved persons. Let the soul be\nassured that somewhere in the universe it should rejoin\nits friend, and it would be content and cheerful alone\nfor a thousand years.",
        "I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my\nfriends, the old and the new. Shall I not call God\nthe Beautiful, who daily showeth himself so to me in\nhis gifts? I chide society, I embrace solitude, and\nyet I am not so ungrateful as not to see the wise, the\nlovely and the noble-minded, as from time to time they\npass my gate. Who hears me, who understands me, becomes\nmine,—a possession for all time. Nor is Nature so poor\nbut she gives me this joy several times, and thus we\nweave social threads of our own, a new web of relations;\nand, as many thoughts in succession substantiate themselves,\nwe shall by and by stand in a new world of our own creation,\nand no longer strangers and pilgrims in a traditionary globe.\nMy friends have come to me unsought. The great God gave them\nto me. By oldest right, by the divine affinity of virtue\nwith itself, I find them, or rather not I but the Deity\nin me and in them derides and cancels the thick walls of\nindividual character, relation, age, sex, circumstance, at\nwhich he usually connives, and now makes many one. High\nthanks I owe you, excellent lovers, who carry out the world\nfor me to new and noble depths, and enlarge the meaning of\nall my thoughts. These are new poetry of the first Bard,—\npoetry without stop,—hymn, ode and epic, poetry still\nflowing, Apollo and the Muses chanting still. Will these\ntoo separate themselves from me again, or some of them? I\nknow not, but I fear it not; for my relation to them is so\npure, that we hold by simple affinity, and the Genius of my\nlife being thus social, the same affinity will exert its\nenergy on whomsoever is as noble as these men and women,\nwherever I may be.",
        "I confess to an extreme tenderness of nature on this\npoint. It is almost dangerous to me to “crush the sweet\npoison of misused wine” of the affections. A new person\nis to me a great event and hinders me from sleep. I have\noften had fine fancies about persons which have given me\ndelicious hours; but the joy ends in the day; it yields\nno fruit. Thought is not born of it; my action is very\nlittle modified. I must feel pride in my friend’s\naccomplishments as if they were mine, and a property in\nhis virtues. I feel as warmly when he is praised, as the\nlover when he hears applause of his engaged maiden. We\nover-estimate the conscience of our friend. His goodness\nseems better than our goodness, his nature finer, his\ntemptations less. Every thing that is his,—his name,\nhis form, his dress, books and instruments,—fancy\nenhances. Our own thought sounds new and larger from\nhis mouth.",
        "Yet the systole and diastole of the heart are not\nwithout their analogy in the ebb and flow of love.\nFriendship, like the immortality of the soul, is too\ngood to be believed. The lover, beholding his maiden,\nhalf knows that she is not verily that which he\nworships; and in the golden hour of friendship we are\nsurprised with shades of suspicion and unbelief. We\ndoubt that we bestow on our hero the virtues in which\nhe shines, and afterwards worship the form to which we\nhave ascribed this divine inhabitation. In strictness,\nthe soul does not respect men as it respects itself.\nIn strict science all persons underlie the same\ncondition of an infinite remoteness. Shall we fear to\ncool our love by mining for the metaphysical foundation\nof this Elysian temple? Shall I not be as real as the\nthings I see? If I am, I shall not fear to know them\nfor what they are. Their essence is not less beautiful\nthan their appearance, though it needs finer organs\nfor its apprehension. The root of the plant is not\nunsightly to science, though for chaplets and festoons\nwe cut the stem short. And I must hazard the production\nof the bald fact amidst these pleasing reveries, though\nit should prove an Egyptian skull at our banquet. A man\nwho stands united with his thought conceives magnificently\nof himself. He is conscious of a universal success, even\nthough bought by uniform particular failures. No advantages,\nno powers, no gold or force, can be any match for\nhim. I cannot choose but rely on my own poverty more than\non your wealth. I cannot make your consciousness tantamount\nto mine. Only the star dazzles; the planet has a faint,\nmoon-like ray. I hear what you say of the admirable parts\nand tried temper of the party you praise, but I see well\nthat for all his purple cloaks I shall not like him,\nunless he is at last a poor Greek like me. I cannot deny\nit, O friend, that the vast shadow of the Phenomenal\nincludes thee also in its pied and painted immensity,—\nthee also, compared with whom all else is shadow. Thou\nart not Being, as Truth is, as Justice is,—thou art not\nmy soul, but a picture and effigy of that. Thou hast come\nto me lately, and already thou art seizing thy hat and\ncloak. Is it not that the soul puts forth friends as the\ntree puts forth leaves, and presently, by the germination\nof new buds, extrudes the old leaf? The law of nature is\nalternation for evermore. Each electrical state superinduces\nthe opposite. The soul environs itself with friends that it\nmay enter into a grander self-acquaintance or solitude; and\nit goes alone for a season, that it may exalt its conversation\nor society. This method betrays itself along the whole history\nof our personal relations. The instinct of affection revives\nthe hope of union with our mates, and the returning sense of\ninsulation recalls us from the chase. Thus every man passes\nhis life in the search after friendship, and if he should\nrecord his true sentiment, he might write a letter like this\nto each new candidate for his love:—",
        "Dear Friend,",
        "If I was sure of thee, sure of thy capacity, sure to match\nmy mood with thine, I should never think again of trifles\nin relation to thy comings and goings. I am not very wise;\nmy moods are quite attainable, and I respect thy genius;\nit is to me as yet unfathomed; yet dare I not presume in\nthee a perfect intelligence of me, and so thou art to me\na delicious torment. Thine ever, or never.",
        "Yet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity\nand not for life. They are not to be indulged.  This is to\nweave cobweb, and not cloth. Our friendships hurry to short\nand poor conclusions, because we have made them a texture\nof wine and dreams, instead of the tough fibre of the human\nheart. The laws of friendship are austere and eternal, of\none web with the laws of nature and of morals. But we have\naimed at a swift and petty benefit, to suck a sudden\nsweetness. We snatch at the slowest fruit in the whole garden\nof God, which many summers and many winters must ripen. We\nseek our friend not sacredly, but with an adulterate passion\nwhich would appropriate him to ourselves. In vain. We are\narmed all over with subtle antagonisms, which, as soon as\nwe meet, begin to play, and translate all poetry into stale\nprose. Almost all people descend to meet. All association\nmust be a compromise, and, what is worst, the very flower\nand aroma of the flower of each of the beautiful natures\ndisappears as they approach each other. What a perpetual\ndisappointment is actual society, even of the virtuous and\ngifted!  After interviews have been compassed with long\nforesight we must be tormented presently by baffled blows,\nby sudden, unseasonable apathies, by epilepsies of wit and\nof animal spirits, in the heyday of friendship and thought.\nOur faculties do not play us true, and both parties are\nrelieved by solitude.",
        "I ought to be equal to every relation. It makes no\ndifference how many friends I have and what content\nI can find in conversing with each, if there be one\nto whom I am not equal. If I have shrunk unequal from\none contest, the joy I find in all the rest becomes\nmean and cowardly. I should hate myself, if then I\nmade my other friends my asylum:—",
        "Our impatience is thus sharply rebuked. Bashfulness and\napathy are a tough husk in which a delicate organization\nis protected from premature ripening. It would be lost\nif it knew itself before any of the best souls were yet\nripe enough to know and own it. Respect the naturlangsamkeit\nwhich hardens the ruby in a million years, and works in\nduration in which Alps and Andes come and go as rainbows.\nThe good spirit of our life has no heaven which is the\nprice of rashness. Love, which is the essence of God, is\nnot for levity, but for the total worth of man. Let us not\nhave this childish luxury in our regards, but the austerest\nworth; let us approach our friend with an audacious trust\nin the truth of his heart, in the breadth, impossible to\nbe overturned, of his foundations.",
        "The attractions of this subject are not to be resisted,\nand I leave, for the time, all account of subordinate\nsocial benefit, to speak of that select and sacred\nrelation which is a kind of absolute, and which even\nleaves the language of love suspicious and common, so\nmuch is this purer, and nothing is so much divine.",
        "I do not wish to treat friendships daintily, but with\nroughest courage. When they are real, they are not\nglass threads or frostwork, but the solidest thing we\nknow. For now, after so many ages of experience, what\ndo we know of nature or of ourselves? Not one step has\nman taken toward the solution of the problem of his\ndestiny. In one condemnation of folly stand the whole\nuniverse of men. But the sweet sincerity of joy and\npeace which I draw from this alliance with my brother’s\nsoul is the nut itself whereof all nature and all thought\nis but the husk and shell. Happy is the house that\nshelters a friend! It might well be built, like a festal\nbower or arch, to entertain him a single day. Happier,\nif he know the solemnity of that relation and honor its\nlaw! He who offers himself a candidate for that covenant\ncomes up, like an Olympian, to the great games where the\nfirst-born of the world are the competitors. He proposes\nhimself for contests where Time, Want, Danger, are in\nthe lists, and he alone is victor who has truth enough\nin his constitution to preserve the delicacy of his\nbeauty from the wear and tear of all these.  The gifts\nof fortune may be present or absent, but all the speed\nin that contest depends on intrinsic nobleness and the\ncontempt of trifles. There are two elements that go to\nthe composition of friendship, each so sovereign that\nI can detect no superiority in either, no reason why\neither should be first named.  One is truth. A friend\nis a person with whom I may be sincere. Before him I\nmay think aloud. I am arrived at last in the presence\nof a man so real and equal that I may drop even those\nundermost garments of dissimulation, courtesy, and\nsecond thought, which men never put off, and may deal\nwith him with the simplicity and wholeness with which\none chemical atom meets another. Sincerity is the luxury\nallowed, like diadems and authority, only to the highest\nrank; that being permitted to speak truth, as having\nnone above it to court or conform unto. Every man alone\nis sincere. At the entrance of a second person, hypocrisy\nbegins. We parry and fend the approach of our fellow-man\nby compliments, by gossip, by amusements, by affairs. We\ncover up our thought from him under a hundred folds. I\nknew a man who under a certain religious frenzy cast off\nthis drapery, and omitting all compliment and commonplace,\nspoke to the conscience of every person he encountered,\nand that with great insight and beauty. At first he was\nresisted, and all men agreed he was mad. But persisting—\nas indeed he could not help doing—for some time in this\ncourse, he attained to the advantage of bringing every\nman of his acquaintance into true relations with him. No\nman would think of speaking falsely with him, or of\nputting him off with any chat of markets or reading-rooms.\nBut every man was constrained by so much sincerity to the\nlike plaindealing, and what love of nature, what poetry,\nwhat symbol of truth he had, he did certainly show him.\nBut to most of us society shows not its face and eye, but\nits side and its back. To stand in true relations with\nmen in a false age is worth a fit of insanity, is it not?\nWe can seldom go erect.  Almost every man we meet requires\nsome civility,—requires to be humored; he has some fame,\nsome talent, some whim of religion or philanthropy in his\nhead that is not to be questioned, and which spoils all\nconversation with him. But a friend is a sane man who\nexercises not my ingenuity, but me. My friend gives me\nentertainment without requiring any stipulation on my\npart. A friend therefore is a sort of paradox in nature.\nI who alone am, I who see nothing in nature whose\nexistence I can affirm with equal evidence to my own,\nbehold now the semblance of my being, in all its height,\nvariety, and curiosity, reiterated in a foreign form; so\nthat a friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of\nnature.",
        "The other element of friendship is tenderness. We are\nholden to men by every sort of tie, by blood, by pride,\nby fear, by hope, by lucre, by lust, by hate, by\nadmiration, by every circumstance and badge and trifle,\n—but we can scarce believe that so much character can\nsubsist in another as to draw us by love. Can another\nbe so blessed and we so pure that we can offer him\ntenderness? When a man becomes dear to me I have touched\nthe goal of fortune. I find very little written directly\nto the heart of this matter in books. And yet I have one\ntext which I cannot choose but remember. My author says,\n—\"I offer myself faintly and bluntly to those whose I\neffectually am, and tender myself least to him to whom I\nam the most devoted.” I wish that friendship should have\nfeet, as well as eyes and eloquence. It must plant itself\non the ground, before it vaults over the moon. I wish it\nto be a little of a citizen, before it is quite a cherub.\nWe chide the citizen because he makes love a commodity.\nIt is an exchange of gifts, of useful loans; it is good\nneighborhood; it watches with the sick; it holds the pall\nat the funeral; and quite loses sight of the delicacies\nand nobility of the relation. But though we cannot find\nthe god under this disguise of a sutler, yet on the other\nhand we cannot forgive the poet if he spins his thread\ntoo fine and does not substantiate his romance by the\nmunicipal virtues of justice, punctuality, fidelity and\npity. I hate the prostitution of the name of friendship\nto signify modish and worldly alliances. I much prefer\nthe company of ploughboys and tin-peddlers to the silken\nand perfumed amity which celebrates its days of encounter\nby a frivolous display, by rides in a curricle and dinners\nat the best taverns. The end of friendship is a commerce\nthe most strict and homely that can be joined; more strict\nthan any of which we have experience. It is for aid and\ncomfort through all the relations and passages of life\nand death. It is fit for serene days and graceful gifts\nand country rambles, but also for rough roads and hard\nfare, shipwreck, poverty, and persecution. It keeps company\nwith the sallies of the wit and the trances of religion. We\nare to dignify to each other the daily needs and offices of\nman’s life, and embellish it by courage, wisdom and unity.\nIt should never fall into something usual and settled, but\nshould be alert and inventive and add rhyme and reason to\nwhat was drudgery.",
        "Friendship may be said to require natures so rare and\ncostly, each so well tempered and so happily adapted,\nand withal so circumstanced (for even in that particular,\na poet says, love demands that the parties be altogether\npaired), that its satisfaction can very seldom be assured.\nIt cannot subsist in its perfection, say some of those\nwho are learned in this warm lore of the heart, betwixt\nmore than two. I am not quite so strict in my terms,\nperhaps because I have never known so high a fellowship\nas others. I please my imagination more with a circle of\ngodlike men and women variously related to each other and\nbetween whom subsists a lofty intelligence. But I find\nthis law of one to one peremptory for conversation, which\nis the practice and consummation of friendship. Do not\nmix waters too much. The best mix as ill as good and bad.\nYou shall have very useful and cheering discourse at\nseveral times with two several men, but let all three of\nyou come together and you shall not have one new and\nhearty word.  Two may talk and one may hear, but three\ncannot take part in a conversation of the most sincere\nand searching sort. In good company there is never such\ndiscourse between two, across the table, as takes place\nwhen you leave them alone. In good company the individuals\nmerge their egotism into a social soul exactly co-extensive\nwith the several consciousnesses there present. No\npartialities of friend to friend, no fondnesses of brother\nto sister, of wife to husband, are there pertinent, but\nquite otherwise. Only he may then speak who can sail on\nthe common thought of the party, and not poorly limited\nto his own. Now this convention, which good sense demands,\ndestroys the high freedom of great conversation, which\nrequires an absolute running of two souls into one.",
        "No two men but being left alone with each other enter\ninto simpler relations. Yet it is affinity that determines\nwhich two shall converse. Unrelated men give little joy\nto each other, will never suspect the latent powers of\neach. We talk sometimes of a great talent for conversation,\nas if it were a permanent property in some individuals.\nConversation is an evanescent relation,—no more. A man is\nreputed to have thought and eloquence; he cannot, for all\nthat, say a word to his cousin or his uncle. They accuse\nhis silence with as much reason as they would blame the\ninsignificance of a dial in the shade. In the sun it will\nmark the hour. Among those who enjoy his thought he will\nregain his tongue.",
        "Friendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and\nunlikeness that piques each with the presence of power\nand of consent in the other party. Let me be alone to\nthe end of the world, rather than that my friend should\noverstep, by a word or a look, his real sympathy. I am\nequally balked by antagonism and by compliance. Let him\nnot cease an instant to be himself. The only joy I have\nin his being mine, is that the not mine is mine. I hate,\nwhere I looked for a manly furtherance, or at least a\nmanly resistance, to find a mush of concession. Better\nbe a nettle in the side of your friend than his echo. The\ncondition which high friendship demands is ability to do\nwithout it. That high office requires great and sublime\nparts. There must be very two, before there can be very\none. Let it be an alliance of two large, formidable\nnatures, mutually beheld, mutually feared, before yet\nthey recognize the deep identity which, beneath these\ndisparities, unites them.",
        "He only is fit for this society who is magnanimous; who\nis sure that greatness and goodness are always economy;\nwho is not swift to intermeddle with his fortunes. Let\nhim not intermeddle with this. Leave to the diamond its\nages to grow, nor expect to accelerate the births of the\neternal. Friendship demands a religious treatment. We\ntalk of choosing our friends, but friends are self-elected.\nReverence is a great part of it. Treat your friend as a\nspectacle. Of course he has merits that are not yours, and\nthat you cannot honor if you must needs hold him close to\nyour person. Stand aside; give those merits room; let them\nmount and expand. Are you the friend of your friend’s\nbuttons, or of his thought? To a great heart he will still\nbe a stranger in a thousand particulars, that he may come\nnear in the holiest ground. Leave it to girls and boys to\nregard a friend as property, and to suck a short and all-\nconfounding pleasure, instead of the noblest benefit.",
        "Let us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation.\nWhy should we desecrate noble and beautiful souls by\nintruding on them? Why insist on rash personal relations\nwith your friend? Why go to his house, or know his mother\nand brother and sisters? Why be visited by him at your\nown? Are these things material to our covenant? Leave this\ntouching and clawing. Let him be to me a spirit. A message,\na thought, a sincerity, a glance from him, I want, but not\nnews, nor pottage. I can get politics and chat and neighborly\nconveniences from cheaper companions. Should not the society\nof my friend be to me poetic, pure, universal and great as\nnature itself? Ought I to feel that our tie is profane in\ncomparison with yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the\nhorizon, or that clump of waving grass that divides the\nbrook? Let us not vilify, but raise it to that standard.\nThat great defying eye, that scornful beauty of his mien\nand action, do not pique yourself on reducing, but rather\nfortify and enhance. Worship his superiorities; wish him\nnot less by a thought, but hoard and tell them all. Guard\nhim as thy counterpart. Let him be to thee for ever a sort\nof beautiful enemy, untamable, devoutly revered, and not a\ntrivial conveniency to be soon outgrown and cast aside.\nThe hues of the opal, the light of the diamond, are not to\nbe seen if the eye is too near. To my friend I write a\nletter and from him I receive a letter. That seems to you\na little. It suffices me. It is a spiritual gift worthy of\nhim to give and of me to receive. It profanes nobody. In\nthese warm lines the heart will trust itself, as it will\nnot to the tongue, and pour out the prophecy of a godlier\nexistence than all the annals of heroism have yet made good.",
        "Respect so far the holy laws of this fellowship as not\nto prejudice its perfect flower by your impatience\nfor its opening. We must be our own before we can be\nanother’s. There is at least this satisfaction in crime,\naccording to the Latin proverb;—you can speak to your\naccomplice on even terms. Crimen quos inquinat, aequat.\nTo those whom we admire and love, at first we cannot.\nYet the least defect of self-possession vitiates, in my\njudgment, the entire relation. There can never be deep\npeace between two spirits, never mutual respect, until\nin their dialogue each stands for the whole world.",
        "What is so great as friendship, let us carry with what\ngrandeur of spirit we can. Let us be silent,—so we may\nhear the whisper of the gods. Let us not interfere. Who\nset you to cast about what you should say to the select\nsouls, or how to say any thing to such? No matter how\ningenious, no matter how graceful and bland. There are\ninnumerable degrees of folly and wisdom, and for you to\nsay aught is to be frivolous.  Wait, and thy heart shall\nspeak. Wait until the necessary and everlasting overpowers\nyou, until day and night avail themselves of your lips.\nThe only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to have\na friend is to be one. You shall not come nearer a man by\ngetting into his house. If unlike, his soul only flees the\nfaster from you, and you shall never catch a true glance\nof his eye. We see the noble afar off and they repel us;\nwhy should we intrude? Late,—very late,—we perceive that\nno arrangements, no introductions, no consuetudes or habits\nof society would be of any avail to establish us in such\nrelations with them as we desire,—but solely the uprise\nof nature in us to the same degree it is in them; then\nshall we meet as water with water; and if we should not\nmeet them then, we shall not want them, for we are already\nthey. In the last analysis, love is only the reflection of\na man’s own worthiness from other men. Men have sometimes\nexchanged names with their friends, as if they would\nsignify that in their friend each loved his own soul.",
        "The higher the style we demand of friendship, of course\nthe less easy to establish it with flesh and blood.  We\nwalk alone in the world. Friends such as we desire are\ndreams and fables. But a sublime hope cheers ever the\nfaithful heart, that elsewhere, in other regions of the\nuniversal power, souls are now acting, enduring, and\ndaring, which can love us and which we can love. We may\ncongratulate ourselves that the period of nonage, of\nfollies, of blunders and of shame, is passed in solitude,\nand when we are finished men we shall grasp heroic hands\nin heroic hands. Only be admonished by what you already\nsee, not to strike leagues of friendship with cheap\npersons, where no friendship can be. Our impatience\nbetrays us into rash and foolish alliances which no god\nattends. By persisting in your path, though you forfeit\nthe little you gain the great. You demonstrate yourself,\nso as to put yourself out of the reach of false relations,\nand you draw to you the first-born of the world,—those\nrare pilgrims whereof only one or two wander in nature at\nonce, and before whom the vulgar great show as spectres\nand shadows merely.",
        "It is foolish to be afraid of making our ties too\nspiritual, as if so we could lose any genuine love.\nWhatever correction of our popular views we make from\ninsight, nature will be sure to bear us out in, and\nthough it seem to rob us of some joy, will repay us\nwith a greater. Let us feel if we will the absolute\ninsulation of man. We are sure that we have all in us.\nWe go to Europe, or we pursue persons, or we read books,\nin the instinctive faith that these will call it out and\nreveal us to ourselves. Beggars all. The persons are such\nas we; the Europe, an old faded garment of dead persons;\nthe books, their ghosts. Let us drop this idolatry. Let\nus give over this mendicancy. Let us even bid our dearest\nfriends farewell, and defy them, saying, ’Who are you?\nUnhand me: I will be dependent no more.’ Ah! seest thou\nnot, O brother, that thus we part only to meet again on\na higher platform, and only be more each other’s because\nwe are more our own? A friend is Janus-faced; he looks to\nthe past and the future. He is the child of all my\nforegoing hours, the prophet of those to come, and the\nharbinger of a greater friend.",
        "I do then with my friends as I do with my books. I would\nhave them where I can find them, but I seldom use them.\nWe must have society on our own terms, and admit or\nexclude it on the slightest cause. I cannot afford to\nspeak much with my friend. If he is great he makes me\nso great that I cannot descend to converse. In the great\ndays, presentiments hover before me in the firmament. I\nought then to dedicate myself to them. I go in that I may\nseize them, I go out that I may seize them. I fear only\nthat I may lose them receding into the sky in which now\nthey are only a patch of brighter light. Then, though I\nprize my friends, I cannot afford to talk with them and\nstudy their visions, lest I lose my own. It would indeed\ngive me a certain household joy to quit this lofty seeking,\nthis spiritual astronomy or search of stars, and come down\nto warm sympathies with you; but then I know well I shall\nmourn always the vanishing of my mighty gods. It is true,\nnext week I shall have languid moods, when I can well\nafford to occupy myself with foreign objects; then I shall\nregret the lost literature of your mind, and wish you were\nby my side again. But if you come, perhaps you will fill\nmy mind only with new visions; not with yourself but with\nyour lustres, and I shall not be able any more than now to\nconverse with you. So I will owe to my friends this\nevanescent intercourse. I will receive from them not what\nthey have but what they are. They shall give me that which\nproperly they cannot give, but which emanates from them.\nBut they shall not hold me by any relations less subtile\nand pure. We will meet as though we met not, and part as\nthough we parted not.",
        "It has seemed to me lately more possible than I knew,\nto carry a friendship greatly, on one side, without\ndue correspondence on the other. Why should I cumber\nmyself with regrets that the receiver is not capacious?\nIt never troubles the sun that some of his rays fall\nwide and vain into ungrateful space, and only a small\npart on the reflecting planet. Let your greatness\neducate the crude and cold companion. If he is unequal\nhe will presently pass away; but thou art enlarged by\nthy own shining, and no longer a mate for frogs and\nworms, dost soar and burn with the gods of the empyrean.\nIt is thought a disgrace to love unrequited. But the\ngreat will see that true love cannot be unrequited.\nTrue love transcends the unworthy object and dwells and\nbroods on the eternal, and when the poor interposed mask\ncrumbles, it is not sad, but feels rid of so much earth\nand feels its independency the surer. Yet these things\nmay hardly be said without a sort of treachery to the\nrelation. The essence of friendship is entireness, a\ntotal magnanimity and trust. It must not surmise or\nprovide for infirmity. It treats its object as a god,\nthat it may deify both.",
        "What right have I to write on Prudence, whereof I have\nLittle, and that of the negative sort? My prudence\nconsists in avoiding and going without, not in the\ninventing of means and methods, not in adroit steering,\nnot in gentle repairing. I have no skill to make money\nspend well, no genius in my economy, and whoever sees\nmy garden discovers that I must have some other garden.\nYet I love facts, and hate lubricity and people without\nperception. Then I have the same title to write on prudence\nthat I have to write on poetry or holiness. We write from\naspiration and antagonism, as well as from experience. We\npaint those qualities which we do not possess. The poet\nadmires the man of energy and tactics; the merchant breeds\nhis son for the church or the bar; and where a man is not\nvain and egotistic you shall find what he has not by his\npraise. Moreover it would be hardly honest in me not to\nbalance these fine lyric words of Love and Friendship with\nwords of coarser sound, and whilst my debt to my senses is\nreal and constant, not to own it in passing.",
        "Prudence is the virtue of the senses. It is the science\nof appearances. It is the outmost action of the inward\nlife. It is God taking thought for oxen. It moves matter\nafter the laws of matter. It is content to seek health\nof body by complying with physical conditions, and health\nof mind by the laws of the intellect.",
        "The world of the senses is a world of shows; it does not\nexist for itself, but has a symbolic character; and a true\nprudence or law of shows recognizes the co-presence of other\nlaws and knows that its own office is subaltern; knows that\nit is surface and not centre where it works. Prudence is\nfalse when detached. It is legitimate when it is the Natural\nHistory of the soul incarnate, when it unfolds the beauty\nof laws within the narrow scope of the senses.",
        "There are all degrees of proficiency in knowledge of the\nworld. It is sufficient to our present purpose to indicate\nthree. One class live to the utility of the symbol,\nesteeming health and wealth a final good.  Another class\nlive above this mark to the beauty of the symbol, as the\npoet and artist and the naturalist and man of science. A\nthird class live above the beauty of the symbol to the\nbeauty of the thing signified; these are wise men. The\nfirst class have common sense; the second, taste; and the\nthird, spiritual perception. Once in a long time, a man\ntraverses the whole scale, and sees and enjoys the symbol\nsolidly, then also has a clear eye for its beauty, and\nlastly, whilst he pitches his tent on this sacred volcanic\nisle of nature, does not offer to build houses and barns\nthereon,—reverencing the splendor of the God which he\nsees bursting through each chink and cranny.",
        "The world is filled with the proverbs and acts and\nwinkings of a base prudence, which is a devotion to\nmatter, as if we possessed no other faculties than\nthe palate, the nose, the touch, the eye and ear; a\nprudence which adores the Rule of Three, which never\nsubscribes, which never gives, which seldom lends,\nand asks but one question of any project,—Will it\nbake bread? This is a disease like a thickening of\nthe skin until the vital organs are destroyed. But\nculture, revealing the high origin of the apparent\nworld and aiming at the perfection of the man as the\nend, degrades every thing else, as health and bodily\nlife, into means. It sees prudence not to be a several\nfaculty, but a name for wisdom and virtue conversing\nwith the body and its wants. Cultivated men always feel\nand speak so, as if a great fortune, the achievement of\na civil or social measure, great personal influence, a\ngraceful and commanding address, had their value as\nproofs of the energy of the spirit. If a man lose his\nbalance and immerse himself in any trades or pleasures\nfor their own sake, he may be a good wheel or pin, but\nhe is not a cultivated man.",
        "The spurious prudence, making the senses final, is the\ngod of sots and cowards, and is the subject of all\ncomedy. It is nature’s joke, and therefore literature’s.\nThe true prudence limits this sensualism by admitting\nthe knowledge of an internal and real world. This\nrecognition once made, the order of the world and the\ndistribution of affairs and times, being studied with\nthe co-perception of their subordinate place, will\nreward any degree of attention. For our existence, thus\napparently attached in nature to the sun and the returning\nmoon and the periods which they mark,—so susceptible to\nclimate and to country, so alive to social good and evil,\nso fond of splendor and so tender to hunger and cold and\ndebt,—reads all its primary lessons out of these books.",
        "Prudence does not go behind nature and ask whence it is.\nIt takes the laws of the world whereby man’s being is\nconditioned, as they are, and keeps these laws that it\nmay enjoy their proper good. It respects space and time,\nclimate, want, sleep, the law of polarity, growth and\ndeath. There revolve, to give bound and period to his\nbeing on all sides, the sun and moon, the great formalists\nin the sky: here lies stubborn matter, and will not swerve\nfrom its chemical routine. Here is a planted globe, pierced\nand belted with natural laws and fenced and distributed\nexternally with civil partitions and properties which impose\nnew restraints on the young inhabitant.",
        "We eat of the bread which grows in the field. We live by\nthe air which blows around us and we are poisoned by the\nair that is too cold or too hot, too dry or too wet. Time,\nwhich shows so vacant, indivisible and divine in its coming,\nis slit and peddled into trifles and tatters. A door is to\nbe painted, a lock to be repaired. I want wood or oil, or\nmeal or salt; the house smokes, or I have a headache; then\nthe tax, and an affair to be transacted with a man without\nheart or brains, and the stinging recollection of an\ninjurious or very awkward word,—these eat up the hours.\nDo what we can, summer will have its flies; if we walk in\nthe woods we must feed mosquitos; if we go a-fishing we\nmust expect a wet coat.  Then climate is a great impediment\nto idle persons; we often resolve to give up the care of the\nweather, but still we regard the clouds and the rain.",
        "We are instructed by these petty experiences which usurp\nthe hours and years. The hard soil and four months of\nsnow make the inhabitant of the northern temperate zone\nwiser and abler than his fellow who enjoys the fixed\nsmile of the tropics. The islander may ramble all day\nat will. At night he may sleep on a mat under the moon,\nand wherever a wild date-tree grows, nature has, without\na prayer even, spread a table for his morning meal. The\nnortherner is perforce a householder. He must brew, bake,\nsalt and preserve his food, and pile wood and coal. But\nas it happens that not one stroke can labor lay to without\nsome new acquaintance with nature, and as nature is\ninexhaustibly significant, the inhabitants of these\nclimates have always excelled the southerner in force.\nSuch is the value of these matters that a man who knows\nother things can never know too much of these. Let him\nhave accurate perceptions. Let him, if he have hands,\nhandle; if eyes, measure and discriminate; let him accept\nand hive every fact of chemistry, natural history and\neconomics; the more he has, the less is he willing to\nspare any one. Time is always bringing the occasions that\ndisclose their value. Some wisdom comes out of every\nnatural and innocent action. The domestic man, who loves\nno music so well as his kitchen clock and the airs which\nthe logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth, has\nsolaces which others never dream of. The application of\nmeans to ends insures victory and the songs of victory not\nless in a farm or a shop than in the tactics of party or\nof war. The good husband finds method as efficient in the\npacking of fire-wood in a shed or in the harvesting of\nfruits in the cellar, as in Peninsular campaigns or the\nfiles of the Department of State. In the rainy day he\nbuilds a work-bench, or gets his tool-box set in the corner\nof the barn-chamber, and stored with nails, gimlet, pincers,\nscrewdriver and chisel. Herein he tastes an old joy of youth\nand childhood, the cat-like love of garrets, presses and\ncorn-chambers, and of the conveniences of long housekeeping.\nHis garden or his poultry-yard tells him many pleasant\nanecdotes. One might find argument for optimism in the\nabundant flow of this saccharine element of pleasure in\nevery suburb and extremity of the good world. Let a man\nkeep the law,—any law,—and his way will be strown with\nsatisfactions. There is more difference in the quality of\nour pleasures than in the amount.",
        "On the other hand, nature punishes any neglect of prudence.\nIf you think the senses final, obey their law.  If you\nbelieve in the soul, do not clutch at sensual sweetness\nbefore it is ripe on the slow tree of cause and effect.\nIt is vinegar to the eyes to deal with men of loose and\nimperfect perception. Dr. Johnson is reported to have said,\n—\"If the child says he looked out of this window, when he\nlooked out of that,—whip him.” Our American character is\nmarked by a more than average delight in accurate perception,\nwhich is shown by the currency of the byword, “No mistake.\"\nBut the discomfort of unpunctuality, of confusion of thought\nabout facts, of inattention to the wants of to-morrow, is\nof no nation. The beautiful laws of time and space, once\ndislocated by our inaptitude, are holes and dens. If the\nhive be disturbed by rash and stupid hands, instead of honey\nit will yield us bees. Our words and actions to be fair must\nbe timely. A gay and pleasant sound is the whetting of the\nscythe in the mornings of June, yet what is more lonesome\nand sad than the sound of a whetstone or mower’s rifle when\nit is too late in the season to make hay? Scatter-brained\nand “afternoon” men spoil much more than their own affair\nin spoiling the temper of those who deal with them. I have\nseen a criticism on some paintings, of which I am reminded\nwhen I see the shiftless and unhappy men who are not true\nto their senses. The last Grand Duke of Weimar, a man of\nsuperior understanding, said,—\"I have sometimes remarked\nin the presence of great works of art, and just now\nespecially in Dresden, how much a certain property\ncontributes to the effect which gives life to the figures,\nand to the life an irresistible truth. This property is\nthe hitting, in all the figures we draw, the right centre\nof gravity. I mean the placing the figures firm upon their\nfeet, making the hands grasp, and fastening the eyes on\nthe spot where they should look. Even lifeless figures, as\nvessels and stools—let them be drawn ever so correctly—\nlose all effect so soon as they lack the resting upon their\ncentre of gravity, and have a certain swimming and oscillating\nappearance. The Raphael in the Dresden gallery (the only\ngreatly affecting picture which I have seen) is the quietest\nand most passionless piece you can imagine; a couple of saints\nwho worship the Virgin and Child.  Nevertheless, it awakens a\ndeeper impression than the contortions of ten crucified\nmartyrs. For beside all the resistless beauty of form, it\npossesses in the highest degree the property of the\nperpendicularity of all the figures.” This perpendicularity\nwe demand of all the figures in this picture of life. Let\nthem stand on their feet, and not float and swing. Let us\nknow where to find them. Let them discriminate between what\nthey remember and what they dreamed, call a spade a spade,\ngive us facts, and honor their own senses with trust.",
        "But what man shall dare tax another with imprudence?\nWho is prudent? The men we call greatest are least in\nthis kingdom. There is a certain fatal dislocation in\nour relation to nature, distorting our modes of living\nand making every law our enemy, which seems at last to\nhave aroused all the wit and virtue in the world to\nponder the question of Reform. We must call the highest\nprudence to counsel, and ask why health and beauty and\ngenius should now be the exception rather than the rule\nof human nature? We do not know the properties of plants\nand animals and the laws of nature, through our sympathy\nwith the same; but this remains the dream of poets. Poetry\nand prudence should be coincident. Poets should be\nlawgivers; that is, the boldest lyric inspiration should\nnot chide and insult, but should announce and lead the\ncivil code and the day’s work. But now the two things seem\nirreconcilably parted. We have violated law upon law until\nwe stand amidst ruins, and when by chance we espy a\ncoincidence between reason and the phenomena, we are\nsurprised. Beauty should be the dowry of every man and\nwoman, as invariably as sensation; but it is rare. Health\nor sound organization should be universal. Genius should\nbe the child of genius and every child should be inspired;\nbut now it is not to be predicted of any child, and nowhere\nis it pure. We call partial half-lights, by courtesy,\ngenius; talent which converts itself to money; talent which\nglitters to-day that it may dine and sleep well to-morrow;\nand society is officered by men of parts, as they are properly\ncalled, and not by divine men. These use their gifts to refine\nluxury, not to abolish it. Genius is always ascetic, and piety,\nand love. Appetite shows to the finer souls as a disease, and\nthey find beauty in rites and bounds that resist it.",
        "We have found out fine names to cover our sensuality\nwithal, but no gifts can raise intemperance. The man\nof talent affects to call his transgressions of the\nlaws of the senses trivial and to count them nothing\nconsidered with his devotion to his art. His art never\ntaught him lewdness, nor the love of wine, nor the\nwish to reap where he had not sowed. His art is less\nfor every deduction from his holiness, and less for\nevery defect of common sense. On him who scorned the\nworld as he said, the scorned world wreaks its revenge.\nHe that despiseth small things will perish by little\nand little. Goethe’s Tasso is very likely to be a\npretty fair historical portrait, and that is true\ntragedy. It does not seem to me so genuine grief when\nsome tyrannous Richard the Third oppresses and slays a\nscore of innocent persons, as when Antonio and Tasso,\nboth apparently right, wrong each other. One living\nafter the maxims of this world and consistent and true\nto them, the other fired with all divine sentiments,\nyet grasping also at the pleasures of sense, without\nsubmitting to their law. That is a grief we all feel,\na knot we cannot untie. Tasso’s is no infrequent case\nin modern biography. A man of genius, of an ardent\ntemperament, reckless of physical laws, self-indulgent,\nbecomes presently unfortunate, querulous, a “discomfortable\ncousin,” a thorn to himself and to others.",
        "The scholar shames us by his bifold life. Whilst\nsomething higher than prudence is active, he is\nadmirable; when common sense is wanted, he is an\nencumbrance. Yesterday, Caesar was not so great;\nto-day, the felon at the gallows’ foot is not more\nmiserable. Yesterday, radiant with the light of an\nideal world in which he lives, the first of men; and\nnow oppressed by wants and by sickness, for which he\nmust thank himself. He resembles the pitiful drivellers\nwhom travellers describe as frequenting the bazaars of\nConstantinople, who skulk about all day, yellow,\nemaciated, ragged, sneaking; and at evening, when the\nbazaars are open, slink to the opium-shop, swallow their\nmorsel and become tranquil and glorified seers. And who\nhas not seen the tragedy of imprudent genius struggling\nfor years with paltry pecuniary difficulties, at last\nsinking, chilled, exhausted and fruitless, like a giant\nslaughtered by pins?",
        "Is it not better that a man should accept the first\npains and mortifications of this sort, which nature\nis not slack in sending him, as hints that he must\nexpect no other good than the just fruit of his own\nlabor and self-denial? Health, bread, climate, social\nposition, have their importance, and he will give them\ntheir due.  Let him esteem Nature a perpetual counsellor,\nand her perfections the exact measure of our deviations.\nLet him make the night night, and the day day. Let him\ncontrol the habit of expense. Let him see that as much\nwisdom may be expended on a private economy as on an\nempire, and as much wisdom may be drawn from it. The\nlaws of the world are written out for him on every\npiece of money in his hand. There is nothing he will\nnot be the better for knowing, were it only the wisdom\nof Poor Richard, or the State-Street prudence of buying\nby the acre to sell by the foot; or the thrift of the\nagriculturist, to stick a tree between whiles, because\nit will grow whilst he sleeps; or the prudence which\nconsists in husbanding little strokes of the tool,\nlittle portions of time, particles of stock and small\ngains. The eye of prudence may never shut. Iron, if kept\nat the ironmonger’s, will rust; beer, if not brewed in\nthe right state of the atmosphere, will sour; timber of\nships will rot at sea, or if laid up high and dry, will\nstrain, warp and dry-rot; money, if kept by us, yields\nno rent and is liable to loss; if invested, is liable to\ndepreciation of the particular kind of stock. Strike,\nsays the smith, the iron is white; keep the rake, says\nthe haymaker, as nigh the scythe as you can, and the cart\nas nigh the rake. Our Yankee trade is reputed to be very\nmuch on the extreme of this prudence. It takes bank-notes,\ngood, bad, clean, ragged, and saves itself by the speed\nwith which it passes them off. Iron cannot rust, nor beer\nsour, nor timber rot, nor calicoes go out of fashion, nor\nmoney stocks depreciate, in the few swift moments in which\nthe Yankee suffers any one of them to remain in his\npossession. In skating over thin ice our safety is in our\nspeed.",
        "Let him learn a prudence of a higher strain. Let him\nlearn that every thing in nature, even motes and\nfeathers, go by law and not by luck, and that what he\nsows he reaps. By diligence and self-command let him\nput the bread he eats at his own disposal, that he may\nnot stand in bitter and false relations to other men;\nfor the best good of wealth is freedom. Let him practise\nthe minor virtues. How much of human life is lost in\nwaiting! let him not make his fellow-creatures wait. How\nmany words and promises are promises of conversation!\nLet his be words of fate. When he sees a folded and sealed\nscrap of paper float round the globe in a pine ship and\ncome safe to the eye for which it was written, amidst a\nswarming population, let him likewise feel the admonition\nto integrate his being across all these distracting forces,\nand keep a slender human word among the storms, distances\nand accidents that drive us hither and thither, and, by\npersistency, make the paltry force of one man reappear to\nredeem its pledge after months and years in the most distant\nclimates.",
        "We must not try to write the laws of any one virtue,\nlooking at that only. Human nature loves no contradictions,\nbut is symmetrical. The prudence which secures an outward\nwell-being is not to be studied by one set of men, whilst\nheroism and holiness are studied by another, but they are\nreconcilable.  Prudence concerns the present time, persons,\nproperty and existing forms. But as every fact hath its\nroots in the soul, and if the soul were changed, would cease\nto be, or would become some other thing,—the proper\nadministration of outward things will always rest on a just\napprehension of their cause and origin; that is, the good\nman will be the wise man, and the single-hearted the politic\nman. Every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide\nin the liar, but is a stab at the health of human society.\nOn the most profitable lie the course of events presently\nlays a destructive tax; whilst frankness invites frankness,\nputs the parties on a convenient footing and makes their\nbusiness a friendship. Trust men and they will be true to\nyou; treat them greatly and they will show themselves great,\nthough they make an exception in your favor to all their\nrules of trade.",
        "So, in regard to disagreeable and formidable things,\nprudence does not consist in evasion or in flight, but\nin courage. He who wishes to walk in the most peaceful\nparts of life with any serenity must screw himself up\nto resolution. Let him front the object of his worst\napprehension, and his stoutness will commonly make his\nfear groundless. The Latin proverb says, “In battles the\neye is first overcome.”  Entire self-possession may make\na battle very little more dangerous to life than a match\nat foils or at football. Examples are cited by soldiers\nof men who have seen the cannon pointed and the fire given\nto it, and who have stepped aside from the path of the ball.\nThe terrors of the storm are chiefly confined to the parlor\nand the cabin. The drover, the sailor, buffets it all day,\nand his health renews itself at as vigorous a pulse under\nthe sleet as under the sun of June.",
        "In the occurrence of unpleasant things among neighbors,\nfear comes readily to heart and magnifies the consequence\nof the other party; but it is a bad counsellor. Every man\nis actually weak and apparently strong. To himself he\nseems weak; to others, formidable. You are afraid of Grim;\nbut Grim also is afraid of you. You are solicitous of the\ngood-will of the meanest person, uneasy at his ill-will.\nBut the sturdiest offender of your peace and of the\nneighborhood, if you rip up his claims, is as thin and\ntimid as any, and the peace of society is often kept,\nbecause, as children say, one is afraid, and the other\ndares not. Far off, men swell, bully and threaten; bring\nthem hand to hand, and they are a feeble folk.",
        "It is a proverb that ’courtesy costs nothing’; but\ncalculation might come to value love for its profit.\nLove is fabled to be blind, but kindness is necessary\nto perception; love is not a hood, but an eye-water.\nIf you meet a sectary or a hostile partisan, never\nrecognize the dividing lines, but meet on what common\nground remains,—if only that the sun shines and the\nrain rains for both; the area will widen very fast,\nand ere you know it, the boundary mountains on which\nthe eye had fastened have melted into air. If they\nset out to contend, Saint Paul will lie and Saint John\nwill hate. What low, poor, paltry, hypocritical people\nan argument on religion will make of the pure and chosen\nsouls! They will shuffle and crow, crook and hide, feign\nto confess here, only that they may brag and conquer\nthere, and not a thought has enriched either party, and\nnot an emotion of bravery, modesty, or hope. So neither\nshould you put yourself in a false position with your\ncontemporaries by indulging a vein of hostility and\nbitterness.  Though your views are in straight antagonism\nto theirs, assume an identity of sentiment, assume that\nyou are saying precisely that which all think, and in the\nflow of wit and love roll out your paradoxes in solid\ncolumn, with not the infirmity of a doubt. So at least\nshall you get an adequate deliverance. The natural motions\nof the soul are so much better than the voluntary ones that\nyou will never do yourself justice in dispute. The thought\nis not then taken hold of by the right handle, does not show\nitself proportioned and in its true bearings, but bears\nextorted, hoarse, and half witness. But assume a consent and\nit shall presently be granted, since really and underneath\ntheir external diversities, all men are of one heart and\nmind.",
        "Wisdom will never let us stand with any man or men on\nan unfriendly footing. We refuse sympathy and intimacy\nwith people, as if we waited for some better sympathy\nand intimacy to come. But whence and when? To-morrow\nwill be like to-day. Life wastes itself whilst we are\npreparing to live. Our friends and fellow-workers die\noff from us. Scarcely can we say we see new men, new\nwomen, approaching us.  We are too old to regard fashion,\ntoo old to expect patronage of any greater or more powerful.\nLet us suck the sweetness of those affections and consuetudes\nthat grow near us. These old shoes are easy to the feet.\nUndoubtedly we can easily pick faults in our company, can\neasily whisper names prouder, and that tickle the fancy more.\nEvery man’s imagination hath its friends; and life would be\ndearer with such companions. But if you cannot have them on\ngood mutual terms, you cannot have them. If not the Deity\nbut our ambition hews and shapes the new relations, their\nvirtue escapes, as strawberries lose their flavor in garden-beds.",
        "Thus truth, frankness, courage, love, humility and all\nthe virtues range themselves on the side of prudence,\nor the art of securing a present well-being. I do not\nknow if all matter will be found to be made of one\nelement, as oxygen or hydrogen, at last, but the world\nof manners and actions is wrought of one stuff, and\nbegin where we will we are pretty sure in a short space\nto be mumbling our ten commandments.",
        "In the elder English dramatists, and mainly in the plays\nOf Beaumont and Fletcher, there is a constant recognition\nof gentility, as if a noble behavior were as easily marked\nin the society of their age as color is in our American\npopulation. When any Rodrigo, Pedro or Valerio enters,\nthough he be a stranger, the duke or governor exclaims,\n’This is a gentleman,—and proffers civilities without\nend; but all the rest are slag and refuse. In harmony\nwith this delight in personal advantages there is in\ntheir plays a certain heroic cast of character and dialogue,\n—as in Bonduca, Sophocles, the Mad Lover, the Double\nMarriage,—wherein the speaker is so earnest and cordial\nand on such deep grounds of character, that the dialogue,\non the slightest additional incident in the plot, rises\nnaturally into poetry. Among many texts take the following.\nThe Roman Martius has conquered Athens,—all but the\ninvincible spirits of Sophocles, the duke of Athens, and\nDorigen, his wife. The beauty of the latter inflames\nMartius, and he seeks to save her husband; but Sophocles\nwill not ask his life, although assured that a word will\nsave him, and the execution of both proceeds:—",
        "I do not readily remember any poem, play, sermon, novel,\nor oration that our press vents in the last few years,\nwhich goes to the same tune. We have a great many flutes\nand flageolets, but not often the sound of any fife. Yet,\nWordsworth’s “Laodamia,” and the ode of “Dion,” and some\nsonnets, have a certain noble music; and Scott will\nsometimes draw a stroke like the portrait of Lord Evandale\ngiven by Balfour of Burley. Thomas Carlyle, with his natural\ntaste for what is manly and daring in character, has suffered\nno heroic trait in his favorites to drop from his biographical\nand historical pictures. Earlier, Robert Burns has given us\na song or two. In the Harleian Miscellanies there is an\naccount of the battle of Lutzen which deserves to be read.\nAnd Simon Ockley’s History of the Saracens recounts the\nprodigies of individual valor, with admiration all the more\nevident on the part of the narrator that he seems to think\nthat his place in Christian Oxford requires of him some\nproper protestations of abhorrence. But if we explore the\nliterature of Heroism we shall quickly come to Plutarch,\nwho is its Doctor and historian. To him we owe the Brasidas,\nthe Dion, the Epaminondas, the Scipio of old, and I must\nthink we are more deeply indebted to him than to all the\nancient writers. Each of his “Lives” is a refutation to the\ndespondency and cowardice of our religious and political\ntheorists. A wild courage, a Stoicism not of the schools\nbut of the blood, shines in every anecdote, and has given\nthat book its immense fame.",
        "We need books of this tart cathartic virtue more than\nbooks of political science or of private economy.  Life\nis a festival only to the wise. Seen from the nook and\nchimney-side of prudence, it wears a ragged and dangerous\nfront. The violations of the laws of nature by our\npredecessors and our contemporaries are punished in us\nalso. The disease and deformity around us certify the\ninfraction of natural, intellectual, and moral laws, and\noften violation on violation to breed such compound\nmisery. A lock-jaw that bends a man’s head back to his\nheels; hydrophobia that makes him bark at his wife and\nbabes; insanity that makes him eat grass; war, plague,\ncholera, famine, indicate a certain ferocity in nature,\nwhich, as it had its inlet by human crime, must have its\noutlet by human suffering. Unhappily no man exists who\nhas not in his own person become to some amount a stockholder\nin the sin, and so made himself liable to a share in the\nexpiation.",
        "Our culture therefore must not omit the arming of the\nman. Let him hear in season that he is born into the\nstate of war, and that the commonwealth and his own\nwell-being require that he should not go dancing in\nthe weeds of peace, but warned, self-collected and\nneither defying nor dreading the thunder, let him take\nboth reputation and life in his hand, and, with perfect\nurbanity dare the gibbet and the mob by the absolute\ntruth of his speech and the rectitude of his behavior.",
        "Towards all this external evil the man within the breast\nassumes a warlike attitude, and affirms his ability to\ncope single-handed with the infinite army of enemies. To\nthis military attitude of the soul we give the name of\nHeroism. Its rudest form is the contempt for safety and\nease, which makes the attractiveness of war. It is a\nself-trust which slights the restraints of prudence, in\nthe plenitude of its energy and power to repair the harms\nit may suffer. The hero is a mind of such balance that no\ndisturbances can shake his will, but pleasantly and as it\nwere merrily he advances to his own music, alike in\nfrightful alarms and in the tipsy mirth of universal\ndissoluteness. There is somewhat not philosophical in\nheroism; there is somewhat not holy in it; it seems not\nto know that other souls are of one texture with it; it\nhas pride; it is the extreme of individual nature.\nNevertheless we must profoundly revere it. There is\nsomewhat in great actions which does not allow us to\ngo behind them. Heroism feels and never reasons, and\ntherefore is always right; and although a different\nbreeding, different religion and greater intellectual\nactivity would have modified or even reversed the\nparticular action, yet for the hero that thing he does\nis the highest deed, and is not open to the censure of\nphilosophers or divines. It is the avowal of the unschooled\nman that he finds a quality in him that is negligent of\nexpense, of health, of life, of danger, of hatred, of\nreproach, and knows that his will is higher and more\nexcellent than all actual and all possible antagonists.",
        "Heroism works in contradiction to the voice of mankind\nand in contradiction, for a time, to the voice of the\ngreat and good. Heroism is an obedience to a secret\nimpulse of an individual’s character. Now to no other\nman can its wisdom appear as it does to him, for every\nman must be supposed to see a little farther on his own\nproper path than any one else. Therefore just and wise\nmen take umbrage at his act, until after some little\ntime be past: then they see it to be in unison with their\nacts. All prudent men see that the action is clean\ncontrary to a sensual prosperity; for every heroic act\nmeasures itself by its contempt of some external good.\nBut it finds its own success at last, and then the\nprudent also extol.",
        "Self-trust is the essence of heroism. It is the state\nof the soul at war, and its ultimate objects are the\nlast defiance of falsehood and wrong, and the power to\nbear all that can be inflicted by evil agents. It speaks\nthe truth and it is just, generous, hospitable, temperate,\nscornful of petty calculations and scornful of being\nscorned. It persists; it is of an undaunted boldness and\nof a fortitude not to be wearied out. Its jest is the\nlittleness of common life. That false prudence which\ndotes on health and wealth is the butt and merriment of\nheroism. Heroism, like Plotinus, is almost ashamed of its\nbody. What shall it say then to the sugar-plums and\ncats’-cradles, to the toilet, compliments, quarrels, cards\nand custard, which rack the wit of all society? What joys\nhas kind nature provided for us dear creatures! There\nseems to be no interval between greatness and meanness.\nWhen the spirit is not master of the world, then it is\nits dupe.  Yet the little man takes the great hoax so\ninnocently, works in it so headlong and believing, is\nborn red, and dies gray, arranging his toilet, attending\non his own health, laying traps for sweet food and strong\nwine, setting his heart on a horse or a rifle, made happy\nwith a little gossip or a little praise, that the great\nsoul cannot choose but laugh at such earnest nonsense.\n\"Indeed, these humble considerations make me out of love\nwith greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to take note\nhow many pairs of silk stockings thou hast, namely, these\nand those that were the peach-colored ones; or to bear the\ninventory of thy shirts, as one for superfluity, and one\nother for use!”",
        "Citizens, thinking after the laws of arithmetic,\nconsider the inconvenience of receiving strangers at\ntheir fireside, reckon narrowly the loss of time and\nthe unusual display; the soul of a better quality\nthrusts back the unseasonable economy into the vaults\nof life, and says, I will obey the God, and the\nsacrifice and the fire he will provide. Ibn Hankal,\nthe Arabian geographer, describes a heroic extreme in\nthe hospitality of Sogd, in Bukharia. “When I was in\nSogd I saw a great building, like a palace, the gates\nof which were open and fixed back to the wall with\nlarge nails. I asked the reason, and was told that the\nhouse had not been shut, night or day, for a hundred\nyears. Strangers may present themselves at any hour\nand in whatever number; the master has amply provided\nfor the reception of the men and their animals, and is\nnever happier than when they tarry for some time.\nNothing of the kind have I seen in any other country.\"\nThe magnanimous know very well that they who give time,\nor money, or shelter, to the stranger,—so it be done\nfor love and not for ostentation,—do, as it were, put\nGod under obligation to them, so perfect are the\ncompensations of the universe. In some way the time\nthey seem to lose is redeemed and the pains they seem\nto take remunerate themselves. These men fan the flame\nof human love and raise the standard of civil virtue\namong mankind. But hospitality must be for service and\nnot for show, or it pulls down the host. The brave soul\nrates itself too high to value itself by the splendor\nof its table and draperies. It gives what it hath, and\nall it hath, but its own majesty can lend a better grace\nto bannocks and fair water than belong to city feasts.",
        "The temperance of the hero proceeds from the same wish\nto do no dishonor to the worthiness he has.  But he\nloves it for its elegancy, not for its austerity. It\nseems not worth his while to be solemn and denounce with\nbitterness flesh-eating or wine-drinking, the use of\ntobacco, or opium, or tea, or silk, or gold. A great man\nscarcely knows how he dines, how he dresses; but without\nrailing or precision his living is natural and poetic.\nJohn Eliot, the Indian Apostle, drank water, and said of\nwine,—\"It is a noble, generous liquor and we should be\nhumbly thankful for it, but, as I remember, water was\nmade before it.” Better still is the temperance of King\nDavid, who poured out on the ground unto the Lord the water\nwhich three of his warriors had brought him to drink, at\nthe peril of their lives.",
        "It is told of Brutus, that when he fell on his sword\nafter the battle of Philippi, he quoted a line of\nEuripides,—\"O Virtue! I have followed thee through\nlife, and I find thee at last but a shade.” I doubt\nnot the hero is slandered by this report. The heroic\nsoul does not sell its justice and its nobleness. It\ndoes not ask to dine nicely and to sleep warm. The\nessence of greatness is the perception that virtue is\nenough.  Poverty is its ornament. It does not need\nplenty, and can very well abide its loss.",
        "But that which takes my fancy most in the heroic class,\nis the good-humor and hilarity they exhibit. It is a\nheight to which common duty can very well attain, to\nsuffer and to dare with solemnity. But these rare souls\nset opinion, success, and life at so cheap a rate that\nthey will not soothe their enemies by petitions, or the\nshow of sorrow, but wear their own habitual greatness.\nScipio, charged with peculation, refuses to do himself\nso great a disgrace as to wait for justification, though\nhe had the scroll of his accounts in his hands, but tears\nit to pieces before the tribunes. Socrates’s condemnation\nof himself to be maintained in all honor in the Prytaneum,\nduring his life, and Sir Thomas More’s playfulness at the\nscaffold, are of the same strain. In Beaumont and Fletcher’s\n\"Sea Voyage,” Juletta tells the stout captain and his\ncompany,—",
        "These replies are sound and whole. Sport is the bloom\nand glow of a perfect health. The great will not\ncondescend to take any thing seriously; all must be as\ngay as the song of a canary, though it were the building\nof cities or the eradication of old and foolish churches\nand nations which have cumbered the earth long thousands\nof years. Simple hearts put all the history and customs\nof this world behind them, and play their own game in\ninnocent defiance of the Blue-Laws of the world; and such\nwould appear, could we see the human race assembled in\nvision, like little children frolicking together, though\nto the eyes of mankind at large they wear a stately and\nsolemn garb of works and influences.",
        "The interest these fine stories have for us, the power\nof a romance over the boy who grasps the forbidden book\nunder his bench at school, our delight in the hero, is\nthe main fact to our purpose. All these great and\ntranscendent properties are ours. If we dilate in\nbeholding the Greek energy, the Roman pride, it is that\nwe are already domesticating the same sentiment. Let us\nfind room for this great guest in our small houses. The\nfirst step of worthiness will be to disabuse us of our\nsuperstitious associations with places and times, with\nnumber and size. Why should these words, Athenian, Roman,\nAsia and England, so tingle in the ear? Where the heart\nis, there the muses, there the gods sojourn, and not in\nany geography of fame. Massachusetts, Connecticut River\nand Boston Bay you think paltry places, and the ear loves\nnames of foreign and classic topography. But here we are;\nand, if we will tarry a little, we may come to learn that\nhere is best. See to it only that thyself is here, and art\nand nature, hope and fate, friends, angels and the Supreme\nBeing shall not be absent from the chamber where thou\nsittest.  Epaminondas, brave and affectionate, does not\nseem to us to need Olympus to die upon, nor the Syrian\nsunshine. He lies very well where he is. The Jerseys were\nhandsome ground enough for Washington to tread, and London\nstreets for the feet of Milton. A great man makes his\nclimate genial in the imagination of men, and its air the\nbeloved element of all delicate spirits. That country is\nthe fairest which is inhabited by the noblest minds. The\npictures which fill the imagination in reading the actions\nof Pericles, Xenophon, Columbus, Bayard, Sidney, Hampden,\nteach us how needlessly mean our life is; that we, by the\ndepth of our living, should deck it with more than regal\nor national splendor, and act on principles that should\ninterest man and nature in the length of our days.",
        "We have seen or heard of many extraordinary young men\nwho never ripened, or whose performance in actual life\nwas not extraordinary. When we see their air and mien,\nwhen we hear them speak of society, of books, of religion,\nwe admire their superiority; they seem to throw contempt\non our entire polity and social state; theirs is the tone\nof a youthful giant who is sent to work revolutions. But\nthey enter an active profession and the forming Colossus\nshrinks to the common size of man. The magic they used\nwas the ideal tendencies, which always make the Actual\nridiculous; but the tough world had its revenge the\nmoment they put their horses of the sun to plough in its\nfurrow. They found no example and no companion, and their\nheart fainted. What then? The lesson they gave in their\nfirst aspirations is yet true; and a better valor and a\npurer truth shall one day organize their belief. Or why\nshould a woman liken herself to any historical woman,\nand think, because Sappho, or Sevigne, or De Stael, or\nthe cloistered souls who have had genius and cultivation\ndo not satisfy the imagination and the serene Themis,\nnone can,—certainly not she? Why not? She has a new and\nunattempted problem to solve, perchance that of the\nhappiest nature that ever bloomed. Let the maiden, with\nerect soul, walk serenely on her way, accept the hint of\neach new experience, search in turn all the objects that\nsolicit her eye, that she may learn the power and the\ncharm of her new-born being, which is the kindling of a\nnew dawn in the recesses of space. The fair girl who\nrepels interference by a decided and proud choice of\ninfluences, so careless of pleasing, so wilful and lofty,\ninspires every beholder with somewhat of her own nobleness.\nThe silent heart encourages her; O friend, never strike\nsail to a fear! Come into port greatly, or sail with God\nthe seas. Not in vain you live, for every passing eye is\ncheered and refined by the vision.",
        "The characteristic of heroism is its persistency. All\nmen have wandering impulses, fits and starts of\ngenerosity. But when you have chosen your part, abide\nby it, and do not weakly try to reconcile yourself\nwith the world. The heroic cannot be the common, nor\nthe common the heroic. Yet we have the weakness to\nexpect the sympathy of people in those actions whose\nexcellence is that they outrun sympathy and appeal to\na tardy justice. If you would serve your brother,\nbecause it is fit for you to serve him, do not take\nback your words when you find that prudent people do\nnot commend you. Adhere to your own act, and congratulate\nyourself if you have done something strange and extravagant\nand broken the monotony of a decorous age. It was a high\ncounsel that I once heard given to a young person,—\"Always\ndo what you are afraid to do.” A simple manly character\nneed never make an apology, but should regard its past\naction with the calmness of Phocion, when he admitted that\nthe event of the battle was happy, yet did not regret his\ndissuasion from the battle.",
        "There is no weakness or exposure for which we cannot\nfind consolation in the thought—this is a part of my\nconstitution, part of my relation and office to my\nfellow-creature. Has nature covenanted with me that I\nshould never appear to disadvantage, never make a\nridiculous figure? Let us be generous of our dignity\nas well as of our money. Greatness once and for ever\nhas done with opinion. We tell our charities, not\nbecause we wish to be praised for them, not because we\nthink they have great merit, but for our justification.\nIt is a capital blunder; as you discover when another\nman recites his charities.",
        "To speak the truth, even with some austerity, to live\nwith some rigor of temperance, or some extremes of\ngenerosity, seems to be an asceticism which common\ngood-nature would appoint to those who are at ease and\nin plenty, in sign that they feel a brotherhood with\nthe great multitude of suffering men. And not only need\nwe breathe and exercise the soul by assuming the penalties\nof abstinence, of debt, of solitude, of unpopularity,—but\nit behooves the wise man to look with a bold eye into\nthose rarer dangers which sometimes invade men, and to\nfamiliarize himself with disgusting forms of disease, with\nsounds of execration, and the vision of violent death.",
        "Times of heroism are generally times of terror, but the\nday never shines in which this element may not work. The\ncircumstances of man, we say, are historically somewhat\nbetter in this country and at this hour than perhaps ever\nbefore. More freedom exists for culture. It will not now\nrun against an axe at the first step out of the beaten\ntrack of opinion. But whoso is heroic will always find\ncrises to try his edge. Human virtue demands her champions\nand martyrs, and the trial of persecution always proceeds.\nIt is but the other day that the brave Lovejoy gave his\nbreast to the bullets of a mob, for the rights of free\nspeech and opinion, and died when it was better not to\nlive.",
        "I see not any road of perfect peace which a man can walk,\nbut after the counsel of his own bosom. Let him quit too\nmuch association, let him go home much, and stablish\nhimself in those courses he approves.  The unremitting\nretention of simple and high sentiments in obscure duties\nis hardening the character to that temper which will work\nwith honor, if need be in the tumult, or on the scaffold.\nWhatever outrages have happened to men may befall a man\nagain; and very easily in a republic, if there appear any\nsigns of a decay of religion. Coarse slander, fire, tar\nand feathers and the gibbet, the youth may freely bring\nhome to his mind and with what sweetness of temper he can,\nand inquire how fast he can fix his sense of duty, braving\nsuch penalties, whenever it may please the next newspaper\nand a sufficient number of his neighbors to pronounce his\nopinions incendiary.",
        "It may calm the apprehension of calamity in the most\nsusceptible heart to see how quick a bound Nature has\nset to the utmost infliction of malice. We rapidly\napproach a brink over which no enemy can follow us:—",
        "In the gloom of our ignorance of what shall be, in the\nhour when we are deaf to the higher voices, who does\nnot envy those who have seen safely to an end their\nmanful endeavor? Who that sees the meanness of our\npolitics but inly congratulates Washington that he is\nlong already wrapped in his shroud, and for ever safe;\nthat he was laid sweet in his grave, the hope of humanity\nnot yet subjugated in him? Who does not sometimes envy\nthe good and brave who are no more to suffer from the\ntumults of the natural world, and await with curious\ncomplacency the speedy term of his own conversation with\nfinite nature?  And yet the love that will be annihilated\nsooner than treacherous has already made death impossible,\nand affirms itself no mortal but a native of the deeps of\nabsolute and inextinguishable being.",
        "THERE is a difference between one and another hour of\nlife in their authority and subsequent effect. Our faith\ncomes in moments; our vice is habitual. Yet there is a\ndepth in those brief moments which constrains us to\nascribe more reality to them than to all other experiences.\nFor this reason the argument which is always forthcoming\nto silence those who conceive extraordinary hopes of man,\nnamely the appeal to experience, is for ever invalid and\nvain. We give up the past to the objector, and yet we hope.\nHe must explain this hope. We grant that human life is mean,\nbut how did we find out that it was mean? What is the ground\nof this uneasiness of ours; of this old discontent? What is\nthe universal sense of want and ignorance, but the fine\ninnuendo by which the soul makes its enormous claim? Why\ndo men feel that the natural history of man has never been\nwritten, but he is always leaving behind what you have said\nof him, and it becomes old, and books of metaphysics\nworthless? The philosophy of six thousand years has not\nsearched the chambers and magazines of the soul. In its\nexperiments there has always remained, in the last analysis,\na residuum it could not resolve. Man is a stream whose\nsource is hidden. Our being is descending into us from\nwe know not whence. The most exact calculator has no\nprescience that somewhat incalculable may not balk the very\nnext moment. I am constrained every moment to acknowledge a\nhigher origin for events than the will I call mine.",
        "As with events, so is it with thoughts. When I watch\nthat flowing river, which, out of regions I see not,\npours for a season its streams into me, I see that I\nam a pensioner; not a cause, but a surprised spectator\nof this ethereal water; that I desire and look up and\nput myself in the attitude of reception, but from some\nalien energy the visions come.",
        "The Supreme Critic on the errors of the past and the\npresent, and the only prophet of that which must be,\nis that great nature in which we rest as the earth\nlies in the soft arms of the atmosphere; that Unity,\nthat Over-soul, within which every man’s particular\nbeing is contained and made one with all other; that\ncommon heart of which all sincere conversation is the\nworship, to which all right action is submission; that\noverpowering reality which confutes our tricks and\ntalents, and constrains every one to pass for what he\nis, and to speak from his character and not from his\ntongue, and which evermore tends to pass into our\nthought and hand and become wisdom and virtue and power\nand beauty. We live in succession, in division, in parts,\nin particles. Meantime within man is the soul of the\nwhole; the wise silence; the universal beauty, to which\nevery part and particle is equally related; the eternal\nONE. And this deep power in which we exist and whose\nbeatitude is all accessible to us, is not only self-\nsufficing and perfect in every hour, but the act of\nseeing and the thing seen, the seer and the spectacle,\nthe subject and the object, are one. We see the world\npiece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the\ntree; but the whole, of which these are the shining parts,\nis the soul. Only by the vision of that Wisdom can the\nhoroscope of the ages be read, and by falling back on our\nbetter thoughts, by yielding to the spirit of prophecy\nwhich is innate in every man, we can know what it saith.\nEvery man’s words who speaks from that life must sound\nvain to those who do not dwell in the same thought on\ntheir own part. I dare not speak for it. My words do not\ncarry its august sense; they fall short and cold. Only\nitself can inspire whom it will, and behold! their speech\nshall be lyrical, and sweet, and universal as the rising\nof the wind.  Yet I desire, even by profane words, if I\nmay not use sacred, to indicate the heaven of this deity\nand to report what hints I have collected of the\ntranscendent simplicity and energy of the Highest Law.",
        "If we consider what happens in conversation, in reveries,\nin remorse, in times of passion, in surprises, in the\ninstructions of dreams, wherein often we see ourselves\nin masquerade,—the droll disguises only magnifying and\nenhancing a real element and forcing it on our distinct\nnotice,—we shall catch many hints that will broaden and\nlighten into knowledge of the secret of nature. All goes\nto show that the soul in man is not an organ, but animates\nand exercises all the organs; is not a function, like the\npower of memory, of calculation, of comparison, but uses\nthese as hands and feet; is not a faculty, but a light;\nis not the intellect or the will, but the master of the\nintellect and the will; is the background of our being,\nin which they lie,—an immensity not possessed and that\ncannot be possessed. From within or from behind, a light\nshines through us upon things and makes us aware that we\nare nothing, but the light is all. A man is the facade of\na temple wherein all wisdom and all good abide. What we\ncommonly call man, the eating, drinking, planting, counting\nman, does not, as we know him, represent himself, but\nmisrepresents himself. Him we do not respect, but the soul,\nwhose organ he is, would he let it appear through his\naction, would make our knees bend. When it breathes through\nhis intellect, it is genius; when it breathes through his\nwill, it is virtue; when it flows through his affection, it\nis love. And the blindness of the intellect begins when it\nwould be something of itself. The weakness of the will begins\nwhen the individual would be something of himself. All reform\naims in some one particular to let the soul have its way\nthrough us; in other words, to engage us to obey.",
        "Of this pure nature every man is at some time sensible.\nLanguage cannot paint it with his colors. It is too\nsubtile. It is undefinable, unmeasurable; but we know\nthat it pervades and contains us. We know that all\nspiritual being is in man. A wise old proverb says, “God\ncomes to see us without bell;” that is, as there is no\nscreen or ceiling between our heads and the infinite\nheavens, so is there no bar or wall in the soul where\nman, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins. The\nwalls are taken away. We lie open on one side to the deeps\nof spiritual nature, to the attributes of God. Justice we\nsee and know, Love, Freedom, Power. These natures no man\never got above, but they tower over us, and most in the\nmoment when our interests tempt us to wound them.",
        "The sovereignty of this nature whereof we speak is made\nknown by its independency of those limitations which\ncircumscribe us on every hand. The soul circumscribes\nall things. As I have said, it contradicts all experience.\nIn like manner it abolishes time and space. The influence\nof the senses has in most men overpowered the mind to that\ndegree that the walls of time and space have come to look\nreal and insurmountable; and to speak with levity of these\nlimits is, in the world, the sign of insanity. Yet time and\nspace are but inverse measures of the force of the soul.\nThe spirit sports with time,—",
        "We are often made to feel that there is another youth\nand age than that which is measured from the year of\nour natural birth. Some thoughts always find us young,\nand keep us so. Such a thought is the love of the\nuniversal and eternal beauty. Every man parts from that\ncontemplation with the feeling that it rather belongs\nto ages than to mortal life. The least activity of the\nintellectual powers redeems us in a degree from the\nconditions of time. In sickness, in languor, give us a\nstrain of poetry or a profound sentence, and we are\nrefreshed; or produce a volume of Plato or Shakspeare,\nor remind us of their names, and instantly we come into\na feeling of longevity. See how the deep divine thought\nreduces centuries and millenniums and makes itself\npresent through all ages. Is the teaching of Christ\nless effective now than it was when first his mouth\nwas opened? The emphasis of facts and persons in my\nthought has nothing to do with time. And so always the\nsoul’s scale is one, the scale of the senses and the\nunderstanding is another. Before the revelations of the\nsoul, Time, Space and Nature shrink away. In common\nspeech we refer all things to time, as we habitually\nrefer the immensely sundered stars to one concave sphere.\nAnd so we say that the Judgment is distant or near, that\nthe Millennium approaches, that a day of certain political,\nmoral, social reforms is at hand, and the like, when we\nmean that in the nature of things one of the facts we\ncontemplate is external and fugitive, and the other is\npermanent and connate with the soul. The things we now\nesteem fixed shall, one by one, detach themselves like\nripe fruit from our experience, and fall. The wind shall\nblow them none knows whither. The landscape, the figures,\nBoston, London, are facts as fugitive as any institution\npast, or any whiff of mist or smoke, and so is society,\nand so is the world. The soul looketh steadily forwards,\ncreating a world before her, leaving worlds behind her.\nShe has no dates, nor rites, nor persons, nor specialties\nnor men. The soul knows only the soul; the web of events\nis the flowing robe in which she is clothed.",
        "After its own law and not by arithmetic is the rate of\nits progress to be computed. The soul’s advances are not\nmade by gradation, such as can be represented by motion\nin a straight line, but rather by ascension of state,\nsuch as can be represented by metamorphosis,—from the\negg to the worm, from the worm to the fly. The growths\nof genius are of a certain total character, that does\nnot advance the elect individual first over John, then\nAdam, then Richard, and give to each the pain of\ndiscovered inferiority,—but by every throe of growth\nthe man expands there where he works, passing, at each\npulsation, classes, populations, of men. With each divine\nimpulse the mind rends the thin rinds of the visible and\nfinite, and comes out into eternity, and inspires and\nexpires its air. It converses with truths that have always\nbeen spoken in the world, and becomes conscious of a closer\nsympathy with Zeno and Arrian than with persons in the house.",
        "This is the law of moral and of mental gain. The simple\nrise as by specific levity not into a particular virtue,\nbut into the region of all the virtues. They are in the\nspirit which contains them all. The soul requires purity,\nbut purity is not it; requires justice, but justice is\nnot that; requires beneficence, but is somewhat better;\nso that there is a kind of descent and accommodation felt\nwhen we leave speaking of moral nature to urge a virtue\nwhich it enjoins. To the well-born child all the virtues\nare natural, and not painfully acquired. Speak to his\nheart, and the man becomes suddenly virtuous.",
        "Within the same sentiment is the germ of intellectual\ngrowth, which obeys the same law. Those who are capable\nof humility, of justice, of love, of aspiration, stand\nalready on a platform that commands the sciences and\narts, speech and poetry, action and grace. For whoso\ndwells in this moral beatitude already anticipates those\nspecial powers which men prize so highly. The lover has\nno talent, no skill, which passes for quite nothing with\nhis enamoured maiden, however little she may possess of\nrelated faculty; and the heart which abandons itself to\nthe Supreme Mind finds itself related to all its works,\nand will travel a royal road to particular knowledges and\npowers. In ascending to this primary and aboriginal\nsentiment we have come from our remote station on the\ncircumference instantaneously to the centre of the world,\nwhere, as in the closet of God, we see causes, and\nanticipate the universe, which is but a slow effect.",
        "One mode of the divine teaching is the incarnation of\nthe spirit in a form,—in forms, like my own. I live\nin society, with persons who answer to thoughts in my\nown mind, or express a certain obedience to the great\ninstincts to which I live. I see its presence to them.\nI am certified of a common nature; and these other souls,\nthese separated selves, draw me as nothing else can.\nThey stir in me the new emotions we call passion; of love,\nhatred, fear, admiration, pity; thence come conversation,\ncompetition, persuasion, cities and war. Persons are\nsupplementary to the primary teaching of the soul. In\nyouth we are mad for persons. Childhood and youth see\nall the world in them. But the larger experience of man\ndiscovers the identical nature appearing through them all.\nPersons themselves acquaint us with the impersonal. In all\nconversation between two persons tacit reference is made,\nas to a third party, to a common nature. That third party\nor common nature is not social; it is impersonal; is God.\nAnd so in groups where debate is earnest, and especially\non high questions, the company become aware that the\nthought rises to an equal level in all bosoms, that all\nhave a spiritual property in what was said, as well as\nthe sayer. They all become wiser than they were. It arches\nover them like a temple, this unity of thought in which\nevery heart beats with nobler sense of power and duty, and\nthinks and acts with unusual solemnity. All are conscious\nof attaining to a higher self-possession. It shines for\nall. There is a certain wisdom of humanity which is common\nto the greatest men with the lowest, and which our ordinary\neducation often labors to silence and obstruct. The mind is\none, and the best minds, who love truth for its own sake,\nthink much less of property in truth. They accept it\nthankfully everywhere, and do not label or stamp it with\nany man’s name, for it is theirs long beforehand, and from\neternity. The learned and the studious of thought have no\nmonopoly of wisdom. Their violence of direction in some\ndegree disqualifies them to think truly.  We owe many\nvaluable observations to people who are not very acute or\nprofound, and who say the thing without effort which we want\nand have long been hunting in vain. The action of the soul\nis oftener in that which is felt and left unsaid than in\nthat which is said in any conversation. It broods over every\nsociety, and they unconsciously seek for it in each other.\nWe know better than we do. We do not yet possess ourselves,\nand we know at the same time that we are much more. I feel\nthe same truth how often in my trivial conversation with my\nneighbors, that somewhat higher in each of us overlooks this\nby-play, and Jove nods to Jove from behind each of us.",
        "Men descend to meet. In their habitual and mean service\nto the world, for which they forsake their native\nnobleness, they resemble those Arabian sheiks who dwell\nin mean houses and affect an external poverty, to escape\nthe rapacity of the Pacha, and reserve all their display\nof wealth for their interior and guarded retirements.",
        "As it is present in all persons, so it is in every\nperiod of life. It is adult already in the infant man.\nIn my dealing with my child, my Latin and Greek, my\naccomplishments and my money stead me nothing; but as\nmuch soul as I have avails. If I am wilful, he sets his\nwill against mine, one for one, and leaves me, if I\nplease, the degradation of beating him by my superiority\nof strength. But if I renounce my will and act for the\nsoul, setting that up as umpire between us two, out of\nhis young eyes looks the same soul; he reveres and loves\nwith me.",
        "The soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth. We know\ntruth when we see it, let skeptic and scoffer say what\nthey choose. Foolish people ask you, when you have spoken\nwhat they do not wish to hear, ’How do you know it is\ntruth, and not an error of your own?’ We know truth when\nwe see it, from opinion, as we know when we are awake that\nwe are awake. It was a grand sentence of Emanuel Swedenborg,\nwhich would alone indicate the greatness of that man’s\nperception,—\"It is no proof of a man’s understanding to\nbe able to confirm whatever he pleases; but to be able to\ndiscern that what is true is true, and that what is false\nis false,—this is the mark and character of intelligence.\"\nIn the book I read, the good thought returns to me, as\nevery truth will, the image of the whole soul. To the bad\nthought which I find in it, the same soul becomes a\ndiscerning, separating sword, and lops it away. We are wiser\nthan we know. If we will not interfere with our thought, but\nwill act entirely, or see how the thing stands in God, we\nknow the particular thing, and every thing, and every man.\nFor the Maker of all things and all persons stands behind\nus and casts his dread omniscience through us over things.",
        "But beyond this recognition of its own in particular\npassages of the individual’s experience, it also reveals\ntruth. And here we should seek to reinforce ourselves by\nits very presence, and to speak with a worthier, loftier\nstrain of that advent. For the soul’s communication of\ntruth is the highest event in nature, since it then does\nnot give somewhat from itself, but it gives itself, or\npasses into and becomes that man whom it enlightens; or,\nin proportion to that truth he receives, it takes him to\nitself.",
        "We distinguish the announcements of the soul, its\nmanifestations of its own nature, by the term Revelation.\nThese are always attended by the emotion of the sublime.\nFor this communication is an influx of the Divine mind\ninto our mind. It is an ebb of the individual rivulet\nbefore the flowing surges of the sea of life. Every distinct\napprehension of this central commandment agitates men with\nawe and delight. A thrill passes through all men at the\nreception of new truth, or at the performance of a great\naction, which comes out of the heart of nature. In these\ncommunications the power to see is not separated from the\nwill to do, but the insight proceeds from obedience, and\nthe obedience proceeds from a joyful perception. Every\nmoment when the individual feels himself invaded by it is\nmemorable. By the necessity of our constitution a certain\nenthusiasm attends the individual’s consciousness of that\ndivine presence. The character and duration of this\nenthusiasm varies with the state of the individual, from an\necstasy and trance and prophetic inspiration,—which is its\nrarer appearance,—to the faintest glow of virtuous emotion,\nin which form it warms, like our household fires, all the\nfamilies and associations of men, and makes society possible.\nA certain tendency to insanity has always attended the opening\nof the religious sense in men, as if they had been “blasted\nwith excess of light.” The trances of Socrates, the “union\"\nof Plotinus, the vision of Porphyry, the conversion of Paul,\nthe aurora of Behmen, the convulsions of George Fox and his\nQuakers, the illumination of Swedenborg, are of this kind.\nWhat was in the case of these remarkable persons a ravishment,\nhas, in innumerable instances in common life, been exhibited\nin less striking manner. Everywhere the history of religion\nbetrays a tendency to enthusiasm.  The rapture of the Moravian\nand Quietist; the opening of the internal sense of the Word,\nin the language of the New Jerusalem Church; the revival of\nthe Calvinistic churches; the experiences of the Methodists,\nare varying forms of that shudder of awe and delight with\nwhich the individual soul always mingles with the universal\nsoul.",
        "The nature of these revelations is the same; they are\nperceptions of the absolute law. They are solutions\nof the soul’s own questions. They do not answer the\nquestions which the understanding asks. The soul\nanswers never by words, but by the thing itself that\nis inquired after.",
        "Revelation is the disclosure of the soul. The popular\nnotion of a revelation is that it is a telling of\nfortunes. In past oracles of the soul the understanding\nseeks to find answers to sensual questions, and undertakes\nto tell from God how long men shall exist, what their\nhands shall do and who shall be their company, adding\nnames and dates and places. But we must pick no locks.\nWe must check this low curiosity. An answer in words is\ndelusive; it is really no answer to the questions you ask.\nDo not require a description of the countries towards\nwhich you sail. The description does not describe them to\nyou, and to-morrow you arrive there and know them by\ninhabiting them. Men ask concerning the immortality of\nthe soul, the employments of heaven, the state of the\nsinner, and so forth. They even dream that Jesus has left\nreplies to precisely these interrogatories. Never a moment\ndid that sublime spirit speak in their patois. To truth,\njustice, love, the attributes of the soul, the idea of\nimmutableness is essentially associated. Jesus, living in\nthese moral sentiments, heedless of sensual fortunes, heeding\nonly the manifestations of these, never made the separation\nof the idea of duration from the essence of these attributes,\nnor uttered a syllable concerning the duration of the soul.\nIt was left to his disciples to sever duration from the\nmoral elements, and to teach the immortality of the soul\nas a doctrine, and maintain it by evidences. The moment the\ndoctrine of the immortality is separately taught, man is\nalready fallen. In the flowing of love, in the adoration of\nhumility, there is no question of continuance. No inspired\nman ever asks this question or condescends to these evidences.\nFor the soul is true to itself, and the man in whom it is\nshed abroad cannot wander from the present, which is infinite,\nto a future which would be finite.",
        "These questions which we lust to ask about the future\nare a confession of sin. God has no answer for them. No\nanswer in words can reply to a question of things. It is\nnot in an arbitrary “decree of God,” but in the nature\nof man, that a veil shuts down on the facts of to-morrow;\nfor the soul will not have us read any other cipher than\nthat of cause and effect. By this veil which curtains\nevents it instructs the children of men to live in to-day.\nThe only mode of obtaining an answer to these questions\nof the senses is to forego all low curiosity, and,\naccepting the tide of being which floats us into the\nsecret of nature, work and live, work and live, and all\nunawares the advancing soul has built and forged for\nitself a new condition, and the question and the answer\nare one.",
        "By the same fire, vital, consecrating, celestial, which\nburns until it shall dissolve all things into the waves\nand surges of an ocean of light, we see and know each\nother, and what spirit each is of. Who can tell the\ngrounds of his knowledge of the character of the several\nindividuals in his circle of friends? No man. Yet their\nacts and words do not disappoint him. In that man, though\nhe knew no ill of him, he put no trust. In that other,\nthough they had seldom met, authentic signs had yet passed,\nto signify that he might be trusted as one who had an\ninterest in his own character. We know each other very well,\n—which of us has been just to himself and whether that\nwhich we teach or behold is only an aspiration or is our\nhonest effort also.",
        "We are all discerners of spirits. That diagnosis lies\naloft in our life or unconscious power. The intercourse\nof society, its trade, its religion, its friendships,\nits quarrels, is one wide, judicial investigation of\ncharacter. In full court, or in small committee, or\nconfronted face to face, accuser and accused, men offer\nthemselves to be judged. Against their will they exhibit\nthose decisive trifles by which character is read. But\nwho judges? and what? Not our understanding. We do not\nread them by learning or craft. No; the wisdom of the\nwise man consists herein, that he does not judge them;\nhe lets them judge themselves and merely reads and\nrecords their own verdict.",
        "By virtue of this inevitable nature, private will\nis overpowered, and, maugre our efforts or our\nimperfections, your genius will speak from you,\nand mine from me. That which we are, we shall teach,\nnot voluntarily but involuntarily. Thoughts come into\nour minds by avenues which we never left open, and\nthoughts go out of our minds through avenues which we\nnever voluntarily opened. Character teaches over our\nhead. The infallible index of true progress is found\nin the tone the man takes. Neither his age, nor his\nbreeding, nor company, nor books, nor actions, nor\ntalents, nor all together can hinder him from being\ndeferential to a higher spirit than his own. If he\nhave not found his home in God, his manners, his\nforms of speech, the turn of his sentences, the build,\nshall I say, of all his opinions will involuntarily\nconfess it, let him brave it out how he will. If he\nhave found his centre, the Deity will shine through\nhim, through all the disguises of ignorance, of\nungenial temperament, of unfavorable circumstance.\nThe tone of seeking is one, and the tone of having\nis another.",
        "The great distinction between teachers sacred or\nliterary,—between poets like Herbert, and poets\nlike Pope,—between philosophers like Spinoza, Kant\nand Coleridge, and philosophers like Locke, Paley,\nMackintosh and Stewart,—between men of the world\nwho are reckoned accomplished talkers, and here and\nthere a fervent mystic, prophesying half insane under\nthe infinitude of his thought,—is that one class\nspeak from within, or from experience, as parties\nand possessors of the fact; and the other class from\nwithout, as spectators merely, or perhaps as acquainted\nwith the fact on the evidence of third persons. It is\nof no use to preach to me from without. I can do that\ntoo easily myself. Jesus speaks always from within,\nand in a degree that transcends all others. In that is\nthe miracle. I believe beforehand that it ought so to\nbe. All men stand continually in the expectation of the\nappearance of such a teacher.  But if a man do not speak\nfrom within the veil, where the word is one with that it\ntells of, let him lowly confess it.",
        "The same Omniscience flows into the intellect, and makes\nwhat we call genius. Much of the wisdom of the world is\nnot wisdom, and the most illuminated class of men are no\ndoubt superior to literary fame, and are not writers.\nAmong the multitude of scholars and authors, we feel no\nhallowing presence; we are sensible of a knack and skill\nrather than of inspiration; they have a light and know\nnot whence it comes and call it their own; their talent\nis some exaggerated faculty, some overgrown member, so\nthat their strength is a disease. In these instances the\nintellectual gifts do not make the impression of virtue,\nbut almost of vice; and we feel that a man’s talents stand\nin the way of his advancement in truth. But genius is\nreligious. It is a larger imbibing of the common heart.\nIt is not anomalous, but more like and not less like other\nmen. There is in all great poets a wisdom of humanity\nwhich is superior to any talents they exercise. The author,\nthe wit, the partisan, the fine gentleman, does not take\nplace of the man. Humanity shines in Homer, in Chaucer, in\nSpenser, in Shakspeare, in Milton. They are content with\ntruth. They use the positive degree. They seem frigid and\nphlegmatic to those who have been spiced with the frantic\npassion and violent coloring of inferior but popular\nwriters. For they are poets by the free course which they\nallow to the informing soul, which through their eyes\nbeholds again and blesses the things which it hath made.\nThe soul is superior to its knowledge, wiser than any of\nits works. The great poet makes us feel our own wealth,\nand then we think less of his compositions. His best\ncommunication to our mind is to teach us to despise all\nhe has done. Shakspeare carries us to such a lofty strain\nof intelligent activity as to suggest a wealth which\nbeggars his own; and we then feel that the splendid works\nwhich he has created, and which in other hours we extol\nas a sort of self-existent poetry, take no stronger hold\nof real nature than the shadow of a passing traveller on\nthe rock. The inspiration which uttered itself in Hamlet\nand Lear could utter things as good from day to day for\never. Why then should I make account of Hamlet and Lear,\nas if we had not the soul from which they fell as syllables\nfrom the tongue?",
        "This energy does not descend into individual life on\nany other condition than entire possession. It comes\nto the lowly and simple; it comes to whomsoever will\nput off what is foreign and proud; it comes as insight;\nit comes as serenity and grandeur. When we see those\nwhom it inhabits, we are apprised of new degrees of\ngreatness. From that inspiration the man comes back\nwith a changed tone. He does not talk with men with\nan eye to their opinion. He tries them. It requires\nof us to be plain and true. The vain traveller attempts\nto embellish his life by quoting my lord and the prince\nand the countess, who thus said or did to him. The\nambitious vulgar show you their spoons and brooches and\nrings, and preserve their cards and compliments. The\nmore cultivated, in their account of their own experience,\ncull out the pleasing, poetic circumstance,—the visit to\nRome, the man of genius they saw, the brilliant friend\nThey know; still further on perhaps the gorgeous landscape,\nthe mountain lights, the mountain thoughts they enjoyed\nyesterday,—and so seek to throw a romantic color over\ntheir life. But the soul that ascends to worship the\ngreat God is plain and true; has no rose-color, no fine\nfriends, no chivalry, no adventures; does not want\nadmiration; dwells in the hour that now is, in the\nearnest experience of the common day,—by reason of the\npresent moment and the mere trifle having become porous\nto thought and bibulous of the sea of light.",
        "Converse with a mind that is grandly simple, and\nliterature looks like word-catching. The simplest\nutterances are worthiest to be written, yet are\nthey so cheap and so things of course, that in the\ninfinite riches of the soul it is like gathering a\nfew pebbles off the ground, or bottling a little\nair in a phial, when the whole earth and the whole\natmosphere are ours. Nothing can pass there, or make\nyou one of the circle, but the casting aside your\ntrappings, and dealing man to man in naked truth,\nplain confession, and omniscient affirmation.",
        "Souls such as these treat you as gods would, walk as\ngods in the earth, accepting without any admiration\nyour wit, your bounty, your virtue even,—say rather\nyour act of duty, for your virtue they own as their\nproper blood, royal as themselves, and over-royal,\nand the father of the gods. But what rebuke their\nplain fraternal bearing casts on the mutual flattery\nwith which authors solace each other and wound\nthemselves! These flatter not. I do not wonder that\nthese men go to see Cromwell and Christina and Charles\nthe Second and James the First and the Grand Turk. For\nthey are, in their own elevation, the fellows of kings,\nand must feel the servile tone of conversation in the\nworld. They must always be a godsend to princes, for\nthey confront them, a king to a king, without ducking\nor concession, and give a high nature the refreshment\nand satisfaction of resistance, of plain humanity, of\neven companionship and of new ideas. They leave them\nwiser and superior men. Souls like these make us feel\nthat sincerity is more excellent than flattery. Deal so\nplainly with man and woman as to constrain the utmost\nsincerity and destroy all hope of trifling with you. It\nis the highest compliment you can pay. Their “highest\npraising,” said Milton, “is not flattery, and their\nplainest advice is a kind of praising.”",
        "Ineffable is the union of man and God in every act\nof the soul. The simplest person who in his integrity\nworships God, becomes God; yet for ever and ever the\ninflux of this better and universal self is new and\nunsearchable. It inspires awe and astonishment. How\ndear, how soothing to man, arises the idea of God,\npeopling the lonely place, effacing the scars of our\nmistakes and disappointments! When we have broken our\ngod of tradition and ceased from our god of rhetoric,\nthen may God fire the heart with his presence. It is\nthe doubling of the heart itself, nay, the infinite\nenlargement of the heart with a power of growth to a\nnew infinity on every side. It inspires in man an\ninfallible trust. He has not the conviction, but the\nsight, that the best is the true, and may in that\nthought easily dismiss all particular uncertainties\nand fears, and adjourn to the sure revelation of time\nthe solution of his private riddles. He is sure that\nhis welfare is dear to the heart of being. In the\npresence of law to his mind he is overflowed with a\nreliance so universal that it sweeps away all cherished\nhopes and the most stable projects of mortal condition\nin its flood. He believes that he cannot escape from\nhis good. The things that are really for thee gravitate\nto thee. You are running to seek your friend. Let your\nfeet run, but your mind need not. If you do not find\nhim, will you not acquiesce that it is best you should\nnot find him? for there is a power, which, as it is in\nyou, is in him also, and could therefore very well bring\nyou together, if it were for the best. You are preparing\nwith eagerness to go and render a service to which your\ntalent and your taste invite you, the love of men and\nthe hope of fame. Has it not occurred to you that you\nhave no right to go, unless you are equally willing to\nbe prevented from going? O, believe, as thou livest, that\nevery sound that is spoken over the round world, which\nthou oughtest to hear, will vibrate on thine ear! Every\nproverb, every book, every byword that belongs to thee\nfor aid or comfort, shall surely come home through open\nor winding passages. Every friend whom not thy fantastic\nwill but the great and tender heart in thee craveth,\nshall lock thee in his embrace. And this because the\nheart in thee is the heart of all; not a valve, not a\nwall, not an intersection is there anywhere in nature,\nbut one blood rolls uninterruptedly an endless circulation\nthrough all men, as the water of the globe is all one sea,\nand, truly seen, its tide is one.",
        "Let man then learn the revelation of all nature and\nall thought to his heart; this, namely; that the\nHighest dwells with him; that the sources of nature\nare in his own mind, if the sentiment of duty is\nthere. But if he would know what the great God\nspeaketh, he must ’go into his closet and shut the\ndoor,’ as Jesus said. God will not make himself\nmanifest to cowards. He must greatly listen to himself,\nwithdrawing himself from all the accents of other men’s\ndevotion. Even their prayers are hurtful to him, until\nhe have made his own. Our religion vulgarly stands on\nnumbers of believers. Whenever the appeal is made,—no\nmatter how indirectly,—to numbers, proclamation is then\nand there made that religion is not. He that finds God a\nsweet enveloping thought to him never counts his company.\nWhen I sit in that presence, who shall dare to come in?\nWhen I rest in perfect humility, when I burn with pure\nlove, what can Calvin or Swedenborg say?",
        "It makes no difference whether the appeal is to\nnumbers or to one. The faith that stands on authority\nis not faith. The reliance on authority measures the\ndecline of religion, the withdrawal of the soul. The\nposition men have given to Jesus, now for many centuries\nof history, is a position of authority. It characterizes\nthemselves. It cannot alter the eternal facts. Great is\nthe soul, and plain. It is no flatterer, it is no\nfollower; it never appeals from itself. It believes in\nitself. Before the immense possibilities of man all mere\nexperience, all past biography, however spotless and\nsainted, shrinks away. Before that heaven which our\npresentiments foreshow us, we cannot easily praise any\nform of life we have seen or read of.  We not only affirm\nthat we have few great men, but, absolutely speaking,\nthat we have none; that we have no history, no record of\nany character or mode of living that entirely contents\nus. The saints and demigods whom history worships we are\nconstrained to accept with a grain of allowance. Though\nin our lonely hours we draw a new strength out of their\nmemory, yet, pressed on our attention, as they are by\nthe thoughtless and customary, they fatigue and invade.\nThe soul gives itself, alone, original and pure, to the\nLonely, Original and Pure, who, on that condition, gladly\ninhabits, leads and speaks through it. Then is it glad,\nyoung and nimble. It is not wise, but it sees through all\nthings. It is not called religious, but it is innocent.\nIt calls the light its own, and feels that the grass grows\nand the stone falls by a law inferior to, and dependent\non, its nature. Behold, it saith, I am born into the great,\nthe universal mind. I, the imperfect, adore my own Perfect.\nI am somehow receptive of the great soul, and thereby I do\nOverlook the sun and the stars and feel them to be the fair\naccidents and effects which change and pass. More and more\nthe surges of everlasting nature enter into me, and I\nbecome public and human in my regards and actions. So come\nI to live in thoughts and act with energies which are\nimmortal. Thus revering the soul, and learning, as the\nancient said, that “its beauty is immense,” man will come\nto see that the world is the perennial miracle which the\nsoul worketh, and be less astonished at particular wonders;\nhe will learn that there is no profane history; that all\nhistory is sacred; that the universe is represented in an\natom, in a moment of time. He will weave no longer a spotted\nlife of shreds and patches, but he will live with a divine\nunity. He will cease from what is base and frivolous in his\nlife and be content with all places and with any service he\ncan render. He will calmly front the morrow in the negligency\nof that trust which carries God with it and so hath already\nthe whole future in the bottom of the heart.",
        "The eye is the first circle; the horizon which it\nforms is the second; and throughout nature this\nprimary figure is repeated without end. It is the\nhighest emblem in the cipher of the world. St.\nAugustine described the nature of God as a circle\nwhose centre was everywhere and its circumference\nnowhere.  We are all our lifetime reading the copious\nsense of this first of forms. One moral we have already\ndeduced, in considering the circular or compensatory\ncharacter of every human action. Another analogy we\nshall now trace, that every action admits of being\noutdone. Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth\nthat around every circle another can be drawn; that\nthere is no end in nature, but every end is a beginning;\nthat there is always another dawn risen on mid-noon,\nand under every deep a lower deep opens.",
        "This fact, as far as it symbolizes the moral fact of\nthe Unattainable, the flying Perfect, around which the\nhands of man can never meet, at once the inspirer and\nthe condemner of every success, may conveniently serve\nus to connect many illustrations of human power in\nevery department.",
        "There are no fixtures in nature. The universe is\nfluid and volatile. Permanence is but a word of\ndegrees.  Our globe seen by God is a transparent\nlaw, not a mass of facts. The law dissolves the\nfact and holds it fluid. Our culture is the\npredominance of an idea which draws after it this\ntrain of cities and institutions.  Let us rise into\nanother idea: they will disappear. The Greek\nsculpture is all melted away, as if it had been\nstatues of ice; here and there a solitary figure or\nfragment remaining, as we see flecks and scraps of\nsnow left in cold dells and mountain clefts in June\nand July. For the genius that created it creates now\nsomewhat else. The Greek letters last a little longer,\nbut are already passing under the same sentence and\ntumbling into the inevitable pit which the creation\nof new thought opens for all that is old. The new\ncontinents are built out of the ruins of an old planet;\nthe new races fed out of the decomposition of the\nforegoing. New arts destroy the old. See the investment\nof capital in aqueducts made useless by hydraulics;\nfortifications, by gunpowder; roads and canals, by\nrailways; sails, by steam; steam by electricity.",
        "You admire this tower of granite, weathering the\nhurts of so many ages. Yet a little waving hand\nbuilt this huge wall, and that which builds is\nbetter than that which is built. The hand that\nbuilt can topple it down much faster. Better than\nthe hand and nimbler was the invisible thought\nwhich wrought through it; and thus ever, behind\nthe coarse effect, is a fine cause, which, being\nnarrowly seen, is itself the effect of a finer\ncause. Every thing looks permanent until its secret\nis known. A rich estate appears to women a firm and\nlasting fact; to a merchant, one easily created out\nof any materials, and easily lost. An orchard, good\ntillage, good grounds, seem a fixture, like a gold\nmine, or a river, to a citizen; but to a large farmer,\nnot much more fixed than the state of the crop. Nature\nlooks provokingly stable and secular, but it has a\ncause like all the rest; and when once I comprehend\nthat, will these fields stretch so immovably wide,\nthese leaves hang so individually considerable?\nPermanence is a word of degrees. Every thing is medial.\nMoons are no more bounds to spiritual power than bat-balls.",
        "The key to every man is his thought. Sturdy and defying\nthough he look, he has a helm which he obeys, which is\nthe idea after which all his facts are classified. He\ncan only be reformed by showing him a new idea which\ncommands his own. The life of man is a self-evolving\ncircle, which, from a ring imperceptibly small, rushes\non all sides outwards to new and larger circles, and\nthat without end. The extent to which this generation\nof circles, wheel without wheel, will go, depends on\nthe force or truth of the individual soul. For it is\nthe inert effort of each thought, having formed itself\ninto a circular wave of circumstance,—as for instance\nan empire, rules of an art, a local usage, a religious\nrite,—to heap itself on that ridge and to solidify and\nhem in the life. But if the soul is quick and strong it\nbursts over that boundary on all sides and expands\nanother orbit on the great deep, which also runs up into\na high wave, with attempt again to stop and to bind. But\nthe heart refuses to be imprisoned; in its first and\nnarrowest pulses, it already tends outward with a vast\nforce and to immense and innumerable expansions.",
        "Every ultimate fact is only the first of a new series.\nEvery general law only a particular fact of some more\ngeneral law presently to disclose itself. There is no\noutside, no inclosing wall, no circumference to us. The\nman finishes his story,—how good! how final! how it\nputs a new face on all things! He fills the sky. Lo!\non the other side rises also a man and draws a circle\naround the circle we had just pronounced the outline of\nthe sphere. Then already is our first speaker not man,\nbut only a first speaker. His only redress is forthwith\nto draw a circle outside of his antagonist. And so men\ndo by themselves. The result of to-day, which haunts the\nmind and cannot be escaped, will presently be abridged\ninto a word, and the principle that seemed to explain\nnature will itself be included as one example of a bolder\ngeneralization. In the thought of to-morrow there is a\npower to upheave all thy creed, all the creeds, all the\nliteratures of the nations, and marshal thee to a heaven\nwhich no epic dream has yet depicted.

But the\neye soon gets wonted to it, for the eye and it are\neffects of one cause; then its innocency and benefit\nappear, and presently, all its energy spent, it pales\nand dwindles before the revelation of the new hour.",

It now shows itself ethical and\npractical. We learn that God is; that he is in me; and\nthat all things are shadows of him.  The idealism of\nBerkeley is only a crude statement of the idealism of\nJesus, and that again is a crude statement of the fact\nthat all nature is the rapid efflux of goodness executing\nand organizing itself. Much more obviously is history and\nthe state of the world at any one time directly dependent\non the intellectual classification then existing in the\nminds of men. The things which are dear to men at this\nhour are so on account of the ideas which have emerged\non their mental horizon, and which cause the present order\nof things, as a tree bears its apples. A new degree of\nculture would instantly revolutionize the entire system\nof human pursuits.",
        "Conversation is a game of circles. In conversation\nwe pluck up the termini which bound the common of\nsilence on every side. The parties are not to be\njudged by the spirit they partake and even express\nunder this Pentecost. To-morrow they will have receded\nfrom this high-water mark. To-morrow you shall find\nthem stooping under the old pack-saddles. Yet let us\nenjoy the cloven flame whilst it glows on our walls.\nWhen each new speaker strikes a new light, emancipates\nus from the oppression of the last speaker, to oppress\nus with the greatness and exclusiveness of his own\nthought, then yields us to another redeemer, we seem\nto recover our rights, to become men. O, what truths\nprofound and executable only in ages and orbs, are\nsupposed in the announcement of every truth! In common\nhours, society sits cold and statuesque. We all stand\nwaiting, empty,—knowing, possibly, that we can be full,\nsurrounded by mighty symbols which are not symbols to\nus, but prose and trivial toys. Then cometh the god and\nconverts the statues into fiery men, and by a flash of\nhis eye burns up the veil which shrouded all things,\nand the meaning of the very furniture, of cup and saucer,\nof chair and clock and tester, is manifest. The facts\nwhich loomed so large in the fogs of yesterday,—property,\nclimate, breeding, personal beauty and the like, have\nstrangely changed their proportions. All that we reckoned\nsettled shakes and rattles; and literatures, cities,\nclimates, religions, leave their foundations and dance\nbefore our eyes. And yet here again see the swift\ncircumspection! Good as is discourse, silence is better,\nand shames it. The length of the discourse indicates the\ndistance of thought betwixt the speaker and the hearer.\nIf they were at a perfect understanding in any part, no\nwords would be necessary thereon. If at one in all parts,\nno words would be suffered.",
        "Literature is a point outside of our hodiernal circle\nthrough which a new one may be described. The use of\nliterature is to afford us a platform whence we may\ncommand a view of our present life, a purchase by\nwhich we may move it. We fill ourselves with ancient\nlearning, install ourselves the best we can in Greek,\nin Punic, in Roman houses, only that we may wiselier\nsee French, English and American houses and modes of\nliving. In like manner we see literature best from the\nmidst of wild nature, or from the din of affairs, or\nfrom a high religion. The field cannot be well seen\nfrom within the field. The astronomer must have his\ndiameter of the earth’s orbit as a base to find the\nparallax of any star.",
        "Therefore we value the poet. All the argument and all\nthe wisdom is not in the encyclopaedia, or the treatise\non metaphysics, or the Body of Divinity, but in the\nsonnet or the play. In my daily work I incline to repeat\nmy old steps, and do not believe in remedial force, in\nthe power of change and reform. But some Petrarch or\nAriosto, filled with the new wine of his imagination,\nwrites me an ode or a brisk romance, full of daring\nthought and action. He smites and arouses me with his\nshrill tones, breaks up my whole chain of habits, and\nI open my eye on my own possibilities. He claps wings\nto the sides of all the solid old lumber of the world,\nand I am capable once more of choosing a straight path\nin theory and practice.",
        "We have the same need to command a view of the religion\nof the world. We can never see Christianity from the\ncatechism:—from the pastures, from a boat in the pond,\nfrom amidst the songs of wood-birds we possibly may.\nCleansed by the elemental light and wind, steeped in the\nsea of beautiful forms which the field offers us, we may\nchance to cast a right glance back upon biography.\nChristianity is rightly dear to the best of mankind; yet\nwas there never a young philosopher whose breeding had\nfallen into the Christian church by whom that brave text\nof Paul’s was not specially prized:—\"Then shall also the\nSon be subject unto Him who put all things under him, that\nGod may be all in all.” Let the claims and virtues of\npersons be never so great and welcome, the instinct of man\npresses eagerly onward to the impersonal and illimitable,\nand gladly arms itself against the dogmatism of bigots with\nthis generous word out of the book itself.",
        "The natural world may be conceived of as a system of\nconcentric circles, and we now and then detect in\nnature slight dislocations which apprise us that this\nsurface on which we now stand is not fixed, but sliding.\nThese manifold tenacious qualities, this chemistry and\nvegetation, these metals and animals, which seem to\nstand there for their own sake, are means and methods\nonly,—are words of God, and as fugitive as other words.\nHas the naturalist or chemist learned his craft, who\nhas explored the gravity of atoms and the elective\naffinities, who has not yet discerned the deeper law\nwhereof this is only a partial or approximate statement,\nnamely that like draws to like, and that the goods which\nbelong to you gravitate to you and need not be pursued\nwith pains and cost? Yet is that statement approximate\nalso, and not final. Omnipresence is a higher fact. Not\nthrough subtle subterranean channels need friend and fact\nbe drawn to their counterpart, but, rightly considered,\nthese things proceed from the eternal generation of the\nsoul. Cause and effect are two sides of one fact.",
        "The same law of eternal procession ranges all that\nwe call the virtues, and extinguishes each in the\nlight of a better. The great man will not be prudent\nin the popular sense; all his prudence will be so much\ndeduction from his grandeur. But it behooves each to\nsee, when he sacrifices prudence, to what god he\ndevotes it; if to ease and pleasure, he had better\nbe prudent still; if to a great trust, he can well\nspare his mule and panniers who has a winged chariot\ninstead. Geoffrey draws on his boots to go through\nthe woods, that his feet may be safer from the bite\nof snakes; Aaron never thinks of such a peril. In many\nyears neither is harmed by such an accident. Yet it\nseems to me that with every precaution you take against\nsuch an evil you put yourself into the power of the evil.\nI suppose that the highest prudence is the lowest prudence.\nIs this too sudden a rushing from the centre to the verge\nof our orbit? Think how many times we shall fall back into\npitiful calculations before we take up our rest in the\ngreat sentiment, or make the verge of to-day the new\ncentre. Besides, your bravest sentiment is familiar to\nthe humblest men. The poor and the low have their way of\nexpressing the last facts of philosophy as well as you.\n\"Blessed be nothing” and “The worse things are, the better\nthey are” are proverbs which express the transcendentalism\nof common life.",
        "One man’s justice is another’s injustice; one man’s\nbeauty another’s ugliness; one man’s wisdom another’s\nfolly; as one beholds the same objects from a higher\npoint. One man thinks justice consists in paying debts,\nand has no measure in his abhorrence of another who is\nvery remiss in this duty and makes the creditor wait\ntediously. But that second man has his own way of\nlooking at things; asks himself Which debt must I pay\nfirst, the debt to the rich, or the debt to the poor?\nthe debt of money, or the debt of thought to mankind,\nof genius to nature? For you, O broker, there is no\nother principle but arithmetic. For me, commerce is of\ntrivial import; love, faith, truth of character, the\naspiration of man, these are sacred; nor can I detach\none duty, like you, from all other duties, and concentrate\nmy forces mechanically on the payment of moneys. Let me\nlive onward; you shall find that, though slower, the\nprogress of my character will liquidate all these debts\nwithout injustice to higher claims. If a man should\ndedicate himself to the payment of notes, would not this\nbe injustice? Does he owe no debt but money? And are all\nclaims on him to be postponed to a landlord’s or a banker’s?",
        "There is no virtue which is final; all are initial.\nThe virtues of society are vices of the saint. The\nterror of reform is the discovery that we must cast\naway our virtues, or what we have always esteemed\nsuch, into the same pit that has consumed our grosser\nvices:—",
        "It is the highest power of divine moments that they\nabolish our contritions also. I accuse myself of sloth\nand unprofitableness day by day; but when these waves\nof God flow into me I no longer reckon lost time. I no\nlonger poorly compute my possible achievement by what\nremains to me of the month or the year; for these moments\nconfer a sort of omnipresence and omnipotence which asks\nnothing of duration, but sees that the energy of the mind\nis commensurate with the work to be done, without time.",
        "And thus, O circular philosopher, I hear some reader\nexclaim, you have arrived at a fine Pyrrhonism, at an\nequivalence and indifferency of all actions, and would\nfain teach us that if we are true, forsooth, our crimes\nmay be lively stones out of which we shall construct the\ntemple of the true God!",
        "I am not careful to justify myself. I own I am\ngladdened by seeing the predominance of the saccharine\nprinciple throughout vegetable nature, and not less by\nbeholding in morals that unrestrained inundation of\nthe principle of good into every chink and hole that\nselfishness has left open, yea into selfishness and sin\nitself; so that no evil is pure, nor hell itself without\nits extreme satisfactions. But lest I should mislead any\nwhen I have my own head and obey my whims, let me remind\nthe reader that I am only an experimenter.  Do not set\nthe least value on what I do, or the least discredit on\nwhat I do not, as if I pretended to settle any thing as\ntrue or false. I unsettle all things. No facts are to me\nsacred; none are profane; I simply experiment, an endless\nseeker with no Past at my back.",
        "Yet this incessant movement and progression which all\nthings partake could never become sensible to us but\nby contrast to some principle of fixture or stability\nin the soul. Whilst the eternal generation of circles\nproceeds, the eternal generator abides. That central\nlife is somewhat superior to creation, superior to\nknowledge and thought, and contains all its circles.\nFor ever it labors to create a life and thought as\nLarge and excellent as itself, but in vain, for that\nwhich is made instructs how to make a better.",
        "Thus there is no sleep, no pause, no preservation,\nbut all things renew, germinate and spring. Why\nshould we import rags and relics into the new hour?\nNature abhors the old, and old age seems the only\ndisease; all others run into this one. We call it by\nmany names,—fever, intemperance, insanity, stupidity\nand crime; they are all forms of old age; they are\nrest, conservatism, appropriation, inertia; not newness,\nnot the way onward. We grizzle every day. I see no need\nof it. Whilst we converse with what is above us, we do\nnot grow old, but grow young. Infancy, youth, receptive,\naspiring, with religious eye looking upward, counts\nitself nothing and abandons itself to the instruction\nflowing from all sides. But the man and woman of seventy\nassume to know all, they have outlived their hope, they\nrenounce aspiration, accept the actual for the necessary\nand talk down to the young. Let them, then, become organs\nof the Holy Ghost; let them be lovers; let them behold\ntruth; and their eyes are uplifted, their wrinkles smoothed,\nthey are perfumed again with hope and power. This old age\nought not to creep on a human mind. In nature every moment\nis new; the past is always swallowed and forgotten; the\ncoming only is sacred.  Nothing is secure but life,\ntransition, the energizing spirit. No love can be bound\nby oath or covenant to secure it against a higher love.\nNo truth so sublime but it may be trivial to-morrow in\nthe light of new thoughts. People wish to be settled; only\nas far as they are unsettled is there any hope for them.",
        "Life is a series of surprises. We do not guess to-day\nthe mood, the pleasure, the power of to-morrow, when we\nare building up our being. Of lower states, of acts of\nroutine and sense, we can tell somewhat; but the\nmasterpieces of God, the total growths and universal\nmovements of the soul, he hideth; they are incalculable.\nI can know that truth is divine and helpful; but how it\nshall help me I can have no guess, for so to be is the\nsole inlet of so to know. The new position of the\nadvancing man has all the powers of the old, yet has\nthem all new. It carries in its bosom all the energies\nof the past, yet is itself an exhalation of the morning.\nI cast away in this new moment all my once hoarded\nknowledge, as vacant and vain. Now, for the first time\nseem I to know any thing rightly. The simplest words,—we\ndo not know what they mean except when we love and aspire.",
        "The difference between talents and character is\nadroitness to keep the old and trodden round, and\npower and courage to make a new road to new and\nbetter goals. Character makes an overpowering present;\na cheerful, determined hour, which fortifies all the\ncompany by making them see that much is possible and\nexcellent that was not thought of. Character dulls\nthe impression of particular events. When we see the\nconqueror we do not think much of any one battle or\nsuccess. We see that we had exaggerated the difficulty.\nIt was easy to him. The great man is not convulsible or\ntormentable; events pass over him without much impression.\nPeople say sometimes, ’See what I have overcome; see how\ncheerful I am; see how completely I have triumphed over\nthese black events.’ Not if they still remind me of the\nblack event. True conquest is the causing the calamity\nto fade and disappear as an early cloud of insignificant\nresult in a history so large and advancing.",
        "The one thing which we seek with insatiable desire is to\nforget ourselves, to be surprised out of our propriety,\nto lose our sempiternal memory and to do something without\nknowing how or why; in short to draw a new circle. Nothing\ngreat was ever achieved without enthusiasm. The way of life\nis wonderful; it is by abandonment. The great moments of\nhistory are the facilities of performance through the\nstrength of ideas, as the works of genius and religion.\n\"A man” said Oliver Cromwell “never rises so high as when\nhe knows not whither he is going.” Dreams and drunkenness,\nthe use of opium and alcohol are the semblance and counterfeit\nof this oracular genius, and hence their dangerous attraction\nfor men. For the like reason they ask the aid of wild passions,\nas in gaming and war, to ape in some manner these flames and\ngenerosities of the heart.",
        "Every substance is negatively electric to that which\nstands above it in the chemical tables, positively to\nthat which stands below it. Water dissolves wood and\niron and salt; air dissolves water; electric fire\ndissolves air, but the intellect dissolves fire,\ngravity, laws, method, and the subtlest unnamed relations\nof nature in its resistless menstruum. Intellect lies\nbehind genius, which is intellect constructive. Intellect\nis the simple power anterior to all action or construction.\nGladly would I unfold in calm degrees a natural history of\nthe intellect, but what man has yet been able to mark the\nsteps and boundaries of that transparent essence? The first\nquestions are always to be asked, and the wisest doctor is\ngravelled by the inquisitiveness of a child. How can we\nspeak of the action of the mind under any divisions, as of\nits knowledge, of its ethics, of its works, and so forth,\nsince it melts will into perception, knowledge into act?\nEach becomes the other. Itself alone is. Its vision is not\nlike the vision of the eye, but is union with the things\nknown.",
        "Intellect and intellection signify to the common ear\nconsideration of abstract truth. The considerations of\ntime and place, of you and me, of profit and hurt\ntyrannize over most men’s minds. Intellect separates\nthe fact considered, from you, from all local and\npersonal reference, and discerns it as if it existed\nfor its own sake. Heraclitus looked upon the affections\nas dense and colored mists. In the fog of good and\nevil affections it is hard for man to walk forward in\na straight line. Intellect is void of affection and\nsees an object as it stands in the light of science,\ncool and disengaged. The intellect goes out of the\nindividual, floats over its own personality, and\nregards it as a fact, and not as I and mine. He who\nis immersed in what concerns person or place cannot\nsee the problem of existence. This the intellect always\nponders.  Nature shows all things formed and bound. The\nintellect pierces the form, overleaps the wall, detects\nintrinsic likeness between remote things and reduces all\nthings into a few principles.",
        "The making a fact the subject of thought raises it. All\nthat mass of mental and moral phenomena which we do not\nmake objects of voluntary thought, come within the power\nof fortune; they constitute the circumstance of daily\nlife; they are subject to change, to fear, and hope.\nEvery man beholds his human condition with a degree of\nmelancholy. As a ship aground is battered by the waves,\nso man, imprisoned in mortal life, lies open to the mercy\nof coming events. But a truth, separated by the intellect,\nis no longer a subject of destiny. We behold it as a god\nupraised above care and fear. And so any fact in our life,\nor any record of our fancies or reflections, disentangled\nfrom the web of our unconsciousness, becomes an object\nimpersonal and immortal. It is the past restored, but\nembalmed. A better art than that of Egypt has taken fear\nand corruption out of it. It is eviscerated of care. It\nis offered for science. What is addressed to us for\ncontemplation does not threaten us but makes us intellectual\nbeings.",
        "The growth of the intellect is spontaneous in every\nexpansion. The mind that grows could not predict the\ntimes, the means, the mode of that spontaneity. God\nenters by a private door into every individual. Long\nprior to the age of reflection is the thinking of the\nmind. Out of darkness it came insensibly into the\nmarvellous light of to-day. In the period of infancy it\naccepted and disposed of all impressions from the\nsurrounding creation after its own way. Whatever any mind\ndoth or saith is after a law; and this native law remains\nover it after it has come to reflection or conscious thought.\nIn the most worn, pedantic, introverted self-tormenter’s\nlife, the greatest part is incalculable by him, unforeseen,\nunimaginable, and must be, until he can take himself up by\nhis own ears. What am I? What has my will done to make me\nthat I am? Nothing. I have been floated into this thought,\nthis hour, this connection of events, by secret currents of\nmight and mind, and my ingenuity and wilfulness have not\nthwarted, have not aided to an appreciable degree.",
        "Our spontaneous action is always the best. You\ncannot with your best deliberation and heed come\nso close to any question as your spontaneous glance\nshall bring you, whilst you rise from your bed, or\nwalk abroad in the morning after meditating the\nmatter before sleep on the previous night. Our\nthinking is a pious reception. Our truth of thought\nis therefore vitiated as much by too violent direction\ngiven by our will, as by too great negligence. We do\nnot determine what we will think. We only open our\nsenses, clear away as we can all obstruction from the\nfact, and suffer the intellect to see. We have little\ncontrol over our thoughts. We are the prisoners of\nideas. They catch us up for moments into their heaven\nand so fully engage us that we take no thought for the\nmorrow, gaze like children, without an effort to make\nthem our own. By and by we fall out of that rapture,\nbethink us where we have been, what we have seen, and\nrepeat as truly as we can what we have beheld. As far\nas we can recall these ecstasies we carry away in the\nineffaceable memory the result, and all men and all the\nages confirm it. It is called Truth. But the moment we\ncease to report and attempt to correct and contrive, it\nis not truth.",
        "If we consider what persons have stimulated and\nprofited us, we shall perceive the superiority of\nthe spontaneous or intuitive principle over the\narithmetical or logical. The first contains the\nsecond, but virtual and latent. We want in every man\na long logic; we cannot pardon the absence of it, but\nit must not be spoken. Logic is the procession or\nproportionate unfolding of the intuition; but its\nvirtue is as silent method; the moment it would appear\nas propositions and have a separate value it is worthless.",
        "In every man’s mind, some images, words and facts\nremain, without effort on his part to imprint them,\nwhich others forget, and afterwards these illustrate\nto him important laws. All our progress is an unfolding,\nlike the vegetable bud. You have first an instinct, then\nan opinion, then a knowledge, as the plant has root, bud\nand fruit. Trust the instinct to the end, though you can\nrender no reason. It is vain to hurry it. By trusting it\nto the end, it shall ripen into truth and you shall know\nwhy you believe.",
        "Each mind has its own method. A true man never\nacquires after college rules. What you have aggregated\nin a natural manner surprises and delights when it is\nproduced. For we cannot oversee each other’s secret.\nAnd hence the differences between men in natural endowment\nare insignificant in comparison with their common wealth.\nDo you think the porter and the cook have no anecdotes,\nno experiences, no wonders for you? Every body knows as\nmuch as the savant. The walls of rude minds are scrawled\nall over with facts, with thoughts. They shall one day\nbring a lantern and read the inscriptions. Every man, in\nthe degree in which he has wit and culture, finds his\ncuriosity inflamed concerning the modes of living and\nthinking of other men, and especially of those classes\nwhose minds have not been subdued by the drill of school\neducation.",
        "This instinctive action never ceases in a healthy mind,\nbut becomes richer and more frequent in its informations\nthrough all states of culture. At last comes the era of\nreflection, when we not only observe, but take pains to\nobserve; when we of set purpose sit down to consider an\nabstract truth; when we keep the mind’s eye open whilst\nwe converse, whilst we read, whilst we act, intent to\nlearn the secret law of some class of facts.",
        "What is the hardest task in the world? To think. I would\nput myself in the attitude to look in the eye an abstract\ntruth, and I cannot. I blench and withdraw on this side\nand on that. I seem to know what he meant who said, No man\ncan see God face to face and live. For example, a man\nexplores the basis of civil government. Let him intend his\nmind without respite, without rest, in one direction. His\nbest heed long time avails him nothing. Yet thoughts are\nflitting before him. We all but apprehend, we dimly forebode\nthe truth. We say I will walk abroad, and the truth will\ntake form and clearness to me. We go forth, but cannot find\nit. It seems as if we needed only the stillness and composed\nattitude of the library to seize the thought. But we come in,\nand are as far from it as at first. Then, in a moment, and\nunannounced, the truth appears. A certain wandering light\nappears, and is the distinction, the principle, we wanted.\nBut the oracle comes because we had previously laid siege\nto the shrine. It seems as if the law of the intellect\nresembled that law of nature by which we now inspire, now\nexpire the breath; by which the heart now draws in, then\nhurls out the blood,—the law of undulation. So now you must\nlabor with your brains, and now you must forbear your\nactivity and see what the great Soul showeth.",
        "The immortality of man is as legitimately preached\nfrom the intellections as from the moral volitions.\nEvery intellection is mainly prospective. Its present\nvalue is its least. Inspect what delights you in\nPlutarch, in Shakspeare, in Cervantes. Each truth that\na writer acquires is a lantern, which he turns full\non what facts and thoughts lay already in his mind,\nand behold, all the mats and rubbish which had littered\nhis garret become precious. Every trivial fact in his\nprivate biography becomes an illustration of this new\nprinciple, revisits the day, and delights all men by\nits piquancy and new charm. Men say, Where did he get\nthis? and think there was something divine in his life.\nBut no; they have myriads of facts just as good, would\nthey only get a lamp to ransack their attics withal.",
        "We are all wise. The difference between persons is\nnot in wisdom but in art. I knew, in an academical\nclub, a person who always deferred to me; who, seeing\nmy whim for writing, fancied that my experiences had\nsomewhat superior; whilst I saw that his experiences\nwere as good as mine. Give them to me and I would make\nthe same use of them. He held the old; he holds the\nnew; I had the habit of tacking together the old and\nthe new which he did not use to exercise. This may\nhold in the great examples. Perhaps if we should meet\nShakspeare we should not be conscious of any steep\ninferiority; no, but of a great equality,—only that\nhe possessed a strange skill of using, of classifying,\nhis facts, which we lacked. For notwithstanding our\nutter incapacity to produce anything like Hamlet and\nOthello, see the perfect reception this wit and immense\nknowledge of life and liquid eloquence find in us all.",
        "If you gather apples in the sunshine, or make hay, or\nhoe corn, and then retire within doors and shut your\neyes and press them with your hand, you shall still see\napples hanging in the bright light with boughs and leaves\nthereto, or the tasselled grass, or the corn-flags, and\nthis for five or six hours afterwards. There lie the\nimpressions on the retentive organ, though you knew it\nnot. So lies the whole series of natural images with which\nyour life has made you acquainted, in your memory, though\nyou know it not; and a thrill of passion flashes light on\ntheir dark chamber, and the active power seizes instantly\nthe fit image, as the word of its momentary thought.",
        "It is long ere we discover how rich we are. Our\nhistory, we are sure, is quite tame: we have nothing\nto write, nothing to infer. But our wiser years still\nrun back to the despised recollections of childhood,\nand always we are fishing up some wonderful article\nout of that pond; until by and by we begin to suspect\nthat the biography of the one foolish person we know is,\nin reality, nothing less than the miniature paraphrase\nof the hundred volumes of the Universal History.",
        "In the intellect constructive, which we popularly\ndesignate by the word Genius, we observe the same\nbalance of two elements as in intellect receptive.\nThe constructive intellect produces thoughts, sentences,\npoems, plans, designs, systems. It is the generation of\nthe mind, the marriage of thought with nature. To genius\nmust always go two gifts, the thought and the publication.\nThe first is revelation, always a miracle, which no\nfrequency of occurrence or incessant study can ever\nfamiliarize, but which must always leave the inquirer\nstupid with wonder. It is the advent of truth into the\nworld, a form of thought now for the first time bursting\ninto the universe, a child of the old eternal soul, a\npiece of genuine and immeasurable greatness. It seems,\nfor the time, to inherit all that has yet existed and\nto dictate to the unborn. It affects every thought of\nman and goes to fashion every institution. But to make\nit available it needs a vehicle or art by which it is\nconveyed to men. To be communicable it must become\npicture or sensible object. We must learn the language\nof facts. The most wonderful inspirations die with their\nsubject if he has no hand to paint them to the senses.\nThe ray of light passes invisible through space and\nonly when it falls on an object is it seen. When the\nspiritual energy is directed on something outward, then\nit is a thought. The relation between it and you first\nmakes you, the value of you, apparent to me.  The rich\ninventive genius of the painter must be smothered and\nlost for want of the power of drawing, and in our happy\nhours we should be inexhaustible poets if once we could\nbreak through the silence into adequate rhyme. As all\nmen have some access to primary truth, so all have some\nart or power of communication in their head, but only in\nthe artist does it descend into the hand. There is an\ninequality, whose laws we do not yet know, between two\nmen and between two moments of the same man, in respect\nto this faculty. In common hours we have the same facts\nas in the uncommon or inspired, but they do not sit for\ntheir portraits; they are not detached, but lie in a web.\nThe thought of genius is spontaneous; but the power of\npicture or expression, in the most enriched and flowing\nnature, implies a mixture of will, a certain control over\nthe spontaneous states, without which no production is\npossible. It is a conversion of all nature into the\nrhetoric of thought, under the eye of judgment, with a\nstrenuous exercise of choice. And yet the imaginative\nvocabulary seems to be spontaneous also. It does not flow\nfrom experience only or mainly, but from a richer source.\nNot by any conscious imitation of particular forms are the\ngrand strokes of the painter executed, but by repairing to\nthe fountain-head of all forms in his mind. Who is the first\ndrawing-master? Without instruction we know very well the\nideal of the human form. A child knows if an arm or a leg\nbe distorted in a picture; if the attitude be natural or\ngrand or mean; though he has never received any instruction\nin drawing or heard any conversation on the subject, nor\ncan himself draw with correctness a single feature. A good\nform strikes all eyes pleasantly, long before they have any\nscience on the subject, and a beautiful face sets twenty\nhearts in palpitation, prior to all consideration of the\nmechanical proportions of the features and head. We may owe\nto dreams some light on the fountain of this skill; for as\nsoon as we let our will go and let the unconscious states\nensue, see what cunning draughtsmen we are! We entertain\nourselves with wonderful forms of men, of women, of animals,\nof gardens, of woods and of monsters, and the mystic pencil\nwherewith we then draw has no awkwardness or inexperience,\nno meagreness or poverty; it can design well and group well;\nits composition is full of art, its colors are well laid on\nand the whole canvas which it paints is lifelike and apt to\ntouch us with terror, with tenderness, with desire and with\ngrief. Neither are the artist’s copies from experience ever\nmere copies, but always touched and softened by tints from\nthis ideal domain.",
        "The conditions essential to a constructive mind do\nnot appear to be so often combined but that a good\nsentence or verse remains fresh and memorable for a\nlong time. Yet when we write with ease and come out\ninto the free air of thought, we seem to be assured\nthat nothing is easier than to continue this\ncommunication at pleasure. Up, down, around, the\nkingdom of thought has no inclosures, but the Muse\nmakes us free of her city. Well, the world has a\nmillion writers. One would think then that good thought\nwould be as familiar as air and water, and the gifts of\neach new hour would exclude the last. Yet we can count\nall our good books; nay, I remember any beautiful verse\nfor twenty years. It is true that the discerning intellect\nof the world is always much in advance of the creative,\nso that there are many competent judges of the best book,\nand few writers of the best books. But some of the\nconditions of intellectual construction are of rare\noccurrence. The intellect is a whole and demands integrity\nin every work. This is resisted equally by a man’s devotion\nto a single thought and by his ambition to combine too many.",
        "Truth is our element of life, yet if a man fasten his\nattention on a single aspect of truth and apply himself\nto that alone for a long time, the truth becomes distorted\nand not itself but falsehood; herein resembling the air,\nwhich is our natural element, and the breath of our\nnostrils, but if a stream of the same be directed on the\nbody for a time, it causes cold, fever, and even death.\nHow wearisome the grammarian, the phrenologist, the\npolitical or religious fanatic, or indeed any possessed\nmortal whose balance is lost by the exaggeration of a\nsingle topic. It is incipient insanity. Every thought is\na prison also. I cannot see what you see, because I am\ncaught up by a strong wind and blown so far in one direction\nthat I am out of the hoop of your horizon.",
        "Is it any better if the student, to avoid this offence,\nand to liberalize himself, aims to make a mechanical\nwhole of history, or science, or philosophy, by a\nnumerical addition of all the facts that fall within\nhis vision? The world refuses to be analyzed by addition\nand subtraction. When we are young we spend much time\nand pains in filling our note-books with all definitions\nof Religion, Love, Poetry, Politics, Art, in the hope\nthat in the course of a few years we shall have condensed\ninto our encyclopaedia the net value of all the theories\nat which the world has yet arrived. But year after year\nour tables get no completeness, and at last we discover\nthat our curve is a parabola, whose arcs will never meet.",
        "Neither by detachment neither by aggregation is the\nintegrity of the intellect transmitted to its works,\nbut by a vigilance which brings the intellect in its\ngreatness and best state to operate every moment. It\nmust have the same wholeness which nature has. Although\nno diligence can rebuild the universe in a model by\nthe best accumulation or disposition of details, yet\ndoes the world reappear in miniature in every event, so\nthat all the laws of nature may be read in the smallest\nfact. The intellect must have the like perfection in its\napprehension and in its works. For this reason, an index\nor mercury of intellectual proficiency is the perception\nof identity. We talk with accomplished persons who appear\nto be strangers in nature. The cloud, the tree, the turf,\nthe bird are not theirs, have nothing of them; the world\nis only their lodging and table. But the poet, whose verses\nare to be spheral and complete, is one whom Nature cannot\ndeceive, whatsoever face of strangeness she may put on.\nHe feels a strict consanguinity, and detects more likeness\nthan variety in all her changes. We are stung by the desire\nfor new thought; but when we receive a new thought it is\nonly the old thought with a new face, and though we make\nit our own we instantly crave another; we are not really\nenriched. For the truth was in us before it was reflected\nto us from natural objects; and the profound genius will\ncast the likeness of all creatures into every product of\nhis wit.",
        "But if the constructive powers are rare and it is\ngiven to few men to be poets, yet every man is a\nreceiver of this descending holy ghost, and may\nwell study the laws of its influx. Exactly parallel\nis the whole rule of intellectual duty to the rule\nof moral duty. A self-denial no less austere than\nthe saint’s is demanded of the scholar. He must\nworship truth, and forego all things for that, and\nchoose defeat and pain, so that his treasure in\nthought is thereby augmented.",
        "God offers to every mind its choice between truth and\nrepose. Take which you please,—you can never have both.\nBetween these, as a pendulum, man oscillates. He in whom\nthe love of repose predominates will accept the first\ncreed, the first philosophy, the first political party\nhe meets,—most likely his father’s. He gets rest,\ncommodity, and reputation; but he shuts the door of\ntruth. He in whom the love of truth predominates will\nkeep himself aloof from all moorings, and afloat. He\nwill abstain from dogmatism, and recognize all the\nopposite negations between which, as walls, his being\nis swung. He submits to the inconvenience of suspense\nand imperfect opinion, but he is a candidate for truth,\nas the other is not, and respects the highest law of\nhis being.",
        "The circle of the green earth he must measure with\nhis shoes to find the man who can yield him truth.\nHe shall then know that there is somewhat more blessed\nand great in hearing than in speaking. Happy is the\nhearing man; unhappy the speaking man. As long as I\nhear truth I am bathed by a beautiful element and am\nnot conscious of any limits to my nature. The suggestions\nare thousandfold that I hear and see.  The waters of the\ngreat deep have ingress and egress to the soul. But if I\nspeak, I define, I confine and am less. When Socrates\nspeaks, Lysis and Menexenus are afflicted by no shame\nthat they do not speak.  They also are good. He likewise\ndefers to them, loves them, whilst he speaks. Because a\ntrue and natural man contains and is the same truth which\nan eloquent man articulates; but in the eloquent man,\nbecause he can articulate it, it seems something the less\nto reside, and he turns to these silent beautiful with the\nmore inclination and respect. The ancient sentence said,\nLet us be silent, for so are the gods. Silence is a solvent\nthat destroys personality, and gives us leave to be great\nand universal. Every man’s progress is through a succession\nof teachers, each of whom seems at the time to have a\nsuperlative influence, but it at last gives place to a new.\nFrankly let him accept it all. Jesus says, Leave father,\nmother, house and lands, and follow me. Who leaves all,\nreceives more. This is as true intellectually as morally.\nEach new mind we approach seems to require an abdication of\nall our past and present possessions. A new doctrine seems\nat first a subversion of all our opinions, tastes, and\nmanner of living. Such has Swedenborg, such has Kant, such\nhas Coleridge, such has Hegel or his interpreter Cousin\nseemed to many young men in this country. Take thankfully\nand heartily all they can give. Exhaust them, wrestle with\nthem, let them not go until their blessing be won, and after\na short season the dismay will be overpast, the excess of\ninfluence withdrawn, and they will be no longer an alarming\nmeteor, but one more bright star shining serenely in your\nheaven and blending its light with all your day.",
        "But whilst he gives himself up unreservedly to that\nwhich draws him, because that is his own, he is to\nrefuse himself to that which draws him not, whatsoever\nfame and authority may attend it, because it is not\nhis own. Entire self-reliance belongs to the intellect.\nOne soul is a counterpoise of all souls, as a capillary\ncolumn of water is a balance for the sea. It must treat\nthings and books and sovereign genius as itself also a\nsovereign. If Aeschylus be that man he is taken for, he\nhas not yet done his office when he has educated the\nlearned of Europe for a thousand years. He is now to\napprove himself a master of delight to me also. If he\ncannot do that, all his fame shall avail him nothing\nwith me. I were a fool not to sacrifice a thousand\nAeschyluses to my intellectual integrity. Especially\ntake the same ground in regard to abstract truth, the\nscience of the mind. The Bacon, the Spinoza, the Hume,\nSchelling, Kant, or whosoever propounds to you a philosophy\nof the mind, is only a more or less awkward translator of\nthings in your consciousness which you have also your way\nof seeing, perhaps of denominating. Say then, instead of\ntoo timidly poring into his obscure sense, that he has not\nsucceeded in rendering back to you your consciousness. He\nhas not succeeded; now let another try. If Plato cannot,\nperhaps Spinoza will. If Spinoza cannot, then perhaps Kant.\nAnyhow, when at last it is done, you will find it is no\nrecondite, but a simple, natural, common state which the\nwriter restores to you.",
        "But let us end these didactics. I will not, though\nthe subject might provoke it, speak to the open\nquestion between Truth and Love. I shall not presume\nto interfere in the old politics of the skies;—\"The\ncherubim know most; the seraphim love most.” The gods\nshall settle their own quarrels. But I cannot recite,\neven thus rudely, laws of the intellect, without\nremembering that lofty and sequestered class of men\nwho have been its prophets and oracles, the high-\npriesthood of the pure reason, the Trismegisti, the\nexpounders of the principles of thought from age to\nage. When at long intervals we turn over their abstruse\npages, wonderful seems the calm and grand air of these\nfew, these great spiritual lords who have walked in the\nworld,—these of the old religion,—dwelling in a worship\nwhich makes the sanctities of Christianity look parvenues\nand popular; for “persuasion is in soul, but necessity is\nin intellect.” This band of grandees, Hermes, Heraclitus,\nEmpedocles, Plato, Plotinus, Olympiodorus, Proclus,\nSynesius and the rest, have somewhat so vast in their\nlogic, so primary in their thinking, that it seems\nantecedent to all the ordinary distinctions of rhetoric\nand literature, and to be at once poetry and music and\ndancing and astronomy and mathematics. I am present at\nthe sowing of the seed of the world. With a geometry of\nsunbeams the soul lays the foundations of nature. The\ntruth and grandeur of their thought is proved by its scope\nand applicability, for it commands the entire schedule and\ninventory of things for its illustration. But what marks\nits elevation and has even a comic look to us, is the\ninnocent serenity with which these babe-like Jupiters sit\nin their clouds, and from age to age prattle to each other\nand to no contemporary. Well assured that their speech is\nintelligible and the most natural thing in the world, they\nadd thesis to thesis, without a moment’s heed of the\nuniversal astonishment of the human race below, who do not\ncomprehend their plainest argument; nor do they ever relent\nso much as to insert a popular or explaining sentence, nor\ntestify the least displeasure or petulance at the dulness\nof their amazed auditory.  The angels are so enamored of\nthe language that is spoken in heaven that they will not\ndistort their lips with the hissing and unmusical dialects\nof men, but speak their own, whether there be any who\nunderstand it or not.",
        "Because the soul is progressive, it never quite\nrepeats itself, but in every act attempts the\nproduction of a new and fairer whole.  This appears\nin works both of the useful and the fine arts, if\nwe employ the popular distinction of works according\nto their aim either at use or beauty. Thus in our\nfine arts, not imitation but creation is the aim. In\nlandscapes the painter should give the suggestion of\na fairer creation than we know. The details, the prose\nof nature he should omit and give us only the spirit\nand splendor.  He should know that the landscape has\nbeauty for his eye because it expresses a thought\nwhich is to him good; and this because the same power\nwhich sees through his eyes is seen in that spectacle;\nand he will come to value the expression of nature and\nnot nature itself, and so exalt in his copy the features\nthat please him. He will give the gloom of gloom and the\nsunshine of sunshine. In a portrait he must inscribe the\ncharacter and not the features, and must esteem the man\nwho sits to him as himself only an imperfect picture or\nlikeness of the aspiring original within.",
        "What is that abridgment and selection we observe\nin all spiritual activity, but itself the creative\nimpulse? for it is the inlet of that higher\nillumination which teaches to convey a larger sense\nby simpler symbols. What is a man but nature’s finer\nsuccess in self-explication? What is a man but a finer\nand compacter landscape than the horizon figures,—\nnature’s eclecticism? and what is his speech, his love\nof painting, love of nature, but a still finer success,\n—all the weary miles and tons of space and bulk left\nout, and the spirit or moral of it contracted into a\nmusical word, or the most cunning stroke of the pencil?",
        "But the artist must employ the symbols in use in\nhis day and nation to convey his enlarged sense to\nhis fellow-men. Thus the new in art is always formed\nout of the old. The Genius of the Hour sets his\nineffaceable seal on the work and gives it an\ninexpressible charm for the imagination. As far as\nthe spiritual character of the period overpowers the\nartist and finds expression in his work, so far it\nwill retain a certain grandeur, and will represent\nto future beholders the Unknown, the Inevitable, the\nDivine. No man can quite exclude this element of\nNecessity from his labor. No man can quite emancipate\nhimself from his age and country, or produce a model\nin which the education, the religion, the politics,\nusages and arts of his times shall have no share.\nThough he were never so original, never so wilful\nand fantastic, he cannot wipe out of his work every\ntrace of the thoughts amidst which it grew. The very\navoidance betrays the usage he avoids. Above his will\nand out of his sight he is necessitated by the air he\nbreathes and the idea on which he and his contemporaries\nlive and toil, to share the manner of his times, without\nknowing what that manner is. Now that which is inevitable\nin the work has a higher charm than individual talent can\never give, inasmuch as the artist’s pen or chisel seems\nto have been held and guided by a gigantic hand to inscribe\na line in the history of the human race. This circumstance\ngives a value to the Egyptian hieroglyphics, to the Indian,\nChinese and Mexican idols, however gross and shapeless.\nThey denote the height of the human soul in that hour,\nand were not fantastic, but sprung from a necessity as\ndeep as the world. Shall I now add that the whole extant\nproduct of the plastic arts has herein its highest value,\nas history; as a stroke drawn in the portrait of that fate,\nperfect and beautiful, according to whose ordinations all\nbeings advance to their beatitude?",
        "Thus, historically viewed, it has been the office\nof art to educate the perception of beauty. We are\nimmersed in beauty, but our eyes have no clear vision.\nIt needs, by the exhibition of single traits, to assist\nand lead the dormant taste. We carve and paint, or we\nbehold what is carved and painted, as students of the\nmystery of Form. The virtue of art lies in detachment,\nin sequestering one object from the embarrassing variety.\nUntil one thing comes out from the connection of things,\nthere can be enjoyment, contemplation, but no thought.\nOur happiness and unhappiness are unproductive. The\ninfant lies in a pleasing trance, but his individual\ncharacter and his practical power depend on his daily\nprogress in the separation of things, and dealing with\none at a time. Love and all the passions concentrate\nall existence around a single form. It is the habit of\ncertain minds to give an all-excluding fulness to the\nobject, the thought, the word, they alight upon, and\nto make that for the time the deputy of the world.\nThese are the artists, the orators, the leaders of\nsociety. The power to detach and to magnify by detaching\nis the essence of rhetoric in the hands of the orator and\nthe poet. This rhetoric, or power to fix the momentary\neminency of an object,—so remarkable in Burke, in Byron,\nin Carlyle,—the painter and sculptor exhibit in color\nand in stone. The power depends on the depth of the\nartist’s insight of that object he contemplates. For\nevery object has its roots in central nature, and may of\ncourse be so exhibited to us as to represent the world.\nTherefore each work of genius is the tyrant of the hour\nAnd concentrates attention on itself. For the time, it\nis the only thing worth naming to do that,—be it a\nsonnet, an opera, a landscape, a statue, an oration,\nthe plan of a temple, of a campaign, or of a voyage of\ndiscovery. Presently we pass to some other object, which\nrounds itself into a whole as did the first; for example\na well-laid garden; and nothing seems worth doing but the\nlaying out of gardens. I should think fire the best thing\nin the world, if I were not acquainted with air, and water,\nand earth. For it is the right and property of all natural\nobjects, of all genuine talents, of all native properties\nwhatsoever, to be for their moment the top of the world.\nA squirrel leaping from bough to bough and making the\nWood but one wide tree for his pleasure, fills the eye\nnot less than a lion,—is beautiful, self-sufficing, and\nstands then and there for nature. A good ballad draws my\near and heart whilst I listen, as much as an epic has\ndone before. A dog, drawn by a master, or a litter of\npigs, satisfies and is a reality not less than the\nfrescoes of Angelo. From this succession of excellent\nobjects we learn at last the immensity of the world,\nthe opulence of human nature, which can run out to\ninfinitude in any direction. But I also learn that what\nastonished and fascinated me in the first work astonished\nme in the second work also; that excellence of all things\nis one.",
        "The office of painting and sculpture seems to be\nmerely initial. The best pictures can easily tell\nus their last secret.  The best pictures are rude\ndraughts of a few of the miraculous dots and lines\nand dyes which make up the ever-changing “landscape\nwith figures” amidst which we dwell. Painting seems\nto be to the eye what dancing is to the limbs. When\nthat has educated the frame to self-possession, to\nnimbleness, to grace, the steps of the dancing-master\nare better forgotten; so painting teaches me the\nsplendor of color and the expression of form, and as\nI see many pictures and higher genius in the art, I\nsee the boundless opulence of the pencil, the\nindifferency in which the artist stands free to choose\nout of the possible forms. If he can draw every thing,\nwhy draw any thing? and then is my eye opened to the\neternal picture which nature paints in the street, with\nmoving men and children, beggars and fine ladies, draped\nin red and green and blue and gray; long-haired, grizzled,\nwhite-faced, black-faced, wrinkled, giant, dwarf, expanded,\nelfish,—capped and based by heaven, earth and sea.",
        "A gallery of sculpture teaches more austerely the\nsame lesson.  As picture teaches the coloring, so\nsculpture the anatomy of form.  When I have seen\nfine statues and afterwards enter a public assembly,\nI understand well what he meant who said, “When I\nhave been reading Homer, all men look like giants.\"\nI too see that painting and sculpture are gymnastics\nof the eye, its training to the niceties and curiosities\nof its function. There is no statue like this living\nman, with his infinite advantage over all ideal sculpture,\nof perpetual variety. What a gallery of art have I here!\nNo mannerist made these varied groups and diverse original\nsingle figures. Here is the artist himself improvising,\ngrim and glad, at his block. Now one thought strikes him,\nnow another, and with each moment he alters the whole air,\nattitude and expression of his clay. Away with your\nnonsense of oil and easels, of marble and chisels; except\nto open your eyes to the masteries of eternal art, they\nare hypocritical rubbish.",
        "The reference of all production at last to an\naboriginal Power explains the traits common to all\nworks of the highest art,—that they are universally\nintelligible; that they restore to us the simplest\nstates of mind, and are religious. Since what skill\nis therein shown is the reappearance of the original\nsoul, a jet of pure light, it should produce a similar\nimpression to that made by natural objects. In happy\nhours, nature appears to us one with art; art perfected,\n—the work of genius. And the individual, in whom simple\ntastes and susceptibility to all the great human\ninfluences overpower the accidents of a local and special\nculture, is the best critic of art. Though we travel the\nworld over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with\nus, or we find it not. The best of beauty is a finer\ncharm than skill in surfaces, in outlines, or rules of\nart can ever teach, namely a radiation from the work of\nart of human character,—a wonderful expression through\nstone, or canvas, or musical sound, of the deepest and\nsimplest attributes of our nature, and therefore most\nintelligible at last to those souls which have these\nattributes.  In the sculptures of the Greeks, in the\nmasonry of the Romans, and in the pictures of the Tuscan\nand Venetian masters, the highest charm is the universal\nlanguage they speak. A confession of moral nature, of\npurity, love, and hope, breathes from them all. That\nwhich we carry to them, the same we bring back more\nfairly illustrated in the memory. The traveller who\nvisits the Vatican, and passes from chamber to chamber\nthrough galleries of statues, vases, sarcophagi and\ncandelabra, through all forms of beauty cut in the\nrichest materials, is in danger of forgetting the\nsimplicity of the principles out of which they all\nsprung, and that they had their origin from thoughts\nand laws in his own breast. He studies the technical\nrules on these wonderful remains, but forgets that\nthese works were not always thus constellated; that\nthey are the contributions of many ages and many\ncountries; that each came out of the solitary workshop\nof one artist, who toiled perhaps in ignorance of the\nexistence of other sculpture, created his work without\nother model save life, household life, and the sweet\nand smart of personal relations, of beating hearts, and\nmeeting eyes; of poverty and necessity and hope and fear.\nThese were his inspirations, and these are the effects\nhe carries home to your heart and mind. In proportion to\nhis force, the artist will find in his work an outlet for\nhis proper character. He must not be in any manner pinched\nor hindered by his material, but through his necessity\nof imparting himself the adamant will be wax in his hands,\nand will allow an adequate communication of himself, in\nhis full stature and proportion. He need not cumber himself\nwith a conventional nature and culture, nor ask what is the\nmode in Rome or in Paris, but that house and weather and\nmanner of living which poverty and the fate of birth have\nmade at once so odious and so dear, in the gray unpainted\nwood cabin, on the corner of a New Hampshire farm, or in\nthe log-hut of the backwoods, or in the narrow lodging\nwhere he has endured the constraints and seeming of a city\npoverty, will serve as well as any other condition as the\nsymbol of a thought which pours itself indifferently\nthrough all.",
        "I remember when in my younger days I had heard of\nthe wonders of Italian painting, I fancied the great\npictures would be great strangers; some surprising\ncombination of color and form; a foreign wonder,\nbarbaric pearl and gold, like the spontoons and\nstandards of the militia, which play such pranks in\nthe eyes and imaginations of school-boys. I was to\nsee and acquire I knew not what. When I came at last\nto Rome and saw with eyes the pictures, I found that\ngenius left to novices the gay and fantastic and\nostentatious, and itself pierced directly to the\nsimple and true; that it was familiar and sincere;\nthat it was the old, eternal fact I had met already\nin so many forms,—unto which I lived; that it was\nthe plain you and me I knew so well,—had left at home\nin so many conversations. I had the same experience\nalready in a church at Naples. There I saw that nothing\nwas changed with me but the place, and said to myself—\n’Thou foolish child, hast thou come out hither, over\nfour thousand miles of salt water, to find that which\nwas perfect to thee there at home?’  That fact I saw\nagain in the Academmia at Naples, in the chambers of\nsculpture, and yet again when I came to Rome and to\nthe paintings of Raphael, Angelo, Sacchi, Titian, and\nLeonardo da Vinci. “What, old mole! workest thou in\nthe earth so fast?” It had travelled by my side; that\nwhich I fancied I had left in Boston was here in the\nVatican, and again at Milan and at Paris, and made all\ntravelling ridiculous as a treadmill. I now require\nthis of all pictures, that they domesticate me, not\nthat they dazzle me. Pictures must not be too picturesque.\nNothing astonishes men so much as common-sense and\nplain dealing. All great actions have been simple, and\nall great pictures are.",
        "The Transfiguration, by Raphael, is an eminent\nexample of this peculiar merit. A calm benignant\nbeauty shines over all this picture, and goes\ndirectly to the heart. It seems almost to call\nyou by name. The sweet and sublime face of Jesus\nis beyond praise, yet how it disappoints all florid\nexpectations! This familiar, simple, home-speaking\ncountenance is as if one should meet a friend. The\nknowledge of picture-dealers has its value, but\nlisten not to their criticism when your heart is\ntouched by genius. It was not painted for them, it\nwas painted for you; for such as had eyes capable\nof being touched by simplicity and lofty emotions.",
        "Yet when we have said all our fine things about\nthe arts, we must end with a frank confession, that\nthe arts, as we know them, are but initial. Our best\npraise is given to what they aimed and promised, not\nto the actual result. He has conceived meanly of the\nresources of man, who believes that the best age of\nproduction is past. The real value of the Iliad or\nthe Transfiguration is as signs of power; billows or\nripples they are of the stream of tendency; tokens of\nthe everlasting effort to produce, which even in its\nworst estate the soul betrays. Art has not yet come\nto its maturity if it do not put itself abreast with\nthe most potent influences of the world, if it is not\npractical and moral, if it do not stand in connection\nwith the conscience, if it do not make the poor and\nuncultivated feel that it addresses them with a voice\nof lofty cheer. There is higher work for Art than the\narts. They are abortive births of an imperfect or\nvitiated instinct. Art is the need to create; but in\nits essence, immense and universal, it is impatient of\nworking with lame or tied hands, and of making cripples\nand monsters, such as all pictures and statues are.\nNothing less than the creation of man and nature is its\nend. A man should find in it an outlet for his whole\nenergy. He may paint and carve only as long as he can\ndo that. Art should exhilarate, and throw down the\nwalls of circumstance on every side, awakening in the\nbeholder the same sense of universal relation and power\nwhich the work evinced in the artist, and its highest\neffect is to make new artists.",
        "Already History is old enough to witness the old\nage and disappearance of particular arts. The art\nof sculpture is long ago perished to any real effect.\nIt was originally a useful art, a mode of writing, a\nsavage’s record of gratitude or devotion, and among\na people possessed of a wonderful perception of form\nthis childish carving was refined to the utmost\nsplendor of effect. But it is the game of a rude and\nyouthful people, and not the manly labor of a wise\nand spiritual nation. Under an oak-tree loaded with\nleaves and nuts, under a sky full of eternal eyes, I\nstand in a thoroughfare; but in the works of our\nplastic arts and especially of sculpture, creation\nis driven into a corner. I cannot hide from myself\nthat there is a certain appearance of paltriness, as\nof toys and the trumpery of a theatre, in sculpture.\nNature transcends all our moods of thought, and its\nsecret we do not yet find. But the gallery stands at\nthe mercy of our moods, and there is a moment when\nit becomes frivolous.  I do not wonder that Newton,\nwith an attention habitually engaged on the paths of\nplanets and suns, should have wondered what the Earl\nof Pembroke found to admire in “stone dolls.” Sculpture\nmay serve to teach the pupil how deep is the secret of\nform, how purely the spirit can translate its meanings\ninto that eloquent dialect. But the statue will look\ncold and false before that new activity which needs\nto roll through all things, and is impatient of\ncounterfeits and things not alive. Picture and sculpture\nare the celebrations and festivities of form. But true\nart is never fixed, but always flowing. The sweetest music\nis not in the oratorio, but in the human voice when it\nspeaks from its instant life tones of tenderness, truth,\nor courage. The oratorio has already lost its relation to\nthe morning, to the sun, and the earth, but that persuading\nvoice is in tune with these. All works of art should not\nbe detached, but extempore performances. A great man is\na new statue in every attitude and action. A beautiful\nwoman is a picture which drives all beholders nobly mad.\nLife may be lyric or epic, as well as a poem or a romance.",
        "A true announcement of the law of creation, if a\nman were found worthy to declare it, would carry\nart up into the kingdom of nature, and destroy its\nseparate and contrasted existence. The fountains\nof invention and beauty in modern society are all\nbut dried up. A popular novel, a theatre, or a\nball-room makes us feel that we are all paupers in\nthe alms-house of this world, without dignity,\nwithout skill or industry. Art is as poor and low.\nThe old tragic Necessity, which lowers on the brows\neven of the Venuses and the Cupids of the antique,\nand furnishes the sole apology for the intrusion of\nsuch anomalous figures into nature,—namely, that\nthey were inevitable; that the artist was drunk with\na passion for form which he could not resist, and\nwhich vented itself in these fine extravagances,—no\nlonger dignifies the chisel or the pencil. But the\nartist and the connoisseur now seek in art the\nexhibition of their talent, or an asylum from the\nevils of life. Men are not well pleased with the\nfigure they make in their own imaginations, and they\nflee to art, and convey their better sense in an\noratorio, a statue, or a picture. Art makes the same\neffort which a sensual prosperity makes; namely to\ndetach the beautiful from the useful, to do up the\nwork as unavoidable, and, hating it, pass on to\nenjoyment. These solaces and compensations, this\ndivision of beauty from use, the laws of nature do\nnot permit. As soon as beauty is sought, not from\nreligion and love but for pleasure, it degrades the\nseeker. High beauty is no longer attainable by him in\ncanvas or in stone, in sound, or in lyrical construction;\nan effeminate, prudent, sickly beauty, which is not\nbeauty, is all that can be formed; for the hand can\nnever execute any thing higher than the character can\ninspire.",
        "The art that thus separates is itself first separated.\nArt must not be a superficial talent, but must begin\nfarther back in man.  Now men do not see nature to be\nbeautiful, and they go to make a statue which shall\nbe. They abhor men as tasteless, dull, and inconvertible,\nand console themselves with color-bags and blocks of\nmarble. They reject life as prosaic, and create a death\nwhich they call poetic. They despatch the day’s weary\nchores, and fly to voluptuous reveries. They eat and\ndrink, that they may afterwards execute the ideal. Thus\nis art vilified; the name conveys to the mind its\nsecondary and bad senses; it stands in the imagination\nas somewhat contrary to nature, and struck with death\nfrom the first.  Would it not be better to begin higher\nup,—to serve the ideal before they eat and drink; to\nserve the ideal in eating and drinking, in drawing the\nbreath, and in the functions of life? Beauty must come\nback to the useful arts, and the distinction between\nthe fine and the useful arts be forgotten. If history\nwere truly told, if life were nobly spent, it would be\nno longer easy or possible to distinguish the one from\nthe other. In nature, all is useful, all is beautiful.\nIt is therefore beautiful because it is alive, moving,\nreproductive; it is therefore useful because it is\nsymmetrical and fair. Beauty will not come at the call\nof a legislature, nor will it repeat in England or\nAmerica its history in Greece. It will come, as always,\nunannounced, and spring up between the feet of brave\nand earnest men. It is in vain that we look for genius\nto reiterate its miracles in the old arts; it is its\ninstinct to find beauty and holiness in new and necessary\nfacts, in the field and road-side, in the shop and mill.\nProceeding from a religious heart it will raise to a\ndivine use the railroad, the insurance office, the joint-\nstock company; our law, our primary assemblies, our\ncommerce, the galvanic battery, the electric jar, the\nprism, and the chemist’s retort; in which we seek now\nonly an economical use. Is not the selfish and even cruel\naspect which belongs to our great mechanical works, to\nmills, railways, and machinery, the effect of the mercenary\nimpulses which these works obey? When its errands are noble\nand adequate, a steamboat bridging the Atlantic between Old\nand New England and arriving at its ports with the\npunctuality of a planet, is a step of man into harmony with\nnature. The boat at St. Petersburg, which plies along the\nLena by magnetism, needs little to make it sublime. When\nscience is learned in love, and its powers are wielded by\nlove, they will appear the supplements and continuations\nof the material creation.",
