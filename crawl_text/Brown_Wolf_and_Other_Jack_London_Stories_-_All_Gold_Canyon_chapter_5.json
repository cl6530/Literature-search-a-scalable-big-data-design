        "It was the green heart of the canyon, where the walls swerved back from\nthe rigid plan and relieved their harshness of line by making a little\nsheltered nook and filling it to the brim with sweetness and roundness\nand softness. Here all things rested. Even the narrow stream ceased its\nturbulent down-rush long enough to form a quiet pool. Knee-deep in the\nwater, with drooping head and half-shut eyes, drowsed a red-coated,\nmany-antlered buck.",
        "On one side, beginning at the very lip of the pool, was a tiny meadow, a\ncool, resilient surface of green that extended to the base of the\nfrowning wall. Beyond the pool a gentle slope of earth ran up and up to\nmeet the opposing wall. Fine grass covered the slope–grass that was\nspangled with flowers, with here and there patches of color, orange and\npurple and golden. Below, the canyon was shut in. There was no view.\nThe walls leaned together abruptly and the canyon ended in a chaos of\nrocks, moss-covered and hidden by a green screen of vines and creepers\nand boughs of trees. Up the canyon rose far hills and peaks, the big\nfoothills, pine-covered and remote. And far beyond, like clouds upon the\nborder of the sky, towered minarets of white, where the Sierra’s eternal\nsnows flashed austerely the blazes of the sun.",
        "There was no dust in the canyon. The leaves and flowers were clean and\nvirginal. The grass was young velvet. Over the pool three cottonwoods\nsent their snowy fluffs fluttering down the quiet air. On the slope the\nblossoms of the wine-wooded manzanita filled the air with springtime\nodors, while the leaves, wise with experience, were already beginning\ntheir vertical twist against the coming aridity of summer. In the open\nspaces on the slope, beyond the farthest shadow-reach of the manzanita,\npoised the mariposa lilies, like so many flights of jewelled moths\nsuddenly arrested and on the verge of trembling into flight again. Here\nand there that woods harlequin, the madrone, permitting itself to be\ncaught in the act of changing its pea-green trunk to madder-red,\nbreathed its fragrance into the air from great clusters of waxen bells.\nCreamy white were these bells, shaped like lilies-of-the-valley, with\nthe sweetness of perfume that is of the springtime.",
        "There was not a sigh of wind. The air was drowsy with its weight of\nperfume. It was a sweetness that would have been cloying had the air\nbeen heavy and humid. But the air was sharp and thin. It was as\nstarlight transmuted into atmosphere, shot through and warmed by\nsunshine, and flower-drenched with sweetness.",
        "An occasional butterfly drifted in and out through the patches of light\nand shade. And from all about rose the low and sleepy hum of mountain\nbees–feasting Sybarites that jostled one another good-naturedly at the\nboard, nor found time for rough discourtesy. So quietly did the little\nstream drip and ripple its way through the canyon that it spoke only in\nfaint and occasional gurgles. The voice of the stream was as a drowsy\nwhisper, ever interrupted by dozings and silences, ever lifted again in\nthe awakenings.",
        "The motion of all things was a drifting in the heart of the canyon.\nSunshine and butterflies drifted in and out among the trees. The hum of\nthe bees and the whisper of the stream were a drifting of sound. And the\ndrifting sound and drifting color seemed to weave together in the making\nof a delicate and intangible fabric which was the spirit of the place.\nIt was a spirit of peace that was not of death, but of smooth-pulsing\nlife, of quietude that was not silence, of movement that was not action,\nof repose that was quick with existence without being violent with\nstruggle and travail. The spirit of the place was the spirit of the\npeace of the living, somnolent with the easement and content of\nprosperity, and undisturbed by rumors of far wars.",
        "The red-coated, many-antlered buck acknowledged the lordship of the\nspirit of the place and dozed knee-deep in the cool, shaded pool. There\nseemed no flies to vex him and he was languid with rest. Sometimes his\nears moved when the stream awoke and whispered; but they moved lazily,\nwith foreknowledge that it was merely the stream grown garrulous at\ndiscovery that it had slept.",
        "But there came a time when the buck’s ears lifted and tensed with swift\neagerness for sound. His head was turned down the canyon. His\nsensitive, quivering nostrils scented the air. His eyes could not\npierce the green screen through which the stream rippled away, but to\nhis ears came the voice of a man. It was a steady, monotonous, singsong\nvoice. Once the buck heard the harsh clash of metal upon rock. At the\nsound he snorted with a sudden start that jerked him through the air\nfrom water to meadow, and his feet sank into the young velvet, while he\npricked his ears and again scented the air. Then he stole across the\ntiny meadow, pausing once and again to listen, and faded away out of the\ncanyon like a wraith, soft-footed and without sound.",
        "The clash of steel-shod soles against the rocks began to be heard, and\nthe man’s voice grew louder. It was raised in a sort of chant and became\ndistinct with nearness, so that the words could be heard:",
        "   “Tu’n around an’ tu’n yo’ face\n   Untoe them sweet hills of grace\n     (D’ pow’rs of sin yo’ am scornin’!).\n   Look about an’ look aroun’\n   Fling yo’ sin-pack on d’ groun’\n     (Yo’ will meet wid d’ Lord in d’ mornin’!).”",
        "’A sound of scrambling accompanied the song, and the spirit of the place\nfled away on the heels of the red-coated buck. The green screen was\nburst asunder, and a man peered out at the meadow and the pool and the\nsloping side-hill. He was a deliberate sort of man. He took in the scene\nwith one embracing glance, then ran his eyes over the details to verify\nthe general impression. Then, and not until then, did he open his mouth\nin vivid and solemn approval:",
        "“Smoke of life an’ snakes of purgatory! Will you just look at that! Wood\nan’ water an’ grass an’ a side-hill! A pocket-hunter’s delight an’ a\ncayuse’s paradise! Cool green for tired eyes! Pink pills for pale people\nain’t in it. A secret pasture for prospectors and a resting-place for\ntired burros. It’s just booful!”",
        "He was a sandy-complexioned man in whose face geniality and humor seemed\nthe salient characteristics. It was a mobile face, quick-changing to\ninward mood and thought. Thinking was in him a visible process. Ideas\nchased across his face like wind-flaws across the surface of a lake. His\nhair, sparse and unkempt of growth, was as indeterminate and colorless\nas his complexion. It would seem that all the color of his frame had\ngone into his eyes, for they were startlingly blue. Also, they were\nlaughing and merry eyes, within them much of the naiveté and wonder of\nthe child; and yet, in an unassertive way, they contained much of calm\nself-reliance and strength of purpose founded upon self-experience and\nexperience of the world.",
        "From out the screen of vines and creepers he flung ahead of him a\nminer’s pick and shovel and gold-pan. Then he crawled out himself into\nthe open. He was clad in faded overalls and black cotton shirt, with\nhobnailed brogans on his feet, and on his head a hat whose shapelessness\nand stains advertised the rough usage of wind and rain and sun and\ncamp-smoke. He stood erect, seeing wide-eyed the secrecy of the scene\nand sensuously inhaling the warm, sweet breath of the canyon-garden\nthrough nostrils that dilated and quivered with delight. His eyes\nnarrowed to laughing slits of blue, his face wreathed itself in joy, and\nhis mouth curled in a smile as he cried aloud:",
        "“Jumping dandelions and happy hollyhocks, but that smells good to me!\nTalk about your attar o’ roses an’ cologne factories! They ain’t in it!”",
        "He had the habit of soliloquy. His quick-changing facial expressions\nmight tell every thought and mood, but the tongue, perforce, ran hard\nafter, repeating, like a second Boswell.",
        "The man lay down on the lip of the pool and drank long and deep of its\nwater. “Tastes good to me,” he murmured, lifting his head and gazing\nacross the pool at the side-hill, while he wiped his mouth with the back\nof his hand. The side-hill attracted his attention. Still lying on his\nstomach, he studied the hill formation long and carefully. It was a\npractised eye that traveled up the slope to the crumbling canyon-wall\nand back and down again to the edge of the pool. He scrambled to his\nfeet and favored the side-hill with a second survey.",
        "“Looks good to me,” he concluded, picking up his pick and shovel and\ngold-pan.",
        "He crossed the stream below the pool, stepping agilely from stone to\nstone. Where the side-hill touched the water he dug up a shovelful of\ndirt and put it into the gold-pan. He squatted down, holding the pan in\nhis two hands, and partly immersing it in the stream. Then he imparted\nto the pan a deft circular motion that sent the water sluicing in and\nout through the dirt and gravel. The larger and the lighter particles\nworked to the surface, and these, by a skilful dipping movement of the\npan, he spilled out and over the edge. Occasionally, to expedite\nmatters, he rested the pan and with his fingers raked out the large\npebbles and pieces of rock.",
        "The contents of the pan diminished rapidly until only fine dirt and the\nsmallest bits of gravel remained. At this stage he began to work very\ndeliberately and carefully. It was fine washing, and he washed fine and\nfiner, with a keen scrutiny and delicate and fastidious touch. At last\nthe pan seemed empty of everything but water; but with a quick\nsemi-circular flirt that sent the water flying over the shallow rim into\nthe stream, he disclosed a layer of black sand on the bottom of the pan.\nSo thin was this layer that it was like a streak of paint. He examined\nit closely. In the midst of it was a tiny golden speck. He dribbled a\nlittle water in over the depressed edge of the pan. With a quick flirt\nhe sent the water sluicing across the bottom, turning the grains of\nblack sand over and over. A second tiny golden speck rewarded his\neffort.",
        "The washing had now become very fine–fine beyond all need of ordinary\nplacer-mining. He worked the black sand, a small portion at a time, up\nthe shallow rim of the pan. Each small portion he examined sharply, so\nthat his eyes saw every grain of it before he allowed it to slide over\nthe edge and away. Jealously, bit by bit, he let the black sand slip\naway. A golden speck, no larger than a pin-point, appeared on the rim,\nand by his manipulation of the water it returned to the bottom of the\npan. And in such fashion another speck was disclosed, and another. Great\nwas his care of them. Like a shepherd he herded his flock of golden\nspecks so that not one should be lost. At last, of the pan of dirt\nnothing remained but his golden herd. He counted it, and then, after all\nhis labor, sent it flying out of the pan with one final swirl of water.",
        "But his blue eyes were shining with desire as he rose to his feet.\n“Seven,” he muttered aloud, asserting the sum of the specks for which he\nhad toiled so hard and which he had so wantonly thrown away. “Seven,” he\nrepeated, with the emphasis of one trying to impress a number on his\nmemory.",
        "He stood still a long while, surveying the hillside. In his eyes was a\ncuriosity, new-aroused and burning. There was an exultance about his\nbearing and a keenness like that of a hunting animal catching the fresh\nscent of game.",
        "He moved down the stream a few steps and took a second panful of dirt.",
        "Again came the careful washing, the jealous herding of the golden\nspecks, and the wantonness with which he sent them flying into the\nstream.",
        "“Five,” he muttered, and repeated, “five.”",
        "He could not forbear another survey of the hill before filling the pan\nfarther down the stream. His golden herds diminished. “Four, three, two,\ntwo, one,” were his memory tabulations as he moved down the stream. When\nbut one speck of gold rewarded his washing, he stopped and built a fire\nof dry twigs. Into this he thrust the gold-pan and burned it till it was\nblue-black. He held up the pan and examined it critically. Then he\nnodded approbation. Against such a color-background he could defy the\ntiniest yellow speck to elude him.",
        "Still moving down the stream, he panned again. A single speck was his\nreward. A third pan contained no gold at all. Not satisfied with this,\nhe panned three times again, taking his shovels of dirt within a foot of\none another. Each pan proved empty of gold, and the fact, instead of\ndiscouraging him, seemed to give him satisfaction. His elation increased\nwith each barren washing, until he arose, exclaiming jubilantly:",
        "“If it ain’t the real thing, may God knock off my head with sour\napples!”",
        "Returning to where he had started operations, he began to pan up the\nstream. At first his golden herds increased–increased prodigiously.\n“Fourteen, eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-six,” ran his memory\ntabulations. Just above the pool he struck his richest pan–thirty-five\ncolors.",
        "“Almost enough to save,” he remarked regretfully as he allowed the water\nto sweep them away.",
        "The sun climbed to the top of the sky. The man worked on. Pan by pan, he\nwent up the stream, the tally of results steadily decreasing.",
        "“It’s just booful, the way it peters out,” he exulted when a shovelful\nof dirt contained no more than a single speck of gold. And when no\nspecks at all were found in several pans, he straightened up and favored\nthe hillside with a confident glance.",
        "“Ah, ha! Mr. Pocket!” he cried out, as though to an auditor hidden\nsomewhere above him beneath the surface of the slope. “Ah, ha! Mr.\nPocket! I’m a-comin’, I’m a-comin’, an’ I’m shorely gwine to get yer!\nYou heah me, Mr. Pocket? I’m gwine to get yer as shore as punkins ain’t\ncauliflowers!”",
        "He turned and flung a measuring glance at the sun poised above him in\nthe azure of the cloudless sky. Then he went down the canyon, following\nthe line of shovel-holes he had made in filling the pans. He crossed the\nstream below the pool and disappeared through the green screen. There\nwas little opportunity for the spirit of the place to return with its\nquietude and repose, for the man’s voice, raised in ragtime song, still\ndominated the canyon with possession.",
        "After a time, with a greater clashing of steel-shod feet on rock, he\nreturned. The green screen was tremendously agitated. It surged back and\nforth in the throes of a struggle. There was a loud grating and clanging\nof metal. The man’s voice leaped to a higher pitch and was sharp with\nimperativeness. A large body plunged and panted. There was a snapping\nand ripping and rending, and amid a shower of falling leaves a horse\nburst through the screen. On its back was a pack, and from this trailed\nbroken vines and torn creepers. The animal gazed with astonished eyes at\nthe scene into which it had been precipitated, then dropped its head to\nthe grass and began contentedly to graze. A second horse scrambled into\nview, slipping once on the mossy rocks and regaining equilibrium when\nits hoofs sank into the yielding surface of the meadow. It was\nriderless, though on its back was a high-horned Mexican saddle, scarred\nand discolored by long usage.",
        "The man brought up the rear. He threw off pack and saddle, with an eye\nto camp location, and gave the animals their freedom to graze. He\nunpacked his food and got out frying-pan and coffee-pot. He gathered an\narmful of dry wood, and with a few stones made a place for his fire.",
        "“My!” he said, “but I’ve got an appetite. I could scoff iron-filings an’\nhorseshoe nails an’ thank you kindly, ma’am, for a second helpin’.”",
        "He straightened up, and, while he reached for matches in the pocket of\nhis overalls, his eyes traveled across the pool to the side-hill. His\nfingers had clutched the match-box, but they relaxed their hold and the\nhand came out empty. The man wavered perceptibly. He looked at his\npreparations for cooking and he looked at the hill.",
        "“Guess I’ll take another whack at her,” he concluded, starting to cross\nthe stream.",
        "“They ain’t no sense in it, I know,” he mumbled apologetically. “But\nkeepin’ grub back an hour ain’t go in’ to hurt none, I reckon.”",
        "A few feet back from his first line of test-pans he started a second\nline. The sun dropped down the western sky, the shadows lengthened, but\nthe man worked on. He began a third line of test-pans. He was\ncross-cutting the hillside, line by line, as he ascended. The center of\neach line produced the richest pans, while the ends came where no colors\nshowed in the pan. And as he ascended the hillside the lines grew\nperceptibly shorter. The regularity with which their length diminished\nserved to indicate that somewhere up the slope the last line would be so\nshort as to have scarcely length at all, and that beyond could come\nonly a point. The design was growing into an inverted “V.” The\nconverging sides of this “V” marked the boundaries of the gold-bearing\ndirt.",
        "The apex of the “V” was evidently the man’s goal. Often he ran his eye\nalong the converging sides and on up the hill, trying to divine the\napex, the point where the gold-bearing dirt must cease. Here resided\n“Mr. Pocket\"–for so the man familiarly addressed the imaginary point\nabove him on the slope, crying out:",
        "“Come down out o’ that, Mr. Pocket! Be right smart an’ agreeable, an’\ncome down!”",
        "“All right,” he would add later, in a voice resigned to determination.\n“All right, Mr. Pocket. It’s plain to me I got to come right up an’\nsnatch you out bald-headed. An’ I’ll do it! I’ll do it!” he would\nthreaten still later.",
        "Each pan he carried down to the water to wash, and as he went higher up\nthe hill the pans grew richer, until he began to save the gold in an\nempty baking powder can which he carried carelessly in his hip-pocket.\nSo engrossed was he in his toil that he did not notice the long twilight\nof oncoming night. It was not until he tried vainly to see the gold\ncolors in the bottom of the pan that he realized the passage of time.\nHe straightened up abruptly. An expression of whimsical wonderment and\nawe overspread his face as he drawled:",
        "“Gosh darn my buttons! if I didn’t plumb forget dinner!”",
        "He stumbled across the stream in the darkness and lighted his\nlong-delayed fire. Flapjacks and bacon and warmed-over beans constituted\nhis supper. Then he smoked a pipe by the smouldering coals, listening to\nthe night noises and watching the moonlight stream through the canyon.\nAfter that he unrolled his bed, took off his heavy shoes, and pulled the\nblankets up to his chin. His face showed white in the moonlight, like\nthe face of a corpse. But it was a corpse that knew its resurrection,\nfor the man rose suddenly on one elbow and gazed across at his hillside.",
        "“Good night, Mr. Pocket,” he called sleepily. “Goodnight.”",
        "He slept through the early gray of morning until the direct rays of the\nsun smote his closed eyelids, when he awoke with a start and looked\nabout him until he had established the continuity of his existence and\nidentified his present self with the days previously lived.",
        "To dress, he had merely to buckle on his shoes. He glanced at his\nfireplace and at his hillside, wavered, but fought down the temptation\nand started the fire.",
        "“Keep yer shirt on, Bill; keep yer shirt on,” he admonished himself.\n“What’s the good of rushin’? No use in gettin’ all het up an’ sweaty.\nMr. Pocket’ll wait for you. He ain’t a-runnin’ away before you can get\nyour breakfast. Now, what you want, Bill, is something fresh in yer bill\no’ fare. So it’s up to you to go an’ get it.”",
        "He cut a short pole at the water’s edge and drew from one of his pockets\na bit of line and a draggled fly that had once been a royal coachman.",
        "“Mebbe they’ll bite in the early morning,” he muttered, as he made his\nfirst cast into the pool. And a moment later he was gleefully crying:\n“What’d I tell you, eh? What’d I tell you?”",
        "He had no reel, nor any inclination to waste time, and by main strength,\nand swiftly, he drew out of the water a flashing ten-inch trout. Three\nmore, caught in rapid succession, furnished his breakfast. When he came\nto the stepping-stones on his way to his hillside, he was struck by a\nsudden thought, and paused.",
        "“I’d just better take a hike down-stream a ways,” he said. “There’s no\ntellin’ who may be snoopin’ around.”",
        "But he crossed over on the stones, and with a “I really oughter take\nthat hike,” the need of the precaution passed out of his mind and he\nfell to work.",
        "At nightfall he straightened up. The small of his back was stiff from\nstooping toil, and as he put his hand behind him to soothe the\nprotesting muscles, he said:",
        "“Now what d’ye think of that? I clean forgot my dinner again! If I don’t\nwatch out, I’ll sure be degeneratin’ into a two-meal-a-day crank.”",
        "“Pockets is the hangedest things I ever see for makin’ a man\nabsent-minded,” he communed that night, as he crawled into his blankets.\nNor did he forget to call up the hillside, “Good night, Mr. Pocket! Good\nnight!”",
        "Rising with the sun, and snatching a hasty breakfast, he was early at\nwork. A fever seemed to be growing in him, nor did the increasing\nrichness of the test-pans allay this fever. There was a flush in his\ncheek other than that made by the heat of the sun, and he was oblivious\nto fatigue and the passage of time. When he filled a pan with dirt, he\nran down the hill to wash it; nor could he forbear running up the hill\nagain, panting and stumbling profanely, to refill the pan.",
        "He was now a hundred yards from the water, and the inverted “V” was\nassuming definite proportions. The width of the pay-dirt steadily\ndecreased, and the man extended in his mind’s eye the sides of the “V\"\nto their meeting place far up the hill. This was his goal, the apex of\nthe “V,” and he panned many times to locate it.",
        "“Just about two yards above that manzanita bush an’ a yard to the\nright,” he finally concluded.",
        "Then the temptation seized him. “As plain as the nose on your face,” he\nsaid, as he abandoned his laborious cross-cutting and climbed to the\nindicated apex. He filled a pan and carried it down the hill to wash. It\ncontained no trace of gold. He dug deep, and he dug shallow, filling\nand washing a dozen pans, and was unrewarded even by the tiniest golden\nspeck. He was enraged at having yielded to the temptation, and berated\nhimself blasphemously and pridelessly. Then he went down the hill and\ntook up the cross-cutting.",
        "“Slow an’ certain, Bill; slow an’ certain,” he crooned. “Short-cuts to\nfortune ain’t in your line, an’ it’s about time you know it. Get wise,\nBill; get wise. Slow an’ certain’s the only hand you can play; so go to\nit, an’ keep to it, too.”",
        "As the cross-cuts decreased, showing that the sides of the “V” were\nconverging, the depth of the “V” increased. The gold-trace was dipping\ninto the hill. It was only at thirty inches beneath the surface that he\ncould get colors in his pan. The dirt he found at twenty-five inches\nfrom the surface, and at thirty-five inches yielded barren pans. At the\nbase of the “V,” by the water’s edge, he had found the gold colors at\nthe grass roots. The higher he went up the hill, the deeper the gold\ndipped. To dig a hole three feet deep in order to get one test-pan was a\ntask of no mean magnitude; while between the man and the apex intervened\nan untold number of such holes to be dug. “An’ there’s no tellin’ how\nmuch deeper it’ll pitch,” he sighed, in a moment’s pause, while his\nfingers soothed his aching back.",
        "Feverish with desire, with aching back and stiffening muscles, with pick\nand shovel gouging and mauling the soft brown earth, the man toiled up\nthe hill. Before him was the smooth slope, spangled with flowers and\nmade sweet with their breath. Behind him was devastation. It looked like\nsome terrible eruption breaking out on the smooth skin of the hill. His\nslow progress was like that of a slug, befouling beauty with a monstrous\ntrail.",
        "Though the dipping gold-trace increased the man’s work, he found\nconsolation in the increasing richness of the pans. Twenty cents, thirty\ncents, fifty cents, sixty cents, were the values of the gold found in\nthe pans, and at nightfall he washed his banner pan, which gave him a\ndollar’s worth of gold-dust from a shovelful of dirt.",
        "“I’ll just bet it’s my luck to have some inquisitive one come buttin’ in\nhere on my pasture,” he mumbled sleepily that night as he pulled the\nblankets up to his chin.",
        "Suddenly he sat upright. “Bill!” he called sharply. “Now, listen to me,\nBill; d’ye hear! It’s up to you, to-morrow mornin’, to mosey round an’\nsee what you can see. Understand? To-morrow morning, an’ don’t you\nforget it!”",
        "He yawned and glanced across at his side-hill. “Good night, Mr. Pocket,\"\nhe called.",
        "In the morning he stole a march on the sun, for he had finished\nbreakfast when its first rays caught him, and he was climbing the wall\nof the canyon where it crumbled away and gave footing. From the outlook\nat the top he found himself in the midst of loneliness. As far as he\ncould see, chain after chain of mountains heaved themselves into his\nvision. To the east his eyes, leaping the miles between range and range\nand between many ranges, brought up at last against the white-peaked\nSierras–the main crest, where the backbone of the Western world reared\nitself against the sky. To the north and south he could see more\ndistinctly the cross-systems that broke through the main trend of the\nsea of mountains. To the west the ranges fell away, one behind the\nother, diminishing and fading into the gentle foothills that, in turn,\ndescended into the great valley which he could not see.",
        "And in all that mighty sweep of earth he saw no sign of man nor of the\nhandiwork of man–save only the torn bosom of the hillside at his feet.\nThe man looked long and carefully. Once, far down his own canyon, he\nthought he saw in the air a faint hint of smoke. He looked again and\ndecided that it was the purple haze of the hills made dark by a\nconvolution of the canyon wall at its back.",
        "“Hey, you, Mr. Pocket!” he called down into the canyon. “Stand out from\nunder! I’m a-comin’, Mr. Pocket! I’m a-comin’!”",
        "The heavy brogans on the man’s feet made him appear clumsy-footed, but\nhe swung down from the giddy height as lightly and airily as a mountain\ngoat. A rock, turning under his foot on the edge of the precipice, did\nnot disconcert him. He seemed to know the precise time required for the\nturn to culminate in disaster, and in the meantime he utilized the false\nfooting itself for the momentary earth-contact necessary to carry him on\ninto safety. Where the earth sloped so steeply that it was impossible to\nstand for a second upright, the man did not hesitate. His foot pressed\nthe impossible surface for but a fraction of the fatal second and gave\nhim the bound that carried him onward. Again, where even the fraction\nof a second’s footing was out of the question, he would swing his body\npast by a moment’s hand-grip on a jutting knob of rock, a crevice, or a\nprecariously rooted shrub. At last, with a wild leap and yell, he\nexchanged the face of the wall for an earth-slide and finished the\ndescent in the midst of several tons of sliding earth and gravel.",
        "His first pan of the morning washed out over two dollars in coarse gold.\nIt was from the centre of the “V.” To either side the diminution in the\nvalues of the pans was swift. His lines of cross-cutting holes were\ngrowing very short. The converging sides of the inverted “V” were only a\nfew yards apart. Their meeting-point was only a few yards above him. But\nthe pay-streak was dipping deeper and deeper into the earth. By early\nafternoon he was sinking the test-holes five feet before the pans could\nshow the gold-trace.",
        "For that matter, the gold-trace had become something more than a trace;\nit was a placer mine in itself, and the man resolved to come back after\nhe had found the pocket and work over the ground. But the increasing\nrichness of the pans began to worry him. By late afternoon the worth of\nthe pans had grown to three and four dollars. The man scratched his head\nperplexedly and looked a few feet up the hill at the manzanita bush that\nmarked approximately the apex of the “V.” He nodded his head and said\noracularly:",
        "“It’s one o’ two things, Bill: one o’ two things. Either Mr. Pocket’s\nspilled himself all out an’ down the hill, or else Mr. Pocket’s so rich\nyou maybe won’t be able to carry him all away with you. And that’d be an\nawful shame, wouldn’t it, now?” He chuckled at contemplation of so\npleasant a dilemma.",
        "Nightfall found him by the edge of the stream, his eyes wrestling with\nthe gathering darkness over the washing of a five-dollar pan.",
        "“Wisht I had an electric light to go on working,” he said.",
        "He found sleep difficult that night. Many times he composed himself and\nclosed his eyes for slumber to overtake him; but his blood pounded with\ntoo strong desire, and as many times his eyes opened and he murmured\nwearily, “Wisht it was sun-up.”",
        "Sleep came to him in the end, but his eyes were open with the first\npaling of the stars, and the gray of dawn caught him with breakfast\nfinished and climbing the hillside in the direction of the secret\nabiding-place of Mr. Pocket.",
        "The first cross-cut the man made, there was space for only three holes,\nso narrow had become the pay-streak and so close was he to the\nfountainhead of the golden stream he had been following for four days.",
        "“Be ca’m, Bill; be ca’m,” he admonished himself, as he broke ground for\nthe final hole where the sides of the “V” had at last come together in a\npoint.",
        "“I’ve got the almighty cinch on you, Mr. Pocket, an’ you can’t lose me,\"\nhe said many times as he sank the hole deeper and deeper.",
        "Four feet, five feet, six feet, he dug his way down into the earth. The\ndigging grew harder. His pick grated on broken rock. He examined the\nrock. “Rotten quartz,” was his conclusion as, with the shovel, he\ncleared the bottom of the hole of loose dirt. He attacked the crumbling\nquartz with the pick, bursting the disintegrating rock asunder with\nevery stroke.",
        "He thrust his shovel into the loose mass. His eye caught a gleam of\nyellow. He dropped the shovel and squatted suddenly on his heels. As a\nfarmer rubs the clinging earth from fresh-dug potatoes, so the man, a\npiece of rotten quartz held in both hands, rubbed the dirt away.",
        "“Sufferin’ Sardanopolis!” he cried. “Lumps an’ chunks of it! Lumps an’\nchunks of it!”",
        "It was only half rock he held in his hand. The other half was virgin\ngold. He dropped it into his pan and examined another piece. Little\nyellow was to be seen, but with his strong fingers he crumbled the\nrotten quartz away till both hands were filled with glowing yellow. He\nrubbed the dirt away from fragment after fragment, tossing them into the\ngold-pan. It was a treasure-hole. So much had the quartz rotted away\nthat there was less of it than there was of gold. Now and again he found\na piece to which no rock clung–a piece that was all gold. A chunk,\nwhere the pick had laid open the heart of the gold, glittered like a\nhandful of yellow jewels, and he cocked his head at it and slowly turned\nit around and over to observe the rich play of the light upon it.",
        "“Talk about yer Too Much Gold diggin’s!” the man snorted contemptuously.\n“Why, this diggin’ ’d make it look like thirty cents. This diggin’ is\nAll Gold. An’ right here an’ now I name this yere canyon ’All Gold\nCanyon,’ b’ gosh!”",
        "Still squatting on his heels, he continued examining the fragments and\ntossing them into the pan. Suddenly there came to him a premonition of\ndanger. It seemed a shadow had fallen upon him. But there was no shadow.\nHis heart had given a great jump up into his throat and was choking him.\nThen his blood slowly chilled and he felt the sweat of his shirt cold\nagainst his flesh.",
        "He did not spring up nor look around. He did not move. He was\nconsidering the nature of the premonition he had received, trying to\nlocate the source of the mysterious force that had warned him, striving\nto sense the imperative presence of the unseen thing that threatened\nhim. There is an aura of things hostile, made manifest by messengers too\nrefined for the senses to know; and this aura he felt, but knew not how\nhe felt it. His was the feeling as when a cloud passes over the sun. It\nseemed that between him and life had passed something dark and\nsmothering and menacing; a gloom, as it were, that swallowed up life and\nmade for death–his death.",
        "Every force of his being impelled him to spring up and confront the\nunseen danger, but his soul dominated the panic, and he remained\nsquatting on his heels, in his hands a chunk of gold. He did not dare to\nlook around, but he knew by now that there was something behind him and\nabove him. He made believe to be interested in the gold in his hand. He\nexamined it critically, turned it over and over, and rubbed the dirt\nfrom it. And all the time he knew that something behind him was looking\nat the gold over his shoulder.",
        "Still feigning interest in the chunk of gold in his hand, he listened\nintently and he heard the breathing of the thing behind him. His eyes\nsearched the ground in front of him for a weapon, but they saw only the\nuprooted gold, worthless to him now in his extremity. There was his\npick, a handy weapon on occasion; but this was not such an occasion. The\nman realized his predicament. He was in a narrow hole that was seven\nfeet deep. His head did not come to the surface of the ground. He was in\na trap.",
        "He remained squatting on his heels. He was quite cool and collected; but\nhis mind, considering every factor, showed him only his helplessness.\nHe continued rubbing the dirt from the quartz fragments and throwing the\ngold into the pan. There was nothing else for him to do. Yet he knew\nthat he would have to rise up, sooner or later, and face the danger that\nbreathed at his back. The minutes passed, and with the passage of each\nminute he knew that by so much he was nearer the time when he must stand\nup, or else–and his wet shirt went cold against his flesh again at the\nthought–or else he might receive death as he stooped there over his\ntreasure.",
        "Still he squatted on his heels, rubbing dirt from gold and debating in\njust what manner he should rise up. He might rise up with a rush and\nclaw his way out of the hole to meet whatever threatened on the even\nfooting above ground. Or he might rise up slowly and carelessly, and\nfeign casually to discover the thing that breathed at his back. His\ninstinct and every fighting fibre of his body favored the mad, clawing\nrush to the surface. His intellect, and the craft thereof, favored the\nslow and cautious meeting with the thing that menaced and which he could\nnot see. And while he debated, a loud, crashing noise burst on his ear.\nAt the same instant he received a stunning blow on the left side of the\nback, and from the point of impact felt a rush of flame through his\nflesh. He sprang up in the air, but halfway to his feet collapsed. His\nbody crumpled in like a leaf withered in sudden heat, and he came down,\nhis chest across his pan of gold, his face in the dirt and rock, his\nlegs tangled and twisted because of the restricted space at the bottom\nof the hole. His legs twitched convulsively several times. His body was\nshaken as with a mighty ague. There was a slow expansion of the lungs,\naccompanied by a deep sigh. Then the air was slowly, very slowly,\nexhaled, and his body as slowly flattened itself down into inertness.",
        "Above, revolver in hand, a man was peering down over the edge of the\nhole. He peered for a long time at the prone and motionless body beneath\nhim. After a while the stranger sat down on the edge of the hole so that\nhe could see into it, and rested the revolver on his knee. Reaching his\nhand into a pocket, he drew out a wisp of brown paper. Into this he\ndropped a few crumbs of tobacco. The combination became a cigarette,\nbrown and squat, with the ends turned in. Not once did he take his eyes\nfrom the body at the bottom of the hole. He lighted the cigarette and\ndrew its smoke into his lungs with a caressing intake of the breath. He\nsmoked slowly. Once the cigarette went out and he relighted it. And all\nthe while he studied the body beneath him.",
        "In the end he tossed the cigarette stub away and rose to his feet. He\nmoved to the edge of the hole. Spanning it, a hand resting on each edge,\nand with the revolver still in the right hand, he muscled his body down\ninto the hole. While his feet were yet a yard from the bottom he\nreleased his hands and dropped down.",
        "At the instant his feet struck bottom he saw the pocket-miner’s arm leap\nout, and his own legs knew a swift, jerking grip that overthrew him. In\nthe nature of the jump his revolver hand was above his head. Swiftly as\nthe grip had flashed about his legs, just as swiftly he brought the\nrevolver down. He was still in the air, his fall in process of\ncompletion, when he pulled the trigger. The explosion was deafening in\nthe confined space. The smoke filled the hole so that he could see\nnothing. He struck the bottom on his back, and like a cat’s the\npocket-miner’s body was on top of him. Even as the miner’s body passed\non top, the stranger crooked in his right arm to fire; and even in that\ninstant the miner, with a quick thrust of elbow, struck his wrist. The\nmuzzle was thrown up and the bullet thudded into the dirt of the side of\nthe hole.",
        "The next instant the stranger felt the miner’s hand grip his wrist. The\nstruggle was now for the revolver. Each man strove to turn it against\nthe other’s body. The smoke in the hole was clearing. The stranger,\nlying on his back, was beginning to see dimly. But suddenly he was\nblinded by a handful of dirt deliberately flung into his eyes by his\nantagonist. In that moment of shock his grip on the revolver was broken.\nIn the next moment he felt a smashing darkness descend upon his brain,\nand in the midst of the darkness even the darkness ceased.",
        "But the pocket-miner fired again and again, until the revolver was\nempty. Then he tossed it from him and, breathing heavily, sat down on\nthe dead man’s legs.",
        "The miner was sobbing and struggling for breath. “Measly skunk!” he\npanted; “a-campin’ on my trail an’ lettin’ me do the work, an’ then\nshootin’ me in the back!”",
        "He was half crying from anger and exhaustion. He peered at the face of\nthe dead man. It was sprinkled with loose dirt and gravel, and it was\ndifficult to distinguish the features.",
        "“Never laid eyes on him before,” the miner concluded his scrutiny. “Just\na common an’ ordinary thief, hang him! An’ he shot me in the back! He\nshot me in the back!”",
        "He opened his shirt and felt himself, front and back, on his left side.",
        "“Went clean through, and no harm done!” he cried jubilantly. “I’ll bet\nhe aimed all right all right; but he drew the gun over when he pulled\nthe trigger–the cur! But I fixed ’m! Oh, I fixed ’m!”",
        "His fingers were investigating the bullet-hole in his side, and a shade\nof regret passed over his face. “It’s goin’ to be stiffer’n hell,” he\nsaid. “An’ it’s up to me to get mended an’ get out o’here.”",
        "He crawled out of the hole and went down the hill to his camp. Half an\nhour later he returned, leading his pack-horse. His open shirt\ndisclosed the rude bandages with which he had dressed his wound. He was\nslow and awkward with his left-hand movements, but that did not prevent\nhis using the arm.",
        "The bight of the pack-rope under the dead man’s shoulders enabled him to\nheave the body out of the hole. Then he set to work gathering up his\ngold. He worked steadily for several hours, pausing often to rest his\nstiffening shoulder and to exclaim:",
        "“He shot me in the back, the measly skunk! He shot me in the back!”",
        "When his treasure was quite cleaned up and wrapped securely into a\nnumber of blanket-covered parcels, he made an estimate of its value.",
        "“Four hundred pounds, or I’m a Hottentot,” he concluded. “Say two\nhundred in quartz an’ dirt–that leaves two hundred pounds of gold.\nBill! Wake up! Two hundred pounds of gold! Forty thousand dollars! An’\nit’s yourn–all yourn!”",
        "He scratched his head delightedly and his fingers blundered into an\nunfamiliar groove. They quested along it for several inches. It was a\ncrease through his scalp where the second bullet had ploughed.",
        "He walked angrily over to the dead man.",
        "“You would, would you!” he bullied. “You would, eh? Well, I fixed you\ngood an’ plenty, an’ I’ll give you decent burial, too. That’s more’n\nyou’d have done for me.”",
        "He dragged the body to the edge of the hole and toppled it in. It struck\nthe bottom with a dull crash, on its side, the face twisted up to the\nlight. The miner peered down at it.",
        "“An’ you shot me in the back!” he said accusingly.",
        "With pick and shovel he filled the hole. Then he loaded the gold on his\nhorse. It was too great a load for the animal, and when he had gained\nhis camp he transferred part of it to his saddle-horse. Even so, he was\ncompelled to abandon a portion of his outfit–pick and shovel and\ngold-pan, extra food and cooking utensils, and divers odds and ends.",
        "The sun was at the zenith when the man forced the horses at the screen\nof vines and creepers. To climb the huge boulders the animals were\ncompelled to uprear and struggle blindly through the tangled mass of\nvegetation. Once the saddle-horse fell heavily and the man removed the\npack to get the animal on its feet. After it started on its way again\nthe man thrust his head out from among the leaves and peered up at the\nhillside.",
        "“The measly skunk!” he said, and disappeared.",
        "There was a ripping and tearing of vines and boughs. The trees surged\nback and forth, marking the passage of the animals through the midst of\nthem. There was a clashing of steel-shod hoofs on stone, and now and\nagain a sharp cry of command. Then the voice of the man was raised in\nsong:–",
        "   “Tu’n around an’ tu’n yo’ face\n   Untoe them sweet hills of grace\n     (D’ pow’rs of sin yo’ am scornin’!).\n   Look about an’ look aroun’\n   Fling yo’ sin-pack on d’ groun’\n     (Yo’-will meet wid d’ Lord in d’ mornin’!).”",
        "The song grew faint and fainter, and through the silence crept back the\nspirit of the place. The stream once more drowsed and whispered; the hum\nof the mountain bees rose sleepily. Down through the perfume-weighted\nair fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods. The butterflies\ndrifted in and out among the trees, and over all blazed the quiet\nsunshine. Only remained the hoof-marks in the meadow and the torn\nhillside to mark the boisterous trail of the life that had broken the\npeace of the place and passed on.",
