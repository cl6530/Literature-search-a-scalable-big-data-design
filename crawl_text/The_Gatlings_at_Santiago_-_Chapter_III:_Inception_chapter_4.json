        "The Ordnance Depot at Tampa was located on Lafayette Street, at the\nend of the bridge over the river, next to the Tampa Bay Hotel. The\nriver washed the sides of the building, which was occupied by the\nTampa Athletic Club, and had formerly been used as a club-house. There\nwere two stories and a basement. The basement was nearly on a level\nwith the river, the main floor on a level with the bridge, and there\nwas also a spacious upper floor. The main floor was used for storage\nof light articles of ordnance; the basement for heavy articles and\nammunition. Hundreds of thousands of rounds of rifle and revolver ball\ncartridges, thousands of rounds of Hotchkiss fixed ammunition, and\nmany hundreds of pounds of powder charges for field artillery and\nmortars were here stored. Miscellaneous assortments were daily coming\nin, generally without any mark on the box by which to learn what were\nthe contents. The name of the arsenal, if from an arsenal, was usually\nstamped on the seal; generally there was no mark whatever to designate\nthe origin or contents of the many boxes which came from ordinary\nposts. The invoices came from a week to ten days behind or in advance\nof the arrival of the boxes, and there was not the slightest clue to\nbe gained from them. Consequently those who had to check up invoices\nand prepare for issues were at their wits’ end to keep things\nstraight. A requisition for so many articles would come in, duly\napproved; unless the boxes containing these articles happened to have\nbeen unpacked, it was uncertain whether they were on hand or not. No\nwholesale merchant of any sense would ship out boxes of goods without\nsome indication of their contents; but that was exactly what was done\nfrom all over the country to the Ordnance Depot at Tampa.",
        "The upper floor consisted of one large room. A rope railing was placed\naround it to preserve clear space around the desks. There were several\nof these for the ordnance officer and the various clerks. A chief\nclerk, an assistant clerk, a stenographer, and two ordnance sergeants\nlooked after the red tape. An overseer with four subordinates and a\ngang of negro stevedores attended to loading and unloading boxes,\nstoring them, counting out articles for issue or receipt, and such\nother duties as they were called on to perform. There was an old\njanitor named McGee, a veteran of the Civil War, whose business it was\nto look after the sweeping and keep the floors clean.",
        "Four guns in their original boxes were issued to the detachment on the\n27th of May. They were new, and apparently had never been assembled.\nOn assembling them it was found that the parts had been constructed\nwith such “scientific” accuracy that the use of a mallet was\nnecessary. The binder-box on the pointing lever was so tight that in\nattempting to depress the muzzle of the gun it was possible to lift\nthe trail off the ground before the binder-box would slide on the\nlever. The axis-pin had to be driven in and out with an axe, using a\nblock of wood, of course, to prevent battering. A truly pretty state\nof affairs for a gun the value of which depends on the ease with which\nit can be pointed in any direction.",
        "Inquiry after the war at the factory where the guns are made disclosed\nthe fact that these parts are rigidly tested by a gauge by the\nGovernment inspectors, and that looseness is regarded as a fatal\ndefect. Even play of half a hundredth of an inch is enough to insure\nthe rejection of a piece. The very first thing done by the Gatling Gun\nDetachment, upon assembling these guns, was to obtain a set of\narmorers’ tools and to file away these parts by hand until the aim of\nthe piece could be changed by the touch of a feather. The detachment\nwas ordered to rely upon the friction clutches for steadiness of aim,\nwhen necessary, and not upon the tight fit of the parts. It was\nordered that there must be no doubt whatever of easy, perfectly free\nmanipulation at any and all times, even if the pointing lever should\nbecome rusted. This precaution proved on July 1st to have been of\ngreat value.",
        "The instruction of the detachment began immediately, and consisted, at\nfirst, of unpacking, mounting, dismounting, and repacking the guns.\nThe four guns were mounted and a drill held each time in the loading\nand firing of the piece. This system of instruction was continued\nuntil the detachment was ordered on board ship on the 6th of June.\nDuring this instruction members of the detachment were designated by\nname to fall out, and the remainder of the detachment required to\nexecute all the maneuvers of the piece as before. In fact, this\ninstruction was carried to such a point that one man alone was\nrequired to load, aim, and fire the gun at designated objects without\nany assistance.",
        "The detachment at once assumed the position of an independent command.\nIt reported directly to Maj.-Gen. W. R. Shafter, commanding the 5th\nCorps, in everything so far as its duties with Gatling guns were\nconcerned, was regarded as an independent command, kept its own\nrecords in the same manner as a company, obtained cooking utensils\nfrom the quartermaster and ran its own mess, and furnished its own\nguard. This status, that of a separate command, continued until the\ndetachment was finally disbanded at Montauk.",
        "On the 27th of May the detachment commander was summoned to Gen.\nWheeler’s headquarters and there requested to explain to the general\nin person his plans for organizing a Gatling gun detachment. Gen.\nWheeler had just assumed command of all the Cavalry belonging to the\n5th Army Corps. His headquarters, instead of being in a suite of rooms\nin the palatial Tampa Bay Hotel, where all the other general officers\nhad their headquarters, were located about half a mile from the hotel\nin a treeless pasture. The cavalry guidon floating from a lance-head\nwas the only indication of headquarters, and the half-dozen “A” tents\nin an irregular line gave no sign that one of the most distinguished\ngenerals in the world had here his headquarters in the field.",
        "The general was easily accessible. The first thing that impressed one\nof him was his extraordinary quickness. His eye seemed to take in\neverything within sight of him at a single glance, and to read one’s\nthoughts before the tongue could give expression to them. He grasped\nideas when they were only half uttered and immediately drew deductions\nfrom mere statements of simple facts, the result of years of careful\nstudy. These deductions, which Gen. Wheeler drew instantly, were in\nevery case correct, and showed a keener and more correct appreciation\nof the proper tactical employment of machine guns than was shown by\nany other officer of the 5th Corps. The result of the interview with\nthe general was that a scheme for the organization of a tactical unit\nto be composed of three Gatling guns and to be employed with the\ncavalry division, was drawn up on the spot, under Gen. Wheeler’s\npersonal direction, and was submitted by him to Gen. Shafter, with the\nrequest that authority be granted for the organization of this command\nfor the purpose indicated.",
        "In the application Gen. Wheeler stated that he believed that such a\nbattery of machine guns, if properly handled, could go anywhere that\ncavalry could go, could take the place of infantry supports, could\ndash up and hold any ground or advantageous position that a body of\ncavalry might seize, could be thrown out to one flank of the enemy and\nassist in his demoralization in preparation for the cavalry charge,\nand would be of particular service in case the enemy attempted to form\ninfantry squares, which were at that time supposed to be the main part\nof the Spanish tactics of battle. This application was disapproved.",
        "On the 30th of May, Gen. Lee sent for the detachment commander for an\ninterview on the subject of Gatling guns. Gen. Lee was at this time\nquartered at the Tampa Bay Hotel, and was engaged in the organization\nof the 7th Army Corps. It was supposed that the 7th Corps was designed\nfor the Havana campaign, and it was believed that the attack upon\nHavana would begin at a very early date. The result of the interview\nwith Gen. Lee was that he directed a scheme for the organization of a\ntactical unit to be composed of 9 guns, 3 batteries of 3 guns each, to\nbe prepared for service with the 7th Army Corps.",
        "It was desired that this organization be a volunteer organization, and\nthe application was therefore made for authority from the President,\nunder that law of Congress authorizing the employment of special\ntroops. Col. Guild, well and favorably known from his connection with\nthe Massachusetts National Guard, was prepared to furnish a volunteer\norganization already in existence, well drilled and already officered,\ncomposed of the flower of the youth of Massachusetts, very largely of\ncollege graduates, who had already been communicated with on the\nsubject, and who were even at that time expecting momentarily a\ntelegram calling them to this duty. Nothing resulted from this effort.",
        "Meantime the drill instruction of the little detachment continued. Its\nmembers had acquired a considerable degree of proficiency in the\nmechanical handling of their guns, and were beginning to appreciate\nthe destructive possibilities of their weapon. They were enjoying a\ndegree of liberty which they had not found in their regimental camp,\nbecause when not on duty they were free to come and go at will, when\nand where they pleased. The hours for instruction were designated in\nthe morning and in the cool of the afternoon, leaving the middle of\nthe day and the evening for the men’s own recreation. The result of\nthis system of treatment was that esprit-du-corps began to be\ndeveloped in the detachment. They began to feel that they were a\nspecial organization, expected to do special work, and that they were\nreceiving very special treatment. They began to be proud of being\nmembers of the Gatling Gun Detachment, to take greater interest in the\nwork, and when on the first of June they received their monthly pay\nnot a single member of the detachment committed any excesses in\nconsequence of this unusual degree of freedom. No one was intoxicated.\nNo one was absent without permission.",
        "The detachment had not been at the Ordnance Depot very long before an\nopportunity occurred for some of its members to exhibit those\nqualities which made the success of the battery so conspicuous on the\nbattle-field afterward. The detachment commander had been detailed by\nverbal orders on the first of June in charge of the issues of ordnance\nproperty to the Santiago expedition. This was in addition to his\nduties with the Gatling guns. The work would commence about 6 o’clock\nin the morning, and from that time until dark there was a continual\nstream of wagons carrying away stores such as rifles, haversacks, meat\nration cans, tin cups, and all the articles needed by troops in the\nfield during a campaign. The ammunition which was issued to the troops\nat this time was drawn at the same place.",
        "When wagons arrived to receive issues, stevedores were directed to\ncount out the different articles under the direction of an overseer,\nand these piles of articles were verified by the officer in charge of\nthe issues. The stevedores then loaded them on the wagons which were\nto haul them to the different camps. Receipts in duplicate were always\ntaken and invoices in duplicate were always given, in the name, of\ncourse, of Lieut. John T. Thompson, who was responsible for the\nstores.",
        "On the 4th of June issues were being made of rifle-ball cartridges.\nThese cartridges came packed in boxes of 1000 rounds each, and each\nbox weighed 78 pounds. A great quantity of it was stored in the\nbasement, where there was also a considerable quantity of fixed\nHotchkiss ammunition, as well as several thousand rounds of powder\ncharges in boxes. The Hotchkiss ammunition, which comes with\nprojectile and powder both set in a brass case, is bad ammunition to\npack; for, no matter how carefully it is handled, there is almost\nalways some leakage of powder from the cartridge case, thus causing a\ncertain amount of loose powder to sift into the box in which it is\npacked.",
        "About half past 11 o’clock on this morning a negro stevedore\naccidentally dropped a box of rifle ammunition near a pile of\nHotchkiss fixed, and the next instant the laborers saw smoke ascending\ntoward the ceiling of the basement. They yelled “Fire! fire!” at the\ntop of their voices, and everybody in the basement at once made a rush\nfor the two doors. It was a panic. The danger was imminent. The smoke\ncurled up to the ceiling and then curled down again, and the excited,\npanic-stricken faces of the negroes as they rushed through the door\nmade an awful picture of human terror. People on the outside of the\nbuilding began to shout “Fire!”",
        "At this juncture McGee, the old janitor, who had just reached the\ndoor, cried out, “Lieutenant, there is a box in here on fire!\"\nspeaking to Lieut. Parker, who was verifying issues just outside the\ndoor. The lieutenant replied, “Let’s throw it into the river,” and\ndashed toward the box through the door, pushing the excited negroes to\neach side in order to assist McGee, who had instantly started for the\nbox. When Lieut. Parker reached the box, he found that McGee had\nalready taken it up, and was staggering under its weight. He placed\none arm around McGee’s shoulder and with the other assisted him to\nsupport the box, from which the smoke was still ascending, and the two\nrushed for the door, throwing the whole momentum of their weight and\nspeed against the crowd of frightened negroes, who were falling over\neach other in their panic-stricken efforts to escape. Priv. Greenberg,\nof the 13th Infantry, a member of the Gatling Gun Detachment, who was\nthe sentinel on post at the time, saw the two men coming with the box,\nand with great presence of mind added his own weight with a rapid rush\nto the shock they had produced, thus enabling them to break their way\nthrough the dense throng at the door. It was only the work of an\ninstant to then throw the box in the river, where it sank in the water\nand for a moment the blue smoke continued to bubble up from the box,\nwhich lay clearly visible on the bed of the river, the water being\nonly about two feet deep at this point, which was, however, enough to\nentirely cover the box and thus extinguish the fire. At the outcry of\n“Fire!” Lieut. H. L. Kinnison, of the 25th Infantry, who was waiting\noutside of the basement with a wagon, started in at the other door,\nand Serg. Weischaar, acting first sergeant of the Gatling Gun\nDetachment, started for water. Just as the two men emerged from the\ndoor carrying the box, Lieut. Kinnison reached the spot where the fire\nhad originated, and Serg. Weischaar appeared with two buckets of\nwater. He and Lieut. Kinnison at once flooded the floor, seized a\nwoolen cloth which happened to be near, and wetted down the boxes of\nHotchkiss ammunition as a measure of precaution.",
        "McGee, the hero of this episode, is an old veteran of the Civil War,\nhaving served three years in the Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry\nduring the war, and five years in the Regular Army after the war. He\nhas never drawn a pension nor applied for one, although he suffers\nconsiderably from disease and wounds contracted and received during\nthe war, and certainly should be rewarded by a grateful government for\nhis conspicuous heroism. The explosion of this magazine would have\nbrought the whole expedition to a standstill, besides inflicting\ntremendous destruction of property and frightful loss of life.",
        "The same day the Artillery of the army began to draw its material for\nthe campaign, and for a period of thirty-nine hours there was no rest\nfor anybody connected with the issue of ordnance stores. It was at\nthis time that the lack of intelligent marking and packing of the\nboxes was keenly felt. The greatest difficulty was experienced in\nselecting, from the mass of stores in the depot, the stores that were\nrequired by the Artillery. It was especially difficult during the work\nby night, when the only light that could possibly be allowed was a\nsingle lantern, on account of the danger of fire.",
        "At the close of this thirty-nine hours of arduous duty, the officer in\ncommand of the Gatling Gun Detachment learned that orders had been\nissued for the embarkation of the 5th Army Corps at Port Tampa, and\nthat no reference had been made to the Gatling Gun Detachment in these\norders. He at once sought Lieut. Thompson, who could offer no light on\nthe omission, but said, “I have orders to send at once to the\nCherokee 521,000 rounds of rifle-ball cartridges and all the\nrevolver ammunition on hand. This is the reserve ammunition of the 5th\nArmy Corps. I will send you in charge of this ammunition and you will\nsee it to its destination. You may take an escort or not, as you\nplease. The ammunition is to go on the 4 o’clock train and you must\nmake all the arrangements in regard to it. Get box-cars, haul the\nammunition over there and put it in the cars, see that it goes on that\ntrain, and as soon as it arrives at Port Tampa, see that it is\nproperly put on board the Cherokee.”",
        "In order to fully understand the situation of the Gatling Gun\nDetachment at this juncture, the following correspondence on the\nsubject is necessary:",
        "“Office of Ordnance Officer,\n“Lafayette Street, West of Bridge,\n“Tampa, Fla., June 3, 1898.",
        "“The Assistant Adjutant-General, 5th Army Corps, Tampa,\nFlorida:",
        "“Sir,–Replying to your letter of June 1,1898, in reference to Gatling\nGun Detachment, I have the honor to submit the following report:",
        "Guns, men, and equipment required for a 4-gun detachment:",
        "                   Guns. Serg. Corp. Priv.\n  Total required:      4     5     4    28\n  On hand:             4     2     0    10\n  Required:                  3     4    18",
        "The gun crews thus organized will give most effective service for the\ndetachment.",
        "Ammunition: Each limber carries 9,840 rounds cal. .30. Four limbers,\n27,360; necessary reserve, 32,640; total, 60,000.",
        "Tentage: Two conical wall-tents for enlisted men; one ’A’ wall-tent\nfor officer.",
        "Camp equipage, in addition to that on hand in Gatling Gun Detachment:\none buzzacot, small; four mess-pans, one dish-pan, one coffee-mill.",
        "Blanket-roll complete; revolver with 50 rounds per man; waist-belts\nand entrenching-knives.",
        "“It is recommended that Priv. Butz, ’G’ Co., 13th Infantry, Corp.\nRobert S. Smith, ’C’ Co., 13th Infantry, and Serg. Weigle, 9th\nInfantry, be members of the detachment; and that detachment be taken\nfrom 9th Infantry, which has some well-instructed men.",
        "“It is further recommended that the detachment be fully horsed as soon\nas practicable, and that the whole be placed under the command of\nLieut. John H. Parker, 13th Infantry, as acting captain.",
        "“I recommend that I be authorized to issue the 4 Gatling guns and\nparts to him.",
        "“The details should carry the rations prescribed in General Orders\n5th, May 31, 1898, 5th Army Corps. Very respectfully,",
        "(Signed) “Jno. T. Thompson,\n“1st Lieut., Ord. Dept, U. S. A.”",
        "This letter, prepared by Lieut. Parker and signed by Lieut. Thompson,\nwas endorsed as follows:",
        "First Endorsement.",
        "“Headquarters 5th Army Corps,\n“Tampa, Fla., June 5, 1898.",
        "“Respectfully returned to Lieut. J. T. Thompson, Ordnance Officer.",
        "“If Lieut. Parker, in charge of the detachment as at present\nconstituted, can make the arrangements suggested within, he may take\naction; but, in view of the limited time remaining, it is thought the\ndetachment already organized will answer.",
        "“By command of Maj.-Gen. Shafter.",
        "“E. J. McClernand,\n“Assistant Adjutant-General.”",
        "Second Endorsement.",
        "“Office of the Ordnance Officer,\n“Lafayette Street Bridge,\n“Tampa, Fla., June 5, 1898.",
        "“Respectfully referred to Lieut. John H. Parker for his information.",
        "“Jno. T. Thompson,\n“1st Lieut., Ordnance Dept, U. S. A.”",
        "It will be seen from the first endorsement that a certain amount of\ndiscretion was left to the detachment commander. He was authorized to\ntake action if he could make the arrangements suggested within. Lieut.\nThompson had authorized an escort for the reserve ammunition, if it\nwas considered necessary. The detachment commander resolved to take\naction by using his whole detachment as an escort, putting it on board\nthe Cherokee, with the reserve ammunition, and accompanying it to its\ndestination–in Cuba, trusting to the future to enable him to complete\nthe detachment according to the first endorsement.",
        "It was now 11 o’clock in the forenoon. Between that time and 4 o’clock\nit was necessary to obtain two freight cars, have them placed upon the\nsiding at a convenient point, have more than twenty wagon-loads of\nammunition, camp equipage, etc., placed in these cars, have the four\nguns with their limbers placed on board, and, more difficult than all\nthe rest, go through the necessary red tape at the quartermaster’s\noffice in order to get the two cars moved to Port Tampa. It was all\naccomplished.",
        "The general freight agent was bluffed into believing that unless the\ntwo cars were instantly set where they were wanted his whole railroad\nwould be tied up. The quartermaster was hypnotized and dropped\nformality, putting all the clerks to work upon papers and making out\nthe necessary bill of lading, invoices, etc., in time to catch the 4\no’clock train. He also issued the necessary transportation for the\nofficer and men of the detachment from Tampa to Port Tampa, accepting\nthe first endorsement above as sufficient orders for that purpose.",
        "One member of the detachment, Priv. Murray, had been very ill with\nwhat we afterward learned to call the Cuban fever, and, while\napparently convalescent, was entirely too weak to accompany the\ndetachment. He was a splendid fellow, and the tears rolled down his\nemaciated face when he was told he must remain behind. He was\nfurnished with a descriptive list and a letter was written to the\nchief surgeon of the Division Hospital, requesting him to send an\nambulance immediately for the sick man. One member of the detachment\ncarried this letter to Tampa Heights, and so sharp was the work of\ngetting away that this man had to board a moving train as it was\npulling out to keep from getting left; but Priv. Murray was taken to\nthe hospital and cared for, and Priv. Bremer did not get left.",
        "The detachment reached Port Tampa about sundown, and Maj. Cushing, who\nhad charge of the loading of the transports, at once authorized the\ncars to be set alongside the Cherokee. The ammunition, guns, camp\nequipage, men, and all were promptly put aboard. The training in\npacking and unpacking the guns was the only thing which enabled the\nwork to be done in the limited time allotted. Not so much as a\nten-penny nail belonging to the detachment was left behind.",
        "During the night the troops that were to occupy the Cherokee came on\nboard, and it was found the next morning that five or six tons of\nregimental baggage had been piled on top of the guns, making it\npractically impossible to disembark, even if such a movement should be\nordered.",
