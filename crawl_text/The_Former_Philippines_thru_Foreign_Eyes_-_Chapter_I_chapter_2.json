        "[Difference from European time.] When the clock strikes twelve in\nMadrid, [1] it is 8 hours, 18 minutes, and 41 seconds past eight\nin the evening at Manila; that is to say, the latter city lies 124°\n40’ 15’’ to the east of the former (7 hours, 54 minutes, 35 seconds\nfrom Paris). Some time ago, however, while the new year was being\ncelebrated in Madrid, it was only New Year’s eve at Manila.",
        "[Magellan’s mistake in reckoning.] As Magellan, who discovered the\nPhilippines in his memorable first circumnavigation of the globe,\nwas following the sun in its apparent daily path around the world,\nevery successive degree he compassed on his eastern course added\nfour minutes to the length of his day; and, when he reached the\nPhilippines, the difference amounted to sixteen hours. This, however,\napparently escaped his notice, for Elcano, the captain of the only\nremaining vessel, was quite unaware, on his return to the longitude\nof his departure, why according to his ship’s log-book, he was a day\nbehind the time of the port which he had reached again by continuously\nsailing westward. [2] [3]",
        "[Change to the Asian day.] The error remained also unheeded in the\nPhilippines. It was still, over there the last day of the old year,\nwhile the rest of the world was commencing the new one; and this state\nof things continued till the close of 1844, when it was resolved,\nwith the approval of the archbishop, to pass over New Year’s eve for\nonce altogether. [4] Since that time the Philippines are considered\nto lie no longer in the distant west, but in the far east, and are\nabout eight hours in advance of their mother country. The proper field\nfor their commerce, however, is what is to Europeans the far west;\nthey were colonized thence, and for centuries, till 1811, they had\nalmost no other communication with Europe but the indirect one by\nthe annual voyage of the galleon between Manila and Acapulco. Now,\nhowever, when the eastern shores of the Pacific are at last beginning\nto teem with life, and, with unexampled speed, are pressing forward to\ngrasp their stupendous future, the Philippines will no longer be able\nto remain in their past seclusion. No tropical Asiatic colony is so\nfavorably situated for communication with the west coast of America,\nand it is only in a few matters that the Dutch Indies can compete with\nthem for the favors of the Australian market. But, [Future in American\nand Australian trade.] on the other hand, they will have to abandon\ntheir traffic with China, whose principal emporium Manila originally\nwas, as well as that with those westward-looking countries of Asia,\nEurope’s far east, which lie nearest to the Atlantic ports.  [5] [6]",
        "[Commercially in the New World.] When the circumstances mentioned\ncome to be realized, the Philippines, or, at any rate, the principal\nmarket for their commerce, will finally fall within the limits of\nthe western hemisphere, to which indeed they were relegated by the\nillustrious Spanish geographers at Badajoz.",
        "[The Pope’s world-partitive.] The Bull issued by Alexander VI, [7]\non May 4, 1493, which divided the earth into two hemispheres, decreed\nthat all heathen lands discovered in the eastern half should belong\nto the Portuguese; in the western half to the Spaniards. According to\nthis arrangement, the latter could only claim the Philippines under\nthe pretext that they were situated in the western hemisphere. The\ndemarcation line was to run from the north to the south, a hundred\nleagues to the south-west of all the so-called Azores and Cape\nde Verde Islands. In accordance with the treaty of Tordesillas,\nnegotiated between Spain and Portugal on June 7, 1494, and approved\nby Julius II, in 1506, this line was drawn three hundred and seventy\nleagues west of the Cape de Verde Islands.",
        "[Faulty Spanish and Portuguese geography.] At that time Spanish and\nPortuguese geographers reckoned seventeen and one-half leagues to a\ndegree on the equator. In the latitude of the Cape de Verde Islands,\nthree hundred and seventy leagues made 21° 55’. If to this we add\nthe longitudinal difference between the westernmost point of the\ngroup and Cadiz, a difference of 18° 48’, we get 40° 43’ west, and\n139° 17’ east from Cadiz (in round numbers 47° west and 133° east),\nas the limits of the Spanish hemisphere. At that time, however,\nthe existing means for such calculations were entirely insufficient.",
        "[Extravagant Spanish claims thru ignorance.] The latitude was measured\nwith imperfect astrolabes, or wooden quadrants, and calculated from\nvery deficient tables; the variation of the compass, moreover, was\nalmost unknown, as well as the use of the log. [8] Both method and\ninstruments were wanting for useful longitudinal calculations. It was\nunder these circumstances that the Spaniards attempted, at Badajoz,\nto prove to the protesting Portuguese that the eastern boundary line\nintersected the mouths of the Ganges, and proceeded to lay claim to\nthe possession of the Spice Islands.",
        "[Spain’s error in calculation.] The eastern boundary should, in\nreality, have been drawn 46 1/2° further to the east, that is to\nsay, as much further as it is from Berlin to the coast of Labrador,\nor to the lesser Altai; for, in the latitude of Calcutta 46 1/2°\nare equivalent to two thousand five hundred and seventy-five nautical\nmiles. Albo’s log-book gives the difference in longitude between the\nmost eastern islands of the Archipelago and Cape Fermoso (Magellan’s\nStraits), as 106° 30’, while in reality it amounts to 159° 85’.",
        "[Moluccan rights sold to Portugal.] The disputes between the Spaniards\nand the Portuguese, occasioned by the uncertainty of the eastern\nboundary–Portugal had already founded a settlement in the Spice\nIslands–were set at rest by an agreement made in 1529, in which\nCharles V. abandoned his pretended rights to the Moluccas in favor\nof Portugal, for the sum of 350,000 ducats. The Philippines, at that\ntime, were of no value.",
        "[Foreign mail facilities.] The distance from Manila to Hongkong is\nsix hundred fifty nautical miles, and the course is almost exactly\nsouth-east. The mail steamer running between the two ports makes the\ntrip in from three to four days. This allows of a fortnightly postal\ncommunication between the colony and the rest of the world. [9]",
        "[Slight share in world commerce.] This small steamer is the only thing\nto remind an observer at Hongkong, a port thronged with the ships of\nall nations, that an island so specially favored in conditions and\nfertility lies in such close proximity.",
        "[Little commerce with Spain.] Although the Philippines belong to Spain,\nthere is but little commerce between the two countries. Once the\ntie which bound them was so close that Manila was wont to celebrate\nthe arrival of the Spanish mail with Te Deums and bell-ringing, in\nhonor of the successful achievement of so stupendous a journey. Until\nPortugal fell to Spain, the road round Africa to the Philippines was\nnot open to Spanish vessels. The condition of the overland route\nis sufficiently shown by the fact that two Augustinian monks who,\nin 1603, were entrusted with an important message for the king,\nand who chose the direct line through Goa, Turkey, and Italy, needed\nthree years for reaching Madrid. [10]",
        "[Former Spanish ships mainly carried foreign goods.] The trade by\nSpanish ships, which the merchants were compelled to patronize in\norder to avoid paying an additional customs tax, in spite of the\nprotective duties for Spanish products, was almost exclusively\nin foreign goods to the colony and returning the products of the\nlatter for foreign ports. The traffic with Spain was limited to the\nconveyance of officials, priests, and their usual necessaries, such as\nprovisions, wine and other liquors; and, except a few French novels,\nsome atrociously dull books, histories of saints, and similar works.",
        "[Manila’s fine bay.] The Bay of Manila is large enough to contain the\nunited fleets of Europe; it has the reputation of being one of the\nfinest in the world. The aspect of the coast, however, to a stranger\narriving, as did the author, at the close of the dry season, falls\nshort of the lively descriptions of some travellers. The circular bay,\none hundred twenty nautical miles in circumference, the waters of\nwhich wash the shores of five different provinces, is fringed in the\nneighborhood of Manila by a level coast, behind which rises an equally\nflat table land. The scanty vegetation in the foreground, consisting\nchiefly of bamboos and areca palms, was dried up by the sun; while in\nthe far distance the dull uniformity of the landscape was broken by\nthe blue hills of San Mateo. In the rainy season the numerous unwalled\ncanals overflow their banks and form a series of connected lakes,\nwhich soon, however, change into luxuriant and verdant ricefields.",
        "[City’s appearance mediaeval European.] Manila is situated on both\nsides of the river Pasig. The town itself, surrounded with walls and\nramparts, with its low tiled roofs and a few towers, had, in 1859,\nthe appearance of some ancient European fortress. Four years later\nthe greater part of it was destroyed by an earthquake.",
        "[The 1863 earthquake.] On June 3, 1863, at thirty-one minutes past\nseven in the evening, after a day of tremendous heat while all Manila\nwas busy in its preparations for the festival of Corpus Christi,\nthe ground suddenly rocked to and fro with great violence. The\nfirmest buildings reeled visibly, walls crumbled, and beams snapped\nin two. The dreadful shock lasted half a minute; but this little\ninterval was enough to change the whole town into a mass of ruins,\nand to bury alive hundreds of its inhabitants. [11] A letter of\nthe governor-general, which I have seen, states that the cathedral,\nthe government-house, the barracks, and all the public buildings of\nManila were entirely destroyed, and that the few private houses which\nremained standing threatened to fall in. Later accounts speak of\nfour hundred killed and two thousand injured, and estimate the loss\nat eight millions of dollars. Forty-six public and five hundred and\nseventy private buildings were thrown down; twenty-eight public and\nfive hundred twenty-eight private buildings were nearly destroyed,\nand all the houses left standing were more or less injured.",
        "[Damage in Cavite.] At the same time, an earthquake of forty seconds’\nduration occurred at Cavite, the naval port of the Philippines,\nand destroyed many buildings.",
        "[Destruction in walled city.] Three years afterwards, the Duc\nd’Alencon (Lucon et Mindanao; Paris, 1870, S. 38) found the traces\nof the catastrophe everywhere. Three sides of the principal square\nof the city, in which formerly stood the government, or governor’s,\npalace, the cathedral, and the townhouse, were lying like dust heaps\novergrown with weeds. All the large public edifices were “temporarily\"\nconstructed of wood; but nobody then seemed to plan anything permanent.",
        "[Former heavy shocks.] Manila is very often subject to earthquakes;\nthe most fatal occurred in 1601; in 1610 (Nov. 30); in 1645 (Nov. 30);\nin 1658 (Aug. 20); in 1675; in 1699; in 1796; in 1824; in 1852; and\nin 1863. In 1645, six hundred [12], or, according to some accounts,\nthree thousand [13] persons perished, buried under the ruins of their\nhouses. Their monastery, the church of the Augustinians, and that of\nthe Jesuits, were the only public buildings which remained standing.",
        "[Frequent minor disturbances.] Smaller shocks, which suddenly set\nthe hanging lamps swinging, occur very often and generally remain\nunnoticed. The houses are on this account generally of but one story,\nand the loose volcanic soil on which they are built may lessen the\nviolence of the shock. Their heavy tiled roofs, however, appear\nvery inappropriate under such circumstances. Earthquakes are also\nof frequent occurrence in the provinces, but they, as a rule, cause\nso little damage, owing to the houses being constructed of timber or\nbamboo, that they are never mentioned.",
        "[Scanty data available.] M. Alexis Perrey (Mém. de l’Académie de\nDijon, 1860) has published a list, collected with much diligence from\nevery accessible source, of the earthquakes which have visited the\nPhilippines, and particularly Manila. But the accounts, even of the\nmost important, are very scanty, and the dates of their occurrence very\nunreliable. Of the minor shocks, only a few are mentioned, those which\nwere noticed by scientific observers accidentally present at the time.",
        "[The 1610 catastrophe.] Aduarte (I. 141) mentions a tremendous\nearthquake which occurred in 1610. I briefly quote his version of\nthe details of the catastrophe, as I find them mentioned nowhere else.",
        "“Towards the close of November, 1610, on St. Andrew’s Day, a more\nviolent earthquake than had ever before been witnessed, visited\nthese Islands; its effects extended from Manila to the extreme end\nof the province of Nueva Segovia (the whole northern part of Luzon),\na distance of 200 leagues. It caused great destruction over the entire\narea; in the province of Ilocos it buried palm trees, so that only the\ntops of their branches were left above the earth’s surface; through\nthe power of the earthquake mountains were pushed against each other;\nit threw down many buildings, and killed a great number of people. Its\nfury was greatest in Nueva Segovia, where it opened the mountains, and\ncreated new lake basins. The earth threw up immense fountains of sand,\nand vibrated so terribly that the people, unable to stand upon it,\nlaid down and fastened themselves to the ground, as if they had been\non a ship in a stormy sea. In the range inhabited by the Mendayas a\nmountain fell in, crushing a village and killing its inhabitants. An\nimmense portion of the cliff sank into the river; and now, where the\nstream was formerly bordered by a range of hills of considerable\naltitude, its banks are nearly level with the watercourse. The\ncommotion was so great in the bed of the river that waves arose like\nthose of the ocean, or as if the water had been lashed by a furious\nwind. Those edifices which were of stone suffered the most damage,\nour church and the convent fell in, etc., etc.”",
