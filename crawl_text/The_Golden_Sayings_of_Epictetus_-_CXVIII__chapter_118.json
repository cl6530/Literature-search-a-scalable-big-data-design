        "Such a man needs also to have a certain habit of body. If he\nappear consumptive, thin and pale, his testimony has no longer\nthe same authority. He must not only prove to the unlearned by\nshowing them what his Soul is that it is possible to be a good\nman apart from all that they admire; but he must also show them,\nby his body, that a plain and simple manner of life under the\nopen sky does no harm to the body either. “See, I am a proof of\nthis! and my body also.” As Diogenes used to do, who went about\nfresh of look and by the very appearance of his body drew men’s\neyes. But if a Cynic is an object of pity, he seems a mere\nbeggar; all turn away, all are offended at him. Nor should he be\nslovenly of look, so as not to scare men from him in this way\neither; on the contrary, his very roughness should be clean and\nattractive.",
