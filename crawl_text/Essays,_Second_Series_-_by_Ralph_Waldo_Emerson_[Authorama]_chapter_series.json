        "Those who are esteemed umpires of taste are often\npersons who have acquired some knowledge of admired\npictures or sculptures, and have an inclination for\nwhatever is elegant; but if you inquire whether they\nare beautiful souls, and whether their own acts are\nlike fair pictures, you learn that they are selfish\nand sensual. Their cultivation is local, as if you\nshould rub a log of dry wood in one spot to produce\nfire, all the rest remaining cold. Their knowledge\nof the fine arts is some study of rules and particulars,\nor some limited judgment of color or form, which is\nexercised for amusement or for show. It is a proof of\nthe shallowness of the doctrine of beauty as it lies\nin the minds of our amateurs, that men seem to have\nlost the perception of the instant dependence of form\nupon soul. There is no doctrine of forms in our philosophy.\nWe were put into our bodies, as fire is put into a pan to\nbe carried about; but there is no accurate adjustment\nbetween the spirit and the organ, much less is the latter\nthe germination of the former. So in regard to other forms,\nthe intellectual men do not believe in any essential\ndependence of the material world on thought and volition.\nTheologians think it a pretty air-castle to talk of the\nSpiritual meaning of a ship or a cloud, of a city or a\ncontract, but they prefer to come again to the solid\nground of historical evidence; and even the poets are\ncontented with a civil and conformed manner of living,\nand to write poems from the fancy, at a safe distance\nfrom their own experience. But the highest minds of the\nworld have never ceased to explore the double meaning,\nor shall I say the quadruple or the centuple or much more\nmanifold meaning, of every sensuous fact; Orpheus,\nEmpedocles, Heraclitus, Plato, Plutarch, Dante, Swedenborg,\nand the masters of sculpture, picture, and poetry. For we\nare not pans and barrows, nor even porters of the fire\nand torch-bearers, but children of the fire, made of it,\nand only the same divinity transmuted and at two or three\nremoves, when we know least about it. And this hidden\ntruth, that the fountains whence all this river of Time\nand its creatures floweth are intrinsically ideal and\nbeautiful, draws us to the consideration of the nature\nand functions of the Poet, or the man of Beauty; to the\nmeans and materials he uses, and to the general aspect\nof the art in the present time.",
        "The breadth of the problem is great, for the poet\nis representative. He stands among partial men for\nthe complete man, and apprises us not of his wealth,\nbut of the common wealth. The young man reveres men\nof genius, because, to speak truly, they are more\nhimself than he is. They receive of the soul as he\nalso receives, but they more. Nature enhances her\nbeauty, to the eye of loving men, from their belief\nthat the poet is beholding her shows at the same time.\nHe is isolated among his contemporaries by truth and\nby his art, but with this consolation in his pursuits,\nthat they will draw all men sooner or later. For all\nmen live by truth and stand in need of expression. In\nlove, in art, in avarice, in politics, in labor, in\ngames, we study to utter our painful secret. The man\nis only half himself, the other half is his expression.",
        "Notwithstanding this necessity to be published,\nadequate expression is rare. I know not how it is\nthat we need an interpreter, but the great majority\nof men seem to be minors, who have not yet come into\npossession of their own, or mutes, who cannot report\nthe conversation they have had with nature. There is\nno man who does not anticipate a supersensual utility\nin the sun and stars, earth and water. These stand\nand wait to render him a peculiar service. But there\nis some obstruction or some excess of phlegm in our\nconstitution, which does not suffer them to yield the\ndue effect. Too feeble fall the impressions of nature\non us to make us artists. Every touch should thrill.\nEvery man should be so much an artist that he could\nreport in conversation what had befallen him. Yet, in\nour experience, the rays or appulses have sufficient\nforce to arrive at the senses, but not enough to reach\nthe quick and compel the reproduction of themselves in\nspeech. The poet is the person in whom these powers are\nin balance, the man without impediment, who sees and\nhandles that which others dream of, traverses the whole\nscale of experience, and is representative of man, in\nvirtue of being the largest power to receive and to\nimpart.",
        "For the Universe has three children, born at one\ntime, which reappear under different names in every\nsystem of thought, whether they be called cause,\noperation, and effect; or, more poetically, Jove,\nPluto, Neptune; or, theologically, the Father, the\nSpirit, and the Son; but which we will call here\nthe Knower, the Doer, and the Sayer. These stand\nrespectively for the love of truth, for the love\nof good, and for the love of beauty. These three\nare equal. Each is that which he is essentially,\nso that he cannot be surmounted or analyzed, and\neach of these three has the power of the others\nlatent in him, and his own, patent.",
        "The poet is the sayer, the namer, and represents\nbeauty. He is a sovereign, and stands on the centre.\nFor the world is not painted or adorned, but is from\nthe beginning beautiful; and God has not made some\nbeautiful things, but Beauty is the creator of the\nuniverse. Therefore the poet is not any permissive\npotentate, but is emperor in his own right. Criticism\nis infested with a cant of materialism, which assumes\nthat manual skill and activity is the first merit of\nall men, and disparages such as say and do not,\noverlooking the fact that some men, namely poets, are\nnatural sayers, sent into the world to the end of\nexpression, and confounds them with those whose province\nis action but who quit it to imitate the sayers. But\nHomer’s words are as costly and admirable to Homer as\nAgamemnon’s victories are to Agamemnon. The poet does\nnot wait for the hero or the sage, but, as they act and\nthink primarily, so he writes primarily what will and\nmust be spoken, reckoning the others, though primaries\nalso, yet, in respect to him, secondaries and servants;\nas sitters or models in the studio of a painter, or as\nassistants who bring building materials to an architect.",
        "For poetry was all written before time was, and\nwhenever we are so finely organized that we can\npenetrate into that region where the air is music,\nwe hear those primal warblings and attempt to write\nthem down, but we lose ever and anon a word or a\nverse and substitute something of our own, and thus\nmiswrite the poem. The men of more delicate ear\nwrite down these cadences more faithfully, and\nthese transcripts, though imperfect, become the songs\nof the nations. For nature is as truly beautiful as\nit is good, or as it is reasonable, and must as much\nappear as it must be done, or be known. Words and\ndeeds are quite indifferent modes of the divine energy.\nWords are also actions, and actions are a kind of words.",
        "The sign and credentials of the poet are that he\nannounces that which no man foretold. He is the\ntrue and only doctor; he knows and tells; he is\nthe only teller of news, for he was present and\nprivy to the appearance which he describes. He is\na beholder of ideas and an utterer of the necessary\nand causal. For we do not speak now of men of\npoetical talents, or of industry and skill in metre,\nbut of the true poet. I took part in a conversation\nthe other day concerning a recent writer of lyrics,\na man of subtle mind, whose head appeared to be a\nmusic-box of delicate tunes and rhythms, and whose\nskill and command of language, we could not sufficiently\npraise. But when the question arose whether he was not\nonly a lyrist but a poet, we were obliged to confess\nthat he is plainly a contemporary, not an eternal man.\nHe does not stand out of our low limitations, like a\nChimborazo under the line, running up from the torrid\nBase through all the climates of the globe, with belts\nof the herbage of every latitude on its high and mottled\nsides; but this genius is the landscape-garden of a\nmodern house, adorned with fountains and statues, with\nwell-bred men and women standing and sitting in the\nwalks and terraces. We hear, through all the varied\nmusic, the ground-tone of conventional life. Our poets\nare men of talents who sing, and not the children of\nmusic. The argument is secondary, the finish of the\nverses is primary.",
        "For it is not metres, but a metre-making argument\nthat makes a poem,—a thought so passionate and\nalive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal\nit has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature\nwith a new thing. The thought and the form are equal\nin the order of time, but in the order of genesis\nthe thought is prior to the form. The poet has a new\nthought; he has a whole new experience to unfold; he\nwill tell us how it was with him, and all men will be\nthe richer in his fortune. For the experience of each\nnew age requires a new confession, and the world seems\nalways waiting for its poet. I remember when I was\nyoung how much I was moved one morning by tidings that\ngenius had appeared in a youth who sat near me at\ntable. He had left his work and gone rambling none\nknew whither, and had written hundreds of lines, but\ncould not tell whether that which was in him was\ntherein told; he could tell nothing but that all was\nchanged,—man, beast, heaven, earth and sea. How gladly\nwe listened! how credulous! Society seemed to be\ncompromised. We sat in the aurora of a sunrise which\nwas to put out all the stars.  Boston seemed to be at\ntwice the distance it had the night before, or was\nmuch farther than that. Rome,—what was Rome? Plutarch\nand Shakspeare were in the yellow leaf, and Homer no\nmore should be heard of. It is much to know that poetry\nhas been written this very day, under this very roof,\nby your side. What! that wonderful spirit has not\nexpired! These stony moments are still sparkling and\nanimated! I had fancied that the oracles were all silent,\nand nature had spent her fires; and behold! all night,\nfrom every pore, these fine auroras have been streaming.\nEvery one has some interest in the advent of the poet,\nand no one knows how much it may concern him. We know\nthat the secret of the world is profound, but who or\nwhat shall be our interpreter, we know not. A mountain\nramble, a new style of face, a new person, may put the\nkey into our hands. Of course the value of genius to us\nis in the veracity of its report. Talent may frolic and\njuggle; genius realizes and adds. Mankind in good\nearnest have availed so far in understanding themselves\nand their work, that the foremost watchman on the peak\nannounces his news. It is the truest word ever spoken,\nand the phrase will be the fittest, most musical, and\nthe unerring voice of the world for that time.",
        "All that we call sacred history attests that the\nbirth of a poet is the principal event in chronology.\nMan, never so often deceived, still watches for the\narrival of a brother who can hold him steady to a\ntruth until he has made it his own. With what joy I\nbegin to read a poem which I confide in as an\ninspiration! And now my chains are to be broken; I\nshall mount above these clouds and opaque airs in\nwhich I live,—opaque, though they seem transparent,\n—and from the heaven of truth I shall see and\ncomprehend my relations. That will reconcile me to\nlife and renovate nature, to see trifles animated\nby a tendency, and to know what I am doing. Life will\nno more be a noise; now I shall see men and women,\nand know the signs by which they may be discerned\nfrom fools and satans. This day shall be better than\nmy birthday:  then I became an animal; now I am\ninvited into the science of the real. Such is the\nhope, but the fruition is postponed. Oftener it falls\nthat this winged man, who will carry me into the heaven,\nwhirls me into mists, then leaps and frisks about with\nme as it were from cloud to cloud, still affirming that\nhe is bound heavenward; and I, being myself a novice,\nam slow in perceiving that he does not know the way\ninto the heavens, and is merely bent that I should admire\nhis skill to rise like a fowl or a flying fish, a little\nway from the ground or the water; but the all-piercing,\nall-feeding, and ocular air of heaven that man shall\nnever inhabit. I tumble down again soon into my old nooks,\nand lead the life of exaggerations as before, and have\nlost my faith in the possibility of any guide who can\nlead me thither where I would be.",
        "But, leaving these victims of vanity, let us, with\nnew hope, observe how nature, by worthier impulses,\nhas ensured the poet’s fidelity to his office of\nannouncement and affirming, namely by the beauty of\nthings, which becomes a new and higher beauty when\nexpressed. Nature offers all her creatures to him as\na picture-language. Being used as a type, a second\nwonderful value appears in the object, far better\nthan its old value; as the carpenter’s stretched\ncord, if you hold your ear close enough, is musical\nin the breeze.  “Things more excellent than every\nimage,” says Jamblichus, “are expressed through\nimages.” Things admit of being used as symbols\nbecause nature is a symbol, in the whole, and in\nevery part. Every line we can draw in the sand has\nexpression; and there is no body without its spirit\nor genius. All form is an effect of character; all\ncondition, of the quality of the life; all harmony,\nof health; and for this reason a perception of beauty\nshould be sympathetic, or proper only to the good.\nThe beautiful rests on the foundations of the necessary.\nThe soul makes the body, as the wise Spenser teaches:—",
        "Here we find ourselves suddenly not in a critical\nspeculation but in a holy place, and should go very\nwarily and reverently. We stand before the secret\nof the world, there where Being passes into Appearance\nand Unity into Variety.",
        "The Universe is the externization of the soul.\nWherever the life is, that bursts into appearance\naround it.  Our science is sensual, and therefore\nsuperficial. The earth and the heavenly bodies,\nphysics, and chemistry, we sensually treat, as if\nthey were self-existent; but these are the retinue\nof that Being we have. “The mighty heaven,” said\nProclus, “exhibits, in its transfigurations, clear\nimages of the splendor of intellectual perceptions;\nbeing moved in conjunction with the unapparent periods\nof intellectual natures.”  Therefore science always\ngoes abreast with the just elevation of the man,\nkeeping step with religion and metaphysics; or the\nstate of science is an index of our self-knowledge.\nSince everything in nature answers to a moral power,\nif any phenomenon remains brute and dark it is that\nthe corresponding faculty in the observer is not yet\nactive.",
        "No wonder then, if these waters be so deep, that we\nhover over them with a religious regard. The beauty\nof the fable proves the importance of the sense; to\nthe poet, and to all others; or, if you please, every\nman is so far a poet as to be susceptible of these\nenchantments of nature; for all men have the thoughts\nwhereof the universe is the celebration. I find that\nthe fascination resides in the symbol. Who loves\nnature? Who does not? Is it only poets, and men of\nleisure and cultivation, who live with her? No; but\nalso hunters, farmers, grooms, and butchers, though\nthey express their affection in their choice of life\nand not in their choice of words. The writer wonders\nwhat the coachman or the hunter values in riding, in\nhorses and dogs. It is not superficial qualities. When\nyou talk with him he holds these at as slight a rate as\nyou. His worship is sympathetic; he has no definitions,\nbut he is commanded in nature, by the living power\nwhich he feels to be there present. No imitation or\nplaying of these things would content him; he loves\nthe earnest of the north wind, of rain, of stone, and\nwood, and iron. A beauty not explicable is dearer than\na beauty which we can see to the end of. It is nature\nthe symbol, nature certifying the supernatural, body\noverflowed by life which he worships with coarse but\nsincere rites.",
        "The inwardness and mystery of this attachment\ndrives men of every class to the use of emblems.\nThe schools of poets and philosophers are not more\nintoxicated with their symbols than the populace\nwith theirs. In our political parties, compute the\npower of badges and emblems. See the great ball\nwhich they roll from Baltimore to Bunker hill! In\nthe political processions, Lowell goes in a loom,\nand Lynn in a shoe, and Salem in a ship. Witness\nthe cider-barrel, the log-cabin, the hickory-stick,\nthe palmetto, and all the cognizances of party. See\nthe power of national emblems. Some stars, lilies,\nleopards, a crescent, a lion, an eagle, or other\nfigure which came into credit God knows how, on an\nold rag of bunting, blowing in the wind on a fort\nat the ends of the earth, shall make the blood tingle\nunder the rudest or the most conventional exterior.\nThe people fancy they hate poetry, and they are all\npoets and mystics!",
        "Beyond this universality of the symbolic language,\nwe are apprised of the divineness of this superior\nuse of things, whereby the world is a temple whose\nwalls are covered with emblems, pictures, and\ncommandments of the Deity,—in this, that there is\nno fact in nature which does not carry the whole\nsense of nature; and the distinctions which we make\nin events and in affairs, of low and high, honest\nand base, disappear when nature is used as a symbol.\nThought makes everything fit for use. The vocabulary\nof an omniscient man would embrace words and images\nexcluded from polite conversation. What would be\nbase, or even obscene, to the obscene, becomes\nillustrious, spoken in a new connexion of thought.\nThe piety of the Hebrew prophets purges their grossness.\nThe circumcision is an example of the power of poetry\nto raise the low and offensive. Small and mean things\nserve as well as great symbols. The meaner the type by\nwhich a law is expressed, the more pungent it is, and\nthe more lasting in the memories of men: just as we\nchoose the smallest box or case in which any needful\nutensil can be carried. Bare lists of words are found\nsuggestive to an imaginative and excited mind; as it\nis related of Lord Chatham that he was accustomed to\nread in Bailey’s Dictionary when he was preparing to\nspeak in Parliament. The poorest experience is rich\nenough for all the purposes of expressing thought. Why\ncovet a knowledge of new facts? Day and night, house\nand garden, a few books, a few actions, serve us as\nwell as would all trades and all spectacles. We are\nfar from having exhausted the significance of the few\nsymbols we use.  We can come to use them yet with a\nterrible simplicity. It does not need that a poem\nshould be long.  Every word was once a poem. Every\nnew relation is a new word. Also we use defects and\ndeformities to a sacred purpose, so expressing our\nsense that the evils of the world are such only to\nthe evil eye. In the old mythology, mythologists\nobserve, defects are ascribed to divine natures, as\nlameness to Vulcan, blindness to Cupid, and the like,\n—to signify exuberances.",
        "For as it is dislocation and detachment from the\nlife of God that makes things ugly, the poet, who\nre-attaches things to nature and the Whole,—\nre-attaching even artificial things and violations\nof nature, to nature, by a deeper insight,—disposes\nvery easily of the most disagreeable facts. Readers\nof poetry see the factory-village and the railway,\nand fancy that the poetry of the landscape is broken\nup by these; for these works of art are not yet\nconsecrated in their reading; but the poet sees them\nfall within the great Order not less than the beehive\nor the spider’s geometrical web. Nature adopts them\nvery fast into her vital circles, and the gliding\ntrain of cars she loves like her own. Besides, in a\ncentred mind, it signifies nothing how many mechanical\ninventions you exhibit. Though you add millions, and\nnever so surprising, the fact of mechanics has not\ngained a grain’s weight. The spiritual fact remains\nunalterable, by many or by few particulars; as no\nmountain is of any appreciable height to break the\ncurve of the sphere. A shrewd country-boy goes to the\ncity for the first time, and the complacent citizen\nis not satisfied with his little wonder. It is not\nthat he does not see all the fine houses and know that\nhe never saw such before, but he disposes of them as\neasily as the poet finds place for the railway. The\nchief value of the new fact is to enhance the great\nand constant fact of Life, which can dwarf any and\nevery circumstance, and to which the belt of wampum\nand the commerce of America are alike.",
        "The world being thus put under the mind for verb\nand noun, the poet is he who can articulate it.\nFor though life is great, and fascinates, and absorbs;\nand though all men are intelligent of the symbols\nthrough which it is named; yet they cannot originally\nuse them. We are symbols and inhabit symbols; workmen,\nwork, and tools, words and things, birth and death,\nall are emblems; but we sympathize with the symbols,\nand being infatuated with the economical uses of\nthings, we do not know that they are thoughts. The\npoet, by an ulterior intellectual perception, gives\nthem a power which makes their old use forgotten, and\nputs eyes and a tongue into every dumb and inanimate\nobject. He perceives the independence of the thought\non the symbol, the stability of the thought, the\naccidency and fugacity of the symbol. As the eyes of\nLyncaeus were said to see through the earth, so the\npoet turns the world to glass, and shows us all\nthings in their right series and procession. For\nthrough that better perception he stands one step\nnearer to things, and sees the flowing or metamorphosis;\nperceives that thought is multiform; that within the\nform of every creature is a force impelling it to ascend\ninto a higher form; and following with his eyes the life,\nuses the forms which express that life, and so his speech\nflows with the flowing of nature. All the facts of the\nanimal economy, sex, nutriment, gestation, birth, growth,\nare symbols of the passage of the world into the soul of\nman, to suffer there a change and reappear a new and\nhigher fact.  He uses forms according to the life, and\nnot according to the form. This is true science. The\npoet alone knows astronomy, chemistry, vegetation and\nanimation, for he does not stop at these facts, but\nemploys them as signs. He knows why the plain or meadow\nof space was strewn with these flowers we call suns and\nmoons and stars; why the great deep is adorned with\nanimals, with men, and gods; for in every word he speaks\nhe rides on them as the horses of thought.",
        "By virtue of this science the poet is the Namer\nor Language-maker, naming things sometimes after\ntheir appearance, sometimes after their essence,\nand giving to every one its own name and not\nanother’s, thereby rejoicing the intellect, which\ndelights in detachment or boundary. The poets made\nall the words, and therefore language is the\narchives of history, and, if we must say it, a\nsort of tomb of the muses.  For though the origin\nof most of our words is forgotten, each word was\nat first a stroke of genius, and obtained currency\nbecause for the moment it symbolized the world to\nthe first speaker and to the hearer.  The etymologist\nfinds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant\npicture. Language is fossil poetry.  As the limestone\nof the continent consists of infinite masses of the\nshells of animalcules, so language is made up of\nimages or tropes, which now, in their secondary use,\nhave long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin.\nBut the poet names the thing because he sees it, or\ncomes one step nearer to it than any other. This\nexpression or naming is not art, but a second nature,\ngrown out of the first, as a leaf out of a tree. What\nwe call nature is a certain self-regulated motion or\nchange; and nature does all things by her own hands,\nand does not leave another to baptize her but baptizes\nherself; and this through the metamorphosis again. I\nremember that a certain poet described it to me thus:",
        "Genius is the activity which repairs the decays\nof things, whether wholly or partly of a material\nand finite kind. Nature, through all her kingdoms,\ninsures herself. Nobody cares for planting the\npoor fungus; so she shakes down from the gills of\none agaric countless spores, any one of which,\nbeing preserved, transmits new billions of spores\nto-morrow or next day. The new agaric of this hour\nhas a chance which the old one had not. This atom\nof seed is thrown into a new place, not subject to\nthe accidents which destroyed its parent two rods\noff. She makes a man; and having brought him to\nripe age, she will no longer run the risk of losing\nthis wonder at a blow, but she detaches from him a\nnew self, that the kind may be safe from accidents\nto which the individual is exposed. So when the\nsoul of the poet has come to ripeness of thought,\nshe detaches and sends away from it its poems or\nsongs,—a fearless, sleepless, deathless progeny,\nwhich is not exposed to the accidents of the weary\nkingdom of time; a fearless, vivacious offspring,\nclad with wings (such was the virtue of the soul out\nof which they came) which carry them fast and far,\nand infix them irrecoverably into the hearts of men.\nThese wings are the beauty of the poet’s soul. The\nsongs, thus flying immortal from their mortal parent,\nare pursued by clamorous flights of censures, which\nswarm in far greater numbers and threaten to devour\nthem; but these last are not winged. At the end of a\nvery short leap they fall plump down and rot, having\nreceived from the souls out of which they came no\nbeautiful wings. But the melodies of the poet ascend\nand leap and pierce into the deeps of infinite time.",
        "So far the bard taught me, using his freer speech.\nBut nature has a higher end, in the production of\nNew individuals, than security, namely ascension,\nor the passage of the soul into higher forms. I knew\nin my younger days the sculptor who made the statue\nof the youth which stands in the public garden. He\nwas, as I remember, unable to tell directly, what\nmade him happy or unhappy, but by wonderful\nindirections he could tell. He rose one day, according\nto his habit, before the dawn, and saw the morning\nbreak, grand as the eternity out of which it came,\nand for many days after, he strove to express this\ntranquillity, and lo! his chisel had fashioned out\nof marble the form of a beautiful youth, Phosphorus,\nwhose aspect is such that it is said all persons who\nlook on it become silent. The poet also resigns\nhimself to his mood, and that thought which agitated\nhim is expressed, but alter idem, in a manner totally\nnew. The expression is organic, or the new type which\nthings themselves take when liberated. As, in the sun,\nobjects paint their images on the retina of the eye,\nso they, sharing the aspiration of the whole universe,\ntend to paint a far more delicate copy of their essence\nin his mind. Like the metamorphosis of things into\nhigher organic forms is their change into melodies.\nOver everything stands its daemon or soul, and, as\nthe form of the thing is reflected by the eye, so the\nsoul of the thing is reflected by a melody. The sea,\nthe mountain-ridge, Niagara, and every flower-bed,\npre-exist, or super-exist, in pre-cantations, which\nsail like odors in the air, and when any man goes by\nwith an ear sufficiently fine, he overhears them and\nendeavors to write down the notes without diluting or\ndepraving them. And herein is the legitimation of\ncriticism, in the mind’s faith that the poems are a\ncorrupt version of some text in nature with which they\nought to be made to tally. A rhyme in one of our sonnets\nshould not be less pleasing than the iterated nodes of\na sea-shell, or the resembling difference of a group\nof flowers. The pairing of the birds is an idyl, not\ntedious as our idyls are; a tempest is a rough ode,\nwithout falsehood or rant; a summer, with its harvest\nsown, reaped, and stored, is an epic song, subordinating\nhow many admirably executed parts.  Why should not the\nsymmetry and truth that modulate these, glide into our\nspirits, and we participate the invention of nature?",
        "This insight, which expresses itself by what is\ncalled Imagination, is a very high sort of seeing,\nwhich does not come by study, but by the intellect\nbeing where and what it sees; by sharing the path\nor circuit of things through forms, and so making\nthem translucid to others. The path of things is\nsilent. Will they suffer a speaker to go with them?\nA spy they will not suffer; a lover, a poet, is the\ntranscendency of their own nature,—him they will\nsuffer. The condition of true naming, on the poet’s\npart, is his resigning himself to the divine aura\nwhich breathes through forms, and accompanying that.",
        "It is a secret which every intellectual man quickly\nlearns, that, beyond the energy of his possessed and\nconscious intellect he is capable of a new energy\n(as of an intellect doubled on itself), by abandonment\nto the nature of things; that beside his privacy of\npower as an individual man, there is a great public\npower on which he can draw, by unlocking, at all risks,\nhis human doors, and suffering the ethereal tides to\nroll and circulate through him; then he is caught up\ninto the life of the Universe, his speech is thunder,\nhis thought is law, and his words are universally\nintelligible as the plants and animals. The poet knows\nthat he speaks adequately then only when he speaks\nsomewhat wildly, or, “with the flower of the mind;\"\nnot with the intellect used as an organ, but with the\nintellect released from all service and suffered to\ntake its direction from its celestial life; or as the\nancients were wont to express themselves, not with\nintellect alone but with the intellect inebriated by\nnectar. As the traveller who has lost his way throws\nhis reins on his horse’s neck and trusts to the\ninstinct of the animal to find his road, so must we\ndo with the divine animal who carries us through this\nworld. For if in any manner we can stimulate this\ninstinct, new passages are opened for us into nature;\nthe mind flows into and through things hardest and\nhighest, and the metamorphosis is possible.",
        "This is the reason why bards love wine, mead,\nnarcotics, coffee, tea, opium, the fumes of sandal\n-wood and tobacco, or whatever other procurers of\nanimal exhilaration. All men avail themselves of\nsuch means as they can, to add this extraordinary\npower to their normal powers; and to this end they\nprize conversation, music, pictures, sculpture,\ndancing, theatres, travelling, war, mobs, fires,\ngaming, politics, or love, or science, or animal\nintoxication,—which are several coarser or finer\nquasi-mechanical substitutes for the true nectar,\nwhich is the ravishment of the intellect by coming\nnearer to the fact. These are auxiliaries to the\ncentrifugal tendency of a man, to his passage out\ninto free space, and they help him to escape the\ncustody of that body in which he is pent up, and\nof that jail-yard of individual relations in which\nhe is enclosed. Hence a great number of such as were\nprofessionally expressers of Beauty, as painters,\npoets, musicians, and actors, have been more than\nothers wont to lead a life of pleasure and indulgence;\nall but the few who received the true nectar; and, as\nit was a spurious mode of attaining freedom, as it was\nan emancipation not into the heavens but into the\nfreedom of baser places, they were punished for that\nadvantage they won, by a dissipation and deterioration.\nBut never can any advantage be taken of nature by a\ntrick. The spirit of the world, the great calm presence\nof the Creator, comes not forth to the sorceries of\nopium or of wine. The sublime vision comes to the pure\nand simple soul in a clean and chaste body. That is not\nan inspiration, which we owe to narcotics, but some\ncounterfeit excitement and fury. Milton says that the\nlyric poet may drink wine and live generously, but the\nepic poet, he who shall sing of the gods and their\ndescent unto men, must drink water out of a wooden\nbowl. For poetry is not ’Devil’s wine,’ but God’s wine.\nIt is with this as it is with toys. We fill the hands\nand nurseries of our children with all manner of dolls,\ndrums, and horses; withdrawing their eyes from the\nplain face and sufficing objects of nature, the sun,\nand moon, the animals, the water, and stones, which\nshould be their toys. So the poet’s habit of living\nshould be set on a key so low that the common\ninfluences should delight him. His cheerfulness should\nbe the gift of the sunlight; the air should suffice\nfor his inspiration, and he should be tipsy with water.\nThat spirit which suffices quiet hearts, which seems to\ncome forth to such from every dry knoll of sere grass,\nfrom every pine-stump and half-imbedded stone on which\nthe dull March sun shines, comes forth to the poor and\nhungry, and such as are of simple taste.  If thou fill\nthy brain with Boston and New York, with fashion and\ncovetousness, and wilt stimulate thy jaded senses with\nwine and French coffee, thou shalt find no radiance of\nwisdom in the lonely waste of the pinewoods.",
        "If the imagination intoxicates the poet, it is\nnot inactive in other men. The metamorphosis\nexcites in the beholder an emotion of joy. The\nuse of symbols has a certain power of emancipation\nand exhilaration for all men. We seem to be touched\nby a wand which makes us dance and run about happily,\nlike children.  We are like persons who come out of\na cave or cellar into the open air. This is the\neffect on us of tropes, fables, oracles, and all\npoetic forms. Poets are thus liberating gods. Men\nhave really got a new sense, and found within their\nworld another world, or nest of worlds; for, the\nmetamorphosis once seen, we divine that it does not\nstop. I will not now consider how much this makes\nthe charm of algebra and the mathematics, which\nalso have their tropes, but it is felt in every\ndefinition; as when Aristotle defines space to be\nan immovable vessel in which things are contained;\n—or when Plato defines a line to be a flowing\npoint; or figure to be a bound of solid; and many\nthe like. What a joyful sense of freedom we have\nwhen Vitruvius announces the old opinion of artists\nthat no architect can build any house well who does\nnot know something of anatomy. When Socrates, in\nCharmides, tells us that the soul is cured of its\nmaladies by certain incantations, and that these\nincantations are beautiful reasons, from which\ntemperance is generated in souls; when Plato calls\nthe world an animal; and Timaeus affirms that the\nplants also are animals; or affirms a man to be a\nheavenly tree, growing with his root, which is his\nhead, upward; and, as George Chapman, following him,\nwrites,—",
        "when Orpheus speaks of hoariness as “that white\nflower which marks extreme old age;” when Proclus\ncalls the universe the statue of the intellect;\nwhen Chaucer, in his praise of ’Gentilesse,’ compares\ngood blood in mean condition to fire, which, though\ncarried to the darkest house betwixt this and the\nmount of Caucasus, will yet hold its natural office\nand burn as bright as if twenty thousand men did it\nbehold; when John saw, in the Apocalypse, the ruin\nof the world through evil, and the stars fall from\nheaven as the figtree casteth her untimely fruit;\nwhen Aesop reports the whole catalogue of common\ndaily relations through the masquerade of birds and\nbeasts;—we take the cheerful hint of the immortality\nof our essence and its versatile habit and escapes,\nas when the gypsies say “it is in vain to hang them,\nthey cannot die.”",
        "The poets are thus liberating gods. The ancient\nBritish bards had for the title of their order, “Those\nWho are free throughout the world.” They are free, and\nthey make free. An imaginative book renders us much\nmore service at first, by stimulating us through its\ntropes, than afterward when we arrive at the precise\nsense of the author. I think nothing is of any value\nin books excepting the transcendental and extraordinary.\nIf a man is inflamed and carried away by his thought,\nto that degree that he forgets the authors and the\npublic and heeds only this one dream which holds him\nlike an insanity, let me read his paper, and you may\nhave all the arguments and histories and criticism.\nAll the value which attaches to Pythagoras, Paracelsus,\nCornelius Agrippa, Cardan, Kepler, Swedenborg, Schelling,\nOken, or any other who introduces questionable facts\ninto his cosmogony, as angels, devils, magic, astrology,\npalmistry, mesmerism, and so on, is the certificate we\nhave of departure from routine, and that here is a new\nwitness. That also is the best success in conversation,\nthe magic of liberty, which puts the world like a ball\nin our hands. How cheap even the liberty then seems;\nhow mean to study, when an emotion communicates to the\nintellect the power to sap and upheave nature; how great\nthe perspective! nations, times, systems, enter and\ndisappear like threads in tapestry of large figure and\nmany colors; dream delivers us to dream, and while the\ndrunkenness lasts we will sell our bed, our philosophy,\nour religion, in our opulence.",
        "There is good reason why we should prize this\nliberation. The fate of the poor shepherd, who,\nblinded and lost in the snow-storm, perishes in a\ndrift within a few feet of his cottage door, is an\nemblem of the state of man. On the brink of the\nwaters of life and truth, we are miserably dying.\nThe inaccessibleness of every thought but that we\nare in, is wonderful. What if you come near to it;\nyou are as remote when you are nearest as when you\nare farthest. Every thought is also a prison; every\nheaven is also a prison. Therefore we love the poet,\nthe inventor, who in any form, whether in an ode or\nin an action or in looks and behavior has yielded\nus a new thought. He unlocks our chains and admits\nus to a new scene.",
        "This emancipation is dear to all men, and the power\nto impart it, as it must come from greater depth and\nscope of thought, is a measure of intellect. Therefore\nall books of the imagination endure, all which ascend\nto that truth that the writer sees nature beneath him,\nand uses it as his exponent. Every verse or sentence\npossessing this virtue will take care of its own\nimmortality. The religions of the world are the\nejaculations of a few imaginative men.",
        "But the quality of the imagination is to flow,\nand not to freeze. The poet did not stop at the\ncolor or the form, but read their meaning; neither\nmay he rest in this meaning, but he makes the same\nobjects exponents of his new thought. Here is the\ndifference betwixt the poet and the mystic, that\nthe last nails a symbol to one sense, which was a\ntrue sense for a moment, but soon becomes old and\nfalse. For all symbols are fluxional; all language\nis vehicular and transitive, and is good, as ferries\nand horses are, for conveyance, not as farms and\nhouses are, for homestead. Mysticism consists in\nthe mistake of an accidental and individual symbol\nfor an universal one. The morning-redness happens\nto be the favorite meteor to the eyes of Jacob Behmen,\nand comes to stand to him for truth and faith; and,\nhe believes, should stand for the same realities to\nevery reader. But the first reader prefers as\nnaturally the symbol of a mother and child, or a\ngardener and his bulb, or a jeweller polishing a\ngem. Either of these, or of a myriad more, are equally\ngood to the person to whom they are significant. Only\nthey must be held lightly, and be very willingly\ntranslated into the equivalent terms which others use.\nAnd the mystic must be steadily told,—All that you\nsay is just as true without the tedious use of that\nsymbol as with it. Let us have a little algebra,\ninstead of this trite rhetoric,—universal signs,\ninstead of these village symbols,—and we shall both\nbe gainers. The history of hierarchies seems to show\nthat all religious error consisted in making the\nsymbol too stark and solid, and was at last nothing\nbut an excess of the organ of language.",
        "Swedenborg, of all men in the recent ages, stands\neminently for the translator of nature into thought.\nI do not know the man in history to whom things\nstood so uniformly for words. Before him the\nmetamorphosis continually plays. Everything on which\nhis eye rests, obeys the impulses of moral nature.\nThe figs become grapes whilst he eats them. When\nsome of his angels affirmed a truth, the laurel twig\nwhich they held blossomed in their hands. The noise\nwhich at a distance appeared like gnashing and\nthumping, on coming nearer was found to be the voice\nof disputants. The men in one of his visions, seen in\nheavenly light, appeared like dragons, and seemed in\ndarkness; but to each other they appeared as men, and\nwhen the light from heaven shone into their cabin,\nthey complained of the darkness, and were compelled\nto shut the window that they might see.",
        "There was this perception in him which makes the poet\nor seer an object of awe and terror, namely that the\nsame man or society of men may wear one aspect to\nthemselves and their companions, and a different aspect\nto higher intelligences. Certain priests, whom he\ndescribes as conversing very learnedly together,\nappeared to the children who were at some distance,\nlike dead horses; and many the like misappearances. And\ninstantly the mind inquires whether these fishes under\nthe bridge, yonder oxen in the pasture, those dogs in\nthe yard, are immutably fishes, oxen, and dogs, or only\nso appear to me, and perchance to themselves appear\nupright men; and whether I appear as a man to all eyes.\nThe Bramins and Pythagoras propounded the same question,\nand if any poet has witnessed the transformation he\ndoubtless found it in harmony with various experiences.\nWe have all seen changes as considerable in wheat and\ncaterpillars. He is the poet and shall draw us with\nlove and terror, who sees through the flowing vest the\nfirm nature, and can declare it.",
        "I look in vain for the poet whom I describe. We do\nnot with sufficient plainness or sufficient\nprofoundness address ourselves to life, nor dare we\nchaunt our own times and social circumstance. If we\nfilled the day with bravery, we should not shrink\nfrom celebrating it. Time and nature yield us many\ngifts, but not yet the timely man, the new religion,\nthe reconciler, whom all things await. Dante’s praise\nis that he dared to write his autobiography in colossal\ncipher, or into universality. We have yet had no genius\nin America, with tyrannous eye, which knew the value of\nour incomparable materials, and saw, in the barbarism\nand materialism of the times, another carnival of the\nsame gods whose picture he so much admires in Homer;\nthen in the Middle Age; then in Calvinism. Banks and\ntariffs, the newspaper and caucus, Methodism and\nUnitarianism, are flat and dull to dull people, but\nrest on the same foundations of wonder as the town of\nTroy and the temple of Delphi, and are as swiftly passing\naway. Our logrolling, our stumps and their politics, our\nfisheries, our Negroes and Indians, our boats and our\nrepudiations, the wrath of rogues and the pusillanimity\nof honest men, the northern trade, the southern planting,\nthe western clearing, Oregon and Texas, are yet unsung.\nYet America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography\ndazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for\nmetres. If I have not found that excellent combination\nof gifts in my countrymen which I seek, neither could\nI aid myself to fix the idea of the poet by reading now\nand then in Chalmers’s collection of five centuries of\nEnglish poets. These are wits more than poets, though\nthere have been poets among them. But when we adhere\nto the ideal of the poet, we have our difficulties even\nwith Milton and Homer. Milton is too literary, and Homer\ntoo literal and historical.",
        "But I am not wise enough for a national criticism,\nand must use the old largeness a little longer, to\ndischarge my errand from the muse to the poet\nconcerning his art.",
        "Art is the path of the creator to his work. The\npaths or methods are ideal and eternal, though few\nmen ever see them; not the artist himself for years,\nor for a lifetime, unless he come into the conditions.\nThe painter, the sculptor, the composer, the epic\nrhapsodist, the orator, all partake one desire, namely\nto express themselves symmetrically and abundantly,\nnot dwarfishly and fragmentarily. They found or put\nthemselves in certain conditions, as, the painter and\nsculptor before some impressive human figures; the\norator, into the assembly of the people; and the others\nin such scenes as each has found exciting to his\nintellect; and each presently feels the new desire.\nHe hears a voice, he sees a beckoning. Then he is\napprised, with wonder, what herds of daemons hem him\nin. He can no more rest; he says, with the old painter,\n\"By God, it is in me and must go forth of me.” He\npursues a beauty, half seen, which flies before him.\nThe poet pours out verses in every solitude. Most of\nthe things he says are conventional, no doubt; but by\nand by he says something which is original and beautiful.\nThat charms him. He would say nothing else but such\nthings. In our way of talking we say ’That is yours,\nthis is mine;’ but the poet knows well that it is not\nhis; that it is as strange and beautiful to him as to\nyou; he would fain hear the like eloquence at length.\nOnce having tasted this immortal ichor, he cannot have\nenough of it, and as an admirable creative power exists\nin these intellections, it is of the last importance\nthat these things get spoken. What a little of all we\nknow is said! What drops of all the sea of our science\nare baled up! and by what accident it is that these are\nexposed, when so many secrets sleep in nature! Hence the\nnecessity of speech and song; hence these throbs and\nheart-beatings in the orator, at the door of the assembly,\nto the end namely that thought may be ejaculated as Logos,\nor Word.",
        "Doubt not, O poet, but persist. Say ’It is in me,\nand shall out.’ Stand there, balked and dumb,\nstuttering and stammering, hissed and hooted, stand\nand strive, until at last rage draw out of thee that\ndream-power which every night shows thee is thine\nown; a power transcending all limit and privacy, and\nby virtue of which a man is the conductor of the\nwhole river of electricity. Nothing walks, or creeps,\nor grows, or exists, which must not in turn arise\nand walk before him as exponent of his meaning. Comes\nhe to that power, his genius is no longer exhaustible.\nAll the creatures by pairs and by tribes pour into\nhis mind as into a Noah’s ark, to come forth again\nto people a new world. This is like the stock of air\nfor our respiration or for the combustion of our\nfireplace; not a measure of gallons, but the entire\natmosphere if wanted. And therefore the rich poets,\nas Homer, Chaucer, Shakspeare, and Raphael, have\nobviously no limits to their works except the limits\nof their lifetime, and resemble a mirror carried\nthrough the street, ready to render an image of every\ncreated thing.",
        "O poet! a new nobility is conferred in groves and\npastures, and not in castles or by the sword-blade\nany longer. The conditions are hard, but equal.\nThou shalt leave the world, and know the muse only.\nThou shalt not know any longer the times, customs,\ngraces, politics, or opinions of men, but shalt take\nall from the muse. For the time of towns is tolled\nfrom the world by funereal chimes, but in nature the\nuniversal hours are counted by succeeding tribes of\nanimals and plants, and by growth of joy on joy. God\nwills also that thou abdicate a manifold and duplex\nlife, and that thou be content that others speak for\nthee.  Others shall be thy gentlemen and shall\nrepresent all courtesy and worldly life for thee;\nothers shall do the great and resounding actions also.\nThou shalt lie close hid with nature, and canst not\nbe afforded to the Capitol or the Exchange. The world\nis full of renunciations and apprenticeships, and this\nis thine: thou must pass for a fool and a churl for a\nlong season. This is the screen and sheath in which\nPan has protected his well-beloved flower, and thou\nshalt be known only to thine own, and they shall\nconsole thee with tenderest love. And thou shalt not\nbe able to rehearse the names of thy friends in thy\nverse, for an old shame before the holy ideal. And\nthis is the reward; that the ideal shall be real to\nthee, and the impressions of the actual world shall\nfall like summer rain, copious, but not troublesome,\nto thy invulnerable essence. Thou shalt have the whole\nland for thy park and manor, the sea for thy bath and\nnavigation, without tax and without envy; the woods\nand the rivers thou shalt own; and thou shalt possess\nthat wherein others are only tenants and boarders.\nThou true land-lord! sea-lord! air-lord!  Wherever\nsnow falls or water flows or birds fly, wherever day\nand night meet in twilight, wherever the blue heaven\nis hung by clouds or sown with stars, wherever are\nforms with transparent boundaries, wherever are outlets\ninto celestial space, wherever is danger, and awe, and\nlove,—there is Beauty, plenteous as rain, shed for thee,\nand though thou shouldest walk the world over, thou shalt\nnot be able to find a condition inopportune or ignoble.",
        "WHERE do we find ourselves? In a series of which\nwe do not know the extremes, and believe that it\nhas none. We wake and find ourselves on a stair;\nthere are stairs below us, which we seem to have\nascended; there are stairs above us, many a one,\nwhich go upward and out of sight. But the Genius\nwhich according to the old belief stands at the\ndoor by which we enter, and gives us the lethe to\ndrink, that we may tell no tales, mixed the cup\ntoo strongly, and we cannot shake off the lethargy\nnow at noonday.  Sleep lingers all our lifetime\nabout our eyes, as night hovers all day in the\nboughs of the fir-tree. All things swim and glitter.\nOur life is not so much threatened as our perception.\nGhostlike we glide through nature, and should not\nknow our place again. Did our birth fall in some\nfit of indigence and frugality in nature, that she\nwas so sparing of her fire and so liberal of her\nearth that it appears to us that we lack the\naffirmative principle, and though we have health\nand reason, yet we have no superfluity of spirit\nfor new creation? We have enough to live and bring\nthe year about, but not an ounce to impart or to\ninvest. Ah that our Genius were a little more of a\ngenius! We are like millers on the lower levels of\na stream, when the factories above them have\nexhausted the water. We too fancy that the upper\npeople must have raised their dams.",
        "If any of us knew what we were doing, or where we\nare going, then when we think we best know! We do\nnot know to-day whether we are busy or idle. In\ntimes when we thought ourselves indolent, we have\nafterwards discovered that much was accomplished,\nand much was begun in us. All our days are so\nunprofitable while they pass, that ’tis wonderful\nwhere or when we ever got anything of this which\nwe call wisdom, poetry, virtue. We never got it on\nany dated calendar day. Some heavenly days must have\nbeen intercalated somewhere, like those that Hermes\nwon with dice of the Moon, that Osiris might be born.\nIt is said all martyrdoms looked mean when they were\nsuffered. Every ship is a romantic object, except\nthat we sail in. Embark, and the romance quits our\nvessel and hangs on every other sail in the horizon.\nOur life looks trivial, and we shun to record it. Men\nseem to have learned of the horizon the art of\nperpetual retreating and reference. ’Yonder uplands\nare rich pasturage, and my neighbor has fertile\nmeadow, but my field,’ says the querulous farmer,\n’only holds the world together.’ I quote another man’s\nsaying; unluckily that other withdraws himself in the\nsame way, and quotes me. ’Tis the trick of nature\nthus to degrade to-day; a good deal of buzz, and\nsomewhere a result slipped magically in. Every roof is\nagreeable to the eye until it is lifted; then we find\ntragedy and moaning women and hard-eyed husbands and\ndeluges of lethe, and the men ask, ’What’s the news?’\nas if the old were so bad. How many individuals can we\ncount in society? how many actions? how many opinions?\nSo much of our time is preparation, so much is routine,\nand so much retrospect, that the pith of each man’s\ngenius contracts itself to a very few hours. The history\nof literature—take the net result of Tiraboschi, Warton,\nor Schlegel,—is a sum of very few ideas and of very few\noriginal tales; all the rest being variation of these.\nSo in this great society wide lying around us, a critical\nanalysis would find very few spontaneous actions. It is\nalmost all custom and gross sense. There are even few\nopinions, and these seem organic in the speakers, and do\nnot disturb the universal necessity.",

        "People grieve and bemoan themselves, but it is not\nhalf so bad with them as they say. There are moods\nin which we court suffering, in the hope that here\nat least we shall find reality, sharp peaks and\nedges of truth. But it turns out to be scene-painting\nand counterfeit. The only thing grief has taught me\nis to know how shallow it is. That, like all the rest,\nplays about the surface, and never introduces me into\nthe reality, for contact with which we would even pay\nthe costly price of sons and lovers. Was it Boscovich\nwho found out that bodies never come in contact? Well,\nsouls never touch their objects. An innavigable sea\nwashes with silent waves between us and the things we\naim at and converse with. Grief too will make us\nidealists. In the death of my son, now more than two\nyears ago, I seem to have lost a beautiful estate,—no\nmore. I cannot get it nearer to me. If to-morrow I\nshould be informed of the bankruptcy of my principal\ndebtors, the loss of my property would be a great\ninconvenience to me, perhaps, for many years; but it\nwould leave me as it found me,—neither better nor\nworse. So is it with this calamity: it does not touch\nme; something which I fancied was a part of me, which\ncould not be torn away without tearing me nor enlarged\nwithout enriching me, falls off from me and leaves no\nscar. It was caducous. I grieve that grief can teach\nme nothing, nor carry me one step into real nature.\nThe Indian who was laid under a curse that the wind\nshould not blow on him, nor water flow to him, nor\nfire burn him, is a type of us all.

Direct strokes she never\ngave us power to make; all our blows glance, all our\nhits are accidents. Our relations to each other are\noblique and casual.",
        "Dream delivers us to dream, and there is no end to\nillusion. Life is a train of moods like a string of\nbeads, and as we pass through them they prove to be\nmany-colored lenses which paint the world their own\nhue, and each shows only what lies in its focus. From\nthe mountain you see the mountain. We animate what we\ncan, and we see only what we animate. Nature and books\nbelong to the eyes that see them. It depends on the\nmood of the man whether he shall see the sunset or the\nfine poem. There are always sunsets, and there is\nalways genius; but only a few hours so serene that we\ncan relish nature or criticism.  The more or less\ndepends on structure or temperament. Temperament is the\niron wire on which the beads are strung. Of what use is\nfortune or talent to a cold and defective nature? Who\ncares what sensibility or discrimination a man has at\nsome time shown, if he falls asleep in his chair? or if\nhe laugh and giggle? or if he apologize? or is infected\nwith egotism? or thinks of his dollar? or cannot go by\nfood? or has gotten a child in his boyhood? Of what use\nis genius, if the organ is too convex or too concave\nand cannot find a focal distance within the actual\nhorizon of human life? Of what use, if the brain is too\ncold or too hot, and the man does not care enough for\nresults to stimulate him to experiment, and hold him up\nin it? or if the web is too finely woven, too irritable\nby pleasure and pain, so that life stagnates from too\nmuch reception without due outlet? Of what use to make\nheroic vows of amendment, if the same old law-breaker\nis to keep them? What cheer can the religious sentiment\nyield, when that is suspected to be secretly dependent\non the seasons of the year and the state of the blood?\nI knew a witty physician who found the creed in the\nbiliary duct, and used to affirm that if there was\ndisease in the liver, the man became a Calvinist, and\nif that organ was sound, he became a Unitarian. Very\nmortifying is the reluctant experience that some\nunfriendly excess or imbecility neutralizes the promise\nof genius. We see young men who owe us a new world, so\nreadily and lavishly they promise, but they never acquit\nthe debt; they die young and dodge the account; or if\nthey live they lose themselves in the crowd.",
        "Temperament also enters fully into the system of\nillusions and shuts us in a prison of glass which\nwe cannot see. There is an optical illusion about\nevery person we meet. In truth they are all\ncreatures of given temperament, which will appear\nin a given character, whose boundaries they will\nnever pass: but we look at them, they seem alive,\nand we presume there is impulse in them. In the\nmoment it seems impulse; in the year, in the lifetime,\nit turns out to be a certain uniform tune which the\nrevolving barrel of the music-box must play. Men\nresist the conclusion in the morning, but adopt it\nas the evening wears on, that temper prevails over\neverything of time, place, and condition, and is\ninconsumable in the flames of religion. Some\nmodifications the moral sentiment avails to impose,\nbut the individual texture holds its dominion, if not\nto bias the moral judgments, yet to fix the measure\nof activity and of enjoyment.",
        "I thus express the law as it is read from the\nplatform of ordinary life, but must not leave\nit without noticing the capital exception. For\ntemperament is a power which no man willingly\nhears any one praise but himself. On the platform\nof physics we cannot resist the contracting\ninfluences of so-called science.  Temperament puts\nall divinity to rout. I know the mental proclivity\nof physicians. I hear the chuckle of the phrenologists.\nTheoretic kidnappers and slave-drivers, they esteem\neach man the victim of another, who winds him round\nhis finger by knowing the law of his being; and by\nsuch cheap signboards as the color of his beard or\nthe slope of his occiput, reads the inventory of his\nfortunes and character. The grossest ignorance does\nnot disgust like this impudent knowingness. The\nphysicians say they are not materialists; but they\nare:—Spirit is matter reduced to an extreme thinness:\nO so thin!—But the definition of spiritual should be,\nthat which is its own evidence. What notions do they\nattach to love!  what to religion! One would not\nwillingly pronounce these words in their hearing,\nand give them the occasion to profane them. I saw a\ngracious gentleman who adapts his conversation to the\nform of the head of the man he talks with! I had\nfancied that the value of life lay in its inscrutable\npossibilities; in the fact that I never know, in\naddressing myself to a new individual, what may befall\nme. I carry the keys of my castle in my hand, ready to\nthrow them at the feet of my lord, whenever and in what\ndisguise soever he shall appear. I know he is in the\nneighborhood hidden among vagabonds. Shall I preclude\nmy future by taking a high seat and kindly adapting my\nconversation to the shape of heads? When I come to that,\nthe doctors shall buy me for a cent.—’But, sir, medical\nhistory; the report to the Institute; the proven facts!’\n—I distrust the facts and the inferences. Temperament\nis the veto or limitation-power in the constitution,\nvery justly applied to restrain an opposite excess in\nthe constitution, but absurdly offered as a bar to\noriginal equity. When virtue is in presence, all\nsubordinate powers sleep. On its own level, or in\nview of nature, temperament is final. I see not, if\none be once caught in this trap of so-called sciences,\nany escape for the man from the links of the chain of\nphysical necessity. Given such an embryo, such a\nhistory must follow. On this platform one lives in a\nsty of sensualism, and would soon come to suicide.\nBut it is impossible that the creative power should\nexclude itself. Into every intelligence there is a door\nwhich is never closed, through which the creator passes.\nThe intellect, seeker of absolute truth, or the heart,\nlover of absolute good, intervenes for our succor, and\nat one whisper of these high powers we awake from\nineffectual struggles with this nightmare. We hurl it\ninto its own hell, and cannot again contract ourselves\nto so base a state.",
        "The secret of the illusoriness is in the necessity\nof a succession of moods or objects. Gladly we would\nanchor, but the anchorage is quicksand. This onward\ntrick of nature is too strong for us: Pero si muove.\nWhen at night I look at the moon and stars, I seem\nstationary, and they to hurry. Our love of the real\ndraws us to permanence, but health of body consists\nin circulation, and sanity of mind in variety or\nfacility of association. We need change of objects.\nDedication to one thought is quickly odious. We house\nwith the insane, and must humor them; then conversation\ndies out. Once I took such delight in Montaigne, that\nI thought I should not need any other book; before that,\nin Shakspeare; then in Plutarch; then in Plotinus; at\none time in Bacon; afterwards in Goethe; even in Bettine;\nbut now I turn the pages of either of them languidly,\nwhilst I still cherish their genius. So with pictures;\neach will bear an emphasis of attention once, which it\ncannot retain, though we fain would continue to be\npleased in that manner. How strongly I have felt of\npictures that when you have seen one well, you must\ntake your leave of it; you shall never see it again.\nI have had good lessons from pictures which I have\nsince seen without emotion or remark. A deduction must\nbe made from the opinion which even the wise express\nof a new book or occurrence. Their opinion gives me\ntidings of their mood, and some vague guess at the\nnew fact, but is nowise to be trusted as the lasting\nrelation between that intellect and that thing. The\nchild asks, ’Mamma, why don’t I like the story as well\nas when you told it me yesterday?’ Alas! child it is\neven so with the oldest cherubim of knowledge. But\nwill it answer thy question to say, Because thou wert\nborn to a whole and this story is a particular? The\nreason of the pain this discovery causes us (and we\nmake it late in respect to works of art and intellect),\nis the plaint of tragedy which murmurs from it in regard\nto persons, to friendship and love.",
        "That immobility and absence of elasticity which\nwe find in the arts, we find with more pain in the\nartist.  There is no power of expansion in men. Our\nfriends early appear to us as representatives of\ncertain ideas which they never pass or exceed. They\nstand on the brink of the ocean of thought and power,\nbut they never take the single step that would bring\nthem there. A man is like a bit of Labrador spar,\nwhich has no lustre as you turn it in your hand until\nyou come to a particular angle; then it shows deep\nand beautiful colors. There is no adaptation or\nuniversal applicability in men, but each has his\nspecial talent, and the mastery of successful men\nconsists in adroitly keeping themselves where and\nwhen that turn shall be oftenest to be practised.\nWe do what we must, and call it by the best names\nwe can, and would fain have the praise of having\nintended the result which ensues. I cannot recall\nany form of man who is not superfluous sometimes.\nBut is not this pitiful? Life is not worth the\ntaking, to do tricks in.",
        "Of course it needs the whole society to give the\nsymmetry we seek. The party-colored wheel must\nrevolve very fast to appear white. Something is\nearned too by conversing with so much folly and\ndefect.  In fine, whoever loses, we are always of\nthe gaining party. Divinity is behind our failures\nand follies also.  The plays of children are nonsense,\nbut very educative nonsense. So it is with the largest\nand solemnest things, with commerce, government,\nchurch, marriage, and so with the history of every\nman’s bread, and the ways by which he is to come by\nit. Like a bird which alights nowhere, but hops\nperpetually from bough to bough, is the Power which\nabides in no man and in no woman, but for a moment\nspeaks from this one, and for another moment from\nthat one.",
        "But what help from these fineries or pedantries?\nWhat help from thought? Life is not dialectics.\nWe, I think, in these times, have had lessons\nenough of the futility of criticism. Our young\npeople have thought and written much on labor and\nreform, and for all that they have written, neither\nthe world nor themselves have got on a step.\nIntellectual tasting of life will not supersede\nmuscular activity. If a man should consider the\nnicety of the passage of a piece of bread down his\nthroat, he would starve. At Education-Farm, the\nnoblest theory of life sat on the noblest figures\nof young men and maidens, quite powerless and\nmelancholy. It would not rake or pitch a ton of hay;\nit would not rub down a horse; and the men and\nmaidens it left pale and hungry. A political orator\nwittily compared our party promises to western roads,\nwhich opened stately enough, with planted trees on\neither side to tempt the traveller, but soon became\nnarrow and narrower and ended in a squirrel-track\nand ran up a tree. So does culture with us; it ends\nin headache. Unspeakably sad and barren does life\nlook to those who a few months ago were dazzled with\nthe splendor of the promise of the times. “There is\nnow no longer any right course of action nor any\nself-devotion left among the Iranis.” Objections and\ncriticism we have had our fill of. There are objections\nto every course of life and action, and the practical\nwisdom infers an indifferency, from the omnipresence\nof objection. The whole frame of things preaches\nindifferency. Do not craze yourself with thinking, but\ngo about your business anywhere. Life is not intellectual\nor critical, but sturdy. Its chief good is for well-mixed\npeople who can enjoy what they find, without question.\nNature hates peeping, and our mothers speak her very\nsense when they say, “Children, eat your victuals, and\nsay no more of it.” To fill the hour,—that is happiness;\nto fill the hour and leave no crevice for a repentance\nor an approval. We live amid surfaces, and the true art\nof life is to skate well on them. Under the oldest\nmouldiest conventions a man of native force prospers\njust as well as in the newest world, and that by skill\nof handling and treatment. He can take hold anywhere.\nLife itself is a mixture of power and form, and will\nnot bear the least excess of either. To finish the\nmoment, to find the journey’s end in every step of the\nroad, to live the greatest number of good hours, is\nwisdom. It is not the part of men, but of fanatics,\nor of mathematicians if you will, to say that the\nshortness of life considered, it is not worth caring\nwhether for so short a duration we were sprawling in\nwant or sitting high. Since our office is with moments,\nlet us husband them. Five minutes of today are worth\nas much to me as five minutes in the next millennium.\nLet us be poised, and wise, and our own, today. Let us\ntreat the men and women well; treat them as if they\nwere real; perhaps they are. Men live in their fancy,\nlike drunkards whose hands are too soft and tremulous\nfor successful labor. It is a tempest of fancies, and\nthe only ballast I know is a respect to the present\nhour. Without any shadow of doubt, amidst this vertigo\nof shows and politics, I settle myself ever the firmer\nin the creed that we should not postpone and refer and\nwish, but do broad justice where we are, by whomsoever\nwe deal with, accepting our actual companions and\ncircumstances, however humble or odious as the mystic\nofficials to whom the universe has delegated its\nwhole pleasure for us. If these are mean and malignant,\ntheir contentment, which is the last victory of justice,\nis a more satisfying echo to the heart than the voice\nof poets and the casual sympathy of admirable persons.\nI think that however a thoughtful man may suffer from\nthe defects and absurdities of his company, he cannot\nwithout affectation deny to any set of men and women\na sensibility to extraordinary merit. The coarse and\nfrivolous have an instinct of superiority, if they have\nnot a sympathy, and honor it in their blind capricious\nway with sincere homage.",
        "The fine young people despise life, but in me,\nand in such as with me are free from dyspepsia,\nand to whom a day is a sound and solid good, it\nis a great excess of politeness to look scornful\nand to cry for company. I am grown by sympathy a\nlittle eager and sentimental, but leave me alone\nand I should relish every hour and what it brought\nme, the potluck of the day, as heartily as the oldest\ngossip in the bar-room. I am thankful for small\nmercies. I compared notes with one of my friends\nwho expects everything of the universe and is\ndisappointed when anything is less than the best,\nand I found that I begin at the other extreme,\nexpecting nothing, and am always full of thanks for\nmoderate goods. I accept the clangor and jangle of\ncontrary tendencies. I find my account in sots and\nbores also. They give a reality to the circumjacent\npicture which such a vanishing meteorous appearance\ncan ill spare. In the morning I awake and find the\nold world, wife, babes, and mother, Concord and\nBoston, the dear old spiritual world and even the\ndear old devil not far off. If we will take the good\nwe find, asking no questions, we shall have heaping\nmeasures. The great gifts are not got by analysis.\nEverything good is on the highway. The middle region\nof our being is the temperate zone. We may climb\ninto the thin and cold realm of pure geometry and\nlifeless science, or sink into that of sensation.\nBetween these extremes is the equator of life, of\nthought, of spirit, of poetry,—a narrow belt.\nMoreover, in popular experience everything good is\non the highway. A collector peeps into all the\npicture-shops of Europe for a landscape of Poussin,\na crayon-sketch of Salvator; but the Transfiguration,\nthe Last Judgment, the Communion of St. Jerome, and\nwhat are as transcendent as these, are on the walls\nof the Vatican, the Uffizii, or the Louvre, where\nevery footman may see them; to say nothing of Nature’s\npictures in every street, of sunsets and sunrises\nevery day, and the sculpture of the human body never\nabsent. A collector recently bought at public auction,\nin London, for one hundred and fifty-seven guineas,\nan autograph of Shakspeare; but for nothing a school-boy\ncan read Hamlet and can detect secrets of highest\nconcernment yet unpublished therein. I think I will\nnever read any but the commonest books,—the Bible,\nHomer, Dante, Shakspeare, and Milton. Then we are\nimpatient of so public a life and planet, and run\nhither and thither for nooks and secrets. The\nimagination delights in the woodcraft of Indians,\ntrappers, and bee-hunters. We fancy that we are\nstrangers, and not so intimately domesticated in the\nplanet as the wild man and the wild beast and bird.\nBut the exclusion reaches them also; reaches the\nclimbing, flying, gliding, feathered and four-footed\nman. Fox and woodchuck, hawk and snipe and bittern,\nwhen nearly seen, have no more root in the deep world\nthan man, and are just such superficial tenants of the\nglobe.  Then the new molecular philosophy shows\nastronomical interspaces betwixt atom and atom, shows\nthat the world is all outside; it has no inside.",
        "The mid-world is best. Nature, as we know her, is\nno saint. The lights of the church, the ascetics,\nGentoos, and corn-eaters, she does not distinguish\nby any favor. She comes eating and drinking and\nsinning. Her darlings, the great, the strong, the\nbeautiful, are not children of our law; do not come\nout of the Sunday School, nor weigh their food, nor\npunctually keep the commandments. If we will be\nstrong with her strength we must not harbor such\ndisconsolate consciences, borrowed too from the\nconsciences of other nations. We must set up the\nstrong present tense against all the rumors of\nwrath, past or to come. So many things are unsettled\nwhich it is of the first importance to settle;—and,\npending their settlement, we will do as we do. Whilst\nthe debate goes forward on the equity of commerce,\nand will not be closed for a century or two, New and\nOld England may keep shop. Law of copyright and\ninternational copyright is to be discussed, and in\nthe interim we will sell our books for the most we\ncan.  Expediency of literature, reason of literature,\nlawfulness of writing down a thought, is questioned;\nmuch is to say on both sides, and, while the fight\nwaxes hot, thou, dearest scholar, stick to thy\nfoolish task, add a line every hour, and between\nwhiles add a line. Right to hold land, right of\nproperty, is disputed, and the conventions convene,\nand before the vote is taken, dig away in your garden,\nand spend your earnings as a waif or godsend to all\nserene and beautiful purposes. Life itself is a bubble\nand a skepticism, and a sleep within a sleep. Grant it,\nand as much more as they will,—but thou, God’s darling!\nheed thy private dream; thou wilt not be missed in the\nscorning and skepticism; there are enough of them;\nstay there in thy closet and toil until the rest are\nagreed what to do about it. Thy sickness, they say,\nand thy puny habit require that thou do this or avoid\nthat, but know that thy life is a flitting state, a\ntent for a night, and do thou, sick or well, finish\nthat stint. Thou art sick, but shalt not be worse,\nand the universe, which holds thee dear, shall be the\nbetter.",
        "Human life is made up of the two elements, power\nand form, and the proportion must be invariably\nkept if we would have it sweet and sound. Each\nof these elements in excess makes a mischief as\nhurtful as its defect. Everything runs to excess;\nevery good quality is noxious if unmixed, and, to\ncarry the danger to the edge of ruin, nature\ncauses each man’s peculiarity to superabound. Here,\namong the farms, we adduce the scholars as examples\nof this treachery. They are nature’s victims of\nexpression. You who see the artist, the orator,\nthe poet, too near, and find their life no more\nexcellent than that of mechanics or farmers, and\nthemselves victims of partiality, very hollow and\nhaggard, and pronounce them failures, not heroes,\nbut quacks,—conclude very reasonably that these\narts are not for man, but are disease. Yet nature\nwill not bear you out. Irresistible nature made\nmen such, and makes legions more of such, every\nday. You love the boy reading in a book, gazing\nat a drawing, or a cast; yet what are these millions\nwho read and behold, but incipient writers and\nsculptors? Add a little more of that quality which\nnow reads and sees, and they will seize the pen and\nchisel. And if one remembers how innocently he began\nto be an artist, he perceives that nature joined with\nhis enemy. A man is a golden impossibility. The line\nhe must walk is a hair’s breadth. The wise through\nexcess of wisdom is made a fool.",
        "How easily, if fate would suffer it, we might\nkeep forever these beautiful limits, and adjust\nourselves, once for all, to the perfect calculation\nof the kingdom of known cause and effect. In the\nstreet and in the newspapers, life appears so plain\na business that manly resolution and adherence to\nthe multiplication-table through all weathers will\ninsure success. But ah! presently comes a day, or\nis it only a half-hour, with its angel-whispering,\n—which discomfits the conclusions of nations and\nof years!  Tomorrow again everything looks real and\nangular, the habitual standards are reinstated,\ncommon sense is as rare as genius,—is the basis of\ngenius, and experience is hands and feet to every\nenterprise;—and yet, he who should do his business\non this understanding would be quickly bankrupt.\nPower keeps quite another road than the turnpikes\nof choice and will; namely the subterranean and\ninvisible tunnels and channels of life. It is\nridiculous that we are diplomatists, and doctors,\nand considerate people: there are no dupes like\nthese. Life is a series of surprises, and would not\nbe worth taking or keeping if it were not.  God\ndelights to isolate us every day, and hide from us\nthe past and the future. We would look about us,\nbut with grand politeness he draws down before us\nan impenetrable screen of purest sky, and another\nbehind us of purest sky. ’You will not remember,’\nhe seems to say, `and you will not expect.’ All\ngood conversation, manners, and action, come from\na spontaneity which forgets usages and makes the\nmoment great. Nature hates calculators; her methods\nare saltatory and impulsive. Man lives by pulses;\nour organic movements are such; and the chemical\nand ethereal agents are undulatory and alternate;\nand the mind goes antagonizing on, and never\nprospers but by fits. We thrive by casualties. Our\nchief experiences have been casual. The most\nattractive class of people are those who are\npowerful obliquely and not by the direct stroke;\nmen of genius, but not yet accredited; one gets the\ncheer of their light without paying too great a tax.\nTheirs is the beauty of the bird or the morning\nlight, and not of art. In the thought of genius\nthere is always a surprise; and the moral sentiment\nis well called “the newness,” for it is never other;\nas new to the oldest intelligence as to the young\nchild;—\"the kingdom that cometh without observation.\"\nIn like manner, for practical success, there must not\nbe too much design. A man will not be observed in\ndoing that which he can do best. There is a certain\nmagic about his properest action which stupefies\nyour powers of observation, so that though it is done\nbefore you, you wist not of it. The art of life has a\npudency, and will not be exposed. Every man is an\nimpossibility until he is born; every thing impossible\nuntil we see a success. The ardors of piety agree at\nlast with the coldest skepticism,—that nothing is of\nus or our works,—that all is of God. Nature will not\nspare us the smallest leaf of laurel. All writing\ncomes by the grace of God, and all doing and having.\nI would gladly be moral and keep due metes and bounds,\nwhich I dearly love, and allow the most to the will of\nman; but I have set my heart on honesty in this chapter,\nand I can see nothing at last, in success or failure,\nthan more or less of vital force supplied from the\nEternal. The results of life are uncalculated and\nuncalculable. The years teach much which the days\nnever know. The persons who compose our company,\nconverse, and come and go, and design and execute\nmany things, and somewhat comes of it all, but an\nunlooked-for result. The individual is always mistaken.\nHe designed many things, and drew in other persons as\ncoadjutors, quarrelled with some or all, blundered much,\nand something is done; all are a little advanced, but\nthe individual is always mistaken. It turns out somewhat\nnew and very unlike what he promised himself.",
        "The ancients, struck with this irreducibleness of\nthe elements of human life to calculation, exalted\nChance into a divinity; but that is to stay too\nlong at the spark, which glitters truly at one\npoint, but the universe is warm with the latency\nof the same fire. The miracle of life which will\nnot be expounded but will remain a miracle,\nintroduces a new element. In the growth of the\nembryo, Sir Everard Home I think noticed that the\nevolution was not from one central point, but\ncoactive from three or more points. Life has no\nmemory. That which proceeds in succession might be\nremembered, but that which is coexistent, or\nejaculated from a deeper cause, as yet far from\nbeing conscious, knows not its own tendency. So is\nit with us, now skeptical or without unity, because\nimmersed in forms and effects all seeming to be of\nequal yet hostile value, and now religious, whilst\nin the reception of spiritual law. Bear with these\ndistractions, with this coetaneous growth of the\nparts; they will one day be members, and obey one\nwill.  On that one will, on that secret cause, they\nnail our attention and hope. Life is hereby melted\ninto an expectation or a religion. Underneath the\ninharmonious and trivial particulars, is a musical\nperfection; the Ideal journeying always with us, the\nheaven without rent or seam. Do but observe the mode\nof our illumination. When I converse with a profound\nmind, or if at any time being alone I have good\nthoughts, I do not at once arrive at satisfactions,\nas when, being thirsty, I drink water; or go to the\nfire, being cold; no! but I am at first apprised of\nmy vicinity to a new and excellent region of life.\nBy persisting to read or to think, this region gives\nfurther sign of itself, as it were in flashes of light,\nin sudden discoveries of its profound beauty and repose,\nas if the clouds that covered it parted at intervals\nand showed the approaching traveller the inland\nmountains, with the tranquil eternal meadows spread at\ntheir base, whereon flocks graze and shepherds pipe and\ndance. But every insight from this realm of thought is\nfelt as initial, and promises a sequel. I do not make\nit; I arrive there, and behold what was there already.\nI make! O no! I clap my hands in infantine joy and\namazement before the first opening to me of this august\nmagnificence, old with the love and homage of innumerable\nages, young with the life of life, the sunbright Mecca\nof the desert. And what a future it opens! I feel a new\nheart beating with the love of the new beauty. I am\nready to die out of nature and be born again into this\nnew yet unapproachable America I have found in the West:—",
        "If I have described life as a flux of moods, I must\nnow add that there is that in us which changes not\nand which ranks all sensations and states of mind.\nThe consciousness in each man is a sliding scale,\nwhich identifies him now with the First Cause, and\nnow with the flesh of his body; life above life, in\ninfinite degrees. The sentiment from which it sprung\ndetermines the dignity of any deed, and the question\never is, not what you have done or forborne, but at\nwhose command you have done or forborne it.",
        "Fortune, Minerva, Muse, Holy Ghost,—these are\nquaint names, too narrow to cover this unbounded\nsubstance. The baffled intellect must still kneel\nbefore this cause, which refuses to be named,—\nineffable cause, which every fine genius has essayed\nto represent by some emphatic symbol, as, Thales by\nwater, Anaximenes by air, Anaxagoras by (Nous)\nthought, Zoroaster by fire, Jesus and the moderns by\nlove; and the metaphor of each has become a national\nreligion. The Chinese Mencius has not been the least\nsuccessful in his generalization. “I fully understand\nlanguage,” he said, “and nourish well my vast-flowing\nvigor.\"—\"I beg to ask what you call vast-flowing\nvigor?\"—said his companion. “The explanation,” replied\nMencius, “is difficult. This vigor is supremely great,\nand in the highest degree unbending. Nourish it\ncorrectly and do it no injury, and it will fill up\nthe vacancy between heaven and earth. This vigor\naccords with and assists justice and reason, and\nleaves no hunger.\"—In our more correct writing we\ngive to this generalization the name of Being, and\nthereby confess that we have arrived as far as we can\ngo. Suffice it for the joy of the universe that we\nhave not arrived at a wall, but at interminable oceans.\nOur life seems not present so much as prospective; not\nfor the affairs on which it is wasted, but as a hint\nof this vast-flowing vigor. Most of life seems to be\nmere advertisement of faculty; information is given us\nnot to sell ourselves cheap; that we are very great. So,\nin particulars, our greatness is always in a tendency\nor direction, not in an action. It is for us to believe\nin the rule, not in the exception. The noble are thus\nknown from the ignoble. So in accepting the leading of\nthe sentiments, it is not what we believe concerning the\nimmortality of the soul or the like, but the universal\nimpulse to believe, that is the material circumstance\nand is the principal fact in the history of the globe.\nShall we describe this cause as that which works\ndirectly? The spirit is not helpless or needful of\nmediate organs. It has plentiful powers and direct\neffects. I am explained without explaining, I am felt\nwithout acting, and where I am not. Therefore all just\npersons are satisfied with their own praise. They refuse\nto explain themselves, and are content that new actions\nshould do them that office. They believe that we\ncommunicate without speech and above speech, and that\nno right action of ours is quite unaffecting to our\nfriends, at whatever distance; for the influence of\naction is not to be measured by miles. Why should I\nfret myself because a circumstance has occurred which\nhinders my presence where I was expected? If I am not\nat the meeting, my presence where I am should be as\nuseful to the commonwealth of friendship and wisdom,\nas would be my presence in that place. I exert the\nsame quality of power in all places. Thus journeys\nthe mighty Ideal before us; it never was known to fall\ninto the rear. No man ever came to an experience which\nwas satiating, but his good is tidings of a better.\nOnward and onward! In liberated moments we know that\na new picture of life and duty is already possible;\nthe elements already exist in many minds around you\nof a doctrine of life which shall transcend any\nwritten record we have. The new statement will comprise\nthe skepticisms as well as the faiths of society, and\nout of unbeliefs a creed shall be formed. For skepticisms\nare not gratuitous or lawless, but are limitations of the\naffirmative statement, and the new philosophy must take\nthem in and make affirmations outside of them, just as\nmuch as it must include the oldest beliefs.",
        "It is very unhappy, but too late to be helped,\nthe discovery we have made that we exist. That\ndiscovery is called the Fall of Man. Ever afterwards\nwe suspect our instruments. We have learned that we\ndo not see directly, but mediately, and that we have\nno means of correcting these colored and distorting\nlenses which we are, or of computing the amount of\ntheir errors. Perhaps these subject-lenses have a\ncreative power; perhaps there are no objects. Once\nwe lived in what we saw; now, the rapaciousness of\nthis new power, which threatens to absorb all things,\nengages us. Nature, art, persons, letters, religions,\nobjects, successively tumble in, and God is but one\nof its ideas. Nature and literature are subjective\nphenomena; every evil and every good thing is a shadow\nwhich we cast. The street is full of humiliations to\nthe proud.  As the fop contrived to dress his bailiffs\nin his livery and make them wait on his guests at\ntable, so the chagrins which the bad heart gives off\nas bubbles, at once take form as ladies and gentlemen\nin the street, shopmen or bar-keepers in hotels, and\nthreaten or insult whatever is threatenable and\ninsultable in us. ’Tis the same with our idolatries.\nPeople forget that it is the eye which makes the\nhorizon, and the rounding mind’s eye which makes this\nor that man a type or representative of humanity, with\nthe name of hero or saint. Jesus, the “providential\nman,” is a good man on whom many people are agreed that\nthese optical laws shall take effect. By love on one\npart and by forbearance to press objection on the other\npart, it is for a time settled, that we will look at\nhim in the centre of the horizon, and ascribe to him\nthe properties that will attach to any man so seen. But\nthe longest love or aversion has a speedy term. The great\nand crescive self, rooted in absolute nature, supplants\nall relative existence and ruins the kingdom of mortal\nfriendship and love. Marriage (in what is called the\nspiritual world) is impossible, because of the inequality\nbetween every subject and every object. The subject is\nthe receiver of Godhead, and at every comparison must\nfeel his being enhanced by that cryptic might. Though not\nin energy, yet by presence, this magazine of substance\ncannot be otherwise than felt; nor can any force of\nintellect attribute to the object the proper deity which\nsleeps or wakes forever in every subject. Never can love\nmake consciousness and ascription equal in force. There\nwill be the same gulf between every me and thee as\nbetween the original and the picture. The universe is\nthe bride of the soul. All private sympathy is partial.\nTwo human beings are like globes, which can touch only\nin a point, and whilst they remain in contact, all other\npoints of each of the spheres are inert; their turn must\nalso come, and the longer a particular union lasts the\nmore energy of appetency the parts not in union acquire.",
        "Life will be imaged, but cannot be divided nor\ndoubled. Any invasion of its unity would be chaos.\nThe soul is not twin-born but the only begotten,\nand though revealing itself as child in time, child\nin appearance, is of a fatal and universal power,\nadmitting no co-life. Every day, every act betrays\nthe ill-concealed deity. We believe in ourselves as\nwe do not believe in others. We permit all things to\nourselves, and that which we call sin in others is\nexperiment for us. It is an instance of our faith in\nourselves that men never speak of crime as lightly\nas they think; or every man thinks a latitude safe\nfor himself which is nowise to be indulged to another.\nThe act looks very differently on the inside and on\nthe outside; in its quality and in its consequences.\nMurder in the murderer is no such ruinous thought as\npoets and romancers will have it; it does not unsettle\nhim or fright him from his ordinary notice of trifles;\nit is an act quite easy to be contemplated; but in\nits sequel it turns out to be a horrible jangle and\nconfounding of all relations. Especially the crimes\nthat spring from love seem right and fair from the\nactor’s point of view, but when acted are found\ndestructive of society. No man at last believes that\nhe can be lost, nor that the crime in him is as black\nas in the felon. Because the intellect qualifies in\nour own case the moral judgments. For there is no\ncrime to the intellect. That is antinomian or hypernomian,\nand judges law as well as fact. “It is worse than a\ncrime, it is a blunder,” said Napoleon, speaking the\nlanguage of the intellect. To it, the world is a problem\nin mathematics or the science of quantity, and it\nleaves out praise and blame and all weak emotions. All\nstealing is comparative. If you come to absolutes,\npray who does not steal? Saints are sad, because they\nbehold sin (even when they speculate), from the point\nof view of the conscience, and not of the intellect;\na confusion of thought. Sin, seen from the thought,\nis a diminution, or less: seen from the conscience or\nwill, it is pravity or bad. The intellect names it\nshade, absence of light, and no essence.

        "Thus inevitably does the universe wear our color,\nand every object fall successively into the subject\nitself.  The subject exists, the subject enlarges;\nall things sooner or later fall into place. As I am,\nso I see; use what language we will, we can never\nsay anything but what we are; Hermes, Cadmus, Columbus,\nNewton, Bonaparte, are the mind’s ministers. Instead\nof feeling a poverty when we encounter a great man,\nlet us treat the new comer like a travelling geologist\nwho passes through our estate and shows us good slate,\nor limestone, or anthracite, in our brush pasture.\nThe partial action of each strong mind in one direction\nis a telescope for the objects on which it is pointed.\nBut every other part of knowledge is to be pushed to\nthe same extravagance, ere the soul attains her due\nsphericity. Do you see that kitten chasing so prettily\nher own tail? If you could look with her eyes you\nmight see her surrounded with hundreds of figures\nperforming complex dramas, with tragic and comic\nissues, long conversations, many characters, many ups\nand downs of fate,—and meantime it is only puss and\nher tail. How long before our masquerade will end its\nnoise of tambourines, laughter, and shouting, and we\nshall find it was a solitary performance? A subject\nand an object,—it takes so much to make the galvanic\ncircuit complete, but magnitude adds nothing. What\nimports it whether it is Kepler and the sphere, Columbus\nand America, a reader and his book, or puss with her tail?",
        "It is true that all the muses and love and religion\nhate these developments, and will find a way to\npunish the chemist who publishes in the parlor the\nsecrets of the laboratory. And we cannot say too\nlittle of our constitutional necessity of seeing\nthings under private aspects, or saturated with our\nhumors. And yet is the God the native of these bleak\nrocks. That need makes in morals the capital virtue\nof self-trust. We must hold hard to this poverty,\nhowever scandalous, and by more vigorous self-recoveries,\nafter the sallies of action, possess our axis more\nfirmly. The life of truth is cold and so far mournful;\nbut it is not the slave of tears, contritions and\nperturbations. It does not attempt another’s work,\nnor adopt another’s facts. It is a main lesson of\nwisdom to know your own from another’s. I have learned\nthat I cannot dispose of other people’s facts; but I\npossess such a key to my own as persuades me, against\nall their denials, that they also have a key to theirs.\nA sympathetic person is placed in the dilemma of a\nswimmer among drowning men, who all catch at him, and\nif he give so much as a leg or a finger they will drown\nhim.

        "In this our talking America we are ruined by our good\nnature and listening on all sides. This compliance\ntakes away the power of being greatly useful. A man\nshould not be able to look other than directly and\nforthright. A preoccupied attention is the only answer\nto the importunate frivolity of other people; an\nattention, and to an aim which makes their wants\nfrivolous. This is a divine answer, and leaves no\nappeal and no hard thoughts. In Flaxman’s drawing\nof the Eumenides of Aeschylus, Orestes supplicates\nApollo, whilst the Furies sleep on the threshold.\nThe face of the god expresses a shade of regret and\ncompassion, but is calm with the conviction of the\nirreconcilableness of the two spheres. He is born\ninto other politics, into the eternal and beautiful.\nThe man at his feet asks for his interest in turmoils\nof the earth, into which his nature cannot enter. And\nthe Eumenides there lying express pictorially this\ndisparity. The god is surcharged with his divine destiny.",
        "Illusion, Temperament, Succession, Surface, Surprise,\nReality, Subjectiveness,—these are threads on the\nloom of time, these are the lords of life. I dare not\nassume to give their order, but I name them as I find\nthem in my way. I know better than to claim any\ncompleteness for my picture. I am a fragment, and this\nis a fragment of me. I can very confidently announce\none or another law, which throws itself into relief\nand form, but I am too young yet by some ages to\ncompile a code. I gossip for my hour concerning the\neternal politics. I have seen many fair pictures not\nin vain. A wonderful time I have lived in. I am not\nthe novice I was fourteen, nor yet seven years ago.\nLet who will ask Where is the fruit? I find a private\nfruit sufficient. This is a fruit,—that I should not\nask for a rash effect from meditations, counsels and\nthe hiving of truths. I should feel it pitiful to\ndemand a result on this town and county, an overt\neffect on the instant month and year. The effect is\ndeep and secular as the cause. It works on periods in\nwhich mortal lifetime is lost. All I know is reception;\nI am and I have: but I do not get, and when I have\nfancied I had gotten anything, I found I did not. I\nworship with wonder the great Fortune. My reception has\nbeen so large, that I am not annoyed by receiving this\nor that superabundantly. I say to the Genius, if he will\npardon the proverb, In for a mill, in for a million. When\nI receive a new gift, I do not macerate my body to make\nthe account square, for if I should die I could not make\nthe account square. The benefit overran the merit the\nfirst day, and has overrun the merit ever since. The\nmerit itself, so-called, I reckon part of the receiving.",
        "Also that hankering after an overt or practical\neffect seems to me an apostasy. In good earnest\nI am willing to spare this most unnecessary deal\nof doing. Life wears to me a visionary face.\nHardest roughest action is visionary also. It is\nbut a choice between soft and turbulent dreams.\nPeople disparage knowing and the intellectual life,\nand urge doing. I am very content with knowing, if\nonly I could know. That is an august entertainment,\nand would suffice me a great while. To know a little\nwould be worth the expense of this world. I hear\nalways the law of Adrastia, “that every soul which\nhad acquired any truth, should be safe from harm\nuntil another period.”",
        "I know that the world I converse with in the city\nand in the farms, is not the world I think. I observe\nthat difference, and shall observe it. One day I shall\nknow the value and law of this discrepance. But I have\nnot found that much was gained by manipular attempts\nto realize the world of thought. Many eager persons\nsuccessively make an experiment in this way, and make\nthemselves ridiculous. They acquire democratic manners,\nthey foam at the mouth, they hate and deny. Worse, I\nobserve that in the history of mankind there is never\na solitary example of success,—taking their own tests\nof success. I say this polemically, or in reply to the\ninquiry, Why not realize your world? But far be from\nme the despair which prejudges the law by a paltry\nempiricism;—since there never was a right endeavor\nbut it succeeded.  Patience and patience, we shall win\nat the last. We must be very suspicious of the deceptions\nof the element of time. It takes a good deal of time to\neat or to sleep, or to earn a hundred dollars, and a\nvery little time to entertain a hope and an insight\nwhich becomes the light of our life. We dress our garden,\neat our dinners, discuss the household with our wives,\nand these things make no impression, are forgotten next\nweek; but, in the solitude to which every man is always\nreturning, he has a sanity and revelations which in his\npassage into new worlds he will carry with him. Never\nmind the ridicule, never mind the defeat; up again, old\nheart!—it seems to say,—there is victory yet for all\njustice; and the true romance which the world exists to\nrealize will be the transformation of genius into\npractical power.",
        "I HAVE read that those who listened to Lord Chatham\nfelt that there was something finer in the man than\nany thing which he said. It has been complained of\nour brilliant English historian of the French\nRevolution that when he has told all his facts about\nMirabeau, they do not justify his estimate of his\ngenius. The Gracchi, Agis, Cleomenes, and others of\nPlutarch’s heroes, do not in the record of facts equal\ntheir own fame. Sir Philip Sidney, the Earl of Essex,\nSir Walter Raleigh, are men of great figure and of\nfew deeds.  We cannot find the smallest part of the\npersonal weight of Washington in the narrative of his\nexploits.  The authority of the name of Schiller is\ntoo great for his books. This inequality of the\nreputation to the works or the anecdotes is not\naccounted for by saying that the reverberation is\nlonger than the thunder-clap, but somewhat resided\nin these men which begot an expectation that outran\nall their performance. The largest part of their power\nwas latent. This is that which we call Character,—a\nreserved force which acts directly by presence, and\nwithout means. It is conceived of as a certain\nundemonstrable force, a Familiar or Genius, by whose\nimpulses the man is guided but whose counsels he\ncannot impart; which is company for him, so that such\nmen are often solitary, or if they chance to be social,\ndo not need society but can entertain themselves very\nwell alone. The purest literary talent appears at one\ntime great, at another time small, but character is of\na stellar and undiminishable greatness.  What others\neffect by talent or by eloquence, this man accomplishes\nby some magnetism. “Half his strength he put not forth.\"\nHis victories are by demonstration of superiority, and\nnot by crossing of bayonets. He conquers because his\narrival alters the face of affairs. “O Iole! how did\nyou know that Hercules was a god?” “Because,” answered\nIole, “I was content the moment my eyes fell on him.\nWhen I beheld Theseus, I desired that I might see him\noffer battle, or at least guide his horses in the\nchariot-race; but Hercules did not wait for a contest;\nhe conquered whether he stood, or walked, or sat, or\nwhatever thing he did.”  Man, ordinarily a pendant to\nevents, only half attached, and that awkwardly, to the\nworld he lives in, in these examples appears to share\nthe life of things, and to be an expression of the same\nlaws which control the tides and the sun, numbers and\nquantities.",
        "But to use a more modest illustration and nearer\nhome, I observe that in our political elections,\nwhere this element, if it appears at all, can only\noccur in its coarsest form, we sufficiently understand\nits incomparable rate. The people know that they need\nin their representative much more than talent, namely\nthe power to make his talent trusted. They cannot come\nat their ends by sending to Congress a learned, acute,\nand fluent speaker, if he be not one who, before he\nwas appointed by the people to represent them, was\nappointed by Almighty God to stand for a fact,—\ninvincibly persuaded of that fact in himself,—so\nthat the most confident and the most violent persons\nlearn that here is resistance on which both impudence\nand terror are wasted, namely faith in a fact. The men\nwho carry their points do not need to inquire of their\nconstituents what they should say, but are themselves\nthe country which they represent; nowhere are its\nemotions or opinions so instant and true as in them;\nnowhere so pure from a selfish infusion. The constituency\nat home hearkens to their words, watches the color of\ntheir cheek, and therein, as in a glass, dresses its\nown. Our public assemblies are pretty good tests of\nmanly force. Our frank countrymen of the west and south\nhave a taste for character, and like to know whether\nthe New Englander is a substantial man, or whether the\nhand can pass through him.",
        "The same motive force appears in trade. There are\ngeniuses in trade, as well as in war, or the State,\nor letters; and the reason why this or that man is\nfortunate is not to be told. It lies in the man;\nthat is all anybody can tell you about it. See him\nand you will know as easily why he succeeds, as, if\nyou see Napoleon, you would comprehend his fortune.\nIn the new objects we recognize the old game, the\nHabit of fronting the fact, and not dealing with it\nat second hand, through the perceptions of somebody\nelse.  Nature seems to authorize trade, as soon as\nyou see the natural merchant, who appears not so much\na private agent as her factor and Minister of Commerce.\nHis natural probity combines with his insight into\nthe fabric of society to put him above tricks, and he\ncommunicates to all his own faith that contracts are\nof no private interpretation. The habit of his mind is\na reference to standards of natural equity and public\nadvantage; and he inspires respect and the wish to\ndeal with him, both for the quiet spirit of honor\nwhich attends him, and for the intellectual pastime\nwhich the spectacle of so much ability affords. This\nimmensely stretched trade, which makes the capes of\nthe Southern Ocean his wharves, and the Atlantic Sea\nhis familiar port, centres in his brain only; and\nnobody in the universe can make his place good. In his\nparlor I see very well that he has been at hard work\nthis morning, with that knitted brow and that settled\nhumor, which all his desire to be courteous cannot\nshake off. I see plainly how many firm acts have been\ndone; how many valiant noes have this day been spoken,\nwhen others would have uttered ruinous yeas. I see,\nwith the pride of art and skill of masterly arithmetic\nand power of remote combination, the consciousness of\nbeing an agent and playfellow of the original laws of\nthe world. He too believes that none can supply him,\nand that a man must be born to trade or he cannot learn it.",
        "This virtue draws the mind more when it appears\nin action to ends not so mixed. It works with most\nenergy in the smallest companies and in private\nrelations. In all cases it is an extraordinary and\nincomputable agent. The excess of physical strength\nis paralyzed by it. Higher natures overpower lower\nones by affecting them with a certain sleep. The\nfaculties are locked up, and offer no resistance.\nPerhaps that is the universal law. When the high\ncannot bring up the low to itself, it benumbs it,\nas man charms down the resistance of the lower animals.\nMen exert on each other a similar occult power. How\noften has the influence of a true master realized all\nthe tales of magic! A river of command seemed to run\ndown from his eyes into all those who beheld him, a\ntorrent of strong sad light, like an Ohio or Danube,\nwhich pervaded them with his thoughts and colored all\nevents with the hue of his mind. “What means did you\nemploy?” was the question asked of the wife of Concini,\nin regard to her treatment of Mary of Medici; and the\nanswer was, “Only that influence which every strong\nmind has over a weak one.” Cannot Caesar in irons\nshuffle off the irons and transfer them to the person\nof Hippo or Thraso the turnkey? Is an iron handcuff so\nimmutable a bond? Suppose a slaver on the coast of\nGuinea should take on board a gang of negroes which\nshould contain persons of the stamp of Toussaint\nL’Ouverture: or, let us fancy, under these swarthy\nmasks he has a gang of Washingtons in chains. When\nthey arrive at Cuba, will the relative order of the\nship’s company be the same? Is there nothing but rope\nand iron? Is there no love, no reverence? Is there\nnever a glimpse of right in a poor slave-captain’s\nmind; and cannot these be supposed available to break\nor elude or in any manner overmatch the tension of an\ninch or two of iron ring?",
        "This is a natural power, like light and heat, and all\nnature cooperates with it. The reason why we feel\none man’s presence and do not feel another’s is as\nsimple as gravity. Truth is the summit of being;\njustice is the application of it to affairs. All\nindividual natures stand in a scale, according to\nthe purity of this element in them. The will of the\npure runs down from them into other natures as water\nruns down from a higher into a lower vessel. This\nnatural force is no more to be withstood than any\nother natural force.  We can drive a stone upward for\na moment into the air, but it is yet true that all\nstones will forever fall; and whatever instances can\nbe quoted of unpunished theft, or of a lie which\nsomebody credited, justice must prevail, and it is the\nprivilege of truth to make itself believed. Character\nis this moral order seen through the medium of an\nindividual nature. An individual is an encloser. Time\nand space, liberty and necessity, truth and thought,\nare left at large no longer. Now, the universe is a\nclose or pound. All things exist in the man tinged with\nthe manners of his soul. With what quality is in him he\ninfuses all nature that he can reach; nor does he tend\nto lose himself in vastness, but, at how long a curve\nsoever, all his regards return into his own good at\nlast. He animates all he can, and he sees only what he\nanimates. He encloses the world, as the patriot does his\ncountry, as a material basis for his character, and a\ntheatre for action. A healthy soul stands united with\nthe Just and the True, as the magnet arranges itself with\nthe pole; so that he stands to all beholders like a\ntransparent object betwixt them and the sun, and whoso\njourneys towards the sun, journeys towards that person.\nHe is thus the medium of the highest influence to all\nwho are not on the same level. Thus, men of character\nare the conscience of the society to which they belong.",
        "The natural measure of this power is the resistance\nof circumstances. Impure men consider life as it is\nreflected in opinions, events, and persons. They cannot\nsee the action until it is done. Yet its moral element\npreexisted in the actor, and its quality as right or\nwrong it was easy to predict. Everything in nature is\nbipolar, or has a positive and negative pole. There is\na male and a female, a spirit and a fact, a north and a\nsouth. Spirit is the positive, the event is the negative.\nWill is the north, action the south pole. Character may\nbe ranked as having its natural place in the north. It\nshares the magnetic currents of the system. The feeble\nsouls are drawn to the south or negative pole. They look\nat the profit or hurt of the action. They never behold a\nprinciple until it is lodged in a person. They do not\nwish to be lovely, but to be loved. Men of character\nlike to hear of their faults; the other class do not\nlike to hear of faults; they worship events; secure to\nthem a fact, a connection, a certain chain of circumstances,\nand they will ask no more. The hero sees that the event\nis ancillary; it must follow him. A given order of events\nhas no power to secure to him the satisfaction which the\nimagination attaches to it; the soul of goodness escapes\nfrom any set of circumstances; whilst prosperity belongs\nto a certain mind, and will introduce that power and\nvictory which is its natural fruit, into any order of\nevents. No change of circumstances can repair a defect\nof character. We boast our emancipation from many\nsuperstitions; but if we have broken any idols it is\nthrough a transfer of the idolatry. What have I gained,\nthat I no longer immolate a bull to Jove or to Neptune,\nor a mouse to Hecate; that I do not tremble before the\nEumenides, or the Catholic Purgatory, or the Calvinistic\nJudgment-day,—if I quake at opinion, the public opinion,\nas we call it; or at the threat of assault, or contumely,\nor bad neighbors, or poverty, or mutilation, or at the\nrumor of revolution, or of murder? If I quake, what matters\nit what I quake at? Our proper vice takes form in one or\nanother shape, according to the sex, age, or temperament\nof the person, and, if we are capable of fear, will readily\nfind terrors. The covetousness or the malignity which\nsaddens me when I ascribe it to society, is my own. I am\nalways environed by myself. On the other part, rectitude\nis a perpetual victory, celebrated not by cries of joy\nbut by serenity, which is joy fixed or habitual. It is\ndisgraceful to fly to events for confirmation of our truth\nand worth. The capitalist does not run every hour to the\nbroker to coin his advantages into current money of the\nrealm; he is satisfied to read in the quotations of the\nmarket that his stocks have risen. The same transport\nwhich the occurrence of the best events in the best order\nwould occasion me, I must learn to taste purer in the\nperception that my position is every hour meliorated, and\ndoes already command those events I desire. That exultation\nis only to be checked by the foresight of an order of\nthings so excellent as to throw all our prosperities into\nthe deepest shade.",
        "The face which character wears to me is self-\nsufficingness. I revere the person who is riches;\nso that I cannot think of him as alone, or poor,\nor exiled, or unhappy, or a client, but as perpetual\npatron, benefactor, and beatified man. Character is\ncentrality, the impossibility of being displaced or\noverset. A man should give us a sense of mass. Society\nis frivolous, and shreds its day into scraps, its\nconversation into ceremonies and escapes. But if I go\nto see an ingenious man I shall think myself poorly\nentertained if he give me nimble pieces of benevolence\nand etiquette; rather he shall stand stoutly in his\nplace and let me apprehend if it were only his\nresistance; know that I have encountered a new and\npositive quality;—great refreshment for both of us.\nIt is much that he does not accept the conventional\nopinions and practices. That nonconformity will remain\na goad and remembrancer, and every inquirer will have\nto dispose of him, in the first place. There is nothing\nreal or useful that is not a seat of war. Our houses\nring with laughter and personal and critical gossip,\nbut it helps little. But the uncivil, unavailable man,\nwho is a problem and a threat to society, whom it cannot\nlet pass in silence but must either worship or hate,—and\nto whom all parties feel related, both the leaders of\nopinion and the obscure and eccentric,—he helps; he\nputs America and Europe in the wrong, and destroys the\nskepticism which says, ’man is a doll, let us eat and\ndrink, ’tis the best we can do,’ by illuminating the\nuntried and unknown. Acquiescence in the establishment\nand appeal to the public, indicate infirm faith, heads\nwhich are not clear, and which must see a house built,\nbefore they can comprehend the plan of it. The wise man\nnot only leaves out of his thought the many, but leaves\nout the few. Fountains, the self-moved, the absorbed,\nthe commander because he is commanded, the assured, the\nprimary,—they are good; for these announce the instant\npresence of supreme power.",
        "Our action should rest mathematically on our\nsubstance. In nature, there are no false valuations.\nA pound of water in the ocean-tempest has no more\ngravity than in a midsummer pond. All things work\nexactly according to their quality and according to\ntheir quantity; attempt nothing they cannot do, except\nman only. He has pretension; he wishes and attempts\nthings beyond his force. I read in a book of English\nmemoirs, “Mr. Fox (afterwards Lord Holland) said, he\nmust have the Treasury; he had served up to it, and\nwould have it.” Xenophon and his Ten Thousand were\nquite equal to what they attempted, and did it; so\nequal, that it was not suspected to be a grand and\ninimitable exploit. Yet there stands that fact\nunrepeated, a high-water mark in military history.\nMany have attempted it since, and not been equal to\nit.  It is only on reality that any power of action\ncan be based. No institution will be better than the\ninstitutor.  I knew an amiable and accomplished person\nwho undertook a practical reform, yet I was never able\nto find in him the enterprise of love he took in hand.\nHe adopted it by ear and by the understanding from the\nbooks he had been reading. All his action was tentative,\na piece of the city carried out into the fields, and\nwas the city still, and no new fact, and could not\ninspire enthusiasm. Had there been something latent in\nthe man, a terrible undemonstrated genius agitating and\nembarrassing his demeanor, we had watched for its advent.\nIt is not enough that the intellect should see the evils\nand their remedy. We shall still postpone our existence,\nnor take the ground to which we are entitled, whilst it\nis only a thought and not a spirit that incites us. We\nhave not yet served up to it.",
        "These are properties of life, and another trait\nis the notice of incessant growth. Men should be\nintelligent and earnest. They must also make us\nfeel that they have a controlling happy future\nopening before them, whose early twilights already\nkindle in the passing hour. The hero is misconceived\nand misreported; he cannot therefore wait to unravel\nany man’s blunders; he is again on his road, adding\nnew powers and honors to his domain and new claims\non your heart, which will bankrupt you if you have\nloitered about the old things and have not kept your\nrelation to him by adding to your wealth. New actions\nare the only apologies and explanations of old ones\nwhich the noble can bear to offer or to receive. If\nyour friend has displeased you, you shall not sit\ndown to consider it, for he has already lost all\nmemory of the passage, and has doubled his power to\nserve you, and ere you can rise up again will burden\nyou with blessings.",
        "We have no pleasure in thinking of a benevolence\nthat is only measured by its works. Love is\ninexhaustible, and if its estate is wasted, its\ngranary emptied, still cheers and enriches, and\nthe man, though he sleep, seems to purify the air\nand his house to adorn the landscape and strengthen\nthe laws.  People always recognize this difference.\nWe know who is benevolent, by quite other means than\nthe amount of subscription to soup-societies. It is\nonly low merits that can be enumerated. Fear, when\nyour friends say to you what you have done well, and\nsay it through; but when they stand with uncertain\ntimid looks of respect and half-dislike, and must\nsuspend their judgment for years to come, you may\nbegin to hope. Those who live to the future must\nalways appear selfish to those who live to the present.\nTherefore it was droll in the good Riemer, who has\nwritten memoirs of Goethe, to make out a list of his\ndonations and good deeds, as, so many hundred thalers\ngiven to Stilling, to Hegel, to Tischbein; a lucrative\nplace found for Professor Voss, a post under the Grand\nDuke for Herder, a pension for Meyer, two professors\nrecommended to foreign universities; &c., &c. The\nlongest list of specifications of benefit would look\nvery short. A man is a poor creature if he is to be\nmeasured so. For all these of course are exceptions,\nand the rule and hodiernal life of a good man is\nbenefaction. The true charity of Goethe is to be\ninferred from the account he gave Dr. Eckermann of the\nway in which he had spent his fortune. “Each bon-mot\nof mine has cost a purse of gold. Half a million of my\nown money, the fortune I inherited, my salary and\nthe large income derived from my writings for fifty\nyears back, have been expended to instruct me in\nwhat I now know. I have besides seen,” &c.",
        "I own it is but poor chat and gossip to go to\nenumerate traits of this simple and rapid power,\nand we are painting the lightning with charcoal;\nbut in these long nights and vacations I like to\nconsole myself so.  Nothing but itself can copy\nit. A word warm from the heart enriches me. I\nsurrender at discretion. How death-cold is literary\ngenius before this fire of life! These are the\ntouches that reanimate my heavy soul and give it\neyes to pierce the dark of nature. I find, where I\nthought myself poor, there was I most rich.  Thence\ncomes a new intellectual exaltation, to be again\nrebuked by some new exhibition of character.\nStrange alternation of attraction and repulsion!\nCharacter repudiates intellect, yet excites it; and\ncharacter passes into thought, is published so, and\nthen is ashamed before new flashes of moral worth.",
        "Character is nature in the highest form. It is of no\nuse to ape it or to contend with it. Somewhat is\npossible of resistance, and of persistence, and of\ncreation, to this power, which will foil all emulation.",
        "This masterpiece is best where no hands but nature’s\nhave been laid on it. Care is taken that the greatly-\ndestined shall slip up into life in the shade, with no\nthousand-eyed Athens to watch and blazon every new\nthought, every blushing emotion of young genius. Two\npersons lately, very young children of the most high\nGod, have given me occasion for thought. When I explored\nthe source of their sanctity and charm for the imagination,\nit seemed as if each answered, ’From my nonconformity; I\nnever listened to your people’s law, or to what they call\ntheir gospel, and wasted my time. I was content with the\nsimple rural poverty of my own; hence this sweetness; my\nwork never reminds you of that;—is pure of that.’ And\nnature advertises me in such persons that in democratic\nAmerica she will not be democratized. How cloistered and\nconstitutionally sequestered from the market and from\nscandal! It was only this morning that I sent away some\nwild flowers of these wood-gods. They are a relief from\nliterature,—these fresh draughts from the sources of\nthought and sentiment; as we read, in an age of polish\nand criticism, the first lines of written prose and verse\nof a nation. How captivating is their devotion to their\nfavorite books, whether Aeschylus, Dante, Shakspeare, or\nScott, as feeling that they have a stake in that book;\nwho touches that, touches them;—and especially the total\nsolitude of the critic, the Patmos of thought from which\nhe writes, in unconsciousness of any eyes that shall ever\nread this writing. Could they dream on still, as angels,\nand not wake to comparisons, and to be flattered! Yet some\nnatures are too good to be spoiled by praise, and wherever\nthe vein of thought reaches down into the profound, there\nis no danger from vanity. Solemn friends will warn them of\nthe danger of the head’s being turned by the flourish of\ntrumpets, but they can afford to smile. I remember the\nindignation of an eloquent Methodist at the kind admonitions\nof a Doctor of Divinity,—’My friend, a man can neither be\npraised nor insulted.’ But forgive the counsels; they are\nvery natural. I remember the thought which occurred to me\nwhen some ingenious and spiritual foreigners came to\nAmerica, was, Have you been victimized in being brought\nhither?—or, prior to that, answer me this, ’Are you\nvictimizable?’",
        "As I have said, Nature keeps these sovereignties\nin her own hands, and however pertly our sermons\nand disciplines would divide some share of credit,\nand teach that the laws fashion the citizen, she\ngoes her own gait and puts the wisest in the wrong.\nShe makes very light of gospels and prophets, as\none who has a great many more to produce and no\nexcess of time to spare on any one. There is a class\nof men, individuals of which appear at long intervals,\nso eminently endowed with insight and virtue that\nthey have been unanimously saluted as divine, and who\nseem to be an accumulation of that power we consider.\nDivine persons are character born, or, to borrow a\nphrase from Napoleon, they are victory organized.\nThey are usually received with ill-will, because they\nare new and because they set a bound to the exaggeration\nthat has been made of the personality of the last divine\nperson. Nature never rhymes her children, nor makes two\nmen alike. When we see a great man we fancy a resemblance\nto some historical person, and predict the sequel of his\ncharacter and fortune; a result which he is sure to\ndisappoint. None will ever solve the problem of his\ncharacter according to our prejudice, but only in his\nown high unprecedented way. Character wants room; must\nnot be crowded on by persons nor be judged from glimpses\ngot in the press of affairs or on few occasions. It\nneeds perspective, as a great building. It may not,\nprobably does not, form relations rapidly; and we should\nnot require rash explanation, either on the popular\nethics, or on our own, of its action.",
        "I look on Sculpture as history. I do not think the\nApollo and the Jove impossible in flesh and blood.\nEvery trait which the artist recorded in stone he\nhad seen in life, and better than his copy. We have\nseen many counterfeits, but we are born believers in\ngreat men. How easily we read in old books, when men\nwere few, of the smallest action of the patriarchs.\nWe require that a man should be so large and columnar\nin the landscape, that it should deserve to be\nrecorded that he arose, and girded up his loins, and\ndeparted to such a place. The most credible pictures\nare those of majestic men who prevailed at their\nentrance, and convinced the senses; as happened to\nthe eastern magian who was sent to test the merits\nof Zertusht or Zoroaster. When the Yunani sage arrived\nat Balkh, the Persians tell us, Gushtasp appointed a\nday on which the Mobeds of every country should\nassemble, and a golden chair was placed for the Yunani\nsage.  Then the beloved of Yezdam, the prophet Zertusht,\nadvanced into the midst of the assembly. The Yunani\nsage, on seeing that chief, said, “This form and this\ngait cannot lie, and nothing but truth can proceed\nfrom them.” Plato said it was impossible not to\nbelieve in the children of the gods, “though they\nshould speak without probable or necessary arguments.\"\nI should think myself very unhappy in my associates if\nI could not credit the best things in history. “John\nBradshaw,” says Milton, “appears like a consul, from\nwhom the fasces are not to depart with the year; so\nthat not on the tribunal only, but throughout his life,\nyou would regard him as sitting in judgment upon kings.\"\nI find it more credible, since it is anterior information,\nthat one man should know heaven, as the Chinese say, than\nthat so many men should know the world. “The virtuous\nprince confronts the gods, without any misgiving. He\nwaits a hundred ages till a sage comes, and does not\ndoubt. He who confronts the gods, without any misgiving,\nknows heaven; he who waits a hundred ages until a sage\ncomes, without doubting, knows men. Hence the virtuous\nprince moves, and for ages shows empire the way.” But\nthere is no need to seek remote examples. He is a dull\nobserver whose experience has not taught him the reality\nand force of magic, as well as of chemistry.  The coldest\nprecisian cannot go abroad without encountering\ninexplicable influences. One man fastens an eye on him\nand the graves of the memory render up their dead; the\nsecrets that make him wretched either to keep or to\nbetray must be yielded;—another, and he cannot speak,\nand the bones of his body seem to lose their cartilages;\nthe entrance of a friend adds grace, boldness, and\neloquence to him; and there are persons he cannot choose\nbut remember, who gave a transcendent expansion to his\nthought, and kindled another life in his bosom.",
        "What is so excellent as strict relations of amity,\nwhen they spring from this deep root? The sufficient\nreply to the skeptic who doubts the power and the\nfurniture of man, is in that possibility of joyful\nintercourse with persons, which makes the faith and\npractice of all reasonable men. I know nothing which\nlife has to offer so satisfying as the profound good\nunderstanding which can subsist after much exchange of\ngood offices, between two virtuous men, each of whom\nis sure of himself and sure of his friend. It is a\nhappiness which postpones all other gratifications,\nand makes politics, and commerce, and churches, cheap.\nFor when men shall meet as they ought, each a benefactor,\na shower of stars, clothed with thoughts, with deeds,\nwith accomplishments, it should be the festival of\nnature which all things announce. Of such friendship,\nlove in the sexes is the first symbol, as all other\nthings are symbols of love. Those relations to the best\nmen, which, at one time, we reckoned the romances of\nyouth, become, in the progress of the character, the\nmost solid enjoyment.",
        "If it were possible to live in right relations with\nmen!—if we could abstain from asking anything of\nthem, from asking their praise, or help, or pity,\nand content us with compelling them through the\nvirtue of the eldest laws! Could we not deal with\na few persons,—with one person,—after the unwritten\nstatutes, and make an experiment of their efficacy?\nCould we not pay our friend the compliment of truth,\nof silence, of forbearing? Need we be so eager to\nseek him? If we are related, we shall meet. It was a\ntradition of the ancient world that no metamorphosis\ncould hide a god from a god; and there is a Greek\nverse which runs,—",
        "Friends also follow the laws of divine necessity;\nthey gravitate to each other, and cannot otherwise:—",
        "Their relation is not made, but allowed. The gods\nmust seat themselves without seneschal in our\nOlympus, and as they can instal themselves by\nseniority divine. Society is spoiled if pains are\ntaken, if the associates are brought a mile to meet.\nAnd if it be not society, it is a mischievous, low,\ndegrading jangle, though made up of the best. All the\ngreatness of each is kept back and every foible in\npainful activity, as if the Olympians should meet to\nexchange snuff-boxes.",
        "Life goes headlong. We chase some flying scheme, or\nwe are hunted by some fear or command behind us. But\nif suddenly we encounter a friend, we pause; our heat\nand hurry look foolish enough; now pause, now possession\nis required, and the power to swell the moment from the\nresources of the heart. The moment is all, in all noble\nrelations.",
        "A divine person is the prophecy of the mind; a\nfriend is the hope of the heart. Our beatitude\nwaits for the fulfilment of these two in one. The\nages are opening this moral force. All force is\nthe shadow or symbol of that. Poetry is joyful\nand strong as it draws its inspiration thence. Men\nwrite their names on the world as they are filled\nwith this. History has been mean; our nations have\nbeen mobs; we have never seen a man: that divine\nform we do not yet know, but only the dream and\nprophecy of such: we do not know the majestic manners\nwhich belong to him, which appease and exalt the\nbeholder. We shall one day see that the most private\nis the most public energy, that quality atones for\nquantity, and grandeur of character acts in the dark,\nand succors them who never saw it. What greatness has\nyet appeared is beginnings and encouragements to us\nin this direction. The history of those gods and saints\nwhich the world has written and then worshipped, are\ndocuments of character. The ages have exulted in the\nmanners of a youth who owed nothing to fortune, and\nwho was hanged at the Tyburn of his nation, who, by\nthe pure quality of his nature, shed an epic splendor\naround the facts of his death which has transfigured\nevery particular into an universal symbol for the\neyes of mankind. This great defeat is hitherto our\nhighest fact. But the mind requires a victory to the\nsenses; a force of character which will convert judge,\njury, soldier, and king; which will rule animal and\nmineral virtues, and blend with the courses of sap,\nof rivers, of winds, of stars, and of moral agents.",
        "If we cannot attain at a bound to these grandeurs,\nat least let us do them homage. In society, high\nadvantages are set down to the possessor as\ndisadvantages. It requires the more wariness in\nour private estimates. I do not forgive in my\nfriends the failure to know a fine character and\nto entertain it with thankful hospitality. When\nat last that which we have always longed for is\narrived and shines on us with glad rays out of\nthat far celestial land, then to be coarse, then\nto be critical and treat such a visitant with the\njabber and suspicion of the streets, argues a\nvulgarity that seems to shut the doors of heaven.\nThis is confusion, this the right insanity, when\nthe soul no longer knows its own, nor where its\nallegiance, its religion, are due. Is there any\nreligion but this, to know that wherever in the\nwide desert of being the holy sentiment we cherish\nhas opened into a flower, it blooms for me? if none\nsees it, I see it; I am aware, if I alone, of the\ngreatness of the fact. Whilst it blooms, I will\nkeep sabbath or holy time, and suspend my gloom\nand my folly and jokes. Nature is indulged by the\npresence of this guest. There are many eyes that\ncan detect and honor the prudent and household\nvirtues; there are many that can discern Genius on\nhis starry track, though the mob is incapable; but\nwhen that love which is all-suffering, all-abstaining,\nall-aspiring, which has vowed to itself that it will\nbe a wretch and also a fool in this world sooner than\nsoil its white hands by any compliances, comes into\nour streets and houses,—only the pure and aspiring\ncan know its face, and the only compliment they can\npay it is to own it.",
        "HALF the world, it is said, knows not how the other\nhalf live. Our Exploring Expedition saw the Feejee\nislanders getting their dinner off human bones; and\nthey are said to eat their own wives and children.\nThe husbandry of the modern inhabitants of Gournou\n(west of old Thebes) is philosophical to a fault. To\nset up their housekeeping nothing is requisite but\ntwo or three earthen pots, a stone to grind meal, and\na mat which is the bed. The house, namely a tomb, is\nready without rent or taxes. No rain can pass through\nthe roof, and there is no door, for there is no want\nof one, as there is nothing to lose. If the house do\nnot please them, they walk out and enter another, as\nthere are several hundreds at their command. “It is\nsomewhat singular,” adds Belzoni, to whom we owe this\naccount, “to talk of happiness among people who live\nin sepulchres, among the corpses and rags of an ancient\nnation which they know nothing of.” In the deserts of\nBorgoo the rock-Tibboos still dwell in caves, like\ncliff-swallows, and the language of these negroes is\ncompared by their neighbors to the shrieking of bats\nand to the whistling of birds. Again, the Bornoos have\nno proper names; individuals are called after their\nheight, thickness, or other accidental quality, and\nhave nicknames merely. But the salt, the dates, the\nivory, and the gold, for which these horrible regions\nare visited, find their way into countries where the\npurchaser and consumer can hardly be ranked in one\nrace with these cannibals and man-stealers; countries\nwhere man serves himself with metals, wood, stone,\nglass, gum, cotton, silk, and wool; honors himself with\narchitecture; writes laws, and contrives to execute his\nwill through the hands of many nations; and, especially,\nestablishes a select society, running through all the\ncountries of intelligent men, a self-constituted\naristocracy, or fraternity of the best, which, without\nwritten law or exact usage of any kind, perpetuates\nitself, colonizes every new-planted island and adopts\nand makes its own whatever personal beauty or extraordinary\nnative endowment anywhere appears.",
        "What fact more conspicuous in modern history than\nthe creation of the gentleman? Chivalry is that,\nand loyalty is that, and, in English literature,\nhalf the drama, and all the novels, from Sir Philip\nSidney to Sir Walter Scott, paint this figure. The\nword gentleman, which, like the word Christian, must\nhereafter characterize the present and the few\npreceding centuries by the importance attached to\nit, is a homage to personal and incommunicable\nproperties. Frivolous and fantastic additions have\ngot associated with the name, but the steady interest\nof mankind in it must be attributed to the valuable\nproperties which it designates. An element which\nunites all the most forcible persons of every\ncountry; makes them intelligible and agreeable to\neach other, and is somewhat so precise that it is\nat once felt if an individual lack the masonic sign,—\ncannot be any casual product, but must be an average\nresult of the character and faculties universally\nfound in men. It seems a certain permanent average;\nas the atmosphere is a permanent composition, whilst\nso many gases are combined only to be decompounded.\nComme il faut, is the Frenchman’s description of good\nSociety: as we must be. It is a spontaneous fruit of\ntalents and feelings of precisely that class who have\nmost vigor, who take the lead in the world of this\nhour, and though far from pure, far from constituting\nthe gladdest and highest tone of human feeling, is as\ngood as the whole society permits it to be. It is made\nof the spirit, more than of the talent of men, and is\na compound result into which every great force enters\nas an ingredient, namely virtue, wit, beauty, wealth,\nand power.",
        "There is something equivocal in all the words in\nuse to express the excellence of manners and social\ncultivation, because the quantities are fluxional,\nand the last effect is assumed by the senses as the\ncause.  The word gentleman has not any correlative\nabstract to express the quality. Gentility is mean,\nand gentilesse is obsolete. But we must keep alive\nin the vernacular the distinction between fashion,\na word of narrow and often sinister meaning, and the\nheroic character which the gentleman imports. The\nusual words, however, must be respected; they will\nbe found to contain the root of the matter. The point\nof distinction in all this class of names, as courtesy,\nchivalry, fashion, and the like, is that the flower\nand fruit, not the grain of the tree, are contemplated.\nIt is beauty which is the aim this time, and not worth.\nThe result is now in question, although our words\nintimate well enough the popular feeling that the\nappearance supposes a substance. The gentleman is a\nman of truth, lord of his own actions, and expressing\nthat lordship in his behavior, not in any manner\ndependent and servile, either on persons, or opinions,\nor possessions. Beyond this fact of truth and real\nforce, the word denotes good-nature or benevolence:\nmanhood first, and then gentleness. The popular notion\ncertainly adds a condition of ease and fortune; but\nthat is a natural result of personal force and love,\nthat they should possess and dispense the goods of the\nworld. In times of violence, every eminent person must\nfall in with many opportunities to approve his stoutness\nand worth; therefore every man’s name that emerged at\nall from the mass in the feudal ages, rattles in our\near like a flourish of trumpets. But personal force\nnever goes out of fashion.  That is still paramount\nto-day, and in the moving crowd of good society the\nmen of valor and reality are known and rise to their\nnatural place. The competition is transferred from war\nto politics and trade, but the personal force appears\nreadily enough in these new arenas.",
        "Power first, or no leading class. In politics and\nin trade, bruisers and pirates are of better promise\nthan talkers and clerks. God knows that all sorts of\ngentlemen knock at the door; but whenever used in\nstrictness and with any emphasis, the name will be\nfound to point at original energy. It describes a man\nstanding in his own right and working after untaught\nmethods. In a good lord there must first be a good\nanimal, at least to the extent of yielding the\nincomparable advantage of animal spirits. The ruling\nclass must have more, but they must have these, giving\nin every company the sense of power, which makes things\neasy to be done which daunt the wise. The society of\nthe energetic class, in their friendly and festive\nmeetings, is full of courage and of attempts which\nintimidate the pale scholar. The courage which girls\nexhibit is like a battle of Lundy’s Lane, or a sea-\nfight. The intellect relies on memory to make some\nsupplies to face these extemporaneous squadrons. But\nmemory is a base mendicant with basket and badge, in\nthe presence of these sudden masters. The rulers of\nsociety must be up to the work of the world, and equal\nto their versatile office: men of the right Caesarian\npattern, who have great range of affinity. I am far\nfrom believing the timid maxim of Lord Falkland (\"that\nfor ceremony there must go two to it; since a bold\nfellow will go through the cunningest forms”), and am\nof opinion that the gentleman is the bold fellow whose\nforms are not to be broken through; and only that\nplenteous nature is rightful master which is the\ncomplement of whatever person it converses with. My\ngentleman gives the law where he is; he will outpray\nsaints in chapel, outgeneral veterans in the field, and\noutshine all courtesy in the hall. He is good company\nfor pirates and good with academicians; so that it is\nuseless to fortify yourself against him; he has the\nprivate entrance to all minds, and I could as easily\nexclude myself, as him. The famous gentlemen of Asia\nand Europe have been of this strong type; Saladin, Sapor,\nthe Cid, Julius Caesar, Scipio, Alexander, Pericles, and\nthe lordliest personages. They sat very carelessly in\ntheir chairs, and were too excellent themselves, to value\nany condition at a high rate.",
        "A plentiful fortune is reckoned necessary, in the\npopular judgment, to the completion of this man of\nthe world; and it is a material deputy which walks\nthrough the dance which the first has led. Money is\nnot essential, but this wide affinity is, which\ntranscends the habits of clique and caste and makes\nitself felt by men of all classes. If the aristocrat\nis only valid in fashionable circles and not with\ntruckmen, he will never be a leader in fashion; and\nif the man of the people cannot speak on equal terms\nwith the gentleman, so that the gentleman shall\nperceive that he is already really of his own order,\nhe is not to be feared. Diogenes, Socrates, and\nEpaminondas, are gentlemen of the best blood who have\nchosen the condition of poverty when that of wealth\nwas equally open to them. I use these old names, but\nthe men I speak of are my contemporaries. Fortune will\nnot supply to every generation one of these well-\nappointed knights, but every collection of men furnishes\nsome example of the class; and the politics of this\ncountry, and the trade of every town, are controlled by\nthese hardy and irresponsible doers, who have invention\nto take the lead, and a broad sympathy which puts them\nin fellowship with crowds, and makes their action\npopular.",
        "The manners of this class are observed and caught\nwith devotion by men of taste. The association of\nthese masters with each other and with men intelligent\nof their merits, is mutually agreeable and stimulating.\nThe good forms, the happiest expressions of each, are\nrepeated and adopted. By swift consent everything\nsuperfluous is dropped, everything graceful is renewed.\nFine manners show themselves formidable to the\nuncultivated man. They are a subtler science of defence\nto parry and intimidate; but once matched by the skill\nof the other party, they drop the point of the sword,\n—points and fences disappear, and the youth finds\nhimself in a more transparent atmosphere, wherein life\nis a less troublesome game, and not a misunderstanding\nrises between the players. Manners aim to facilitate\nlife, to get rid of impediments and bring the man pure\nto energize. They aid our dealing and conversation as a\nrailway aids travelling, by getting rid of all avoidable\nobstructions of the road and leaving nothing to be\nconquered but pure space. These forms very soon become\nfixed, and a fine sense of propriety is cultivated with\nthe more heed that it becomes a badge of social and\ncivil distinctions. Thus grows up Fashion, an equivocal\nsemblance, the most puissant, the most fantastic and\nfrivolous, the most feared and followed, and which morals\nand violence assault in vain.",
        "There exists a strict relation between the class\nof power and the exclusive and polished circles.\nThe last are always filled or filling from the\nfirst. The strong men usually give some allowance\neven to the petulances of fashion, for that affinity\nthey find in it. Napoleon, child of the revolution,\ndestroyer of the old noblesse, never ceased to court\nthe Faubourg St. Germain; doubtless with the feeling\nthat fashion is a homage to men of his stamp. Fashion,\nthough in a strange way, represents all manly virtue.\nIt is virtue gone to seed: it is a kind of posthumous\nhonor. It does not often caress the great, but the\nchildren of the great: it is a hall of the Past. It\nusually sets its face against the great of this hour.\nGreat men are not commonly in its halls; they are\nabsent in the field: they are working, not triumphing.\nFashion is made up of their children; of those who\nthrough the value and virtue of somebody, have acquired\nlustre to their name, marks of distinction, means of\ncultivation and generosity, and, in their physical\norganization a certain health and excellence which\nsecures to them, if not the highest power to work, yet\nhigh power to enjoy. The class of power, the working\nheroes, the Cortez, the Nelson, the Napoleon, see that\nthis is the festivity and permanent celebration of such\nas they; that fashion is funded talent; is Mexico,\nMarengo, and Trafalgar beaten out thin; that the\nbrilliant names of fashion run back to just such busy\nnames as their own, fifty or sixty years ago. They are\nthe sowers, their sons shall be the reapers, and their\nsons, in the ordinary course of things, must yield the\npossession of the harvest to new competitors with keener\neyes and stronger frames. The city is recruited from the\ncountry. In the year 1805, it is said, every legitimate\nmonarch in Europe was imbecile. The city would have died\nout, rotted, and exploded, long ago, but that it was\nreinforced from the fields. It is only country which\ncame to town day before yesterday that is city and court\ntoday.",
        "Aristocracy and fashion are certain inevitable\nresults. These mutual selections are indestructible.\nIf they provoke anger in the least favored class,\nand the excluded majority revenge themselves on the\nexcluding minority by the strong hand and kill them,\nat once a new class finds itself at the top, as\ncertainly as cream rises in a bowl of milk: and if\nthe people should destroy class after class, until\ntwo men only were left, one of these would be the\nleader and would be involuntarily served and copied\nby the other. You may keep this minority out of sight\nand out of mind, but it is tenacious of life, and is\none of the estates of the realm. I am the more struck\nwith this tenacity, when I see its work. It respects\nthe administration of such unimportant matters, that\nwe should not look for any durability in its rule. We\nsometimes meet men under some strong moral influence,\nas a patriotic, a literary, a religious movement, and\nfeel that the moral sentiment rules man and nature.\nWe think all other distinctions and ties will be slight\nand fugitive, this of caste or fashion for example;\nyet come from year to year and see how permanent that\nis, in this Boston or New York life of man, where too\nit has not the least countenance from the law of the\nland.  Not in Egypt or in India a firmer or more\nimpassable line. Here are associations whose ties go\nover and under and through it, a meeting of merchants,\na military corps, a college class, a fire-club, a\nprofessional association, a political, a religious\nconvention;—the persons seem to draw inseparably near;\nyet, that assembly once dispersed, its members will not\nin the year meet again. Each returns to his degree in\nthe scale of good society, porcelain remains porcelain,\nand earthen earthen. The objects of fashion may be\nfrivolous, or fashion may be objectless, but the nature\nof this union and selection can be neither frivolous\nnor accidental. Each man’s rank in that perfect\ngraduation depends on some symmetry in his structure or\nsome agreement in his structure to the symmetry of society.\nIts doors unbar instantaneously to a natural claim of\ntheir own kind. A natural gentleman finds his way in, and\nwill keep the oldest patrician out who has lost his\nintrinsic rank. Fashion understands itself; good-breeding\nand personal superiority of whatever country readily\nfraternize with those of every other. The chiefs of savage\ntribes have distinguished themselves in London and Paris,\nby the purity of their tournure.",
        "To say what good of fashion we can, it rests on\nreality, and hates nothing so much as pretenders;\nto exclude and mystify pretenders and send them\ninto everlasting ’Coventry,’ is its delight. We\ncontemn in turn every other gift of men of the\nworld; but the habit even in little and the least\nmatters of not appealing to any but our own sense\nof propriety, constitutes the foundation of all\nchivalry. There is almost no kind of self-reliance,\nso it be sane and proportioned, which fashion does\nnot occasionally adopt and give it the freedom of\nits saloons. A sainted soul is always elegant, and,\nif it will, passes unchallenged into the most guarded\nring. But so will Jock the teamster pass, in some\ncrisis that brings him thither, and find favor, as\nlong as his head is not giddy with the new circumstance,\nand the iron shoes do not wish to dance in waltzes and\ncotillons. For there is nothing settled in manners,\nbut the laws of behavior yield to the energy of the\nindividual. The maiden at her first ball, the country-\nman at a city dinner, believes that there is a ritual\naccording to which every act and compliment must be\nperformed, or the failing party must be cast out of\nthis presence. Later they learn that good sense and\ncharacter make their own forms every moment, and speak\nor abstain, take wine or refuse it, stay or go, sit in\na chair or sprawl with children on the floor, or stand\non their head, or what else soever, in a new and\naboriginal way; and that strong will is always in fashion,\nlet who will be unfashionable. All that fashion demands\nis composure and self-content. A circle of men perfectly\nwell-bred would be a company of sensible persons in which\nevery man’s native manners and character appeared. If the\nfashionist have not this quality, he is nothing. We are\nsuch lovers of self-reliance that we excuse in a man many\nsins if he will show us a complete satisfaction in his\nposition, which asks no leave to be, of mine, or any\nman’s good opinion. But any deference to some eminent\nman or woman of the world, forfeits all privilege of\nnobility.  He is an underling: I have nothing to do with\nhim; I will speak with his master. A man should not go\nwhere he cannot carry his whole sphere or society with\nhim,—not bodily, the whole circle of his friends, but\natmospherically. He should preserve in a new company the\nsame attitude of mind and reality of relation which his\ndaily associates draw him to, else he is shorn of his\nbest beams, and will be an orphan in the merriest club.\n\"If you could see Vich Ian Vohr with his tail on!—” But\nVich Ian Vohr must always carry his belongings in some\nfashion, if not added as honor, then severed as disgrace.",
        "There will always be in society certain persons who\nare mercuries of its approbation, and whose glance\nwill at any time determine for the curious their\nstanding in the world. These are the chamberlains of\nthe lesser gods. Accept their coldness as an omen of\ngrace with the loftier deities, and allow them all their\nprivilege. They are clear in their office, nor could\nthey be thus formidable without their own merits. But\ndo not measure the importance of this class by their\npretension, or imagine that a fop can be the dispenser\nof honor and shame. They pass also at their just rate;\nfor how can they otherwise, in circles which exist as\na sort of herald’s office for the sifting of character?",
        "As the first thing man requires of man is reality,\nso that appears in all the forms of society. We\npointedly, and by name, introduce the parties to\neach other. Know you before all heaven and earth,\nthat this is Andrew, and this is Gregory,—they\nlook each other in the eye; they grasp each other’s\nhand, to identify and signalize each other. It is a\ngreat satisfaction. A gentleman never dodges; his\neyes look straight forward, and he assures the other\nparty, first of all, that he has been met. For what\nis it that we seek, in so many visits and hospitalities?\nIs it your draperies, pictures, and decorations? Or do\nwe not insatiably ask, Was a man in the house? I may\neasily go into a great household where there is much\nsubstance, excellent provision for comfort, luxury,\nand taste, and yet not encounter there any Amphitryon\nwho shall subordinate these appendages. I may go into\na cottage, and find a farmer who feels that he is the\nman I have come to see, and fronts me accordingly. It\nwas therefore a very natural point of old feudal\netiquette that a gentleman who received a visit,\nthough it were of his sovereign, should not leave his\nroof, but should wait his arrival at the door of his\nhouse. No house, though it were the Tuileries or the\nEscurial, is good for anything without a master. And\nyet we are not often gratified by this hospitality.\nEvery body we know surrounds himself with a fine house,\nfine books, conservatory, gardens, equipage and all\nmanner of toys, as screens to interpose between himself\nand his guest. Does it not seem as if man was of a very\nsly, elusive nature, and dreaded nothing so much as a\nfull rencontre front to front with his fellow? It were\nunmerciful, I know, quite to abolish the use of these\nscreens, which are of eminent convenience, whether the\nguest is too great or too little. We call together many\nfriends who keep each other in play, or by luxuries and\nornaments we amuse the young people, and guard our\nretirement. Or if perchance a searching realist comes\nto our gate, before whose eye we have no care to stand,\nthen again we run to our curtain, and hide ourselves as\nAdam at the voice of the Lord God in the garden. Cardinal\nCaprara, the Pope’s legate at Paris, defended himself\nfrom the glances of Napoleon by an immense pair of green\nspectacles. Napoleon remarked them, and speedily managed\nto rally them off: and yet Napoleon, in his turn, was not\ngreat enough with eight hundred thousand troops at his\nback, to face a pair of freeborn eyes, but fenced himself\nwith etiquette and within triple barriers of reserve; and,\nas all the world knows from Madame de Stael, was wont,\nwhen he found himself observed, to discharge his face of\nall expression. But emperors and rich men are by no means\nthe most skilful masters of good manners. No rentroll nor\narmy-list can dignify skulking and dissimulation; and the\nfirst point of courtesy must always be truth, as really\nall the forms of good-breeding point that way.",
        "I have just been reading, in Mr. Hazlitt’s translation,\nMontaigne’s account of his journey into Italy, and am\nstruck with nothing more agreeably than the self-\nrespecting fashions of the time. His arrival in each\nplace, the arrival of a gentleman of France, is an event\nof some consequence. Wherever he goes he pays a visit\nto whatever prince or gentleman of note resides upon his\nroad, as a duty to himself and to civilization.  When he\nleaves any house in which he has lodged for a few weeks,\nhe causes his arms to be painted and hung up as a\nperpetual sign to the house, as was the custom of gentlemen.",
        "The complement of this graceful self-respect, and\nthat of all the points of good breeding I most require\nand insist upon, is deference. I like that every chair\nshould be a throne, and hold a king. I prefer a tendency\nto stateliness to an excess of fellowship. Let the\nincommunicable objects of nature and the metaphysical\nisolation of man teach us independence. Let us not be\ntoo much acquainted. I would have a man enter his house\nthrough a hall filled with heroic and sacred sculptures,\nthat he might not want the hint of tranquillity and\nself-poise. We should meet each morning as from foreign\ncountries, and, spending the day together, should depart\nat night, as into foreign countries. In all things I\nwould have the island of a man inviolate. Let us sit\napart as the gods, talking from peak to peak all round\nOlympus. No degree of affection need invade this religion.\nThis is myrrh and rosemary to keep the other sweet. Lovers\nShould guard their strangeness. If they forgive too much,\nall slides into confusion and meanness. It is easy to\npush this deference to a Chinese etiquette; but coolness\nand absence of heat and haste indicate fine qualities. A\ngentleman makes no noise; a lady is serene. Proportionate\nis our disgust at those invaders who fill a studious\nhouse with blast and running, to secure some paltry\nconvenience. Not less I dislike a low sympathy of each with\nhis neighbor’s needs. Must we have a good understanding\nwith one another’s palates? as foolish people who have\nlived long together know when each wants salt or sugar.\nI pray my companion, if he wishes for bread, to ask me\nfor bread, and if he wishes for sassafras or arsenic, to\nask me for them, and not to hold out his plate as if I\nknew already. Every natural function can be dignified by\ndeliberation and privacy. Let us leave hurry to slaves.\nThe compliments and ceremonies of our breeding should\nsignify, however remotely, the recollection of the grandeur\nof our destiny.",
        "The flower of courtesy does not very well bide\nhandling, but if we dare to open another leaf and\nexplore what parts go to its conformation, we shall\nfind also an intellectual quality. To the leaders\nof men, the brain as well as the flesh and the heart\nmust furnish a proportion. Defect in manners is\nusually the defect of fine perceptions. Men are too\ncoarsely made for the delicacy of beautiful carriage\nand customs. It is not quite sufficient to good-\nbreeding, a union of kindness and independence. We\nimperatively require a perception of, and a homage\nto beauty in our companions. Other virtues are in\nrequest in the field and workyard, but a certain\ndegree of taste is not to be spared in those we sit\nwith. I could better eat with one who did not respect\nthe truth or the laws than with a sloven and\nunpresentable person. Moral qualities rule the world,\nbut at short distances the senses are despotic. The\nsame discrimination of fit and fair runs out, if with\nless rigor, into all parts of life. The average spirit\nof the energetic class is good sense, acting under\ncertain limitations and to certain ends. It entertains\nevery natural gift. Social in its nature, it respects\neverything which tends to unite men. It delights in\nmeasure. The love of beauty is mainly the love of\nmeasure or proportion. The person who screams, or uses\nthe superlative degree, or converses with heat, puts\nwhole drawing-rooms to flight. If you wish to be loved,\nlove measure. You must have genius or a prodigious\nusefulness if you will hide the want of measure. This\nperception comes in to polish and perfect the parts of\nthe social instrument. Society will pardon much to\ngenius and special gifts, but, being in its nature a\nconvention, it loves what is conventional, or what\nbelongs to coming together. That makes the good and bad\nof manners, namely what helps or hinders fellowship.\nFor fashion is not good sense absolute, but relative;\nnot good sense private, but good sense entertaining\ncompany. It hates corners and sharp points of character,\nhates quarrelsome, egotistical, solitary, and gloomy\npeople; hates whatever can interfere with total blending\nof parties; whilst it values all peculiarities as in the\nhighest degree refreshing, which can consist with good\nfellowship. And besides the general infusion of wit to\nheighten civility, the direct splendor of intellectual\npower is ever welcome in fine society as the costliest\naddition to its rule and its credit.",
        "The dry light must shine in to adorn our festival,\nbut it must be tempered and shaded, or that will\nalso offend. Accuracy is essential to beauty, and\nquick perceptions to politeness, but not too quick\nperceptions. One may be too punctual and too precise.\nHe must leave the omniscience of business at the\ndoor, when he comes into the palace of beauty. Society\nloves creole natures, and sleepy languishing manners,\nso that they cover sense, grace and good-will: the air\nof drowsy strength, which disarms criticism; perhaps\nbecause such a person seems to reserve himself for the\nbest of the game, and not spend himself on surfaces;\nan ignoring eye, which does not see the annoyances,\nshifts, and inconveniences that cloud the brow and\nsmother the voice of the sensitive.",
        "Therefore besides personal force and so much\nperception as constitutes unerring taste, society\ndemands in its patrician class another element\nalready intimated, which it significantly terms\ngood-nature,—expressing all degrees of generosity,\nfrom the lowest willingness and faculty to oblige,\nup to the heights of magnanimity and love. Insight\nwe must have, or we shall run against one another\nand miss the way to our food; but intellect is\nselfish and barren. The secret of success in society\nis a certain heartiness and sympathy. A man who is\nnot happy in the company cannot find any word in his\nmemory that will fit the occasion. All his information\nis a little impertinent. A man who is happy there,\nfinds in every turn of the conversation equally lucky\noccasions for the introduction of that which he has\nto say. The favorites of society, and what it calls\nwhole souls, are able men and of more spirit than wit,\nwho have no uncomfortable egotism, but who exactly\nfill the hour and the company; contented and contenting,\nat a marriage or a funeral, a ball or a jury, a water-\nparty or a shooting-match. England, which is rich in\ngentlemen, furnished, in the beginning of the present\ncentury, a good model of that genius which the world\nloves, in Mr. Fox, who added to his great abilities\nthe most social disposition and real love of men.\nParliamentary history has few better passages than the\ndebate in which Burke and Fox separated in the House\nof Commons; when Fox urged on his old friend the claims\nof old friendship with such tenderness that the house\nwas moved to tears. Another anecdote is so close to my\nmatter, that I must hazard the story. A tradesman who\nhad long dunned him for a note of three hundred guineas,\nfound him one day counting gold, and demanded payment:\n—\"No,” said Fox, “I owe this money to Sheridan; it is\na debt of honor; if an accident should happen to me,\nhe has nothing to show.” “Then,” said the creditor, “I\nchange my debt into a debt of honor,” and tore the note\nin pieces. Fox thanked the man for his confidence and\npaid him, saying, “his debt was of older standing, and\nSheridan must wait.” Lover of liberty, friend of the\nHindoo, friend of the African slave, he possessed a\ngreat personal popularity; and Napoleon said of him on\nthe occasion of his visit to Paris, in 1805, “Mr. Fox\nwill always hold the first place in an assembly at\nthe Tuileries.”",
        "We may easily seem ridiculous in our eulogy of\ncourtesy, whenever we insist on benevolence as its\nfoundation. The painted phantasm Fashion rises to\ncast a species of derision on what we say. But I\nwill neither be driven from some allowance to\nFashion as a symbolic institution, nor from the\nbelief that love is the basis of courtesy. We must\nobtain that, if we can; but by all means we must\naffirm this. Life owes much of its spirit to these\nsharp contrasts. Fashion, which affects to be honor,\nis often, in all men’s experience, only a ballroom-\ncode. Yet so long as it is the highest circle in the\nimagination of the best heads on the planet, there\nis something necessary and excellent in it; for it\nis not to be supposed that men have agreed to be the\ndupes of anything preposterous; and the respect which\nthese mysteries inspire in the most rude and sylvan\ncharacters, and the curiosity with which details of\nhigh life are read, betray the universality of the\nlove of cultivated manners. I know that a comic\ndisparity would be felt, if we should enter the\nacknowledged ’first circles’ and apply these terrific\nstandards of justice, beauty, and benefit to the\nindividuals actually found there. Monarchs and heroes,\nsages and lovers, these gallants are not.  Fashion has\nmany classes and many rules of probation and admission,\nand not the best alone. There is not only the right of\nconquest, which genius pretends,—the individual\ndemonstrating his natural aristocracy best of the best;\n—but less claims will pass for the time; for Fashion\nloves lions, and points like Circe to her horned company.\nThis gentleman is this afternoon arrived from Denmark;\nand that is my Lord Ride, who came yesterday from Bagdat;\nhere is Captain Friese, from Cape Turnagain; and Captain\nSymmes, from the interior of the earth; and Monsieur\nJovaire, who came down this morning in a balloon; Mr.\nHobnail, the reformer; and Reverend Jul Bat, who has\nconverted the whole torrid zone in his Sunday school;\nand Signor Torre del Greco, who extinguished Vesuvius\nby pouring into it the Bay of Naples; Spahi, the Persian\nambassador; and Tul Wil Shan, the exiled nabob of Nepaul,\nwhose saddle is the new moon.—But these are monsters of\none day, and to-morrow will be dismissed to their holes\nand dens; for in these rooms every chair is waited for.\nThe artist, the scholar, and, in general, the clerisy,\nwins their way up into these places and get represented\nhere, somewhat on this footing of conquest.  Another mode\nis to pass through all the degrees, spending a year and a\nday in St. Michael’s Square, being steeped in Cologne\nwater, and perfumed, and dined, and introduced, and\nproperly grounded in all the biography and politics and\nanecdotes of the boudoirs.",
        "Yet these fineries may have grace and wit. Let\nthere be grotesque sculpture about the gates and\noffices of temples. Let the creed and commandments\neven have the saucy homage of parody. The forms of\npoliteness universally express benevolence in\nsuperlative degrees. What if they are in the mouths\nof selfish men, and used as means of selfishness?\nWhat if the false gentleman almost bows the true out\nOf the world? What if the false gentleman contrives\nso to address his companion as civilly to exclude\nall others from his discourse, and also to make them\nfeel excluded? Real service will not lose its nobleness.\nAll generosity is not merely French and sentimental;\nnor is it to be concealed that living blood and a\npassion of kindness does at last distinguish God’s\ngentleman from Fashion’s. The epitaph of Sir Jenkin\nGrout is not wholly unintelligible to the present age:\n\"Here lies Sir Jenkin Grout, who loved his friend and\npersuaded his enemy: what his mouth ate, his hand paid\nfor: what his servants robbed, he restored: if a woman\ngave him pleasure, he supported her in pain: he never\nforgot his children; and whoso touched his finger,\ndrew after it his whole body.” Even the line of heroes\nis not utterly extinct. There is still ever some\nadmirable person in plain clothes, standing on the\nwharf, who jumps in to rescue a drowning man; there\nis still some absurd inventor of charities; some guide\nand comforter of runaway slaves; some friend of Poland;\nsome Philhellene; some fanatic who plants shade-trees\nfor the second and third generation, and orchards when\nhe is grown old; some well-concealed piety; some just\nman happy in an ill fame; some youth ashamed of the\nfavors of fortune and impatiently casting them on other\nshoulders. And these are the centres of society, on\nwhich it returns for fresh impulses. These are the\ncreators of Fashion, which is an attempt to organize\nbeauty of behavior. The beautiful and the generous are,\nin the theory, the doctors and apostles of this church:\nScipio, and the Cid, and Sir Philip Sidney, and\nWashington, and every pure and valiant heart who\nworshipped Beauty by word and by deed. The persons who\nconstitute the natural aristocracy are not found in the\nactual aristocracy, or only on its edge; as the chemical\nenergy of the spectrum is found to be greatest just\noutside of the spectrum. Yet that is the infirmity of\nthe seneschals, who do not know their sovereign when he\nappears. The theory of society supposes the existence\nand sovereignty of these. It divines afar off their\ncoming. It says with the elder gods,—",
        "Therefore, within the ethnical circle of good\nsociety there is a narrower and higher circle,\nconcentration of its light, and flower of courtesy,\nto which there is always a tacit appeal of pride\nand reference, as to its inner and imperial court;\nthe parliament of love and chivalry. And this is\nconstituted of those persons in whom heroic\ndispositions are native; with the love of beauty,\nthe delight in society, and the power to embellish\nthe passing day. If the individuals who compose\nthe purest circles of aristocracy in Europe, the\nguarded blood of centuries, should pass in review,\nin such manner as that we could at leisure and\ncritically inspect their behavior, we might find\nno gentleman and no lady; for although excellent\nspecimens of courtesy and high-breeding would\ngratify us in the assemblage, in the particulars we\nshould detect offence. Because elegance comes of no\nbreeding, but of birth. There must be romance of\ncharacter, or the most fastidious exclusion of\nimpertinencies will not avail. It must be genius which\ntakes that direction: it must be not courteous, but\ncourtesy. High behavior is as rare in fiction as it is\nin fact.  Scott is praised for the fidelity with which\nhe painted the demeanor and conversation of the superior\nclasses. Certainly, kings and queens, nobles and great\nladies, had some right to complain of the absurdity\nthat had been put in their mouths before the days of\nWaverley; but neither does Scott’s dialogue bear\ncriticism. His lords brave each other in smart\nepigramatic speeches, but the dialogue is in costume,\nand does not please on the second reading: it is not\nwarm with life. In Shakspeare alone the speakers do not\nstrut and bridle, the dialogue is easily great, and he\nadds to so many titles that of being the best-bred man\nin England and in Christendom. Once or twice in a\nlifetime we are permitted to enjoy the charm of noble\nmanners, in the presence of a man or woman who have no\nbar in their nature, but whose character emanates freely\nin their word and gesture. A beautiful form is better\nthan a beautiful face; a beautiful behavior is better\nthan a beautiful form: it gives a higher pleasure than\nstatues or pictures; it is the finest of the fine arts.\nA man is but a little thing in the midst of the objects\nof nature, yet, by the moral quality radiating from his\ncountenance he may abolish all considerations of\nmagnitude, and in his manners equal the majesty of the\nworld. I have seen an individual whose manners, though\nwholly within the conventions of elegant society, were\nnever learned there, but were original and commanding\nand held out protection and prosperity; one who did not\nneed the aid of a court-suit, but carried the holiday\nin his eye; who exhilarated the fancy by flinging wide\nthe doors of new modes of existence; who shook off the\ncaptivity of etiquette, with happy, spirited bearing,\ngood-natured and free as Robin Hood; yet with the port\nof an emperor, if need be,—calm, serious, and fit to\nstand the gaze of millions.",
        "The open air and the fields, the street and public\nchambers are the places where Man executes his will;\nlet him yield or divide the sceptre at the door of\nthe house. Woman, with her instinct of behavior,\ninstantly detects in man a love of trifles, any\ncoldness or imbecility, or, in short, any want of\nthat large, flowing, and magnanimous deportment\nwhich is indispensable as an exterior in the hall.\nOur American institutions have been friendly to her,\nand at this moment I esteem it a chief felicity of\nthis country, that it excels in women. A certain\nawkward consciousness of inferiority in the men may\ngive rise to the new chivalry in behalf of Woman’s\nRights. Certainly let her be as much better placed\nin the laws and in social forms as the most zealous\nreformer can ask, but I confide so entirely in her\ninspiring and musical nature, that I believe only\nherself can show us how she shall be served. The\nwonderful generosity of her sentiments raises her at\ntimes into heroical and godlike regions, and verifies\nthe pictures of Minerva, Juno, or Polymnia; and by\nthe firmness with which she treads her upward path,\nshe convinces the coarsest calculators that another\nroad exists than that which their feet know. But\nbesides those who make good in our imagination the\nplace of muses and of Delphic Sibyls, are there not\nwomen who fill our vase with wine and roses to the\nbrim, so that the wine runs over and fills the house\nwith perfume; who inspire us with courtesy; who unloose\nour tongues and we speak; who anoint our eyes and we\nsee? We say things we never thought to have said; for\nonce, our walls of habitual reserve vanished and left\nus at large; we were children playing with children\nin a wide field of flowers. Steep us, we cried, in these\ninfluences, for days, for weeks, and we shall be sunny\npoets and will write out in many-colored words the\nromance that you are. Was it Hafiz or Firdousi that\nsaid of his Persian Lilla, She was an elemental force,\nand astonished me by her amount of life, when I saw her\nday after day radiating, every instant, redundant joy\nand grace on all around her. She was a solvent powerful\nto reconcile all heterogeneous persons into one society:\nlike air or water, an element of such a great range of\naffinities that it combines readily with a thousand\nsubstances. Where she is present all others will be\nmore than they are wont. She was a unit and whole, so\nthat whatsoever she did, became her. She had too much\nsympathy and desire to please, than that you could say\nher manners were marked with dignity, yet no princess\ncould surpass her clear and erect demeanor on each\noccasion. She did not study the Persian grammar, nor\nthe books of the seven poets, but all the poems of the\nseven seemed to be written upon her. For though the\nbias of her nature was not to thought, but to sympathy,\nyet was she so perfect in her own nature as to meet\nintellectual persons by the fulness of her heart,\nwarming them by her sentiments; believing, as she did,\nthat by dealing nobly with all, all would show\nthemselves noble.",
        "I know that this Byzantine pile of chivalry or\nFashion, which seems so fair and picturesque to\nthose who look at the contemporary facts for\nscience or for entertainment, is not equally\npleasant to all spectators.  The constitution of\nour society makes it a giant’s castle to the\nambitious youth who have not found their names\nenrolled in its Golden Book, and whom it has\nexcluded from its coveted honors and privileges.\nThey have yet to learn that its seeming grandeur\nis shadowy and relative: it is great by their\nallowance; its proudest gates will fly open at the\napproach of their courage and virtue. For the\npresent distress, however, of those who are\npredisposed to suffer from the tyrannies of this\ncaprice, there are easy remedies. To remove your\nresidence a couple of miles, or at most four, will\ncommonly relieve the most extreme susceptibility.\nFor the advantages which fashion values are plants\nwhich thrive in very confined localities, in a few\nstreets namely. Out of this precinct they go for\nnothing; are of no use in the farm, in the forest,\nin the market, in war, in the nuptial society, in\nthe literary or scientific circle, at sea, in\nfriendship, in the heaven of thought or virtue.",
        "But we have lingered long enough in these painted\ncourts. The worth of the thing signified must\nvindicate our taste for the emblem. Everything that\nis called fashion and courtesy humbles itself before\nthe cause and fountain of honor, creator of titles\nand dignities, namely the heart of love. This is the\nroyal blood, this the fire, which, in all countries\nand contingencies, will work after its kind and\nconquer and expand all that approaches it. This gives\nnew meanings to every fact. This impoverishes the\nrich, suffering no grandeur but its own. What is rich?\nAre you rich enough to help anybody? to succor the\nunfashionable and the eccentric? rich enough to make\nthe Canadian in his wagon, the itinerant with his\nconsul’s paper which commends him “To the charitable,\"\nthe swarthy Italian with his few broken words of\nEnglish, the lame pauper hunted by overseers from town\nto town, even the poor insane or besotted wreck of man\nor woman, feel the noble exception of your presence and\nyour house from the general bleakness and stoniness; to\nmake such feel that they were greeted with a voice\nwhich made them both remember and hope? What is vulgar\nbut to refuse the claim on acute and conclusive reasons?\nWhat is gentle, but to allow it, and give their heart\nand yours one holiday from the national caution? Without\nthe rich heart, wealth is an ugly beggar. The king of\nSchiraz could not afford to be so bountiful as the poor\nOsman who dwelt at his gate. Osman had a humanity so\nbroad and deep that although his speech was so bold and\nfree with the Koran as to disgust all the dervishes,\nyet was there never a poor outcast, eccentric, or insane\nman, some fool who had cut off his beard, or who had\nbeen mutilated under a vow, or had a pet madness in his\nbrain, but fled at once to him; that great heart lay\nthere so sunny and hospitable in the centre of the\ncountry, that it seemed as if the instinct of all\nsufferers drew them to his side. And the madness which\nhe harbored he did not share. Is not this to be rich?\nthis only to be rightly rich?",
        "But I shall hear without pain that I play the\ncourtier very ill, and talk of that which I do not\nwell understand. It is easy to see, that what is\ncalled by distinction society and fashion has good\nlaws as well as bad, has much that is necessary,\nand much that is absurd. Too good for banning, and\ntoo bad for blessing, it reminds us of a tradition\nof the pagan mythology, in any attempt to settle\nits character. ’I overheard Jove, one day,’ said\nSilenus, ’talking of destroying the earth; he said\nit had failed; they were all rogues and vixens, who\nwent from bad to worse, as fast as the days succeeded\neach other. Minerva said she hoped not; they were\nonly ridiculous little creatures, with this odd\ncircumstance, that they had a blur, or indeterminate\naspect, seen far or seen near; if you called them bad,\nthey would appear so; if you called them good, they\nwould appear so; and there was no one person or action\namong them, which would not puzzle her owl, much more\nall Olympus, to know whether it was fundamentally bad\nor good.’",
        "IT is said that the world is in a state of bankruptcy;\nthat the world owes the world more than the world can\npay, and ought to go into chancery and be sold. I do\nnot think this general insolvency, which involves in\nsome sort all the population, to be the reason of the\ndifficulty experienced at Christmas and New Year and\nother times, in bestowing gifts; since it is always\nso pleasant to be generous, though very vexatious to\npay debts. But the impediment lies in the choosing.\nIf at any time it comes into my head that a present\nis due from me to somebody, I am puzzled what to give,\nuntil the opportunity is gone.  Flowers and fruits are\nalways fit presents; flowers, because they are a proud\nassertion that a ray of beauty outvalues all the\nutilities of the world. These gay natures contrast with\nthe somewhat stern countenance of ordinary nature: they\nare like music heard out of a work-house. Nature does\nnot cocker us; we are children, not pets; she is not\nfond; everything is dealt to us without fear or favor,\nafter severe universal laws. Yet these delicate flowers\nlook like the frolic and interference of love and beauty.\nMen use to tell us that we love flattery even though we\nare not deceived by it, because it shows that we are of\nimportance enough to be courted. Something like that\npleasure, the flowers give us: what am I to whom these\nsweet hints are addressed? Fruits are acceptable gifts,\nbecause they are the flower of commodities, and admit\nof fantastic values being attached to them. If a man\nshould send to me to come a hundred miles to visit him\nand should set before me a basket of fine summer-fruit,\nI should think there was some proportion between the\nlabor and the reward.",
        "For common gifts, necessity makes pertinences and\nbeauty every day, and one is glad when an imperative\nleaves him no option; since if the man at the door\nhave no shoes, you have not to consider whether you\ncould procure him a paint-box. And as it is always\npleasing to see a man eat bread, or drink water, in\nthe house or out of doors, so it is always a great\nsatisfaction to supply these first wants.  Necessity\ndoes everything well. In our condition of universal\ndependence it seems heroic to let the petitioner be\nthe judge of his necessity, and to give all that is\nasked, though at great inconvenience. If it be a\nfantastic desire, it is better to leave to others\nthe office of punishing him. I can think of many\nparts I should prefer playing to that of the Furies.\nNext to things of necessity, the rule for a gift,\nwhich one of my friends prescribed, is that we might\nconvey to some person that which properly belonged\nto his character, and was easily associated with\nhim in thought. But our tokens of compliment and\nlove are for the most part barbarous. Rings and\nother jewels are not gifts, but apologies for gifts.\nThe only gift is a portion of thyself. Thou must\nbleed for me. Therefore the poet brings his poem;\nthe shepherd, his lamb; the farmer, corn; the miner,\na gem; the sailor, coral and shells; the painter,\nhis picture; the girl, a handkerchief of her own\nsewing. This is right and pleasing, for it restores\nsociety in so far to its primary basis, when a man’s\nbiography is conveyed in his gift, and every man’s\nwealth is an index of his merit.  But it is a cold\nlifeless business when you go to the shops to buy me\nsomething which does not represent your life and\ntalent, but a goldsmith’s. This is fit for kings,\nand rich men who represent kings, and a false state\nof property, to make presents of gold and silver\nstuffs, as a kind of symbolical sin-offering, or\npayment of black-mail.",
        "The law of benefits is a difficult channel, which\nrequires careful sailing, or rude boats. It is not\nthe office of a man to receive gifts. How dare you\ngive them? We wish to be self-sustained. We do not\nquite forgive a giver. The hand that feeds us is in\nsome danger of being bitten. We can receive anything\nfrom love, for that is a way of receiving it from\nourselves; but not from any one who assumes to bestow.\nWe sometimes hate the meat which we eat, because there\nseems something of degrading dependence in living\nby it:—",
        "We ask the whole. Nothing less will content us. We\narraign society if it do not give us, besides earth\nand fire and water, opportunity, love, reverence,\nand objects of veneration.",
        "He is a good man who can receive a gift well. We\nare either glad or sorry at a gift, and both emotions\nare unbecoming. Some violence I think is done, some\ndegradation borne, when I rejoice or grieve at a gift.\nI am sorry when my independence is invaded, or when a\ngift comes from such as do not know my spirit, and so\nthe act is not supported; and if the gift pleases me\novermuch, then I should be ashamed that the donor\nshould read my heart, and see that I love his commodity,\nand not him. The gift, to be true, must be the flowing\nof the giver unto me, correspondent to my flowing unto\nhim. When the waters are at level, then my goods pass\nto him, and his to me. All his are mine, all mine his.\nI say to him, How can you give me this pot of oil or\nthis flagon of wine when all your oil and wine is mine,\nwhich belief of mine this gift seems to deny? Hence\nthe fitness of beautiful, not useful things, for gifts.\nThis giving is flat usurpation, and therefore when the\nbeneficiary is ungrateful, as all beneficiaries hate\nall Timons, not at all considering the value of the\ngift but looking back to the greater store it was taken\nfrom,—I rather sympathize with the beneficiary than\nwith the anger of my lord Timon. For the expectation of\ngratitude is mean, and is continually punished by the\ntotal insensibility of the obliged person. It is a great\nhappiness to get off without injury and heart-burning\nfrom one who has had the ill-luck to be served by you.\nIt is a very onerous business, this of being served, and\nthe debtor naturally wishes to give you a slap. A golden\ntext for these gentlemen is that which I so admire in the\nBuddhist, who never thanks, and who says, “Do not flatter\nyour benefactors.”",
        "The reason of these discords I conceive to be that\nthere is no commensurability between a man and any\ngift. You cannot give anything to a magnanimous\nperson. After you have served him he at once puts\nyou in debt by his magnanimity. The service a man\nrenders his friend is trivial and selfish compared\nwith the service he knows his friend stood in\nreadiness to yield him, alike before he had begun\nto serve his friend, and now also. Compared with\nthat good-will I bear my friend, the benefit it is\nin my power to render him seems small. Besides, our\naction on each other, good as well as evil, is so\nincidental and at random that we can seldom hear\nthe acknowledgments of any person who would thank\nus for a benefit, without some shame and humiliation.\nWe can rarely strike a direct stroke, but must be\ncontent with an oblique one; we seldom have the\nsatisfaction of yielding a direct benefit which is\ndirectly received. But rectitude scatters favors on\nevery side without knowing it, and receives with\nwonder the thanks of all people.",
        "I fear to breathe any treason against the majesty\nof love, which is the genius and god of gifts, and\nto whom we must not affect to prescribe. Let him\ngive kingdoms or flower-leaves indifferently. There\nare persons from whom we always expect fairy-tokens;\nlet us not cease to expect them. This is prerogative,\nand not to be limited by our municipal rules. For\nthe rest, I like to see that we cannot be bought and\nsold.  The best of hospitality and of generosity is\nalso not in the will, but in fate. I find that I am\nnot much to you; you do not need me; you do not feel\nme; then am I thrust out of doors, though you proffer\nme house and lands. No services are of any value, but\nonly likeness. When I have attempted to join myself to\nothers by services, it proved an intellectual trick,—\nno more. They eat your service like apples, and leave\nyou out. But love them, and they feel you and delight\nin you all the time.",
        "THERE are days which occur in this climate, at\nalmost any season of the year, wherein the world\nreaches its perfection; when the air, the heavenly\nbodies and the earth, make a harmony, as if nature\nwould indulge her offspring; when, in these bleak\nupper sides of the planet, nothing is to desire\nthat we have heard of the happiest latitudes, and\nwe bask in the shining hours of Florida and Cuba;\nwhen everything that has life gives sign of\nsatisfaction, and the cattle that lie on the ground\nseem to have great and tranquil thoughts. These\nhalcyons may be looked for with a little more\nassurance in that pure October weather which we\ndistinguish by the name of the Indian summer. The\nday, immeasurably long, sleeps over the broad hills\nand warm wide fields. To have lived through all its\nsunny hours, seems longevity enough. The solitary\nplaces do not seem quite lonely. At the gates of the\nforest, the surprised man of the world is forced to\nleave his city estimates of great and small, wise\nand foolish. The knapsack of custom falls off his\nback with the first step he makes into these precincts.\nHere is sanctity which shames our religions, and\nreality which discredits our heroes. Here we find\nNature to be the circumstance which dwarfs every other\ncircumstance, and judges like a god all men that come\nto her. We have crept out of our close and crowded\nhouses into the night and morning, and we see what\nmajestic beauties daily wrap us in their bosom. How\nwillingly we would escape the barriers which render\nthem comparatively impotent, escape the sophistication\nand second thought, and suffer nature to intrance us.\nThe tempered light of the woods is like a perpetual\nmorning, and is stimulating and heroic. The anciently\nreported spells of these places creep on us. The\nstems of pines, hemlocks, and oaks almost gleam like\niron on the excited eye. The incommunicable trees\nbegin to persuade us to live with them, and quit our\nlife of solemn trifles. Here no history, or church,\nor state, is interpolated on the divine sky and the\nimmortal year. How easily we might walk onward into\nthe opening landscape, absorbed by new pictures and\nby thoughts fast succeeding each other, until by\ndegrees the recollection of home was crowded out of\nthe mind, all memory obliterated by the tyranny of\nthe present, and we were led in triumph by nature.",
        "These enchantments are medicinal, they sober and\nheal us. These are plain pleasures, kindly and native\nto us. We come to our own, and make friends with matter,\nwhich the ambitious chatter of the schools would\npersuade us to despise. We never can part with it; the\nmind loves its old home: as water to our thirst, so is\nthe rock, the ground, to our eyes and hands and feet.\nIt is firm water; it is cold flame; what health, what\naffinity! Ever an old friend, ever like a dear friend\nand brother when we chat affectedly with strangers,\ncomes in this honest face, and takes a grave liberty\nwith us, and shames us out of our nonsense. Cities give\nnot the human senses room enough. We go out daily and\nnightly to feed the eyes on the horizon, and require\nso much scope, just as we need water for our bath.\nThere are all degrees of natural influence, from these\nquarantine powers of nature, up to her dearest and\ngravest ministrations to the imagination and the soul.\nThere is the bucket of cold water from the spring, the\nwood-fire to which the chilled traveller rushes for\nsafety,—and there is the sublime moral of autumn and\nof noon. We nestle in nature, and draw our living as\nparasites from her roots and grains, and we receive\nglances from the heavenly bodies, which call us to\nsolitude and foretell the remotest future. The blue\nzenith is the point in which romance and reality meet.\nI think if we should be rapt away into all that we\ndream of heaven, and should converse with Gabriel and\nUriel, the upper sky would be all that would remain of\nour furniture.",
        "It seems as if the day was not wholly profane in\nwhich we have given heed to some natural object.\nThe fall of snowflakes in a still air, preserving\nto each crystal its perfect form; the blowing of\nsleet over a wide sheet of water, and over plains;\nthe waving ryefield; the mimic waving of acres of\nhoustonia, whose innumerable florets whiten and\nripple before the eye; the reflections of trees\nand flowers in glassy lakes; the musical steaming\nodorous south wind, which converts all trees to\nwindharps; the crackling and spurting of hemlock\nin the flames, or of pine logs, which yield glory\nto the walls and faces in the sittingroom,—these\nare the music and pictures of the most ancient\nreligion. My house stands in low land, with limited\noutlook, and on the skirt of the village. But I go\nwith my friend to the shore of our little river,\nand with one stroke of the paddle I leave the village\npolitics and personalities, yes, and the world of\nvillages and personalities behind, and pass into a\ndelicate realm of sunset and moonlight, too bright\nalmost for spotted man to enter without novitiate\nand probation. We penetrate bodily this incredible\nbeauty; we dip our hands in this painted element;\nour eyes are bathed in these lights and forms. A\nholiday, a villeggiatura, a royal revel, the proudest,\nmost heart-rejoicing festival that valor and beauty,\npower and taste, ever decked and enjoyed, establishes\nitself on the instant. These sunset clouds, these\ndelicately emerging stars, with their private and\nineffable glances, signify it and proffer it. I am\ntaught the poorness of our invention, the ugliness of\ntowns and palaces. Art and luxury have early learned\nthat they must work as enhancement and sequel to this\noriginal beauty. I am overinstructed for my return.\nHenceforth I shall be hard to please. I cannot go back\nto toys. I am grown expensive and sophisticated. I can\nno longer live without elegance, but a countryman shall\nbe my master of revels. He who knows the most; he who\nknows what sweets and virtues are in the ground, the\nwaters, the plants, the heavens, and how to come at\nthese enchantments,—is the rich and royal man. Only\nas far as the masters of the world have called in\nnature to their aid, can they reach the height of\nmagnificence. This is the meaning of their hanging-\ngardens, villas, garden-houses, islands, parks and\npreserves, to back their faulty personality with these\nstrong accessories. I do not wonder that the landed\ninterest should be invincible in the State with these\ndangerous auxiliaries. These bribe and invite; not\nkings, not palaces, not men, not women, but these\ntender and poetic stars, eloquent of secret promises.\nWe heard what the rich man said, we knew of his villa,\nhis grove, his wine and his company, but the provocation\nand point of the invitation came out of these beguiling\nstars. In their soft glances I see what men strove to\nrealize in some Versailles, or Paphos, or Ctesiphon.\nIndeed, it is the magical lights of the horizon and the\nblue sky for the background which save all our works of\nart, which were otherwise bawbles. When the rich tax the\npoor with servility and obsequiousness, they should\nconsider the effect of men reputed to be the possessors\nof nature, on imaginative minds. Ah! if the rich were\nrich as the poor fancy riches! A boy hears a military\nband play on the field at night, and he has kings and\nqueens and famous chivalry palpably before him. He hears\nthe echoes of a horn in a hill country, in the Notch\nMountains, for example, which converts the mountains\ninto an Aeolian harp,—and this supernatural tiralira\nrestores to him the Dorian mythology, Apollo, Diana,\nand all divine hunters and huntresses. Can a musical\nnote be so lofty, so haughtily beautiful! To the poor\nyoung poet, thus fabulous is his picture of society; he\nis loyal; he respects the rich; they are rich for the\nsake of his imagination; how poor his fancy would be,\nif they were not rich! That they have some high-fenced\ngrove which they call a park; that they live in larger\nand better-garnished saloons than he has visited, and\ngo in coaches, keeping only the society of the elegant,\nto watering-places and to distant cities,—these make\nthe groundwork from which he has delineated estates of\nromance, compared with which their actual possessions\nare shanties and paddocks. The muse herself betrays\nher son, and enhances the gifts of wealth and well-born\nbeauty by a radiation out of the air, and clouds, and\nforests that skirt the road,—a certain haughty favor,\nas if from patrician genii to patricians, a kind of\naristocracy in nature, a prince of the power of the air.",
        "The moral sensibility which makes Edens and Tempes\nso easily, may not be always found, but the material\nlandscape is never far off. We can find these\nenchantments without visiting the Como Lake, or the\nMadeira Islands. We exaggerate the praises of local\nscenery. In every landscape the point of astonishment\nis the meeting of the sky and the earth, and that is\nseen from the first hillock as well as from the top\nof the Alleghanies. The stars at night stoop down\nover the brownest, homeliest common with all the\nspiritual magnificence which they shed on the Campagna,\nor on the marble deserts of Egypt.  The uprolled clouds\nand the colors of morning and evening will transfigure\nmaples and alders. The difference between landscape and\nlandscape is small, but there is great difference in\nthe beholders. There is nothing so wonderful in any\nparticular landscape as the necessity of being beautiful\nunder which every landscape lies. Nature cannot be\nsurprised in undress. Beauty breaks in everywhere.",
        "But it is very easy to outrun the sympathy of\nreaders on this topic, which schoolmen called\nnatura naturata, or nature passive. One can hardly\nspeak directly of it without excess. It is as easy\nto broach in mixed companies what is called “the\nsubject of religion.” A susceptible person does not\nlike to indulge his tastes in this kind without the\napology of some trivial necessity: he goes to see a\nwood-lot, or to look at the crops, or to fetch a\nplant or a mineral from a remote locality, or he\ncarries a fowling-piece or a fishing-rod. I suppose\nthis shame must have a good reason. A dilettantism\nin nature is barren and unworthy. The fop of fields\nis no better than his brother of Broadway. Men are\nnaturally hunters and inquisitive of wood-craft,\nand I suppose that such a gazetteer as wood-cutters\nand Indians should furnish facts for, would take\nplace in the most sumptuous drawing-rooms of all the\n\"Wreaths” and “Flora’s chaplets” of the bookshops;\nyet ordinarily, whether we are too clumsy for so\nsubtle a topic, or from whatever cause, as soon as\nmen begin to write on nature, they fall into euphuism.\nFrivolity is a most unfit tribute to Pan, who ought\nto be represented in the mythology as the most\ncontinent of gods. I would not be frivolous before\nthe admirable reserve and prudence of time, yet I\ncannot renounce the right of returning often to this\nold topic. The multitude of false churches accredits\nthe true religion. Literature, poetry, science are\nthe homage of man to this unfathomed secret, concerning\nwhich no sane man can affect an indifference or\nincuriosity. Nature is loved by what is best in us. It\nis loved as the city of God, although, or rather because\nthere is no citizen. The sunset is unlike anything that\nis underneath it: it wants men. And the beauty of nature\nmust always seem unreal and mocking, until the landscape\nhas human figures that are as good as itself. If there\nwere good men, there would never be this rapture in\nnature. If the king is in the palace, nobody looks at\nthe walls. It is when he is gone, and the house is filled\nwith grooms and gazers, that we turn from the people to\nfind relief in the majestic men that are suggested by the\npictures and the architecture. The critics who complain\nof the sickly separation of the beauty of nature from\nthe thing to be done, must consider that our hunting of\nthe picturesque is inseparable from our protest against\nfalse society. Man is fallen; nature is erect, and serves\nas a differential thermometer, detecting the presence or\nabsence of the divine sentiment in man. By fault of our\ndulness and selfishness we are looking up to nature, but\nwhen we are convalescent, nature will look up to us. We\nsee the foaming brook with compunction: if our own life\nflowed with the right energy, we should shame the brook.\nThe stream of zeal sparkles with real fire, and not with\nreflex rays of sun and moon. Nature may be as selfishly\nstudied as trade. Astronomy to the selfish becomes\nastrology; psychology, mesmerism (with intent to show\nwhere our spoons are gone); and anatomy and physiology\nbecome phrenology and palmistry.",
        "But taking timely warning, and leaving many things\nunsaid on this topic, let us not longer omit our\nhomage to the Efficient Nature, natura naturans,\nthe quick cause before which all forms flee as the\ndriven snows; itself secret, its works driven\nbefore it in flocks and multitudes, (as the ancient\nrepresented nature by Proteus, a shepherd,) and in\nundescribable variety. It publishes itself in\ncreatures, reaching from particles and spiculae\nthrough transformation on transformation to the\nhighest symmetries, arriving at consummate results\nwithout a shock or a leap. A little heat, that is\na little motion, is all that differences the bald,\ndazzling white and deadly cold poles of the earth\nfrom the prolific tropical climates. All changes\npass without violence, by reason of the two cardinal\nconditions of boundless space and boundless time.\nGeology has initiated us into the secularity of\nnature, and taught us to disuse our dame-school\nmeasures, and exchange our Mosaic and Ptolemaic\nschemes for her large style. We knew nothing rightly,\nfor want of perspective. Now we learn what patient\nperiods must round themselves before the rock is\nformed; then before the rock is broken, and the first\nlichen race has disintegrated the thinnest external\nplate into soil, and opened the door for the remote\nFlora, Fauna, Ceres, and Pomona to come in. How far\noff yet is the trilobite! how far the quadruped! how\ninconceivably remote is man! All duly arrive, and\nthen race after race of men. It is a long way from\ngranite to the oyster; farther yet to Plato and the\npreaching of the immortality of the soul. Yet all\nmust come, as surely as the first atom has two sides.",
        "Motion or change and identity or rest are the first\nand second secrets of nature:—Motion and Rest. The\nwhole code of her laws may be written on the thumbnail,\nor the signet of a ring. The whirling bubble on the\nsurface of a brook admits us to the secret of the\nmechanics of the sky. Every shell on the beach is a\nkey to it. A little water made to rotate in a cup\nexplains the formation of the simpler shells; the\naddition of matter from year to year, arrives at last\nat the most complex forms; and yet so poor is nature\nwith all her craft, that from the beginning to the end\nof the universe she has but one stuff, — but one stuff\nwith its two ends, to serve up all her dream-like\nvariety. Compound it how she will, star, sand, fire,\nwater, tree, man, it is still one stuff, and betrays\nthe same properties.",
        "Nature is always consistent, though she feigns to\ncontravene her own laws. She keeps her laws, and\nseems to transcend them. She arms and equips an\nanimal to find its place and living in the earth,\nand at the same time she arms and equips another\nanimal to destroy it. Space exists to divide\ncreatures; but by clothing the sides of a bird with\na few feathers she gives him a petty omnipresence.\nThe direction is forever onward, but the artist\nstill goes back for materials and begins again with\nthe first elements on the most advanced stage:\notherwise all goes to ruin. If we look at her work,\nwe seem to catch a glance of a system in transition.\nPlants are the young of the world, vessels of health\nand vigor; but they grope ever upward towards\nconsciousness; the trees are imperfect men, and seem\nto bemoan their imprisonment, rooted in the ground.\nThe animal is the novice and probationer of a more\nadvanced order. The men, though young, having tasted\nthe first drop from the cup of thought, are already\ndissipated: the maples and ferns are still uncorrupt;\nyet no doubt when they come to consciousness they too\nwill curse and swear. Flowers so strictly belong to\nyouth that we adult men soon come to feel that their\nbeautiful generations concern not us: we have had our\nday; now let the children have theirs. The flowers jilt\nus, and we are old bachelors with our ridiculous tenderness.",
        "Things are so strictly related, that according to\nthe skill of the eye, from any one object the parts\nand properties of any other may be predicted. If we\nhad eyes to see it, a bit of stone from the city wall\nwould certify us of the necessity that man must exist,\nas readily as the city. That identity makes us all\none, and reduces to nothing great intervals on our\ncustomary scale. We talk of deviations from natural\nlife, as if artificial life were not also natural. The\nsmoothest curled courtier in the boudoirs of a palace\nhas an animal nature, rude and aboriginal as a white\nbear, omnipotent to its own ends, and is directly\nrelated, there amid essences and billetsdoux, to\nHimmaleh mountain-chains and the axis of the globe. If\nwe consider how much we are nature’s, we need not be\nsuperstitious about towns, as if that terrific or\nbenefic force did not find us there also, and fashion\ncities. Nature, who made the mason, made the house.\nWe may easily hear too much of rural influences. The\ncool disengaged air of natural objects makes them\nenviable to us, chafed and irritable creatures with\nred faces, and we think we shall be as grand as they\nif we camp out and eat roots; but let us be men\ninstead of woodchucks and the oak and the elm shall\ngladly serve us, though we sit in chairs of ivory on\ncarpets of silk.",
        "This guiding identity runs through all the surprises\nand contrasts of the piece, and characterizes every\nlaw. Man carries the world in his head, the whole\nastronomy and chemistry suspended in a thought.\nBecause the history of nature is charactered in his\nbrain, therefore is he the prophet and discoverer of\nher secrets. Every known fact in natural science was\ndivined by the presentiment of somebody, before it was\nactually verified. A man does not tie his shoe without\nrecognizing laws which bind the farthest regions of\nnature: moon, plant, gas, crystal, are concrete geometry\nand numbers. Common sense knows its own, and recognizes\nthe fact at first sight in chemical experiment. The\ncommon sense of Franklin, Dalton, Davy and Black, is the\nsame common sense which made the arrangements which now\nit discovers.",
        "If the identity expresses organized rest, the counter\naction runs also into organization. The astronomers\nsaid, ’Give us matter and a little motion and we will\nconstruct the universe. It is not enough that we should\nhave matter, we must also have a single impulse, one\nshove to launch the mass and generate the harmony of\nthe centrifugal and centripetal forces. Once heave the\nball from the hand, and we can show how all this mighty\norder grew.’—’A very unreasonable postulate,’ said the\nmetaphysicians, ’and a plain begging of the question.\nCould you not prevail to know the genesis of projection,\nas well as the continuation of it?’ Nature, meanwhile,\nhad not waited for the discussion, but, right or wrong,\nbestowed the impulse, and the balls rolled. It was no\ngreat affair, a mere push, but the astronomers were\nright in making much of it, for there is no end to the\nconsequences of the act. That famous aboriginal push\npropagates itself through all the balls of the system,\nand through every atom of every ball; through all the\nraces of creatures, and through the history and\nperformances of every individual. Exaggeration is in\nthe course of things. Nature sends no creature, no man\ninto the world without adding a small excess of his\nproper quality. Given the planet, it is still necessary\nto add the impulse; so to every creature nature added\na little violence of direction in its proper path, a\nshove to put it on its way; in every instance a slight\ngenerosity, a drop too much. Without electricity the air\nwould rot, and without this violence of direction which\nmen and women have, without a spice of bigot and fanatic,\nno excitement, no efficiency. We aim above the mark to\nhit the mark. Every act hath some falsehood of exaggeration\nin it. And when now and then comes along some sad, sharp-\neyed man, who sees how paltry a game is played, and refuses\nto play, but blabs the secret;—how then? Is the bird flown?\nO no, the wary Nature sends a new troop of fairer forms, of\nlordlier youths, with a little more excess of direction to\nhold them fast to their several aim; makes them a little\nwrongheaded in that direction in which they are rightest,\nand on goes the game again with new whirl, for a generation\nor two more. The child with his sweet pranks, the fool of\nhis senses, commanded by every sight and sound, without any\npower to compare and rank his sensations, abandoned to a\nwhistle or a painted chip, to a lead dragoon or a\ngingerbread-dog, individualizing everything, generalizing\nnothing, delighted with every new thing, lies down at night\noverpowered by the fatigue which this day of continual\npretty madness has incurred. But Nature has answered her\npurpose with the curly, dimpled lunatic. She has tasked\nevery faculty, and has secured the symmetrical growth of\nthe bodily frame by all these attitudes and exertions,—\nan end of the first importance, which could not be trusted\nto any care less perfect than her own. This glitter, this\nopaline lustre plays round the top of every toy to his\neye to insure his fidelity, and he is deceived to his good.\nWe are made alive and kept alive by the same arts. Let the\nstoics say what they please, we do not eat for the good of\nliving, but because the meat is savory and the appetite is\nkeen. The vegetable life does not content itself with\ncasting from the flower or the tree a single seed, but it\nfills the air and earth with a prodigality of seeds, that,\nif thousands perish, thousands may plant themselves; that\nhundreds may come up, that tens may live to maturity; that\nat least one may replace the parent. All things betray the\nsame calculated profusion. The excess of fear with which\nthe animal frame is hedged round, shrinking from cold,\nstarting at sight of a snake, or at a sudden noise, protects\nus, through a multitude of groundless alarms, from some one\nreal danger at last. The lover seeks in marriage his private\nfelicity and perfection, with no prospective end; and nature\nhides in his happiness her own end, namely, progeny, or the\nperpetuity of the race.",
        "But the craft with which the world is made, runs\nalso into the mind and character of men. No man\nis quite sane; each has a vein of folly in his\ncomposition, a slight determination of blood to\nthe head, to make sure of holding him hard to some\none point which nature had taken to heart. Great\ncauses are never tried on their merits; but the\ncause is reduced to particulars to suit the size\nof the partisans, and the contention is ever hottest\non minor matters. Not less remarkable is the overfaith\nof each man in the importance of what he has to do or\nsay. The poet, the prophet, has a higher value for\nwhat he utters than any hearer, and therefore it gets\nspoken. The strong, self-complacent Luther declares\nwith an emphasis not to be mistaken, that “God himself\ncannot do without wise men.” Jacob Behmen and George\nFox betray their egotism in the pertinacity of their\ncontroversial tracts, and James Naylor once suffered\nhimself to be worshipped as the Christ. Each prophet\ncomes presently to identify himself with his thought,\nand to esteem his hat and shoes sacred. However this\nmay discredit such persons with the judicious, it helps\nthem with the people, as it gives heat, pungency, and\npublicity to their words. A similar experience is not\ninfrequent in private life. Each young and ardent\nperson writes a diary, in which, when the hours of\nprayer and penitence arrive, he inscribes his soul. The\npages thus written are to him burning and fragrant; he\nreads them on his knees by midnight and by the morning\nstar; he wets them with his tears; they are sacred; too\ngood for the world, and hardly yet to be shown to the\ndearest friend. This is the man-child that is born to\nthe soul, and her life still circulates in the babe.\nThe umbilical cord has not yet been cut. After some\ntime has elapsed, he begins to wish to admit his friend\nto this hallowed experience, and with hesitation, yet\nwith firmness, exposes the pages to his eye. Will they\nnot burn his eyes? The friend coldly turns them over,\nand passes from the writing to conversation, with easy\ntransition, which strikes the other party with\nastonishment and vexation. He cannot suspect the writing\nitself. Days and nights of fervid life, of communion\nwith angels of darkness and of light have engraved\ntheir shadowy characters on that tear-stained book. He\nsuspects the intelligence or the heart of his friend.\nIs there then no friend? He cannot yet credit that one\nmay have impressive experience and yet may not know how\nto put his private fact into literature; and perhaps\nthe discovery that wisdom has other tongues and ministers\nthan we, that though we should hold our peace the truth\nwould not the less be spoken, might check injuriously\nthe flames of our zeal. A man can only speak so long as\nhe does not feel his speech to be partial and inadequate.\nIt is partial, but he does not see it to be so whilst he\nutters it. As soon as he is released from the instinctive\nand particular and sees its partiality, he shuts his\nmouth in disgust. For no man can write anything who does\nnot think that what he writes is for the time the history\nof the world; or do anything well who does not esteem his\nwork to be of importance. My work may be of none, but I\nmust not think it of none, or I shall not do it with\nimpunity.",
        "In like manner, there is throughout nature something\nmocking, something that leads us on and on, but\narrives nowhere; keeps no faith with us. All promise\noutruns the performance. We live in a system of\napproximations. Every end is prospective of some other\nend, which is also temporary; a round and final success\nnowhere. We are encamped in nature, not domesticated.\nHunger and thirst lead us on to eat and to drink; but\nbread and wine, mix and cook them how you will, leave\nus hungry and thirsty, after the stomach is full. It\nis the same with all our arts and performances. Our\nmusic, our poetry, our language itself are not\nsatisfactions, but suggestions. The hunger for wealth,\nwhich reduces the planet to a garden, fools the eager\npursuer. What is the end sought? Plainly to secure the\nends of good sense and beauty, from the intrusion of\ndeformity or vulgarity of any kind. But what an operose\nmethod! What a train of means to secure a little\nconversation! This palace of brick and stone, these\nservants, this kitchen, these stables, horses and\nequipage, this bank-stock and file of mortgages; trade\nto all the world, country-house and cottage by the\nwaterside, all for a little conversation, high, clear,\nand spiritual! Could it not be had as well by beggars\non the highway? No, all these things came from successive\nefforts of these beggars to remove friction from the\nwheels of life, and give opportunity. Conversation,\ncharacter, were the avowed ends; wealth was good as it\nappeased the animal cravings, cured the smoky chimney,\nsilenced the creaking door, brought friends together in\na warm and quiet room, and kept the children and the\ndinner-table in a different apartment. Thought, virtue,\nbeauty, were the ends; but it was known that men of\nthought and virtue sometimes had the headache, or wet\nfeet, or could lose good time whilst the room was getting\nwarm in winter days. Unluckily, in the exertions necessary\nto remove these inconveniences, the main attention has\nbeen diverted to this object; the old aims have been lost\nsight of, and to remove friction has come to be the end.\nThat is the ridicule of rich men, and Boston, London,\nVienna, and now the governments generally of the world\nare cities and governments of the rich; and the masses\nare not men, but poor men, that is, men who would be rich;\nthis is the ridicule of the class, that they arrive with\npains and sweat and fury nowhere; when all is done, it is\nfor nothing. They are like one who has interrupted the\nconversation of a company to make his speech, and now has\nforgotten what he went to say. The appearance strikes the\neye everywhere of an aimless society, of aimless nations.\nWere the ends of nature so great and cogent as to exact\nthis immense sacrifice of men?",
        "Quite analogous to the deceits in life, there is,\nas might be expected, a similar effect on the eye\nfrom the face of external nature. There is in woods\nand waters a certain enticement and flattery, together\nwith a failure to yield a present satisfaction. This\ndisappointment is felt in every landscape. I have seen\nthe softness and beauty of the summer clouds floating\nfeathery overhead, enjoying, as it seemed, their height\nand privilege of motion, whilst yet they appeared not\nso much the drapery of this place and hour, as\nforelooking to some pavilions and gardens of festivity\nbeyond. It is an odd jealousy, but the poet finds\nhimself not near enough to his object. The pine-tree,\nthe river, the bank of flowers before him, does not\nseem to be nature. Nature is still elsewhere. This or\nthis is but outskirt and far-off reflection and echo of\nthe triumph that has passed by and is now at its glancing\nsplendor and heyday, perchance in the neighboring fields,\nor, if you stand in the field, then in the adjacent woods.\nThe present object shall give you this sense of stillness\nthat follows a pageant which has just gone by. What\nsplendid distance, what recesses of ineffable pomp and\nloveliness in the sunset! But who can go where they are,\nor lay his hand or plant his foot thereon? Off they fall\nfrom the round world forever and ever. It is the same\namong the men and women as among the silent trees; always\na referred existence, an absence, never a presence and\nsatisfaction. Is it that beauty can never be grasped? in\npersons and in landscape is equally inaccessible? The\naccepted and betrothed lover has lost the wildest charm\nof his maiden in her acceptance of him. She was heaven\nwhilst he pursued her as a star: she cannot be heaven if\nshe stoops to such a one as he.",
        "What shall we say of this omnipresent appearance\nof that first projectile impulse, of this flattery\nand balking of so many well-meaning creatures? Must\nwe not suppose somewhere in the universe a slight\ntreachery and derision? Are we not engaged to a\nserious resentment of this use that is made of us?\nAre we tickled trout, and fools of nature? One look\nat the face of heaven and earth lays all petulance\nat rest, and soothes us to wiser convictions. To the\nintelligent, nature converts itself into a vast\npromise, and will not be rashly explained. Her secret\nis untold. Many and many an Oedipus arrives; he has\nthe whole mystery teeming in his brain. Alas! the\nsame sorcery has spoiled his skill; no syllable can\nhe shape on his lips. Her mighty orbit vaults like\nthe fresh rainbow into the deep, but no archangel’s\nwing was yet strong enough to follow it and report\nof the return of the curve. But it also appears that\nour actions are seconded and disposed to greater\nconclusions than we designed. We are escorted on\nevery hand through life by spiritual agents, and a\nbeneficent purpose lies in wait for us. We cannot\nbandy words with Nature, or deal with her as we deal\nwith persons. If we measure our individual forces\nagainst hers we may easily feel as if we were the\nsport of an insuperable destiny. But if, instead of\nidentifying ourselves with the work, we feel that the\nsoul of the workman streams through us, we shall find\nthe peace of the morning dwelling first in our hearts,\nand the fathomless powers of gravity and chemistry,\nand, over them, of life, preexisting within us in\ntheir highest form.",
        "The uneasiness which the thought of our helplessness\nin the chain of causes occasions us, results from\nlooking too much at one condition of nature, namely,\nMotion. But the drag is never taken from the wheel.\nWherever the impulse exceeds, the Rest or Identity\ninsinuates its compensation. All over the wide fields\nof earth grows the prunella or self-heal. After every\nfoolish day we sleep off the fumes and furies of its\nhours; and though we are always engaged with particulars,\nand often enslaved to them, we bring with us to every\nexperiment the innate universal laws. These, while they\nexist in the mind as ideas, stand around us in nature\nforever embodied, a present sanity to expose and cure\nthe insanity of men. Our servitude to particulars betrays\ninto a hundred foolish expectations. We anticipate a new\nera from the invention of a locomotive, or a balloon;\nthe new engine brings with it the old checks. They say\nthat by electro-magnetism your salad shall be grown from\nthe seed whilst your fowl is roasting for dinner; it is\na symbol of our modern aims and endeavors, of our\ncondensation and acceleration of objects;—but nothing\nis gained; nature cannot be cheated; man’s life is but\nseventy salads long, grow they swift or grow they slow.\nIn these checks and impossibilities however we find our\nadvantage, not less than in the impulses. Let the\nvictory fall where it will, we are on that side. And the\nknowledge that we traverse the whole scale of being,\nfrom the centre to the poles of nature, and have some\nstake in every possibility, lends that sublime lustre to\ndeath, which philosophy and religion have too outwardly\nand literally striven to express in the popular doctrine\nof the immortality of the soul. The reality is more\nexcellent than the report. Here is no ruin, no discontinuity,\nno spent ball. The divine circulations never rest nor linger.\nNature is the incarnation of a thought, and turns to a\nthought again, as ice becomes water and gas. The world is\nmind precipitated, and the volatile essence is forever\nescaping again into the state of free thought. Hence the\nvirtue and pungency of the influence on the mind of natural\nobjects, whether inorganic or organized. Man imprisoned,\nman crystallized, man vegetative, speaks to man impersonated.\nThat power which does not respect quantity, which makes the\nwhole and the particle its equal channel, delegates its smile\nto the morning, and distils its essence into every drop of\nrain. Every moment instructs, and every object: for wisdom\nis infused into every form. It has been poured into us as\nblood; it convulsed us as pain; it slid into us as pleasure;\nit enveloped us in dull, melancholy days, or in days of\ncheerful labor; we did not guess its essence until after a\nlong time.",
        "In dealing with the State we ought to remember\nthat its institution are not aboriginal, though\nthey existed before we were born; that they are\nnot superior to the citizen; that every one of\nthem was once the act of a single man; every law\nand usage was a man’s expedient to meet a particular\ncase; that they all are imitable, all alterable;\nwe may make as good, we may make better. Society\nis an illusion to the young citizen. It lies before\nhim in rigid repose, with certain names, men and\ninstitutions rooted like oak-trees to the centre,\nround which all arrange themselves the best they\ncan. But the old statesman knows that society is\nfluid; there are no such roots and centres, but\nany particle may suddenly become the centre of the\nmovement and compel the system to gyrate round it;\nas every man of strong will, like Pisistratus, or\nCromwell, does for a time, and every man of truth,\nlike Plato or Paul, does forever. But politics rest\non necessary foundations, and cannot be treated with\nlevity. Republics abound in young civilians, who\nbelieve that the laws make the city, that grave\nmodifications of the policy and modes of living and\nemployments of the population, that commerce,\neducation, and religion, may be voted in or out; and\nthat any measure, though it were absurd, may be\nimposed on a people if only you can get sufficient\nvoices to make it a law. But the wise know that\nfoolish legislation is a rope of sand which perishes\nin the twisting; that the State must follow and not\nlead the character and progress of the citizen; the\nstrongest usurper is quickly got rid of; and they\nonly who build on Ideas, build for eternity; and that\nthe form of government which prevails is the expression\nof what cultivation exists in the population which\npermits it. The law is only a memorandum. We are\nsuperstitious, and esteem the statute somewhat: so much\nlife as it has in the character of living men is its\nforce. The statute stands there to say, Yesterday we\nagreed so and so, but how feel ye this article to-day?\nOur statute is a currency which we stamp with our own\nportrait: it soon becomes unrecognizable, and in process\nof time will return to the mint. Nature is not democratic,\nnor limited-monarchical, but despotic, and will not be\nfooled or abated of any jot of her authority by the\npertest of her sons; and as fast as the public mind is\nopened to more intelligence, the code is seen to be\nbrute and stammering. It speaks not articulately, and\nmust be made to. Meantime the education of the general\nmind never stops. The reveries of the true and simple\nare prophetic. What the tender poetic youth dreams, and\nprays, and paints to-day, but shuns the ridicule of\nsaying aloud, shall presently be the resolutions of\npublic bodies; then shall be carried as grievance and\nbill of rights through conflict and war, and then shall\nbe triumphant law and establishment for a hundred years,\nuntil it gives place in turn to new prayers and pictures.\nThe history of the State sketches in coarse outline the\nprogress of thought, and follows at a distance the\ndelicacy of culture and of aspiration.",
        "The theory of politics which has possessed the\nmind of men, and which they have expressed the\nbest they could in their laws and in their\nrevolutions, considers persons and property as\nthe two objects for whose protection government\nexists. Of persons, all have equal rights, in\nvirtue of being identical in nature. This interest\nof course with its whole power demands a democracy.\nWhilst the rights of all as persons are equal, in\nvirtue of their access to reason, their rights in\nproperty are very unequal. One man owns his clothes,\nand another owns a county. This accident, depending\nprimarily on the skill and virtue of the parties,\nof which there is every degree, and secondarily on\npatrimony, falls unequally, and its rights of course\nare unequal. Personal rights, universally the same,\ndemand a government framed on the ratio of the\ncensus; property demands a government framed on the\nratio of owners and of owning.  Laban, who has\nflocks and herds, wishes them looked after by an\nofficer on the frontiers, lest the Midianites shall\ndrive them off; and pays a tax to that end. Jacob\nhas no flocks or herds and no fear of the Midianites,\nand pays no tax to the officer. It seemed fit that\nLaban and Jacob should have equal rights to elect\nthe officer who is to defend their persons, but that\nLaban and not Jacob should elect the officer who is\nto guard the sheep and cattle. And if question arise\nwhether additional officers or watch-towers should be\nprovided, must not Laban and Isaac, and those who must\nsell part of their herds to buy protection for the\nrest, judge better of this, and with more right, than\nJacob, who, because he is a youth and a traveller, eats\ntheir bread and not his own?",
        "In the earliest society the proprietors made their\nown wealth, and so long as it comes to the owners\nin the direct way, no other opinion would arise in\nany equitable community than that property should\nmake the law for property, and persons the law for\npersons.",
        "But property passes through donation or inheritance\nto those who do not create it. Gift, in one case,\nmakes it as really the new owner’s, as labor made it\nthe first owner’s: in the other case, of patrimony,\nthe law makes an ownership which will be valid in\neach man’s view according to the estimate which he\nsets on the public tranquillity.",
        "It was not however found easy to embody the readily\nadmitted principle that property should make law\nfor property, and persons for persons; since persons\nand property mixed themselves in every transaction.\nAt last it seemed settled that the rightful\ndistinction was that the proprietors should have more\nelective franchise than non-proprietors, on the Spartan\nprinciple of “calling that which is just, equal; not\nthat which is equal, just.”",
        "That principle no longer looks so self-evident as\nit appeared in former times, partly, because doubts\nhave arisen whether too much weight had not been\nallowed in the laws to property, and such a structure\ngiven to our usages as allowed the rich to encroach\non the poor, and to keep them poor; but mainly because\nthere is an instinctive sense, however obscure and yet\ninarticulate, that the whole constitution of property,\non its present tenures, is injurious, and its influence\non persons deteriorating and degrading; that truly the\nonly interest for the consideration of the State is\npersons; that property will always follow persons; that\nthe highest end of government is the culture of men;\nand if men can be educated, the institutions will share\ntheir improvement and the moral sentiment will write\nthe law of the land.",
        "If it be not easy to settle the equity of this\nquestion, the peril is less when we take note of\nour natural defences. We are kept by better guards\nthan the vigilance of such magistrates as we\ncommonly elect.  Society always consists in greatest\npart of young and foolish persons. The old, who have\nseen through the hypocrisy of courts and statesmen,\ndie and leave no wisdom to their sons. They believe\ntheir own newspaper, as their fathers did at their\nage. With such an ignorant and deceivable majority,\nStates would soon run to ruin, but that there are\nlimitations beyond which the folly and ambition of\ngovernors cannot go. Things have their laws, as well\nas men; and things refuse to be trifled with.\nProperty will be protected. Corn will not grow unless\nit is planted and manured; but the farmer will not\nplant or hoe it unless the chances are a hundred to\none that he will cut and harvest it. Under any forms,\npersons and property must and will have their just\nsway. They exert their power, as steadily as matter\nits attraction.  Cover up a pound of earth never so\ncunningly, divide and subdivide it; melt it to liquid,\nconvert it to gas; it will always weigh a pound; it\nwill always attract and resist other matter by the\nfull virtue of one pound weight:—and the attributes\nof a person, his wit and his moral energy, will\nexercise, under any law or extinguishing tyranny, their\nproper force,—if not overtly, then covertly; if not\nfor the law, then against it; if not wholesomely, then\npoisonously; with right, or by might.",
        "The boundaries of personal influence it is impossible\nto fix, as persons are organs of moral or supernatural\nforce. Under the dominion of an idea which possesses\nthe minds of multitudes, as civil freedom, or the\nreligious sentiment, the powers of persons are no\nlonger subjects of calculation. A nation of men\nunanimously bent on freedom or conquest can easily\nconfound the arithmetic of statists, and achieve\nextravagant actions, out of all proportion to their\nmeans; as the Greeks, the Saracens, the Swiss, the\nAmericans, and the French have done.",
        "In like manner to every particle of property belongs\nits own attraction. A cent is the representative of\na certain quantity of corn or other commodity. Its\nvalue is in the necessities of the animal man. It is\nso much warmth, so much bread, so much water, so much\nland. The law may do what it will with the owner of\nproperty; its just power will still attach to the\ncent. The law may in a mad freak say that all shall\nhave power except the owners of property; they shall\nhave no vote. Nevertheless, by a higher law, the\nproperty will, year after year, write every statute\nthat respects property. The non-proprietor will be\nthe scribe of the proprietor. What the owners wish to\ndo, the whole power of property will do, either\nthrough the law or else in defiance of it. Of course\nI speak of all the property, not merely of the great\nestates. When the rich are outvoted, as frequently\nhappens, it is the joint treasury of the poor which\nexceeds their accumulations. Every man owns something,\nif it is only a cow, or a wheel-barrow, or his arms,\nand so has that property to dispose of.",
        "The same necessity which secures the rights of\nperson and property against the malignity or folly\nof the magistrate, determines the form and methods\nof governing, which are proper to each nation and\nto its habit of thought, and nowise transferable to\nother states of society. In this country we are very\nvain of our political institutions, which are singular\nin this, that they sprung, within the memory of living\nmen, from the character and condition of the people,\nwhich they still express with sufficient fidelity,—\nand we ostentatiously prefer them to any other in\nhistory. They are not better, but only fitter for us.\nWe may be wise in asserting the advantage in modern\ntimes of the democratic form, but to other states of\nsociety, in which religion consecrated the monarchical,\nthat and not this was expedient. Democracy is better\nfor us, because the religious sentiment of the present\ntime accords better with it. Born democrats, we are\nnowise qualified to judge of monarchy, which, to our\nfathers living in the monarchical idea, was also\nrelatively right. But our institutions, though in\ncoincidence with the spirit of the age, have not any\nexemption from the practical defects which have\ndiscredited other forms. Every actual State is corrupt.\nGood men must not obey the laws too well. What satire\non government can equal the severity of censure conveyed\nin the word politic, which now for ages has signified\ncunning, intimating that the State is a trick?",
        "The same benign necessity and the same practical\nabuse appear in the parties, into which each State\ndivides itself, of opponents and defenders of the\nadministration of the government. Parties are also\nfounded on instincts, and have better guides to\ntheir own humble aims than the sagacity of their\nleaders.  They have nothing perverse in their origin,\nbut rudely mark some real and lasting relation. We\nmight as wisely reprove the east wind or the frost,\nas a political party, whose members, for the most\npart, could give no account of their position, but\nstand for the defence of those interests in which\nthey find themselves. Our quarrel with them begins\nwhen they quit this deep natural ground at the bidding\nof some leader, and obeying personal considerations,\nthrow themselves into the maintenance and defence of\npoints nowise belonging to their system. A party is\nperpetually corrupted by personality. Whilst we\nabsolve the association from dishonesty, we cannot\nextend the same charity to their leaders. They reap\nthe rewards of the docility and zeal of the masses\nwhich they direct. Ordinarily our parties are parties\nof circumstance, and not of principle; as the planting\ninterest in conflict with the commercial; the party of\ncapitalists and that of operatives; parties which are\nidentical in their moral character, and which can\neasily change ground with each other in the support of\nmany of their measures. Parties of principle, as,\nreligious sects, or the party of free-trade, of universal\nsuffrage, of abolition of slavery, of abolition of\ncapital punishment,—degenerate into personalities, or\nwould inspire enthusiasm. The vice of our leading\nparties in this country (which may be cited as a fair\nspecimen of these societies of opinion) is that they do\nnot plant themselves on the deep and necessary grounds\nto which they are respectively entitled, but lash\nthemselves to fury in the carrying of some local and\nmomentary measure, nowise useful to the commonwealth.\nOf the two great parties which at this hour almost\nshare the nation between them, I should say that one\nhas the best cause, and the other contains the best men.\nThe philosopher, the poet, or the religious man will of\ncourse wish to cast his vote with the democrat, for\nfree-trade, for wide suffrage, for the abolition of\nlegal cruelties in the penal code, and for facilitating\nin every manner the access of the young and the poor to\nthe sources of wealth and power. But he can rarely accept\nthe persons whom the so-called popular party propose to\nhim as representatives of these liberalities. They have\nnot at heart the ends which give to the name of democracy\nwhat hope and virtue are in it. The spirit of our American\nradicalism is destructive and aimless: it is not loving;\nit has no ulterior and divine ends, but is destructive\nonly out of hatred and selfishness. On the other side,\nthe conservative party, composed of the most moderate,\nable, and cultivated part of the population, is timid,\nand merely defensive of property. It vindicates no right,\nit aspires to no real good, it brands no crime, it\nproposes no generous policy; it does not build, nor write,\nnor cherish the arts, nor foster religion, nor establish\nschools, nor encourage science, nor emancipate the slave,\nnor befriend the poor, or the Indian, or the immigrant.\nFrom neither party, when in power, has the world any\nbenefit to expect in science, art, or humanity, at all\ncommensurate with the resources of the nation.",
        "I do not for these defects despair of our republic.\nWe are not at the mercy of any waves of chance. In\nthe strife of ferocious parties, human nature always\nfinds itself cherished; as the children of the\nconvicts at Botany Bay are found to have as healthy\na moral sentiment as other children. Citizens of\nfeudal states are alarmed at our democratic institutions\nlapsing into anarchy, and the older and more cautious\namong ourselves are learning from Europeans to look\nwith some terror at our turbulent freedom. It is said\nthat in our license of construing the Constitution,\nand in the despotism of public opinion, we have no\nanchor; and one foreign observer thinks he has found\nthe safeguard in the sanctity of Marriage among us;\nand another thinks he has found it in our Calvinism.\nFisher Ames expressed the popular security more wisely,\nwhen he compared a monarchy and a republic, saying that\na monarchy is a merchantman, which sails well, but will\nsometimes strike on a rock and go to the bottom; whilst\na republic is a raft, which would never sink, but then\nyour feet are always in water. No forms can have any\ndangerous importance whilst we are befriended by the\nlaws of things. It makes no difference how many tons\nweight of atmosphere presses on our heads, so long as\nthe same pressure resists it within the lungs. Augment\nthe mass a thousand fold, it cannot begin to crush us,\nas long as reaction is equal to action. The fact of two\npoles, of two forces, centripetal and centrifugal, is\nuniversal, and each force by its own activity develops\nthe other.  Wild liberty develops iron conscience. Want\nof liberty, by strengthening law and decorum, stupefies\nconscience. ’Lynch-law’ prevails only where there is\ngreater hardihood and self-subsistency in the leaders.\nA mob cannot be a permanency; everybody’s interest\nrequires that it should not exist, and only justice\nsatisfies all.",
        "We must trust infinitely to the beneficent necessity\nwhich shines through all laws. Human nature expresses\nitself in them as characteristically as in statues,\nor songs, or railroads; and an abstract of the codes\nof nations would be a transcript of the common\nconscience. Governments have their origin in the\nmoral identity of men. Reason for one is seen to be\nreason for another, and for every other. There is a\nmiddle measure which satisfies all parties, be they\nnever so many or so resolute for their own. Every\nman finds a sanction for his simplest claims and deeds\nin decisions of his own mind, which he calls Truth and\nHoliness. In these decisions all the citizens find a\nperfect agreement, and only in these; not in what is\ngood to eat, good to wear, good use of time, or what\namount of land or of public aid, each is entitled to\nclaim. This truth and justice men presently endeavor\nto make application of to the measuring of land, the\napportionment of service, the protection of life and\nproperty. Their first endeavors, no doubt, are very\nawkward. Yet absolute right is the first governor; or,\nevery government is an impure theocracy.  The idea\nafter which each community is aiming to make and mend\nits law, is the will of the wise man.  The wise man it\ncannot find in nature, and it makes awkward but earnest\nefforts to secure his government by contrivance; as by\ncausing the entire people to give their voices on every\nmeasure; or by a double choice to get the representation\nof the whole; or, by a selection of the best citizens;\nor to secure the advantages of efficiency and internal\npeace by confiding the government to one, who may himself\nselect his agents. All forms of government symbolize an\nimmortal government, common to all dynasties and\nindependent of numbers, perfect where two men exist,\nperfect where there is only one man.",
        "Every man’s nature is a sufficient advertisement\nto him of the character of his fellows. My right\nand my wrong is their right and their wrong. Whilst\nI do what is fit for me, and abstain from what is\nunfit, my neighbor and I shall often agree in our\nmeans, and work together for a time to one end. But\nwhenever I find my dominion over myself not sufficient\nfor me, and undertake the direction of him also, I\noverstep the truth, and come into false relations to\nhim. I may have so much more skill or strength than\nhe that he cannot express adequately his sense of\nwrong, but it is a lie, and hurts like a lie both him\nand me. Love and nature cannot maintain the assumption;\nit must be executed by a practical lie, namely by force.\nThis undertaking for another is the blunder which stands\nin colossal ugliness in the governments of the world.\nIt is the same thing in numbers, as in a pair, only not\nquite so intelligible. I can see well enough a great\ndifference between my setting myself down to a self-\ncontrol, and my going to make somebody else act after\nmy views; but when a quarter of the human race assume\nto tell me what I must do, I may be too much disturbed\nby the circumstances to see so clearly the absurdity\nof their command. Therefore all public ends look vague\nand quixotic beside private ones. For any laws but\nthose which men make for themselves, are laughable. If\nI put myself in the place of my child, and we stand in\none thought and see that things are thus or thus, that\nperception is law for him and me. We are both there,\nboth act. But if, without carrying him into the thought,\nI look over into his plot, and, guessing how it is with\nhim, ordain this or that, he will never obey me. This\nis the history of governments,—one man does something\nwhich is to bind another. A man who cannot be acquainted\nwith me, taxes me; looking from afar at me ordains that\na part of my labor shall go to this or that whimsical\nend,—not as I, but as he happens to fancy. Behold the\nconsequence. Of all debts men are least willing to pay\nthe taxes. What a satire is this on government!  Everywhere\nthey think they get their money’s worth, except for these.",
        "Hence the less government we have the better,—\nthe fewer laws, and the less confided power. The\nantidote to this abuse of formal Government is\nthe influence of private character, the growth of\nthe Individual; the appearance of the principal to\nsupersede the proxy; the appearance of the wise\nman; of whom the existing government is, it must\nbe owned, but a shabby imitation. That which all\nthings tend to educe; which freedom, cultivation,\nintercourse, revolutions, go to form and deliver,\nis character; that is the end of Nature, to reach\nunto this coronation of her king. To educate the\nwise man the State exists, and with the appearance\nof the wise man the State expires. The appearance\nof character makes the State unnecessary. The wise\nman is the State. He needs no army, fort, or navy,\n—he loves men too well; no bribe, or feast, or\npalace, to draw friends to him; no vantage ground,\nno favorable circumstance. He needs no library, for\nhe has not done thinking; no church, for he is a\nprophet; no statute book, for he has the lawgiver;\nno money, for he is value; no road, for he is at\nhome where he is; no experience, for the life of the\ncreator shoots through him, and looks from his eyes.\nHe has no personal friends, for he who has the spell\nto draw the prayer and piety of all men unto him\nneeds not husband and educate a few to share with\nhim a select and poetic life. His relation to men is\nangelic; his memory is myrrh to them; his presence,\nfrankincense and flowers.",
        "We think our civilization near its meridian, but\nwe are yet only at the cock-crowing and the morning\nstar.  In our barbarous society the influence of\ncharacter is in its infancy. As a political power,\nas the rightful lord who is to tumble all rulers\nfrom their chairs, its presence is hardly yet\nsuspected. Malthus and Ricardo quite omit it; the\nAnnual Register is silent; in the Conversations’\nLexicon it is not set down; the President’s Message,\nthe Queen’s Speech, have not mentioned it; and yet\nit is never nothing. Every thought which genius and\npiety throw into the world, alters the world. The\ngladiators in the lists of power feel, through all\ntheir frocks of force and simulation, the presence\nof worth. I think the very strife of trade and\nambition are confession of this divinity; and\nsuccesses in those fields are the poor amends, the\nfig-leaf with which the shamed soul attempts to hide\nits nakedness. I find the like unwilling homage in\nall quarters. It is because we know how much is due\nfrom us that we are impatient to show some petty\ntalent as a substitute for worth. We are haunted by\na conscience of this right to grandeur of character,\nand are false to it. But each of us has some talent,\ncan do somewhat useful, or graceful, or formidable,\nor amusing, or lucrative. That we do, as an apology\nto others and to ourselves for not reaching the mark\nof a good and equal life. But it does not satisfy us,\nwhilst we thrust it on the notice of our companions.\nIt may throw dust in their eyes, but does not smooth\nour own brow, or give us the tranquillity of the\nstrong when we walk abroad. We do penance as we go.\nOur talent is a sort of expiation, and we are\nconstrained to reflect on our splendid moment with\na certain humiliation, as somewhat too fine, and not\nas one act of many acts, a fair expression of our\npermanent energy. Most persons of ability meet in\nsociety with a kind of tacit appeal. Each seems to\nsay, ’I am not all here.’ Senators and presidents\nhave climbed so high with pain enough, not because\nthey think the place specially agreeable, but as an\napology for real worth, and to vindicate their manhood\nin our eyes. This conspicuous chair is their compensation\nto themselves for being of a poor, cold, hard nature.\nThey must do what they can. Like one class of forest\nanimals, they have nothing but a prehensile tail; climb\nthey must, or crawl. If a man found himself so rich-\nnatured that he could enter into strict relations with\nthe best persons and make life serene around him by the\ndignity and sweetness of his behavior, could he afford\nto circumvent the favor of the caucus and the press, and\ncovet relations so hollow and pompous as those of a\npolitician? Surely nobody would be a charlatan who could\nafford to be sincere.",
        "The tendencies of the times favor the idea of\nself-government, and leave the individual, for all\ncode, to the rewards and penalties of his own\nconstitution; which work with more energy than we\nbelieve whilst we depend on artificial restraints.\nThe movement in this direction has been very marked\nin modern history.  Much has been blind and\ndiscreditable, but the nature of the revolution is\nnot affected by the vices of the revolters; for this\nis a purely moral force. It was never adopted by any\nparty in history, neither can be. It separates the\nindividual from all party, and unites him at the\nsame time to the race. It promises a recognition of\nhigher rights than those of personal freedom, or the\nsecurity of property. A man has a right to be employed,\nto be trusted, to be loved, to be revered. The power\nof love, as the basis of a State, has never been tried.\nWe must not imagine that all things are lapsing into\nconfusion if every tender protestant be not compelled\nto bear his part in certain social conventions; nor\ndoubt that roads can be built, letters carried, and\nthe fruit of labor secured, when the government of\nforce is at an end. Are our methods now so excellent\nthat all competition is hopeless? could not a nation\nof friends even devise better ways? On the other hand,\nlet not the most conservative and timid fear anything\nfrom a premature surrender of the bayonet and the\nsystem of force. For, according to the order of nature,\nwhich is quite superior to our will, it stands thus;\nthere will always be a government of force where men\nare selfish; and when they are pure enough to abjure\nthe code of force they will be wise enough to see how\nthese public ends of the post-office, of the highway,\nof commerce and the exchange of property, of museums\nand libraries, of institutions of art and science can\nbe answered.",
        "We live in a very low state of the world, and pay\nunwilling tribute to governments founded on force.\nThere is not, among the most religious and instructed\nmen of the most religious and civil nations, a\nreliance on the moral sentiment and a sufficient\nbelief in the unity of things, to persuade them that\nsociety can be maintained without artificial restraints,\nas well as the solar system; or that the private citizen\nmight be reasonable and a good neighbor, without the\nhint of a jail or a confiscation. What is strange too,\nthere never was in any man sufficient faith in the power\nof rectitude to inspire him with the broad design of\nrenovating the State on the principle of right and love.\nAll those who have pretended this design have been\npartial reformers, and have admitted in some manner the\nsupremacy of the bad State. I do not call to mind a\nsingle human being who has steadily denied the authority\nof the laws, on the simple ground of his own moral\nnature. Such designs, full of genius and full of fate as\nthey are, are not entertained except avowedly as air-\npictures. If the individual who exhibits them dare to\nthink them practicable, he disgusts scholars and churchmen;\nand men of talent and women of superior sentiments cannot\nhide their contempt. Not the less does nature continue to\nfill the heart of youth with suggestions of this enthusiasm,\nand there are now men,—if indeed I can speak in the plural\nnumber,—more exactly, I will say, I have just been\nconversing with one man, to whom no weight of adverse\nexperience will make it for a moment appear impossible that\nthousands of human beings might exercise towards each other\nthe grandest and simplest sentiments, as well as a knot of\nfriends, or a pair of lovers.",
        "I CANNOT often enough say that a man is only a\nrelative and representative nature. Each is a hint\nof the truth, but far enough from being that truth\nwhich yet he quite newly and inevitably suggests\nto us. If I seek it in him I shall not find it.\nCould any man conduct into me the pure stream of\nthat which he pretends to be! Long afterwards I\nfind that quality elsewhere which he promised me.\nThe genius of the Platonists is intoxicating to the\nstudent, yet how few particulars of it can I detach\nfrom all their books.  The man momentarily stands\nfor the thought, but will not bear examination; and\na society of men will cursorily represent well enough\na certain quality and culture, for example, chivalry\nor beauty of manners; but separate them and there is\nno gentleman and no lady in the group. The least hint\nsets us on the pursuit of a character which no man\nrealizes. We have such exorbitant eyes that on seeing\nthe smallest arc we complete the curve, and when the\ncurtain is lifted from the diagram which it seemed to\nveil, we are vexed to find that no more was drawn than\njust that fragment of an arc which we first beheld. We\nare greatly too liberal in our construction of each\nother’s faculty and promise. Exactly what the parties\nhave already done they shall do again; but that which\nwe inferred from their nature and inception, they will\nnot do. That is in nature, but not in them. That happens\nin the world, which we often witness in a public debate.\nEach of the speakers expresses himself imperfectly; no\none of them hears much that another says, such is the\npreoccupation of mind of each; and the audience, who\nhave only to hear and not to speak, judge very wisely\nand superiorly how wrongheaded and unskilful is each of\nthe debaters to his own affair. Great men or men of great\ngifts you shall easily find, but symmetrical men never.\nWhen I meet a pure intellectual force or a generosity of\naffection, I believe here then is man; and am presently\nmortified by the discovery that this individual is no\nmore available to his own or to the general ends than\nhis companions; because the power which drew my respect\nis not supported by the total symphony of his talents.\nAll persons exist to society by some shining trait of\nbeauty or utility which they have. We borrow the\nproportions of the man from that one fine feature, and\nfinish the portrait symmetrically; which is false, for\nthe rest of his body is small or deformed. I observe a\nperson who makes a good public appearance, and conclude\nthence the perfection of his private character, on which\nthis is based; but he has no private character. He is a\ngraceful cloak or lay-figure for holidays. All our poets,\nheroes, and saints, fail utterly in some one or in many\nparts to satisfy our idea, fail to draw our spontaneous\ninterest, and so leave us without any hope of realization\nbut in our own future. Our exaggeration of all fine\ncharacters arises from the fact that we identify each in\nturn with the soul. But there are no such men as we fable;\nno Jesus, nor Pericles, nor Caesar, nor Angelo, nor\nWashington, such as we have made. We consecrate a great\ndeal of nonsense because it was allowed by great men.\nThere is none without his foible. I verily believe if an\nangel should come to chant the chorus of the moral law,\nhe would eat too much gingerbread, or take liberties with\nprivate letters, or do some precious atrocity. It is bad\nenough that our geniuses cannot do anything useful, but\nit is worse that no man is fit for society who has fine\ntraits. He is admired at a distance, but he cannot come\nnear without appearing a cripple. The men of fine parts\nprotect themselves by solitude, or by courtesy, or by\nsatire, or by an acid worldly manner, each concealing as\nhe best can his incapacity for useful association, but\nthey want either love or self-reliance.",
        "Our native love of reality joins with this experience\nto teach us a little reserve, and to dissuade a too\nsudden surrender to the brilliant qualities of persons.\nYoung people admire talents or particular excellences;\nas we grow older we value total powers and effects, as\nthe impression, the quality, the spirit of men and\nthings. The genius is all. The man,—it is his system:\nwe do not try a solitary word or act, but his habit.\nThe acts which you praise, I praise not, since they are\ndepartures from his faith, and are mere compliances.\nThe magnetism which arranges tribes and races in one\npolarity is alone to be respected; the men are steel-\nfilings. Yet we unjustly select a particle, and say,\n’O steel-filing number one! what heart-drawings I feel\nto thee! what prodigious virtues are these of thine! how\nconstitutional to thee, and incommunicable.’ Whilst we\nspeak the loadstone is withdrawn; down falls our filing\nin a heap with the rest, and we continue our mummery to\nthe wretched shaving. Let us go for universals; for the\nmagnetism, not for the needles. Human life and its\npersons are poor empirical pretensions. A personal\ninfluence is an ignis fatuus. If they say it is great,\nit is great; if they say it is small, it is small; you\nsee it, and you see it not, by turns; it borrows all its\nsize from the momentary estimation of the speakers: the\nWill-of-the-wisp vanishes if you go too near, vanishes\nif you go too far, and only blazes at one angle.  Who\ncan tell if Washington be a great man or no? Who can\ntell if Franklin be? Yes, or any but the twelve, or six,\nor three great gods of fame? And they too loom and fade\nbefore the eternal.",

We adjust our instrument for general\nobservation, and sweep the heavens as easily as we\npick out a single figure in the terrestrial landscape.\nWe are practically skilful in detecting elements for\nwhich we have no place in our theory, and no name. Thus\nwe are very sensible of an atmospheric influence in men\nand in bodies of men, not accounted for in an arithmetical\naddition of all their measurable properties. There is a\ngenius of a nation, which is not to be found in the\nnumerical citizens, but which characterizes the society.\nEngland, strong, punctual, practical, well-spoken England\nI should not find if I should go to the island to seek it.\nIn the parliament, in the play-house, at dinner-tables, I\nmight see a great number of rich, ignorant, book-read,\nconventional, proud men,—many old women,—and not anywhere\nthe Englishman who made the good speeches, combined the\naccurate engines, and did the bold and nervous deeds. It\nis even worse in America, where, from the intellectual\nquickness of the race, the genius of the country is more\nsplendid in its promise and more slight in its performance.\nWebster cannot do the work of Webster. We conceive distinctly\nenough the French, the Spanish, the German genius, and it\nis not the less real that perhaps we should not meet in\neither of those nations a single individual who corresponded\nwith the type. We infer the spirit of the nation in great\nmeasure from the language, which is a sort of monument to\nwhich each forcible individual in a course of many hundred\nyears has contributed a stone. And, universally, a good\nexample of this social force is the veracity of language,\nwhich cannot be debauched. In any controversy concerning\nmorals, an appeal may be made with safety to the sentiments\nwhich the language of the people expresses. Proverbs, words,\nand grammar-inflections convey the public sense with more\npurity and precision than the wisest individual.",
        "In the famous dispute with the Nominalists, the\nRealists had a good deal of reason. General ideas\nare essences. They are our gods: they round and\nennoble the most partial and sordid way of living.\nOur proclivity to details cannot quite degrade our\nlife and divest it of poetry. The day-laborer is\nreckoned as standing at the foot of the social scale,\nyet he is saturated with the laws of the world. His\nmeasures are the hours; morning and night, solstice\nand equinox, geometry, astronomy and all the lovely\naccidents of nature play through his mind. Money,\nwhich represents the prose of life, and which is\nhardly spoken of in parlors without an apology, is,\nin its effects and laws, as beautiful as roses.\nProperty keeps the accounts of the world, and is\nalways moral. The property will be found where the\nlabor, the wisdom, and the virtue have been in nations,\nin classes, and (the whole life-time considered, with\nthe compensations) in the individual also. How wise\nthe world appears, when the laws and usages of nations\nare largely detailed, and the completeness of the\nmunicipal system is considered! Nothing is left out.\nIf you go into the markets and the custom-houses, the\ninsurers’ and notaries’ offices, the offices of sealers\nof weights and measures, of inspection of provisions,—\nit will appear as if one man had made it all. Wherever\nyou go, a wit like your own has been before you, and\nhas realized its thought. The Eleusinian mysteries, the\nEgyptian architecture, the Indian astronomy, the Greek\nsculpture, show that there always were seeing and knowing\nmen in the planet.

        "I am very much struck in literature by the appearance\nthat one person wrote all the books; as if the editor\nof a journal planted his body of reporters in different\nparts of the field of action, and relieved some by\nothers from time to time; but there is such equality\nand identity both of judgment and point of view in\nthe narrative that it is plainly the work of one all-\nseeing, all-hearing gentleman. I looked into Pope’s\nOdyssey yesterday: it is as correct and elegant after\nour canon of to-day as if it were newly written. The\nmodernness of all good books seems to give me an\nexistence as wide as man. What is well done I feel as\nif I did; what is ill done I reck not of. Shakspeare’s\npassages of passion (for example, in Lear and Hamlet)\nare in the very dialect of the present year. I am\nfaithful again to the whole over the members in my\nuse of books. I find the most pleasure in reading a\nbook in a manner least flattering to the author. I\nread Proclus, and sometimes Plato, as I might read a\ndictionary, for a mechanical help to the fancy and\nthe imagination. I read for the lustres, as if one\nshould use a fine picture in a chromatic experiment,\nfor its rich colors. ’Tis not Proclus, but a piece\nof nature and fate that I explore. It is a greater\njoy to see the author’s author, than himself. A higher\npleasure of the same kind I found lately at a concert,\nwhere I went to hear Handel’s Messiah. As the master\noverpowered the littleness and incapableness of the\nperformers and made them conductors of his electricity,\nso it was easy to observe what efforts nature was\nmaking, through so many hoarse, wooden, and imperfect\npersons, to produce beautiful voices, fluid and soul-\nguided men and women. The genius of nature was paramount\nat the oratorio.",
        "This preference of the genius to the parts is the\nsecret of that deification of art, which is found\nin all superior minds. Art, in the artist, is\nproportion, or a habitual respect to the whole by\nan eye loving beauty in details. And the wonder and\ncharm of it is the sanity in insanity which it denotes.\nProportion is almost impossible to human beings. There\nis no one who does not exaggerate. In conversation,\nmen are encumbered with personality, and talk too much.\nIn modern sculpture, picture, and poetry, the beauty is\nmiscellaneous; the artist works here and there and at\nall points, adding and adding, instead of unfolding\nthe unit of his thought. Beautiful details we must have,\nor no artist; but they must be means and never other.\nThe eye must not lose sight for a moment of the purpose.\nLively boys write to their ear and eye, and the cool\nreader finds nothing but sweet jingles in it. When they\ngrow older, they respect the argument.",

Homoeopathy is insignificant as an art\nof healing, but of great value as criticism on the\nhygeia or medical practice of the time. So with\nMesmerism, Swedenborgism, Fourierism, and the Millennial\nChurch; they are poor pretensions enough, but good\ncriticism on the science, philosophy, and preaching\nof the day.

I wish to speak with all respect of\npersons, but sometimes I must pinch myself to keep\nawake and preserve the due decorum. They melt so\nfast into each other that they are like grass and\ntrees, and it needs an effort to treat them as\nindividuals. Though the uninspired man certainly\nfinds persons a conveniency in household matters,\nthe divine man does not respect them; he sees them\nas a rack of clouds, or a fleet of ripples which\nthe wind drives over the surface of the water. But\nthis is flat rebellion. Nature will not be Buddhist:\nshe resents generalizing, and insults the philosopher\nin every moment with a million of fresh particulars.\nIt is all idle talking: as much as a man is a whole,\nso is he also a part; and it were partial not to\nsee it. What you say in your pompous distribution\nonly distributes you into your class and section. You\nhave not got rid of parts by denying them, but are the\nmore partial. You are one thing, but Nature is one\nthing and the other thing, in the same moment. She will\nnot remain orbed in a thought, but rushes into persons;\nand when each person, inflamed to a fury of personality,\nwould conquer all things to his poor crotchet, she\nraises up against him another person, and by many persons\nincarnates again a sort of whole. She will have all. Nick\nBottom cannot play all the parts, work it how he may;\nthere will be somebody else, and the world will be round.\nEverything must have its flower or effort at the beautiful,\ncoarser or finer according to its stuff. They relieve and\nrecommend each other, and the sanity of society is a\nbalance of a thousand insanities. She punishes\nabstractionists, and will only forgive an induction which\nis rare and casual. We like to come to a height of land\nand see the landscape, just as we value a general remark\nin conversation. But it is not the intention of Nature\nthat we should live by general views.  We fetch fire and\nwater, run about all day among the shops and markets, and\nget our clothes and shoes made and mended, and are the\nvictims of these details; and once in a fortnight we arrive\nperhaps at a rational moment. If we were not thus infatuated,\nif we saw the real from hour to hour, we should not be here\nto write and to read, but should have been burned or frozen\nlong ago. She would never get anything done, if she suffered\nadmirable Crichtons and universal geniuses.

As the frugal farmer takes care that his\ncattle shall eat down the rowen, and swine shall eat the\nwaste of his house, and poultry shall pick the crumbs,—so\nour economical mother dispatches a new genius and habit of\nmind into every district and condition of existence, plants\nan eye wherever a new ray of light can fall, and gathering\nup into some man every property in the universe, establishes\nthousandfold occult mutual attractions among her offspring,\nthat all this wash and waste of power may be imparted and\nexchanged.",

Solitude would ripen a plentiful\ncrop of despots. The recluse thinks of men as having\nhis manner, or as not having his manner; and as having\ndegrees of it, more and less. But when he comes into a\npublic assembly he sees that men have very different\nmanners from his own, and in their way admirable. In\nhis childhood and youth he has had many checks and\ncensures, and thinks modestly enough of his own endowment.\nWhen afterwards he comes to unfold it in propitious\ncircumstance, it seems the only talent; he is delighted\nwith his success, and accounts himself already the fellow\nof the great. But he goes into a mob, into a banking\nhouse, into a mechanic’s shop, into a mill, into a\nlaboratory, into a ship, into a camp, and in each new\nplace he is no better than an idiot; other talents take\nplace, and rule the hour.

        "For Nature, who abhors mannerism, has set her heart\non breaking up all styles and tricks, and it is so\nmuch easier to do what one has done before than to\ndo a new thing, that there is a perpetual tendency\nto a set mode. In every conversation, even the highest,\nthere is a certain trick, which may be soon learned\nby an acute person and then that particular style\ncontinued indefinitely. Each man too is a tyrant in\ntendency, because he would impose his idea on others;\nand their trick is their natural defence. Jesus would\nabsorb the race; but Tom Paine or the coarsest\nblasphemer helps humanity by resisting this exuberance\nof power. Hence the immense benefit of party in politics,\nas it reveals faults of character in a chief, which the\nintellectual force of the persons, with ordinary\nopportunity and not hurled into aphelion by hatred,\ncould not have seen. Since we are all so stupid, what\nbenefit that there should be two stupidities! It is\nlike that brute advantage so essential to astronomy,\nof having the diameter of the earth’s orbit for a base\nof its triangles.

Why not a new man?\nHere is a new enterprise of Brook Farm, of Skeneateles,\nof Northampton: why so impatient to baptize them Essenes,\nor Port-Royalists, or Shakers, or by any known and effete\nname? Let it be a new way of living. Why have only two\nor three ways of life, and not thousands? Every man is\nwanted, and no man is wanted much.  We came this time\nfor condiments, not for corn. We want the great genius\nonly for joy; for one star more in our constellation,\nfor one tree more in our grove. But he thinks we wish\nto belong to him, as he wishes to occupy us.

A recluse sees only\ntwo or three persons, and allows them all their room;\nthey spread themselves at large. The statesman looks\nat many, and compares the few habitually with others,\nand these look less. Yet are they not entitled to this\ngenerosity of reception? and is not munificence the\nmeans of insight? For though gamesters say that the\ncards beat all the players, though they were never so\nskilful, yet in the contest we are now considering,\nthe players are also the game, and share the power of\nthe cards. If you criticise a fine genius, the odds\nare that you are out of your reckoning, and instead\nof the poet, are censuring your own caricature of\nhim. For there is somewhat spheral and infinite in\nevery man, especially in every genius, which, if you\ncan come very near him, sports with all your\nlimitations. For rightly every man is a channel through\nwhich heaven floweth, and whilst I fancied I was\ncriticising him, I was censuring or rather terminating\nmy own soul.

        "But care is taken that the whole tune shall be\nplayed. If we were not kept among surfaces, every\nthing would be large and universal; now the excluded\nattributes burst in on us with the more brightness\nthat they have been excluded. “Your turn now, my\nturn next,” is the rule of the game. The universality\nbeing hindered in its primary form, comes in the\nsecondary form of all sides; the points come in\nsuccession to the meridian, and by the speed of\nrotation a new whole is formed. Nature keeps herself\nwhole and her representation complete in the experience\nof each mind. She suffers no seat to be vacant in her\ncollege. It is the secret of the world that all things\nsubsist and do not die but only retire a little from\nsight and afterwards return again. Whatever does not\nconcern us is concealed from us. As soon as a person\nis no longer related to our present well-being, he is\nconcealed, or dies, as we say. Really, all things and\npersons are related to us, but according to our nature\nthey act on us not at once but in succession, and we\nare made aware of their presence one at a time. All\npersons, all things which we have known, are here\npresent, and many more than we see; the world is full.\nAs the ancient said, the world is a plenum or solid;\nand if we saw all things that really surround us we\nshould be imprisoned and unable to move. For though\nnothing is impassable to the soul, but all things are\npervious to it and like highways, yet this is only\nwhilst the soul does not see them. As soon as the soul\nsees any object, it stops before that object.  Therefore,\nthe divine Providence which keeps the universe open in\nevery direction to the soul, conceals all the furniture\nand all the persons that do not concern a particular\nsoul, from the senses of that individual. Through\nsolidest eternal things the man finds his road as if\nthey did not subsist, and does not once suspect their\nbeing. As soon as he needs a new object, suddenly he\nbeholds it, and no longer attempts to pass through it,\nbut takes another way. When he has exhausted for the\ntime the nourishment to be drawn from any one person\nor thing, that object is withdrawn from his observation,\nand though still in his immediate neighborhood, he does\nnot suspect its presence. Nothing is dead: men feign\nthemselves dead, and endure mock funerals and mournful\nobituaries, and there they stand looking out of the\nwindow, sound and well, in some new and strange disguise.\nJesus is not dead; he is very well alive: nor John, nor\nPaul, nor Mahomet, nor Aristotle; at times we believe\nwe have seen them all, and could easily tell the names\nunder which they go.",
        "If we cannot make voluntary and conscious steps\nin the admirable science of universals, let us see\nthe parts wisely, and infer the genius of nature\nfrom the best particulars with a becoming charity.\nWhat is best in each kind is an index of what\nshould be the average of that thing. Love shows me\nthe opulence of nature, by disclosing to me in my\nfriend a hidden wealth, and I infer an equal depth\nof good in every other direction. It is commonly\nsaid by farmers that a good pear or apple costs no\nmore time or pains to rear than a poor one; so I\nwould have no work of art, no speech, or action, or\nthought, or friend, but the best.",

We must reconcile the contradictions\nas we can, but their discord and their concord\nintroduce wild absurdities into our thinking and speech.\nNo sentence will hold the whole truth, and the only way\nin which we can be just, is by giving ourselves the lie;\nSpeech is better than silence; silence is better than\nspeech;—All things are in contact; every atom has a\nsphere of repulsion;—Things are, and are not, at the\nsame time;—and the like. All the universe over, there\nis but one thing, this old Two-Face, creator-creature,\nmind-matter, right-wrong, of which any proposition may\nbe affirmed or denied. Very fitly therefore I assert\nthat every man is a partialist, that nature secures him\nas an instrument by self-conceit, preventing the\ntendencies to religion and science; and now further\nassert, that, each man’s genius being nearly and\naffectionately explored, he is justified in his\nindividuality, as his nature is found to be immense;\nand now I add that every man is a universalist also,\nand, as our earth, whilst it spins on its own axis,\nspins all the time around the sun through the celestial\nspaces, so the least of its rational children, the most\ndedicated to his private affair, works out, though as it\nwere under a disguise, the universal problem. We fancy\nmen are individuals; so are pumpkins; but every pumpkin\nin the field goes through every point of pumpkin history.\nThe rabid democrat, as soon as he is senator and rich man,\nhas ripened beyond possibility of sincere radicalism, and\nunless he can resist the sun, he must be conservative the\nremainder of his days.

I talked yesterday with a\npair of philosophers; I endeavored to show my good\nmen that I love everything by turns and nothing long;\nthat I loved the centre, but doated on the superficies;\nthat I loved man, if men seemed to me mice and rats;\nthat I revered saints, but woke up glad that the old\npagan world stood its ground and died hard; that I was\nglad of men of every gift and nobility, but would not\nlive in their arms. Could they but once understand\nthat I loved to know that they existed, and heartily\nwished them God-speed, yet, out of my poverty of life\nand thought, had no word or welcome for them when they\ncame to see me, and could well consent to their living\nin Oregon, for any claim I felt on them,—it would be\na great satisfaction.",
        "A lecture read before the society in Armory Hall, on Sunday, March 3, 1844.",
        "WHOEVER has had opportunity of acquaintance with\nsociety in New England during the last twenty-five\nyears, with those middle and with those leading\nsections that may constitute any just representation\nof the character and aim of the community, will have\nbeen struck with the great activity of thought and\nexperimenting.  His attention must be commanded by\nthe signs that the Church, or religious party, is\nfalling from the Church nominal, and is appearing\nin temperance and non-resistance societies; in\nmovements of abolitionists and of socialists; and\nin very significant assemblies called Sabbath and\nBible Conventions; composed of ultraists, of seekers,\nof all the soul of the soldiery of dissent, and meeting\nto call in question the authority of the Sabbath, of\nthe priesthood, and of the Church. In these movements\nnothing was more remarkable than the discontent they\nbegot in the movers. The spirit of protest and of\ndetachment drove the members of these Conventions to\nbear testimony against the Church, and immediately\nafterward, to declare their discontent with these\nConventions, their independence of their colleagues,\nand their impatience of the methods whereby they were\nworking. They defied each other, like a congress of\nkings, each of whom had a realm to rule, and a way of\nhis own that made concert unprofitable. What a fertility\nof projects for the salvation of the world! One apostle\nthought all men should go to farming, and another that\nno man should buy or sell, that the use of money was the\ncardinal evil; another that the mischief was in our diet,\nthat we eat and drink damnation. These made unleavened\nbread, and were foes to the death to fermentation. It was\nin vain urged by the housewife that God made yeast, as\nwell as dough, and loves fermentation just as dearly as\nhe loves vegetation; that fermentation develops the\nsaccharine element in the grain, and makes it more\npalatable and more digestible. No; they wish the pure\nwheat, and will die but it shall not ferment. Stop, dear\nnature, these incessant advances of thine; let us scotch\nthese ever-rolling wheels! Others attacked the system\nof agriculture, the use of animal manures in farming,\nand the tyranny of man over brute nature; these abuses\npolluted his food. The ox must be taken from the plough\nand the horse from the cart, the hundred acres of the\nfarm must be spaded, and the man must walk, wherever\nboats and locomotives will not carry him. Even the insect\nworld was to be defended,—that had been too long neglected,\nand a society for the protection of ground-worms, slugs,\nand mosquitos was to be incorporated without delay. With\nthese appeared the adepts of homoeopathy, of hydropathy,\nof mesmerism, of phrenology, and their wonderful theories\nof the Christian miracles! Others assailed particular\nvocations, as that of the lawyer, that of the merchant,\nof the manufacturer, of the clergyman, of the scholar.\nOthers attacked the institution of marriage as the fountain\nof social evils. Others devoted themselves to the worrying\nof churches and meetings for public worship; and the fertile\nforms of antinomianism among the elder puritans seemed to\nhave their match in the plenty of the new harvest of reform.",
        "With this din of opinion and debate there was a\nkeener scrutiny of institutions and domestic life\nthan any we had known; there was sincere protesting\nagainst existing evils, and there were changes of\nemployment dictated by conscience. No doubt there\nwas plentiful vaporing, and cases of backsliding\nmight occur. But in each of these movements emerged\na good result, a tendency to the adoption of simpler\nmethods, and an assertion of the sufficiency of the\nprivate man. Thus it was directly in the spirit and\ngenius of the age, what happened in one instance\nwhen a church censured and threatened to excommunicate\none of its members on account of the somewhat hostile\npart to the church which his conscience led him to\ntake in the anti-slavery business; the threatened\nindividual immediately excommunicated the church in a\npublic and formal process.  This has been several times\nrepeated: it was excellent when it was done the first\ntime, but of course loses all value when it is copied.\nEvery project in the history of reform, no matter how\nviolent and surprising, is good when it is the dictate\nof a man’s genius and constitution, but very dull and\nsuspicious when adopted from another. It is right and\nbeautiful in any man to say, ’I will take this coat,\nor this book, or this measure of corn of yours,’—in\nwhom we see the act to be original, and to flow from\nthe whole spirit and faith of him; for then that taking\nwill have a giving as free and divine; but we are very\neasily disposed to resist the same generosity of speech\nwhen we miss originality and truth to character in it.",
        "There was in all the practical activities of New\nEngland for the last quarter of a century, a gradual\nwithdrawal of tender consciences from the social\norganizations. There is observable throughout, the\ncontest between mechanical and spiritual methods, but\nwith a steady tendency of the thoughtful and virtuous\nto a deeper belief and reliance on spiritual facts.",
        "In politics for example it is easy to see the progress\nof dissent. The country is full of rebellion; the\ncountry is full of kings. Hands off! let there be no\ncontrol and no interference in the administration of\nthe affairs of this kingdom of me. Hence the growth of\nthe doctrine and of the party of Free Trade, and the\nwillingness to try that experiment, in the face of what\nappear incontestable facts. I confess, the motto of\nthe Globe newspaper is so attractive to me that I can\nseldom find much appetite to read what is below it in\nits columns: “The world is governed too much.” So the\ncountry is frequently affording solitary examples of\nresistance to the government, solitary nullifiers, who\nthrow themselves on their reserved rights; nay, who\nhave reserved all their rights; who reply to the assessor\nand to the clerk of court that they do not know the\nState, and embarrass the courts of law by non-juring and\nthe commander-in-chief of the militia by non-resistance.",
        "The same disposition to scrutiny and dissent appeared\nin civil, festive, neighborly, and domestic society.\nA restless, prying, conscientious criticism broke out\nin unexpected quarters. Who gave me the money with\nwhich I bought my coat? Why should professional labor\nand that of the counting-house be paid so disproportionately\nto the labor of the porter and woodsawyer? This whole\nbusiness of Trade gives me to pause and think, as it\nconstitutes false relations between men; inasmuch as I\nam prone to count myself relieved of any responsibility\nto behave well and nobly to that person whom I pay with\nmoney; whereas if I had not that commodity, I should be\nput on my good behavior in all companies, and man would\nbe a benefactor to man, as being himself his only\ncertificate that he had a right to those aids and services\nwhich each asked of the other. Am I not too protected a\nperson? is there not a wide disparity between the lot of\nme and the lot of thee, my poor brother, my poor sister?\nAm I not defrauded of my best culture in the loss of\nthose gymnastics which manual labor and the emergencies\nof poverty constitute? I find nothing healthful or exalting\nin the smooth conventions of society; I do not like the\nclose air of saloons. I begin to suspect myself to be a\nprisoner, though treated with all this courtesy and luxury.\nI pay a destructive tax in my conformity.",
        "The same insatiable criticism may be traced in the\nefforts for the reform of Education. The popular\neducation has been taxed with a want of truth and\nnature. It was complained that an education to things\nwas not given. We are students of words: we are shut\nup in schools, and colleges, and recitation-rooms,\nfor ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with\na bag of wind, a memory of words, and do not know a\nthing. We cannot use our hands, or our legs, or our\neyes, or our arms. We do not know an edible root in\nthe woods, we cannot tell our course by the stars,\nnor the hour of the day by the sun. It is well if we\ncan swim and skate. We are afraid of a horse, of a cow,\nof a dog, of a snake, of a spider. The Roman rule was\nto teach a boy nothing that he could not learn standing.\nThe old English rule was, ’All summer in the field, and\nall winter in the study.’ And it seems as if a man\nshould learn to plant, or to fish, or to hunt, that he\nmight secure his subsistence at all events, and not be\npainful to his friends and fellow-men. The lessons of\nscience should be experimental also. The sight of the\nplanet through a telescope is worth all the course on\nastronomy; the shock of the electric spark in the elbow,\noutvalues all the theories; the taste of the nitrous\noxide, the firing of an artificial volcano, are better\nthan volumes of chemistry.",
        "One of the traits of the new spirit is the inquisition\nit fixed on our scholastic devotion to the dead\nlanguages. The ancient languages, with great beauty of\nstructure, contain wonderful remains of genius, which\ndraw, and always will draw, certain likeminded men,—\nGreek men, and Roman men,—in all countries, to their\nstudy; but by a wonderful drowsiness of usage they had\nexacted the study of all men. Once (say two centuries\nago), Latin and Greek had a strict relation to all the\nscience and culture there was in Europe, and the\nMathematics had a momentary importance at some era of\nactivity in physical science. These things became\nstereotyped as education, as the manner of men is. But\nthe Good Spirit never cared for the colleges, and though\nall men and boys were now drilled in Latin, Greek, and\nMathematics, it had quite left these shells high and dry\non the beach, and was now creating and feeding other\nmatters at other ends of the world. But in a hundred\nhigh schools and colleges this warfare against common\nsense still goes on. Four, or six, or ten years, the\npupil is parsing Greek and Latin, and as soon as he\nleaves the University, as it is ludicrously called, he\nshuts those books for the last time. Some thousands of\nyoung men are graduated at our colleges in this country\nevery year, and the persons who, at forty years, still\nread Greek, can all be counted on your hand. I never met\nwith ten. Four or five persons I have seen who read Plato.",
        "But is not this absurd, that the whole liberal talent\nof this country should be directed in its best years\non studies which lead to nothing? What was the\nconsequence? Some intelligent persons said or thought,\n’Is that Greek and Latin some spell to conjure with,\nand not words of reason? If the physician, the lawyer,\nthe divine, never use it to come at their ends, I need\nnever learn it to come at mine. Conjuring is gone out\nof fashion, and I will omit this conjugating, and go\nstraight to affairs.’ So they jumped the Greek and Latin,\nand read law, medicine, or sermons, without it. To the\nastonishment of all, the self-made men took even ground\nat once with the oldest of the regular graduates, and in\na few months the most conservative circles of Boston and\nNew York had quite forgotten who of their gownsmen was\ncollege-bred, and who was not.",
        "One tendency appears alike in the philosophical\nspeculation and in the rudest democratical movements,\nthrough all the petulance and all the puerility, the\nwish, namely, to cast aside the superfluous and\narrive at short methods; urged, as I suppose, by an\nintuition that the human spirit is equal to all\nemergencies, alone, and that man is more often injured\nthan helped by the means he uses.",
        "I conceive this gradual casting off of material aids,\nand the indication of growing trust in the private\nself-supplied powers of the individual, to be the\naffirmative principle of the recent philosophy, and\nthat it is feeling its own profound truth and is\nreaching forward at this very hour to the happiest\nconclusions. I readily concede that in this, as in\nevery period of intellectual activity, there has been\na noise of denial and protest; much was to be resisted,\nmuch was to be got rid of by those who were reared in\nthe old, before they could begin to affirm and to\nconstruct. Many a reformer perishes in his removal of\nrubbish; and that makes the offensiveness of the class.\nThey are partial; they are not equal to the work they\npretend. They lose their way; in the assault on the\nkingdom of darkness they expend all their energy on\nsome accidental evil, and lose their sanity and power\nof benefit. It is of little moment that one or two or\ntwenty errors of our social system be corrected, but\nof much that the man be in his senses.",
        "The criticism and attack on institutions, which we\nhave witnessed, has made one thing plain, that\nsociety gains nothing whilst a man, not himself\nrenovated, attempts to renovate things around him:\nhe has become tediously good in some particular but\nnegligent or narrow in the rest; and hypocrisy and\nvanity are often the disgusting result.",
        "It is handsomer to remain in the establishment better\nthan the establishment, and conduct that in the best\nmanner, than to make a sally against evil by some\nsingle improvement, without supporting it by a total\nregeneration. Do not be so vain of your one objection.\nDo you think there is only one? Alas! my good friend,\nthere is no part of society or of life better than\nany other part. All our things are right and wrong\ntogether.  The wave of evil washes all our institutions\nalike. Do you complain of our Marriage? Our marriage is\nno worse than our education, our diet, our trade, our\nsocial customs. Do you complain of the laws of Property?\nIt is a pedantry to give such importance to them. Can we\nnot play the game of life with these counters, as well\nas with those? in the institution of property, as well\nas out of it? Let into it the new and renewing principle\nof love, and property will be universality. No one gives\nthe impression of superiority to the institution, which\nhe must give who will reform it. It makes no difference\nwhat you say, you must make me feel that you are aloof\nfrom it; by your natural and supernatural advantages do\neasily see to the end of it,—do see how man can do\nwithout it. Now all men are on one side. No man deserves\nto be heard against property. Only Love, only an Idea,\nis against property as we hold it.",
        "I cannot afford to be irritable and captious, nor\nto waste all my time in attacks. If I should go out\nof church whenever I hear a false sentiment I could\nnever stay there five minutes. But why come out? the\nstreet is as false as the church, and when I get to\nmy house, or to my manners, or to my speech, I have\nnot got away from the lie.  When we see an eager\nassailant of one of these wrongs, a special reformer,\nwe feel like asking him, What right have you, sir, to\nyour one virtue? Is virtue piecemeal? This is a jewel\namidst the rags of a beggar.",
        "In another way the right will be vindicated. In\nthe midst of abuses, in the heart of cities, in\nthe aisles of false churches, alike in one place\nand in another,—wherever, namely, a just and\nheroic soul finds itself, there it will do what\nis next at hand, and by the new quality of character\nit shall put forth it shall abrogate that old\ncondition, law or school in which it stands, before\nthe law of its own mind.",
        "If partiality was one fault of the movement party,\nthe other defect was their reliance on Association.\nDoubts such as those I have intimated drove many\ngood persons to agitate the questions of social\nreform. But the revolt against the spirit of commerce,\nthe spirit of aristocracy, and the inveterate abuses\nof cities, did not appear possible to individuals;\nand to do battle against numbers they armed themselves\nwith numbers, and against concert they relied on new\nconcert.",
        "Following or advancing beyond the ideas of St. Simon,\nof Fourier, and of Owen, three communities have\nalready been formed in Massachusetts on kindred plans,\nand many more in the country at large. They aim to\ngive every member a share in the manual labor, to give\nan equal reward to labor and to talent, and to unite a\nliberal culture with an education to labor. The scheme\noffers, by the economies of associated labor and expense,\nto make every member rich, on the same amount of property,\nthat, in separate families, would leave every member poor.\nThese new associations are composed of men and women of\nsuperior talents and sentiments; yet it may easily be\nquestioned whether such a community will draw, except in\nits beginnings, the able and the good; whether those who\nhave energy will not prefer their chance of superiority\nand power in the world, to the humble certainties of the\nassociation; whether such a retreat does not promise to\nbecome an asylum to those who have tried and failed,\nrather than a field to the strong; and whether the members\nwill not necessarily be fractions of men, because each\nfinds that he cannot enter it, without some compromise.\nFriendship and association are very fine things, and a\ngrand phalanx of the best of the human race, banded for\nsome catholic object; yes, excellent; but remember that\nno society can ever be so large as one man. He, in his\nfriendship, in his natural and momentary associations,\ndoubles or multiplies himself; but in the hour in which\nhe mortgages himself to two or ten or twenty, he dwarfs\nhimself below the stature of one.",
        "But the men of less faith could not thus believe,\nand to such, concert appears the sole specific of\nstrength.  I have failed, and you have failed, but\nperhaps together we shall not fail. Our housekeeping\nis not satisfactory to us, but perhaps a phalanx, a\ncommunity, might be. Many of us have differed in\nopinion, and we could find no man who could make the\ntruth plain, but possibly a college, or an ecclesiastical\ncouncil might. I have not been able either to persuade\nmy brother or to prevail on myself, to disuse the traffic\nor the potation of brandy, but perhaps a pledge of total\nabstinence might effectually restrain us. The candidate\nmy party votes for is not to be trusted with a dollar,\nbut he will be honest in the Senate, for we can bring\npublic opinion to bear on him. Thus concert was the\nspecific in all cases. But concert is neither better\nnor worse, neither more nor less potent than individual\nforce. All the men in the world cannot make a statue\nwalk and speak, cannot make a drop of blood, or a blade\nof grass, any more than one man can. But let there be\none man, let there be truth in two men, in ten men, then\nis concert for the first time possible; because the force\nwhich moves the world is a new quality, and can never be\nfurnished by adding whatever quantities of a different\nkind. What is the use of the concert of the false and\nthe disunited? There can be no concert in two, where\nthere is no concert in one. When the individual is not\nindividual, but is dual; when his thoughts look one way\nand his actions another; when his faith is traversed by\nhis habits; when his will, enlightened by reason, is\nwarped by his sense; when with one hand he rows and with\nthe other backs water, what concert can be?",
        "I do not wonder at the interest these projects\ninspire. The world is awaking to the idea of union,\nand these experiments show what it is thinking of.\nIt is and will be magic. Men will live and communicate,\nand plough, and reap, and govern, as by added ethereal\npower, when once they are united; as in a celebrated\nexperiment, by expiration and respiration exactly\ntogether, four persons lift a heavy man from the ground\nby the little finger only, and without sense of weight.\nBut this union must be inward, and not one of covenants,\nand is to be reached by a reverse of the methods they\nuse. The union is only perfect when all the uniters\nare isolated. It is the union of friends who live in\ndifferent streets or towns. Each man, if he attempts\nto join himself to others, is on all sides cramped and\ndiminished of his proportion; and the stricter the union\nthe smaller and the more pitiful he is. But leave him\nalone, to recognize in every hour and place the secret\nsoul; he will go up and down doing the works of a true\nmember, and, to the astonishment of all, the work will\nbe done with concert, though no man spoke.  Government\nwill be adamantine without any governor. The union must\nbe ideal in actual individualism.",
        "I pass to the indication in some particulars of\nthat faith in man, which the heart is preaching\nto us in these days, and which engages the more\nregard, from the consideration that the speculations\nof one generation are the history of the next\nfollowing.",
        "In alluding just now to our system of education, I\nspoke of the deadness of its details. But it is open\nto graver criticism than the palsy of its members:\nit is a system of despair. The disease with which the\nhuman mind now labors is want of faith. Men do not\nbelieve in a power of education. We do not think we\ncan speak to divine sentiments in man, and we do not\ntry.  We renounce all high aims. We believe that the\ndefects of so many perverse and so many frivolous\npeople who make up society, are organic, and society\nis a hospital of incurables. A man of good sense but\nof little faith, whose compassion seemed to lead him\nto church as often as he went there, said to me that\n\"he liked to have concerts, and fairs, and churches,\nand other public amusements go on.” I am afraid the\nremark is too honest, and comes from the same origin\nas the maxim of the tyrant, “If you would rule the\nworld quietly, you must keep it amused.” I notice too\nthat the ground on which eminent public servants urge\nthe claims of popular education is fear; ’This country\nis filling up with thousands and millions of voters,\nand you must educate them to keep them from our throats.’\nWe do not believe that any education, any system of\nphilosophy, any influence of genius, will ever give\ndepth of insight to a superficial mind. Having settled\nourselves into this infidelity, our skill is expended\nto procure alleviations, diversion, opiates. We adorn\nthe victim with manual skill, his tongue with languages,\nhis body with inoffensive and comely manners. So have we\ncunningly hid the tragedy of limitation and inner death\nwe cannot avert. Is it strange that society should be\ndevoured by a secret melancholy which breaks through all\nits smiles and all its gayety and games?",
        "But even one step farther our infidelity has gone.\nIt appears that some doubt is felt by good and wise\nmen whether really the happiness and probity of men\nis increased by the culture of the mind in those\ndisciplines to which we give the name of education.\nUnhappily too the doubt comes from scholars, from\npersons who have tried these methods. In their\nexperience the scholar was not raised by the sacred\nthoughts amongst which he dwelt, but used them to\nselfish ends. He was a profane person, and became a\nshowman, turning his gifts to a marketable use, and\nnot to his own sustenance and growth. It was found\nthat the intellect could be independently developed,\nthat is, in separation from the man, as any single\norgan can be invigorated, and the result was monstrous.\nA canine appetite for knowledge was generated, which\nmust still be fed but was never satisfied, and this\nknowledge, not being directed on action, never took\nthe character of substantial, humane truth, blessing\nthose whom it entered. It gave the scholar certain\npowers of expression, the power of speech, the power\nof poetry, of literary art, but it did not bring him\nto peace or to beneficence.",
        "When the literary class betray a destitution of\nfaith, it is not strange that society should be\ndisheartened and sensualized by unbelief. What\nremedy? Life must be lived on a higher plane. We\nmust go up to a higher platform, to which we are\nalways invited to ascend; there, the whole aspect\nof things changes.  I resist the skepticism of our\neducation and of our educated men. I do not believe\nthat the differences of opinion and character in\nmen are organic. I do not recognize, beside the\nclass of the good and the wise, a permanent class of\nskeptics, or a class of conservatives, or of malignants,\nor of materialists. I do not believe in two classes.\nYou remember the story of the poor woman who importuned\nKing Philip of Macedon to grant her justice, which\nPhilip refused: the woman exclaimed, “I appeal:” the\nking, astonished, asked to whom she appealed: the woman\nreplied, “From Philip drunk to Philip sober.”  The text\nwill suit me very well. I believe not in two classes\nof men, but in man in two moods, in Philip drunk and\nPhilip sober. I think, according to the good-hearted\nword of Plato, “Unwillingly the soul is deprived of\ntruth.” Iron conservative, miser, or thief, no man is\nbut by a supposed necessity which he tolerates by\nshortness or torpidity of sight. The soul lets no man\ngo without some visitations and holydays of a diviner\npresence. It would be easy to show, by a narrow scanning\nof any man’s biography, that we are not so wedded to our\npaltry performances of every kind but that every man\nhas at intervals the grace to scorn his performances,\nin comparing them with his belief of what he should do;\n—that he puts himself on the side of his enemies,\nlistening gladly to what they say of him, and accusing\nhimself of the same things.",
        "What is it men love in Genius, but its infinite\nhope, which degrades all it has done?  Genius\ncounts all its miracles poor and short. Its own\nidea it never executed. The Iliad, the Hamlet,\nthe Doric column, the Roman arch, the Gothic minster,\nthe German anthem, when they are ended, the master\ncasts behind him. How sinks the song in the waves\nof melody which the universe pours over his soul!\nBefore that gracious Infinite out of which he drew\nthese few strokes, how mean they look, though the\npraises of the world attend them. From the triumphs\nof his art he turns with desire to this greater\ndefeat. Let those admire who will. With silent joy\nhe sees himself to be capable of a beauty that\neclipses all which his hands have done; all which\nhuman hands have ever done.",
        "Well, we are all the children of genius, the\nchildren of virtue,—and feel their inspirations\nin our happier hours. Is not every man sometimes\na radical in politics? Men are conservatives when\nthey are least vigorous, or when they are most\nluxurious. They are conservatives after dinner,\nor before taking their rest; when they are sick,\nor aged: in the morning, or when their intellect\nor their conscience has been aroused; when they\nhear music, or when they read poetry, they are\nradicals. In the circle of the rankest tories that\ncould be collected in England, Old or New, let a\npowerful and stimulating intellect, a man of great\nheart and mind, act on them, and very quickly these\nfrozen conservators will yield to the friendly\ninfluence, these hopeless will begin to hope, these\nhaters will begin to love, these immovable statues\nwill begin to spin and revolve. I cannot help\nrecalling the fine anecdote which Warton relates of\nBishop Berkeley, when he was preparing to leave\nEngland with his plan of planting the gospel among\nthe American savages. “Lord Bathurst told me that\nthe members of the Scriblerus club being met at his\nhouse at dinner, they agreed to rally Berkeley, who\nwas also his guest, on his scheme at Bermudas.\nBerkeley, having listened to the many lively things\nthey had to say, begged to be heard in his turn, and\ndisplayed his plan with such an astonishing and\nanimating force of eloquence and enthusiasm, that\nthey were struck dumb, and, after some pause, rose\nup all together with earnestness, exclaiming, ’Let\nus set out with him immediately.’”  Men in all ways\nare better than they seem. They like flattery for the\nmoment, but they know the truth for their own. It is\na foolish cowardice which keeps us from trusting them\nand speaking to them rude truth. They resent your\nhonesty for an instant, they will thank you for it\nalways. What is it we heartily wish of each other? Is\nit to be pleased and flattered? No, but to be convicted\nand exposed, to be shamed out of our nonsense of all\nkinds, and made men of, instead of ghosts and phantoms.\nWe are weary of gliding ghostlike through the world,\nwhich is itself so slight and unreal. We crave a sense\nof reality, though it come in strokes of pain. I explain\nso,—by this manlike love of truth,—those excesses and\nerrors into which souls of great vigor, but not equal\ninsight, often fall. They feel the poverty at the bottom\nof all the seeming affluence of the world.  They know\nthe speed with which they come straight through the thin\nmasquerade, and conceive a disgust at the indigence of\nnature: Rousseau, Mirabeau, Charles Fox, Napoleon, Byron,\n—and I could easily add names nearer home, of raging\nriders, who drive their steeds so hard, in the violence\nof living to forget its illusion: they would know the\nworst, and tread the floors of hell. The heroes of\nancient and modern fame, Cimon, Themistocles, Alcibiades,\nAlexander, Caesar, have treated life and fortune as a\ngame to be well and skilfully played, but the stake not\nto be so valued but that any time it could be held as a\ntrifle light as air, and thrown up.  Caesar, just before\nthe battle of Pharsalia, discourses with the Egyptian\npriest concerning the fountains of the Nile, and offers\nto quit the army, the empire, and Cleopatra, if he will\nshow him those mysterious sources.",
        "The same magnanimity shows itself in our social\nrelations, in the preference, namely, which each\nman gives to the society of superiors over that\nof his equals. All that a man has will he give for\nright relations with his mates. All that he has\nwill he give for an erect demeanor in every company\nand on each occasion. He aims at such things as his\nneighbors prize, and gives his days and nights, his\ntalents and his heart, to strike a good stroke, to\nacquit himself in all men’s sight as a man. The\nconsideration of an eminent citizen, of a noted\nmerchant, of a man of mark in his profession; a naval\nand military honor, a general’s commission, a marshal’s\nbaton, a ducal coronet, the laurel of poets, and,\nanyhow procured, the acknowledgment of eminent merit,\n—have this lustre for each candidate that they enable\nhim to walk erect and unashamed in the presence of some\npersons before whom he felt himself inferior. Having\nraised himself to this rank, having established his\nequality with class after class of those with whom\nhe would live well, he still finds certain others\nbefore whom he cannot possess himself, because they\nhave somewhat fairer, somewhat grander, somewhat purer,\nwhich extorts homage of him. Is his ambition pure? then\nwill his laurels and his possessions seem worthless:\ninstead of avoiding these men who make his fine gold\ndim, he will cast all behind him and seek their society\nonly, woo and embrace this his humiliation and\nmortification, until he shall know why his eye sinks,\nhis voice is husky, and his brilliant talents are\nparalyzed in this presence. He is sure that the soul\nwhich gives the lie to all things will tell none. His\nconstitution will not mislead him. If it cannot carry\nitself as it ought, high and unmatchable in the presence\nof any man; if the secret oracles whose whisper makes\nthe sweetness and dignity of his life do here withdraw\nand accompany him no longer,—it is time to undervalue\nwhat he has valued, to dispossess himself of what he has\nacquired, and with Caesar to take in his hand the army,\nthe empire, and Cleopatra, and say, “All these will I\nrelinquish, if you will show me the fountains of the\nNile.” Dear to us are those who love us; the swift\nmoments we spend with them are a compensation for a great\ndeal of misery; they enlarge our life;—but dearer are\nthose who reject us as unworthy, for they add another\nlife: they build a heaven before us whereof we had not\ndreamed, and thereby supply to us new powers out of the\nrecesses of the spirit, and urge us to new and unattempted\nperformances.",
        "As every man at heart wishes the best and not\ninferior society, wishes to be convicted of his\nerror and to come to himself,—so he wishes that\nthe same healing should not stop in his thought,\nbut should penetrate his will or active power.\nThe selfish man suffers more from his selfishness\nthan he from whom that selfishness withholds some\nimportant benefit. What he most wishes is to be\nlifted to some higher platform, that he may see\nbeyond his present fear the transalpine good, so\nthat his fear, his coldness, his custom may be\nbroken up like fragments of ice, melted and carried\naway in the great stream of good will. Do you ask\nmy aid? I also wish to be a benefactor. I wish more\nto be a benefactor and servant than you wish to be\nserved by me; and surely the greatest good fortune\nthat could befall me is precisely to be so moved by\nyou that I should say, ’Take me and all mine, and\nuse me and mine freely to your ends’! for I could\nnot say it otherwise than because a great enlargement\nhad come to my heart and mind, which made me superior\nto my fortunes.  Here we are paralyzed with fear; we\nhold on to our little properties, house and land,\noffice and money, for the bread which they have in\nour experience yielded us, although we confess that\nour being does not flow through them. We desire to be\nmade great; we desire to be touched with that fire\nwhich shall command this ice to stream, and make our\nexistence a benefit. If therefore we start objections\nto your project, O friend of the slave, or friend of\nthe poor, or of the race, understand well that it is\nbecause we wish to drive you to drive us into your\nmeasures. We wish to hear ourselves confuted. We are\nhaunted with a belief that you have a secret which it\nwould highliest advantage us to learn, and we would\nforce you to impart it to us, though it should bring\nus to prison, or to worse extremity.",
        "Nothing shall warp me from the belief that every\nman is a lover of truth. There is no pure lie, no\npure malignity in nature. The entertainment of the\nproposition of depravity is the last profligacy\nand profanation. There is no skepticism, no atheism\nbut that. Could it be received into common belief,\nsuicide would unpeople the planet.  It has had a name\nto live in some dogmatic theology, but each man’s\ninnocence and his real liking of his neighbor have\nkept it a dead letter. I remember standing at the\npolls one day when the anger of the political contest\ngave a certain grimness to the faces of the independent\nelectors, and a good man at my side, looking on the\npeople, remarked, “I am satisfied that the largest\npart of these men, on either side, mean to vote right.\"\nI suppose considerate observers, looking at the masses\nof men in their blameless and in their equivocal actions,\nwill assent, that in spite of selfishness and frivolity,\nthe general purpose in the great number of persons is\nfidelity. The reason why any one refuses his assent to\nyour opinion, or his aid to your benevolent design, is\nin you: he refuses to accept you as a bringer of truth,\nbecause, though you think you have it, he feels that\nyou have it not. You have not given him the authentic\nsign.",
        "If it were worth while to run into details this\ngeneral doctrine of the latent but ever soliciting\nSpirit, it would be easy to adduce illustration in\nparticulars of a man’s equality to the Church, of\nhis equality to the State, and of his equality to\nevery other man. It is yet in all men’s memory that,\na few years ago, the liberal churches complained\nthat the Calvinistic church denied to them the name\nof Christian. I think the complaint was confession:\na religious church would not complain. A religious\nman like Behmen, Fox, or Swedenborg is not irritated\nby wanting the sanction of the Church, but the Church\nfeels the accusation of his presence and belief.",
        "It only needs that a just man should walk in our\nstreets to make it appear how pitiful and inartificial\na contrivance is our legislation. The man whose part\nis taken and who does not wait for society in anything,\nhas a power which society cannot choose but feel. The\nfamiliar experiment called the hydrostatic paradox, in\nwhich a capillary column of water balances the ocean,\nis a symbol of the relation of one man to the whole\nfamily of men. The wise Dandamis, on hearing the lives\nof Socrates, Pythagoras and Diogenes read, “judged them\nto be great men every way, excepting, that they were\ntoo much subjected to the reverence of the laws, which\nto second and authorize, true virtue must abate very\nmuch of its original vigor.”",
        "And as a man is equal to the Church and equal to\nthe State, so he is equal to every other man. The\ndisparities of power in men are superficial; and\nall frank and searching conversation, in which a\nman lays himself open to his brother, apprises each\nof their radical unity. When two persons sit and\nconverse in a thoroughly good understanding, the\nremark is sure to be made, See how we have disputed\nabout words! Let a clear, apprehensive mind, such\nas every man knows among his friends, converse with\nthe most commanding poetic genius, I think it would\nappear that there was no inequality such as men\nfancy, between them; that a perfect understanding,\na like receiving, a like perceiving, abolished\ndifferences; and the poet would confess that his\ncreative imagination gave him no deep advantage,\nbut only the superficial one that he could express\nhimself and the other could not; that his advantage\nwas a knack, which might impose on indolent men but\ncould not impose on lovers of truth; for they know\nthe tax of talent, or what a price of greatness the\npower of expression too often pays. I believe it is\nthe conviction of the purest men, that the net amount\nof man and man does not much vary. Each is incomparably\nsuperior to his companion in some faculty. His want of\nskill in other directions has added to his fitness for\nhis own work. Each seems to have some compensation\nyielded to him by his infirmity, and every hindrance\noperates as a concentration of his force.",
        "These and the like experiences intimate that man\nstands in strict connection with a higher fact never\nyet manifested. There is power over and behind us,\nand we are the channels of its communications. We\nseek to say thus and so, and over our head some\nspirit sits which contradicts what we say. We would\npersuade our fellow to this or that; another self\nwithin our eyes dissuades him. That which we keep\nback, this reveals. In vain we compose our faces and\nour words; it holds uncontrollable communication with\nthe enemy, and he answers civilly to us, but believes\nthe spirit. We exclaim, ’There’s a traitor in the\nhouse!’ but at last it appears that he is the true\nman, and I am the traitor.  This open channel to the\nhighest life is the first and last reality, so subtle,\nso quiet, yet so tenacious, that although I have never\nexpressed the truth, and although I have never heard\nthe expression of it from any other, I know that the\nwhole truth is here for me.  What if I cannot answer\nyour questions? I am not pained that I cannot frame a\nreply to the question, What is the operation we call\nProvidence? There lies the unspoken thing, present,\nomnipresent.  Every time we converse we seek to\ntranslate it into speech, but whether we hit or whether\nwe miss, we have the fact. Every discourse is an\napproximate answer: but it is of small consequence\nthat we do not get it into verbs and nouns, whilst it\nabides for contemplation forever.",
        "If the auguries of the prophesying heart shall make\nthemselves good in time, the man who shall be born,\nwhose advent men and events prepare and foreshow,\nis one who shall enjoy his connection with a higher\nlife, with the man within man; shall destroy distrust\nby his trust, shall use his native but forgotten\nmethods, shall not take counsel of flesh and blood,\nbut shall rely on the Law alive and beautiful which\nworks over our heads and under our feet. Pitiless,\nit avails itself of our success when we obey it, and\nof our ruin when we contravene it. Men are all secret\nbelievers in it, else the word justice would have no\nmeaning: they believe that the best is the true; that\nright is done at last; or chaos would come. It rewards\nactions after their nature, and not after the design\nof the agent. ’Work,’ it saith to man, ’in every hour,\npaid or unpaid, see only that thou work, and thou canst\nnot escape the reward: whether thy work be fine or\ncoarse, planting corn or writing epics, so only it be\nhonest work, done to thine own approbation, it shall\nearn a reward to the senses as well as to the thought:\nno matter how often defeated, you are born to victory.\nThe reward of a thing well done, is to have done it.’",
        "As soon as a man is wonted to look beyond surfaces,\nand to see how this high will prevails without an\nexception or an interval, he settles himself into\nserenity. He can already rely on the laws of gravity,\nthat every stone will fall where it is due; the good\nglobe is faithful, and carries us securely through\nthe celestial spaces, anxious or resigned, we need\nnot interfere to help it on: and he will learn one\nday the mild lesson they teach, that our own orbit\nis all our task, and we need not assist the\nadministration of the universe. Do not be so impatient\nto set the town right concerning the unfounded\npretensions and the false reputation of certain men\nof standing. They are laboring harder to set the town\nright concerning themselves, and will certainly succeed.\nSuppress for a few days your criticism on the\ninsufficiency of this or that teacher or experimenter,\nand he will have demonstrated his insufficiency to all\nmen’s eyes. In like manner, let a man fall into the\ndivine circuits, and he is enlarged. Obedience to his\ngenius is the only liberating influence. We wish to\nescape from subjection and a sense of inferiority, and\nwe make self-denying ordinances, we drink water, we eat\ngrass, we refuse the laws, we go to jail: it is all in\nvain; only by obedience to his genius, only by the\nfreest activity in the way constitutional to him, does\nan angel seem to arise before a man and lead him by the\nhand out of all the wards of the prison.",
        "That which befits us, embosomed in beauty and wonder\nas we are, is cheerfulness and courage, and the endeavor\nto realize our aspirations. The life of man is the true\nromance, which when it is valiantly conducted will yield\nthe imagination a higher joy than any fiction. All around\nus what powers are wrapped up under the coarse mattings\nof custom, and all wonder prevented. It is so wonderful\nto our neurologists that a man can see without his eyes,\nthat it does not occur to them that it is just as\nwonderful that he should see with them; and that is ever\nthe difference between the wise and the unwise: the\nlatter wonders at what is unusual, the wise man wonders\nat the usual. Shall not the heart which has received so\nmuch, trust the Power by which it lives? May it not quit\nother leadings, and listen to the Soul that has guided\nit so gently and taught it so much, secure that the\nfuture will be worthy of the past?",
