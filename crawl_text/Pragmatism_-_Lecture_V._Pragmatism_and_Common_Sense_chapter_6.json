        "In the last lecture we turned ourselves from the usual way of\ntalking of the universe’s oneness as a principle, sublime in all its\nblankness, towards a study of the special kinds of union which the\nuniverse enfolds. We found many of these to coexist with kinds of\nseparation equally real. “How far am I verified?” is the question\nwhich each kind of union and each kind of separation asks us here,\nso as good pragmatists we have to turn our face towards experience,\ntowards ’facts.’",
        "Absolute oneness remains, but only as an hypothesis, and that\nhypothesis is reduced nowadays to that of an omniscient knower who\nsees all things without exception as forming one single systematic\nfact. But the knower in question may still be conceived either as an\nAbsolute or as an Ultimate; and over against the hypothesis of him\nin either form the counter-hypothesis that the widest field of\nknowledge that ever was or will be still contains some ignorance,\nmay be legitimately held. Some bits of information always may\nescape.",
        "This is the hypothesis of NOETIC PLURALISM, which monists consider\nso absurd. Since we are bound to treat it as respectfully as noetic\nmonism, until the facts shall have tipped the beam, we find that our\npragmatism, tho originally nothing but a method, has forced us to be\nfriendly to the pluralistic view. It MAY be that some parts of the\nworld are connected so loosely with some other parts as to be strung\nalong by nothing but the copula AND. They might even come and go\nwithout those other parts suffering any internal change. This\npluralistic view, of a world of ADDITIVE constitution, is one that\npragmatism is unable to rule out from serious consideration. But\nthis view leads one to the farther hypothesis that the actual world,\ninstead of being complete ’eternally,’ as the monists assure us, may\nbe eternally incomplete, and at all times subject to addition or\nliable to loss.",
        "It IS at any rate incomplete in one respect, and flagrantly so. The\nvery fact that we debate this question shows that our KNOWLEDGE is\nincomplete at present and subject to addition. In respect of the\nknowledge it contains the world does genuinely change and grow. Some\ngeneral remarks on the way in which our knowledge completes itself–\nwhen it does complete itself–will lead us very conveniently into\nour subject for this lecture, which is ’Common Sense.’",
        "To begin with, our knowledge grows IN SPOTS. The spots may be large\nor small, but the knowledge never grows all over: some old knowledge\nalways remains what it was. Your knowledge of pragmatism, let us\nsuppose, is growing now. Later, its growth may involve considerable\nmodification of opinions which you previously held to be true. But\nsuch modifications are apt to be gradual. To take the nearest\npossible example, consider these lectures of mine. What you first\ngain from them is probably a small amount of new information, a few\nnew definitions, or distinctions, or points of view. But while these\nspecial ideas are being added, the rest of your knowledge stands\nstill, and only gradually will you ’line up’ your previous opinions\nwith the novelties I am trying to instil, and modify to some slight\ndegree their mass.",
        "You listen to me now, I suppose, with certain prepossessions as to\nmy competency, and these affect your reception of what I say, but\nwere I suddenly to break off lecturing, and to begin to sing ’We\nwon’t go home till morning’ in a rich baritone voice, not only would\nthat new fact be added to your stock, but it would oblige you to\ndefine me differently, and that might alter your opinion of the\npragmatic philosophy, and in general bring about a rearrangement of\na number of your ideas. Your mind in such processes is strained, and\nsometimes painfully so, between its older beliefs and the novelties\nwhich experience brings along.",
        "Our minds thus grow in spots; and like grease-spots, the spots\nspread. But we let them spread as little as possible: we keep\nunaltered as much of our old knowledge, as many of our old\nprejudices and beliefs, as we can. We patch and tinker more than we\nrenew. The novelty soaks in; it stains the ancient mass; but it is\nalso tinged by what absorbs it. Our past apperceives and co-\noperates; and in the new equilibrium in which each step forward in\nthe process of learning terminates, it happens relatively seldom\nthat the new fact is added RAW. More usually it is embedded cooked,\nas one might say, or stewed down in the sauce of the old.",
        "New truths thus are resultants of new experiences and of old truths\ncombined and mutually modifying one another. And since this is the\ncase in the changes of opinion of to-day, there is no reason to\nassume that it has not been so at all times. It follows that very\nancient modes of thought may have survived through all the later\nchanges in men’s opinions. The most primitive ways of thinking may\nnot yet be wholly expunged. Like our five fingers, our ear-bones,\nour rudimentary caudal appendage, or our other ’vestigial’\npeculiarities, they may remain as indelible tokens of events in our\nrace-history. Our ancestors may at certain moments have struck into\nways of thinking which they might conceivably not have found. But\nonce they did so, and after the fact, the inheritance continues.\nWhen you begin a piece of music in a certain key, you must keep the\nkey to the end. You may alter your house ad libitum, but the ground-\nplan of the first architect persists–you can make great changes,\nbut you cannot change a Gothic church into a Doric temple. You may\nrinse and rinse the bottle, but you can’t get the taste of the\nmedicine or whiskey that first filled it wholly out.",
        "My thesis now is this, that OUR FUNDAMENTAL WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT\nTHINGS ARE DISCOVERIES OF EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE ANCESTORS, WHICH HAVE\nBEEN ABLE TO PRESERVE THEMSELVES THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL\nSUBSEQUENT TIME. They form one great stage of equilibrium in the\nhuman mind’s development, the stage of common sense. Other stages\nhave grafted themselves upon this stage, but have never succeeded in\ndisplacing it. Let us consider this common-sense stage first, as if\nit might be final.",
        "In practical talk, a man’s common sense means his good judgment, his\nfreedom from excentricity, his GUMPTION, to use the vernacular word.\nIn philosophy it means something entirely different, it means his\nuse of certain intellectual forms or categories of thought. Were we\nlobsters, or bees, it might be that our organization would have led\nto our using quite different modes from these of apprehending our\nexperiences. It MIGHT be too (we cannot dogmatically deny this) that\nsuch categories, unimaginable by us to-day, would have proved on the\nwhole as serviceable for handling our experiences mentally as those\nwhich we actually use.",
        "If this sounds paradoxical to anyone, let him think of analytical\ngeometry. The identical figures which Euclid defined by intrinsic\nrelations were defined by Descartes by the relations of their points\nto adventitious co-ordinates, the result being an absolutely\ndifferent and vastly more potent way of handling curves. All our\nconceptions are what the Germans call denkmittel, means by which we\nhandle facts by thinking them. Experience merely as such doesn’t\ncome ticketed and labeled, we have first to discover what it is.\nKant speaks of it as being in its first intention a gewuehl der\nerscheinungen, a rhapsodie der wahrnehmungen, a mere motley which we\nhave to unify by our wits. What we usually do is first to frame some\nsystem of concepts mentally classified, serialized, or connected in\nsome intellectual way, and then to use this as a tally by which we\n’keep tab’ on the impressions that present themselves. When each is\nreferred to some possible place in the conceptual system, it is\nthereby ’understood.’ This notion of parallel ’manifolds’ with their\nelements standing reciprocally in ’one-to-one relations,’ is proving\nso convenient nowadays in mathematics and logic as to supersede more\nand more the older classificatory conceptions. There are many\nconceptual systems of this sort; and the sense manifold is also such\na system. Find a one-to-one relation for your sense-impressions\nANYWHERE among the concepts, and in so far forth you rationalize the\nimpressions. But obviously you can rationalize them by using various\nconceptual systems.",
        "The old common-sense way of rationalizing them is by a set of\nconcepts of which the most important are these:",
        "Thing;",
        "The same or different;",
        "Kinds;",
        "Minds;",
        "Bodies;",
        "One Time;",
        "One Space;",
        "Subjects and attributes;",
        "Causal influences;",
        "The fancied;",
        "The real.",
        "We are now so familiar with the order that these notions have woven\nfor us out of the everlasting weather of our perceptions that we\nfind it hard to realize how little of a fixed routine the\nperceptions follow when taken by themselves. The word weather is a\ngood one to use here. In Boston, for example, the weather has almost\nno routine, the only law being that if you have had any weather for\ntwo days, you will probably but not certainly have another weather\non the third. Weather-experience as it thus comes to Boston, is\ndiscontinuous and chaotic. In point of temperature, of wind, rain or\nsunshine, it MAY change three times a day. But the Washington\nweather-bureau intellectualizes this disorder by making each\nsuccessive bit of Boston weather EPISODIC. It refers it to its place\nand moment in a continental cyclone, on the history of which the\nlocal changes everywhere are strung as beads are strung upon a cord.",
        "Now it seems almost certain that young children and the inferior\nanimals take all their experiences very much as uninstructed\nBostonians take their weather. They know no more of time or space as\nworld-receptacles, or of permanent subjects and changing predicates,\nor of causes, or kinds, or thoughts, or things, than our common\npeople know of continental cyclones. A baby’s rattle drops out of\nhis hand, but the baby looks not for it. It has ’gone out’ for him,\nas a candle-flame goes out; and it comes back, when you replace it\nin his hand, as the flame comes back when relit. The idea of its\nbeing a ’thing,’ whose permanent existence by itself he might\ninterpolate between its successive apparitions has evidently not\noccurred to him. It is the same with dogs. Out of sight, out of\nmind, with them. It is pretty evident that they have no GENERAL\ntendency to interpolate ’things.’ Let me quote here a passage from\nmy colleague G. Santayana’s book.",
        "“If a dog, while sniffing about contentedly, sees afar off his\nmaster arriving after long absence...the poor brute asks for no\nreason why his master went, why he has come again, why he should be\nloved, or why presently while lying at his feet you forget him and\nbegin to grunt and dream of the chase–all that is an utter mystery,\nutterly unconsidered. Such experience has variety, scenery, and a\ncertain vital rhythm; its story might be told in dithyrambic verse.\nIt moves wholly by inspiration; every event is providential, every\nact unpremeditated. Absolute freedom and absolute helplessness have\nmet together: you depend wholly on divine favour, yet that\nunfathomable agency is not distinguishable from your own life.\n...[But] the figures even of that disordered drama have their exits\nand their entrances; and their cues can be gradually discovered by a\nbeing capable of fixing his attention and retaining the order of\nevents. ...In proportion as such understanding advances each moment\nof experience becomes consequential and prophetic of the rest. The\ncalm places in life are filled with power and its spasms with\nresource. No emotion can overwhelm the mind, for of none is the\nbasis or issue wholly hidden; no event can disconcert it altogether,\nbecause it sees beyond. Means can be looked for to escape from the\nworst predicament; and whereas each moment had been formerly filled\nwith nothing but its own adventure and surprised emotion, each now\nmakes room for the lesson of what went before and surmises what may\nbe the plot of the whole.\"[Footnote: The Life of Reason: Reason in\nCommon Sense, 1905, p. 59.]",
        "Even to-day science and philosophy are still laboriously trying to\npart fancies from realities in our experience; and in primitive\ntimes they made only the most incipient distinctions in this line.\nMen believed whatever they thought with any liveliness, and they\nmixed their dreams with their realities inextricably. The categories\nof ’thought’ and ’things’ are indispensable here–instead of being\nrealities we now call certain experiences only ’thoughts.’ There is\nnot a category, among those enumerated, of which we may not imagine\nthe use to have thus originated historically and only gradually\nspread.",
        "That one Time which we all believe in and in which each event has\nits definite date, that one Space in which each thing has its\nposition, these abstract notions unify the world incomparably; but\nin their finished shape as concepts how different they are from the\nloose unordered time-and-space experiences of natural men!\nEverything that happens to us brings its own duration and extension,\nand both are vaguely surrounded by a marginal ’more’ that runs into\nthe duration and extension of the next thing that comes. But we soon\nlose all our definite bearings; and not only do our children make no\ndistinction between yesterday and the day before yesterday, the\nwhole past being churned up together, but we adults still do so\nwhenever the times are large. It is the same with spaces. On a map I\ncan distinctly see the relation of London, Constantinople, and Pekin\nto the place where I am; in reality I utterly fail to FEEL the facts\nwhich the map symbolizes. The directions and distances are vague,\nconfused and mixed. Cosmic space and cosmic time, so far from being\nthe intuitions that Kant said they were, are constructions as\npatently artificial as any that science can show. The great majority\nof the human race never use these notions, but live in plural times\nand spaces, interpenetrant and DURCHEINANDER.",
        "Permanent ’things’ again; the ’same’ thing and its various\n’appearances’ and ’alterations’; the different ’kinds’ of thing;\nwith the ’kind’ used finally as a ’predicate,’ of which the thing\nremains the ’subject’–what a straightening of the tangle of our\nexperience’s immediate flux and sensible variety does this list of\nterms suggest! And it is only the smallest part of his experience’s\nflux that anyone actually does straighten out by applying to it\nthese conceptual instruments. Out of them all our lowest ancestors\nprobably used only, and then most vaguely and inaccurately, the\nnotion of ’the same again.’ But even then if you had asked them\nwhether the same were a ’thing’ that had endured throughout the\nunseen interval, they would probably have been at a loss, and would\nhave said that they had never asked that question, or considered\nmatters in that light.",
        "Kinds, and sameness of kind–what colossally useful DENKMITTEL for\nfinding our way among the many! The manyness might conceivably have\nbeen absolute. Experiences might have all been singulars, no one of\nthem occurring twice. In such a world logic would have had no\napplication; for kind and sameness of kind are logic’s only\ninstruments. Once we know that whatever is of a kind is also of that\nkind’s kind, we can travel through the universe as if with seven-\nleague boots. Brutes surely never use these abstractions, and\ncivilized men use them in most various amounts.",
        "Causal influence, again! This, if anything, seems to have been an\nantediluvian conception; for we find primitive men thinking that\nalmost everything is significant and can exert influence of some\nsort. The search for the more definite influences seems to have\nstarted in the question: “Who, or what, is to blame?\"–for any\nillness, namely, or disaster, or untoward thing. From this centre\nthe search for causal influences has spread. Hume and ’Science’\ntogether have tried to eliminate the whole notion of influence,\nsubstituting the entirely different DENKMITTEL of ’law.’ But law is\na comparatively recent invention, and influence reigns supreme in\nthe older realm of common sense.",
        "The ’possible,’ as something less than the actual and more than the\nwholly unreal, is another of these magisterial notions of common\nsense. Criticize them as you may, they persist; and we fly back to\nthem the moment critical pressure is relaxed. ’Self,’ ’body,’ in the\nsubstantial or metaphysical sense–no one escapes subjection to\nTHOSE forms of thought. In practice, the common-sense DENKMITTEL are\nuniformly victorious. Everyone, however instructed, still thinks of\na ’thing’ in the common-sense way, as a permanent unit-subject that\n’supports’ its attributes interchangeably. No one stably or\nsincerely uses the more critical notion, of a group of sense-\nqualities united by a law. With these categories in our hand, we\nmake our plans and plot together, and connect all the remoter parts\nof experience with what lies before our eyes. Our later and more\ncritical philosophies are mere fads and fancies compared with this\nnatural mother-tongue of thought.",
        "Common sense appears thus as a perfectly definite stage in our\nunderstanding of things, a stage that satisfies in an\nextraordinarily successful way the purposes for which we think.\n’Things’ do exist, even when we do not see them. Their ’kinds’ also\nexist. Their ’qualities’ are what they act by, and are what we act\non; and these also exist. These lamps shed their quality of light on\nevery object in this room. We intercept IT on its way whenever we\nhold up an opaque screen. It is the very sound that my lips emit\nthat travels into your ears. It is the sensible heat of the fire\nthat migrates into the water in which we boil an egg; and we can\nchange the heat into coolness by dropping in a lump of ice. At this\nstage of philosophy all non-European men without exception have\nremained. It suffices for all the necessary practical ends of life;\nand, among our own race even, it is only the highly sophisticated\nspecimens, the minds debauched by learning, as Berkeley calls them,\nwho have ever even suspected common sense of not being absolutely\ntrue.",
        "But when we look back, and speculate as to how the common-sense\ncategories may have achieved their wonderful supremacy, no reason\nappears why it may not have been by a process just like that by\nwhich the conceptions due to Democritus, Berkeley, or Darwin,\nachieved their similar triumphs in more recent times. In other\nwords, they may have been successfully DISCOVERED by prehistoric\ngeniuses whose names the night of antiquity has covered up; they may\nhave been verified by the immediate facts of experience which they\nfirst fitted; and then from fact to fact and from man to man they\nmay have SPREAD, until all language rested on them and we are now\nincapable of thinking naturally in any other terms. Such a view\nwould only follow the rule that has proved elsewhere so fertile, of\nassuming the vast and remote to conform to the laws of formation\nthat we can observe at work in the small and near.",
        "For all utilitarian practical purposes these conceptions amply\nsuffice; but that they began at special points of discovery and only\ngradually spread from one thing to another, seems proved by the\nexceedingly dubious limits of their application to-day. We assume\nfor certain purposes one ’objective’ Time that AEQUABILITER FLUIT,\nbut we don’t livingly believe in or realize any such equally-flowing\ntime. ’Space’ is a less vague notion; but ’things,’ what are they?\nIs a constellation properly a thing? or an army? or is an ENS\nRATIONIS such as space or justice a thing? Is a knife whose handle\nand blade are changed the ’same’? Is the ’changeling,’ whom Locke so\nseriously discusses, of the human ’kind’? Is ’telepathy’ a ’fancy’\nor a ’fact’? The moment you pass beyond the practical use of these\ncategories (a use usually suggested sufficiently by the\ncircumstances of the special case) to a merely curious or\nspeculative way of thinking, you find it impossible to say within\njust what limits of fact any one of them shall apply.",
        "The peripatetic philosophy, obeying rationalist propensities, has\ntried to eternalize the common-sense categories by treating them\nvery technically and articulately. A ’thing’ for instance is a\nbeing, or ENS. An ENS is a subject in which qualities ’inhere.’ A\nsubject is a substance. Substances are of kinds, and kinds are\ndefinite in number, and discrete. These distinctions are fundamental\nand eternal. As terms of DISCOURSE they are indeed magnificently\nuseful, but what they mean, apart from their use in steering our\ndiscourse to profitable issues, does not appear. If you ask a\nscholastic philosopher what a substance may be in itself, apart from\nits being the support of attributes, he simply says that your\nintellect knows perfectly what the word means.",
        "But what the intellect knows clearly is only the word itself and its\nsteering function. So it comes about that intellects SIBI PERMISSI,\nintellects only curious and idle, have forsaken the common-sense\nlevel for what in general terms may be called the ’critical’ level\nof thought. Not merely SUCH intellects either–your Humes and\nBerkeleys and Hegels; but practical observers of facts, your\nGalileos, Daltons, Faradays, have found it impossible to treat the\nNAIFS sense-termini of common sense as ultimately real. As common\nsense interpolates her constant ’things’ between our intermittent\nsensations, so science EXTRApolates her world of ’primary’\nqualities, her atoms, her ether, her magnetic fields, and the like,\nbeyond the common-sense world. The ’things’ are now invisible\nimpalpable things; and the old visible common-sense things are\nsupposed to result from the mixture of these invisibles. Or else the\nwhole NAIF conception of thing gets superseded, and a thing’s name\nis interpreted as denoting only the law or REGEL DER VERBINDUNG by\nwhich certain of our sensations habitually succeed or coexist.",
        "Science and critical philosophy thus burst the bounds of common\nsense. With science NAIF realism ceases: ’Secondary’ qualities\nbecome unreal; primary ones alone remain. With critical philosophy,\nhavoc is made of everything. The common-sense categories one and all\ncease to represent anything in the way of BEING; they are but\nsublime tricks of human thought, our ways of escaping bewilderment\nin the midst of sensation’s irremediable flow.",
        "But the scientific tendency in critical thought, tho inspired at\nfirst by purely intellectual motives, has opened an entirely\nunexpected range of practical utilities to our astonished view.\nGalileo gave us accurate clocks and accurate artillery-practice; the\nchemists flood us with new medicines and dye-stuffs; Ampere and\nFaraday have endowed us with the New York subway and with Marconi\ntelegrams. The hypothetical things that such men have invented,\ndefined as they have defined them, are showing an extraordinary\nfertility in consequences verifiable by sense. Our logic can deduce\nfrom them a consequence due under certain conditions, we can then\nbring about the conditions, and presto, the consequence is there\nbefore our eyes. The scope of the practical control of nature newly\nput into our hand by scientific ways of thinking vastly exceeds the\nscope of the old control grounded on common sense. Its rate of\nincrease accelerates so that no one can trace the limit; one may\neven fear that the BEING of man may be crushed by his own powers,\nthat his fixed nature as an organism may not prove adequate to stand\nthe strain of the ever increasingly tremendous functions, almost\ndivine creative functions, which his intellect will more and more\nenable him to wield. He may drown in his wealth like a child in a\nbath-tub, who has turned on the water and who cannot turn it off.",
        "The philosophic stage of criticism, much more thorough in its\nnegations than the scientific stage, so far gives us no new range of\npractical power. Locke, Hume, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, have all been\nutterly sterile, so far as shedding any light on the details of\nnature goes, and I can think of no invention or discovery that can\nbe directly traced to anything in their peculiar thought, for\nneither with Berkeley’s tar-water nor with Kant’s nebular hypothesis\nhad their respective philosophic tenets anything to do. The\nsatisfactions they yield to their disciples are intellectual, not\npractical; and even then we have to confess that there is a large\nminus-side to the account.",
        "There are thus at least three well-characterized levels, stages or\ntypes of thought about the world we live in, and the notions of one\nstage have one kind of merit, those of another stage another kind.\nIt is impossible, however, to say that any stage as yet in sight is\nabsolutely more TRUE than any other. Common sense is the more\nCONSOLIDATED stage, because it got its innings first, and made all\nlanguage into its ally. Whether it or science be the more AUGUST\nstage may be left to private judgment. But neither consolidation nor\naugustness are decisive marks of truth. If common sense were true,\nwhy should science have had to brand the secondary qualities, to\nwhich our world owes all its living interest, as false, and to\ninvent an invisible world of points and curves and mathematical\nequations instead? Why should it have needed to transform causes and\nactivities into laws of ’functional variation’? Vainly did\nscholasticism, common sense’s college-trained younger sister, seek\nto stereotype the forms the human family had always talked with, to\nmake them definite and fix them for eternity. Substantial forms (in\nother words our secondary qualities) hardly outlasted the year of\nour Lord 1600. People were already tired of them then; and Galileo,\nand Descartes, with his ’new philosophy,’ gave them only a little\nlater their coup de grace.",
        "But now if the new kinds of scientific ’thing,’ the corpuscular and\netheric world, were essentially more ’true,’ why should they have\nexcited so much criticism within the body of science itself?\nScientific logicians are saying on every hand that these entities\nand their determinations, however definitely conceived, should not\nbe held for literally real. It is AS IF they existed; but in reality\nthey are like co-ordinates or logarithms, only artificial short-cuts\nfor taking us from one part to another of experience’s flux. We can\ncipher fruitfully with them; they serve us wonderfully; but we must\nnot be their dupes.",
        "There is no RINGING conclusion possible when we compare these types\nof thinking, with a view to telling which is the more absolutely\ntrue. Their naturalness, their intellectual economy, their\nfruitfulness for practice, all start up as distinct tests of their\nveracity, and as a result we get confused. Common sense is BETTER\nfor one sphere of life, science for another, philosophic criticism\nfor a third; but whether either be TRUER absolutely, Heaven only\nknows. Just now, if I understand the matter rightly, we are\nwitnessing a curious reversion to the common-sense way of looking at\nphysical nature, in the philosophy of science favored by such men as\nMach, Ostwald and Duhem. According to these teachers no hypothesis\nis truer than any other in the sense of being a more literal copy of\nreality. They are all but ways of talking on our part, to be\ncompared solely from the point of view of their USE. The only\nliterally true thing is REALITY; and the only reality we know is,\nfor these logicians, sensible reality, the flux of our sensations\nand emotions as they pass. ’Energy’ is the collective name\n(according to Ostwald) for the sensations just as they present\nthemselves (the movement, heat, magnetic pull, or light, or whatever\nit may be) when they are measured in certain ways. So measuring\nthem, we are enabled to describe the correlated changes which they\nshow us, in formulas matchless for their simplicity and fruitfulness\nfor human use. They are sovereign triumphs of economy in thought.",
        "No one can fail to admire the ’energetic’ philosophy. But the\nhypersensible entities, the corpuscles and vibrations, hold their\nown with most physicists and chemists, in spite of its appeal. It\nseems too economical to be all-sufficient. Profusion, not economy,\nmay after all be reality’s key-note.",
        "I am dealing here with highly technical matters, hardly suitable for\npopular lecturing, and in which my own competence is small. All the\nbetter for my conclusion, however, which at this point is this. The\nwhole notion of truth, which naturally and without reflexion we\nassume to mean the simple duplication by the mind of a ready-made\nand given reality, proves hard to understand clearly. There is no\nsimple test available for adjudicating offhand between the divers\ntypes of thought that claim to possess it. Common sense, common\nscience or corpuscular philosophy, ultra-critical science, or\nenergetics, and critical or idealistic philosophy, all seem\ninsufficiently true in some regard and leave some dissatisfaction.\nIt is evident that the conflict of these so widely differing systems\nobliges us to overhaul the very idea of truth, for at present we\nhave no definite notion of what the word may mean. I shall face that\ntask in my next lecture, and will add but a few words, in finishing\nthe present one.",
        "There are only two points that I wish you to retain from the present\nlecture. The first one relates to common sense. We have seen reason\nto suspect it, to suspect that in spite of their being so venerable,\nof their being so universally used and built into the very structure\nof language, its categories may after all be only a collection of\nextraordinarily successful hypotheses (historically discovered or\ninvented by single men, but gradually communicated, and used by\neverybody) by which our forefathers have from time immemorial\nunified and straightened the discontinuity of their immediate\nexperiences, and put themselves into an equilibrium with the surface\nof nature so satisfactory for ordinary practical purposes that it\ncertainly would have lasted forever, but for the excessive\nintellectual vivacity of Democritus, Archimedes, Galileo, Berkeley,\nand other excentric geniuses whom the example of such men inflamed.\nRetain, I pray you, this suspicion about common sense.",
        "The other point is this. Ought not the existence of the various\ntypes of thinking which we have reviewed, each so splendid for\ncertain purposes, yet all conflicting still, and neither one of them\nable to support a claim of absolute veracity, to awaken a\npresumption favorable to the pragmatistic view that all our theories\nare INSTRUMENTAL, are mental modes of ADAPTATION to reality, rather\nthan revelations or gnostic answers to some divinely instituted\nworld-enigma? I expressed this view as clearly as I could in the\nsecond of these lectures. Certainly the restlessness of the actual\ntheoretic situation, the value for some purposes of each thought-\nlevel, and the inability of either to expel the others decisively,\nsuggest this pragmatistic view, which I hope that the next lectures\nmay soon make entirely convincing. May there not after all be a\npossible ambiguity in truth?",
