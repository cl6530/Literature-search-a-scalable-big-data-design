        "A CHAPTER OF ART",
        "WHEN a baby is perfectly healthy and has had enough to eat\nand has slept all it wants, then it hums a little tune to show how\nhappy it is. To grown-ups this humming means nothing. It\nsounds like “goo-zum, goo-zum, goo-o-o-o-o,” but to the baby\nit is perfect music. It is his first contribution to art.",
        "As soon as he (or she) gets a little older and is able to sit\nup, the period of mud-pie making begins. These mud-pies do\nnot interest the outside world. There are too many million\nbabies, making too many million mud-pies at the same time.\nBut to the small infant they represent another expedition into\nthe pleasant realm of art. The baby is now a sculptor.",
        "At the age of three or four, when the hands begin to obey\nthe brain, the child becomes a painter. His fond mother gives\nhim a box of coloured chalks and every loose bit of paper is\nrapidly covered with strange pothooks and scrawls which represent\nhouses and horses and terrible naval battles.",
        "Soon however this happiness of just “making things\"\ncomes to an end. School begins and the greater part of the\nday is filled up with work. The business of living, or rather\nthe business of “making a living,” becomes the most important\nevent in the life of every boy and girl. There is little time left\nfor “art” between learning the tables of multiplication and the\npast participles of the irregular French verbs. And unless\nthe desire for making certain things for the mere pleasure of\ncreating them without any hope of a practical return be very\nstrong, the child grows into manhood and forgets that the\nfirst five years of his life were mainly devoted to art.",
        "Nations are not different from children. As soon as the\ncave-man had escaped the threatening dangers of the long and\nshivering ice-period, and had put his house in order, he began\nto make certain things which he thought beautiful, although\nthey were of no earthly use to him in his fight with the wild\nanimals of the jungle. He covered the walls of his grotto with\npictures of the elephants and the deer which he hunted, and\nout of a piece of stone, he hacked the rough figures of those\nwomen he thought most attractive.",
        "As soon as the Egyptians and the Babylonians and the\nPersians and all the other people of the east had founded\ntheir little countries along the Nile and the Euphrates, they\nbegan to build magnificent palaces for their kings, invented\nbright pieces of jewellery for their women and planted gardens\nwhich sang happy songs of colour with their many bright flowers.",
        "Our own ancestors, the wandering nomads from the distant\nAsiatic prairies, enjoying a free and easy existence as\nfighters and hunters, composed songs which celebrated the\nmighty deeds of their great leaders and invented a form of\npoetry which has survived until our own day. A thousand years\nlater, when they had established themselves on the Greek mainland,\nand had built their “city-states,” they expressed their\njoy (and their sorrows) in magnificent temples, in statues, in\ncomedies and in tragedies, and in every conceivable form of\nart.",
        "The Romans, like their Carthaginian rivals, were too busy\nadministering other people and making money to have much\nlove for “useless and unprofitable” adventures of the spirit.\nThey conquered the world and built roads and bridges but they\nborrowed their art wholesale from the Greeks. They invented\ncertain practical forms of architecture which answered the\ndemands of their day and age. But their statues and their histories\nand their mosaics and their poems were mere Latin imi-\ntations of Greek originals. Without that vague and hard-to-\ndefine something which the world calls “personality,” there can\nbe no art and the Roman world distrusted that particular sort\nof personality. The Empire needed efficient soldiers and\ntradesmen. The business of writing poetry or making pictures\nwas left to foreigners.",
        "Then came the Dark Ages. The barbarian was the proverbial\nbull in the china-shop of western Europe. He had no use\nfor what he did not understand. Speaking in terms of the year\n1921, he liked the magazine covers of pretty ladies, but threw\nthe Rembrandt etchings which he had inherited into the ash-\ncan. Soon he came to learn better. Then he tried to undo the\ndamage which he had created a few years before. But the ash-\ncans were gone and so were the pictures.",
        "But by this time, his own art, which he had brought with\nhim from the east, had developed into something very beautiful\nand he made up for his past neglect and indifference by the so-\ncalled “art of the Middle Ages” which as far as northern Europe\nis concerned was a product of the Germanic mind and had\nborrowed but little from the Greeks and the Latins and nothing\nat all from the older forms of art of Egypt and Assyria, not\nto speak of India and China, which simply did not exist, as far\nas the people of that time were concerned. Indeed, so little\nhad the northern races been influenced by their southern neighbours\nthat their own architectural products were completely\nmisunderstood by the people of Italy and were treated by\nthem with downright and unmitigated contempt.",
        "You have all heard the word Gothic. You probably associate\nit with the picture of a lovely old cathedral, lifting its slender\nspires towards high heaven. But what does the word really\nmean?",
        "It means something “uncouth” and “barbaric\"–something\nwhich one might expect from an “uncivilised Goth,” a rough\nbackwoods-man who had no respect for the established rules of\nclassical art and who built his “modern horrors” to please his\nown low tastes without a decent regard for the examples of\nthe Forum and the Acropolis.",
        "And yet for several centuries this form of Gothic architecture\nwas the highest expression of the sincere feeling for art\nwhich inspired the whole northern continent. From a previous\nchapter, you will remember how the people of the late Middle\nAges lived. Unless they were peasants and dwelt in villages,\nthey were citizens of a “city” or “civitas,” the old Latin name\nfor a tribe. And indeed, behind their high walls and their deep\nmoats, these good burghers were true tribesmen who shared\nthe common dangers and enjoyed the common safety and prosperity\nwhich they derived from their system of mutual protection.",
        "In the old Greek and Roman cities the market-place, where\nthe temple stood, had been the centre of civic life. During\nthe Middle Ages, the Church, the House of God, became such a\ncentre. We modern Protestant people, who go to our church\nonly once a week, and then for a few hours only, hardly know\nwhat a mediaeval church meant to the community. Then, before\nyou were a week old, you were taken to the Church to be\nbaptised. As a child, you visited the Church to learn the holy\nstories of the Scriptures. Later on you became a member\nof the congregation, and if you were rich enough you built\nyourself a separate little chapel sacred to the memory of the\nPatron Saint of your own family. As for the sacred edifice,\nit was open at all hours of the day and many of the night. In\na certain sense it resembled a modern club, dedicated to all the\ninhabitants of the town. In the church you very likely caught\na first glimpse of the girl who was to become your bride at a\ngreat ceremony before the High Altar. And finally, when the\nend of the journey had come, you were buried beneath the\nstones of this familiar building, that all your children and their\ngrandchildren might pass over your grave until the Day of\nJudgement.",
        "Because the Church was not only the House of God but\nalso the true centre of all common life, the building had to be\ndifferent from anything that had ever been constructed by\nthe hands of man. The temples of the Egyptians and the\nGreeks and the Romans had been merely the shrine of a local\ndivinity. As no sermons were preached before the images of\nOsiris or Zeus or Jupiter, it was not necessary that the interior\noffer space for a great multitude. All the religious processions\nof the old Mediterranean peoples took place in the open. But\nin the north, where the weather was usually bad,\nmost functions were held under the roof of the church.",
        "During many centuries the architects struggled with\nthis problem of constructing a building that was large\nenough. The Roman tradition taught them how to build heavy\nstone walls with very small windows lest the walls lose\ntheir strength. On the top of this they then placed a\nheavy stone roof. But in the twelfth century, after the\nbeginning of the Crusades, when the architects had seen the\npointed arches of the Mohammedan builders, the western builders\ndiscovered a new style which gave them their first chance to make\nthe sort of building which those days of an intense religious\nlife demanded. And then they developed this strange style upon\nwhich the Italians bestowed the contemptuous name of “Gothic\"or barbaric.\nThey achieved their purpose by inventing a vaulted roof which\nwas supported by “ribs.” But such a roof, if it became\ntoo heavy, was apt to break the walls, just as a man\nof three hundred pounds sitting down upon a child’s chair\nwill force it to collapse. To overcome this difficulty, certain\nFrench architects then began to re-enforce the walls with\n“buttresses” which were merely heavy masses of stone against\nwhich the walls could lean while they supported the roof. And\nto assure the further safety of the roof they supported the ribs\nof the roof by so-called “flying buttresses,” a very simple\nmethod of construction which you will understand at once when\nyou look at our picture.",
        "This new method of construction allowed the introduction\nof enormous windows. In the twelfth century, glass was still\nan expensive curiosity, and very few private buildings possessed\nglass windows. Even the castles of the nobles were\nwithout protection and this accounts for the eternal drafts\nand explains why people of that day wore furs in-doors as\nwell as out.",
        "Fortunately, the art of making coloured glass, with which\nthe ancient people of the Mediterranean had been familiar,\nhad not been entirely lost. There was a revival of stained\nglass-making and soon the windows of the Gothic churches\ntold the stories of the Holy Book in little bits of brilliantly\ncoloured window-pane, which were caught in a long framework\nof lead.",
        "Behold, therefore, the new and glorious house of God,\nfilled with an eager multitude, “living” its religion as no people\nhave ever done either before or since! Nothing is considered\ntoo good or too costly or too wondrous for this House of God\nand Home of Man. The sculptors, who since the destruction\nof the Roman Empire have been out of employment, haltingly\nreturn to their noble art. Portals and pillars and buttresses\nand cornices are all covered with carven images of Our Lord\nand the blessed Saints. The embroiderers too are set to work\nto make tapestries for the walls. The jewellers offer their\nhighest art that the shrine of the altar may be worthy of complete\nadoration. Even the painter does his best. Poor man,\nhe is greatly handicapped by lack of a suitable medium.",
        "And thereby hangs a story.",
        "The Romans of the early Christian period had covered the\nfloors and the walls of their temples and houses with mosaics;\npictures made of coloured bits of glass. But this art had been\nexceedingly difficult. It gave the painter no chance to express\nall he wanted to say, as all children know who have ever tried to\nmake figures out of coloured blocks of wood. The art of\nmosaic painting therefore died out during the late Middle\nAges except in Russia, where the Byzantine mosaic painters\nhad found a refuge after the fall of Constantinople and continued\nto ornament the walls of the orthodox churches until\nthe day of the Bolsheviki, when there was an end to the building\nof churches.",
        "Of course, the mediaeval painter could mix his colours with\nthe water of the wet plaster which was put upon the walls of\nthe churches. This method of painting upon “fresh plaster\"\n(which was generally called “fresco” or “fresh” painting)\nwas very popular for many centuries. To-day, it is as rare\nas the art of painting miniatures in manuscripts and among\nthe hundreds of artists of our modern cities there is perhaps\none who can handle this medium successfully. But during the\nMiddle Ages there was no other way and the artists were\n“fresco” workers for lack of something better. The method\nhowever had certain great disadvantages. Very often the\nplaster came off the walls after only a few years, or dampness\nspoiled the pictures, just as dampness will spoil the pattern\nof our wall paper. People tried every imaginable expedient\nto get away from this plaster background. They tried to mix\ntheir colours with wine and vinegar and with honey and with\nthe sticky white of egg, but none of these methods were satisfactory.\nFor more than a thousand years these experiments\ncontinued. In painting pictures upon the parchment leaves\nof manuscripts the mediaeval artists were very successful. But\nwhen it came to covering large spaces of wood or stone with\npaint which would stick, they did not succeed very well.",
        "At last, during the first half of the fifteenth century, the\nproblem was solved in the southern Netherlands by Jan and\nHubert van Eyck. The famous Flemish brothers mixed their\npaint with specially prepared oils and this allowed them to use\nwood and canvas or stone or anything else as a background for\ntheir pictures.",
        "But by this time the religious ardour of the early Middle\nAges was a thing of the past. The rich burghers of the cities\nwere succeeding the bishops as patrons of the arts. And as\nart invariably follows the full dinner-pail, the artists now began\nto work for these worldly employers and painted pictures for\nkings, for grand-dukes and for rich bankers. Within a very\nshort time, the new method of painting with oil spread through\nEurope and in every country there developed a school of\nspecial painting which showed the characteristic tastes of the\npeople for whom these portraits and landscapes were made.",
        "In Spain, for example, Velasquez painted court-dwarfs\nand the weavers of the royal tapestry-factories, and all sorts\nof persons and subjects connected with the king and his court.\nBut in Holland, Rembrandt and Frans Hals and Vermeer\npainted the barnyard of the merchant’s house, and they painted\nhis rather dowdy wife and his healthy but bumptious children\nand the ships which had brought him his wealth. In Italy on\nthe other hand, where the Pope remained the largest patron\nof the arts, Michelangelo and Correggio continued to paint\nMadonnas and Saints, while in England, where the aristocracy\nwas very rich and powerful and in France where the\nkings had become uppermost in the state, the artists painted\ndistinguished gentlemen who were members of the government,\nand very lovely ladies who were friends of His Majesty.",
        "The great change in painting, which came about with the\nneglect of the old church and the rise of a new class in society,\nwas reflected in all other forms of art. The invention of printing\nhad made it possible for authors to win fame and reputation\nby writing books for the multitudes. In this way arose\nthe profession of the novelist and the illustrator. But the\npeople who had money enough to buy the new books were not\nthe sort who liked to sit at home of nights, looking at the ceiling\nor just sitting. They wanted to be amused. The few minstrels\nof the Middle Ages were not sufficient to cover the demand for\nentertainment. For the first time since the early Greek city-\nstates of two thousand years before, the professional playwright\nhad a chance to ply his trade. The Middle Ages had\nknown the theatre merely as part of certain church celebrations.\nThe tragedies of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\nhad told the story of the suffering of our Lord. But\nduring the sixteenth century the worldly theatre made its\nreappearance. It is true that, at first, the position of the\nprofessional playwright and actor was not a very high one.\nWilliam Shakespeare was regarded as a sort of circus-fellow\nwho amused his neighbours with his tragedies and comedies.\nBut when he died in the year 1616 he had begun to enjoy the\nrespect of his neighbours and actors were no longer subjects\nof police supervision.",
        "William’s contemporary, Lope de Vega, the incredible\nSpaniard who wrote no less than 1800 worldly and 400 religious\nplays, was a person of rank who received the papal approval\nupon his work. A century later, Moliere, the Frenchman,\nwas deemed worthy of the companionship of none less\nthan King Louis XIV.",
        "Since then, the theatre has enjoyed an ever increasing\naffection on the part of the people. To-day a “theatre” is part\nof every well-regulated city, and the “silent drama” of the\nmovies has penetrated to the tiniest of our prairie hamlets.",
        "Another art, however, was to become the most popular of\nall. That was music. Most of the old art-forms demanded a\ngreat deal of technical skill. It takes years and years of practice\nbefore our clumsy hand is able to follow the commands of\nthe brain and reproduce our vision upon canvas or in marble.\nIt takes a life-time to learn how to act or how to write a good\nnovel. And it takes a great deal of training on the part of the\npublic to appreciate the best in painting and writing and\nsculpture. But almost any one, not entirely tone-deaf, can\nfollow a tune and almost everybody can get enjoyment out of\nsome sort of music. The Middle Ages had heard a little music\nbut it had been entirely the music of the church. The holy\nchants were subject to very severe laws of rhythm and harmony\nand soon these became monotonous. Besides, they could not\nwell be sung in the street or in the market-place.",
        "The Renaissance changed this. Music once more came\ninto its own as the best friend of man, both in his happiness and\nin his sorrows.",
        "The Egyptians and the Babylonians and the ancient Jews\nhad all been great lovers of music. They had even combined\ndifferent instruments into regular orchestras. But the Greeks\nhad frowned upon this barbaric foreign noise. They liked to\nhear a man recite the stately poetry of Homer and Pindar.\nThey allowed him to accompany himself upon the lyre (the\npoorest of all stringed instruments). That was as far as any\none could go without incurring the risk of popular disapproval.\nThe Romans on the other hand had loved orchestral music at\ntheir dinners and parties and they had invented most of the\ninstruments which (in VERY modified form) we use to-day.\nThe early church had despised this music which smacked too\nmuch of the wicked pagan world which had just been destroyed.\nA few songs rendered by the entire congregation were\nall the bishops of the third and fourth centuries would tolerate.\nAs the congregation was apt to sing dreadfully out of key without\nthe guidance of an instrument, the church had afterwards allowed\nthe use of an organ, an invention of the second century of our era\nwhich consisted of a combination of the old pipes of Pan and\na pair of bellows.",
        "Then came the great migrations. The last of the Roman\nmusicians were either killed or became tramp-fiddlers going\nfrom city to city and playing in the street, and begging for\npennies like the harpist on a modern ferry-boat.",
        "But the revival of a more worldly civilisation in the cities\nof the late Middle Ages had created a new demand for musicians.\nInstruments like the horn, which had been used only\nas signal-instruments for hunting and fighting, were remodelled\nuntil they could reproduce sounds which were agreeable in the\ndance-hall and in the banqueting room. A bow strung with\nhorse-hair was used to play the old-fashioned guitar and before\nthe end of the Middle Ages this six-stringed instrument\n(the most ancient of all string-instruments which dates back\nto Egypt and Assyria) had grown into our modern four-\nstringed fiddle which Stradivarius and the other Italian violin-\nmakers of the eighteenth century brought to the height of perfection.",
        "And finally the modern piano was invented, the most wide-\nspread of all musical instruments, which has followed man into\nthe wilderness of the jungle and the ice-fields of Greenland.\nThe organ had been the first of all keyed instruments but the\nperformer always depended upon the co-operation of some one\nwho worked the bellows, a job which nowadays is done by electricity.\nThe musicians therefore looked for a handier and less\ncircumstantial instrument to assist them in training the pupils\nof the many church choirs. During the great eleventh century,\nGuido, a Benedictine monk of the town of Arezzo (the\nbirthplace of the poet Petrarch) gave us our modern system\nof musical annotation. Some time during that century, when\nthere was a great deal of popular interest in music, the first\ninstrument with both keys and strings was built. It must\nhave sounded as tinkly as one of those tiny children’s pianos\nwhich you can buy at every toy-shop. In the city of Vienna,\nthe town where the strolling musicians of the Middle Ages\n(who had been classed with jugglers and card sharps) had\nformed the first separate Guild of Musicians in the year 1288,\nthe little monochord was developed into something which we\ncan recognise as the direct ancestor of our modern Steinway.\nFrom Austria the “clavichord” as it was usually called in those\ndays (because it had “craves” or keys) went to Italy. There\nit was perfected into the “spinet” which was so called after\nthe inventor, Giovanni Spinetti of Venice. At last during\nthe eighteenth century, some time between 1709 and 1720,\nBartolomeo Cristofori made a “clavier” which allowed the\nperformer to play both loudly and softly or as it was said in\nItalian, “piano” and “forte.” This instrument with certain\nchanges became our “pianoforte” or piano.",
        "Then for the first time the world possessed an easy and convenient\ninstrument which could be mastered in a couple of years\nand did not need the eternal tuning of harps and fiddles and\nwas much pleasanter to the ears than the mediaeval tubas, clarinets,\ntrombones and oboes. Just as the phonograph has given\nmillions of modern people their first love of music so did the\nearly “pianoforte” carry the knowledge of music into much\nwider circles. Music became part of the education of every well-\nbred man and woman. Princes and rich merchants maintained\nprivate orchestras. The musician ceased to be a wandering\n“jongleur” and became a highly valued member of the community.\nMusic was added to the dramatic performances of\nthe theatre and out of this practice, grew our modern Opera.\nOriginally only a few very rich princes could afford the expenses\nof an “opera troupe.” But as the taste for this sort of\nentertainment grew, many cities built their own theatres where\nItalian and afterwards German operas were given to the unlimited\njoy of the whole community with the exception of a few\nsects of very strict Christians who still regarded music with\ndeep suspicion as something which was too lovely to be entirely\ngood for the soul.",
        "By the middle of the eighteenth century the musical life\nof Europe was in full swing. Then there came forward a\nman who was greater than all others, a simple organist of the\nThomas Church of Leipzig, by the name of Johann Sebastian\nBach. In his compositions for every known instrument, from\ncomic songs and popular dances to the most stately of sacred\nhymns and oratorios, he laid the foundation for all our modern\nmusic. When he died in the year 1750 he was succeeded by\nMozart, who created musical fabrics of sheer loveliness which\nremind us of lace that has been woven out of harmony and\nrhythm. Then came Ludwig van Beethoven, the most tragic\nof men, who gave us our modern orchestra, yet heard none of\nhis greatest compositions because he was deaf, as the result of a\ncold contracted during his years of poverty.",
        "Beethoven lived through the period of the great French\nRevolution. Full of hope for a new and glorious day, he had\ndedicated one of his symphonies to Napoleon. But he lived\nto regret the hour. When he died in the year 1827, Napoleon\nwas gone and the French Revolution was gone, but the steam\nengine had come and was filling the world with a sound that\nhad nothing in common with the dreams of the Third Symphony.",
        "Indeed, the new order of steam and iron and coal and large\nfactories had little use for art, for painting and sculpture and\npoetry and music. The old protectors of the arts, the Church\nand the princes and the merchants of the Middle Ages and the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries no longer existed. The\nleaders of the new industrial world were too busy and had too\nlittle education to bother about etchings and sonatas and bits\nof carved ivory, not to speak of the men who created those\nthings, and who were of no practical use to the community in\nwhich they lived. And the workmen in the factories listened\nto the drone of their engines until they too had lost all taste\nfor the melody of the flute or fiddle of their peasant ancestry.\nThe arts became the step-children of the new industrial era.\nArt and Life became entirely separated. Whatever paintings\nhad been left, were dying a slow death in the museums. And\nmusic became a monopoly of a few “virtuosi” who took the\nmusic away from the home and carried it to the concert-hall.",
        "But steadily, although slowly, the arts are coming back into\ntheir own. People begin to understand that Rembrandt and\nBeethoven and Rodin are the true prophets and leaders of\ntheir race and that a world without art and happiness resembles\na nursery without laughter.",
