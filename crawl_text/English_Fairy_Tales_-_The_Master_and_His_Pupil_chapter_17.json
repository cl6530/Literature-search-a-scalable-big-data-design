        "There was once a very learned man in the north-country who knew all\nthe languages under the sun, and who was acquainted with all the\nmysteries of creation. He had one big book bound in black calf and\nclasped with iron, and with iron corners, and chained to a table which\nwas made fast to the floor; and when he read out of this book, he\nunlocked it with an iron key, and none but he read from it, for it\ncontained all the secrets of the spiritual world. It told how many\nangels there were in heaven, and how they marched in their ranks, and\nsang in their quires, and what were their several functions, and what\nwas the name of each great angel of might. And it told of the demons,\nhow many of them there were, and what were their several powers, and\ntheir labours, and their names, and how they might be summoned, and\nhow tasks might be imposed on them, and how they might be chained to\nbe as slaves to man.",
        "Now the master had a pupil who was but a foolish lad, and he acted as\nservant to the great master, but never was he suffered to look into\nthe black book, hardly to enter the private room.",
        "One day the master was out, and then the lad, as curious as could be,\nhurried to the chamber where his master kept his wondrous apparatus\nfor changing copper into gold, and lead into silver, and where was his\nmirror in which he could see all that was passing in the world, and\nwhere was the shell which when held to the ear whispered all the words\nthat were being spoken by anyone the master desired to know about. The\nlad tried in vain with the crucibles to turn copper and lead into gold\nand silver–he looked long and vainly into the mirror; smoke and\nclouds passed over it, but he saw nothing plain, and the shell to his\near produced only indistinct murmurings, like the breaking of distant\nseas on an unknown shore. “I can do nothing,” he said; “as I don’t\nknow the right words to utter, and they are locked up in yon book.”",
        "He looked round, and, see! the book was unfastened; the master had\nforgotten to lock it before he went out. The boy rushed to it, and\nunclosed the volume. It was written with red and black ink, and much\nof it he could not understand; but he put his finger on a line and\nspelled it through.",
        "At once the room was darkened, and the house trembled; a clap of\nthunder rolled through the passage and the old room, and there stood\nbefore him a horrible, horrible form, breathing fire, and with eyes\nlike burning lamps. It was the demon Beelzebub, whom he had called up\nto serve him.",
        "“Set me a task!” said he, with a voice like the roaring of an iron\nfurnace.",
        "The boy only trembled, and his hair stood up.",
        "“Set me a task, or I shall strangle thee!”",
        "But the lad could not speak. Then the evil spirit stepped towards him,\nand putting forth his hands touched his throat. The fingers burned his\nflesh. “Set me a task!”",
        "“Water yon flower,” cried the boy in despair, pointing to a geranium\nwhich stood in a pot on the floor. Instantly the spirit left the room,\nbut in another instant he returned with a barrel on his back, and\npoured its contents over the flower; and again and again he went and\ncame, and poured more and more water, till the floor of the room was\nankle-deep.",
        "“Enough, enough!” gasped the lad; but the demon heeded him not; the\nlad didn’t know the words by which to send him away, and still he\nfetched water.",
        "It rose to the boy’s knees and still more water was poured. It mounted\nto his waist, and Beelzebub still kept on bringing barrels full. It\nrose to his armpits, and he scrambled to the table-top. And now the\nwater in the room stood up to the window and washed against the glass,\nand swirled around his feet on the table. It still rose; it reached\nhis breast. In vain he cried; the evil spirit would not be dismissed,\nand to this day he would have been pouring water, and would have\ndrowned all Yorkshire. But the master remembered on his journey that\nhe had not locked his book, and therefore returned, and at the moment\nwhen the water was bubbling about the pupil’s chin, rushed into the\nroom and spoke the words which cast Beelzebub back into his fiery\nhome.",
