        "“Woman wields a wonderful influence over man’s destinies,” said Woodtick\nWilliam, the other day, as he breathed gently on a chunk of blossom rock\nand then wiped it carefully with the tail of his coat.",
        "“Woman in most cases is gentle and long suffering, but if you observe\nclose for several consecutive weeks you will notice that she generally\ngets there with both feet.",
        "“I’ve been quite a student of the female mind myself. I have, therefore,\nhad a good deal of opportunity to compare the everedge man with the\neveredge woman as regards ketchin’ on in our great general farewell\njourney to the tomb.",
        "“Woman has figgered a good deal in my own destinies. My first wife was a\nlarge, powerful woman, who married me before I hardly knew it. She married\nme down near Provost, in an early day. Her name was Lorena. The name\ndidn’t seem to suit her complexion and phizzeek as a general thing. It was\nlike calling the fat woman in the museum Lily. Lorena was a woman of great\nstrength of purpose. She was also strong in the wrists. Lorena was of\nforeign extraction, with far-away eyes and large, earnest red hands. You\nought to have saw her preserve order during the hour for morning prayers.\nI had a hired man there in Utah, in them days, who was inclined to be a\nscoffer at our plain home-made style of religion. So I told Lorena that I\nwas a little afraid that Orlando Whoopenkaugh would rise up suddenly while\nI was at prayer and spatter my thinker all over the cook stove, or create\nsome other ruction that would cast a gloom over our devotions.",
        "“Lorena said: ’Never mind, William. You are more successful in prayer,\nwhile I am more successful in disturbances. You go on with your petition,\nand I will preserve order.”",
        "“Lorena saved my life once in a singular manner. Being a large, powerful\nwoman, of course she no doubt preserved me from harm a great many times;\nbut on this occasion it was a clear case.",
        "“I was then sinking on the Coopon claim, and had got the prospect shaft\ndown a couple of hundred foot and was drifting for the side wall with\nindifferent success. We was working a day shift of six men, blasting,\nhysting and a little timbering. I was in charge of the crew and eastern\ncapital was furnishing the ready John Davis, if you will allow me that low\nterm.",
        "“Lorena and me had been a little edgeways for several days, owing to a\nlittle sassy remark made by her and a retort on my part in which I\nthoughtlessly alluded to her brother, who was at that time serving out a\nlittle term for life down at Canyon City, and who, if his life is spared,\nis at it yet. If I wanted to make Lorena jump nine feet high and holler,\nall I had to do was just to allude in a jeering way to her family record,\nso she got madder and madder, till at last it ripened into open hostility,\nand about noon on the 13th day of September Lorena attacked me with a\nlarge butcher knife and drove me into the adjoining county. She told me,\nalso, that if I ever returned to Provost she would cut me in two right\nbetween the pancreas and the watch pocket and feed me to the hens.",
        "“I thought if she felt that way about it I would not return. I felt so\nhurt and so grieved about it that I never stopped till I got to Omaha.\nThen I heard how Lorena, as a means in the hands of Providence, had saved\nmy unprofitable life.",
        "“When she got back to the house and had put away her butcher knife, a man\ncame rushing in to tell her that the boys had struck a big pay streak of\nwater, and that the whole crew in the Coopon was drowned, her husband\namong the rest.",
        "“Then it dawned on Lorena how she had saved me, and for the first time in\nher life she burst into tears. People who saw her said her grief was\nterrible. Tears are sad enough when shed by a man, but when we see a\nstrong woman bowed in grief, we shudder.",
        "“No one who has never deserted his wife at her urgent request can fully\nrealize the pain and anguish it costs. I have been married many times\nsince, but the sensation is just the same to-day as it was the first time\nI ever deserted my wife.",
        "“As I said, though, a woman has a wonderful influence over a man’s whole\nlife. If I had a chance to change the great social fabric any, though, I\nshould ask woman to be more thoughtful of her husband, and, if possible,\nless severe. I would say to woman, be a man. Rise above these petty little\ntyrannical ways. Instead of asking your husband what he does with every\ncent you give him, learn to trust him. Teach him that you have confidence\nin him. Make him think you have anyway, whether you have or not. Do not\nseek to get a whiff of his breath every ten minutes to see whether he has\nbeen drinking or not. If you keep doing that you will sock him into a\ndrunkard’s grave, sure pop. He will at first lie about it, then he will\nuse disinfectants for the breath, and then he will stay away till he gets\nover it. The timid young man says, ’Pass the cloves, please. I’ve got to\nget ready to go home pretty soon.’ The man whose wife really has fun with\nhim says, ’Well, boys, good-night. I’m sorry for you.’ Then he goes home.",
        "“Very few men have had the opportunities for observation in a matrimonial\nway that I have, William. You see, one man judges all the wives in\nChristendom by his’n. Another does ditto, and so it goes. But I have made\nmatrimony a study. It has been a life-work for me. Others have simply\ndabbled into it. I have studied all its phases and I am an expert. So I\nsay to you that woman, in one way or another, either by strategy and\nwinnin’ ways or by main strength and awkwardness, is absolutely sure to\nwield an all-fired influence over poor, weak man, and while grass grows\nand water runs, pardner, you will always find her presiding over man’s\ndestinies and his ducats.”",
