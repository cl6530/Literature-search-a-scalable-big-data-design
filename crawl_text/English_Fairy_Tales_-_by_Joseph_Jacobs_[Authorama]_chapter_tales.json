        "Then, if you are very quiet, you will hear a teeny tiny voice say\nthrough the grating “Take down the Key.” This you will find at the\nback: you cannot mistake it, for it has J. J. in the wards. Put the\nKey in the Keyhole, which it fits exactly, unlock the door and walk in.",
        "To My Dear Little May",
        "Who says that English folk have no fairy-tales of their own? The\npresent volume contains only a selection out of some 140, of which I\nhave found traces in this country. It is probable that many more\nexist.",
        "A quarter of the tales in this volume, have been collected during the\nlast ten years or so, and some of them have not been hitherto\npublished. Up to 1870 it was equally said of France and of Italy, that\nthey possessed no folk-tales. Yet, within fifteen years from that\ndate, over 1000 tales had been collected in each country. I am hoping\nthat the present volume may lead to equal activity in this country,\nand would earnestly beg any reader of this book who knows of similar\ntales, to communicate them, written down as they are told, to me, care\nof Mr. Nutt. The only reason, I imagine, why such tales have not\nhitherto been brought to light, is the lamentable gap between the\ngoverning and recording classes and the dumb working classes of this\ncountry–dumb to others but eloquent among themselves. It would be no\nunpatriotic task to help to bridge over this gulf, by giving a common\nfund of nursery literature to all classes of the English people, and,\nin any case, it can do no harm to add to the innocent gaiety of the\nnation.",
        "A word or two as to our title seems necessary. We have called our\nstories Fairy Tales though few of them speak of fairies. [Footnote:\nFor some recent views on fairies and tales about fairies, see\nNotes.] The same remark applies to the collection of the Brothers\nGrimm and to all the other European collections, which contain exactly\nthe same classes of tales as ours. Yet our stories are what the little\nones mean when they clamour for “Fairy Tales,” and this is the only\nname which they give to them. One cannot imagine a child saying, “Tell\nus a folk-tale, nurse,” or “Another nursery tale, please, grandma.” As\nour book is intended for the little ones, we have indicated its\ncontents by the name they use. The words “Fairy Tales” must\naccordingly be taken to include tales in which occurs something\n\"fairy,” something extraordinary–fairies, giants, dwarfs, speaking\nanimals. It must be taken also to cover tales in which what is\nextraordinary is the stupidity of some of the actors. Many of the\ntales in this volume, as in similar collections for other European\ncountries, are what the folklorists call Drolls. They serve to justify\nthe title of Merrie England, which used to be given to this country of\nours, and indicate unsuspected capacity for fun and humour among the\nunlettered classes. The story of Tom Tit Tot, which opens our\ncollection, is unequalled among all other folk-tales I am acquainted\nwith, for its combined sense of humour and dramatic power.",
        "The first adjective of our title also needs a similar extension of its\nmeaning. I have acted on Molière’s principle, and have taken what was\ngood wherever I could find it. Thus, a couple of these stories have\nbeen found among descendants of English immigrants in America; a\ncouple of others I tell as I heard them myself in my youth in\nAustralia. One of the best was taken down from the mouth of an English\nGipsy. I have also included some stories that have only been found in\nLowland Scotch. I have felt justified in doing this, as of the twenty-\none folk-tales contained in Chambers’ “Popular Rhymes of Scotland,” no\nless than sixteen are also to be found in an English form. With the\nFolk-tale as with the Ballad, Lowland Scotch may be regarded as simply\na dialect of English, and it is a mere chance whether a tale is extant\nin one or other, or both.",
        "I have also rescued and re-told a few Fairy Tales that only exist now-\na-days in the form of ballads. There are certain indications that the\n\"common form” of the English Fairy Tale was the cante-fable, a\nmixture of narrative and verse of which the most illustrious example\nin literature is “Aucassin et Nicolette.” In one case I have\nendeavoured to retain this form, as the tale in which it occurs,\n\"Childe Rowland,” is mentioned by Shakespeare in King Lear, and\nis probably, as I have shown, the source of Milton’s Comus.\nLate as they have been collected, some dozen of the tales can be\ntraced back to the sixteenth century, two of them being quoted by\nShakespeare himself.",
        "In the majority of instances I have had largely to rewrite these Fairy\nTales, especially those in dialect, including the Lowland Scotch.\n[Footnote: It is perhaps worth remarking that the Brothers Grimm did\nthe same with their stories. “Dass der Ausdruck,” say they in their\nPreface, “und die Ausführung des Einzelnen grossentheils von uns\nherrührt, versteht sich von selbst.” I may add that many of their\nstories were taken from printed sources. In the first volume of Mrs.\nHunt’s translation, Nos. 12, 18, 19, 23, 32, 35, 42, 43, 44, 69, 77,\n78, 83, 89, are thus derived.] Children, and sometimes those of larger\ngrowth, will not read dialect. I have also had to reduce the flatulent\nphraseology of the eighteenth-century chap-books, and to re-write in\nsimpler style the stories only extant in “Literary” English. I have,\nhowever, left a few vulgarisms in the mouths of vulgar people.\nChildren appreciate the dramatic propriety of this as much as their\nelders. Generally speaking, it has been my ambition to write as a good\nold nurse will speak when she tells Fairy Tales. I am doubtful as to\nmy success in catching the colloquial-romantic tone appropriate for\nsuch narratives, but the thing had to be done or else my main object,\nto give a book of English Fairy Tales which English children will\nlisten to, would have been unachieved. This book is meant to be read\naloud, and not merely taken in by the eye.",
        "In a few instances I have introduced or changed an incident. I have\nnever done so, however, without mentioning the fact in the Notes.\nThese have been relegated to the obscurity of small print and a back\nplace, while the little ones have been, perhaps unnecessarily, warned\noff them. They indicate my sources and give a few references to\nparallels and variants which may be of interest to fellow-students of\nFolk-lore. It is, perhaps, not necessary to inform readers who are not\nfellow-students that the study of Folk-tales has pretensions to be a\nscience. It has its special terminology, and its own methods of\ninvestigation, by which it is hoped, one of these days, to gain fuller\nknowledge of the workings of the popular mind as well as traces of\narchaic modes of thought and custom. I hope on some future occasion to\ntreat the subject of the English Folk-tale on a larger scale and with\nall the necessary paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus. I shall\nthen, of course, reproduce my originals with literal accuracy, and\nhave therefore felt the more at liberty on the present occasion to\nmake the necessary deviations from this in order to make the tales\nreadable for children.",
        "Finally, I have to thank those by whose kindness in waiving their\nrights to some of these stories, I have been enabled to compile this\nbook. My friends Mr. E. Clodd, Mr. F. Hindes Groome, and Mr. Andrew\nLang, have thus yielded up to me some of the most attractive stories\nin the following pages. The Councils of the English and of the\nAmerican Folk-lore Societies, and Messrs. Longmans, have also been\nequally generous. Nor can I close these remarks without a word of\nthanks and praise to the artistic skill with which my friend, Mr. J.\nD. Batten, has made the romance and humour of these stories live again\nin the brilliant designs with which he has adorned these pages. It\nshould be added that the dainty headpieces to “Henny Penny” and “Mr.\nFox” are due to my old friend, Mr. Henry Ryland.",

        "Once upon a time there was a woman, and she baked five pies. And when\nthey came out of the oven, they were that overbaked the crusts were\ntoo hard to eat. So she says to her daughter:",
        "“Darter,” says she, “put you them there pies on the shelf, and leave\n’em there a little, and they’ll come again.\"–She meant, you know, the\ncrust would get soft.",
        "But the girl, she says to herself: “Well, if they’ll come again, I’ll\neat ’em now.” And she set to work and ate ’em all, first and last.",
        "Well, come supper-time the woman said: “Go you, and get one o’ them\nthere pies. I dare say they’ve come again now.”",
        "The girl went and she looked, and there was nothing but the dishes. So\nback she came and says she: “Noo, they ain’t come again.”",
        "“Not one of ’em?” says the mother.",
        "“Not one of ’em,” says she.",
        "“Well, come again, or not come again,” said the woman “I’ll have one\nfor supper.”",
        "“But you can’t, if they ain’t come,” said the girl.",
        "“But I can,” says she. “Go you, and bring the best of ’em.”",
        "“Best or worst,” says the girl, “I’ve ate ’em all, and you can’t have\none till that’s come again.”",
        "Well, the woman she was done, and she took her spinning to the door to\nspin, and as she span she sang:",
        "  “My darter ha’ ate five, five pies to-day.\n  My darter ha’ ate five, five pies to-day.”",
        "The king was coming down the street, and he heard her sing, but what\nshe sang he couldn’t hear, so he stopped and said:",
        "“What was that you were singing, my good woman?”",
        "The woman was ashamed to let him hear what her daughter had been\ndoing, so she sang, instead of that:",
        "  “My darter ha’ spun five, five skeins to-day.\n  My darter ha’ spun five, five skeins to-day.”",
        "“Stars o’ mine!” said the king, “I never heard tell of any one that\ncould do that.”",
        "Then he said: “Look you here, I want a wife, and I’ll marry your\ndaughter. But look you here,” says he, “eleven months out of the year\nshe shall have all she likes to eat, and all the gowns she likes to\nget, and all the company she likes to keep; but the last month of the\nyear she’ll have to spin five skeins every day, and if she don’t I\nshall kill her.”",
        "“All right,” says the woman; for she thought what a grand marriage\nthat was. And as for the five skeins, when the time came, there’d be\nplenty of ways of getting out of it, and likeliest, he’d have\nforgotten all about it.",
        "Well, so they were married. And for eleven months the girl had all she\nliked to eat, and all the gowns she liked to get, and all the company\nshe liked to keep.",
        "But when the time was getting over, she began to think about the\nskeins and to wonder if he had ’em in mind. But not one word did he\nsay about ’em, and she thought he’d wholly forgotten ’em.",
        "However, the last day of the last month he takes her to a room she’d\nnever set eyes on before. There was nothing in it but a spinning-wheel\nand a stool. And says he: “Now, my dear, here you’ll be shut in to-\nmorrow with some victuals and some flax, and if you haven’t spun five\nskeins by the night, your head’ll go off.”",
        "And away he went about his business.",
        "Well, she was that frightened, she’d always been such a gatless girl,\nthat she didn’t so much as know how to spin, and what was she to do\nto-morrow with no one to come nigh her to help her? She sat down on a\nstool in the kitchen, and law! how she did cry!",
        "However, all of a sudden she heard a sort of a knocking low down on\nthe door. She upped and oped it, and what should she see but a small\nlittle black thing with a long tail. That looked up at her right\ncurious, and that said:",
        "“What are you a-crying for?”",
        "“What’s that to you?” says she.",
        "“Never you mind,” that said, “but tell me what you’re a-crying for.”",
        "“That won’t do me no good if I do,” says she.",
        "“You don’t know that,” that said, and twirled that’s tail round.",
        "“Well,” says she, “that won’t do no harm, if that don’t do no good,\"\nand she upped and told about the pies, and the skeins, and everything.",
        "“This is what I’ll do,” says the little black thing, “I’ll come to\nyour window every morning and take the flax and bring it spun at\nnight.”",
        "“What’s your pay?” says she.",
        "That looked out of the corner of that’s eyes, and that said: “I’ll\ngive you three guesses every night to guess my name, and if you\nhaven’t guessed it before the month’s up you shall be mine.”",
        "Well, she thought she’d be sure to guess that’s name before the month\nwas up. “All right,” says she, “I agree.”",
        "“All right,” that says, and law! how that twirled that’s tail.",
        "Well, the next day, her husband took her into the room, and there was\nthe flax and the day’s food.",
        "“Now there’s the flax,” says he, “and if that ain’t spun up this\nnight, off goes your head.” And then he went out and locked the door.",
        "He’d hardly gone, when there was a knocking against the window.",
        "She upped and she oped it, and there sure enough was the little old\nthing sitting on the ledge.",
        "“Where’s the flax?” says he.",
        "“Here it be,” says she. And she gave it to him.",
        "Well, come the evening a knocking came again to the window. She upped\nand she oped it, and there was the little old thing with five skeins\nof flax on his arm.",
        "“Here it be,” says he, and he gave it to her.",
        "“Now, what’s my name?” says he.",
        "“What, is that Bill?” says she.",
        "“Noo, that ain’t,” says he, and he twirled his tail.",
        "“Is that Ned?” says she.",
        "“Noo, that ain’t,” says he, and he twirled his tail.",
        "“Well, is that Mark?” says she.",
        "“Noo, that ain’t,” says he, and he twirled his tail harder, and away\nhe flew.",
        "Well, when her husband came in, there were the five skeins ready for\nhim. “I see I shan’t have to kill you to-night, my dear,” says he;\n\"you’ll have your food and your flax in the morning,” says he, and\naway he goes.",
        "Well, every day the flax and the food were brought, and every day that\nthere little black impet used to come mornings and evenings. And all\nthe day the girl sat trying to think of names to say to it when it\ncame at night. But she never hit on the right one. And as it got\ntowards the end of the month, the impet began to look so maliceful,\nand that twirled that’s tail faster and faster each time she gave a\nguess.",
        "At last it came to the last day but one. The impet came at night along\nwith the five skeins, and that said,",
        "“What, ain’t you got my name yet?”",
        "“Is that Nicodemus?” says she.",
        "“Noo, t’ain’t,” that says.",
        "“Is that Sammle?” says she.",
        "“Noo, t’ain’t,” that says.",
        "“A-well, is that Methusalem?” says she.",
        "“Noo, t’ain’t that neither,” that says.",
        "Then that looks at her with that’s eyes like a coal o’ fire, and that\nsays: “Woman, there’s only to-morrow night, and then you’ll be mine!\"\nAnd away it flew.",
        "Well, she felt that horrid. However, she heard the king coming along\nthe passage. In he came, and when he sees the five skeins, he says,\nsays he,",
        "“Well, my dear,” says he, “I don’t see but what you’ll have your\nskeins ready to-morrow night as well, and as I reckon I shan’t have to\nkill you, I’ll have supper in here to-night.” So they brought supper,\nand another stool for him, and down the two sat.",
        "Well, he hadn’t eaten but a mouthful or so, when he stops and begins\nto laugh.",
        "“What is it?” says she.",
        "“A-why,” says he, “I was out a-hunting to-day, and I got away to a\nplace in the wood I’d never seen before And there was an old chalk-\npit. And I heard a kind of a sort of a humming. So I got off my hobby,\nand I went right quiet to the pit, and I looked down. Well, what\nshould there be but the funniest little black thing you ever set eyes\non. And what was that doing, but that had a little spinning-wheel, and\nthat was spinning wonderful fast, and twirling that’s tail. And as\nthat span that sang:",
        "  “Nimmy nimmy not\n  My name’s Tom Tit Tot.”",
        "Well, when the girl heard this, she felt as if she could have jumped\nout of her skin for joy, but she didn’t say a word.",
        "Next day that there little thing looked so maliceful when he came for\nthe flax. And when night came, she heard that knocking against the\nwindow panes. She oped the window, and that come right in on the\nledge. That was grinning from ear to ear, and Oo! that’s tail was\ntwirling round so fast.",
        "“What’s my name?” that says, as that gave her the skeins.",
        "“Is that Solomon?” she says, pretending to be afeard.",
        "“Noo, t’ain’t,” that says, and that came further into the room.",
        "“Well, is that Zebedee?” says she again.",
        "“Noo, t’ain’t,” says the impet. And then that laughed and twirled\nthat’s tail till you couldn’t hardly see it.",
        "“Take time, woman,” that says; “next guess, and you’re mine.” And that\nstretched out that’s black hands at her.",
        "Well, she backed a step or two, and she looked at it, and then she\nlaughed out, and says she, pointing her finger at it:",
        "“Nimmy Nimmy Not, Your Name’s Tom Tit Tot!”",
        "Well, when that heard her, that gave an awful shriek and away that\nflew into the dark, and she never saw it any more.",
        "Once upon a time there was a farmer and his wife who had one daughter,\nand she was courted by a gentleman. Every evening he used to come and\nsee her, and stop to supper at the farmhouse, and the daughter used to\nbe sent down into the cellar to draw the beer for supper. So one\nevening she had gone down to draw the beer, and she happened to look\nup at the ceiling while she was drawing, and she saw a mallet stuck in\none of the beams. It must have been there a long, long time, but\nsomehow or other she had never noticed it before, and she began a-\nthinking. And she thought it was very dangerous to have that mallet\nthere, for she said to herself: “Suppose him and me was to be married,\nand we was to have a son, and he was to grow up to be a man, and come\ndown into the cellar to draw the beer, like as I’m doing now, and the\nmallet was to fall on his head and kill him, what a dreadful thing it\nwould be!” And she put down the candle and the jug, and sat herself\ndown and began a-crying.",
        "Well, they began to wonder upstairs how it was that she was so long\ndrawing the beer, and her mother went down to see after her, and she\nfound her sitting on the settle crying, and the beer running over the\nfloor. “Why, whatever is the matter?” said her mother. “Oh, mother!\"\nsays she, “look at that horrid mallet! Suppose we was to be married,\nand was to have a son, and he was to grow up, and was to come down to\nthe cellar to draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his head\nand kill him, what a dreadful thing it would be!” “Dear, dear! what a\ndreadful thing it would be!” said the mother, and she sat her down\naside of the daughter and started a-crying too. Then after a bit the\nfather began to wonder that they didn’t come back, and he went down\ninto the cellar to look after them himself, and there they two sat a-\ncrying, and the beer running all over the floor. “Whatever is the\nmatter?” says he. “Why,” says the mother, “look at that horrid mallet.\nJust suppose, if our daughter and her sweetheart was to be married,\nand was to have a son, and he was to grow up, and was to come down\ninto the cellar to draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his\nhead and kill him, what a dreadful thing it would be!” “Dear, dear,\ndear! so it would!” said the father, and he sat himself down aside of\nthe other two, and started a-crying.",
        "Now the gentleman got tired of stopping up in the kitchen by himself,\nand at last he went down into the cellar too, to see what they were\nafter; and there they three sat a-crying side by side, and the beer\nrunning all over the floor. And he ran straight and turned the tap.\nThen he said: “Whatever are you three doing, sitting there crying, and\nletting the beer run all over the floor?”",
        "“Oh!” says the father, “look at that horrid mallet! Suppose you and\nour daughter was to be married, and was to have a son, and he was to\ngrow up, and was to come down into the cellar to draw the beer, and\nthe mallet was to fall on his head and kill him!” And then they all\nstarted a-crying worse than before. But the gentleman burst out a-\nlaughing, and reached up and pulled out the mallet, and then he said:\n\"I’ve travelled many miles, and I never met three such big sillies as\nyou three before; and now I shall start out on my travels again, and\nwhen I can find three bigger sillies than you three, then I’ll come\nback and marry your daughter.” So he wished them good-bye, and started\noff on his travels, and left them all crying because the girl had lost\nher sweetheart.",
        "Well, he set out, and he travelled a long way, and at last he came to\na woman’s cottage that had some grass growing on the roof. And the\nwoman was trying to get her cow to go up a ladder to the grass, and\nthe poor thing durst not go. So the gentleman asked the woman what she\nwas doing. “Why, lookye,” she said, “look at all that beautiful grass.\nI’m going to get the cow on to the roof to eat it. She’ll be quite\nsafe, for I shall tie a string round her neck, and pass it down the\nchimney, and tie it to my wrist as I go about the house, so she can’t\nfall off without my knowing it.” “Oh, you poor silly!” said the\ngentleman, “you should cut the grass and throw it down to the cow!\"\nBut the woman thought it was easier to get the cow up the ladder than\nto get the grass down, so she pushed her and coaxed her and got her\nup, and tied a string round her neck, and passed it down the chimney,\nand fastened it to her own wrist. And the gentleman went on his way,\nbut he hadn’t gone far when the cow tumbled off the roof, and hung by\nthe string tied round her neck, and it strangled her. And the weight\nof the cow tied to her wrist pulled the woman up the chimney, and she\nstuck fast half-way and was smothered in the soot.",
        "Well, that was one big silly.",
        "And the gentleman went on and on, and he went to an inn to stop the\nnight, and they were so full at the inn that they had to put him in a\ndouble-bedded room, and another traveller was to sleep in the other\nbed. The other man was a very pleasant fellow, and they got very\nfriendly together; but in the morning, when they were both getting up,\nthe gentleman was surprised to see the other hang his trousers on the\nknobs of the chest of drawers and run across the room and try to jump\ninto them, and he tried over and over again, and couldn’t manage it;\nand the gentleman wondered whatever he was doing it for. At last he\nstopped and wiped his face with his handkerchief. “Oh dear,” he says,\n\"I do think trousers are the most awkwardest kind of clothes that ever\nwere. I can’t think who could have invented such things. It takes me\nthe best part of an hour to get into mine every morning, and I get so\nhot! How do you manage yours?” So the gentleman burst out a-laughing,\nand showed him how to put them on; and he was very much obliged to\nhim, and said he never should have thought of doing it that way.",
        "So that was another big silly.",
        "Then the gentleman went on his travels again; and he came to a\nvillage, and outside the village there was a pond, and round the pond\nwas a crowd of people. And they had got rakes, and brooms, and\npitchforks, reaching into the pond; and the gentleman asked what was\nthe matter. “Why,” they say, “matter enough! Moon’s tumbled into the\npond, and we can’t rake her out anyhow!” So the gentleman burst out a-\nlaughing, and told them to look up into the sky, and that it was only\nthe shadow in the water. But they wouldn’t listen to him, and abused\nhim shamefully, and he got away as quick as he could.",
        "So there was a whole lot of sillies bigger than them three sillies at\nhome. So the gentleman turned back home again and married the farmer’s\ndaughter, and if they didn’t live happy for ever after, that’s nothing\nto do with you or me.",
        "There was once upon a time a good man who had two children: a girl by\na first wife, and a boy by the second. The girl was as white as milk,\nand her lips were like cherries. Her hair was like golden silk, and it\nhung to the ground. Her brother loved her dearly, but her wicked\nstepmother hated her. “Child,” said the stepmother one day, “go to the\ngrocer’s shop and buy me a pound of candles.” She gave her the money;\nand the little girl went, bought the candles, and started on her\nreturn. There was a stile to cross. She put down the candles whilst\nshe got over the stile. Up came a dog and ran off with the candles.",
        "She went back to the grocer’s, and she got a second bunch. She came to\nthe stile, set down the candles, and proceeded to climb over. Up came\nthe dog and ran off with the candles.",
        "She went again to the grocer’s, and she got a third bunch; and just\nthe same happened. Then she came to her stepmother crying, for she had\nspent all the money and had lost three bunches of candles.",
        "The stepmother was angry, but she pretended not to mind the loss. She\nsaid to the child: “Come, lay your head on my lap that I may comb your\nhair.” So the little one laid her head in the woman’s lap, who\nproceeded to comb the yellow silken hair. And when she combed the hair\nfell over her knees, and rolled right down to the ground.",
        "Then the stepmother hated her more for the beauty of her hair; so she\nsaid to her, “I cannot part your hair on my knee, fetch a billet of\nwood.” So she fetched it. Then said the stepmother, “I cannot part\nyour hair with a comb, fetch me an axe.” So she fetched it.",
        "“Now,” said the wicked woman, “lay your head down on the billet whilst\nI part your hair.”",
        "Well! she laid down her little golden head without fear; and whist!\ndown came the axe, and it was off. So the mother wiped the axe and\nlaughed.",
        "Then she took the heart and liver of the little girl, and she stewed\nthem and brought them into the house for supper. The husband tasted\nthem and shook his head. He said they tasted very strangely. She gave\nsome to the little boy, but he would not eat. She tried to force him,\nbut he refused, and ran out into the garden, and took up his little\nsister, and put her in a box, and buried the box under a rose-tree;\nand every day he went to the tree and wept, till his tears ran down on\nthe box.",
        "One day the rose-tree flowered. It was spring, and there among the\nflowers was a white bird; and it sang, and sang, and sang like an\nangel out of heaven. Away it flew, and it went to a cobbler’s shop,\nand perched itself on a tree hard by; and thus it sang,",

        "“Sing again that beautiful song,” asked the shoemaker. “If you will\nfirst give me those little red shoes you are making.” The cobbler gave\nthe shoes, and the bird sang the song; then flew to a tree in front of\na watchmaker’s, and sang:",

        "“Oh, the beautiful song! sing it again, sweet bird,” asked the\nwatchmaker. “If you will give me first that gold watch and chain in\nyour hand.” The jeweller gave the watch and chain. The bird took it in\none foot, the shoes in the other, and, after having repeated the song,\nflew away to where three millers were picking a millstone. The bird\nperched on a tree and sang:",
        "  “My wicked mother slew me,\n  My dear father ate me,\n  My little brother whom I love\n  Sits below, and I sing above\n    Stick!”",
        "Then one of the men put down his tool and looked up from his work,",

        "Then all three cried out with one voice: “Oh, what a beautiful song!\nSing it, sweet bird, again.” “If you will put the millstone round my\nneck,” said the bird. The men did what the bird wanted and away to the\ntree it flew with the millstone round its neck, the red shoes in one\nfoot, and the gold watch and chain in the other. It sang the song and\nthen flew home. It rattled the millstone against the eaves of the\nhouse, and the stepmother said: “It thunders.” Then the little boy ran\nout to see the thunder, and down dropped the red shoes at his feet. It\nrattled the millstone against the eaves of the house once more, and\nthe stepmother said again: “It thunders.” Then the father ran out and\ndown fell the chain about his neck.",
        "In ran father and son, laughing and saying, “See, what fine things the\nthunder has brought us!” Then the bird rattled the millstone against\nthe eaves of the house a third time; and the stepmother said: “It\nthunders again, perhaps the thunder has brought something for me,” and\nshe ran out; but the moment she stepped outside the door, down fell\nthe millstone on her head; and so she died.",

        "Mr. and Mrs. Vinegar lived in a vinegar bottle. Now, one day, when Mr.\nVinegar was from home, Mrs. Vinegar, who was a very good housewife,\nwas busily sweeping her house, when an unlucky thump of the broom\nbrought the whole house clitter-clatter, clitter-clatter, about her\nears. In an agony of grief she rushed forth to meet her husband.",
        "On seeing him she exclaimed, “Oh, Mr. Vinegar, Mr. Vinegar, we are\nruined, I have knocked the house down, and it is all to pieces!” Mr.\nVinegar then said: “My dear, let us see what can be done. Here is the\ndoor; I will take it on my back, and we will go forth to seek our\nfortune.”",
        "They walked all that day, and at nightfall entered a thick forest.\nThey were both very, very tired, and Mr. Vinegar said: “My love, I\nwill climb up into a tree, drag up the door, and you shall follow.” He\naccordingly did so, and they both stretched their weary limbs on the\ndoor, and fell fast asleep.",
        "In the middle of the night Mr. Vinegar was disturbed by the sound of\nvoices underneath, and to his horror and dismay found that it was a\nband of thieves met to divide their booty.",
        "“Here, Jack,” said one, “here’s five pounds for you; here, Bill,\nhere’s ten pounds for you; here, Bob, here’s three pounds for you.”",
        "Mr. Vinegar could listen no longer; his terror was so great that he\ntrembled and trembled, and shook down the door on their heads. Away\nscampered the thieves, but Mr. Vinegar dared not quit his retreat till\nbroad daylight.",
        "He then scrambled out of the tree, and went to lift up the door. What\ndid he see but a number of golden guineas. “Come down, Mrs. Vinegar,\"\nhe cried; “come down, I say; our fortune’s made, our fortune’s made!\nCome down, I say.”",
        "Mrs. Vinegar got down as fast as she could, and when she saw the money\nshe jumped for joy. “Now, my dear,” said she, “I’ll tell you what you\nshall do. There is a fair at the neighbouring town; you shall take\nthese forty guineas and buy a cow. I can make butter and cheese, which\nyou shall sell at market, and we shall then be able to live very\ncomfortably.”",
        "Mr. Vinegar joyfully agrees, takes the money, and off he goes to the\nfair. When he arrived, he walked up and down, and at length saw a\nbeautiful red cow. It was an excellent milker, and perfect in every\nway. “Oh,” thought Mr. Vinegar, “if I had but that cow, I should be\nthe happiest, man alive.”",
        "So he offers the forty guineas for the cow, and the owner said that,\nas he was a friend, he’d oblige him. So the bargain was made, and he\ngot the cow and he drove it backwards and forwards to show it.",
        "By-and-by he saw a man playing the bagpipes–Tweedle-dum tweedle-dee.\nThe children followed him about, and he appeared to be pocketing money\non all sides. “Well,” thought Mr. Vinegar, “if I had but that\nbeautiful instrument I should be the happiest man alive–my fortune\nwould be made.”",
        "So he went up to the man. “Friend,” says he, “what a beautiful\ninstrument that is, and what a deal of money you must make.” “Why,\nyes,” said the man, “I make a great deal of money, to be sure, and it\nis a wonderful instrument.” “Oh!” cried Mr. Vinegar, “how I should\nlike to possess it!” “Well,” said the man, “as you are a friend, I\ndon’t much mind parting with it; you shall have it for that red cow.\"\n\"Done!” said the delighted Mr. Vinegar. So the beautiful red cow was\ngiven for the bagpipes.",
        "He walked up and down with his purchase; but it was in vain he tried\nto play a tune, and instead of pocketing pence, the boys followed him\nhooting, laughing, and pelting.",
        "Poor Mr. Vinegar, his fingers grew very cold, and, just as he was\nleaving the town, he met a man with a fine thick pair of gloves. “Oh,\nmy fingers are so very cold,” said Mr. Vinegar to himself. “Now if I\nhad but those beautiful gloves I should be the happiest man alive.” He\nwent up to the man, and said to him, “Friend, you seem to have a\ncapital pair of gloves there.” “Yes, truly,” cried the man; “and my\nhands are as warm as possible this cold November day.” “Well,” said\nMr. Vinegar, “I should like to have them.”. “What will you give?” said\nthe man; “as you are a friend, I don’t much mind letting you have them\nfor those bagpipes.” “Done!” cried Mr. Vinegar. He put on the gloves,\nand felt perfectly happy as he trudged homewards.",
        "At last he grew very tired, when he saw a man coming towards him with\na good stout stick in his hand.",
        "“Oh,” said Mr. Vinegar, “that I had but that stick! I should then be\nthe happiest man alive.” He said to the man: “Friend! what a rare good\nstick you have got.” “Yes,” said the man; “I have used it for many a\nlong mile, and a good friend it has been; but if you have a fancy for\nit, as you are a friend, I don’t mind giving it to you for that pair\nof gloves.” Mr. Vinegar’s hands were so warm, and his legs so tired,\nthat he gladly made the exchange.",
        "As he drew near to the wood where he had left his wife, he heard a\nparrot on a tree calling out his name: “Mr. Vinegar, you foolish man,\nyou blockhead, you simpleton; you went to the fair, and laid out all\nyour money in buying a cow. Not content with that, you changed it for\nbagpipes, on which you could not play, and which were not worth one-\ntenth of the money. You fool, you–you had no sooner got the bagpipes\nthan you changed them for the gloves, which were not worth one-quarter\nof the money; and when you had got the gloves, you changed them for a\npoor miserable stick; and now for your forty guineas, cow, bagpipes,\nand gloves, you have nothing to show but that poor miserable stick,\nwhich you might have cut in any hedge.” On this the bird laughed and\nlaughed, and Mr. Vinegar, falling into a violent rage, threw the stick\nat its head. The stick lodged in the tree, and he returned to his wife\nwithout money, cow, bagpipes, gloves, or stick, and she instantly gave\nhim such a sound cudgelling that she almost broke every bone in his\nskin.",
        "There once lived a king and a queen as many a one has been. They were\nlong married and had no children; but at last a baby-boy came to the\nqueen when the king was away in the far countries. The queen would not\nchristen the boy till the king came back, and she said, “We will just\ncall him Nix Nought Nothing until his father comes home.” But\nit was long before he came home, and the boy had grown a nice little\nladdie. At length the king was on his way back; but he had a big river\nto cross, and there was a whirlpool, and he could not get over the\nwater. But a giant came up to him, and said “I’ll carry you over.” But\nthe king said: “What’s your pay?” “O give me Nix, Nought, Nothing, and\nI will carry you over the water on my back.” The king had never heard\nthat his son was called Nix Nought Nothing, and so he said: “O, I’ll\ngive you that and my thanks into the bargain.” When the king got home\nagain, he was very happy to see his wife again, and his young son. She\ntold him that she had not given the child any name, but just Nix\nNought Nothing, until he should come home again himself. The poor king\nwas in a terrible case. He said: “What have I done? I promised to give\nthe giant who carried me over the river on his back, Nix Nought\nNothing.” The king and the queen were sad and sorry, but they said:\n\"When the giant comes we will give him the hen-wife’s boy; he will\nnever know the difference.” The next day the giant came to claim the\nking’s promise, and he sent for the hen-wife’s boy; and the giant went\naway with the boy on his back. He travelled till he came to a big\nstone, and there he sat down to rest. He said,",
        "“Hidge, Hodge, on my back, what time of day is that?”",
        "The poor little boy said: “It is the time that my mother, the hen-\nwife, takes up the eggs for the queen’s breakfast.”",
        "The Giant was very angry, and dashed the boy’s head on the stone and\nkilled him.",
        "So he went back in a tower of a temper and this time they gave him the\ngardener’s boy. He went off with him on his back till they got to the\nstone again when the giant sat down to rest. And he said:",
        "“Hidge, Hodge, on my back, what time of day do you make that?”",
        "The gardener’s boy said: “Sure it’s the time that my mother takes up\nthe vegetables for the queen’s dinner.” Then the giant was right wild\nand dashed his brains out on the stone.",
        "Then the giant went back to the king’s house in a terrible temper and\nsaid he would destroy them all if they did not give him Nix Nought\nNothing this time. They had to do it; and when he came to the big\nstone, the giant said: “What time of day is that?” Nix Nought Nothing\nsaid: “It is the time that my father the king will be sitting down to\nsupper.” The giant said: “I’ve got the right one now;” and took Nix\nNought Nothing to his own house and brought him up till he was a man.",
        "The giant had a bonny daughter, and she and the lad grew very fond of\neach other. The giant said one day to Nix Nought Nothing: “I’ve work\nfor you to-morrow. There is a stable seven miles long and seven miles\nbroad, and it has not been cleaned for seven years, and you must clean\nit to-morrow, or I will have you for my supper.”",
        "The giant’s daughter went out next morning with the lad’s breakfast,\nand found him in a terrible state, for always as he cleaned out a bit,\nit just fell in again. The giant’s daughter said she would help him,\nand she cried all the beasts in the field, and all the fowls of the\nair, and in a minute they all came, and carried away everything that\nwas in the stable and made it all clean before the giant came home. He\nsaid: “Shame on the wit that helped you; but I have a worse job for\nyou to-morrow.” Then he said to Nix Nought Nothing: “There’s a lake\nseven miles long, and seven miles deep, and seven miles broad, and you\nmust drain it to-morrow by nightfall, or else I’ll have you for my\nsupper.” Nix Nought Nothing began early next morning and tried to lave\nthe water with his pail, but the lake was never getting any less, and\nhe didn’t know what to do; but the giant’s daughter called on all the\nfish in the sea to come and drink the water, and very soon they drank\nit dry. When the giant saw the work done he was in a rage, and said:\n\"I’ve a worse job for you to-morrow; there is a tree, seven miles\nhigh, and no branch on it, till you get to the top, and there is a\nnest with seven eggs in it, and you must bring down all the eggs\nwithout breaking one, or else I’ll have you for my supper.” At first\nthe giant’s daughter did not know how to help Nix Nought Nothing; but\nshe cut off first her fingers and then her toes, and made steps of\nthem, and he clomb the tree and got all the eggs safe till he came\njust to the bottom, and then one was broken. So they determined to run\naway together and after the giant’s daughter had tidied up her hair a\nbit and got her magic flask they set out together as fast as they\ncould run. And they hadn’t got but three fields away when they looked\nback and saw the giant walking along at top speed after them. “Quick,\nquick,” called out the giant’s daughter, “take my comb from my hair\nand throw it down.” Nix Nought Nothing took her comb from her hair and\nthrew it down, and out of every one of its prongs there sprung up a\nfine thick briar in the way of the giant. You may be sure it took him\na long time to work his way through the briar bush and by the time he\nwas well through Nix Nought Nothing and his sweetheart had run on a\ntidy step away from him. But he soon came along after them and was\njust like to catch ’em up when the giant’s daughter called out to Nix\nNought Nothing, “Take my hair dagger and throw it down, quick, quick.\"\nSo Nix Nought Nothing threw down the hair dagger and out of it grew as\nquick as lightning a thick hedge of sharp razors placed criss-cross.\nThe giant had to tread very cautiously to get through all this and\nmeanwhile the young lovers ran on, and on, and on, till they were\nnearly out of sight. But at last the giant was through, and it wasn’t\nlong before he was like to catch them up. But just as he was\nstretching out his hand to catch Nix Nought Nothing his daughter took\nout her magic flask and dashed it on the ground. And as it broke out\nof it welled a big, big wave that grew, and that grew, till it reached\nthe giant’s waist and then his neck, and when it got to his head, he\nwas drowned dead, and dead, and dead indeed. So he goes out of the\nstory.",
        "But Nix Nought Nothing fled on till where do you think they came to?\nWhy, to near the castle of Nix Nought Nothing’s father and mother. But\nthe giant’s daughter was so weary that she couldn’t move a step\nfurther. So Nix Nought Nothing told her to wait there while he went\nand found out a lodging for the night. And he went on towards the\nlights of the castle, and on the way he came to the cottage of the\nhen-wife whose boy had had his brains dashed out by the giant. Now she\nknew Nix Nought Nothing in a moment, and hated him because he was the\ncause of her son’s death. So when he asked his way to the castle she\nput a spell upon him, and when he got to the castle, no sooner was he\nlet in than he fell down dead asleep upon a bench in the hall. The\nking and queen tried all they could do to wake him up, but all in\nvain. So the king promised that if any lady could wake him up she\nshould marry him. Meanwhile the giant’s daughter was waiting and\nwaiting for him to come back. And she went up into a tree to watch for\nhim. The gardener’s daughter, going to draw water in the well, saw the\nshadow of the lady in the water and thought it was herself, and said;\n\"If I’m so bonny, if I’m so brave, why do you send me to draw water?\"\nSo she threw down her pail and went to see if she could wed the\nsleeping stranger. And she went to the hen-wife, who taught her an\nunspelling catch which would keep Nix Nought Nothing awake as long as\nthe gardener’s daughter liked. So she went up to the castle and sang\nher catch and Nix Nought Nothing was wakened for a bit and they\npromised to wed him to the gardener’s daughter. Meanwhile the gardener\nwent down to draw water from the well and saw the shadow of the lady\nin the water. So he looks up and finds her, and he brought the lady\nfrom the tree, and led her into his house. And he told her that a\nstranger was to marry his daughter, and took her up to the castle and\nshowed her the man: and it was Nix Nought Nothing asleep in a chair.\nAnd she saw him, and cried to him: “Waken, waken, and speak to me!\"\nBut he would not waken, and soon she cried:",
        "  “I cleaned the stable, I laved the lake, and I clomb the tree,\n  And all for the love of thee,\n  And thou wilt not waken and speak to me.”",
        "The king and the queen heard this, and came to the bonny young lady,\nand she said:",
        "“I cannot get Nix Nought Nothing to speak to me for all that I can\ndo.”",
        "Then were they greatly astonished when she spoke of Nix Nought\nNothing, and asked where he was, and she said: “He that sits there in\nthe chair.” Then they ran to him and kissed him and called him their\nown dear son; so they called for the gardener’s daughter and made her\nsing her charm, and he wakened, and told them all that the giant’s\ndaughter had done for him, and of all her kindness. Then they took her\nin their arms and kissed her, and said she should now be their\ndaughter, for their son should marry her. But they sent for the hen-\nwife and put her to death. And they lived happy all their days.",
        "There was an old soldier who had been long in the wars–so long, that\nhe was quite out-at-elbows, and he did not know where to go to find a\nliving. So he walked up moors, down glens, till at last he came to a\nfarm, from which the good man had gone away to market. The wife of the\nfarmer was a very foolish woman, who had been a widow when he married\nher; the farmer was foolish enough, too, and it is hard to say which\nof the two was the more foolish. When you’ve heard my tale you may\ndecide.",
        "Now before the farmer goes to market says he to his wife: “Here is ten\npounds all in gold, take care of it till I come home.” If the man had\nnot been a fool he would never have given the money to his wife to\nkeep. Well, off he went in his cart to market, and the wife said to\nherself: “I will keep the ten pounds quite safe from thieves;” so she\ntied it up in a rag, and she put the rag up the parlour chimney.",
        "“There,” said she, “no thieves will ever find it now, that is quite\nsure.”",
        "Jack Hannaford, the old soldier, came and rapped at the door.",
        "“Who is there?” asked the wife.",
        "“Jack Hannaford.”",
        "“Where do you come from?”",
        "“Paradise.”",
        "“Lord a’ mercy! and maybe you’ve seen my old man there,” alluding to\nher former husband.",
        "“Yes, I have.”",
        "“And how was he a-doing?” asked the goody.",
        "“But middling; he cobbles old shoes, and he has nothing but cabbage\nfor victuals.”",
        "“Deary me!” exclaimed the woman. “Didn’t he send a message to me?”",
        "“Yes, he did,” replied Jack Hannaford. “He said that he was out of\nleather, and his pockets were empty, so you were to send him a few\nshillings to buy a fresh stock of leather.”",
        "“He shall have them, bless his poor soul!” And away went the wife to\nthe parlour chimney, and she pulled the rag with the ten pounds in it\nfrom the chimney, and she gave the whole sum to the soldier, telling\nhim that her old man was to use as much as he wanted, and to send back\nthe rest.",
        "It was not long that Jack waited after receiving the money; he went\noff as fast as he could walk.",
        "Presently the farmer came home and asked for his money. The wife told\nhim that she had sent it by a soldier to her former husband in\nParadise, to buy him leather for cobbling the shoes of the saints and\nangels of Heaven. The farmer was very angry, and he swore that he had\nnever met with such a fool as his wife. But the wife said that her\nhusband was a greater fool for letting her have the money.",
        "There was no time to waste words; so the farmer mounted his horse and\nrode off after Jack Hannaford. The old soldier heard the horse’s hoofs\nclattering on the road behind him, so he knew it must be the farmer\npursuing him. He lay down on the ground, and shading his eyes with one\nhand, looked up into the sky, and pointed heavenwards with the other\nhand.",
        "“What are you about there?” asked the farmer, pulling up.",
        "“Lord save you!” exclaimed Jack: “I’ve seen a rare sight.”",
        "“What was that?”",
        "“A man going straight up into the sky, as if he were walking on a\nroad.”",
        "“Can you see him still?”",
        "“Yes, I can.”",
        "“Where?”",
        "“Get off your horse and lie down.”",
        "“If you will hold the horse.”",
        "Jack did so readily.",
        "“I cannot see him,” said the farmer.",
        "“Shade your eyes with your hand, and you’ll soon see a man flying away\nfrom you.”",
        "Sure enough he did so, for Jack leaped on the horse, and rode away\nwith it. The farmer walked home without his horse.",
        "“You are a bigger fool than I am,” said the wife; “for I did only one\nfoolish thing, and you have done two.”",
        "Once upon a time there were two king’s daughters lived in a bower near\nthe bonny mill-dams of Binnorie. And Sir William came wooing the\neldest and won her love and plighted troth with glove and with ring.\nBut after a time he looked upon the youngest, with her cherry cheeks\nand golden hair, and his love grew towards her till he cared no longer\nfor the eldest one. So she hated her sister for taking away Sir\nWilliam’s love, and day by day her hate grew upon her, and she plotted\nand she planned how to get rid of her.",
        "So one fine morning, fair and clear, she said to her sister, “Let us\ngo and see our father’s boats come in at the bonny mill-stream of\nBinnorie.” So they went there hand in hand. And when they got to the\nriver’s bank the youngest got upon a stone to watch for the coming of\nthe boats. And her sister, coming behind her, caught her round the\nwaist and dashed her into the rushing mill-stream of Binnorie.",
        "“O sister, sister, reach me your hand!” she cried, as she floated\naway, “and you shall have half of all I’ve got or shall get.”",
        "“No, sister, I’ll reach you no hand of mine, for I am the heir to all\nyour land. Shame on me if I touch the hand that has come ’twixt me and\nmy own heart’s love.”",
        "“O sister, O sister, then reach me your glove!” she cried, as she\nfloated further away, “and you shall have your William again.”",
        "“Sink on,” cried the cruel princess, “no hand or glove of mine you’ll\ntouch. Sweet William will be all mine when you are sunk beneath the\nbonny mill-stream of Binnorie.” And she turned and went home to the\nking’s castle.",
        "And the princess floated down the mill-stream, sometimes swimming and\nsometimes sinking, till she came near the mill. Now the miller’s\ndaughter was cooking that day, and needed water for her cooking. And\nas she went to draw it from the stream, she saw something floating\ntowards the mill-dam, and she called out, “Father! father! draw your\ndam. There’s something white–a merry maid or a milk-white swan–\ncoming down the stream.” So the miller hastened to the dam and stopped\nthe heavy cruel mill-wheels. And then they took out the princess and\nlaid her on the bank.",
        "Fair and beautiful she looked as she lay there. In her golden hair\nwere pearls and precious stones; you could not see her waist for her\ngolden girdle; and the golden fringe of her white dress came down over\nher lily feet. But she was drowned, drowned!",
        "And as she lay there in her beauty a famous harper passed by the mill-\ndam of Binnorie, and saw her sweet pale face. And though he travelled\non far away he never forgot that face, and after many days he came\nback to the bonny mill-stream of Binnorie. But then all he could find\nof her where they had put her to rest were her bones and her golden\nhair. So he made a harp out of her breast-bone and her hair, and\ntravelled on up the hill from the mill-dam of Binnorie, till he came\nto the castle of the king her father.",
        "That night they were all gathered in the castle hall to hear the great\nharper–king and queen, their daughter and son, Sir William and all\ntheir Court. And first the harper sang to his old harp, making them\njoy and be glad or sorrow and weep just as he liked. But while he sang\nhe put the harp he had made that day on a stone in the hall. And\npresently it began to sing by itself, low and clear, and the harper\nstopped and all were hushed.",
        "And this was what the harp sung:",
        "  “O yonder sits my father, the king,\n    Binnorie, O Binnorie;\n  And yonder sits my mother, the queen;\n    By the bonny mill-dams o’ Binnorie,",
        "  “And yonder stands my brother Hugh,\n    Binnorie, O Binnorie;\n  And by him, my William, false and true;\n    By the bonny mill-dams o’ Binnorie.”",
        "Then they all wondered, and the harper told them how he had seen the\nprincess lying drowned on the bank near the bonny mill-dams o’\nBinnorie, and how he had afterwards made this harp out of her hair and\nbreast-bone. Just then the harp began singing again, and this was what\nit sang out loud and clear:",
        "  “And there sits my sister who drownèd me\n  By the bonny mill-dams o’ Binnorie.”",
        "And the harp snapped and broke, and never sang more.",

        "Well, there was once a very rich gentleman, and he’d three daughters,\nand he thought he’d see how fond they were of him. So he says to the\nfirst, “How much do you love me, my dear?”",
        "“Why,” says she, “as I love my life.”",
        "“That’s good,” says he.",

        "“Why,” says she, “better nor all the world.”",
        "“That’s good,” says he.",
        "So he says to the third, “How much do you love me, my dear?”",
        "“Why, I love you as fresh meat loves salt,” says she.",
        "Well, he was that angry. “You don’t love me at all,” says he, “and in\nmy house you stay no more.” So he drove her out there and then, and\nshut the door in her face.",
        "Well, she went away on and on till she came to a fen, and there she\ngathered a lot of rushes and made them into a kind of a sort of a\ncloak with a hood, to cover her from head to foot, and to hide her\nfine clothes. And then she went on and on till she came to a great\nhouse.",
        "“Do you want a maid?” says she.",
        "“No, we don’t,” said they.",
        "“I haven’t nowhere to go,” says she; “and I ask no wages, and do any\nsort of work,” says she.",
        "“Well,” says they, “if you like to wash the pots and scrape the\nsaucepans you may stay,” said they.",
        "So she stayed there and washed the pots and scraped the saucepans and\ndid all the dirty work. And because she gave no name they called her\n\"Cap o’ Rushes.”",
        "Well, one day there was to be a great dance a little way off, and the\nservants were allowed to go and look on at the grand people. Cap o’\nRushes said she was too tired to go, so she stayed at home.",
        "But when they were gone she offed with her cap o’ rushes, and cleaned\nherself, and went to the dance. And no one there was so finely dressed\nas her.",
        "Well, who should be there but her master’s son, and what should he do\nbut fall in love with her the minute he set eyes on her. He wouldn’t\ndance with any one else.",

        "Well, come this evening, Cap o’ Rushes said she was too tired to go,\nand do what they would she stayed at home. But when they were gone she\noffed with her cap o’ rushes and cleaned herself, and away she went to\nthe dance.",
        "The master’s son was rarely glad when he saw her. He danced with none\nbut her and never took his eyes off her. When she wouldn’t tell him\nher name, nor where she came from, he gave her a ring and told her if\nhe didn’t see her again he should die.",
        "Well, before the dance was over, off she slipped, and home she went,\nand when the maids came home she was pretending to be asleep with her\ncap o’ rushes on.",

        "The master’s son he tried every way to find out where the lady was\ngone, but go where he might, and ask whom he might, he never heard\nanything about her. And he got worse and worse for the love of her\ntill he had to keep his bed.",
        "“Make some gruel for the young master,” they said to the cook. “He’s\ndying for the love of the lady.” The cook she set about making it when\nCap o’ Rushes came in.",
        "“What are you a-doing of?”, says she.",
        "“I’m going to make some gruel for the young master,” says the cook,\n\"for he’s dying for love of the lady.”",
        "“Let me make it,” says Cap o’ Rushes.",
        "Well, the cook wouldn’t at first, but at last she said yes, and Cap o’\nRushes made the gruel. And when she had made it she slipped the ring\ninto it on the sly before the cook took it upstairs.",
        "The young man he drank it and then he saw the ring at the bottom.",
        "“Send for the cook,” says he.",
        "So up she comes.",
        "“Who made this gruel here?” says he.",
        "“I did,” says the cook, for she was frightened.",
        "And he looked at her,",
        "“No, you didn’t,” says he. “Say who did it, and you shan’t be harmed.”",
        "“Well, then, ’twas Cap o’ Rushes,” says she.",
        "“Send Cap o’ Rushes here,” says he.",
        "So Cap o’ Rushes came.",

        "“From him that gave it me,” says she.",
        "“Who are you, then?” says the young man.",
        "“I’ll show you,” says she. And she offed with her cap o’ rushes, and\nthere she was in her beautiful clothes.",
        "Well, the master’s son he got well very soon, and they were to be\nmarried in a little time. It was to be a very grand wedding, and every\none was asked far and near. And Cap o’ Rushes’ father was asked. But\nshe never told anybody who she was.",
        "But before the wedding she went to the cook, and says she:",
        "“I want you to dress every dish without a mite o’ salt.”",
        "“That’ll be rare nasty,” says the cook.",
        "“That doesn’t signify,” says she.",
        "“Very well,” says the cook.",
        "Well, the wedding-day came, and they were married. And after they were\nmarried all the company sat down to the dinner. When they began to eat\nthe meat, that was so tasteless they couldn’t eat it. But Cap o’\nRushes’ father he tried first one dish and then another, and then he\nburst out crying.",
        "“What is the matter?” said the master’s son to him.",
        "“Oh!” says he, “I had a daughter. And I asked her how much she loved\nme. And she said ’As much as fresh meat loves salt.’ And I turned her\nfrom my door, for I thought she didn’t love me. And now I see she\nloved me best of all. And she may be dead for aught I know.”",
        "“No, father, here she is!” says Cap o’ Rushes. And she goes up to him\nand puts her arms round him.",

        "There was once upon a time a poor widow who had an only son named\nJack, and a cow named Milky-white. And all they had to live on was the\nmilk the cow gave every morning which they carried to the market and\nsold. But one morning Milky-white gave no milk and they didn’t know\nwhat to do.",
        "“What shall we do, what shall we do?” said the widow, wringing her\nhands.",
        "“Cheer up, mother, I’ll go and get work somewhere,” said Jack.",
        "“We’ve tried that before, and nobody would take you,” said his mother;\n\"we must sell Milky-white and with the money do something, start shop,\nor something.”",
        "“All right, mother,” says Jack; “it’s market-day today, and I’ll soon\nsell Milky-white, and then we’ll see what we can do.”",
        "So he took the cow’s halter in his hand, and off he starts. He hadn’t\ngone far when he met a funny-looking old man who said to him: “Good\nmorning, Jack.”",
        "“Good morning to you,” said Jack, and wondered how he knew his name.",
        "“Well, Jack, and where are you off to?” said the man.",
        "“I’m going to market to sell our cow here.”",
        "“Oh, you look the proper sort of chap to sell cows,” said the man; “I\nwonder if you know how many beans make five.”",
        "“Two in each hand and one in your mouth,” says Jack, as sharp as a\nneedle.",
        "“Right you are,” said the man, “and here they are the very beans\nthemselves,” he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of strange-\nlooking beans. “As you are so sharp,” says he, “I don’t mind doing a\nswop with you–your cow for these beans.”",
        "“Walker!” says Jack; “wouldn’t you like it?”",
        "“Ah! you don’t know what these beans are,” said the man; “if you plant\nthem over-night, by morning they grow right up to the sky.”",
        "“Really?” says Jack; “you don’t say so.”",
        "“Yes, that is so, and if it doesn’t turn out to be true you can have\nyour cow back.”",
        "“Right,” says Jack, and hands him over Milky-white’s halter and\npockets the beans.",
        "Back goes Jack home, and as he hadn’t gone very far it wasn’t dusk by\nthe time he got to his door.",
        "“What back, Jack?” said his mother; “I see you haven’t got Milky-\nwhite, so you’ve sold her. How much did you get for her?”",
        "“You’ll never guess, mother,” says Jack.",
        "“No, you don’t say so. Good boy! Five pounds, ten, fifteen, no, it\ncan’t be twenty.”",
        "“I told you you couldn’t guess, what do you say to these beans;\nthey’re magical, plant them over-night and––”",
        "“What!” says Jack’s mother, “have you been such a fool, such a dolt,\nsuch an idiot, as to give away my Milky-white, the best milker in the\nparish, and prime beef to boot, for a set of paltry beans. Take that!\nTake that! Take that! And as for your precious beans here they go out\nof the window. And now off with you to bed. Not a sup shall you drink,\nand not a bit shall you swallow this very night.”",
        "So Jack went upstairs to his little room in the attic, and sad and\nsorry he was, to be sure, as much for his mother’s sake, as for the\nloss of his supper.",
        "At last he dropped off to sleep.",
        "When he woke up, the room looked so funny. The sun was shining into\npart of it, and yet all the rest was quite dark and shady. So Jack\njumped up and dressed himself and went to the window. And what do you\nthink he saw? why, the beans his mother had thrown out of the window\ninto the garden, had sprung up into a big beanstalk which went up and\nup and up till it reached the sky. So the man spoke truth after all.",
        "The beanstalk grew up quite close past Jack’s window, so all he had to\ndo was to open it and give a jump on to the beanstalk which was made\nlike a big plaited ladder. So Jack climbed and he climbed and he\nclimbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed\ntill at last he reached the sky. And when he got there he found a long\nbroad road going as straight as a dart. So he walked along and he\nwalked along and he walked along till he came to a great big tall\nhouse, and on the doorstep there was a great big tall woman.",
        "“Good morning, mum,” says Jack, quite polite-like. “Could you be so\nkind as to give me some breakfast.” For he hadn’t had anything to eat,\nyou know, the night before and was as hungry as a hunter.",
        "“It’s breakfast you want, is it?” says the great big tall woman, “it’s\nbreakfast you’ll be if you don’t move off from here. My man is an ogre\nand there’s nothing he likes better than boys broiled on toast. You’d\nbetter be moving on or he’ll soon be coming.”",
        "“Oh! please mum, do give me something to eat, mum. I’ve had nothing to\neat since yesterday morning, really and truly, mum,” says Jack. “I may\nas well be broiled, as die of hunger.”",
        "Well, the ogre’s wife wasn’t such a bad sort, after all. So she took\nJack into the kitchen, and gave him a junk of bread and cheese and a\njug of milk. But Jack hadn’t half finished these when thump! thump!\nthump! the whole house began to tremble with the noise of someone\ncoming.",
        "“Goodness gracious me! It’s my old man,” said the ogre’s wife, “what\non earth shall I do? Here, come quick and jump in here.” And she\nbundled Jack into the oven just as the ogre came in.",
        "He was a big one, to be sure. At his belt he had three calves strung\nup by the heels, and he unhooked them and threw them down on the table\nand said: “Here, wife, broil me a couple of these for breakfast. Ah\nwhat’s this I smell?",
        "  Fee-fi-fo-fum,\n  I smell the blood of an Englishman,\n  Be he alive, or be he dead\n  I’ll have his bones to grind my bread.”",
        "“Nonsense, dear,” said his wife, “you’re dreaming. Or perhaps you\nsmell the scraps of that little boy you liked so much for yesterday’s\ndinner. Here, go you and have a wash and tidy up, and by the time you\ncome back your breakfast’ll be ready for you.”",
        "So the ogre went off, and Jack was just going to jump out of the oven\nand run off when the woman told him not. “Wait till he’s asleep,” says\nshe; “he always has a snooze after breakfast.”",
        "Well, the ogre had his breakfast, and after that he goes to a big\nchest and takes out of it a couple of bags of gold and sits down\ncounting them till at last his head began to nod and he began to snore\ntill the whole house shook again.",
        "Then Jack crept out on tiptoe from his oven, and as he was passing the\nogre he took one of the bags of gold under his arm, and off he pelters\ntill he came to the beanstalk, and then he threw down the bag of gold\nwhich of course fell in to his mother’s garden, and then he climbed\ndown and climbed down till at last he got home and told his mother and\nshowed her the gold and said: “Well, mother, wasn’t I right about the\nbeans. They are really magical, you see.”",
        "So they lived on the bag of gold for some time, but at last they came\nto the end of that so Jack made up his mind to try his luck once more\nup at the top of the beanstalk. So one fine morning he got up early,\nand got on to the beanstalk, and he climbed and he climbed and he\nclimbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed till at last he\ngot on the road again and came to the great big tall house he had been\nto before. There, sure enough, was the great big tall woman a-standing\non the door-step.",
        "“Good morning, mum,” says Jack, as bold as brass, “could you be so\ngood as to give me something to eat?”",
        "“Go away, my boy,” said the big, tall woman, “or else my man will eat\nyou up for breakfast. But aren’t you the youngster who came here once\nbefore? Do you know, that very day, my man missed one of his bags of\ngold.”",
        "“That’s strange, mum,” says Jack, “I dare say I could tell you\nsomething about that but I’m so hungry I can’t speak till I’ve had\nsomething to eat.”",
        "Well the big tall woman was that curious that she took him in and gave\nhim something to eat. But he had scarcely begun munching it as slowly\nas he could when thump! thump! thump! they heard the giant’s footstep,\nand his wife hid Jack away in the oven.",
        "All happened as it did before. In came the ogre as he did before,\nsaid: “Fee-fi-fo-fum,” and had his breakfast off three broiled oxen.\nThen he said: “Wife, bring me the hen that lays the golden eggs.” So\nshe brought it, and the ogre said: “Lay,” and it laid an egg all of\ngold. And then the ogre began to nod his head, and to snore till the\nhouse shook.",
        "Then Jack crept out of the oven on tiptoe and caught hold of the\ngolden hen, and was off before you could say “Jack Robinson.” But this\ntime the hen gave a cackle which woke the ogre, and just as Jack got\nout of the house he heard him calling: “Wife, wife, what have you done\nwith my golden hen?”",
        "And the wife said: “Why, my dear?”",
        "But that was all Jack heard, for he rushed off to the beanstalk and\nclimbed down like a house on fire. And when he got home he showed his\nmother the wonderful hen and said “Lay,” to it; and it laid a golden\negg every time he said “Lay.”",
        "Well, Jack was not content, and it wasn’t very long before he\ndetermined to have another try at his luck up there at the top of the\nbeanstalk. So one fine morning, he got up early, and went on to the\nbeanstalk, and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and he climbed\ntill he got to the top. But this time he knew better than to go\nstraight to the ogre’s house. And when he got near it he waited behind\na bush till he saw the ogre’s wife come out with a pail to get some\nwater, and then he crept into the house and got into the copper. He\nhadn’t been there long when he heard thump! thump! thump! as before,\nand in come the ogre and his wife.",
        "“Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman,” cried out the\nogre; “I smell him, wife, I smell him.”",
        "“Do you, my dearie?” says the ogre’s wife. “Then if it’s that little\nrogue that stole your gold and the hen that laid the golden eggs he’s\nsure to have got into the oven.” And they both rushed to the oven. But\nJack wasn’t there, luckily, and the ogre’s wife said: “There you are\nagain with your fee-fi-fo-fum. Why of course it’s the laddie you\ncaught last night that I’ve broiled for your breakfast. How forgetful\nI am, and how careless you are not to tell the difference between a\nlive un and a dead un.”",
        "So the ogre sat down to the breakfast and ate it, but every now and\nthen he would mutter: “Well, I could have sworn––” and he’d get up\nand search the larder and the cupboards, and everything, only luckily\nhe didn’t think of the copper.",
        "After breakfast was over, the ogre called out: “Wife, wife, bring me\nmy golden harp.” So she brought it and put it on the table before him.\nThen he said: “Sing!” and the golden harp sang most beautifully. And\nit went on singing till the ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore\nlike thunder.",
        "Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down like a\nmouse and crept on hands and knees till he got to the table when he\ngot up and caught hold of the golden harp and dashed with it towards\nthe door. But the harp called out quite loud: “Master! Master!” and\nthe ogre woke up just in time to see Jack running off with his harp.",
        "Jack ran as fast as he could, and the ogre came rushing after, and\nwould soon have caught him only Jack had a start and dodged him a bit\nand knew where he was going. When he got to the beanstalk the ogre was\nnot more than twenty yards away when suddenly he saw Jack disappear\nlike, and when he got up to the end of the road he saw Jack underneath\nclimbing down for dear life. Well, the ogre didn’t like trusting\nhimself to such a ladder, and he stood and waited, so Jack got another\nstart. But just then the harp cried out: “Master! master!” and the\nogre swung himself down on to the beanstalk which shook with his\nweight. Down climbs Jack, and after him climbed the ogre. By this time\nJack had climbed down and climbed down and climbed down till he was\nvery nearly home. So he called out: “Mother! mother! bring me an axe,\nbring me an axe.” And his mother came rushing out with the axe in her\nhand, but when she came to the beanstalk she stood stock still with\nfright for there she saw the ogre just coming down below the clouds.",
        "But Jack jumped down and got hold of the axe and gave a chop at the\nbeanstalk which cut it half in two. The ogre felt the beanstalk shake\nand quiver so he stopped to see what was the matter. Then Jack gave\nanother chop with the axe, and the beanstalk was cut in two and began\nto topple over. Then the ogre fell down and broke his crown, and the\nbeanstalk came toppling after.",
        "Then Jack showed his mother his golden harp, and what with showing\nthat and selling the golden eggs, Jack and his mother became very\nrich, and he married a great princess, and they lived happy ever\nafter.",
        "  Once upon a time when pigs spoke rhyme\n  And monkeys chewed tobacco,\n  And hens took snuff to make them tough,\n  And ducks went quack, quack, quack, O!",
        "There was an old sow with three little pigs, and as she had not enough\nto keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune. The first that\nwent off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him:",
        "“Please, man, give me that straw to build me a house.”",
        "Which the man did, and the little pig built a house with it. Presently\ncame along a wolf, and knocked at the door, and said:",

        "To which the pig answered:",
        "“No, no, by the hair of my chiny chin chin.”",
        "The wolf then answered to that:",
        "“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.”",
        "So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the\nlittle pig.",
        "The second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze, and said:",
        "“Please, man, give me that furze to build a house.”",
        "Which the man did, and the pig built his house. Then along came the\nwolf, and said:",

        "So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and at last\nhe blew the house down, and he ate up the little pig.",
        "The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and said:",
        "“Please, man, give me those bricks to build a house with.”",
        "So the man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them. So\nthe wolf came, as he did to the other little pigs, and said:",

        "“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.”",
        "Well, he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he\npuffed and huffed; but he could not get the house down. When he\nfound that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the\nhouse down, he said:",
        "“Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.”",
        "“Where?” said the little pig.",
        "“Oh, in Mr. Smith’s Home-field, and if you will be ready tomorrow\nmorning I will call for you, and we will go together, and get some for\ndinner.”",
        "“Very well,” said the little pig, “I will be ready. What time do you\nmean to go?”",
        "“Oh, at six o’clock.”",
        "Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the turnips before the\nwolf came (which he did about six) and who said:",
        "“Little Pig, are you ready?”",
        "The little pig said: “Ready! I have been and come back again, and got\na nice potful for dinner.”",
        "The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to\nthe little pig somehow or other, so he said:",
        "“Little pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.”",
        "“Where?” said the pig.",
        "“Down at Merry-garden,” replied the wolf, “and if you will not deceive\nme I will come for you, at five o’clock tomorrow and get some apples.”",
        "Well, the little pig bustled up the next morning at four o’clock, and\nwent off for the apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but\nhe had further to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he\nwas coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may\nsuppose, frightened him very much. When the wolf came up he said:",
        "“Little pig, what! are you here before me? Are they nice apples?”",
        "“Yes, very,” said the little pig. “I will throw you down one.”",
        "And he threw it so far, that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up,\nthe little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came\nagain, and said to the little pig:",
        "“Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this afternoon, will you go?”",
        "“Oh yes,” said the pig, “I will go; what time shall you be ready?”",
        "“At three,” said the wolf. So the little pig went off before the time\nas usual, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was\ngoing home with, when he saw the wolf coming. Then he could not tell\nwhat to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and by so doing turned\nit round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which\nfrightened the wolf so much, that he ran home without going to the\nfair. He went to the little pig’s house, and told him how frightened\nhe had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.\nThen the little pig said:",
        "“Hah, I frightened you, then. I had been to the fair and bought a\nbutter-churn, and when I saw you, I got into it, and rolled down the\nhill.”",
        "Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would eat\nup the little pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.\nWhen the little pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of\nwater, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming\ndown, took off the cover, and in fell the wolf; so the little pig put\non the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for\nsupper, and lived happy ever afterwards.",
        "There was once a very learned man in the north-country who knew all\nthe languages under the sun, and who was acquainted with all the\nmysteries of creation. He had one big book bound in black calf and\nclasped with iron, and with iron corners, and chained to a table which\nwas made fast to the floor; and when he read out of this book, he\nunlocked it with an iron key, and none but he read from it, for it\ncontained all the secrets of the spiritual world. It told how many\nangels there were in heaven, and how they marched in their ranks, and\nsang in their quires, and what were their several functions, and what\nwas the name of each great angel of might. And it told of the demons,\nhow many of them there were, and what were their several powers, and\ntheir labours, and their names, and how they might be summoned, and\nhow tasks might be imposed on them, and how they might be chained to\nbe as slaves to man.",
        "Now the master had a pupil who was but a foolish lad, and he acted as\nservant to the great master, but never was he suffered to look into\nthe black book, hardly to enter the private room.",
        "One day the master was out, and then the lad, as curious as could be,\nhurried to the chamber where his master kept his wondrous apparatus\nfor changing copper into gold, and lead into silver, and where was his\nmirror in which he could see all that was passing in the world, and\nwhere was the shell which when held to the ear whispered all the words\nthat were being spoken by anyone the master desired to know about. The\nlad tried in vain with the crucibles to turn copper and lead into gold\nand silver–he looked long and vainly into the mirror; smoke and\nclouds passed over it, but he saw nothing plain, and the shell to his\near produced only indistinct murmurings, like the breaking of distant\nseas on an unknown shore. “I can do nothing,” he said; “as I don’t\nknow the right words to utter, and they are locked up in yon book.”",
        "He looked round, and, see! the book was unfastened; the master had\nforgotten to lock it before he went out. The boy rushed to it, and\nunclosed the volume. It was written with red and black ink, and much\nof it he could not understand; but he put his finger on a line and\nspelled it through.",
        "At once the room was darkened, and the house trembled; a clap of\nthunder rolled through the passage and the old room, and there stood\nbefore him a horrible, horrible form, breathing fire, and with eyes\nlike burning lamps. It was the demon Beelzebub, whom he had called up\nto serve him.",
        "“Set me a task!” said he, with a voice like the roaring of an iron\nfurnace.",

        "“Water yon flower,” cried the boy in despair, pointing to a geranium\nwhich stood in a pot on the floor. Instantly the spirit left the room,\nbut in another instant he returned with a barrel on his back, and\npoured its contents over the flower; and again and again he went and\ncame, and poured more and more water, till the floor of the room was\nankle-deep.",
        "“Enough, enough!” gasped the lad; but the demon heeded him not; the\nlad didn’t know the words by which to send him away, and still he\nfetched water.",
        "It rose to the boy’s knees and still more water was poured. It mounted\nto his waist, and Beelzebub still kept on bringing barrels full. It\nrose to his armpits, and he scrambled to the table-top. And now the\nwater in the room stood up to the window and washed against the glass,\nand swirled around his feet on the table. It still rose; it reached\nhis breast. In vain he cried; the evil spirit would not be dismissed,\nand to this day he would have been pouring water, and would have\ndrowned all Yorkshire. But the master remembered on his journey that\nhe had not locked his book, and therefore returned, and at the moment\nwhen the water was bubbling about the pupil’s chin, rushed into the\nroom and spoke the words which cast Beelzebub back into his fiery\nhome.",

        "“Then,” said the little bird, “I’ll moult all my feathers,” so he\nmoulted all his pretty feathers.

        "“Then,” said the little girl, “I’ll spill the milk,” so she dropt the\npitcher and spilt the milk. Now there was an old man just by on the\ntop of a ladder thatching a rick, and when he saw the little girl\nspill the milk, he said: “Little girl, what do you mean by spilling\nthe milk, your little brothers and sisters must go without their\nsupper.” Then said the little girl: “Titty’s dead, and Tatty weeps,\nthe stool hops, and the broom sweeps, the door jars, and the window\ncreaks, the old form runs round the house, the walnut-tree sheds all\nits leaves, the little bird moults all its feathers, and so I spill\nthe milk.”",
        "“Oh!” said the old man, “then I’ll tumble off the ladder and break my\nneck,” so he tumbled off the ladder and broke his neck; and when the\nold man broke his neck, the great walnut-tree fell down with a crash,\nand upset the old form and house, and the house falling knocked the\nwindow out, and the window knocked the door down, and the door upset\nthe broom, and the broom upset the stool, and poor little Tatty Mouse\nwas buried beneath the ruins.",

And when he read about some pretty young women,\nhe used to go mad to see some of them; till one day, when his father\nwas out cutting wood, he told his mother that he wished to go away to\nlook for his living in some other country, and to see some other\npeople besides them two. And he said, “I see nothing at all here but\ngreat trees around me; and if I stay here, maybe I shall go mad before\nI see anything.” The young man’s father was out all this time, when\nthis talk was going on between him and his poor old mother.",
        "The old woman begins by saying to her son before leaving, “Well, well,\nmy poor boy, if you want to go, it’s better for you to go, and God be\nwith you.\"–(The old woman thought for the best when she said that.)–\n\"But stop a bit before you go. Which would you like best for me to\nmake you, a little cake and bless you, or a big cake and curse you?\"\n\"Dear, dear!” said he, “make me a big cake. Maybe I shall be hungry on\nthe road.” The old woman made the big cake, and she went on top of the\nhouse, and she cursed him as far as she could see him.",
        "He presently meets with his father, and the old man says to him:\n\"Where are you going, my poor boy?” when the son told the father the\nsame tale as he told his mother. “Well,” says his father, “I’m sorry\nto see you going away, but if you’ve made your mind to go, it’s better\nfor you to go.”",
        "The poor lad had not gone far, when his father called him back; then\nthe old man drew out of his pocket a golden snuff-box, and said to\nhim: “Here, take this little box, and put it in your pocket, and be\nsure not to open it till you are near your death.” And away went poor\nJack upon his road, and walked till he was tired and hungry, for he\nhad eaten all his cake upon the road; and by this time night was upon\nhim, so he could hardly see his way before him. He could see some\nlight a long way before him, and he made up to it, and found the back\ndoor and knocked at it, till one of the maid-servants came and asked\nhim what he wanted. He said that night was on him, and he wanted to\nget some place to sleep. The maid-servant called him in to the fire,\nand gave him plenty to eat, good meat and bread and beer; and as he\nwas eating his food by the fire, there came the young lady to look at\nhim, and she loved him well and he loved her. And the young lady ran\nto tell her father, and said there was a pretty young man in the back\nkitchen; and immediately the gentleman came to him, and questioned\nhim, and asked what work he could do. Jack said, the silly fellow,\nthat he could do anything. (He meant that he could do any foolish bit\nof work, that would be wanted about the house.)",
        "“Well,” says the gentleman to him, “if you can do anything, at eight\no’clock in the morning I must have a great lake and some of-the\nlargest man-of-war vessels sailing before my mansion, and one of the\nlargest vessels must fire a royal salute, and the last round must\nbreak the leg of the bed where my young daughter is sleeping. And if\nyou don’t do that, you will have to forfeit your life.”",
        "“All right,” said Jack; and away he went to his bed, and said his\nprayers quietly, and slept till it was near eight o’clock, and he had\nhardly any time to think what he was to do, till all of a sudden he\nremembered about the little golden box that his father gave him. And\nhe said to himself: “Well, well, I never was so near my death as I am\nnow;” and then he felt in his pocket, and drew the little box out. And\nwhen he opened it, out there hopped three little red men, and asked\nJack: “What is your will with us?” “Well,” said Jack, “I want a great\nlake and some of the largest man-of-war vessels in the world before\nthis mansion, and one of the largest vessels to fire a royal salute,\nand the last round to break one of the legs of the bed where this\nyoung lady is sleeping.” “All right,” said the little men; “go to\nsleep.”",
        "Jack had hardly time to bring the words out of his mouth, to tell the\nlittle men what to do, but what it struck eight o’clock, when Bang,\nbang went one of the largest man-of-war vessels; and it made Jack jump\nout of bed to look through the window; and I can assure you it was a\nwonderful sight for him to see, after being so long with his father\nand mother living in a wood.",
        "By this time Jack dressed himself, and said his prayers, and came down\nlaughing; for he was proud, he was, because the thing was done so\nwell. The gentleman comes to him, and says to him: “Well, my young\nman, I must say that you are very clever indeed. Come and have some\nbreakfast.” And the gentleman tells him, “Now there are two more\nthings you have to do, and then you shall have my daughter in\nmarriage.” Jack gets his breakfast, and has a good squint at the\nyoung lady, and also she at him.",
        "The other thing that the gentleman told him to do was to fell all the\ngreat trees for miles around by eight o’clock in the morning; and, to\nmake my long story short, it was done, and it pleased the gentleman\nwell The gentleman said to him: “The other thing you have to do\"–(and\nit was the last thing)–\"you must get me a great castle standing on\ntwelve golden pillars; and there must come regiments of soldiers and\ngo through their drill. At eight o’clock the commanding officer must\nsay, ’Shoulder up.’” “All right,” said Jack; when the third and last\nmorning came the third great feat was finished, and he had the young\ndaughter in marriage. But, oh dear! there is worse to come yet.",
        "The gentleman now makes a large hunting party, and invites all the\ngentlemen around the country to it, and to see the castle as well. And\nby this time Jack has a beautiful horse and a scarlet dress to go with\nthem. On that morning his valet, when putting Jack’s clothes by, after\nchanging them to go a hunting, put his hand in one of Jack’s\nwaistcoat-pockets, and pulled out the little golden snuffbox, as poor\nJack left behind in a mistake. And that man opened the little box, and\nthere hopped the three little red men out, and asked him what he\nwanted with them. “Well,” said the valet to them, “I want this castle\nto be moved from this place far and far across the sea.” “All right,\"\nsaid the little red men to him; “do you wish to go with it?” “Yes,\"\nsaid he. “Well, get up,” said they to him; and away they went far and\nfar over the great sea.",
        "Now the grand hunting party comes back, and the castle upon the twelve\ngolden pillars had disappeared, to the great disappointment of those\ngentlemen as did not see it before. That poor silly Jack is threatened\nby taking his beautiful young wife from him, for taking them in in the\nway he did. But the gentleman at last made an agreement with him, and\nhe is to have a twelvemonths and a day to look for it; and off he goes\nwith a good horse and money in his pocket.",
        "Now poor Jack goes in search of his missing castle, over hills, dales,\nvalleys, and mountains, through woolly woods and sheepwalks, further\nthan I can tell you or ever intend to tell you. Until at last he comes\nup to the place where lives the King of all the little mice in the\nworld. There was one of the little mice on sentry at the front gate\ngoing up to the palace, and did try to stop Jack from going in. He\nasked the little mouse: “Where does the King live? I should like to\nsee him.” This one sent another with him to show him the place; and\nwhen the King saw him, he called him in. And the King questioned him,\nand asked him where he was going that way. Well, Jack told him all the\ntruth, that he had lost the great castle, and was going to look for\nit, and he had a whole twelvemonths and a day to find it out. And Jack\nasked him whether he knew anything about it; and the King said: “No,\nbut I am the King of all the little mice in the world, and I will call\nthem all up in the morning, and maybe they have seen something of it.”",
        "Then Jack got a good meal and bed, and in the morning he and the King\nwent on to the fields; and the King called all the mice together, and\nasked them whether they had seen the great beautiful castle standing\non golden pillars. And all the little mice said, No, there was none of\nthem had seen it. The old King said to him that he had two other\nbrothers: “One is the King of all the frogs; and my other brother, who\nis the oldest, he is the King of all the birds in the world. And if\nyou go there, may be they know something about the missing castle.\"\nThe King said to him: “Leave your horse here with me till you come\nback, and take one of my best horses under you, and give this cake to\nmy brother; he will know then who you got it from. Mind and tell him I\nam well, and should like dearly to see him.” And then the King and\nJack shook hands together.",
        "And when Jack was going through the gates, the little mouse asked him,\nshould he go with him; and Jack said to him: “No, I shall get myself\ninto trouble with the King.” And the little thing told him: “It will\nbe better for you to let me go with you; maybe I shall do some good to\nyou some time without you knowing it.” “Jump up, then.” And the little\nmouse ran up the horse’s leg, and made it dance; and Jack put the\nmouse in his pocket.",
        "Now Jack, after wishing good morning to the King and pocketing the\nlittle mouse which was on sentry, trudged on his way; and such a long\nway he had to go and this was his first day. At last he found the\nplace; and there was one of the frogs on sentry, and gun upon his\nshoulder, and did try to hinder Jack from going in; but when Jack said\nto him that he wanted to see the King, he allowed him to pass; and\nJack made up to the door. The King came out, and asked him his\nbusiness; and Jack told him all from beginning to end. “Well, well,\ncome in.” He gets good entertainment that night; and in the morning\nthe King made such a funny sound, and collected all the frogs in the\nworld. And he asked them, did they know or see anything of a castle\nthat stood upon twelve golden pillars; and they all made a curious\nsound, Kro-kro, kro-kro, and said, No.",
        "Jack had to take another horse, and a cake to this King’s brother, who\nis the King of all the fowls of the air; and as Jack was going through\nthe gates, the little frog that was on sentry asked John should he go\nwith him. Jack refused him for a bit; but at last he told him to jump\nup, and Jack put him in his other waistcoat pocket. And away he went\nagain on his great long journey; it was three times as long this time\nas it was the first day; however, he found the place, and there was a\nfine bird on sentry. And Jack passed him, and he never said a word to\nhim; and he talked with the King, and told him everything, all about\nthe castle. “Well,” said the King to him, “you shall know in the\nmorning from my birds, whether they know anything or not.” Jack put up\nhis horse in the stable, and then went to bed, after having something\nto eat. And when he got up in the morning the King and he went on to\nsome field, and there the King made some funny noise, and there came\nall the fowls that were in all the world. And the King asked them;\n\"Did they see the fine castle?” and all the birds answered, No.\n\"Well,” said the King, “where is the great bird?” They had to wait\nthen for a long time for the eagle to make his appearance, when at\nlast he came all in a perspiration, after sending two little birds\nhigh up in the sky to whistle on him to make all the haste he possibly\ncould. The King asked the great bird, Did he see the great castle? and\nthe bird said: “Yes, I came from there where it now is.” “Well,” says\nthe King to him; “this young gentleman has lost it, and you must go\nwith him back to it; but stop till you get a bit of something to eat\nfirst.”",
        "They killed a thief, and sent the best part of it to feed the eagle on\nhis journey over the seas, and had to carry Jack on his back. Now when\nthey came in sight of the castle, they did not know what to do to get\nthe little golden box. Well, the little mouse said to them: “Leave me\ndown, and I will get the little box for you.” So the mouse stole into\nthe castle, and got hold of the box; and when he was coming down the\nstairs, it fell down, and he was very near being caught. He came\nrunning out with it, laughing his best. “Have you got it?” Jack said\nto him; he said: “Yes;” and off they went back again, and left the\ncastle behind.",
        "As they were all of them (Jack, mouse, frog, and eagle) passing over\nthe great sea, they fell to quarrelling about which it was that got\nthe little box, till down it slipped into the water. (It was by them\nlooking at it and handing it from one hand to the other that they\ndropped the little box to the bottom of the sea.) “Well, well,” said\nthe frog, “I knew that I would have to do something, so you had better\nlet me go down in the water.” And they let him go, and he was down for\nthree days and three nights; and up he comes, and shows his nose and\nlittle mouth out of the water; and all of them asked him, Did he get\nit? and he told them, No. “Well, what are you doing there, then?\"\n\"Nothing at all,” he said, “only I want my full breath;” and the poor\nlittle frog went down the second time, and he was down for a day and a\nnight, and up he brings it.",
        "And away they did go, after being there four days and nights; and\nafter a long tug over seas and mountains, arrive at the palace of the\nold King, who is the master of all the birds in the world. And the\nKing is very proud to see them, and has a hearty welcome and a long\nconversation. Jack opens the little box, and told the little men to go\nback and to bring the castle here to them; “and all of you make as\nmuch haste back again as you possibly can.”",
        "The three little men went off; and when they came near the castle they\nwere afraid to go to it till the gentleman and lady and all the\nservants were gone out to some dance. And there was no one left behind\nthere only the cook and another maid with her; and the little red men\nasked them which would they rather–go, or stop behind? and they both\nsaid: “I will go with you;” and the little men told them to run\nupstairs quick. They were no sooner up and in one of the drawing-rooms\nthan here comes just in sight the gentleman and lady and all the\nservants; but it was too late. Off the castle went at full speed, with\nthe women laughing at them through the window, while they made motions\nfor them to stop, but all to no purpose.",
        "They were nine days on their journey, in which they did try to keep\nthe Sunday holy, when one of the little men turned to be the priest,\nthe other the clerk, and third presided at the organ, and the women\nwere the singers, for they had a grand chapel in the castle already.\nVery remarkable, there was a discord made in the music, and one of the\nlittle men ran up one of the organ-pipes to see where the bad sound\ncame from, when he found out it only happened to be that the two women\nwere laughing at the little red man stretching his little legs full\nlength on the bass pipes, also his two arms the same time, with his\nlittle red night-cap, which he never forgot to wear, and what they\nnever witnessed before, could not help calling forth some good\nmerriment while on the face of the deep. And poor thing! through them\nnot going on with what they begun with, they very near came to danger,\nas the castle was once very near sinking in the middle of the sea.",
        "At length, after a merry journey, they come again to Jack and the\nKing. The King was quite struck with the sight of the castle; and\ngoing up the golden stairs, went to see the inside.",
        "The King was very much pleased with the castle, but poor Jack’s time\nof a twelvemonths and a day was drawing to a close; and he, wishing to\ngo home to his young wife, gives orders to the three little men to get\nready by the next morning at eight o’clock to be off to the next\nbrother, and to stop there for one night; also to proceed from there\nto the last or the youngest brother, the master of all the mice in the\nworld, in such place where the castle shall be left under his care\nuntil it’s sent for. Jack takes a farewell of the King, and thanks him\nvery much for his hospitality.",
        "Away went Jack and his castle again, and stopped one night in that\nplace; and away they went again to the third place, and there left the\ncastle under his care. As Jack had to leave the castle behind, he had\nto take to his own horse, which he left there when he first started.",
        "Now poor Jack leaves his castle behind and faces towards home; and\nafter having so much merriment with the three brothers every night,\nJack became sleepy on horseback, and would have lost the road if it\nwas not for the little men a-guiding him. At last he arrived weary and\ntired, and they did not seem to receive him with any kindness\nwhatever, because he had not found the stolen castle; and to make it\nworse, he was disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife\nto come and meet him, through being hindered by her parents. But that\ndid not stop long. Jack put full power on and despatched the little\nmen off to bring the castle from there, and they soon got there.",
        "Jack shook hands with the King, and returned many thanks for his\nkingly kindness in minding the castle for him; and then Jack\ninstructed the little men to spur up and put speed on. And off they\nwent, and were not long before they reached their journey’s end, when\nout comes the young wife to meet him with a fine lump of a young SON,\nand they all lived happy ever afterwards.",
        "Once upon a time there were Three Bears, who lived together in a house\nof their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little, Small Wee Bear; and\none was a Middle-sized Bear, and the other was a Great, Huge Bear.\nThey had each a pot for their porridge, a little pot for the Little,\nSmall, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized pot for the Middle Bear, and a\ngreat pot for the Great, Huge Bear. And they had each a chair to sit\nin; a little chair for the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized\nchair for the Middle Bear; and a great chair for the Great, Huge Bear.\nAnd they had each a bed to sleep in; a little bed for the Little,\nSmall, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized bed for the Middle Bear; and a\ngreat bed for the Great, Huge Bear.",
        "One day, after they had made the porridge for their breakfast, and\npoured it into their porridge-pots, they walked out into the wood\nwhile the porridge was cooling, that they might not burn their mouths,\nby beginning too soon to eat it. And while they were walking, a little\nold Woman came to the house. She could not have been a good, honest\nold Woman; for first she looked in at the window, and then she peeped\nin at the keyhole; and seeing nobody in the house, she lifted the\nlatch. The door was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears,\nwho did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm\nthem. So the little old Woman opened the door, and went in; and well\npleased she was when she saw the porridge on the table. If she had\nbeen a good little old Woman, she would have waited till the Bears\ncame home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to breakfast;\nfor they were good Bears–a little rough or so, as the manner of\nBears is, but for all that very good-natured and hospitable. But she\nwas an impudent, bad old Woman, and set about helping herself.",
        "So first she tasted the porridge of the Great, Huge Bear, and that was\ntoo hot for her; and she said a bad word about that. And then she\ntasted the porridge of the Middle Bear, and that was too cold for her;\nand she said a bad word about that too. And then she went to the\nporridge of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and tasted that; and that was\nneither too hot, nor too cold, but just right; and she liked it so\nwell, that she ate it all up: but the naughty old Woman said a bad\nword about the little porridge-pot, because it did not hold enough for\nher.",
        "Then the little old Woman sate down in the chair of the Great, Huge\nBear, and that was too hard for her. And then she sate down in the\nchair of the Middle Bear, and that was too soft for her. And then she\nsate down in the chair of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and that was\nneither too hard, nor too soft, but just right. So she seated herself\nin it, and there she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and\ndown she came, plump upon the ground. And the naughty old Woman said a\nwicked word about that too.",
        "Then the little old Woman went upstairs into the bed-chamber in which\nthe three Bears slept. And first she lay down upon the bed of the\nGreat, Huge Bear; but that was too high at the head for her. And next\nshe lay down upon the bed of the Middle Bear; and that was too high at\nthe foot for her. And then she lay down upon the bed of the Little,\nSmall, Wee Bear; and that was neither too high at the head, nor at the\nfoot, but just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay\nthere till she fell fast asleep.",
        "By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be cool\nenough; so they came home to breakfast. Now the little old Woman had\nleft the spoon of the Great, Huge Bear, standing in his porridge.",
        "“Somebody has been at my porridge!”",
        "said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice. And when\nthe Middle Bear looked at his, he saw that the spoon was standing in\nit too. They were wooden spoons; if they had been silver ones, the\nnaughty old Woman would have put them in her pocket.",
        "“Somebody has been at my porridge!”",
        "said the Middle Bear in his middle voice.",
        "Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked at his, and there was the\nspoon in the porridge-pot, but the porridge was all gone.",
        "“Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all up!”",
        "said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.",
        "Upon this the Three Bears, seeing that some one had entered their\nhouse, and eaten up the Little, Small, Wee Bear’s breakfast, began to\nlook about them. Now the little old Woman had not put the hard cushion\nstraight when she rose from the chair of the Great, Huge Bear.",
        "“Somebody has been sitting in my chair!”",
        "said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.",
        "And the little old Woman had squatted down the soft cushion of the\nMiddle Bear.",
        "“Somebody has been sitting in my chair!”",
        "said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.",
        "And you know what the little old Woman had done to the third chair.",
        "“Somebody has been sitting in my chair and has sate the bottom out of\nit!”",
        "said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.",
        "Then the Three Bears thought it necessary that they should make\nfarther search; so they went upstairs into their bedchamber. Now the\nlittle old Woman had pulled the pillow of the Great, Huge Bear, out of\nits place.",
        "“Somebody has been lying in my bed!”",
        "said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.",
        "And the little old Woman had pulled the bolster of the Middle Bear out\nof its place.",
        "“Somebody has been lying in my bed!”",
        "said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.",
        "And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear came to look at his bed, there\nwas the bolster in its place; and the pillow in its place upon the\nbolster; and upon the pillow was the little old Woman’s ugly, dirty\nhead,–which was not in its place, for she had no business there.",
        "“Somebody has been lying in my bed,–and here she is!”",
        "said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his little, small, wee voice.",
        "The little old Woman had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff\nvoice of the Great, Huge Bear; but she was so fast asleep that it was\nno more to her than the roaring of wind, or the rumbling of thunder.\nAnd she had heard the middle voice, of the Middle Bear, but it was\nonly as if she had heard some one speaking in a dream. But when she\nheard the little, small, wee voice of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, it\nwas so sharp, and so shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she\nstarted; and when she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she\ntumbled herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the\nwindow was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears, as they\nwere, always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the\nmorning. Out the little old Woman jumped; and whether she broke her\nneck in the fall; or ran into the wood and was lost there; or found\nher way out of the wood, and was taken up by the constable and sent to\nthe House of Correction for a vagrant as she was, I cannot tell. But\nthe Three Bears never saw anything more of her.",
        "When good King Arthur reigned, there lived near the Land’s End of\nEngland, in the county of Cornwall, a farmer who had one only son\ncalled Jack. He was brisk and of a ready lively wit, so that nobody or\nnothing could worst him.",
        "In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a huge giant named\nCormoran. He was eighteen feet in height, and about three yards round\nthe waist, of a fierce and grim countenance, the terror of all the\nneighbouring towns and villages. He lived in a cave in the midst of\nthe Mount, and whenever he wanted food he would wade over to the main-\nland, where he would furnish himself with whatever came in his way.\nEverybody at his approach ran out of their houses, while he seized on\ntheir cattle, making nothing of carrying half-a-dozen oxen on his back\nat a time; and as for their sheep and hogs, he would tie them round\nhis waist like a bunch of tallow-dips. He had done this for many\nyears, so that all Cornwall was in despair.",
        "One day Jack happened to be at the town-hall when the magistrates were\nsitting in council about the Giant. He asked: “What reward will be\ngiven to the man who kills Cormoran?” “The giant’s treasure,” they\nsaid, “will be the reward.” Quoth Jack: “Then let me undertake it.”",
        "So he got a horn, shovel, and pickaxe, and went over to the Mount in\nthe beginning of a dark winter’s evening, when he fell to work, and\nbefore morning had dug a pit twenty-two feet deep, and nearly as\nbroad, covering it over with long sticks and straw. Then he strewed a\nlittle mould over it, so that it appeared like plain ground. Jack then\nplaced himself on the opposite side of the pit, farthest from the\ngiant’s lodging, and, just at the break of day, he put the horn to his\nmouth, and blew, Tantivy, Tantivy. This noise roused the giant, who\nrushed from his cave, crying: “You incorrigible villain, are you come\nhere to disturb my rest? You shall pay dearly for this. Satisfaction I\nwill have, and this it shall be, I will take you whole and broil you\nfor breakfast.” He had no sooner uttered this, than he tumbled into\nthe pit, and made the very foundations of the Mount to shake. “Oh,\nGiant,” quoth Jack, “where are you now? Oh, faith, you are gotten now\ninto Lob’s Pound, where I will surely plague you for your threatening\nwords: what do you think now of broiling me for your breakfast? Will\nno other diet serve you but poor Jack?” Then having tantalised the\ngiant for a while, he gave him a most weighty knock with his pickaxe\non the very crown of his head, and killed him on the spot.",
        "Jack then filled up the pit with earth, and went to search the cave,\nwhich he found contained much treasure. When the magistrates heard of\nthis they made a declaration he should henceforth be termed",
        "and presented him with a sword and a belt, on which were written these\nwords embroidered in letters of gold:",
        "  “Here’s the right valiant Cornish man,\n  Who slew the giant Cormoran.”",
        "The news of Jack’s victory soon spread over all the West of England,\nso that another giant, named Blunderbore, hearing of it, vowed to be\nrevenged on Jack, if ever he should light on him. This giant was the\nlord of an enchanted castle situated in the midst of a lonesome wood.\nNow Jack, about four months afterwards, walking near this wood in his\njourney to Wales, being weary, seated himself near a pleasant fountain\nand fell fast asleep. While he was sleeping, the giant, coming there\nfor water, discovered him, and knew him to be the far-famed Jack the\nGiant-killer by the lines written on the belt. Without ado, he took\nJack on his shoulders and carried him towards his castle. Now, as they\npassed through a thicket, the rustling of the boughs awakened Jack,\nwho was strangely surprised to find himself in the clutches of the\ngiant. His terror was only begun, for, on entering the castle, he saw\nthe ground strewed with human bones, and the giant told him his own\nwould ere long be among them. After this the giant locked poor Jack in\nan immense chamber, leaving him there while he went to fetch another\ngiant, his brother, living in the same wood, who might share in the\nmeal on Jack.",
        "After waiting some time Jack, on going to the window beheld afar off\nthe two giants coming towards the castle. “Now,” quoth Jack to\nhimself, “my death or my deliverance is at hand.” Now, there were\nstrong cords in a corner of the room in which Jack was, and two of\nthese he took, and made a strong noose at the end; and while the\ngiants were unlocking the iron gate of the castle he threw the ropes\nover each of their heads. Then he drew the other ends across a beam,\nand pulled with all his might, so that he throttled them. Then, when\nhe saw they were black in the face, he slid down the rope, and drawing\nhis sword, slew them both. Then, taking the giant’s keys, and\nunlocking the rooms, he found three fair ladies tied by the hair of\ntheir heads, almost starved to death. “Sweet ladies,” quoth Jack, “I\nhave destroyed this monster and his brutish brother, and obtained your\nliberties.” This said he presented them with the keys, and so\nproceeded on his journey to Wales.",
        "Jack made the best of his way by travelling as fast as he could, but\nlost his road, and was benighted, and could find any habitation until,\ncoming into a narrow valley, he found a large house, and in order to\nget shelter took courage to knock at the gate. But what was his\nsurprise when there came forth a monstrous giant with two heads; yet\nhe did not appear so fiery as the others were, for he was a Welsh\ngiant, and what he did was by private and secret malice under the\nfalse show of friendship. Jack, having told his condition to the\ngiant, was shown into a bedroom, where, in the dead of night, he heard\nhis host in another apartment muttering these words:",
        "  “Though here you lodge with me this night,\n  You shall not see the morning light\n  My club shall dash your brains outright!”",
        "“Say’st thou so,” quoth Jack; “that is like one of your Welsh tricks,\nyet I hope to be cunning enough for you.” Then, getting out of bed, he\nlaid a billet in the bed in his stead, and hid himself in a corner of\nthe room. At the dead time of the night in came the Welsh giant, who\nstruck several heavy blows on the bed with his club, thinking he had\nbroken every bone in Jack’s skin. The next morning Jack, laughing in\nhis sleeve, gave him hearty thanks for his night’s lodging. “How have\nyou rested?” quoth the giant; “did you not feel anything in the\nnight?” “No,” quoth Jack, “nothing but a rat, which gave me two or\nthree slaps with her tail.” With that, greatly wondering, the giant\nled Jack to breakfast, bringing him a bowl containing four gallons of\nhasty pudding. Being loth to let the giant think it too much for him,\nJack put a large leather bag under his loose coat, in such a way that\nhe could convey the pudding into it without its being perceived. Then,\ntelling the giant he would show him a trick, taking a knife, Jack\nripped open the bag, and out came all the hasty pudding. Whereupon,\nsaying, “Odds splutters hur nails, hur can do that trick hurself,” the\nmonster took the knife, and ripping open his belly, fell down dead.",
        "Now, it happened in these days that King Arthur’s only son asked his\nfather to give him a large sum of money, in order that he might go and\nseek his fortune in the principality of Wales, where lived a beautiful\nlady possessed with seven evil spirits. The king did his best to\npersuade his son from it, but in vain; so at last gave way and the\nprince set out with two horses, one loaded with money, the other for\nhimself to ride upon. Now, after several days’ travel, he came to a\nmarket-town in Wales, where he beheld a vast crowd of people gathered\ntogether. The prince asked the reason of it, and was told that they\nhad arrested a corpse for several large sums of money which the\ndeceased owed when he died. The prince replied that it was a pity\ncreditors should be so cruel, and said: “Go bury the dead, and let his\ncreditors come to my lodging, and there their debts shall be paid.\"\nThey came, in such great numbers that before night he had only\ntwopence left for himself.",
        "Now Jack the Giant-Killer, coming that way, was so taken with the\ngenerosity of the prince, that he desired to be his servant. This\nbeing agreed upon, the next morning they set forward on their journey\ntogether, when, as they were riding out of the town, an old woman\ncalled after the prince, saying, “He has owed me twopence these seven\nyears; pray pay me as well as the rest.” Putting his hand to his\npocket, the prince gave the woman all he had left, so that after their\nday’s food, which cost what small spell Jack had by him, they were\nwithout a penny between them.",
        "When the sun got low, the king’s son said: “Jack, since we have no\nmoney, where can we lodge this night?”",
        "But Jack replied: “Master, we’ll do well enough, for I have an uncle\nlives within two miles of this place; he is a huge and monstrous giant\nwith three heads; he’ll fight five hundred men in armour, and make\nthem to fly before him.” “Alas!” quoth the prince, “what shall we do\nthere? He’ll certainly chop us up at a mouthful. Nay, we are scarce\nenough to fill one of his hollow teeth!”",
        "“It is no matter for that,” quoth Jack; “I myself will go before and\nprepare the way for you; therefore stop here and wait till I return.\"\nJack then rode away at full speed, and coming to the gate of the\ncastle, he knocked so loud that he made the neighbouring hills\nresound. The giant roared out at this like thunder: “Who’s there?”",
        "Jack answered: “None but your poor cousin Jack.”",
        "Quoth he: “What news with my poor cousin Jack?”",
        "He replied: “Dear uncle, heavy news, God wot!”",
        "“Prithee,” quoth the giant, “what heavy news can come to me? I am a\ngiant with three heads, and besides thou knowest I can fight five\nhundred men in armour, and make them fly like chaff before the wind.”",
        "“Oh, but,” quoth Jack, “here’s the king’s son a-coming with a thousand\nmen in armour to kill you and destroy all that you have!”",
        "“Oh, cousin Jack,” said the giant, “this is heavy news indeed! I will\nimmediately run and hide myself, and thou shalt lock, bolt, and bar me\nin, and keep the keys until the prince is gone.” Having secured the\ngiant, Jack fetched his master, when they made themselves heartily\nmerry whilst the poor giant lay trembling in a vault under the ground.",
        "Early in the morning Jack furnished his master with a fresh supply of\ngold and silver, and then sent him three miles forward on his journey,\nat which time the prince was pretty well out of the smell of the\ngiant. Jack then returned, and let the giant out of the vault, who\nasked what he should give him for keeping the castle from destruction.\n\"Why,” quoth Jack, “I want nothing but the old coat and cap, together\nwith the old rusty sword and slippers which are at your bed’s head.\"\nQuoth the giant: “You know not what you ask; they are the most\nprecious things I have. The coat will keep you invisible, the cap will\ntell you all you want to know, the sword cuts asunder whatever you\nstrike, and the shoes are of extraordinary swiftness. But you have\nbeen very serviceable to me, therefore take them with all my heart.\"\nJack thanked his uncle, and then went off with them. He soon overtook\nhis master and they quickly arrived at the house of the lady the\nprince sought, who, finding the prince to be a suitor, prepared a\nsplendid banquet for him. After the repast was concluded, she told him\nshe had a task for him. She wiped his mouth with a handkerchief,\nsaying: “You must show me that handkerchief to-morrow morning, or else\nyou will lose your head.” With that she put it in her bosom. The\nprince went to bed in great sorrow, but Jack’s cap of knowledge\ninformed him how it was to be obtained. In the middle of the night she\ncalled upon her familiar spirit to carry her to Lucifer. But Jack put\non his coat of darkness and his shoes of swiftness, and was there as\nsoon as she was. When she entered the place of the Old One, she gave\nthe handkerchief to old Lucifer, who laid it upon a shelf, whence Jack\ntook it and brought it to his master, who showed it to the lady next\nday, and so saved his life. On that day, she gave the prince a kiss\nand told him he must show her the lips to-morrow morning that she\nkissed last night, or lose his head.",
        "“Ah!” he replied, “if you kiss none but mine, I will.”",
        "“That is neither here nor there,” said she; “if you do not, death’s\nyour portion!”",
        "At midnight she went as before, and was angry with old Lucifer for\nletting the handkerchief go. “But now,” quoth she, “I will be too hard\nfor the king’s son, for I will kiss thee, and he is to show me thy\nlips.” Which she did, and Jack, when she was not standing by, cut off\nLucifer’s head and brought it under his invisible coat to his master,\nwho the next morning pulled it out by the horns before the lady. This\nbroke the enchantment and the evil spirit left her, and she appeared\nin all her beauty. They were married the next morning, and soon after\nwent to the court of King Arthur, where Jack for his many great\nexploits, was made one of the Knights of the Round Table.",
        "Jack soon went searching for giants again, but he had not ridden far,\nwhen he saw a cave, near the entrance of which he beheld a giant\nsitting upon a block of timber, with a knotted iron club by his side.\nHis goggle eyes were like flames of fire, his countenance grim and\nugly, and his cheeks like a couple of large flitches of bacon, while\nthe bristles of his beard resembled rods of iron wire, and the locks\nthat hung down upon his brawny shoulders were like curled snakes or\nhissing adders. Jack alighted from his horse, and, putting on the coat\nof darkness, went up close to the giant, and said softly: “Oh! are you\nthere? It will not be long before I take you fast by the beard.” The\ngiant all this while could not see him, on account of his invisible\ncoat, so that Jack, coming up close to the monster, struck a blow with\nhis sword at his head, but, missing his aim, he cut off the nose\ninstead. At this, the giant roared like claps of thunder, and began to\nlay about him with his iron club like one stark mad. But Jack, running\nbehind, drove his sword up to the hilt in the giant’s back, so that he\nfell down dead. This done, Jack cut off the giant’s head, and sent it,\nwith his brother’s also, to King Arthur, by a waggoner he hired for\nthat purpose.",
        "Jack now resolved to enter the giant’s cave in search of his treasure,\nand, passing along through a great many windings and turnings, he came\nat length to a large room paved with freestone, at the upper end of\nwhich was a boiling caldron, and on the right hand a large table, at\nwhich the giant used to dine. Then he came to a window, barred with\niron, through which he looked and beheld a vast number of miserable\ncaptives, who, seeing him, cried out: “Alas! young man, art thou come\nto be one amongst us in this miserable den?”",
        "“Ay,” quoth Jack, “but pray tell me what is the meaning of your\ncaptivity?”",
        "“We are kept here,” said one, “till such time as the giants have a\nwish to feast, and then the fattest among us is slaughtered! And many\nare the times they have dined upon murdered men!”",
        "“Say you so,” quoth Jack, and straightway unlocked the gate and let\nthem free, who all rejoiced like condemned men at sight of a pardon.\nThen searching the giant’s coffers, he shared the gold and silver\nequally amongst them and took them to a neighbouring castle, where\nthey all feasted and made merry over their deliverance.",
        "But in the midst of all this mirth a messenger brought news that one\nThunderdell, a giant with two heads, having heard of the death of his\nkinsmen, had come from the northern dales to be revenged on Jack, and\nwas within a mile of the castle, the country people flying before him\nlike chaff. But Jack was not a bit daunted, and said: “Let him come! I\nhave a tool to pick his teeth; and you, ladies and gentlemen, walk out\ninto the garden, and you shall witness this giant Thunderdell’s death\nand destruction.”",
        "The castle was situated in the midst of a small island surrounded by a\nmoat thirty feet deep and twenty feet wide, over which lay a\ndrawbridge. So Jack employed men to cut through this bridge on both\nsides, nearly to the middle; and then, dressing himself in his\ninvisible coat, he marched against the giant with his sword of\nsharpness. Although the giant could not see Jack, he smelt his\napproach, and cried out in these words:",
        "  “Fee, fi, fo, fum!\n  I smell the blood of an Englishman!\n  Be he alive or be he dead,\n  I’ll grind his bones to make me bread!”",
        "“Say’st thou so,” said Jack; “then thou art a monstrous miller\nindeed.”",
        "The giant cried out again: “Art thou that villain who killed my\nkinsmen? Then I will tear thee with my teeth, suck thy blood, and\ngrind thy bones to powder.”",
        "“You’ll have to catch me first,” quoth Jack, and throwing off his\ninvisible coat, so that the giant might see him, and putting on his\nshoes of swiftness, he ran from the giant, who followed like a walking\ncastle, so that the very foundations of the earth seemed to shake at\nevery step. Jack led him a long dance, in order that the gentlemen and\nladies might see; and at last to end the matter, ran lightly over the\ndrawbridge, the giant, in full speed, pursuing him with his club.\nThen, coming to the middle of the bridge, the giant’s great weight\nbroke it down, and he tumbled headlong into the water, where he rolled\nand wallowed like a whale. Jack, standing by the moat, laughed at him\nall the while; but though the giant foamed to hear him scoff, and\nplunged from place to place in the moat, yet he could not get out to\nbe revenged. Jack at length got a cart-rope and cast it over the two\nheads of the giant, and drew him ashore by a team of horses, and then\ncut off both his heads with his sword of sharpness, and sent them to\nKing Arthur.",
        "After some time spent in mirth and pastime, Jack, taking leave of the\nknights and ladies, set out for new adventures. Through many woods he\npassed, and came at length to the foot of a high mountain. Here, late\nat night, he found a lonesome house, and knocked at the door, which\nwas opened by an aged man with a head as white as snow. “Father,” said\nJack, “can you lodge a benighted traveller that has lost his way?\"\n\"Yes,” said the old man; “you are right welcome to my poor cottage.\"\nWhereupon Jack entered, and down they sat together, and the old man\nbegan to speak as follows: “Son, I see by your belt you are the great\nconqueror of giants, and behold, my son, on the top of this mountain\nis an enchanted castle, this is kept by a giant named Galligantua, and\nhe by the help of an old conjurer, betrays many knights and ladies\ninto his castle, where by magic art they are transformed into sundry\nshapes and forms. But above all, I grieve for a duke’s daughter, whom\nthey fetched from her father’s garden, carrying her through the air in\na burning chariot drawn by fiery dragons, when they secured her within\nthe castle, and transformed her into a white hind. And though many\nknights have tried to break the enchantment, and work her deliverance,\nyet no one could accomplish it, on account of two dreadful griffins\nwhich are placed at the castle gate and which destroy every one who\ncomes near. But you, my son, may pass by them undiscovered, where on\nthe gates of the castle you will find engraven in large letters how\nthe spell may be broken.” Jack gave the old man his hand, and promised\nthat in the morning he would venture his life to free the lady.",
        "In the morning Jack arose and put on his invisible coat and magic cap\nand shoes, and prepared himself for the fray. Now, when he had reached\nthe top of the mountain he soon discovered the two fiery griffins, but\npassed them without fear, because of his invisible coat. When he had\ngot beyond them, he found upon the gates of the castle a golden\ntrumpet hung by a silver chain, under which these lines were engraved:",
        "  “Whoever shall this trumpet blow,\n  Shall soon the giant overthrow,\n  And break the black enchantment straight;\n  So all shall be in happy state.”",
        "Jack had no sooner read this but he blew the trumpet, at which the\ncastle trembled to its vast foundations, and the giant and conjurer\nwere in horrid confusion, biting their thumbs and tearing their hair,\nknowing their wicked reign was at an end. Then the giant stooping to\ntake up his club, Jack at one blow cut off his head; whereupon the\nconjurer, mounting up into the air, was carried away in a whirlwind.\nThen the enchantment was broken, and all the lords and ladies who had\nso long been transformed into birds and beasts returned to their\nproper shapes, and the castle vanished away in a cloud of smoke. This\nbeing done, the head of Galligantua was likewise, in the usual manner,\nconveyed to the Court of King Arthur, where, the very next day, Jack\nfollowed, with the knights and ladies who had been delivered.\nWhereupon, as a reward for his good services, the king prevailed upon\nthe duke to bestow his daughter in marriage on honest Jack. So married\nthey were, and the whole kingdom was filled with joy at the wedding.\nFurthermore, the king bestowed on Jack a noble castle, with a very\nbeautiful estate thereto belonging, where he and his lady lived in\ngreat joy and happiness all the rest of their days.",
        "One day Henny-penny was picking up corn in the cornyard when–whack!–\nsomething hit her upon the head. “Goodness gracious me!” said Henny-\npenny; “the sky’s a-going to fall; I must go and tell the king.”",
        "So she went along and she went along and she went along till she met\nCocky-locky. “Where are you going, Henny-penny?” says Cocky-locky.\n\"Oh! I’m going to tell the king the sky’s a-falling,” says Henny-\npenny. “May I come with you?” says Cocky-locky. “Certainly,” says\nHenny-penny. So Henny-penny and Cocky-locky went to tell-the king the\nsky was falling.",
        "They went along, and they went along, and they went along, till they\nmet Ducky-daddles. “Where are you going to, Henny-penny and Cocky-\nlocky?” says Ducky-daddles. “Oh! we’re going to tell the king the\nsky’s a-falling,” said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky. “May I come with\nyou?” says Ducky-daddles. “Certainly,” said Henny-penny and Cocky-\nlocky. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles went to tell the\nking the sky was a-falling.",
        "So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till\nthey met Goosey-poosey, “Where are you going to, Henny-penny, Cocky-\nlocky and Ducky-daddles?” said Goosey-poosey. “Oh! we’re going to\ntell the king the sky’s a-falling,” said Henny-penny and Cocky-locky\nand Ducky-daddles. “May I come with you,” said Goosey-poosey.\n\"Certainly,” said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky and Ducky-daddles. So\nHenny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey went to tell\nthe king the sky was a-falling.",
        "So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till\nthey met Turkey-lurkey. “Where are you going, Henny-penny, Cocky-\nlocky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey?” says Turkey-lurkey. “Oh!\nwe’re going to tell the king the sky’s a-falling,” said Henny-penny,\nCocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey. “May I come with you?\nHenny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles and Goosey-poosey?” said\nTurkey-lurkey. “Why, certainly, Turkey-lurkey,” said Henny-penny,\nCocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, and Goosey-poosey. So Henny-penny, Cocky-\nlocky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey all went to tell\nthe king the sky was a-falling.",
        "So they went along, and they went along, and they went along, till\nthey met Foxy-woxy, and Foxy-woxy said to Henny-penny, Cocky-locky,\nDucky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey: “Where are you going,\nHenny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-\nlurkey?” And Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey,\nand Turkey-lurkey said to Foxy-woxy: “We’re going to tell the king the\nsky’s a-falling.” “Oh! but this is not the way to the king, Henny-\npenny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey and Turkey-lurkey,\"\nsays Foxy-woxy; “I know the proper way; shall I show it you?” “Why\ncertainly, Foxy-woxy,” said Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles,\nGoosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey. So Henny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-\ndaddles, Goosey-poosey, Turkey-lurkey, and Foxy-woxy all went to tell\nthe king the sky was a-falling. So they went along, and they went\nalong, and they went along, till they came to a narrow and dark hole.\nNow this was the door of Foxy-woxy’s cave. But Foxy-woxy said to\nHenny-penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-\nlurkey: “This is the short way to the king’s palace you’ll soon get\nthere if you follow me. I will go first and you come after, Henny-\npenny, Cocky-locky, Ducky daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.\"\n\"Why of course, certainly, without doubt, why not?” said Henny-Penny,\nCocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-poosey, and Turkey-lurkey.",
        "So Foxy-woxy went into his cave, and he didn’t go very far but turned\nround to wait for Henny-Penny, Cocky-locky, Ducky-daddles, Goosey-\npoosey and Turkey-lurkey. So at last at first Turkey-lurkey went\nthrough the dark hole into the cave. He hadn’t got far when “Hrumph,\"\nFoxy-woxy snapped off Turkey-lurkey’s head and threw his body over his\nleft shoulder. Then Goosey-poosey went in, and “Hrumph,” off went her\nhead and Goosey-poosey was thrown beside Turkey-lurkey. Then Ducky-\ndaddles waddled down, and “Hrumph,” snapped Foxy-woxy, and Ducky-\ndaddles’ head was off and Ducky-daddles was thrown alongside Turkey-\nlurkey and Goosey-poosey. Then Cocky-locky strutted down into the cave\nand he hadn’t gone far when “Snap, Hrumph!” went Foxy-woxy and Cocky-\nlocky was thrown alongside of Turkey-lurkey, Goosey-poosey and Ducky-\ndaddles.",
        "But Foxy-woxy had made two bites at Cocky-locky, and when the first\nsnap only hurt Cocky-locky, but didn’t kill him, he called out to\nHenny-penny. So she turned tail and ran back home, so she never told\nthe king the sky was a-falling.",
        "Childe Rowland and his brothers twain Were playing at the ball, And\nthere was their sister Burd Ellen In the midst, among them all.",
        "  Childe Rowland kicked it with his foot\n  And caught it with his knee;\n  At last as he plunged among them all\n  O’er the church he made it flee.",
        "  Burd Ellen round about the aisle\n  To seek the ball is gone,\n  But long they waited, and longer still,\n  And she came not back again.",
        "  They sought her east, they sought her west,\n  They sought her up and down,\n  And woe were the hearts of those brethren,\n  For she was not to be found.",
        "So at last her eldest brother went to the Warlock Merlin and told him\nall the case, and asked him if he knew where Burd Ellen was. “The fair\nBurd Ellen,” said the Warlock Merlin, “must have been carried off by\nthe fairies, because she went round the church ’wider shins’–the\nopposite way to the sun. She is now in the Dark Tower of the King of\nElfland; it would take the boldest knight in Christendom to bring her\nback.”",
        "“If it is possible to bring her back,” said her brother, “I’ll do it,\nor perish in the attempt.”",
        "“Possible it is,” said the Warlock Merlin, “but woe to the man or\nmother’s son that attempts it, if he is not well taught beforehand\nwhat he is to do.”",
        "The eldest brother of Burd Ellen was not to be put off, by any fear of\ndanger, from attempting to get her back, so he begged the Warlock\nMerlin to tell him what he should do, and what he should not do, in\ngoing to seek his sister. And after he had been taught, and had\nrepeated his lesson, he set out for Elfland.",
        "  But long they waited, and longer still,\n    With doubt and muckle pain,\n  But woe were the hearts of his brethren,\n    For he came not back again.",
        "Then the second brother got tired and sick of waiting, and he went to\nthe Warlock Merlin and asked him the same as his brother. So he set\nout to find Burd Ellen.",
        "  But long they waited, and longer still,\n    With muckle doubt and pain,\n  And woe were his mother’s and brother’s heart,\n    For he came not back again.",
        "And when they had waited and waited a good long time, Childe Rowland,\nthe youngest of Burd Ellen’s brothers, wished to go, and went to his\nmother, the good queen, to ask her to let him go. But she would not at\nfirst, for he was the last of her children she now had, and if he was\nlost, all would be lost. But he begged, and he begged, till at last\nthe good queen let him go, and gave him his father’s good brand that\nnever struck in vain. And as she girt it round his waist, she said the\nspell that would give it victory.",
        "So Childe Rowland said good-bye to the good queen, his mother, and\nwent to the cave of the Warlock Merlin. “Once more, and but once\nmore,” he said to the Warlock, “tell how man or mother’s son may\nrescue Burd Ellen and her brothers twain.”",
        "“Well, my son,” said the Warlock Merlin, “there are but two things,\nsimple they may seem, but hard they are to do. One thing to do, and\none thing not to do. And the thing to do is this: after you have\nentered the land of Fairy, whoever speaks to you, till you meet the\nBurd Ellen, you must out with your father’s brand and off with their\nhead. And what you’ve not to do is this: bite no bit, and drink no\ndrop, however hungry or thirsty you be; drink a drop, or bite a bit,\nwhile in Elfland you be and never will you see Middle Earth again.”",
        "So Childe Rowland said the two things over and over again, till he\nknew them by heart, and he thanked the Warlock Merlin and went on his\nway. And he went along, and along, and along, and still further along,\ntill he came to the horse-herd of the King of Elfland feeding his\nhorses. These he knew by their fiery eyes, and knew that he was at\nlast in the land of Fairy. “Canst thou tell me,” said Childe Rowland\nto the horse-herd, “where the King of Elfland’s Dark Tower is?” “I\ncannot tell thee,” said the horse-herd, “but go on a little further\nand thou wilt come to the cow-herd, and he, maybe, can tell thee.”",
        "Then, without a word more, Childe Rowland drew the good brand that\nnever struck in vain, and off went the horse-herd’s head, and Childe\nRowland went on further, till he came to the cow-herd, and asked him\nthe same question. “I can’t tell thee,” said he, “but go on a little\nfarther, and thou wilt come to the hen-wife, and she is sure to know.\"\nThen Childe Rowland out with his good brand, that never struck in\nvain, and off went the cow-herd’s head. And he went on a little\nfurther, till he came to an old woman in a grey cloak, and he asked\nher if she knew where the Dark Tower of the King of Elfland was. “Go\non a, little further,” said the hen-wife, “till you come to a round\ngreen hill, surrounded with terrace-rings, from the bottom to the top;\ngo round it three times, widershins, and each time say:",
        "  Open, door! open, door!\n  And let me come in.",
        "and the third time the door will open, and you may go in.” And Childe\nRowland was just going on, when he remembered what he had to do; so he\nout with the good brand, that never struck in vain, and off went the\nhen-wife’s head.",
        "Then he went on, and on, and on, till he came to the round green hill\nwith the terrace-rings from top to bottom, and he went round it three\ntimes, widershins, saying each time:",
        "  Open, door! open, door!\n  And let me come in.",
        "And the third time the door did open, and he went in, and it closed\nwith a click, and Childe Rowland was left in the dark.",
        "It was not exactly dark, but a kind of twilight or gloaming. There\nwere neither windows nor candles, and he could not make out where the\ntwilight came from, if not through the walls and roof. These were\nrough arches made of a transparent rock, incrusted with sheepsilver\nand rock spar, and other bright stones. But though it was rock, the\nair was quite warm, as it always is in Elfland. So he went through\nthis passage till at last he came to two wide and high folding-doors\nwhich stood ajar. And when he opened them, there he saw a most\nwonderful and glorious sight. A large and spacious hall, so large that\nit seemed to be as long, and as broad, as the green hill itself. The\nroof was supported by fine pillars, so large and lofty, that the\npillars of a cathedral were as nothing to them. They were all of gold\nand silver, with fretted work, and between them and around them,\nwreaths of flowers, composed of what do you think? Why, of diamonds\nand emeralds, and all manner of precious stones. And the very key-\nstones of the arches had for ornaments clusters of diamonds and\nrubies, and pearls, and other precious stones. And all these arches\nmet in the middle of the roof, and just there, hung by a gold chain,\nan immense lamp made out of one big pearl hollowed out and quite\ntransparent. And in the middle of this was a big, huge carbuncle,\nwhich kept spinning round and round, and this was what gave light by\nits rays to the whole hall, which seemed as if the setting sun was\nshining on it.",
        "The hall was furnished in a manner equally grand, and at one end of it\nwas a glorious couch of velvet, silk and gold, and there sate Burd\nEllen, combing her golden hair with a silver comb. And when she saw\nChilde Rowland she stood up and said:",
        "  “God pity ye, poor luckless fool,\n  What have ye here to do?",
        "  “Hear ye this, my youngest brother,\n  Why didn’t ye bide at home?\n  Had you a hundred thousand lives\n  Ye couldn’t spare any a one.",
        "  “But sit ye down; but woe, O, woe,\n  That ever ye were born,\n  For come the King of Elfland in,\n  Your fortune is forlorn.”",
        "Then they sate down together, and Childe Rowland told her all that he\nhad done, and she told him how their two brothers had reached the Dark\nTower, but had been enchanted by the King of Elfland, and lay there\nentombed as if dead. And then after they had talked a little longer\nChilde Rowland began to feel hungry from his long travels, and told\nhis sister Burd Ellen how hungry he was and asked for some food,\nforgetting all about the Warlock Merlin’s warning.",
        "Burd Ellen looked at Childe Rowland sadly, and shook her head, but she\nwas under a spell, and could not warn him. So she rose up, and went\nout, and soon brought back a golden basin full of bread and milk.\nChilde Rowland was just going to raise it to his lips, when he looked\nat his sister and remembered why he had come all that way. So he\ndashed the bowl to the ground, and said: “Not a sup will I swallow,\nnor a bit will I bite, till Burd Ellen is set free.”",
        "Just at that moment they heard the noise of some one approaching, and\na loud voice was heard saying:",
        "  “Fee, fi, fo, fum,\n  I smell the blood of a Christian man,\n  Be he dead, be he living, with my brand,\n  I’ll dash his brains from his brain-pan.”",
        "And then the folding-doors of the hall were burst open, and the King\nof Elfland rushed in.",
        "“Strike then, Bogle, if thou darest,” shouted out Childe Rowland, and\nrushed to meet him with his good brand that never yet did fail. They\nfought, and they fought, and they fought, till Childe Rowland beat the\nKing of Elfland down on to his knees, and caused him to yield and beg\nfor mercy. “I grant thee mercy,” said Childe Rowland, “release my\nsister from thy spells and raise my brothers to life, and let us all\ngo free, and thou shalt be spared.” “I agree,” said the Elfin King,\nand rising up he went to a chest from which he took a phial filled\nwith a blood-red liquor. With this he anointed the ears, eyelids,\nnostrils, lips, and finger-tips, of the two brothers, and they sprang\nat once into life, and declared that their souls had been away, but\nhad now returned. The Elfin king then said some words to Burd Ellen,\nand she was disenchanted, and they all four passed out of the hall,\nthrough the long passage, and turned their back on the Dark Tower,\nnever to return again. And they reached home, and the good queen,\ntheir mother, and Burd Ellen never went round a church widershins\nagain.",
        "Once upon a time there was a man and a wife had too many children, and\nthey could not get meat for them, so they took the three youngest and\nleft them in a wood. They travelled and travelled and could see never\na house. It began to be dark, and they were hungry. At last they saw a\nlight and made for it; it turned out to be a house. They knocked at\nthe door, and a woman came to it, who said: “What do you want?” They\nsaid: “Please let us in and give us something to eat.” The woman said:\n\"I can’t do that, as my man is a giant, and he would kill you if he\ncomes home.” They begged hard. “Let us stop for a little while,” said\nthey, “and we will go away before he comes.” So she took them in, and\nset them down before the fire, and gave them milk and bread; but just\nas they had begun to eat a great knock came to the door, and a\ndreadful voice said:",
        "  “Fee, fie, fo, fum,\n  I smell the blood of some earthly one.",
        "Who have you there wife?” “Eh,” said the wife, “it’s three poor\nlassies cold and hungry, and they will go away. Ye won’t touch ’em,\nman.” He said nothing, but ate up a big supper, and ordered them to\nstay all night. Now he had three lassies of his own, and they were to\nsleep in the same bed with the three strangers.",
        "The youngest of the three strange lassies was called Molly Whuppie,\nand she was very clever. She noticed that before they went to bed the\ngiant put straw ropes round her neck and her sisters’, and round his\nown lassies’ necks he put gold chains. So Molly took care and did not\nfall asleep, but waited till she was sure every one was sleeping\nsound. Then she slipped out of the bed, and took the straw ropes off\nher own and her sisters’ necks, and took the gold chains off the\ngiant’s lassies. She then put the straw ropes on the giant’s lassies\nand the gold on herself and her sisters, and lay down.",
        "And in the middle of the night up rose the giant, armed with a great\nclub, and felt for the necks with the straw. It was dark. He took his\nown lassies out of bed on to the floor, and battered them until they\nwere dead, and then lay down again, thinking he had managed fine.\nMolly thought it time she and her sisters were out of that, so she\nwakened them and told them to be quiet, and they slipped out of the\nhouse. They all got out safe, and they ran and ran, and never stopped\nuntil morning, when they saw a grand house before them. It turned out\nto be a king’s house: so Molly went in, and told her story to the\nking. He said: “Well, Molly, you are a clever girl, and you have\nmanaged well; but, if you would manage better, and go back, and steal\nthe giant’s sword that hangs on the back of his bed, I would give your\neldest sister my eldest son to marry.” Molly said she would try.",
        "So she went back, and managed to slip into the giant’s house, and\ncrept in below the bed. The giant came home, and ate up a great\nsupper, and went to bed. Molly waited until he was snoring, and she\ncrept out, and reached over the giant and got down the sword; but just\nas she got it out over the bed it gave a rattle, and up jumped the\ngiant, and Molly ran out at the door and the sword with her; and she\nran, and he ran, till they came to the “Bridge of one hair\"; and she\ngot over, but he couldn’t, and he says, “Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie!\nnever ye come again.” And she says “Twice yet, carle,” quoth she,\n\"I’ll come to Spain.” So Molly took the sword to the king, and her\nsister was married to his son.",
        "Well, the king he says: “Ye’ve managed well, Molly; but if ye would\nmanage better, and steal the purse that lies below the giant’s pillow,\nI would marry your second sister to my second son.” And Molly said she\nwould try. So she set out for the giant’s house, and slipped in, and\nhid again below the bed, and waited till the giant had eaten his\nsupper, and was snoring sound asleep. She slipped out, and slipped her\nhand below the pillow, and got out the purse; but just as she was\ngoing out the giant wakened, and ran after her; and she ran, and he\nran, till they came to the “Bridge of one hair,” and she got over, but\nhe couldn’t, and he said, “Woe worth ye, Molly Whuppie! never you come\nagain.” “Once yet, carle,” quoth she, “I’ll come to Spain.” So Molly\ntook the purse to the king, and her second sister was married to the\nking’s second son.",
        "After that the king says to Molly: “Molly, you are a clever girl, but\nif you would do better yet, and steal the giant’s ring that he wears\non his finger, I will give you my youngest son for yourself.” Molly\nsaid she would try. So back she goes to the giant’s house, and hides\nherself below the bed. The giant wasn’t long ere he came home, and,\nafter he had eaten a great big supper, he went to his bed, and shortly\nwas snoring loud. Molly crept out and reached over the bed, and got\nhold of the giant’s hand, and she pulled and she pulled until she got\noff the ring; but just as she got it off the giant got up, and gripped\nher by the hand, and he says: “Now I have catcht you, Molly Whuppie,\nand, if I had done as much ill to you as ye have done to me, what\nwould ye do to me?”",
        "Molly says: “I would put you into a sack, and I’d put the cat inside\nwith you, and the dog aside you, and a needle and thread and a shears,\nand I’d hang you up upon the wall, and I’d go to the wood, and choose\nthe thickest stick I could get, and I would come home, and take you\ndown, and bang you till you were dead.”",
        "“Well, Molly,” says the giant, “I’ll just do that to you.”",
        "So he gets a sack, and puts Molly into it, and the cat and the dog\nbeside her, and a needle and thread and shears, and hangs her up upon\nthe wall, and goes to the wood to choose a stick.",
        "Molly she sings out: “Oh, if ye saw what I see.”",
        "“Oh,” says the giant’s wife, “what do ye see, Molly?”",
        "But Molly never said a word but, “Oh, if ye saw what I see!”",
        "The giant’s wife begged that Molly would take her up into the sack\ntill she would see what Molly saw. So Molly took the shears and cut a\nhole in the sack, and took out the needle and thread with her, and\njumped down and helped, the giant’s wife up into the sack, and sewed\nup the hole.",
        "The giant’s wife saw nothing, and began to ask to get down again; but\nMolly never minded, but hid herself at the back of the door. Home came\nthe giant, and a great big tree in his hand, and he took down the\nsack, and began to batter it. His wife cried, “It’s me, man;” but the\ndog barked and the cat mewed, and he did not know his wife’s voice.\nBut Molly came out from the back of the door, and the giant saw her,\nand he after her; and he ran and she ran, till they came to the\n\"Bridge of one hair,” and she got over but he couldn’t; and he said,\n\"Woe worth you, Molly Whuppie! never you come again.” “Never more,\ncarle,” quoth she, “will I come again to Spain.”",
        "So Molly took the ring to the king, and she was married to his\nyoungest son, and she never saw the giant again.",
        "There was once a widow that lived on a small bit of ground, which she\nrented from a farmer. And she had two sons; and by-and-by it was time\nfor the wife to send them away to seek their fortune. So she told her\neldest son one day to take a can and bring her water from the well,\nthat she might bake a cake for him; and however much or however little\nwater he might bring, the cake would be great or small accordingly,\nand that cake was to be all that she could give him when he went on\nhis travels.",
        "The lad went away with the can to the well, and filled it with water,\nand then came away home again; but the can being broken, the most part\nof the water had run out before he got back. So his cake was very\nsmall; yet small as it was, his mother asked him if he was willing to\ntake the half of it with her blessing, telling him that, if he chose\nrather to take the whole, he would only get it with her curse. The\nyoung man, thinking he might have to travel a far way, and not knowing\nwhen or how he might get other provisions, said he would like to have\nthe whole cake, come of his mother’s malison what like; so she gave\nhim the whole cake, and her malison along with it. Then he took his\nbrother aside, and gave him a knife to keep till he should come back,\ndesiring him to look at it every morning, and as long as it continued\nto be clear, then he might be sure that the owner of it was well; but\nif it grew dim and rusty, then for certain some ill had befallen him.",
        "So the young man went to seek his fortune. And he went all that day,\nand all the next day; and on the third day, in the afternoon, he came\nup to where a shepherd was sitting with a flock of sheep. And he went\nup to the shepherd and asked him who the sheep belonged to; and he\nanswered:",
        "  “The Red Ettin of Ireland\n    Once lived in Ballygan,\n  And stole King Malcolm’s daughter\n    The king of fair Scotland.",
        "  He beats her, he binds her,\n    He lays her on a band;\n  And every day he strikes her\n    With a bright silver wand.\n  Like Julian the Roman,\n  He’s one that fears no man.",
        "  It’s said there’s one predestinate\n    To be his mortal foe;\n  But that man is yet unborn,\n    And long may it be so.”",
        "This shepherd also told him to beware of the beasts he should next\nmeet, for they were of a very different kind from any he had yet seen.",
        "So the young man went on, and by-and-by he saw a multitude of very\ndreadful beasts, with two heads, and on every head four horns. And he\nwas sore frightened, and ran away from them as fast as he could; and\nglad was he when he came to a castle that stood on a hillock, with the\ndoor standing wide open to the wall. And he went into the castle for\nshelter, and there he saw an old wife sitting beside the kitchen fire.\nHe asked the wife if he might stay for the night, as he was tired with\na long journey; and the wife said he might, but it was not a good\nplace for him to be in, as it belonged to the Red Ettin, who was a\nvery terrible beast, with three heads, that spared no living man it\ncould get hold of. The young man would have gone away, but he was\nafraid of the beasts on the outside of the castle; so he beseeched the\nold woman to hide him as best she could, and not tell the Ettin he was\nthere. He thought, if he could put over the night, he might get away\nin the morning, without meeting with the beasts, and so escape. But he\nhad not been long in his hiding-hole, before the awful Ettin came in;\nand no sooner was he in, than he was heard crying:",
        "  “Snouk but and snouk ben,\n  I find the smell of an earthly man,\n  Be he living, or be he dead,\n  His heart this night shall kitchen my bread.”",
        "The monster soon found the poor young man, and pulled him from his\nhole. And when he had got him out, he told him that if he could answer\nhim three questions his life should be spared. So the first head\nasked: “A thing without an end, what’s that?” But the young man knew\nnot. Then the second head said: “The smaller, the more dangerous,\nwhat’s that?” But the young man knew it not. And then the third head\nasked: “The dead carrying the living; riddle me that?” But the young\nman had to give it up. The lad not being able to answer one of these\nquestions, the Red Ettin took a mallet and knocked him on the head,\nand turned him into a pillar of stone.",
        "On the morning after this happened, the younger brother took out the\nknife to look at it, and he was grieved to find it all brown with\nrust. He told his mother that the time was now come for him to go away\nupon his travels also; so she requested him to take the can to the\nwell for water, that she might make a cake for him. And he went, and\nas he was bringing home the water, a raven over his head cried to him\nto look, and he would see that the water was running out. And he was a\nyoung man of sense, and seeing the water running out, he took some\nclay and patched up the holes, so that he brought home enough water to\nbake a large cake. When his mother put it to him to take the half cake\nwith her blessing, he took it in preference to having the whole with\nher malison; and yet the half was bigger than what the other lad had\ngot.",
        "So he went away on his journey; and after he had travelled a far way,\nhe met with an old woman that asked him if be would give her a bit of\nhis johnny-cake. And he said: “I will gladly do that,” and so he gave\nher a piece of the johnny-cake; and for that she gave him a magical\nwand, that she might yet be of service to him, if he took care to use\nit rightly. Then the old woman, who was a fairy, told him a great deal\nthat would happen to him, and what he ought to do in all\ncircumstances; and after that she vanished in an instant out of his\nsight. He went on a great way farther, and then he came up to the old\nman herding the sheep; and when he asked whose sheep these were, the\nanswer was:",
        "  “The Red Ettin of Ireland\n    Once lived in Ballygan,\n  And stole King Malcolm’s daughter,\n    The king of Fair Scotland.",
        "  “He beats her, he binds her,\n    He lays her on a band;\n  And every day he strikes her\n    With a bright silver wand.\n  Like Julian the Roman,\n  He’s one that fears no man.",
        "  “But now I fear his end is near,\n    And destiny at hand;\n  And you’re to be, I plainly see,\n    The heir of all his land.”",
        "When he came to the place where the monstrous beasts were standing, he\ndid not stop nor run away, but went boldly through amongst them. One\ncame up roaring with open mouth to devour him, when he struck it with\nhis wand, and laid it in an instant dead at his feet. He soon came to\nthe Ettin’s castle, where he knocked, and was admitted. The old woman\nwho sat by the fire warned him of the terrible Ettin, and what had\nbeen the fate of his brother; but he was not to be daunted. The\nmonster soon came in, saying:",
        "  “Snouk but and snouk ben,\n  I find the smell of an earthly man;\n  Be he living, or be he dead,\n  His heart shall be kitchen to my bread.”",
        "He quickly espied the young man, and bade him come forth on the floor.\nAnd then he put the three questions to him; but the young man had been\ntold everything by the good fairy, so he was able to answer all the\nquestions. So when the first head asked, “What’s the thing without an\nend?” he said: “A bowl.” And when the second head said: “The smaller\nthe more dangerous; what’s that?” he said at once, “A bridge.” And\nlast, the third head said: “When does the dead carry the living,\nriddle me that?” Then the young man answered up at once and said:\n\"When a ship sails on the sea with men inside her.” When the Ettin\nfound this, he knew that his power was gone. The young man then took\nup an axe and hewed off the monster’s three heads. He next asked the\nold woman to show him where the king’s daughter lay; and the old woman\ntook him upstairs, and opened a great many doors, and out of every\ndoor came a beautiful lady who had been imprisoned there by the Ettin;\nand one of the ladies was the king’s daughter. She also took him down\ninto a low room, and there stood a stone pillar, that he had only to\ntouch with his wand, when his brother started into life. And the whole\nof the prisoners were overjoyed at their deliverance, for which they\nthanked the young man. Next day they all set out for the king’s court,\nand a gallant company they made. And the king married his daughter to\nthe young man that had delivered her, and gave a noble’s daughter to\nhis brother; and so they all lived happily all the rest of their days.",
        "Here was once a man who travelled the land all over in search of a\nwife. He saw young and old, rich and poor, pretty and plain, and could\nnot meet with one to his mind. At last he found a woman, young, fair,\nand rich, who possessed a right arm of solid gold. He married her at\nonce, and thought no man so fortunate as he was. They lived happily\ntogether, but, though he wished people to think otherwise, he was\nfonder of the golden arm than of all his wife’s gifts besides.",
        "At last she died. The husband put on the blackest black, and pulled\nthe longest face at the funeral; but for all that he got up in the\nmiddle of the night, dug up the body, and cut off the golden arm. He\nhurried home to hide his treasure, and thought no one would know.",
        "The following night he put the golden arm under his pillow, and was\njust falling asleep, when the ghost of his dead wife glided into the\nroom. Stalking up to the bedside it drew the curtain, and looked at\nhim reproachfully. Pretending not to be afraid, he spoke to the ghost,\nand said: “What hast thou done with thy cheeks so red?”",
        "“All withered and wasted away,” replied the ghost, in a hollow tone.",
        "“What hast thou done with thy red rosy lips?”",
        "“All withered and wasted away.”",
        "“What hast thou done with thy golden hair?”",
        "“All withered and wasted away.”",
        "“What hast thou done with thy Golden Arm?”",
        "“Thou Hast It!”",
        "In the days of the great Prince Arthur, there lived a mighty magician,\ncalled Merlin, the most learned and skilful enchanter the world has\never seen.",
        "This famous magician, who could take any form he pleased, was\ntravelling about as a poor beggar, and being very tired, he stopped at\nthe cottage of a ploughman to rest himself, and asked for some food.",
        "The countryman bade him welcome, and his wife, who was a very good-\nhearted woman, soon brought him some milk in a wooden bowl, and some\ncoarse brown bread on a platter.",
        "Merlin was much pleased with the kindness of the ploughman and his\nwife; but he could not help noticing that though everything was neat\nand comfortable in the cottage, they seemed both to be very unhappy.\nHe therefore asked them why they were so melancholy, and learned that\nthey were miserable because they had no children.",
        "The poor woman said, with tears in her eyes: “I should be the happiest\ncreature in the world if I had a son; although he was no bigger than\nmy husband’s thumb, I would be satisfied.”",
        "Merlin was so much amused with the idea of a boy no bigger than a\nman’s thumb, that he determined to grant the poor woman’s wish.\nAccordingly, in a short time after, the ploughman’s wife had a son,\nwho, wonderful to relate! was not a bit bigger than his father’s\nthumb.",
        "The queen of the fairies, wishing to see the little fellow, came in at\nthe window while the mother was sitting up in the bed admiring him.\nThe queen kissed the child, and, giving it the name of Tom Thumb, sent\nfor some of the fairies, who dressed her little godson according to\nher orders:",
        "  “An oak-leaf hat he had for his crown;\n  His shirt of web by spiders spun;\n  With jacket wove of thistle’s down;\n  His trowsers were of feathers done.\n  His stockings, of apple-rind, they tie\n  With eyelash from his mother’s eye\n  His shoes were made of mouse’s skin,\n  Tann’d with the downy hair within.”",
        "Tom never grew any larger than his father’s thumb, which was only of\nordinary size; but as he got older he became very cunning and full of\ntricks. When he was old enough to play with the boys, and had lost all\nhis own cherry-stones, he used to creep into the bags of his\nplayfellows, fill his pockets, and, getting out without their noticing\nhim, would again join in the game.",
        "One day, however, as he was coming out of a bag of cherry-stones,\nwhere he had been stealing as usual, the boy to whom it belonged\nchanced to see him. “Ah, ah! my little Tommy,” said the boy, “so I\nhave caught you stealing my cherry-stones at last, and you shall be\nrewarded for your thievish tricks.” On saying this, he drew the string\ntight round his neck, and gave the bag such a hearty shake, that poor\nlittle Tom’s legs, thighs, and body were sadly bruised. He roared out\nwith pain, and begged to be let out, promising never to steal again.",
        "A short time afterwards his mother was making a batter-pudding, and\nTom, being very anxious to see how it was made, climbed up to the edge\nof the bowl; but his foot slipped, and he plumped over head and ears\ninto the batter, without his mother noticing him, who stirred him into\nthe pudding-bag, and put him in the pot to boil.",
        "The batter filled Tom’s mouth, and prevented him from crying; but, on\nfeeling the hot water, he kicked and struggled so much in the pot,\nthat his mother thought that the pudding was bewitched, and, pulling\nit out of the pot, she threw it outside the door. A poor tinker, who\nwas passing by, lifted up the pudding, and, putting it into his\nbudget, he then walked off. As Tom had now got his mouth cleared of\nthe batter, he then began to cry aloud, which so frightened the tinker\nthat he flung down the pudding and ran away. The pudding being broke\nto pieces by the fall, Tom crept out covered all over with the batter,\nand walked home. His mother, who was very sorry to see her darling in\nsuch a woeful state, put him into a teacup, and soon washed off the\nbatter; after which she kissed him, and laid him in bed.",
        "Soon after the adventure of the pudding, Tom’s mother went to milk her\ncow in the meadow, and she took him along with her. As the wind was\nvery high, for fear of being blown away, she tied him to a thistle\nwith a piece of fine thread. The cow soon observed Tom’s oak-leaf hat,\nand liking the appearance of it, took poor Tom and the thistle at one\nmouthful. While the cow was chewing the thistle Tom was afraid of her\ngreat teeth, which threatened to crush him in pieces, and he roared\nout as loud as he could: “Mother, mother!”",
        "“Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?” said his mother.",
        "“Here, mother,” replied he, “in the red cow’s mouth.”",
        "His mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised at\nthe odd noise in her throat, opened her mouth and let Tom drop out.\nFortunately his mother caught him in her apron as he was falling to\nthe ground, or he would have been dreadfully hurt. She then put Tom in\nher bosom and ran home with him.",
        "Tom’s father made him a whip of a barley straw to drive the cattle\nwith, and having one day gone into the fields, he slipped a foot and\nrolled into the furrow. A raven, which was flying over, picked him up,\nand flew with him over the sea, and there dropped him.",
        "A large fish swallowed Tom the moment he fell into the sea, which was\nsoon after caught, and bought for the table of King Arthur. When they\nopened the fish in order to cook it, every one was astonished at\nfinding such a little boy, and Tom was quite delighted at being free\nagain. They carried him to the king, who made Tom his dwarf, and he\nsoon grew a great favourite at court; for by his tricks and gambols he\nnot only amused the king and queen, but also all the Knights of the\nRound Table.",
        "It is said that when the king rode out on horseback, he often took Tom\nalong with him, and if a shower came on, he used to creep into his\nmajesty’s waistcoat-pocket, where he slept till the rain was over.",
        "King Arthur one day asked Tom about his parents, wishing to know if\nthey were as small as he was, and whether they were well off. Tom told\nthe king that his father and mother were as tall as anybody about the\ncourt, but in rather poor circumstances. On hearing this, the king\ncarried Tom to his treasury, the place where he kept all his money,\nand told him to take as much money as he could carry home to his\nparents, which made the poor little fellow caper with joy. Tom went\nimmediately to procure a purse, which was made of a water-bubble, and\nthen returned to the treasury, where be received a silver threepenny-\npiece to put into it.",
        "Our little hero had some difficulty in lifting the burden upon his\nback; but he at last succeeded in getting it placed to his mind, and\nset forward on his journey. However, without meeting with any\naccident, and after resting himself more than a hundred times by the\nway, in two days and two nights he reached his father’s house in\nsafety.",
        "Tom had travelled forty-eight hours with a huge silver-piece on his\nback, and was almost tired to death, when his mother ran out to meet\nhim, and carried him into the house. But he soon returned to Court.",
        "As Tom’s clothes had suffered much in the batter-pudding, and the\ninside of the fish, his majesty ordered him a new suit of clothes, and\nto be mounted as a knight on a mouse.",
        "  Of Butterfly’s wings his shirt was made,\n    His boots of chicken’s hide;\n  And by a nimble fairy blade,\n  Well learned in the tailoring trade,\n    His clothing was supplied.\n  A needle dangled by his side;\n  A dapper mouse he used to ride,\n  Thus strutted Tom in stately pride!",
        "It was certainly very diverting to see Tom in this dress and mounted\non the mouse, as he rode out a-hunting with the king and nobility, who\nwere all ready to expire with laughter at Tom and his fine prancing\ncharger.",
        "The king was so charmed with his address that he ordered a little\nchair to be made, in order that Tom might sit upon his table, and also\na palace of gold, a span high, with a door an inch wide, to live in.\nHe also gave him a coach, drawn by six small mice.",

        "The king sent for Tom in great haste, but being fully aware of the\ndanger of royal anger, he crept into an empty snail-shell, where he\nlay for a long time until he was almost starved with hunger; but at\nlast he ventured to peep out, and seeing a fine large butterfly on the\nground, near the place of his concealment, he got close to it and\njumping astride on it, was carried up into the air. The butterfly flew\nwith him from tree to tree and from field to field, and at last\nreturned to the court, where the king and nobility all strove to catch\nhim; but at last poor Tom fell from his seat into a watering-pot, in\nwhich he was almost drowned.",
        "When the queen saw him she was in a rage, and said he should be\nbeheaded; and he was again put into a mouse trap until the time of his\nexecution.",
        "However a cat, observing something alive in the trap, patted it about\ntill the wires broke, and set Thomas at liberty.",
        "The king received Tom again into favour, which he did not live to\nenjoy, for a large spider one day attacked him; and although he drew\nhis sword and fought well, yet the spider’s poisonous breath at last\novercame him.",
        "  He fell dead on the ground where he stood,\n  And the spider suck’d every drop of his blood.",

Tom Thumb is dead!",
        "Lady Mary was young, and Lady Mary was fair. She had two brothers, and\nmore lovers than she could count. But of them all, the bravest and\nmost gallant, was a Mr. Fox, whom she met when she was down at her\nfather’s country-house. No one knew who Mr. Fox was; but he was\ncertainly brave, and surely rich, and of all her lovers, Lady Mary\ncared for him alone. At last it was agreed upon between them that they\nshould be married. Lady Mary asked Mr. Fox where they should live, and\nhe described to her his castle, and where it was; but, strange to say,\ndid not ask her, or her brothers to come and see it.",
        "So one day, near the wedding-day, when her brothers were out, and Mr.\nFox was away for a day or two on business, as he said, Lady Mary set\nout for Mr. Fox’s castle. And after many searchings, she came at last\nto it, and a fine strong house it was, with high walls and a deep\nmoat. And when she came up to the gateway she saw written on it:",
        "Be Bold, Be Bold.",
        "But as the gate was open, she went through it, and found no one there.\nSo she went up to the doorway, and over it she found written:",
        "Be Bold, Be Bold, But Not Too Bold.",
        "Still she went on, till she came into the hall, and went up the broad\nstairs till she came to a door in the gallery, over which was written:",
        "Be Bold, Be Bold, But Not Too Bold, Lest That Your Heart’s Blood\nShould Run Cold.",
        "But Lady Mary was a brave one, she was, and she opened the door, and\nwhat do you think she saw? Why, bodies and skeletons of beautiful\nyoung ladies all stained with blood. So Lady Mary thought it was high\ntime to get out of that horrid place, and she closed the door, went\nthrough the gallery, and was just going down the stairs, and out of\nthe hall, when who should she see through the window, but Mr. Fox\ndragging a beautiful young lady along from the gateway to the door.\nLady Mary rushed downstairs, and hid herself behind a cask, just in\ntime, as Mr. Fox came in with the poor young lady who seemed to have\nfainted. Just as he got near Lady Mary, Mr. Fox saw a diamond ring\nglittering on the finger of the young lady he was dragging, and he\ntried to pull it off. But it was tightly fixed, and would not come\noff, so Mr. Fox cursed and swore, and drew his sword, raised it, and\nbrought it down upon the hand of the poor lady. The sword cut off the\nhand, which jumped up into the air, and fell of all places in the\nworld into Lady Mary’s lap. Mr. Fox looked about a bit, but did not\nthink of looking behind the cask, so at last he went on dragging the\nyoung lady up the stairs into the Bloody Chamber.",
        "As soon as she heard him pass through the gallery, Lady Mary crept out\nof the door, down through the gateway, and ran home as fast as she\ncould.",
        "Now it happened that the very next day the marriage contract of Lady\nMary and Mr. Fox was to be signed, and there was a splendid breakfast\nbefore that. And when Mr. Fox was seated at table opposite Lady Mary,\nhe looked at her. “How pale you are this morning, my dear.” “Yes,\"\nsaid she, “I had a bad night’s rest last night. I had horrible\ndreams.” “Dreams go by contraries,” said Mr. Fox; “but tell us your\ndream, and your sweet voice will make the time pass till the happy\nhour comes.”",
        "“I dreamed,” said Lady Mary, “that I went yestermorn to your castle,\nand I found it in the woods, with high walls, and a deep moat, and\nover the gateway was written:",
        "Be Bold, Be Bold.",
        "“But it is not so, nor it was not so,” said Mr. Fox.",
        "“And when I came to the doorway over it was written:",
        "Be Bold, Be Bold, But Not Too Bold.",
        "“It is not so, nor it was not so,” said Mr. Fox.",
        "“And then I went upstairs, and came to a gallery, at the end of which\nwas a door, on which was written:",

        "“It is not so, nor it was not so,” said Mr. Fox.",

        "“It is not so, nor it was not so. And God forbid it should be so,\"\nsaid Mr. Fox.",
        "“I then dreamed that I rushed down the gallery, and just as I was\ngoing down the stairs, I saw you, Mr. Fox, coming up to the hall door,\ndragging after you a poor young lady, rich and beautiful.”",
        "“It is not so, nor it was not so. And God forbid it should be so,\"\nsaid Mr. Fox.",
        "“I rushed downstairs, just in time to hide myself behind a cask, when\nyou, Mr. Fox, came in dragging the young lady by the arm. And, as you\npassed me, Mr. Fox, I thought I saw you try and get off her diamond\nring, and when you could not, Mr. Fox, it seemed to me in my dream,\nthat you out with your sword and hacked off the poor lady’s hand to\nget the ring.”",
        "“It is not so, nor it was not so. And God forbid it should be so,\"\nsaid Mr. Fox, and was going to say something else as he rose from his\nseat, when Lady Mary cried out:",
        "“But it is so, and it was so. Here’s hand and ring I have to show,\"\nand pulled out the lady’s hand from her dress, and pointed it straight\nat Mr. Fox.",
        "At once her brothers and her friends drew their swords and cut Mr. Fox\ninto a thousand pieces.",
        "Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was Jack, and he lived\nwith his mother on a common. They were very poor, and the old woman\ngot her living by spinning, but Jack was so lazy that he would do\nnothing but bask in the sun in the hot weather, and sit by the corner\nof the hearth in the winter-time. So they called him Lazy Jack. His\nmother could not get him to do anything for her, and at last told him,\none Monday, that if he did not begin to work for his porridge she\nwould turn him out to get his living as he could.",
        "This roused Jack, and he went out and hired himself for the next day\nto a neighbouring farmer for a penny; but as he was coming home, never\nhaving had any money before, he lost it in passing over a brook. “You\nstupid boy,” said his mother, “you should have put it in your pocket.\"\n\"I’ll do so another time,” replied Jack.",
        "On Wednesday, Jack went out again and hired himself to a cow-keeper,\nwho gave him a jar of milk for his day’s work. Jack took the jar and\nput it into the large pocket of his jacket, spilling it all, long\nbefore he got home. “Dear me!” said the old woman; “you should have\ncarried it on your head.” “I’ll do so another time,” said Jack.",
        "So on Thursday, Jack hired himself again to a farmer, who agreed to\ngive him a cream cheese for his services. In the evening Jack took the\ncheese, and went home with it on his head. By the time he got home the\ncheese was all spoilt, part of it being lost, and part matted with his\nhair. “You stupid lout,” said his mother, “you should have carried it\nvery carefully in your hands.” “I’ll do so another time,” replied\nJack.",
        "On Friday, Lazy Jack again went out, and hired himself to a baker, who\nwould give him nothing for his work but a large tom-cat. Jack took the\ncat, and began carrying it very carefully in his hands, but in a short\ntime pussy scratched him so much that he was compelled to let it go.\nWhen he got home, his mother said to him, “You silly fellow, you\nshould have tied it with a string, and dragged it along after you.\"\n\"I’ll do so another time,” said Jack.",
        "So on Saturday, Jack hired himself to a butcher, who rewarded him by\nthe handsome present of a shoulder of mutton. Jack took the mutton,\ntied it to a string, and trailed it along after him in the dirt, so\nthat by the time he had got home the meat was completely spoilt. His\nmother was this time quite out of patience with him, for the next day\nwas Sunday, and she was obliged to make do with cabbage for her\ndinner. “You ninney-hammer,” said she to her son; “you should have\ncarried it on your shoulder.” “I’ll do so another time,” replied Jack.",
        "On the next Monday, Lazy Jack went once more, and hired himself to a\ncattle-keeper, who gave him a donkey for his trouble. Jack found it\nhard to hoist the donkey on his shoulders, but at last he did it, and\nbegan walking slowly home with his prize. Now it happened that in the\ncourse of his journey there lived a rich man with his only daughter, a\nbeautiful girl, but deaf and dumb. Now she had never laughed in her\nlife, and the doctors said she would never speak till somebody made\nher laugh. This young lady happened to be looking out of the window\nwhen Jack was passing with the donkey on his shoulders, with the legs\nsticking up in the air, and the sight was so comical and strange that\nshe burst out into a great fit of laughter, and immediately recovered\nher speech and hearing. Her father was overjoyed, and fulfilled his\npromise by marrying her to Lazy Jack, who was thus made a rich\ngentleman. They lived in a large house, and Jack’s mother lived with\nthem in great happiness until she died.",
        "Once upon a time there was an old man, and an old woman, and a little\nboy. One morning the old woman made a Johnny-cake, and put it in the\noven to bake. “You watch the Johnny-cake while your father and I go\nout to work in the garden.” So the old man and the old woman went out\nand began to hoe potatoes, and left the little boy to tend the oven.\nBut he didn’t watch it all the time, and all of a sudden he heard a\nnoise, and he looked up and the oven door popped open, and out of the\noven jumped Johnny-cake, and went rolling along end over end, towards\nthe open door of the house. The little boy ran to shut the door, but\nJohnny-cake was too quick for him and rolled through the door, down\nthe steps, and out into the road long before the little boy could\ncatch him. The little boy ran after him as fast as he could clip it,\ncrying out to his father and mother, who heard the uproar, and threw\ndown their hoes and gave chase too. But Johnny-cake outran all three a\nlong way, and was soon out of sight, while they had to sit down, all\nout of breath, on a bank to rest.",
        "On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to two well-diggers who\nlooked up from their work and called out: “Where ye going, Johnny-\ncake?”",
        "He said: “I’ve outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy,\nand I can outrun you too-o-o!”",
        "“Ye can, can ye? we’ll see about that?” said they; and they threw down\ntheir picks and ran after him, but couldn’t catch up with him, and\nsoon they had to sit down by the roadside to rest.",
        "On ran Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to two ditch-diggers who\nwere digging a ditch. “Where ye going, Johnny-cake?” said they. He\nsaid: “I’ve outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy, and\ntwo well-diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!”",
        "“Ye can, can ye? we’ll see about that!” said they; and they threw down\ntheir spades, and ran after him too. But Johnny-cake soon outstripped\nthem also, and seeing they could never catch him, they gave up the\nchase and sat down to rest.",
        "On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a bear. The bear said:\n\"Where are ye going, Johnny-cake?”",
        "He said: “I’ve outrun an old man, and an old woman and a little boy,\nand two well-diggers, and two ditch-diggers, and I can outrun you too-\no-o!”",
        "“Ye can, can ye?” growled the bear, “we’ll see about that!” and\ntrotted as fast as his legs could carry him after Johnny-cake, who\nnever stopped to look behind him. Before long the bear was left so far\nbehind that he saw he might as well give up the hunt first as last, so\nhe stretched himself out by the roadside to rest.",
        "On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a wolf. The wolf said:–\n\"Where ye going, Johnny-cake?” He said: “I’ve outrun an old man, and\nan old woman, and a little boy, and two well-diggers, and two ditch-\ndiggers and a bear, and I can outrun you too-o-o!”",
        "“Ye can, can ye?” snarled the wolf, “we’ll see about that!” And he set\ninto a gallop after Johnny-cake, who went on and on so fast that the\nwolf too saw there was no hope of overtaking him, and he too lay down\nto rest.",
        "On went Johnny-cake, and by-and-by he came to a fox that lay quietly\nin a corner of the fence. The fox called out in a sharp voice, but\nwithout getting up: “Where ye going Johnny-cake?”",
        "He said: “I’ve outrun an old man, and an old woman, and a little boy,\nand two well-diggers, and two ditch-diggers, a bear, and a wolf, and I\ncan outrun you too-o-o!”",
        "The fox said: “I can’t quite hear you, Johnny-cake, won’t you come a\nlittle closer?” turning his head a little to one side.",
        "Johnny-cake stopped his race for the first time, and went a little\ncloser, and called out in a very loud voice “I’ve outrun an old\nman, and an old woman, and a little boy, and two well-diggers, and two\nditch-diggers, and a bear, and a wolf, and I can outrun you too-o-\no.”",
        "“Can’t quite hear you; won’t you come a little closer?” said\nthe fox in a feeble voice, as he stretched out his neck towards\nJohnny-cake, and put one paw behind his ear.",
        "Johnny-cake came up close, and leaning towards the fox screamed out:\nI’VE OUTRUN AN OLD MAN, AND AN OLD WOMAN, AND A LITTLE BOY, AND TWO\nWELL-DIGGERS, AND TWO DITCH-DIGGERS, AND A BEAR, AND A WOLF, AND I CAN\nOUTRUN YOU TOO-O-O!”",

        "One fine summer’s day Earl Mar’s daughter went into the castle garden,\ndancing and tripping along. And as she played and sported she would\nstop from time to time to listen to the music of the birds. After a\nwhile as she sat under the shade of a green oak tree she looked up and\nspied a sprightly dove sitting high up on one of its branches. She\nlooked up and said: “Coo-my-dove, my dear, come down to me and I will\ngive you a golden cage. I’ll take you home and pet you well, as well\nas any bird of them all.” Scarcely had she said these words when the\ndove flew down from the branch and settled on her shoulder, nestling\nup against her neck while she smoothed its feathers. Then she took it\nhome to her own room.",
        "The day was done and the night came on and Earl Mar’s daughter was\nthinking of going to sleep when, turning round, she found at her side\na handsome young man. She was startled, for the door had been\nlocked for hours. But she was a brave girl and said: “What are you\ndoing here, young man, to come and startle me so? The door was barred\nthese hours ago; how ever did you come here?”",
        "“Hush! hush!” the young man whispered. “I was that cooing dove that\nyou coaxed from off the tree.”",
        "“But who are you then?” she said quite low; “and how came you to be\nchanged into that dear little bird?”",
        "“My name is Florentine, and my mother is a queen, and something more\nthan a queen, for she knows magic and spells, and because I would not\ndo as she wished she turned me into a dove by day, but at night her\nspells lose their power and I become a man again. To-day I crossed the\nsea and saw you for the first time and I was glad to be a bird that I\ncould come near you. Unless you love me, I shall never be happy more.”",
        "“But if I love you,” says she, “will you not fly away and leave me one\nof these fine days?”",
        "“Never, never,” said the prince; “be my wife and I’ll be yours for\never. By day a bird, by night a prince, I will always be by your side\nas a husband, dear.”",
        "So they were married in secret and lived happily in the castle and no\none knew that every night Coo-my-dove became Prince Florentine. And\nevery year a little son came to them as bonny as bonny could be. But\nas each son was born Prince Florentine carried the little thing away\non his back over the sea to where the queen his mother lived and left\nthe little one with her.",
        "Seven years passed thus and then a great trouble came to them. For the\nEarl Mar wished to marry his daughter to a noble of high degree who\ncame wooing her. Her father pressed her sore but she said: “Father\ndear, I do not wish to marry; I can be quite happy with Coo-my-dove\nhere.”",
        "Then her father got into a mighty rage and swore a great big oath, and\nsaid: “To-morrow, so sure as I live and eat, I’ll twist that birdie’s\nneck,” and out he stamped from her room.",
        "“Oh, oh!” said Coo-my-dove; “it’s time that I was away,” and so he\njumped upon the window-sill and in a moment was flying away. And he\nflew and he flew till he was over the deep, deep sea, and yet on he\nflew till he came to his mother’s castle. Now the queen his mother was\ntaking her walk abroad when she saw the pretty dove flying overhead\nand alighting on the castle walls.",
        "“Here, dancers come and dance your jigs,” she called, “and pipers,\npipe you well, for here’s my own Florentine, come back to me to stay\nfor he’s brought no bonny boy with him this time.”",
        "“No, mother,” said Florentine, “no dancers for me and no minstrels,\nfor my dear wife, the mother of my seven, boys, is to be wed to-\nmorrow, and sad’s the day for me.”",
        "“What can I do, my son?” said the queen, “tell me, and it shall be\ndone if my magic has power to do it.”",
        "“Well then, mother dear, turn the twenty-four dancers and pipers into\ntwenty-four grey herons, and let my seven sons become seven white\nswans, and let me be a goshawk and their leader.”",
        "“Alas! alas! my son,” she said, “that may not be; my magic reaches not\nso far. But perhaps my teacher, the spaewife of Ostree, may know\nbetter.” And away she hurries to the cave of Ostree, and after a while\ncomes out as white as white can be and muttering over some burning\nherbs she brought out of the cave. Suddenly Coo-my-dove changed into a\ngoshawk and around him flew twenty-four grey herons and above them\nflew seven cygnets.",
        "Without a word or a good-bye off they flew over the deep blue sea\nwhich was tossing and moaning. They flew and they flew till they\nswooped down on Earl Mar’s castle just as the wedding party were\nsetting out for the church. First came the men-at-arms and then the\nbridegroom’s friends, and then Earl Mar’s men, and then the\nbridegroom, and lastly, pale and beautiful, Earl Mar’s daughter\nherself. They moved down slowly to stately music till they came past\nthe trees on which the birds were settling. A word from Prince\nFlorentine, the goshawk, and they all rose into the air, herons\nbeneath, cygnets above, and goshawk circling above all. The weddineers\nwondered at the sight when, swoop! the herons were down among them\nscattering the men-at-arms. The swanlets took charge of the bride\nwhile the goshawk dashed down and tied the bridegroom to a tree. Then\nthe herons gathered themselves together into one feather bed and the\ncygnets placed their mother upon them, and suddenly they all rose in\nthe air bearing the bride away with them in safety towards Prince\nFlorentine’s home. Surely a wedding party was never so disturbed in\nthis world. What could the weddineers do? They saw their pretty bride\ncarried away and away till she and the herons and the swans and the\ngoshawk disappeared, and that very day Prince Florentine brought Earl\nMar’s daughter to the castle of the queen his mother, who took the\nspell off him and they lived happy ever afterwards.",
        "Tommy Grimes was sometimes a good boy, and sometimes a bad boy; and\nwhen he was a bad boy, he was a very bad boy. Now his mother used to\nsay to him: “Tommy, Tommy, be a good boy, and don’t go out of the\nstreet, or else Mr. Miacca will take you.” But still when he was a bad\nboy he would go out of the street; and one day, sure enough, he had\nscarcely got round the corner, when Mr. Miacca did catch him and\npopped him into a bag upside down, and took him off to his house.",
        "When Mr. Miacca got Tommy inside, he pulled him out of the bag and set\nhim down, and felt his arms and legs. “You’re rather tough,” says he;\n\"but you’re all I’ve got for supper, and you’ll not taste bad boiled.\nBut body o’ me, I’ve forgot the herbs, and it’s bitter you’ll taste\nwithout herbs. Sally! Here, I say, Sally!” and he called Mrs. Miacca.",
        "So Mrs. Miacca came out of another room and said: “What d’ye want, my\ndear?”",
        "“Oh, here’s a little boy for supper,” said Mr. Miacca, “and I’ve\nforgot the herbs. Mind him, will ye, while I go for them.”",
        "“All right, my love,” says Mrs. Miacca, and off he goes.",
        "Then Tommy Grimes said to Mrs. Miacca: “Does Mr. Miacca always have\nlittle boys for supper?”",
        "“Mostly, my dear,” said Mrs. Miacca, “if little boys are bad enough,\nand get in his way.”",
        "“And don’t you have anything else but boy-meat? No pudding?” asked\nTommy.",
        "“Ah, I loves pudding,” says Mrs. Miacca. “But it’s not often the likes\nof me gets pudding.”",
        "“Why, my mother is making a pudding this very day,” said Tommy\nGrimes, “and I am sure she’d give you some, if I ask her. Shall I run\nand get some?”",
        "“Now, that’s a thoughtful boy,” said Mrs. Miacca, “only don’t be long\nand be sure to be back for supper.”",
        "So off Tommy pelters, and right glad he was to get off so cheap; and\nfor many a long day he was as good as good could be, and never went\nround the corner of the street. But he couldn’t always be good; and\none day he went round the corner, and as luck would have it, he hadn’t\nscarcely got round it when Mr. Miacca grabbed him up, popped him in\nhis bag, and took him home.",
        "When he got him there, Mr. Miacca dropped him out; and when he saw\nhim, he said: “Ah, you’re the youngster what served me and my missus\nthat shabby trick, leaving us without any supper. Well, you shan’t do\nit again. I’ll watch over you myself. Here, get under the sofa, and\nI’ll set on it and watch the pot boil for you.”",
        "So poor Tommy Grimes had to creep under the sofa, and Mr. Miacca sat\non it and waited for the pot to boil. And they waited, and they\nwaited, but still the pot didn’t boil, till at last Mr. Miacca got\ntired of waiting, and he said: “Here, you under there, I’m not going\nto wait any longer; put out your leg, and I’ll stop your giving us the\nslip.”",
        "So Tommy put out a leg, and Mr. Miacca got a chopper, and chopped it\noff, and pops it in the pot.",
        "Suddenly he calls out: “Sally, my dear, Sally!” and nobody answered.\nSo he went into the next room to look out for Mrs. Miacca, and while\nhe was there, Tommy crept out from under the sofa and ran out of the\ndoor. For it was a leg of the sofa that he had put out.",
        "So Tommy Grimes ran home, and he never went round the corner again\ntill he was old enough to go alone.",
        "In the reign of the famous King Edward III. there was a little boy\ncalled Dick Whittington, whose father and mother died when he was very\nyoung. As poor Dick was not old enough to work, he was very badly off;\nhe got but little for his dinner, and sometimes nothing at all for his\nbreakfast; for the people who lived in the village were very poor\nindeed, and could not spare him much more than the parings of\npotatoes, and now and then a hard crust of bread.",
        "Now Dick had heard a great many very strange things about the great\ncity called London; for the country people at that time thought that\nfolks in London were all fine gentlemen and ladies; and that there was\nsinging and music there all day long; and that the streets were all\npaved with gold.",
        "One day a large waggon and eight horses, all with bells at their\nheads, drove through the village while Dick was standing by the sign-\npost. He thought that this waggon must be going to the fine town of\nLondon; so he took courage, and asked the waggoner to let him walk\nwith him by the side of the waggon. As soon as the waggoner heard that\npoor Dick had no father or mother, and saw by his ragged clothes that\nhe could not be worse off than he was, he told him he might go if he\nwould, so off they set together.",
        "So Dick got safe to London, and was in such a hurry to see the fine\nstreets paved all over with gold, that he did not even stay to thank\nthe kind waggoner; but ran off as fast as his legs would carry him,\nthrough many of the streets, thinking every moment to come to those\nthat were paved with gold; for Dick had seen a guinea three times in\nhis own little village, and remembered what a deal of money it brought\nin change; so he thought he had nothing to do but to take up some\nlittle bits of the pavement, and should then have as much money as he\ncould wish for.",
        "Poor Dick ran till he was tired, and had quite forgot his friend the\nwaggoner; but at last, finding it grow dark, and that every way he\nturned he saw nothing but dirt instead of gold, he, sat down in a dark\ncorner and cried himself to sleep.",
        "Little Dick was all night in the streets; and next morning, being very\nhungry, he got up and walked about, and asked everybody he met to give\nhim a halfpenny to keep him from starving; but nobody stayed to answer\nhim, and only two or three gave him a halfpenny; so that the poor boy\nwas soon quite weak and faint for the want of victuals.",
        "In this distress he asked charity of several people, and one of them\nsaid crossly: “Go to work, for an idle rogue.” “That I will,” says\nDick, “I will to go work for you, if you will let me.” But the man\nonly cursed at him and went on.",
        "At last a good-natured looking gentleman saw how hungry he looked.\n\"Why don’t you go to work my lad?” said he to Dick. “That I would, but\nI do not know how to get any,” answered Dick. “If you are willing,\ncome along with me,” said the gentleman, and took him to a hay-field,\nwhere Dick worked briskly, and lived merrily till the hay was made.",
        "After this he found himself as badly off as before; and being almost\nstarved again, he laid himself down at the door of Mr. Fitzwarren, a\nrich merchant. Here he was soon seen by the cook-maid, who was an ill-\ntempered creature, and happened just then to be very busy dressing\ndinner for her master and mistress; so she called out to poor Dick:\n\"What business have you there, you lazy rogue? there is nothing else\nbut beggars; if you do not take yourself away, we will see how you\nwill like a sousing of some dish-water; I have some here hot enough to\nmake you jump.”",
        "Just at that time Mr. Fitzwarren himself came home to dinner; and when\nhe saw a dirty ragged boy lying at the door, he said to him: “Why do\nyou lie there, my boy? You seem old enough to work; I am afraid you\nare inclined to be lazy.”",
        "“No, indeed, sir,” said Dick to him, “that is not the case, for I\nwould work with all my heart, but I do not know anybody, and I believe\nI am very sick for the want of food.”",
        "“Poor fellow, get up; let me see what ails you.” Dick now tried to\nrise, but was obliged to lie down again, being too weak to stand, for\nhe had not eaten any food for three days, and was no longer able to\nrun about and beg a halfpenny of people in the street. So the kind\nmerchant ordered him to be taken into the house, and have a good\ndinner given him, and be kept to do what work he was able to do for\nthe cook.",
        "Little Dick would have lived very happy in this good family if it had\nnot been for the ill-natured cook. She used to say: “You are under me,\nso look sharp; clean the spit and the dripping-pan, make the fires,\nwind up the jack, and do all the scullery work nimbly, or–” and she\nwould shake the ladle at him. Besides, she was so fond of basting,\nthat when she had no meat to baste, she would baste poor Dick’s head\nand shoulders with a broom, or anything else that happened to fall in\nher way. At last her ill-usage of him was told to Alice, Mr.\nFitzwarren’s daughter, who told the cook she should be turned away if\nshe did not treat him kinder.",
        "The behaviour of the cook was now a little better; but besides this\nDick had another hardship to get over. His bed stood in a garret,\nwhere there were so many holes in the floor and the walls that every\nnight he was tormented with rats and mice. A gentleman having given\nDick a penny for cleaning his shoes, he thought he would buy a cat\nwith it. The next day he saw a girl with a cat, and asked her, “Will\nyou let me have that cat for a penny?” The girl said: “Yes, that I\nwill, master, though she is an excellent mouser.”",
        "Dick hid his cat in the garret, and always took care to carry a part\nof his dinner to her; and in a short time he had no more trouble with\nthe rats and mice, but slept quite sound every night.",
        "Soon after this, his master had a ship ready to sail; and as it was\nthe custom that all his servants should have some chance for good\nfortune as well as himself, he called them all into the parlour and\nasked them what they would send out.",
        "They all had something that they were willing to venture except poor\nDick, who had neither money nor goods, and therefore could send\nnothing. For this reason he did not come into the parlour with the\nrest; but Miss Alice guessed what was the matter, and ordered him to\nbe called in. She then said: “I will lay down some money for him, from\nmy own purse;” but her father told her: “This will not do, for it must\nbe something of his own.”",
        "When poor Dick heard this, he said: “I have nothing but a cat which I\nbought for a penny some time since of a little girl.”",
        "“Fetch your cat then, my lad,” said Mr. Fitzwarren, “and let her go.”",
        "Dick went upstairs and brought down poor puss, with tears in his eyes,\nand gave her to the captain; “For,” he said, “I shall now be kept\nawake all night by the rats and mice.” All the company laughed at\nDick’s odd venture; and Miss Alice, who felt pity for him, gave him\nsome money to buy another cat.",
        "This, and many other marks of kindness shown him by Miss Alice, made\nthe ill-tempered cook jealous of poor Dick, and she began to use him\nmore cruelly than ever, and always made game of him for sending his\ncat to sea.",
        "She asked him: “Do you think your cat will sell for as much money as\nwould buy a stick to beat you?”",
        "At last poor Dick could not bear this usage any longer, and he thought\nhe would run away from his place; so he packed up his few things, and\nstarted very early in the morning, on All-hallows Day, the first of\nNovember. He walked as far as Holloway; and there sat down on a stone,\nwhich to this day is called “Whittington’s Stone,” and began to think\nto himself which road he should take.",
        "While he was thinking what he should do, the Bells of Bow Church,\nwhich at that time were only six, began to ring, and their sound\nseemed to say to him:",
        "“Turn again, Whittington,\nThrice Lord Mayor of London.”",
        "“Lord Mayor of London!” said he to himself. “Why, to be sure, I would\nput up with almost anything now, to be Lord Mayor of London, and ride\nin a fine coach, when I grow to be a man! Well, I will go back, and\nthink nothing of the cuffing and scolding of the old cook, if I am to\nbe Lord Mayor of London at last.”",
        "Dick went back, and was lucky enough to get into the house, and set\nabout his work, before the old cook came downstairs.",
        "We must now follow Miss Puss to the coast of Africa. The ship with the\ncat on board, was a long time at sea; and was at last driven by the\nwinds on a part of the coast of Barbary, where the only people were\nthe Moors, unknown to the English. The people came in great numbers to\nsee the sailors, because they were of different colour to themselves,\nand treated them civilly; and, when they became better acquainted,\nwere very eager to buy the fine things that the ship was loaded with.",
        "When the captain saw this, he sent patterns of the best things he had\nto the king of the country; who was so much pleased with them, that he\nsent for the captain to the palace. Here they were placed, as it is\nthe custom of the country, on rich carpets flowered with gold and\nsilver. The king and queen were seated at the upper end of the room;\nand a number of dishes were brought in for dinner. They had not sat\nlong, when a vast number of rats and mice rushed in, and devoured all\nthe meat in an instant. The captain wondered at this, and asked if\nthese vermin were not unpleasant.",
        "“Oh yes,” said they, “very offensive, and the king would give half his\ntreasure to be freed of them, for they not only destroy his dinner, as\nyou see, but they assault him in his chamber, and even in bed, and so\nthat he is obliged to be watched while he is sleeping, for fear of\nthem.”",
        "The captain jumped for joy; he remembered poor Whittington and his\ncat, and told the king he had a creature on board the ship that would\ndespatch all these vermin immediately. The king jumped so high at the\njoy which the news gave him, that his turban dropped off his head.\n\"Bring this creature to me,” says he; “vermin are dreadful in a court,\nand if she will perform what you say, I will load your ship with gold\nand jewels in exchange for her.”",
        "The captain, who knew his business, took this opportunity to set forth\nthe merits of Miss Puss. He told his majesty; “It is not very\nconvenient to part with her, as, when she is gone, the rats and mice\nmay destroy the goods in the ship–but to oblige your majesty, I will\nfetch her.”",
        "“Run, run!” said the queen; “I am impatient to see the dear creature.”",
        "Away went the captain to the ship, while another dinner was got ready.\nHe put Puss under his arm, and arrived at the place just in time to\nsee the table full of rats. When the cat saw them, she did not wait\nfor bidding, but jumped out of the captain’s arms, and in a few\nminutes laid almost all the rats and mice dead at her feet. The rest\nof them in their fright scampered away to their holes.",
        "The king was quite charmed to get rid so easily of such plagues, and\nthe queen desired that the creature who had done them so great a\nkindness might be brought to her, that she might look at her. Upon\nwhich the captain called: “Pussy, pussy, pussy!” and she came to him.\nHe then presented her to the queen, who started back, and was afraid\nto touch a creature who had made such a havoc among the rats and mice.\nHowever, when the captain stroked the cat and called: “Pussy, pussy,\"\nthe queen also touched her and cried: “Putty, putty,” for she had not\nlearned English. He then put her down on the queen’s lap, where she\npurred and played with her majesty’s hand, and then purred herself to\nsleep.",
        "The king, having seen the exploits of Mrs. Puss, and being informed\nthat her kittens would stock the whole country, and keep it free from\nrats, bargained with the captain for the whole ship’s cargo, and then\ngave him ten times as much for the cat as all the rest amounted to.",
        "The captain then took leave of the royal party, and set sail with a\nfair wind for England, and after a happy voyage arrived safe in\nLondon.",
        "One morning, early, Mr. Fitzwarren had just come to his counting-house\nand seated himself at the desk, to count over the cash, and settle the\nbusiness for the day, when somebody came tap, tap, at the door. “Who’s\nthere?” said Mr. Fitzwarren. “A friend,” answered the other; “I come\nto bring you good news of your ship Unicorn.” The merchant,\nbustling up in such a hurry that he forgot his gout, opened the door,\nand who should he see waiting but the captain and factor, with a\ncabinet of jewels, and a bill of lading; when he looked at this the\nmerchant lifted up his eyes and thanked Heaven for sending him such a\nprosperous voyage.",
        "They then told the story of the cat, and showed the rich present that\nthe king and queen had sent for her to poor Dick. As soon as the\nmerchant heard this, he called out to his servants:",
        "  “Go send him in, and tell him of his fame;\n  Pray call him Mr. Whittington by name.”",
        "Mr. Fitzwarren now showed himself to be a good man; for when some of\nhis servants said so great a treasure was too much for him, he\nanswered: “God forbid I should deprive him of the value of a single\npenny, it is his own, and he shall have it to a farthing.” He then\nsent for Dick, who at that time was scouring pots for the cook, and\nwas quite dirty. He would have excused himself from coming into the\ncounting-house, saying, “The room is swept, and my shoes are dirty and\nfull of hob-nails.” But the merchant ordered him to come in.",
        "Mr. Fitzwarren ordered a chair to be set for him, and so he began to\nthink they were making game of him, at the same time said to them: “Do\nnot play tricks with a poor simple boy, but let me go down again, if\nyou please, to my work.”",
        "“Indeed, Mr. Whittington,” said the merchant, “we are all quite in\nearnest with you, and I most heartily rejoice in the news that these\ngentlemen have brought you; for the captain has sold your cat to the\nKing of Barbary, and brought you in return for her more riches than I\npossess in the whole world; and I wish you may long enjoy them!”",
        "Mr. Fitzwarren then told the men to open the great treasure they had\nbrought with them; and said: “Mr. Whittington has nothing to do but to\nput it in some place of safety.”",
        "Poor Dick hardly knew how to behave himself for joy. He begged his\nmaster to take what part of it he pleased, since he owed it all to his\nkindness. “No, no,” answered Mr. Fitzwarren, “this is all your own;\nand I have no doubt but you will use it well.”",
        "Dick next asked his mistress, and then Miss Alice, to accept a part of\nhis good fortune; but they would not, and at the same time told him\nthey felt great joy at his good success. But this poor fellow was too\nkind-hearted to keep it all to himself; so he made a present to the\ncaptain, the mate, and the rest of Mr. Fitzwarren’s servants; and even\nto the ill-natured old cook.",
        "After this Mr. Fitzwarren advised him to send for a proper tailor and\nget himself dressed like a gentleman; and told him he was welcome to\nlive in his house till he could provide himself with a better.",
        "When Whittington’s face was washed, his hair curled, his hat cocked,\nand he was dressed in a nice suit of clothes he was as handsome and\ngenteel as any young man who visited at Mr. Fitzwarren’s; so that Miss\nAlice, who had once been so kind to him, and thought of him with pity,\nnow looked upon him as fit to be her sweetheart; and the more so, no\ndoubt, because Whittington was now always thinking what he could do to\noblige her, and making her the prettiest presents that could be.",
        "Mr. Fitzwarren soon saw their love for each other, and proposed to\njoin them in marriage; and to this they both readily agreed. A day for\nthe wedding was soon fixed; and they were attended to church by the\nLord Mayor, the court of aldermen, the sheriffs, and a great number of\nthe richest merchants in London, whom they afterwards treated with a\nvery rich feast.",
        "History tells us that Mr. Whittington and his lady liven in great\nsplendour, and were very happy. They had several children. He was\nSheriff of London, thrice Lord Mayor, and received the honour of\nknighthood by Henry V.",
        "He entertained this king and his queen at dinner after his conquest of\nFrance so grandly, that the king said “Never had prince such a\nsubject;” when Sir Richard heard this, he said: “Never had subject\nsuch a prince.”",
        "The figure of Sir Richard Whittington with his cat in his arms, carved\nin stone, was to be seen till the year 1780 over the archway of the\nold prison of Newgate, which he built for criminals.",

        "In Bamborough Castle once lived a king who had a fair wife and two\nchildren, a son named Childe Wynd and a daughter named Margaret.\nChilde Wynd went forth to seek his fortune, and soon after he had gone\nthe queen his mother died. The king mourned her long and faithfully,\nbut one day while he was hunting he came across a lady of great\nbeauty, and became so much in love with her that he determined to\nmarry her. So he sent word home that he was going to bring a new queen\nto Bamborough Castle.",
        "Princess Margaret was not very glad to hear of her mother’s place\nbeing taken, but she did not repine but did her father’s bidding. And\nat the appointed day came down to the castle gate with the keys all\nready to hand over to her stepmother. Soon the procession drew near,\nand the new queen came towards Princess Margaret who bowed low and\nhanded her the keys of the castle. She stood there with blushing\ncheeks and eye on ground, and said: “O welcome, father dear, to your\nhalls and bowers, and welcome to you my new mother, for all that’s\nhere is yours,” and again she offered the keys. One of the king’s\nknights who had escorted the new queen, cried out in admiration:\n\"Surely this northern Princess is the loveliest of her kind.” At that\nthe new queen flushed up and cried out: “At least your courtesy might\nhave excepted me,” and then she muttered below her breath: “I’ll soon\nput an end to her beauty.”",
        "That same night the queen, who was a noted witch, stole down to a\nlonely dungeon wherein she did her magic and with spells three times\nthree, and with passes nine times nine she cast Princess Margaret\nunder her spell. And this was her spell:",
        "  I weird ye to be a Laidly Worm,\n    And borrowed shall ye never be,\n  Until Childe Wynd, the King’s own son\n    Come to the Heugh and thrice kiss thee;\n  Until the world comes to an end,\n    Borrowed shall ye never be.",
        "So Lady Margaret went to bed a beauteous maiden, and rose up a Laidly\nWorm. And when her maidens came in to dress her in the morning they\nfound coiled up on the bed a dreadful dragon, which uncoiled itself\nand came towards them. But they ran away shrieking, and the Laidly\nWorm crawled and crept, and crept and crawled till it reached the\nHeugh or rock of the Spindlestone, round which it coiled itself, and\nlay there basking with its terrible snout in the air.",
        "Soon the country round about had reason to know of the Laidly Worm of\nSpindleston Heugh. For hunger drove the monster out from its cave and\nit used to devour everything it could come across. So at last they\nwent to a mighty warlock and asked him what they should do. Then he\nconsulted his works and his familiar, and told them: “The Laidly Worm\nis really the Princess Margaret and it is hunger that drives her forth\nto do such deeds. Put aside for her seven kine, and each day as the\nsun goes down, carry every drop of milk they yield to the stone trough\nat the foot of the Heugh, and the Laidly Worm will trouble the country\nno longer. But if ye would that she be borrowed to her natural shape,\nand that she who bespelled her be rightly punished, send over the seas\nfor her brother, Childe Wynd.”",
        "All was done as the warlock advised, the Laidly Worm lived on the milk\nof the seven kine, and the country was troubled no longer. But when\nChilde Wynd heard the news, he swore a mighty oath to rescue his\nsister and revenge her on her cruel stepmother. And three-and-thirty\nof his men took the oath with him. Then they set to work and built a\nlong ship, and its keel they made of the rowan tree. And when all was\nready, they out with their oars and pulled sheer for Bamborough Keep.",
        "But as they got near the keep, the stepmother felt by her magic power\nthat something was being wrought against her, so she summoned her\nfamiliar imps and said: “Childe Wynd is coming over the seas; he must\nnever land. Raise storms, or bore the hull, but nohow must he touch\nshore.” Then the imps went forth to meet Childe Wynd’s ship, but when\nthey got near, they found they had no power over the ship, for its\nkeel was made of the rowan tree. So back they came to the queen witch,\nwho knew not what to do. She ordered her men-at-arms to resist Childe\nWynd if he should land near them, and by her spells she caused the\nLaidly Worm to wait by the entrance of the harbour.",
        "As the ship came near, the Worm unfolded its coils, and dipping into\nthe sea, caught hold of the ship of Childe Wynd, and banged it off the\nshore. Three times Childe Wynd urged his men on to row bravely and\nstrong, but each time the Laidly Worm kept it off the shore. Then\nChilde Wynd ordered the ship to be put about, and the witch-queen\nthought he had given up the attempt. But instead of that, he only\nrounded the next point and landed safe and sound in Budle Creek, and\nthen, with sword drawn and bow bent, rushed up followed by his men, to\nfight the terrible Worm that had kept him from landing.",
        "But the moment Childe Wynd had landed, the witch-queen’s power over\nthe Laidly Worm had gone, and she went back to her bower all alone,\nnot an imp, nor a man-at-arms to help her, for she knew her hour was\ncome. So when Childe Wynd came rushing up to the Laidly Worm it made\nno attempt to stop him or hurt him, but just as he was going to raise\nhis sword to slay it, the voice of his own sister Margaret came from\nits jaws saying:",
        "  “O, quit your sword, unbend your bow,\n    And give me kisses three;\n  For though I am a poisonous worm,\n    No harm I’ll do to thee.”",
        "Childe Wynd stayed his hand, but he did not know what to think if some\nwitchery were not in it. Then said the Laidly Worm again:",
        "  “O, quit your sword, unbend your bow,\n    And give me kisses three,\n  If I’m not won ere set of sun,\n    Won never shall I be.”",
        "Then Childe Wynd went up to the Laidly Worm and kissed it once; but no\nchange came over it. Then Childe Wynd kissed it once more; but yet no\nchange came over it. For a third time he kissed the loathsome thing,\nand with a hiss and a roar the Laidly Worm reared back and before\nChilde Wynd stood his sister Margaret. He wrapped his cloak about her,\nand then went up to the castle with her. When he reached the keep, he\nwent off to the witch queen’s bower, and when he saw her, he touched\nher with a twig of a rowan tree. No sooner had he touched her than she\nshrivelled up and shrivelled up, till she became a huge ugly toad,\nwith bold staring eyes and a horrible hiss. She croaked and she\nhissed, and then hopped away down the castle steps, and Childe Wynd\ntook his father’s place as king, and they all lived happy afterwards.",
        "But to this day, the loathsome toad is seen at times, haunting the\nneighbourhood of Bamborough Keep, and the wicked witch-queen is a\nLaidly Toad.",

        "    “Yes,” says the baker, “I’ll give you some bread,\n    But if you eat my meal, I’ll cut off your head.”",
        "Then the baker gave mouse bread, and mouse gave butcher bread, and\nbutcher gave mouse meat, and mouse gave farmer meat, and farmer gave\nmouse hay, and mouse gave cow hay, and cow gave mouse milk, and mouse\ngave cat milk, and cat gave mouse her own tail again!",
        "Once upon a time, there was a mighty baron in the North Countrie who\nwas a great magician that knew everything that would come to pass. So\none day, when his little boy was four years old, he looked into the\nBook of Fate to see what would happen to him. And to his dismay, he\nfound that his son would wed a lowly maid that had just been born in a\nhouse under the shadow of York Minster. Now the Baron knew the father\nof the little girl was very, very poor, and he had five children\nalready. So he called for his horse, and rode into York; and passed by\nthe father’s house, and saw him sitting by the door, sad and doleful.\nSo he dismounted and went up to him and said: “What is the matter, my\ngood man?” And the man said: “Well, your honour, the fact is, I’ve\nfive children already, and now a sixth’s come, a little lass, and\nwhere to get the bread from to fill their mouths, that’s more than I\ncan say.”",
        "“Don’t be downhearted, my man,” said the Baron. “If that’s your\ntrouble, I can help you. I’ll take away the last little one, and you\nwont have to bother about her.”",
        "“Thank you kindly, sir,” said the man; and he went in and brought out\nthe lass and gave her to the Baron, who mounted his horse and rode\naway with her. And when he got by the bank of the river Ouse, he threw\nthe little, thing into the river, and rode off to his castle.",
        "But the little lass didn’t sink; her clothes kept her up for a time,\nand she floated, and she floated, till she was cast ashore just in\nfront of a fisherman’s hut. There the fisherman found her, and took\npity on the poor little thing and took her into his house, and she\nlived there till she was fifteen years old, and a fine handsome girl.",
        "One day it happened that the Baron went out hunting with some\ncompanions along the banks of the River Ouse, and stopped at the\nfisherman’s hut to get a drink, and the girl came out to give it to\nthem. They all noticed her beauty, and one of them said to the Baron:\n\"You can read fates, Baron, whom will she marry, d’ye think?”",
        "“Oh! that’s easy to guess,” said the Baron; “some yokel or other. But\nI’ll cast her horoscope. Come here girl, and tell me on what day you\nwere born?”",
        "“I don’t know, sir,” said the girl, “I was picked up just here after\nhaving been brought down by the river about fifteen years ago.”",
        "Then the Baron knew who she was, and when they went away, he rode back\nand said to the girl: “Hark ye, girl, I will make your fortune. Take\nthis letter to my brother in Scarborough, and you will be settled for\nlife.” And the girl took the letter and said she would go. Now this\nwas what he had written in the letter:",
        "“Dear Brother,–Take the bearer and put her to death immediately.",
        "“Yours affectionately,",
        "“Albert.”",
        "So soon after the girl set out for Scarborough, and slept for the\nnight at a little inn. Now that very night a band of robbers broke\ninto the inn, and searched the girl, who had no money, and only the\nletter. So they opened this and read it, and thought it a shame. The\ncaptain of the robbers took a pen and paper and wrote this letter:",
        "“Dear Brother,–Take the bearer and marry her to my son immediately.",
        "“Yours affectionately,",
        "“Albert.”",
        "And then he gave it to the girl, bidding her begone. So she went on to\nthe Baron’s brother at Scarborough, a noble knight, with whom the\nBaron’s son was staying. When she gave the letter to his brother, he\ngave orders for the wedding to be prepared at once, and they were\nmarried that very day.",
        "Soon after, the Baron himself came to his brother’s castle, and what\nwas his surprise to find that the very thing he had plotted against\nhad come to pass. But he was not to be put off that way; and he took\nout the girl for a walk, as he said, along the cliffs. And when he got\nher all alone, he took her by the arms, and was going to throw her\nover. But she begged hard for her life. “I have not done anything,\"\nshe said: “if you will only spare me, I will do whatever you wish. I\nwill never see you or your son again till you desire it.” Then the\nBaron took off his gold ring and threw it into the sea, saying: “Never\nlet me see your face till you can show me that ring;” and he let her\ngo.",
        "The poor girl wandered on and on, till at last she came to a great\nnoble’s castle, and she asked to have some work given to her; and they\nmade her the scullion girl of the castle, for she had been used to\nsuch work in the fisherman’s hut.",
        "Now one day, who should she see coming up to the noble’s house but the\nBaron and his brother and his son, her husband. She didn’t know what\nto do; but thought they would not see her in the castle kitchen. So\nshe went back to her work with a sigh, and set to cleaning a huge big\nfish that was to be boiled for their dinner. And, as she was cleaning\nit, she saw something shine inside it, and what do you think she\nfound? Why, there was the Baron’s ring, the very one he had thrown\nover the cliff at Scarborough. She was right glad to see it, you may\nbe sure. Then she cooked the fish as nicely as she could, and served\nit up.",
        "Well, when the fish came on the table, the guests liked it so well\nthat they asked the noble who cooked it. He said he didn’t know, but\ncalled to his servants: “Ho, there, send up the cook that cooked that\nfine fish.” So they went down to the kitchen and told the girl she was\nwanted in the hall. Then she washed and tidied herself and put the\nBaron’s gold ring on her thumb and went up into the hall.",
        "When the banqueters saw such a young and beautiful cook they were\nsurprised. But the Baron was in a tower of a temper, and started up as\nif he would do her some violence. So the girl went up to him with her\nhand before her with the ring on it; and she put it down before him on\nthe table. Then at last the Baron saw that no one could fight against\nFate, and he handed her to a seat and announced to all the company\nthat this was his son’s true wife; and he took her and his son home to\nhis castle; and they all lived as happy as could be ever afterwards.",
        "  Once upon a time when pigs spoke rhyme\n  And monkeys chewed tobacco,\n  And hens took snuff to make them tough,\n  And ducks went quack, quack, quack, O!",
        "All the birds of the air came to the magpie and asked her to teach\nthem how to build nests. For the magpie is the cleverest bird of all\nat building nests. So she put all the birds round her and began to\nshow them how to do it. First of all she took some mud and made a sort\nof round cake with it.",
        "“Oh, that’s how it’s done,” said the thrush; and away it flew, and so\nthat’s how thrushes build their nests.",
        "Then the magpie took some twigs and arranged them round in the mud.",
        "“Now I know all about it,” says the blackbird, and off he flew; and\nthat’s how the blackbirds make their nests to this very day.",
        "Then the magpie put another layer of mud over the twigs.",
        "“Oh that’s quite obvious,” said the wise owl, and away it flew; and\nowls have never made better nests since.",
        "After this the magpie took some twigs and twined them round the\noutside.",
        "“The very thing!” said the sparrow, and off be went; so sparrows make\nrather slovenly nests to this day.",
        "Well, then Madge Magpie took some feathers and stuff and lined the\nnest very comfortably with it.",
        "“That suits me,” cried the starling, and off it flew; and very\ncomfortable nests have starlings.",
        "So it went on, every bird taking away some knowledge of how to build\nnests, but, none of them waiting to the end. Meanwhile Madge Magpie\nwent on working and working without, looking up till the only bird\nthat remained was the turtle-dove, and that hadn’t paid any attention\nall along, but only kept on saying its silly cry “Take two, Taffy,\ntake two-o-o-o.”",
        "At last the magpie heard this just as she was putting a twig across.\nSo she said: “One’s enough.”",
        "But the turtle-dove kept on saying: “Take two, Taffy, take two-o-o-o.”",
        "Then the magpie got angry and said: “One’s enough I tell you.”",
        "Still the turtle-dove cried: “Take two, Taffy, take two-o-o-o.”",
        "At last, and at last, the magpie looked up and saw nobody near her but\nthe silly turtle-dove, and then she got rare angry and flew away and\nrefused to tell the birds how to build nests again. And that is why\ndifferent birds build their nests differently.",
        "Once upon a time there was a king and a queen, as in many lands have\nbeen. The king had a daughter, Anne, and the queen had one named Kate,\nbut Anne was far bonnier than the queen’s daughter, though they loved\none another like real sisters. The queen was jealous of the king’s\ndaughter being bonnier than her own, and cast about to spoil her\nbeauty. So she took counsel of the henwife, who told her to send the\nlassie to her next morning fasting.",
        "So next morning early, the queen said to Anne, “Go, my dear, to the\nhenwife in the glen, and ask her for some eggs.” So Anne set out, but\nas she passed through the kitchen she saw a crust, and she took and\nmunched it as she went along.",
        "When she came to the henwife’s she asked for eggs, as she had been\ntold to do; the henwife said to her, “Lift the lid off that pot there\nand see.” The lassie did so, but nothing happened. “Go home to your\nminnie and tell her to keep her larder door better locked,” said the\nhenwife. So she went home to the queen and told her what the henwife\nhad said. The queen knew from this that the lassie had had something\nto eat, so watched the next morning and sent her away fasting; but the\nprincess saw some country-folk picking peas by the roadside, and being\nvery kind she spoke to them and took a handful of the peas, which she\nate by the way.",
        "When she came to the henwife’s, she said, “Lift the lid off the pot\nand you’ll see.” So Anne lifted the lid but nothing happened. Then the\nhenwife was rare angry and said to Anne, “Tell your minnie the pot\nwon’t boil if the fire’s away.” So Anne went home and told the queen.",
        "The third day the queen goes along with the girl herself to the\nhenwife. Now, this time, when Anne lifted the lid off the pot, off\nfalls her own pretty head, and on jumps a sheep’s head.",
        "So the queen was now quite satisfied, and went back home.",
        "Her own daughter, Kate, however, took a fine linen cloth and wrapped\nit round her sister’s head and took her by the hand and they both went\nout to seek their fortune. They went on, and they went on, and they\nwent on, till they came to a castle. Kate knocked at the door and\nasked for a night’s lodging for herself and a sick sister. They went\nin and found it was a king’s castle, who had two sons, and one of them\nwas sickening away to death and no one could find out what ailed him.\nAnd the curious thing was that whoever watched him at night was never\nseen any more. So the king had offered a peck of silver to anyone who\nwould stop up with him. Now Katie was a very brave girl, so she\noffered to sit up with him.",
        "Till midnight all goes well. As twelve o clock rings, however, the\nsick prince rises, dresses himself, and slips downstairs. Kate\nfollowed, but he didn’t seem to notice her. The prince went to the\nstable, saddled his horse, called his hound, jumped into the saddle,\nand Kate leapt lightly up behind him. Away rode the prince and Kate\nthrough the greenwood, Kate, as they pass, plucking nuts from the\ntrees and filling her apron with them. They rode on and on till they\ncame to a green hill. The prince here drew bridle and spoke, “Open,\nopen, green hill, and let the young prince in with his horse and his\nhound,” and Kate added, “and his lady him behind.”",
        "Immediately the green hill opened and they passed in. The prince\nentered a magnificent hall, brightly lighted up, and many beautiful\nfairies surrounded the prince and led him off to the dance. Meanwhile,\nKate, without being noticed, hid herself behind the door. There she\nsees the prince dancing, and dancing, and dancing, till he could dance\nno longer and fell upon a couch. Then the fairies would fan him till\nhe could rise again and go on dancing.",
        "At last the cock crew, and the prince made all haste to get on\nhorseback; Kate jumped up behind, and home they rode. When the morning\nsun rose they came in and found Kate sitting down by the fire and\ncracking her nuts. Kate said the prince had a good night; but she\nwould not sit up another night unless she was to get a peck of gold.\nThe second night passed as the first had done. The prince got up at\nmidnight and rode away to the green hill and the fairy ball, and Kate\nwent with him, gathering nuts as they rode through the forest. This\ntime she did not watch the prince, for she knew he would dance and\ndance, and dance. But she sees a fairy baby playing with a wand, and\noverhears one of the fairies say: “Three strokes of that wand would\nmake Kate’s sick sister as bonnie as ever she was.” So Kate rolled\nnuts to the fairy baby, and rolled nuts till the baby toddled after\nthe nuts and let fall the wand, and Kate took it up and put it in her\napron. And at cockcrow they rode home as before, and the moment Kate\ngot home to her room she rushed and touched Anne three times with the\nwand, and the nasty sheep’s head fell off and she was her own pretty\nself again. The third night Kate consented to watch, only if she\nshould marry the sick prince. All went on as on the first two nights.\nThis time the fairy baby was playing with a birdie; Kate heard one of\nthe fairies say: “Three bites of that birdie would make the sick\nprince as well as ever he was.” Kate rolled all the nuts she had to\nthe fairy baby till the birdie was dropped, and Kate put it in her\napron.",
        "At cockcrow they set off again, but instead of cracking her nuts as\nshe used to do, this time Kate plucked the feathers off and cooked the\nbirdie. Soon there arose a very savoury smell. “Oh!” said the sick\nprince, “I wish I had a bite of that birdie,” so Kate gave him a bite\nof the birdie, and he rose up on his elbow. By-and-by he cried out\nagain: “Oh, if I had another bite of that birdie!” so Kate gave him\nanother bite, and he sat up on his bed. Then he said again: “Oh! if I\nonly had a third bite of that birdie!” So Kate gave him a third bite,\nand he rose quite well, dressed himself, and sat down by the fire, and\nwhen the folk came in next morning they found Kate and the young\nprince cracking nuts together. Meanwhile his brother had seen Annie\nand had fallen in love with her, as everybody did who saw her sweet\npretty face. So the sick son married the well sister, and the well son\nmarried the sick sister, and they all lived happy and died happy, and\nnever drank out of a dry cappy.",
        "At Hilton Hall, long years ago, there lived a Brownie that was the\ncontrariest Brownie you ever knew. At night, after the servants had\ngone to bed, it would turn everything topsy-turvy, put sugar in the\nsalt-cellars, pepper into the beer, and was up to all kinds of pranks.\nIt would throw the chairs down, put tables on their backs, rake out\nfires, and do as much mischief as could be. But sometimes it would be\nin a good temper, and then!–\"What’s a Brownie?” you say. Oh, it’s a\nkind of a sort of a Bogle, but it isn’t so cruel as a Redcap! What!\nyou don’t know what’s a Bogle or a Redcap! Ah, me! what’s the world a-\ncoming to? Of course a Brownie is a funny little thing, half man, half\ngoblin, with pointed ears and hairy hide. When you bury a treasure,\nyou scatter over it blood drops of a newly slain kid or lamb, or,\nbetter still, bury the animal with the treasure, and a Brownie will\nwatch over it for you, and frighten everybody else away.",
        "Where was I? Well, as I was a-saying, the Brownie at Hilton Hall would\nplay at mischief, but if the servants laid out for it a bowl of cream,\nor a knuckle cake spread with honey, it would clear away things for\nthem, and make everything tidy in the kitchen. One night, however,\nwhen the servants had stopped up late, they heard a noise in the\nkitchen, and, peeping in, saw the Brownie swinging to and fro on the\nJack chain, and saying:",
        "  “Woe’s me! woe’s me!\n  The acorn’s not yet\n  Fallen from the tree,\n  That’s to grow the wood,\n  That’s to make the cradle,\n  That’s to rock the bairn,\n  That’s to grow to the man,\n  That’s to lay me.\n  Woe’s me! woe’s me!”",
        "So they took pity on the poor Brownie, and asked the nearest henwife\nwhat they should do to send it away. “That’s easy enough,” said the\nhenwife, and told them that a Brownie that’s paid for its service, in\naught that’s not perishable, goes away at once. So they made a cloak\nof Lincoln green, with a hood to it, and put it by the hearth and\nwatched. They saw the Brownie come up, and seeing the hood and cloak,\nput them on, and frisk about, dancing on one leg and saying:",
        "  “I’ve taken your cloak, I’ve taken your hood;\n  The Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more good.”",
        "And with that it vanished, and was never seen or heard of afterwards.",
        "A lad named Jack was once so unhappy at home through his father’s ill-\ntreatment, that he made up his mind to run away and seek his fortune\nin the wide world.",
        "He ran, and he ran, till he could run no longer, and then he ran right\nup against a little old woman who was gathering sticks. He was too\nmuch out of breath to beg pardon, but the woman was good-natured, and\nshe said he seemed to be a likely lad, so she would take him to be her\nservant, and would pay him well. He agreed, for he was very hungry,\nand she brought him to her house in the wood, where he served her for\na twelvemonths and a day.",
        "When the year had passed, she called him to her, and said she had good\nwages for him. So she presented him with an ass out of the stable, and\nhe had but to pull Neddy’s ears to make him begin at once to ee–aw!\nAnd when he brayed there dropped from his mouth silver sixpences, and\nhalf crowns, and golden guineas.",
        "The lad was well pleased with the wage he had received, and away he\nrode till he reached an inn. There he ordered the best of everything,\nand when the innkeeper refused to serve him without being paid\nbeforehand, the boy went off to the stable, pulled the ass’s ears and\nobtained his pocket full of money. The host had watched all this\nthrough a crack in the door, and when night came on he put an ass of\nhis own for the precious Neddy of the poor youth. So Jack without\nknowing that any change had been made, rode away next morning to his\nfather’s house.",
        "Now, I must tell you that near his home dwelt a poor widow with an\nonly daughter. The lad and the maiden were fast friends and true\nloves; but when Jack asked his father’s leave to marry the girl,\n\"Never till you have the money to keep her,” was the reply. “I have\nthat, father,” said the lad, and going to the ass he pulled its long\nears; well, he pulled, and he pulled, till one of them came off in his\nhands; but Neddy, though he hee-hawed and he hee-hawed let fall no\nhalf crowns or guineas. The father picked up a hay-fork and beat his\nson out of the house. I promise you he ran. Ah! he ran and ran till he\ncame bang against the door, and burst it open, and there he was in a\njoiner’s shop. “You’re a likely lad,” said the joiner; “serve me for a\ntwelvemonths and a day and I will pay you well.’” So he agreed, and\nserved the carpenter for a year and a day. “Now,” said the master, “I\nwill give you your wage;” and he presented him with a table, telling\nhim he had but to say, “Table, be covered,” and at once it would be\nspread with lots to eat and drink.",
        "Jack hitched the table on his back, and away he went with it till he\ncame to the inn. “Well, host,” shouted he, “my dinner to-day, and that\nof the best.”",
        "“Very sorry, but there is nothing in the house but ham and eggs.”",
        "“Ham and eggs for me!” exclaimed Jack. “I can do better than that.–\nCome, my table, be covered!”",
        "At once the table was spread with turkey and sausages, roast mutton,\npotatoes, and greens. The publican opened his eyes, but he said\nnothing, not he.",
        "That night he fetched down from his attic a table very like that of\nJack, and exchanged the two. Jack, none the wiser, next morning\nhitched the worthless table on to his back and carried it home. “Now,\nfather, may I marry my lass?” he asked.",
        "“Not unless you can keep her,” replied the father. “Look here!\"\nexclaimed Jack. “Father, I have a table which does all my bidding.”",
        "“Let me see it,” said the old man.",
        "The lad set it in the middle of the room, and bade it be covered; but\nall in vain, the table remained bare. In a rage, the father caught the\nwarming-pan down from the wall and warmed his son’s back with it so\nthat the boy fled howling from the house, and ran and ran till he came\nto a river and tumbled in. A man picked him out and bade him assist\nhim in making a bridge over the river; and how do you think he was\ndoing it? Why, by casting a tree across; so Jack climbed up to the top\nof the tree and threw his weight on it, so that when the man had\nrooted the tree up, Jack and the tree-head dropped on the farther\nbank.",
        "“Thank you,” said the man; “and now for what you have done I will pay\nyou;” so saying, he tore a branch from the tree, and fettled it up\ninto a club with his knife. “There,” exclaimed he; “take this stick,\nand when you say to it, ’Up stick and bang him,’ it will knock any one\ndown who angers you.”",
        "The lad was overjoyed to get this stick–so away he went with it to\nthe inn, and as soon as the publican, appeared, “Up stick and bang\nhim!” was his cry. At the word the cudgel flew from his hand and\nbattered the old publican on the back, rapped his head, bruised his\narms tickled his ribs, till he fell groaning on the floor; still the\nstick belaboured the prostrate man, nor would Jack call it off till he\nhad got back the stolen ass and table. Then he galloped home on the\nass, with the table on his shoulders, and the stick in his hand. When\nhe arrived there he found his father was dead, so he brought his ass\ninto the stable, and pulled its ears till he had filled the manger\nwith money.",
        "It was soon known through the town that Jack had returned rolling in\nwealth, and accordingly all the girls in the place set their caps at\nhim. “Now,” said Jack, “I shall marry the richest lass in the place;\nso tomorrow do you all come in front of my house with your money in\nyour aprons.”",
        "Next morning the street was full of girls with aprons held out, and\ngold and silver in them; but Jack’s own sweetheart was among them, and\nshe had neither gold nor silver, nought but two copper pennies, that\nwas all she had.",
        "“Stand aside, lass;” said Jack to her, speaking roughly. “Thou hast no\nsilver nor gold–stand off from the rest.” She obeyed, and the tears\nran down her cheeks, and filled her apron with diamonds.",
        "“Up stick and bang them!” exclaimed Jack; whereupon the cudgel leaped\nup, and running along the line of girls, knocked them all on the heads\nand left them senseless on the pavement. Jack took all their money and\npoured it into his truelove’s lap. “Now, lass,” he exclaimed, “thou\nart the richest, and I shall marry thee.”",
        "Dame Goody was a nurse that looked after sick people, and minded\nbabies. One night she was woke up at midnight, and when she went\ndownstairs, she saw a strange squinny-eyed, little ugly old fellow,\nwho asked her to come to his wife who was too ill to mind her baby.\nDame Goody didn’t like the look of the old fellow, but business is\nbusiness; so she popped on her things, and went down to him. And when\nshe got down to him, he whisked her up on to a large coal-black horse\nwith fiery eyes, that stood at the door; and soon they were going at a\nrare pace, Dame Goody holding on to the old fellow like grim death.",
        "They rode, and they rode, till at last they stopped before a cottage\ndoor. So they got down and went in and found the good woman abed with\nthe children playing about; and the babe, a fine bouncing boy, beside\nher.",
        "Dame Goody took the babe, which was as fine a baby boy as you’d wish\nto see. The mother, when she handed the baby to Dame Goody to mind,\ngave her a box of ointment, and told her to stroke the baby’s eyes\nwith it as soon as it opened them. After a while it began to open its\neyes. Dame Goody saw that it had squinny eyes just like its father. So\nshe took the box of ointment and stroked its two eyelids with it. But\nshe couldn’t help wondering what it was for, as she had never seen\nsuch a thing done before. So she looked to see if the others were\nlooking, and, when they were not noticing she stroked her own right\neyelid with the ointment.",
        "No sooner had she done so, than everything seemed changed about her.\nThe cottage became elegantly furnished. The mother in the bed was a\nbeautiful lady, dressed up in white silk. The little baby was still\nmore beautiful than before, and its clothes were made of a sort of\nsilvery gauze. Its little brothers and sisters around the bed were\nflat-nosed imps with pointed ears, who made faces at one another, and\nscratched their polls. Sometimes they would pull the sick lady’s ears\nwith their long and hairy paws. In fact, they were up to all kinds of\nmischief; and Dame Goody knew that she had got into a house of pixies.\nBut she said nothing to nobody, and as soon as the lady was well\nenough to mind the baby, she asked the old fellow to take her back\nhome. So he came round to the door with the coal-black horse with eyes\nof fire, and off they went as fast as before, or perhaps a little\nfaster, till they came to Dame Goody’s cottage, where the squinny-eyed\nold fellow lifted her down and left her, thanking her civilly enough,\nand paying her more than she had ever been paid before for such\nservice.",
        "Now next day happened to be market-day, and as Dame Goody had been\naway from home, she wanted many things in the house, and trudged off\nto get them at the market. As she was buying the things she wanted,\nwho should she see but the squinny-eyed old fellow who had taken her\non the coal-black horse. And what do you think he was doing? Why he\nwent about from stall to stall taking up things from each, here some\nfruit, and there some eggs, and so on; and no one seemed to take any\nnotice.",
        "Now Dame Goody did not think it her business to interfere, but she\nthought she ought not to let so good a customer pass without speaking.\nSo she ups to him and bobs a curtsey and said: “Gooden, sir, I hopes\nas how your good lady and the little one are as well as––”",
        "But she couldn’t finish what she was a-saying, for the funny old\nfellow started back in surprise, and he says to her, says he: “What!\ndo you see me today?”",
        "“See you,” says she, “why, of course I do, as plain as the sun in the\nskies, and what’s more,” says she, “I see you are busy too, into the\nbargain.”",
        "“Ah, you see too much,” said he; “now, pray, with which eye do you see\nall this?”",
        "“With the right eye to be sure,” said she, as proud as can be to find\nhim out.",
        "“The ointment! The ointment!” cried the old pixy thief. “Take that for\nmeddling with what don’t concern you: you shall see me no more.” And\nwith that he struck her on her right eye, and she couldn’t see him any\nmore; and, what was worse, she was blind on the right side from that\nhour till the day of her death.",
        "Once upon a time, and a very good time it was, though it wasn’t in my\ntime, nor in your time, nor any one else’s time, there was a girl\nwhose mother had died, and her father had married again. And her\nstepmother hated her because she was more beautiful than herself, and\nshe was very cruel to her. She used to make her do all the servant’s\nwork, and never let her have any peace. At last, one day, the\nstepmother thought to get rid of her altogether; so she handed her a\nsieve and said to her: “Go, fill it at the Well of the World’s End and\nbring it home to me full, or woe betide you.” For she thought she\nwould never be able to find the Well of the World’s End, and, if she\ndid, how could she bring home a sieve full of water?",
        "Well, the girl started off, and asked every one she met to tell her\nwhere was the Well of the World’s End. But nobody knew, and she didn’t\nknow what to do, when a queer little old woman, all bent double, told\nher where it was, and how she could get to it. So she did what the old\nwoman told her, and at last arrived at the Well of the World’s End.\nBut when she dipped the sieve in the cold, cold water, it all ran out\nagain. She tried and she tried again, but every time it was the same;\nand at last she sate down and cried as if her heart would break.",
        "Suddenly she heard a croaking voice, and she looked up and saw a great\nfrog with goggle eyes looking at her and speaking to her.",
        "“What’s the matter, dearie?” it said.",
        "“Oh, dear, oh dear,” she said, “my stepmother has sent me all this\nlong way to fill this sieve with water from the Well of the World’s\nEnd, and I can’t fill it no how at all.”",
        "“Well,” said the frog, “if you promise me to do whatever I bid you for\na whole night long, I’ll tell you how to fill it.”",
        "So the girl agreed, and then the frog said:",
        "  “Stop it with moss and daub it with clay,\n  And then it will carry the water away;”",
        "and then it gave a hop, skip and jump, and went flop into the Well of\nthe World’s End.",
        "So the girl looked about for some moss, and lined the bottom of the\nsieve with it, and over that she put some clay, and then she dipped it\nonce again into the Well of the World’s End; and this time, the water\ndidn’t run out, and she turned to go away.",
        "Just then the frog popped up its head out of the Well of the World’s\nEnd, and said: “Remember your promise.”",
        "“All right,” said the girl; for thought she, “what harm can a frog do\nme?”",
        "So she went back to her stepmother, and brought the sieve full of\nwater from the Well of the World’s End. The stepmother was fine and\nangry, but she said nothing at all.",
        "That very evening they heard something tap tapping at the door low\ndown, and a voice cried out:",
        "  “Open the door, my hinny, my heart,\n  Open the door, my own darling;\n  Mind you the words that you and I spoke,\n  Down in the meadow, at the World’s End Well.”",
        "“Whatever can that be?” cried out the stepmother, and the girl had to\ntell her all about it, and what she had promised the frog.",
        "“Girls must keep their promises,” said the stepmother. “Go and open\nthe door this instant.” For she was glad the girl would have to obey a\nnasty frog.",
        "So the girl went and opened the door, and there was the frog from the\nWell of the World’s End. And it hopped, and it skipped, and it jumped,\ntill it reached the girl, and then it said:",
        "  “Lift me to your knee, my hinny, my heart;\n  Lift me to your knee, my own darling;\n  Remember the words you and I spoke,\n  Down in the meadow by the World’s End Well.”",
        "But the girl didn’t like to, till her stepmother said “Lift it up this\ninstant, you hussy! Girls must keep their promises!”",
        "So at last she lifted the frog up on to her lap, and it lay there for\na time, till at last it said:",
        "  “Give me some supper, my hinny, my heart,\n  Give me some supper, my darling;\n  Remember the words you and I spake,\n  In the meadow, by the Well of the World’s End.”",
        "Well, she didn’t mind doing that, so she got it a bowl of milk and\nbread, and fed it well. And when the frog, had finished, it said:",
        "  “Go with me to bed, my hinny, my heart,\n  Go with me to bed, my own darling;\n  Mind you the words you spake to me,\n  Down by the cold well, so weary.”",
        "But that the girl wouldn’t do, till her stepmother said: “Do what you\npromised, girl; girls must keep their promises. Do what you’re bid, or\nout you go, you and your froggie.”",
        "So the girl took the frog with her to bed, and kept it as far away\nfrom her as she could. Well, just as the day was beginning to break\nwhat should the frog say but:",
        "  “Chop off my head, my hinny, my heart,\n  Chop off my head, my own darling;\n  Remember the promise you made to me,\n  Down by the cold well so weary.”",
        "At first the girl wouldn’t, for she thought of what the frog had done\nfor her at the Well of the World’s End. But when the frog said the\nwords over again, she went and took an axe and chopped off its head,\nand lo! and behold, there stood before her a handsome young prince,\nwho told her that he had been enchanted by a wicked magician, and he\ncould never be unspelled till some girl would do his bidding for a\nwhole night, and chop off his head at the end of it.",
        "The stepmother was that surprised when she found the young prince\ninstead of the nasty frog, and she wasn’t best pleased, you may be\nsure, when the prince told her that he was going to marry her\nstepdaughter because she had unspelled him. So they were married and\nwent away to live in the castle of the king, his father, and all the\nstepmother had to console her was, that it was all through her that\nher stepdaughter was married to a prince.",
        "A girl once went to the fair to hire herself for servant. At last a\nfunny-looking old gentleman engaged her, and took her home to his\nhouse. When she got there, he told her that he had something to teach\nher, for that in his house he had his own names for things.",
        "He said to her: “What will you call me?”",
        "“Master or mister, or whatever you please sir,” says she.",
        "He said: “You must call me ’master of all masters.’ And what would you\ncall this?” pointing to his bed.",
        "“Bed or couch, or whatever you please, sir.”",
        "“No, that’s my ’barnacle.’ And what do you call these?” said he\npointing to his pantaloons.",

        "“Fire or flame, or whatever you please, sir.”",
        "“You must call it ’hot cockalorum,’ and what this?” he went on,\npointing to the water.",
        "“Water or wet, or whatever you please, sir.”",
        "“No, ’pondalorum’ is its name. And what do you call all this?” asked\nhe, as he pointed to the house.",
        "“House or cottage, or whatever you please, sir.”",
        "“You must call it ’high topper mountain.’”",
        "That very night the servant woke her master up in a fright and said:\n\"Master of all masters, get out of your barnacle and put on your\nsquibs and crackers. For white-faced simminy has got a spark of hot\ncockalorum on its tail, and unless you get some pondalorum high topper\nmountain will be all on hot cockalorum.” .... That’s all.",
        "Long before Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, there reigned\nin the eastern part of England a king who kept his Court at\nColchester. In the midst of all his glory, his queen died, leaving\nbehind her an only daughter, about fifteen years of age, who for her\nbeauty and kindness was the wonder of all that knew her. But the king\nhearing of a lady who had likewise an only daughter, had a mind to\nmarry her for the sake of her riches, though she was old, ugly, hook-\nnosed, and hump-backed. Her daughter was a yellow dowdy, full of envy\nand ill-nature; and, in short, was much of the same mould as her\nmother. But in a few weeks the king, attended by the nobility and\ngentry, brought his deformed bride to the palace, where the marriage\nrites were performed. They had not been long in the Court before they\nset the king against his own beautiful daughter by false reports. The\nyoung princess having lost her father’s love, grew weary of the Court,\nand one day, meeting with her father in the garden, she begged him,\nwith tears in her eyes, to let her go and seek her fortune; to which\nthe king consented, and ordered her mother-in-law to give her what she\npleased. She went to the queen, who gave her a canvas bag of brown\nbread and hard cheese, with a bottle of beer; though this was but a\npitiful dowry for a king’s daughter. She took it, with thanks, and\nproceeded on her journey, passing through groves, woods, and valleys,\ntill at length she saw an old man sitting on a stone at the mouth of a\ncave, who said: “Good morrow, fair maiden, whither away so fast?”",
        "“Aged father,” says she, “I am going to seek my fortune.”",
        "“What have you got in your bag and bottle?”",
        "“In my bag I have got bread and cheese, and in my bottle good small\nbeer. Would you like to have some?”",
        "“Yes,” said he, “with all my heart.”",
        "With that the lady pulled out her provisions, and bade him eat and\nwelcome. He did so, and gave her many thanks, and said: “There is a\nthick thorny hedge before you, which you cannot get through, but take\nthis wand in your hand, strike it three times, and say, ’Pray, hedge,\nlet me come through,’ and it will open immediately; then, a little\nfurther, you will find a well; sit down on the brink of it, and there\nwill come up three golden heads, which will speak; and whatever they\nrequire, that do.” Promising she would, she took her leave of him.\nComing to the hedge and using the old man’s wand, it divided, and let\nher through; then, coming to the well, she had no sooner sat down than\na golden head came up singing:",
        "  “Wash me, and comb me,\n  And lay me down softly.\n  And lay me on a bank to dry,\n  That I may look pretty,\n  When somebody passes by.”",
        "“Yes,” said she, and taking it in her lap combed it with a silver\ncomb, and then placed it upon a primrose bank. Then up came a second\nand a third head, saying the same as the former. So she did the same\nfor them, and then, pulling out her provisions, sat down to eat her\ndinner.",
        "Then said the heads one to another: “What shall we weird for this\ndamsel who has used us so kindly?”",
        "The first said: “I weird her to be so beautiful that she shall charm\nthe most powerful prince in the world.”",
        "The second said: “I weird her such a sweet voice as shall far exceed\nthe nightingale.”",
        "The third said: “My gift shall be none of the least, as she is a\nking’s daughter, I’ll weird her so fortunate that she shall become\nqueen to the greatest prince that reigns.”",
        "She then let them down into the well again, and so went on her\njourney. She had not travelled long before she saw a king hunting in\nthe park with his nobles. She would have avoided him, but the king,\nhaving caught a sight of her, approached, and what with her beauty and\nsweet voice, fell desperately in love with her, and soon induced her\nto marry him.",
        "This king finding that she was the King of Colchester’s daughter,\nordered some chariots to be got ready, that he might pay the king, his\nfather-in-law, a visit. The chariot in which the king and queen rode\nwas adorned with rich gems of gold. The king, her father, was at first\nastonished that his daughter had been so fortunate, till the young\nking let him know of all that had happened. Great was the joy at Court\namongst all, with the exception of the queen and her club-footed\ndaughter, who were ready to burst with envy. The rejoicings, with\nfeasting and dancing, continued many days. Then at length they\nreturned home with the dowry her father gave her.",
        "The hump-backed princess, perceiving that her sister had been so lucky\nin seeking her fortune, wanted to do the same; so she told her mother,\nand all preparations were made, and she was furnished with rich\ndresses, and with sugar, almonds, and sweetmeats, in great quantities,\nand a large bottle of Malaga sack. With these she went the same road\nas her sister; and coming near the cave, the old man said: “Young\nwoman, whither so fast?”",
        "“What’s that to you?” said she.",
        "“Then,” said he, “what have you in your bag and bottle?”",
        "She answered: “Good things, which you shall not be troubled with.”",
        "“Won’t you give me some?” said he.",
        "“No, not a bit, nor a drop, unless it would choke you.”",
        "The old man frowned, saying: “Evil fortune attend ye!”",
        "Going on, she came to the hedge, through which she espied a gap, and\nthought to pass through it; but the hedge closed, and the, thorns ran\ninto her flesh, so that it was with great difficulty that she got\nthrough. Being now all over blood, she searched for water to wash\nherself, and, looking round, she saw the well. She sat down on the\nbrink of it, and one of the heads came up, saying: “Wash me, comb me,\nand lay me down softly,” as before, but she banged it with her bottle,\nsaying, “Take that for your washing.” So the second and third heads\ncame up, and met with no better treatment than the first. Whereupon\nthe heads consulted among themselves what evils to plague her with for\nsuch usage.",
        "The first said: “Let her be struck with leprosy in her face.”",
        "The second: “Let her voice be as harsh as a corn-crake’s.”",
        "The third said: “Let her have for husband but a poor country cobbler.”",
        "Well, she goes on till she came to a town, and it being market-day,\nthe people looked at her, and, seeing such a mangy face, and hearing\nsuch a squeaky voice, all fled but a poor country cobbler. Now he not\nlong before had mended the shoes of an old hermit, who, having no\nmoney gave him a box of ointment for the cure of the leprosy, and a\nbottle of spirits for a harsh voice. So the cobbler having a mind to\ndo an act of charity, was induced to go up to her and ask her who she\nwas.",
        "“I am,” said she, “the King of Colchester’s daughter-in-law.”",
        "“Well,” said the cobbler, “if I restore you to your natural\ncomplexion, and make a sound cure both in face and voice, will you in\nreward take me for a husband?”",
        "“Yes, friend,” replied she, “with all my heart!”",
        "With this the cobbler applied the remedies, and they made her well in\na few weeks; after which they were married, and so set forward for the\nCourt at Colchester. When the queen found that her daughter had\nmarried nothing but a poor cobbler, she hanged herself in wrath. The\ndeath of the queen so pleased the king, who was glad to get rid of her\nso soon, that he gave the cobbler a hundred pounds to quit the Court\nwith his lady, and take to a remote part of the kingdom, where he\nlived many years mending shoes, his wife spinning the thread for him.",

No one is likely to contend with\nProf. Müller and Sir George Cox, that we have here the detritus of\narchaic Aryan mythology, a parody of a sun-myth. There is little that\nis savage and archaic to attract the school of Dr. Tylor, beyond the\nspeaking powers of animals and inanimates. Yet even Mr. Lang is not\nlikely to hold that these variants arose by coincidence and\nindependently in the various parts of the world where they have been\nfound. The only solution is that the curious succession of incidents\nwas invented once for all at some definite place and time by some\ndefinite entertainer for children, and spread thence through all the\nOld World. In a few instances we can actually trace the passage-\ne.g., the Shetland version was certainly brought over from\nHamburg. Whether the centre of dispersion was India or not, it is\nimpossible to say, as it might have spread east from Smyrna (Hahn, No.\n56). Benfey (Einleitung zu Pantschatantra, i. 190-91) suggests\nthat this class of accumulative story may be a sort of parody on the\nIndian stories, illustrating the moral, “what great events from small\noccasions rise.” Thus, a drop of honey falls on the ground; a fly goes\nafter it, a bird snaps at the fly, a dog goes for the bird, another\ndog goes for the first, the masters of the two dogs–who happen to be\nkings–quarrel and go to war, whole provinces are devastated, and all\nfor a drop of honey! “Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse” also ends in a\nuniversal calamity which seems to arise from a cause of no great\nimportance. Benfey’s suggestion is certainly ingenious, but perhaps\ntoo ingenious to be true.",

In Southey’s version\nthere is nothing of Little Silverhair as the heroine: she seems to\nhave been introduced in a metrical version by G. N., much be-praised\nby Southey. Silverhair seems to have become a favourite, and in Mrs.\nValentine’s version of “The Three Bears,” in “The Old, Old Fairy\nTales,” the visit to the bear-house is only the preliminary to a long\nsuccession of adventures of the pretty little girl, of which there is\nno trace in the original (and this in “The Old, Old Fairy Tales.” Oh!\nMrs. Valentine!).

        "Parallels.–The chap-book of “Jack the Giant-Killer” is a\ncurious jumble. The second part, as in most chap-books, is a weak and\nlate invention of the enemy, and is not volkstümlich at all.\nThe first part is compounded of a comic and a serious theme. The first\nis that of the Valiant Tailor (Grimm, No. 20); to this belong the\nincidents of the fleabite blows (for variants of which see Köhler in\nJahrb. rom. eng. Phil., viii. 252), and that of the slit paunch\n(cf. Cosquin, l.c., ii. 51). The Thankful Dead episode,\nwhere the hero is assisted by the soul of a person whom he has caused\nto be buried, is found as early as the Cento novelle antiche\nand Straparola, xi. 2. It has been best studied by Köhler in\nGermania, iii. 199-209 (cf. Cosquin, i. 214-5; ii. 14 and note;\nand Crane, Ital. Pop. Tales, 350, note 12). It occurs also in the\ncurious play of Peele’s The Old Wives’ Tale, in which one of the\ncharacters is the Ghost of Jack. Practically the same story as this part\nof Jack the Giant-Killer occurs in Kennedy, Fictions of the Irish Celts,\np. 32, “Jack the Master and Jack the Servant;” and Kennedy adds (p. 38),\n\"In some versions Jack the Servant is the spirit of the buried man.”",
        "The “Fee-fi-fo-fum” formula is common to all English stories of giants\nand ogres; it also occurs in Peele’s play and in King Lear (see\nnote on “Childe Rowland”). Messrs.

        "Source.–Jamieson’s Illustrations of Northern\nAntiquities, 1814, p. 397 seq., who gives it as told by a\ntailor in his youth, c. 1770. I have Anglicised the Scotticisms,\neliminated an unnecessary ox-herd and swine-herd, who lose their\nheads for directing the Childe, and I have called the Erlkönig’s lair the\n Dark Tower on the strength of the description and of Shakespeare’s\nreference. I have likewise suggested a reason why Burd Ellen fell into\nhis power, chiefly in order to introduce a definition of “widershins.\"\n\"All the rest is the original horse,” even including the erroneous\ndescription of the youngest son as the Childe or heir (cf. “Childe\nHarold” and Childe Wynd, infra, No. xxxiii.), unless this is some\n\"survival” of Junior Right or “Borough English,” the archaic custom of\nletting the heirship pass to the youngest son. I should add that, on the\nstrength of the reference to Merlin, Jamieson calls Childe Rowland’s\nmother, Queen Guinevere, and introduces references to King Arthur\nand his Court. But as he confesses that these are his own improvements\non the tailor’s narrative I have eliminated them.",
        "Parallels.–The search for the Dark Tower is similar to that of\nthe Red Ettin, (cf. Köhler on Gonzenbach, ii. 222). The formula\n\"youngest best,” in which the youngest of three brothers succeeds\nafter the others have failed, is one of the most familiar in folk-\ntales amusingly parodied by Mr. Lang in his Prince Prigio. The\ntaboo against taking food in the underworld occurs in the myth of\nProserpine, and is also frequent in folk-tales (Child, i. 322). But\nthe folk-tale parallels to our tale fade into insignificance before\nits brilliant literary relationships. There can be little doubt that\nEdgar, in his mad scene in King Lear, is alluding to our tale\nwhen he breaks into the lines:",
        "“Childe Rowland to the Dark Tower came....” His word was still: “Fie,\nfoh and fum, I smell the blood of a British man.” King Lear,\nact iii. sc. 4, ad fin.",
        "[Footnote: “British” for “English.” This is one of the points that\nsettles the date of the play; James I. was declared King of Great\nBritain, October 1604. I may add that Motherwell in his\nMinstrelsy, p. xiv. note, testifies that the story was still\nextant in the nursery at the time he wrote (1828).]",
        "The latter reference is to the cry of the King of Elfland. That some\nsuch story was current in England in Shakespeare’s time, is proved by\nthat curious mélange of nursery tales, Peele’s The Old Wives’ Tale.\nThe main plot of this is the search of two brothers, Calypha and Thelea,\nfor a lost sister, Delia, who has been bespelled by a sorcerer, Sacrapant\n(the names are taken from the “Orlando Furioso”). They are instructed by\nan old man (like Merlin in “Childe Rowland”) how to rescue their sister,\nand ultimately succeed. The play has besides this the themes of the\nThankful Dead, the Three Heads of the Well (which see), the Life\nIndex, and a transformation, so that it is not to be wondered at if some\nof the traits of “Childe Rowland” are observed in it.",
        "But a still closer parallel is afforded by Milton’s Comus. Here\nagain we have two brothers in search of a sister, who has got into the\npower of an enchanter. But besides this, there is the refusal of the\nheroine to touch the enchanted food, just as Childe Rowland finally\nrefuses. And ultimately the bespelled heroine is liberated by a\nliquid, which is applied to her lips and finger-tips, just as\nChilde Rowland’s brothers are unspelled. Such a minute resemblance as\nthis cannot be accidental, and it is therefore probable that Milton\nused the original form of “Childe Rowland,” or some variant of it, as\nheard in his youth, and adapted it to the purposes of the masque at\nLudlow Castle, and of his allegory. Certainly no other folk-tale in\nthe world can claim so distinguished an offspring.",
        "Remarks.–Distinguished as “Childe Rowland” will be henceforth\nas the origin of Comus, if my affiliation be accepted, it has\neven more remarkable points of interest, both in form and matter, for\nthe folklorist, unless I am much mistaken. I will therefore touch upon\nthese points, reserving a more detailed examination for another\noccasion.",
        "First, as to the form of the narrative. This begins with verse, then\nturns to prose, and throughout drops again at intervals into poetry in\na friendly way like Mr. Wegg. Now this is a form of writing not\nunknown in other branches of literature, the cante-fable, of\nwhich “Aucassin et Nicolette” is the most distinguished example. Nor\nis the cante-fable confined to France. Many of the heroic\nverses of the Arabs contained in the Hamâsa would be unintelligible\nwithout accompanying narrative, which is nowadays preserved in the\ncommentary. The verses imbedded in the Arabian Nights give\nthem something of the character of a cante-fable, and the same\nmay be said of the Indian and Persian story-books, though the verse is\nusually of a sententious and moral kind, as in the gâthas of the\nBuddhist Jatakas. Even as remote as Zanzibar, Mr. Lang notes, the\nfolk-tales are told as cante-fables. There are even traces in the\nOld Testament of such screeds of verse amid the prose narrative, as\nin the story of Lamech or that of Balaam. All this suggests that this is a\nvery early and common form of narrative.",
        "Among folk-tales there are still many traces of the cante-\nfable. Thus, in Grimm’s collection, verses occur in Nos. 1, 5, 11,\n12, 13, 15, 19, 21, 24, 28, 30, 36, 38a, b, 39a, 40, 45, 46, 47,\nout of the first fifty tales, 36 per cent. Of Chambers’ twenty-one\nfolk-tales, in the Popular Rhymes of Scotland only five are\nwithout interspersed verses. Of the forty-three tales contained in this\nvolume, three (ix., xxix., xxxiii.) are derived from ballads and do not\ntherefore count in the present connection. Of the remaining forty, i.,\niii., vii., xvi., xix., xxi., xxiii., xxv., xxxi., xxxv., xxxviii., xli.\n(made up from verses), xliii., contain rhymed lines, while\nxiv., xxii., xxvi., and xxxvii., contain “survivals” of rhymes (\"let\nme come in–chinny chin-chin\"; “once again ... come to Spain;\"\n\"it is not so–should be so\"; “and his lady, him behind”); and x.\nand xxxii. are rhythmical if not rhyming. As most of the remainder\nare drolls, which have probably a different origin, there seems to\nbe great probability that originally all folk-tales of a serious character\nwere interspersed with rhyme, and took therefore the form of the\ncante-fable. It is indeed unlikely that the ballad itself began as\ncontinuous verse, and the cante-fable is probably the protoplasm\nout of which both ballad and folk-tale have been differentiated, the\nballad by omitting the narrative prose, the folk-tale by expanding it.\nIn “Childe Rowland” we have the nearest example to such protoplasm,\nand it is not difficult to see how it could have been shortened into\na ballad or reduced to a prose folk-tale pure and simple.",
        "The subject-matter of “Childe Rowland” has also claims on our\nattention especially with regard to recent views on the true nature\nand origin of elves, trolls, and fairies. I refer to the recently\npublished work of Mr. D. MacRitchie, “The Testimony of Tradition\"\n(Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co.)–i.e., of tradition about\nthe fairies and the rest. Briefly put, Mr. MacRitchie’s view is that\nthe elves, trolls, and fairies represented in popular tradition are\nreally the mound-dwellers, whose remains have been discovered in some\nabundance in the form of green hillocks, which have been artificially\nraised over a long and low passage leading to a central chamber open\nto the sky. Mr. MacRitchie shows that in several instances traditions\nabout trolls or “good people” have attached themselves to mounds,\nwhich have afterwards on investigation turned out to be evidently the\nformer residence of men of smaller build than the mortals of to-day.\nHe goes on further to identify these with the Picts–fairies are\ncalled “Pechs” in Scotland–and other early races, but with these\nethnological equations we need not much concern ourselves. It is\notherwise with the mound-traditions and their relation, if not to\nfairy tales in general, to tales about fairies, trolls, elves,\netc. These are very few in number, and generally bear the character of\nanecdotes. The fairies, etc., steal a child, they help a wanderer to a\ndrink and then disappear into a green hill, they help cottagers with\ntheir work at night but disappear if their presence is noticed; human\nmidwives are asked to help fairy mothers, fairy maidens marry ordinary\nmen or girls marry and live with fairy husbands. All such things may\nhave happened and bear no such à priori marks of impossibility\nas speaking animals, flying through the air, and similar incidents of\nthe folk-tale pure and simple. If, as archaeologists tell us, there\nwas once a race of men in Northern Europe, very short and hairy, that\ndwelt in underground chambers artificially concealed by green\nhillocks, it does not seem unlikely that odd survivors of the race\nshould have lived on after they had been conquered and nearly\nexterminated by Aryan invaders and should occasionally have performed\nsomething like the pranks told of fairies and trolls.",
        "Certainly the description of the Dark Tower of the King of Elfland in\n\"Childe Rowland,” has a remarkable resemblance to the dwellings of the\n\"good folk,” which recent excavations have revealed. By the kindness\nof Mr. MacRitchie, I am enabled to give the reader illustrations of\none of the most interesting of these, the Maes-How of Orkney. This is\na green mound some 100 feet in length and 35 in breadth at its\nbroadest part. Tradition had long located a goblin in its centre, but\nit was not till 1861 that it was discovered to be pierced by a long\npassage 53 feet in length, and only two feet four inches high, for\nhalf of its length. This led into a central chamber 15 feet square and\nopen to the sky.",
        "Now it is remarkable how accurately all this corresponds to the Dark\nTower of “Childe Rowland,” allowing for a little idealisation on the\npart of the narrator. We have the long dark passage leading into the\nwell-lit central chamber, and all enclosed in a green hill or mound.\nIt is of course curious to contrast Mr. Batten’s frontispiece with the\ncentral chamber of the How, but the essential features are the same.\nEven such a minute touch as the terraces on the hill have their\nbearing, I believe, on Mr. MacRitchie’s “realistic” views of Faerie.\nFor in quite another connection Mr. G. L. Gomme, in his recent\n\"Village Community” (W. Scott), pp. 75-98, has given reasons and\nexamples for believing that terrace cultivation along the sides of\nhills was a practice of the non-Aryan and pre-Aryan inhabitants of\nthese isles. [Footnote: To these may be added Iona (cf. Duke of\nArgyll, Iona, p. 109).] Here then from a quarter quite unexpected\nby Mr. MacRitchie, we have evidence of the association of the King\nof Elfland with a non-Aryan mode of cultivation of the soil. By Mr.\nGomme’s kindness I am enabled to give an illustration of this.",
        "Altogether it seems not improbable that in such a tale as “Childe\nRowland” we have an idealised picture of a “marriage by capture” of\none of the diminutive non-Aryan dwellers of the green hills with an\nAryan maiden, and her re-capture by her brothers. It is otherwise\ndifficult to account for such a circumstantial description of the\ninterior of these mounds, and especially of such a detail as the\nterrace cultivation on them. At the same time it must not be thought\nthat Mr. MacRitchie’s views explain all fairy tales, or that his\nidentifications of Finns = Fenians = Fairies = Sidhe = “Pechs” = Picts,\nwill necessarily be accepted. His interesting book, so far as it goes,\nseems to throw light on tales about mermaids (Finnish women in their\n\"kayaks,”) and trolls, but not necessarily, on fairy tales in general.\nThus, in the present volume, besides “Childe Rowland,” there is only\n\"Tom Tit Tot” in his hollow, the green hill in “Kate Crackernuts,” the\n\"Cauld Lad of Hilton,” and perhaps the “Fairy Ointment,” that are\naffected by his views.",
        "Finally, there are a couple of words in the narrative that deserve a\ncouple of words of explanation: “Widershins” is probably, as Mr.\nBatten suggests, analogous to the German “wider Schein,” against the\nappearance of the sun, “counter-clockwise” as the mathematicians say–\ni.e., W., S., E., N., instead of with the sun and the hands of\na clock; why it should have an unspelling influence is hard to say.\n\"Bogle” is a provincial word for “spectre,” and is analogous to the\nWelsh bwg, “goblin,” and to the English insect of similar name,\nand still more curiously to the Russian “Bog,” God, after which so\nmany Russian rivers are named. I may add that “Burd” is etymologically\nthe same as “bride” and is frequently used in the early romances for\n\"Lady.”",

The latter part wanders off into “rob giant of\nthree things,” a familiar incident in folk-tales (Cosquin, i. 46-7), and\nfinally winds up with the “out of sack” trick, for which see Cosquin, i.\n113; ii. 209; and Köhler on Campbell, in Occident and Orient,\nii. 489-506.",

        "Parallels.–Halliwell has also a version entirely in verse.\n\"Tom Thumb” is “Le petit Poucet” of the French, “Daumling” of the\nGermans, and similar diminutive heroes elsewhere (cf. Deulin,\nContes de ma Mère l’Oye, 326), but of his adventures only that\nin the cow’s stomach (cf. Cosquin, ii. 190) is common with his\nFrench and German cousins. M. Gaston Paris has a monograph on “Tom\nThumb.”",
        "Source.–Contributed by Blakeway to Malone’s Variorum\nShakespeare, to illustrate Benedick’s remark in Much Ado about\nNothing (I. i. 146): “Like the old tale, my Lord, ’It is not so,\nnor ’twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be so;’” which\nclearly refers to the tale of Mr. Fox. “The Forbidden Chamber” has\nbeen studied by Mr. Hartland, Folk-Lore Journal, iii. 193,\nseq.",
        "Parallels.–Halliwell, p. 166, gives a similar tale of “An\nOxford Student,” whose sweetheart saw him digging her grave. “Mr. Fox\"\nis clearly a variant of the theme of “The Robber Bridegroom” (Grimm,\nNo. 40, Mrs. Hunt’s translation, i. 389, 395; and Cosquin, i. 180-1).",
        "Source.–Halliwell, 157.",
        "Parallels.–The same story occurs in Lowland Scotch as “Jock\nand his Mother,” Chambers, l.c., 101; in Ireland, as “I’ll be\nwiser next time,” Kennedy, l.c., 39-42. Abroad it is Grimm’s\nHans im Glück (No. 83). The “cure by laughing” incident is\n\"common form” in folk-tales (cf. Köhler on Gonzenbach,  Sizil.\nMärchen, ii. 210, 224; Jones and Kropf, Magyar Tales, 312).",
        "Source.–American Journal of Folk-Lore, ii. 60.",
        "Parallels.–Another variant is given in the same\nJournal, p. 277, where reference is also made to a version “The\nGingerbread Boy,” in St. Nicholas, May 1875. Chambers gives two\nversions of the same story, under the title “The Wee Bunnock,” the\nfirst of which is one of the most dramatic and humorous of folk-tales.\nUnfortunately, the Scotticisms are so frequent as to render the droll\npractically untranslatable. “The Fate of Mr. Jack Sparrow” in Uncle\nRemus is similar to that of Johnny-Cake.",
        "Source.–From the ballad of the same name as given in Mr.\nAllingham’s Ballad Book: it is clearly a fairy tale and not a\nballad proper.",
        "Parallels.–The lover visiting his spouse in guise of a bird,\nis a frequent motif in folk-tales.",
        "Source.–From memory of Mrs. B. Abrahams, who heard it from her\nmother some x years ago (more than 40). I have transposed the\ntwo incidents, as in her version Tommy Grimes was a clever carver and\ncarried about with him a carven leg. This seemed to me to exceed the\nlimits of vraisemblance even for a folk-tale.",
        "Parallels.–Getting out of an ogre’s clutches by playing on the\nsimplicity of his wife, occurs in “Molly Whuppie” (No. xxii.), and its\nsimilars. In the Grimms’ “Hansel and Grethel,” Hansel pokes out a\nstick instead of his finger that the witch may not think him fat\nenough for the table.",
        "Remarks.–Mr. Miacca seems to have played the double\nrôle of a domestic Providence. He not alone punished bad boys,\nas here, but also rewarded the good, by leaving them gifts on\nappropriate occasions like Santa Claus or Father Christmas, who, as is\nwell known, only leave things for good children. Mrs. Abrahams\nremembers one occasion well when she nearly caught sight of Mr.\nMiacca, just after he had left her a gift; she saw his shadow in the\nshape of a bright light passing down the garden.",
        "Source.–I have cobbled this up out of three chap-book\nversions; (1) that contained in Mr. Hartland’s English Folk-\ntales; (2) that edited by Mr. H. B. Wheatley for the Villon\nSociety; (3) that appended to Messrs. Besant and Rice’s monograph.",
        "Parallels.–Whittington’s cat has made the fortune of his\nmaster in all parts of the Old World, as Mr. W. A. Clouston, among\nothers, has shown, Popular Tales and Fictions, ii. 65-78\n(cf. Köhler on Gonzenbach, ii. 251).",
        "Remarks.–If Bow Bells had pealed in the exact and accurate\nnineteenth century, they doubtless would have chimed",
        "  Turn again, Whittington,\n  Thrice and a half Lord Mayor of London.",
        "For besides his three mayoralties of 1397, 1406, and 1419, he served\nas Lord Mayor in place of Adam Bamme, deceased, in the latter half of\nthe mayoralty of 1396. It will be noticed that the chap-book puts the\nintroduction of potatoes rather far back.",
        "Source.–From Chambers, l.c., 64, much Anglicised. I\nhave retained “Aih-late-wee-moul,” though I candidly confess I have\nnot the slightest idea what it means; judging other children by\nmyself, I do not think that makes the response less effective. The\nprosaic-minded may substitute “Up-late-and-little-food.”",
        "Parallels.–The man made by instalments, occurs in the Grimms’\nNo. 4, and something like it in an English folk-tale, The Golden\nBall, ap. Henderson, l.c., p. 333.",
        "Source.–From an eighteenth-century ballad of the Rev. Mr. Lamb\nof Norham, as given in Prof. Child’s Ballads; with a few\ntouches and verses from the more ancient version “Kempion.” A florid\nprose version appeared in Monthly Chronicle of North Country\nLore for May 1890. I have made the obvious emendation of",
        "O quit your sword, unbend your bow",
        "for",
        "O quit your sword, and bend your bow.",
        "Parallels.–The ballad of “Kempe Owein” is a more general\nversion which “The Laidly Worm” has localised near Bamborough. We\nlearn from this that the original hero was Kempe or Champion Owain,\nthe Welsh hero who flourished in the ninth century. Childe Wynd\ntherefore = Childe Owein. The “Deliverance Kiss” has been studied by\nProf. Child, l.c., i. 207. A noteworthy example occurs in\nBoiardo’s Orlando Inamorato, cc. xxv., xxvi.",
        "Remarks.–It is perhaps unnecessary to give the equations\n\"Laidly Worm = Loathly Worm = Loathsome Dragon,” and “borrowed =\nchanged.”",
        "Source.–Halliwell, p. 154.",
        "Parallels.–Scarcely more than a variant of the “Old Woman and\nher Pig” (No. iv.), which see. It is curious that a very similar “run\"\nis added by Bengali women at the end of every folk-tale they tell (Lal\nBehari Day, Folk Tales of Bengal, Pref. ad fin.)",
        "Source.–Henderson, l.c., p. 326, from a communication\nby the Rev. S. Baring-Gould.",
        "Parallels.–\"Jonah rings” have been put together by Mr.\nClouston in his Popular Tales, i. 398, &c.: the most famous are\nthose of Polycrates, of Solomon, and the Sanskrit drama of\n\"Sakuntala,” the plot of which turns upon such a ring. “Letters to\nkill bearer” have been traced from Homer downwards by Prof. Köhler on\nGonzenbach, ii. 220, and “the substituted letter” by the same\nauthority in Occ. u. Or., ii. 289. Mr. Baring-Gould, who was\none of the pioneers of the study of folk-tales in this country, has\ngiven a large number of instances of “the pre-ordained marriage” in\nfolk-tales in Henderson, l.c.",
        "Source.–I have built up the “Magpie’s Nest” from two\nnidification myths, as a German professor would call them, in the Rev.\nMr. Swainson’s Folk-Lore of British Birds, pp. 80 and 166. I\nhave received instruction about the relative values of nests from a\nlittle friend of mine named Katie, who knows all about it. If there is\nany mistake in the order of neatness in the various birds’ nests, I\nmust have learnt my lesson badly.",
        "Remarks.–English popular tradition is curiously at variance\nabout the magpie’s nidificatory powers, for another legend given by\nMr. Swainson represents her as refusing to be instructed by the birds\nand that is why she does not make a good nest.",
        "Source.–Given by Mr. Lang in Longman’s Magazine, vol.\nxiv. and reprinted in Folk-Lore, Sept. 1890. It is very\ncorrupt, both girls being called Kate, and I have had largely to\nrewrite.",
        "Parallels.–There is a tale which is clearly a cousin if not a\nparent of this in Kennedy’s Fictions, 54 seq., containing the\nvisit to the green hill (for which see “Childe Rowland”), a reference to\nnuts, and even the sesame rhyme. The prince is here a corpse who\nbecomes revivified; the same story is in Campbell No. 13. The jealous\nstepmother is “universally human.” (Cf. Köhler on Gonzenbach, ii. 206.)",
        "Source.–Henderson’s Folk-Lore of Northern Counties, 2nd\nedition, published by the Folk-Lore Society, pp. 266-7. I have written\nthe introductory paragraph so as to convey some information about\nBrownies, Bogles, and Redcaps, for which Henderson, l.c., 246-\n53, is my authority. Mr. Batten’s portrait renders this somewhat\nsuperfluous.",
        "Parallels.–The Grimms’ “Elves” (No. 39) behave in like manner\non being rewarded for their services. Milton’s “lubbar-fiend” in\nL’Allegro has all the characteristics of a Brownie.",
        "Source.–Henderson, l.c., first edition, pp. 327-9, by\nthe Rev. S. Baring-Gould.",
        "Parallels.–Mr. Baring-Gould gives another version from the\nEast Riding, l.c., 329, in which there are three brothers who\ngo through the adventures. He also refers to European Variants, p.\n311, which could now be largely supplemented from Cosquin, i. 53-4,\nii. 66, 171.",
        "Remarks.–As an example of the sun-myth explanation of folk-\ntales I will quote the same authority (p. 314): “The Master, who gives\nthe three precious gifts, is the All Father, the Supreme Spirit. The\ngold and jewel-dropping ass, is the spring cloud, hanging in the sky\nand shedding the bright productive vernal showers. The table which\ncovers itself is the earth becoming covered with flowers and fruit at\nthe bidding of the New Year. But there is a check; rain is withheld,\nthe process of vegetation is stayed by some evil influence. Then comes\nthe thunder-cloud, out of which leaps the bolt; the rains pour down,\nthe earth receives them, and is covered with abundance–all that was\nlost is recovered.”",
        "Mr. Baring-Gould, it is well-known, has since become a distinguished\nwriter of fiction.",
        "Source.–Mrs. Bray, The Tamar and the Tavy, i. 174\n(letters to Southey), as quoted by Mr. Hartland in Folk-Lore,\ni. 207-8. I have christened the anonymous midwife and euphemised her\nprofession.",
        "Parallels.–Mr. Hartland has studied Human Midwives in the\nArchaeol. Review, iv., and parallels to our story in Folk-\nLore, i. 209, seq.; the most interesting of these is from\nGervase of Tilbury (xiii. cent.), Otia Imper., iii. 85, and\nthree Breton tales given by M. Sebillot (Contes, ii. 42;\nLitt. orale, 23; Trad. et Superst., i. 109). Cf. Prof. Child, i.\n339; ii. 505.",
        "Source.–Leyden’s edition of The Complaynt of Scotland,\np. 234 seq., with additional touches from Halliwell, 162-3, who\nmakes up a slightly different version from the rhymes. The opening\nformula I have taken from Mayhew, London Labour, iii. 390, who\ngives it as the usual one when tramps tell folk-tales. I also added it\nto No. xvii.",
        "Parallels.–Sir W. Scott remembered a similar story; see\nTaylor’s Gammer Grethel, ad fin. In Scotland it is Chambers’s\ntale of The Paddo, p. 87; Leyden supposes it is referred to in\nthe Complaynt, (c. 1548), as “The Wolf of the Warldis End.” The\nwell of this name occurs also in the Scotch version of the “Three\nHeads of the Well,” (No. xliii.). Abroad it is the Grimms’ first tale,\nwhile frogs who would a-wooing go are discussed by Prof. Köhler,\nOcc. u. Orient ii. 330; by Prof. Child, i. 298; and by Messrs.\nJones and Kropf, l.c., p. 404. The sieve-bucket task is\nwidespread from the Danaids of the Greeks to the leverets of Uncle\nRemus, who, curiously enough, use the same rhyme: “Fill it wid\nmoss en dob it wid clay.” Cf., too, No. xxiii.",
        "Source.–I have taken what suited me from a number of sources,\nwhich shows how wide-spread this quaint droll is in England: (i) In\nMayhew, London Poor, iii. 391, told by a lad in a workhouse;\n(ii) several versions in 7 Notes and Queries, iii. 35, 87, 159,\n398.",
        "Parallels.–Rev. W. Gregor gives a Scotch version under the\ntitle “The Clever Apprentice,” in Folk-Lore Journal, vii. 166.\nMr. Hartland, in Notes and Queries, l.c., 87, refers to\nPitré’s Fiabi sicil., iii. 120, for a variant.",
        "Remarks.–According to Mr. Hartland, the story is designed as a\nsatire on pedantry, and is as old in Italy as Straparola (sixteenth\ncentury). In passionate Sicily a wife disgusted with her husband’s\npedantry sets the house on fire, and informs her husband of the fact\nin this unintelligible gibberish; he, not understanding his own lingo,\nfalls a victim to the flames, and she marries the servant who had\ntaken the message.",
        "Source.–Halliwell, p. 158. The second wish has been somewhat\neuphemised.",
        "Parallels.–The story forms part of Peele’s Old Wives’\nTale, where the rhyme was",
        "  A Head rises in the well,\n  Fair maiden, white and red,\n  Stroke me smooth and comb my head,\n  And thou shalt have some cockell-bread.",
        "It is also in Chambers, l.c., 105, where the well is at the\nWorld’s End (cf. No. xli.). The contrasted fates of two step-\nsisters, is the Frau Holle (Grimm, No. 24) type of Folk-tale studied\nby Cosquin, i. 250, seq. “Kate Crackernuts” (No. xxxvii.) is a\npleasant contrast to this.",
