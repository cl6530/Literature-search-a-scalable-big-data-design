        "That morning Mme. de Nucingen had driven Eugene to despair. In his own\nmind he had completely surrendered himself to Vautrin, and\ndeliberately shut his eyes to the motive for the friendship which that\nextraordinary man professed for him, nor would he look to the\nconsequences of such an alliance. Nothing short of a miracle could\nextricate him now out of the gulf into which he had walked an hour\nago, when he exchanged vows in the softest whispers with Mlle.\nTaillefer. To Victorine it seemed as if she heard an angel’s voice,\nthat heaven was opening above her; the Maison Vauquer took strange and\nwonderful hues, like a stage fairy-palace. She loved and she was\nloved; at any rate, she believed that she was loved; and what woman\nwould not likewise have believed after seeing Rastignac’s face and\nlistening to the tones of his voice during that hour snatched under\nthe Argus eyes of the Maison Vauquer? He had trampled on his\nconscience; he knew that he was doing wrong, and did it deliberately;\nhe had said to himself that a woman’s happiness should atone for this\nvenial sin. The energy of desperation had lent new beauty to his face;\nthe lurid fire that burned in his heart shone from his eyes. Luckily\nfor him, the miracle took place. Vautrin came in in high spirits, and\nat once read the hearts of these two young creatures whom he had\nbrought together by the combinations of his infernal genius, but his\ndeep voice broke in upon their bliss.",
        "     “A charming girl is my Fanchette\n      In her simplicity,”",
        "he sang mockingly.",
        "Victorine fled. Her heart was more full than it had ever been, but it\nwas full of joy, and not of sorrow. Poor child! A pressure of the\nhand, the light touch of Rastignac’s hair against her cheek, a word\nwhispered in her ear so closely that she felt the student’s warm\nbreath on her, the pressure of a trembling arm about her waist, a kiss\nupon her throat–such had been her betrothal. The near neighborhood of\nthe stout Sylvie, who might invade that glorified room at any moment,\nonly made these first tokens of love more ardent, more eloquent, more\nentrancing than the noblest deeds done for love’s sake in the most\nfamous romances. This plain-song of love, to use the pretty\nexpression of our forefathers, seemed almost criminal to the devout\nyoung girl who went to confession every fortnight. In that one hour\nshe had poured out more of the treasures of her soul than she could\ngive in later days of wealth and happiness, when her whole self\nfollowed the gift.",
        "“The thing is arranged,” Vautrin said to Eugene, who remained. “Our\ntwo dandies have fallen out. Everything was done in proper form. It is\na matter of opinion. Our pigeon has insulted my hawk. They will meet\nto-morrow in the redoubt at Clignancourt. By half-past eight in the\nmorning Mlle. Taillefer, calmly dipping her bread and butter in her\ncoffee cup, will be sole heiress of her father’s fortune and\naffections. A funny way of putting it, isn’t it? Taillefer’s youngster\nis an expert swordsman, and quite cocksure about it, but he will be\nbled; I have just invented a thrust for his benefit, a way of raising\nyour sword point and driving it at the forehead. I must show you that\nthrust; it is an uncommonly handy thing to know.”",
        "Rastignac heard him in dazed bewilderment; he could not find a word in\nreply. Just then Goriot came in, and Bianchon and a few of the\nboarders likewise appeared.",
        "“That is just as I intended.” Vautrin said. “You know quite well what\nyou are about. Good, my little eaglet! You are born to command, you\nare strong, you stand firm on your feet, you are game! I respect you.”",
        "He made as though he would take Eugene’s hand, but Rastignac hastily\nwithdrew it, sank into a chair, and turned ghastly pale; it seemed to\nhim that there was a sea of blood before his eyes.",
        "“Oh! so we still have a few dubious tatters of the swaddling clothes\nof virtue about us!” murmured Vautrin. “But Papa Doliban has three\nmillions; I know the amount of his fortune. Once have her dowry in\nyour hands, and your character will be as white as the bride’s white\ndress, even in your own eyes.”",
        "Rastignac hesitated no longer. He made up his mind that he would go\nthat evening to warn the Taillefers, father and son. But just as\nVautrin left him, Father Goriot came up and said in his ear, “You look\nmelancholy, my boy; I will cheer you up. Come with me.”",
        "The old vermicelli dealer lighted his dip at one of the lamps as he\nspoke. Eugene went with him, his curiosity had been aroused.",
        "“Let us go up to your room,” the worthy soul remarked, when he had\nasked Sylvie for the law student’s key. “This morning,” he resumed,\n“you thought that she did not care about you, did you not? Eh? She\nwould have nothing to say to you, and you went away out of humor and\nout of heart. Stuff and rubbish! She wanted you to go because she was\nexpecting me! Now do you understand? We were to complete the\narrangements for taking some chambers for you, a jewel of a place, you\nare to move into it in three days’ time. Don’t split upon me. She\nwants it to be a surprise; but I couldn’t bear to keep the secret from\nyou. You will be in the Rue d’Artois, only a step or two from the Rue\nSaint-Lazare, and you are to be housed like a prince! Any one might\nhave thought we were furnishing the house for a bride. Oh! we have\ndone a lot of things in the last month, and you knew nothing about it.\nMy attorney has appeared on the scene, and my daughter is to have\nthirty-six thousand francs a year, the interest on her money, and I\nshall insist on having her eight hundred thousand invested in sound\nsecurities, landed property that won’t run away.”",
        "Eugene was dumb. He folded his arms and paced up and down in his\ncheerless, untidy room. Father Goriot waited till the student’s back\nwas turned, and seized the opportunity to go to the chimney-piece and\nset upon it a little red morocco case with Rastignac’s arms stamped in\ngold on the leather.",
        "“My dear boy,” said the kind soul, “I have been up to the eyes in this\nbusiness. You see, there was plenty of selfishness on my part; I have\nan interested motive in helping you to change lodgings. You will not\nrefuse me if I ask you something; will you, eh?”",
        "“What is it?”",
        "“There is a room on the fifth floor, up above your rooms, that is to\nlet along with them; that is where I am going to live, isn’t that so?\nI am getting old: I am too far from my girls. I shall not be in the\nway, but I shall be there, that is all. You will come and talk to me\nabout her every evening. It will not put you about, will it? I shall\nhave gone to bed before you come in, but I shall hear you come up, and\nI shall say to myself, ’He has just seen my little Delphine. He has\nbeen to a dance with her, and she is happy, thanks to him.’ If I were\nill, it would do my heart good to hear you moving about below, to know\nwhen you leave the house and when you come in. It is only a step to\nthe Champs-Elysees, where they go every day, so I shall be sure of\nseeing them, whereas now I am sometimes too late. And then–perhaps\nshe may come to see you! I shall hear her, I shall see her in her soft\nquilted pelisse tripping about as daintily as a kitten. In this one\nmonth she has become my little girl again, so light-hearted and gay.\nHer soul is recovering, and her happiness is owing to you! Oh! I would\ndo impossibilities for you. Only just now she said to me, ’I am very\nhappy, papa!’ When they say ’father’ stiffly, it sends a chill through\nme; but when they call me ’papa,’ it brings all the old memories back.\nI feel most their father then; I even believe that they belong to me,\nand to no one else.”",
        "The good man wiped his eyes, he was crying.",
        "“It is a long while since I have heard them talk like that, a long,\nlong time since she took my arm as she did to-day. Yes, indeed, it\nmust be quite ten years since I walked side by side with one of my\ngirls. How pleasant it was to keep step with her, to feel the touch of\nher gown, the warmth of her arm! Well, I took Delphine everywhere this\nmorning; I went shopping with her, and I brought her home again. Oh!\nyou must let me live near you. You may want some one to do you a\nservice some of these days, and I shall be on the spot to do it. Oh!\nif only that great dolt of an Alsatian would die, if his gout would\nhave the sense to attack his stomach, how happy my poor child would\nbe! You would be my son-in-law; you would be her husband in the eyes\nof the world. Bah! she has known no happiness, that excuses\neverything. Our Father in heaven is surely on the side of fathers on\nearth who love their children. How fond of you she is!” he said,\nraising his head after a pause. “All the time we were going about\ntogether she chatted away about you. ’He is so nice-looking, papa;\nisn’t he? He is kind-hearted! Does he talk to you about me?’ Pshaw!\nshe said enough about you to fill whole volumes; between the Rue\nd’Artois and the Passage des Panoramas she poured her heart out into\nmine. I did not feel old once during that delightful morning; I felt\nas light as a feather. I told her how you had given the banknote to\nme; it moved my darling to tears. But what can this be on your\nchimney-piece?” said Father Goriot at last. Rastignac had showed no\nsign, and he was dying of impatience.",
        "Eugene stared at his neighbor in dumb and dazed bewilderment. He\nthought of Vautrin, of that duel to be fought to-morrow morning, and\nof this realization of his dearest hopes, and the violent contrast\nbetween the two sets of ideas gave him all the sensations of\nnightmare. He went to the chimney-piece, saw the little square case,\nopened it, and found a watch of Breguet’s make wrapped in paper, on\nwhich these words were written:",
        "  “I want you to think of me every hour, because . . .",
        "“Delphine.”",
        "That last word doubtless contained an allusion to some scene that\nhad taken place between them. Eugene felt touched. Inside the gold\nwatch-case his arms had been wrought in enamel. The chain, the key,\nthe workmanship and design of the trinket were all such as he had\nimagined, for he had long coveted such a possession. Father Goriot was\nradiant. Of course he had promised to tell his daughter every little\ndetail of the scene and of the effect produced upon Eugene by her\npresent; he shared in the pleasure and excitement of the young people,\nand seemed to be not the least happy of the three. He loved Rastignac\nalready for his own as well as for his daughter’s sake.",
        "“You must go and see her; she is expecting you this evening. That\ngreat lout of an Alsatian is going to have supper with his\nopera-dancer. Aha! he looked very foolish when my attorney let him know\nwhere he was. He says he idolizes my daughter, does he? He had better\nlet her alone, or I will kill him. To think that my Delphine is his\"\n–he heaved a sigh–\"it is enough to make me murder him, but it would\nnot be manslaughter to kill that animal; he is a pig with a calf’s\nbrains.–You will take me with you, will you not?”",
        "“Yes, dear Father Goriot; you know very well how fond I am of you––”",
        "“Yes, I do know very well. You are not ashamed of me, are you? Not\nyou! Let me embrace you,” and he flung his arms around the student’s\nneck.",
        "“You will make her very happy; promise me that you will! You will go\nto her this evening, will you not?”",
        "“Oh! yes. I must go out; I have some urgent business on hand.”",
        "“Can I be of any use?”",
        "“My word, yes! Will you go to old Taillefer’s while I go to Mme. de\nNucingen? Ask him to make an appointment with me some time this\nevening; it is a matter of life and death.”",
        "“Really, young man!” cried Father Goriot, with a change of\ncountenance; “are you really paying court to his daughter, as those\nsimpletons were saying down below? . . . Tonnerre de dieu! you have\nno notion what a tap a la Goriot is like, and if you are playing a\ndouble game, I shall put a stop to it by one blow of the fist. . . Oh!\nthe thing is impossible!”",
        "“I swear to you that I love but one woman in the world,” said the\nstudent. “I only knew it a moment ago.”",
        "“Oh! what happiness!” cried Goriot.",
        "“But young Taillefer has been called out; the duel comes off\nto-morrow morning, and I have heard it said that he may lose his life\nin it.”",
        "“But what business is it of yours?” said Goriot.",
        "“Why, I ought to tell him so, that he may prevent his son from putting\nin an appearance––”",
        "Just at that moment Vautrin’s voice broke in upon them; he was\nstanding at the threshold of his door and singing:",
        "     “Oh! Richard, oh my king!\n      All the world abandons thee!\n      Broum! broum! broum! broum! broum!",
        "      The same old story everywhere,\n      A roving heart and a . . . tra la la.”",
        "“Gentlemen!” shouted Christophe, “the soup is ready, and every one is\nwaiting for you.”",
        "“Here,” Vautrin called down to him, “come and take a bottle of my\nBordeaux.”",
        "“Do you think your watch is pretty?” asked Goriot. “She has good\ntaste, hasn’t she? Eh?”",
        "Vautrin, Father Goriot, and Rastignac came downstairs in company, and,\nall three of them being late, were obliged to sit together.",
        "Eugene was as distant as possible in his manner to Vautrin during\ndinner; but the other, so charming in Mme. Vauquer’s opinion, had\nnever been so witty. His lively sallies and sparkling talk put the\nwhole table in good humor. His assurance and coolness filled Eugene\nwith consternation.",
        "“Why, what has come to you to-day?” inquired Mme. Vauquer. “You are as\nmerry as a skylark.”",
        "“I am always in spirits after I have made a good bargain.”",
        "“Bargain?” said Eugene.",
        "“Well, yes, bargain. I have just delivered a lot of goods, and I shall\nbe paid a handsome commission on them–Mlle. Michonneau,” he went on,\nseeing that the elderly spinster was scrutinizing him intently, “have\nyou any objection to some feature in my face, that you are making\nthose lynx eyes at me? Just let me know, and I will have it changed to\noblige you . . . We shall not fall out about it, Poiret, I dare say?\"\nhe added, winking at the superannuated clerk.",
        "“Bless my soul, you ought to stand as model for a burlesque Hercules,\"\nsaid the young painter.",
        "“I will, upon my word! if Mlle. Michonneau will consent to sit as the\nVenus of Pere-Lachaise,” replied Vautrin.",
        "“There’s Poiret,” suggested Bianchon.",
        "“Oh! Poiret shall pose as Poiret. He can be a garden god!” cried\nVautrin; “his name means a pear––”",
        "“A sleepy pear!” Bianchon put in. “You will come in between the pear\nand the cheese.”",
        "“What stuff are you all talking!” said Mme. Vauquer; “you would do\nbetter to treat us to your Bordeaux; I see a glimpse of a bottle\nthere. It would keep us all in a good humor, and it is good for the\nstomach besides.”",
        "“Gentlemen,” said Vautrin, “the Lady President calls us to order. Mme.\nCouture and Mlle. Victorine will take your jokes in good part, but\nrespect the innocence of the aged Goriot. I propose a glass or two of\nBordeauxrama, rendered twice illustrious by the name of Laffite, no\npolitical allusions intended.–Come, you Turk!” he added, looking at\nChristophe, who did not offer to stir. “Christophe! Here! What, you\ndon’t answer to your own name? Bring us some liquor, Turk!”",
        "“Here it is, sir,” said Christophe, holding out the bottle.",
        "Vautrin filled Eugene’s glass and Goriot’s likewise, then he\ndeliberately poured out a few drops into his own glass, and sipped it\nwhile his two neighbors drank their wine. All at once he made a\ngrimace.",
        "“Corked!” he cried. “The devil! You can drink the rest of this,\nChristophe, and go and find another bottle; take from the right-hand\nside, you know. There are sixteen of us; take down eight bottles.”",
        "“If you are going to stand treat,” said the painter, “I will pay for a\nhundred chestnuts.”",
        "“Oh! oh!”",
        "“Booououh!”",
        "“Prrr!”",
        "These exclamations came from all parts of the table like squibs from a\nset firework.",
        "“Come, now, Mama Vauquer, a couple of bottles of champagne,” called\nVautrin.",
        "“Quien! just like you! Why not ask for the whole house at once. A\ncouple of bottles of champagne; that means twelve francs! I shall\nnever see the money back again, I know! But if M. Eugene has a mind to\npay for it, I have some currant cordial.”",
        "“That currant cordial of hers is as bad as a black draught,” muttered\nthe medical student.",
        "“Shut up, Bianchon,” exclaimed Rastignac; “the very mention of black\ndraught makes me feel––. Yes, champagne, by all means; I will pay\nfor it,” he added.",
        "“Sylvie,” called Mme. Vauquer, “bring in some biscuits, and the little\ncakes.”",
        "“Those little cakes are mouldy graybeards,” said Vautrin. “But trot\nout the biscuits.”",
        "The Bordeaux wine circulated; the dinner table became a livelier scene\nthan ever, and the fun grew fast and furious. Imitations of the cries\nof various animals mingled with the loud laughter; the Museum official\nhaving taken it into his head to mimic a cat-call rather like the\ncaterwauling of the animal in question, eight voices simultaneously\nstruck up with the following variations:",
        "“Scissors to grind!”",
        "“Chick-weeds for singing bir-ds!”",
        "“Brandy-snaps, ladies!”",
        "“China to mend!”",
        "“Boat ahoy!”",
        "“Sticks to beat your wives or your clothes!”",
        "“Old clo’!”",
        "“Cherries all ripe!”",
        "But the palm was awarded to Bianchon for the nasal accent with which\nhe rendered the cry of “Umbrellas to me-end!”",
        "A few seconds later, and there was a head-splitting racket in the\nroom, a storm of tomfoolery, a sort of cats’ concert, with Vautrin as\nconductor of the orchestra, the latter keeping an eye the while on\nEugene and Father Goriot. The wine seemed to have gone to their heads\nalready. They leaned back in their chairs, looking at the general\nconfusion with an air of gravity, and drank but little; both of them\nwere absorbed in the thought of what lay before them to do that\nevening, and yet neither of them felt able to rise and go. Vautrin\ngave a side glance at them from time to time, and watched the change\nthat came over their faces, choosing the moment when their eyes\ndrooped and seemed about to close, to bend over Rastignac and to say\nin his ear:–",
        "“My little lad, you are not quite shrewd enough to outwit Papa Vautrin\nyet, and he is too fond of you to let you make a mess of your affairs.\nWhen I have made up my mind to do a thing, no one short of Providence\ncan put me off. Aha! we were for going round to warn old Taillefer,\ntelling tales out of school! The oven is hot, the dough is kneaded,\nthe bread is ready for the oven; to-morrow we will eat it up and\nwhisk away the crumbs; and we are not going to spoil the baking?\n. . . No, no, it is all as good as done! We may suffer from a few\nconscientious scruples, but they will be digested along with the\nbread. While we are having our forty winks, Colonel Count Franchessini\nwill clear the way to Michel Taillefer’s inheritance with the point of\nhis sword. Victorine will come in for her brother’s money, a snug\nfifteen thousand francs a year. I have made inquiries already, and I\nknow that her late mother’s property amounts to more than three\nhundred thousand––”",
        "Eugene heard all this, and could not answer a word; his tongue seemed\nto be glued to the roof of his mouth, an irresistible drowsiness was\ncreeping over him. He still saw the table and the faces round it, but\nit was through a bright mist. Soon the noise began to subside, one by\none the boarders went. At last, when their numbers had so dwindled\nthat the party consisted of Mme. Vauquer, Mme. Couture, Mlle.\nVictorine, Vautrin, and Father Goriot, Rastignac watched as though in\na dream how Mme. Vauquer busied herself by collecting the bottles, and\ndrained the remainder of the wine out of each to fill others.",
        "“Oh! how uproarious they are! what a thing it is to be young!” said\nthe widow.",
        "These were the last words that Eugene heard and understood.",
        "“There is no one like M. Vautrin for a bit of fun like this,” said\nSylvie. “There, just hark at Christophe, he is snoring like a top.”",
        "“Good-bye, mamma,” said Vautrin; “I am going to a theatre on the\nboulevard to see M. Marty in Le Mont Sauvage, a fine play taken from\nLe Solitaire. . . . If you like, I will take you and these two\nladies––”",
        "“Thank you; I must decline,” said Mme. Couture.",
        "“What! my good lady!” cried Mme. Vauquer, “decline to see a play\nfounded on the Le Solitaire, a work by Atala de Chateaubriand? We were\nso fond of that book that we cried over it like Magdalens under the\nline-trees last summer, and then it is an improving work that might\nedify your young lady.”",
        "“We are forbidden to go to the play,” answered Victorine.",
        "“Just look, those two yonder have dropped off where they sit,” said\nVautrin, shaking the heads of the two sleepers in a comical way.",
        "He altered the sleeping student’s position, settled his head more\ncomfortably on the back of his chair, kissed him warmly on the\nforehead, and began to sing:",
        "     “Sleep, little darlings;\n      I watch while you slumber.”",
        "“I am afraid he may be ill,” said Victorine.",
        "“Then stop and take care of him,” returned Vautrin. “’Tis your duty\nas a meek and obedient wife,” he whispered in her ear. “The young\nfellow worships you, and you will be his little wife–there’s your\nfortune for you. In short,” he added aloud, “they lived happily ever\nafterwards, were much looked up to in all the countryside, and had a\nnumerous family. That is how all the romances end.–Now, mamma,” he\nwent on, as he turned to Madame Vauquer and put his arm round her\nwaist, “put on your bonnet, your best flowered silk, and the countess’\nscarf, while I go out and call a cab–all my own self.”",
        "And he started out, singing as he went:",
        "     “Oh! sun! divine sun!\n      Ripening the pumpkins every one.”",
        "“My goodness! Well, I’m sure! Mme. Couture, I could live happily in a\ngarret with a man like that.–There, now!” she added, looking round\nfor the old vermicelli maker, “there is that Father Goriot half seas\nover. He never thought of taking me anywhere, the old skinflint. But\nhe will measure his length somewhere. My word! it is disgraceful to\nlose his senses like that, at his age! You will be telling me that he\ncouldn’t lose what he hadn’t got–Sylvie, just take him up to his\nroom!”",
        "Sylvie took him by the arm, supported him upstairs, and flung him just\nas he was, like a package, across the bed.",
        "“Poor young fellow!” said Mme. Couture, putting back Eugene’s hair\nthat had fallen over his eyes; “he is like a young girl, he does not\nknow what dissipation is.”",
        "“Well, I can tell you this, I know,” said Mme. Vauquer, “I have taken\nlodgers these thirty years, and a good many have passed through my\nhands, as the saying is, but I have never seen a nicer nor a more\naristocratic looking young man than M. Eugene. How handsome he looks\nsleeping! Just let his head rest on your shoulder, Mme. Couture.\nPshaw! he falls over towards Mlle. Victorine. There’s a special\nprovidence for young things. A little more, and he would have broken\nhis head against the knob of the chair. They’d make a pretty pair\nthose two would!”",
        "“Hush, my good neighbor,” cried Mme. Couture, “you are saying such\nthings––”",
        "“Pooh!” put in Mme. Vauquer, “he does not hear.–Here, Sylvie! come\nand help me to dress. I shall put on my best stays.”",
        "“What! your best stays just after dinner, madame?” said Sylvie. “No,\nyou can get some one else to lace you. I am not going to be your\nmurderer. It’s a rash thing to do, and might cost you your life.”",
        "“I don’t care, I must do honor to M. Vautrin.”",
        "“Are you so fond of your heirs as all that?”",
        "“Come, Sylvie, don’t argue,” said the widow, as she left the room.",
        "“At her age, too!” said the cook to Victorine, pointing to her\nmistress as she spoke.",
        "Mme. Couture and her ward were left in the dining-room, and Eugene\nslept on Victorine’s shoulder. The sound of Christophe’s snoring\nechoed through the silent house; Eugene’s quiet breathing seemed all\nthe quieter by force of contrast, he was sleeping as peacefully as a\nchild. Victorine was very happy; she was free to perform one of those\nacts of charity which form an innocent outlet for all the overflowing\nsentiments of a woman’s nature; he was so close to her that she could\nfeel the throbbing of his heart; there was a look of almost maternal\nprotection and conscious pride in Victorine’s face. Among the\ncountless thoughts that crowded up in her young innocent heart, there\nwas a wild flutter of joy at this close contact.",
        "“Poor, dear child!” said Mme. Couture, squeezing her hand.",
        "The old lady looked at the girl. Victorine’s innocent, pathetic face,\nso radiant with the new happiness that had befallen her, called to\nmind some naive work of mediaeval art, when the painter neglected the\naccessories, reserving all the magic of his brush for the quiet,\naustere outlines and ivory tints of the face, which seems to have\ncaught something of the golden glory of heaven.",
        "“After all, he only took two glasses, mamma,” said Victorine, passing\nher fingers through Eugene’s hair.",
        "“Indeed, if he had been a dissipated young man, child, he would have\ncarried his wine like the rest of them. His drowsiness does him\ncredit.”",
        "There was a sound of wheels outside in the street.",
        "“There is M. Vautrin, mamma,” said the girl. “Just take M. Eugene. I\nwould rather not have that man see me like this; there are some ways\nof looking at you that seem to sully your soul and make you feel as\nthough you had nothing on.”",
        "“Oh, no, you are wrong!” said Mme. Couture. “M. Vautrin is a worthy\nman; he reminds me a little of my late husband, poor dear M. Couture,\nrough but kind-hearted; his bark is worse than his bite.”",
        "Vautrin came in while she was speaking; he did not make a sound, but\nlooked for a while at the picture of the two young faces–the\nlamplight falling full upon them seemed to caress them.",
        "“Well,” he remarked, folding his arms, “here is a picture! It would\nhave suggested some pleasing pages to Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (good\nsoul), who wrote Paul et Virginie. Youth is very charming, Mme.\nCouture!–Sleep on, poor boy,” he added, looking at Eugene, “luck\nsometimes comes while you are sleeping.–There is something touching\nand attractive to me about this young man, madame,” he continued; “I\nknow that his nature is in harmony with his face. Just look, the head\nof a cherub on an angel’s shoulder! He deserves to be loved. If I were\na woman, I would die (no–not such a fool), I would live for him.” He\nbent lower and spoke in the widow’s ear. “When I see those two\ntogether, madame, I cannot help thinking that Providence meant them\nfor each other; He works by secret ways, and tries the reins and the\nheart,” he said in a loud voice. “And when I see you, my children,\nthus united by a like purity and by all human affections, I say to\nmyself that it is quite impossible that the future should separate\nyou. God is just.\"–He turned to Victorine. “It seems to me,” he said,\n“that I have seen the line of success in your hand. Let me look at it,\nMlle. Victorine; I am well up in palmistry, and I have told fortunes\nmany a time. Come, now, don’t be frightened. Ah! what do I see? Upon\nmy word, you will be one of the richest heiresses in Paris before very\nlong. You will heap riches on the man who loves you. Your father will\nwant you to go and live with him. You will marry a young and handsome\nman with a title, and he will idolize you.”",
        "The heavy footsteps of the coquettish widow, who was coming down the\nstairs, interrupted Vautrin’s fortune-telling. “Here is Mamma\nVauquerre, fair as a starr-r-r, dressed within an inch of her life.\n–Aren’t we a trifle pinched for room?” he inquired, with his arm\nround the lady; “we are screwed up very tightly about the bust, mamma!\nIf we are much agitated, there may be an explosion; but I will pick up\nthe fragments with all the care of an antiquary.”",
        "“There is a man who can talk the language of French gallantry!” said\nthe widow, bending to speak in Mme. Couture’s ear.",
        "“Good-bye, little ones!” said Vautrin, turning to Eugene and\nVictorine. “Bless you both!” and he laid a hand on either head. “Take\nmy word for it, young lady, an honest man’s prayers are worth\nsomething; they should bring you happiness, for God hears them.”",
        "“Good-bye, dear,” said Mme. Vauquer to her lodger. “Do you think that\nM. Vautrin means to run away with me?” she added, lowering her voice.",
        "“Lack-a-day!” said the widow.",
        "“Oh! mamma dear, suppose it should really happen as that kind M.\nVautrin said!” said Victorine with a sigh as she looked at her hands.\nThe two women were alone together.",
        "“Why, it wouldn’t take much to bring it to pass,” said the elderly\nlady; “just a fall from his horse, and your monster of a brother––”",
        "“Oh! mamma.”",
        "“Good Lord! Well, perhaps it is a sin to wish bad luck to an enemy,\"\nthe widow remarked. “I will do penance for it. Still, I would strew\nflowers on his grave with the greatest pleasure, and that is the\ntruth. Black-hearted, that he is! The coward couldn’t speak up for his\nown mother, and cheats you out of your share by deceit and trickery.\nMy cousin had a pretty fortune of her own, but unluckily for you,\nnothing was said in the marriage-contract about anything that she\nmight come in for.”",
        "“It would be very hard if my fortune is to cost some one else his\nlife,” said Victorine. “If I cannot be happy unless my brother is to\nbe taken out of the world, I would rather stay here all my life.”",
        "“Mon Dieu! it is just as that good M. Vautrin says, and he is full\nof piety, you see,” Mme. Couture remarked. “I am very glad to find\nthat he is not an unbeliever like the rest of them that talk of the\nAlmighty with less respect than they do of the Devil. Well, as he was\nsaying, who can know the ways by which it may please Providence to\nlead us?”",
        "With Sylvie’s help the two women at last succeeded in getting Eugene\nup to his room; they laid him on the bed, and the cook unfastened his\nclothes to make him more comfortable. Before they left the room,\nVictorine snatched an opportunity when her guardian’s back was turned,\nand pressed a kiss on Eugene’s forehead, feeling all the joy that this\nstolen pleasure could give her. Then she looked round the room, and\ngathering up, as it were, into one single thought all the untold bliss\nof that day, she made a picture of her memories, and dwelt upon it\nuntil she slept, the happiest creature in Paris.",
        "That evening’s merry-making, in the course of which Vautrin had given\nthe drugged wine to Eugene and Father Goriot, was his own ruin.\nBianchon, flustered with wine, forgot to open the subject of\nTrompe-la-Mort with Mlle. Michonneau. The mere mention of the name\nwould have set Vautrin on his guard; for Vautrin, or, to give him his\nreal name, Jacques Collin, was in fact the notorious escaped convict.",
        "But it was the joke about the Venus of Pere-Lachaise that finally\ndecided his fate. Mlle. Michonneau had very nearly made up her mind to\nwarn the convict and to throw herself on his generosity, with the idea\nof making a better bargain for herself by helping him to escape that\nnight; but as it was, she went out escorted by Poiret in search of the\nfamous chief of detectives in the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, still\nthinking that it was the district superintendent–one Gondureau–with\nwhom she had to do. The head of the department received his visitors\ncourteously. There was a little talk, and the details were definitely\narranged. Mlle. Michonneau asked for the draught that she was to\nadminister in order to set about her investigation. But the great\nman’s evident satisfaction set Mlle. Michonneau thinking; and she\nbegan to see that this business involved something more than the mere\ncapture of a runaway convict. She racked her brains while he looked in\na drawer in his desk for the little phial, and it dawned upon her that\nin consequence of treacherous revelations made by the prisoners the\npolice were hoping to lay their hands on a considerable sum of money.\nBut on hinting her suspicions to the old fox of the Petite Rue\nSaint-Anne, that officer began to smile, and tried to put her off the\nscent.",
        "“A delusion,” he said. “Collin’s sorbonne is the most dangerous that\nhas yet been found among the dangerous classes. That is all, and the\nrascals are quite aware of it. They rally round him; he is the\nbackbone of the federation, its Bonaparte, in short; he is very\npopular with them all. The rogue will never leave his chump in the\nPlace de Greve.”",
        "As Mlle. Michonneau seemed mystified, Gondureau explained the two\nslang words for her benefit. Sorbonne and chump are two forcible\nexpressions borrowed from thieves’ Latin, thieves, of all people,\nbeing compelled to consider the human head in its two aspects. A\nsorbonne is the head of a living man, his faculty of thinking–his\ncouncil; a chump is a contemptuous epithet that implies how little a\nhuman head is worth after the axe has done its work.",
        "“Collin is playing us off,” he continued. “When we come across a man\nlike a bar of steel tempered in the English fashion, there is always\none resource left–we can kill him if he takes it into his head to\nmake the least resistance. We are reckoning on several methods of\nkilling Collin to-morrow morning. It saves a trial, and society is rid\nof him without all the expense of guarding and feeding him. What with\ngetting up the case, summoning witnesses, paying their expenses, and\ncarrying out the sentence, it costs a lot to go through all the proper\nformalities before you can get quit of one of these good-for-nothings,\nover and above the three thousand francs that you are going to have.\nThere is a saving in time as well. One good thrust of the bayonet into\nTrompe-la-Mort’s paunch will prevent scores of crimes, and save fifty\nscoundrels from following his example; they will be very careful to\nkeep themselves out of the police courts. That is doing the work of\nthe police thoroughly, and true philanthropists will tell you that it\nis better to prevent crime than to punish it.”",
        "“And you do a service to our country,” said Poiret.",
        "“Really, you are talking in a very sensible manner tonight, that you\nare,” said the head of the department. “Yes, of course, we are serving\nour country, and we are very hardly used too. We do society very great\nservices that are not recognized. In fact, a superior man must rise\nabove vulgar prejudices, and a Christian must resign himself to the\nmishaps that doing right entails, when right is done in an\nout-of-the-way style. Paris is Paris, you see! That is the explanation\nof my life.–I have the honor to wish you a good-evening, mademoiselle.\nI shall bring my men to the Jardin du Roi in the morning. Send\nChristophe to the Rue du Buffon, tell him to ask for M. Gondureau in\nthe house where you saw me before.–Your servant, sir. If you should\never have anything stolen from you, come to me, and I will do my best\nto get it back for you.”",
        "“Well, now,” Poiret remarked to Mlle. Michonneau, “there are idiots\nwho are scared out of their wits by the word police. That was a very\npleasant-spoken gentleman, and what he wants you to do is as easy as\nsaying ’Good-day.’”",
        "The next day was destined to be one of the most extraordinary in the\nannals of the Maison Vauquer. Hitherto the most startling occurrence\nin its tranquil existence had been the portentous, meteor-like\napparition of the sham Comtesse de l’Ambermesnil. But the catastrophes\nof this great day were to cast all previous events into the shade, and\nsupply an inexhaustible topic of conversation for Mme. Vauquer and her\nboarders so long as she lived.",
        "In the first place, Goriot and Eugene de Rastignac both slept till\nclose upon eleven o’clock. Mme. Vauquer, who came home about midnight\nfrom the Gaite, lay a-bed till half-past ten. Christophe, after a\nprolonged slumber (he had finished Vautrin’s first bottle of wine),\nwas behindhand with his work, but Poiret and Mlle. Michonneau uttered\nno complaint, though breakfast was delayed. As for Victorine and Mme.\nCouture, they also lay late. Vautrin went out before eight o’clock,\nand only came back just as breakfast was ready. Nobody protested,\ntherefore, when Sylvie and Christophe went up at a quarter past\neleven, knocked at all the doors, and announced that breakfast was\nwaiting. While Sylvie and the man were upstairs, Mlle. Michonneau, who\ncame down first, poured the contents of the phial into the silver cup\nbelonging to Vautrin–it was standing with the others in the\nbain-marie that kept the cream hot for the morning coffee. The spinster\nhad reckoned on this custom of the house to do her stroke of business.\nThe seven lodgers were at last collected together, not without some\ndifficulty. Just as Eugene came downstairs, stretching himself and\nyawning, a commissionaire handed him a letter from Mme. de Nucingen.\nIt ran thus:–",
        "“I feel neither false vanity nor anger where you are concerned, my\nfriend. Till two o’clock this morning I waited for you. Oh, that\nwaiting for one whom you love! No one that had passed through that\ntorture could inflict it on another. I know now that you have never\nloved before. What can have happened? Anxiety has taken hold of me. I\nwould have come myself to find out what had happened, if I had not\nfeared to betray the secrets of my heart. How can I walk out or drive\nout at this time of day? Would it not be ruin? I have felt to the full\nhow wretched it is to be a woman. Send a word to reassure me, and\nexplain how it is that you have not come after what my father told\nyou. I shall be angry, but I will forgive you. One word, for pity’s\nsake. You will come to me soon, will you not? If you are busy, a line\nwill be enough. Say, ’I will hasten to you,’ or else, ’I am ill.’ But\nif you were ill my father would have come to tell me so. What can have\nhappened? . . .”",
        "“Yes, indeed, what has happened?” exclaimed Eugene, and, hurrying down\nto the dining-room, he crumpled up the letter without reading any\nmore. “What time is it?”",
        "“Half-past eleven,” said Vautrin, dropping a lump of sugar into his\ncoffee.",
        "The escaped convict cast a glance at Eugene, a cold and fascinating\nglance; men gifted with this magnetic power can quell furious lunatics\nin a madhouse by such a glance, it is said. Eugene shook in every\nlimb. There was the sound of wheels in the street, and in another\nmoment a man with a scared face rushed into the room. It was one of M.\nTaillefer’s servants; Mme. Couture recognized the livery at once.",
        "“Mademoiselle,” he cried, “your father is asking for you–something\nterrible has happened! M. Frederic has had a sword thrust in the\nforehead in a duel, and the doctors have given him up. You will\nscarcely be in time to say good-bye to him! he is unconscious.”",
        "“Poor young fellow!” exclaimed Vautrin. “How can people brawl when\nthey have a certain income of thirty thousand livres? Young people\nhave bad manners, and that is a fact.”",
        "“Sir!” cried Eugene.",
        "“Well, what then, you big baby!” said Vautrin, swallowing down his\ncoffee imperturbably, an operation which Mlle. Michonneau watched with\nsuch close attention that she had no emotion to spare for the amazing\nnews that had struck the others dumb with amazement. “Are there not\nduels every morning in Paris?” added Vautrin.",
        "“I will go with you, Victorine,” said Mme. Couture, and the two women\nhurried away at once without either hats or shawls. But before she\nwent, Victorine, with her eyes full of tears, gave Eugene a glance\nthat said–\"How little I thought that our happiness should cost me\ntears!”",
        "“Dear me, you are a prophet, M. Vautrin,” said Mme. Vauquer.",
        "“I am all sorts of things,” said Vautrin.",
        "“Queer, isn’t it?” said Mme. Vauquer, stringing together a succession\nof commonplaces suited to the occasion. “Death takes us off without\nasking us about it. The young often go before the old. It is a lucky\nthing for us women that we are not liable to fight duels, but we have\nother complaints that men don’t suffer from. We bear children, and it\ntakes a long time to get over it. What a windfall for Victorine! Her\nfather will have to acknowledge her now!”",
        "“There!” said Vautrin, looking at Eugene, “yesterday she had not a\npenny; this morning she has several millions to her fortune.”",
        "“I say, M. Eugene!” cried Mme. Vauquer, “you have landed on your\nfeet!”",
        "At this exclamation, Father Goriot looked at the student, and saw the\ncrumpled letter still in his hand.",
        "“You have not read it through! What does this mean? Are you going to\nbe like the rest of them?” he asked.",
        "“Madame, I shall never marry Mlle. Victorine,” said Eugene, turning to\nMme. Vauquer with an expression of terror and loathing that surprised\nthe onlookers at this scene.",
        "Father Goriot caught the student’s hand and grasped it warmly. He\ncould have kissed it.",
        "“Oh, ho!” said Vautrin, “the Italians have a good proverb–Col\ntempo.”",
        "“Is there any answer?” said Mme. de Nucingen’s messenger, addressing\nEugene.",
        "“Say that I will come directly.”",
        "The man went. Eugene was in a state of such violent excitement that he\ncould not be prudent.",
        "“What is to be done?” he exclaimed aloud. “There are no proofs!”",
        "Vautrin began to smile. Though the drug he had taken was doing its\nwork, the convict was so vigorous that he rose to his feet, gave\nRastignac a look, and said in hollow tones, “Luck comes to us while we\nsleep, young man,” and fell stiff and stark, as if he were struck\ndead.",
        "“So there is a Divine Justice!” said Eugene.",
        "“Well, if ever! What has come to that poor dear M. Vautrin?”",
        "“A stroke!” cried Mlle. Michonneau.",
        "“Here, Sylvie! girl, run for the doctor,” called the widow. “Oh, M.\nRastignac, just go for M. Bianchon, and be as quick as you can; Sylvie\nmight not be in time to catch our doctor, M. Grimprel.”",
        "Rastignac was glad of an excuse to leave that den of horrors, his\nhurry for the doctor was nothing but a flight.",
        "“Here, Christophe, go round to the chemist’s and ask for something\nthat’s good for the apoplexy.”",
        "Christophe likewise went.",
        "“Father Goriot, just help us to get him upstairs.”",
        "Vautrin was taken up among them, carried carefully up the narrow\nstaircase, and laid upon his bed.",
        "“I can do no good here, so I shall go to see my daughter,” said M.\nGoriot.",
        "“Selfish old thing!” cried Mme. Vauquer. “Yes, go; I wish you may die\nlike a dog.”",
        "“Just go and see if you can find some ether,” said Mlle. Michonneau to\nMme. Vauquer; the former, with some help from Poiret, had unfastened\nthe sick man’s clothes.",
        "Mme. Vauquer went down to her room, and left Mlle. Michonneau mistress\nof the situation.",
        "“Now! just pull down his shirt and turn him over, quick! You might be\nof some use in sparing my modesty,” she said to Poiret, “instead of\nstanding there like a stock.”",
        "Vautrin was turned over; Mlle. Michonneau gave his shoulder a sharp\nslap, and the two portentous letters appeared, white against the red.",
        "“There, you have earned your three thousand francs very easily,\"\nexclaimed Poiret, supporting Vautrin while Mlle. Michonneau slipped on\nthe shirt again.–\"Ouf! How heavy he is,” he added, as he laid the\nconvict down.",
        "“Hush! Suppose there is a strong-box here!” said the old maid briskly;\nher glances seemed to pierce the walls, she scrutinized every article\nof the furniture with greedy eyes. “Could we find some excuse for\nopening that desk?”",
        "“It mightn’t be quite right,” responded Poiret to this.",
        "“Where is the harm? It is money stolen from all sorts of people, so it\ndoesn’t belong to any one now. But we haven’t time, there is the\nVauquer.”",
        "“Here is the ether,” said that lady. “I must say that this is an\neventful day. Lord! that man can’t have had a stroke; he is as white\nas curds.”",
        "“White as curds?” echoed Poiret.",
        "“And his pulse is steady,” said the widow, laying her hand on his\nbreast.",
        "“Steady?” said the astonished Poiret.",
        "“He is all right.”",
        "“Do you think so?” asked Poiret.",
        "“Lord! Yes, he looks as if he were sleeping. Sylvie has gone for a\ndoctor. I say, Mlle. Michonneau, he is sniffing the ether. Pooh! it is\nonly a spasm. His pulse is good. He is as strong as a Turk. Just look,\nmademoiselle, what a fur tippet he has on his chest; that is the sort\nof man to live till he is a hundred. His wig holds on tightly,\nhowever. Dear me! it is glued on, and his own hair is red; that is why\nhe wears a wig. They say that red-haired people are either the worst\nor the best. Is he one of the good ones, I wonder?”",
        "“Good to hang,” said Poiret.",
        "“Round a pretty woman’s neck, you mean,” said Mlle Michonneau,\nhastily. “Just go away, M. Poiret. It is a woman’s duty to nurse you\nmen when you are ill. Besides, for all the good you are doing, you may\nas well take yourself off,” she added. “Mme. Vauquer and I will take\ngreat care of dear M. Vautrin.",
        "Poiret went out on tiptoe without a murmur, like a dog kicked out of\nthe room by his master.",
        "Rastignac had gone out for the sake of physical exertion; he wanted to\nbreathe the air, he felt stifled. Yesterday evening he had meant to\nprevent the murder arranged for half-past eight that morning. What had\nhappened? What ought he to do now? He trembled to think that he\nhimself might be implicated. Vautrin’s coolness still further dismayed\nhim.",
        "“Yet, how if Vautrin should die without saying a word?” Rastignac\nasked himself.",
        "He hurried along the alleys of the Luxembourg Gardens as if the hounds\nof justice were after him, and he already heard the baying of the\npack.",
        "“Well?” shouted Bianchon, “you have seen the Pilote?”",
        "The Pilote was a Radical sheet, edited by M. Tissot. It came out\nseveral hours later than the morning papers, and was meant for the\nbenefit of country subscribers; for it brought the morning news into\nprovincial districts twenty-four hours sooner than the ordinary local\njournals.",
        "“There is a wonderful history in it,” said the house student of the\nHopital Cochin. “Young Taillefer called out Count Franchessini, of the\nOld Guard, and the Count put a couple of inches of steel into his\nforehead. And here is little Victorine one of the richest heiresses in\nParis! If we had known that, eh? What a game of chance death is! They\nsay Victorine was sweet on you; was there any truth in it?”",
        "“Shut up, Bianchon; I shall never marry her. I am in love with a\ncharming woman, and she is in love with me, so––”",
        "“You said that as if you were screwing yourself up to be faithful to\nher. I should like to see the woman worth the sacrifice of Master\nTaillefer’s money!”",
        "“Are all the devils of hell at my heels?” cried Rastignac.",
        "“What is the matter with you? Are you mad? Give us your hand,” said\nBianchon, “and let me feel your pulse. You are feverish.”",
        "“Just go to Mother Vauquer’s,” said Rastignac; “that scoundrel Vautrin\nhas dropped down like one dead.”",
        "“Aha!” said Bianchon, leaving Rastignac to his reflections, “you\nconfirm my suspicions, and now I mean to make sure for myself.”",
        "The law student’s long walk was a memorable one for him. He made in\nsome sort a survey of his conscience. After a close scrutiny, after\nhesitation and self-examination, his honor at any rate came out\nscatheless from this sharp and terrible ordeal, like a bar of iron\ntested in the English fashion. He remembered Father Goriot’s\nconfidences of the evening before; he recollected the rooms taken for\nhim in the Rue d’Artois, so that he might be near Delphine; and then\nhe thought of his letter, and read it again and kissed it.",
        "“Such a love is my anchor of safety,” he said to himself. “How the old\nman’s heart must have been wrung! He says nothing about all that he\nhas been through; but who could not guess? Well, then, I will be like\na son to him; his life shall be made happy. If she cares for me, she\nwill often come to spend the day with him. That grand Comtesse de\nRestaud is a heartless thing; she would make her father into her hall\nporter. Dear Delphine! she is kinder to the old man; she is worthy to\nbe loved. Ah! this evening I shall be very happy!”",
        "He took out his watch and admired it.",
        "“I have had nothing but success! If two people mean to love each other\nfor ever, they may help each other, and I can take this. Besides, I\nshall succeed, and I will pay her a hundredfold. There is nothing\ncriminal in this liaison; nothing that could cause the most austere\nmoralist to frown. How many respectable people contract similar\nunions! We deceive nobody; it is deception that makes a position\nhumiliating. If you lie, you lower yourself at once. She and her\nhusband have lived apart for a long while. Besides, how if I called\nupon that Alsatian to resign a wife whom he cannot make happy?”",
        "Rastignac’s battle with himself went on for a long while; and though\nthe scruples of youth inevitably gained the day, an irresistible\ncuriosity led him, about half-past four, to return to the Maison\nVauquer through the gathering dusk.",
        "Bianchon had given Vautrin an emetic, reserving the contents of the\nstomach for chemical analysis at the hospital. Mlle. Michonneau’s\nofficious alacrity had still further strengthened his suspicions of\nher. Vautrin, moreover, had recovered so quickly that it was\nimpossible not to suspect some plot against the leader of all frolics\nat the lodging-house. Vautrin was standing in front of the stove in\nthe dining-room when Rastignac came in. All the lodgers were assembled\nsooner than usual by the news of young Taillefer’s duel. They were\nanxious to hear any detail about the affair, and to talk over the\nprobable change in Victorine’s prospects. Father Goriot alone was\nabsent, but the rest were chatting. No sooner did Eugene come into the\nroom, than his eyes met the inscrutable gaze of Vautrin. It was the\nsame look that had read his thoughts before–the look that had such\npower to waken evil thoughts in his heart. He shuddered.",
        "“Well, dear boy,” said the escaped convict, “I am likely to cheat\ndeath for a good while yet. According to these ladies, I have had a\nstroke that would have felled an ox, and come off with flying colors.”",
        "“A bull you might say,” cried the widow.",
        "“You really might be sorry to see me still alive,” said Vautrin in\nRastignac’s ear, thinking that he guessed the student’s thoughts. “You\nmust be mighty sure of yourself.”",
        "“Mlle. Michonneau was talking the day before yesterday about a\ngentleman named Trompe-la-Mort,” said Bianchon; “and, upon my word,\nthat name would do very well for you.”",
        "Vautrin seemed thunderstruck. He turned pale, and staggered back. He\nturned his magnetic glance, like a ray of vivid light, on Mlle.\nMichonneau; the old maid shrank and trembled under the influence of\nthat strong will, and collapsed into a chair. The mask of good-nature\nhad dropped from the convict’s face; from the unmistakable ferocity of\nthat sinister look, Poiret felt that the old maid was in danger, and\nhastily stepped between them. None of the lodgers understood this\nscene in the least, they looked on in mute amazement. There was a\npause. Just then there was a sound of tramping feet outside; there\nwere soldiers there, it seemed, for there was a ring of several rifles\non the pavement of the street. Collin was mechanically looking round\nthe walls for a way of escape, when four men entered by way of the\nsitting-room.",
        "“In the name of the King and the Law!” said an officer, but the words\nwere almost lost in a murmur of astonishment.",
        "Silence fell on the room. The lodgers made way for three of the men,\nwho had each a hand on a cocked pistol in a side pocket. Two\npolicemen, who followed the detectives, kept the entrance to the\nsitting-room, and two more men appeared in the doorway that gave\naccess to the staircase. A sound of footsteps came from the garden,\nand again the rifles of several soldiers rang on the cobblestones\nunder the window. All chance of salvation by flight was cut off for\nTrompe-la-Mort, to whom all eyes instinctively turned. The chief\nwalked straight up to him, and commenced operations by giving him a\nsharp blow on the head, so that the wig fell off, and Collin’s face\nwas revealed in all its ugliness. There was a terrible suggestion of\nstrength mingled with cunning in the short, brick-red crop of hair,\nthe whole head was in harmony with his powerful frame, and at that\nmoment the fires of hell seemed to gleam from his eyes. In that flash\nthe real Vautrin shone forth, revealed at once before them all; they\nunderstood his past, his present, and future, his pitiless doctrines,\nhis actions, the religion of his own good pleasure, the majesty with\nwhich his cynicism and contempt for mankind invested him, the physical\nstrength of an organization proof against all trials. The blood flew\nto his face, and his eyes glared like the eyes of a wild cat. He\nstarted back with savage energy and a fierce growl that drew\nexclamations of alarm from the lodgers. At that leonine start the\npolice caught at their pistols under cover of the general clamor.\nCollin saw the gleaming muzzles of the weapons, saw his danger, and\ninstantly gave proof of a power of the highest order. There was\nsomething horrible and majestic in the spectacle of the sudden\ntransformation in his face; he could only be compared to a cauldron\nfull of the steam that can send mountains flying, a terrific force\ndispelled in a moment by a drop of cold water. The drop of water that\ncooled his wrathful fury was a reflection that flashed across his\nbrain like lightning. He began to smile, and looked down at his wig.",
        "“You are not in the politest of humors to-day,” he remarked to the\nchief, and he held out his hands to the policemen with a jerk of his\nhead.",
        "“Gentlemen,” he said, “put on the bracelets or the handcuffs. I call\non those present to witness that I make no resistance.”",
        "A murmur of admiration ran through the room at the sudden outpouring\nlike fire and lava flood from this human volcano, and its equally\nsudden cessation.",
        "“There’s a sell for you, master crusher,” the convict added, looking\nat the famous director of police.",
        "“Come, strip!” said he of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, contemptuously.",
        "“Why?” asked Collin. “There are ladies present; I deny nothing, and\nsurrender.”",
        "He paused, and looked round the room like an orator who is about to\noverwhelm his audience.",
        "“Take this down, Daddy Lachapelle,” he went on, addressing a little,\nwhite-haired old man who had seated himself at the end of the table;\nand after drawing a printed form from the portfolio, was proceeding to\ndraw up a document. “I acknowledge myself to be Jacques Collin,\notherwise known as Trompe-la-Mort, condemned to twenty years’ penal\nservitude, and I have just proved that I have come fairly by my\nnickname.–If I had as much as raised my hand,” he went on, addressing\nthe other lodgers, “those three sneaking wretches yonder would have\ndrawn claret on Mamma Vauquer’s domestic hearth. The rogues have laid\ntheir heads together to set a trap for me.”",
        "Mme. Vauquer felt sick and faint at these words.",
        "“Good Lord!” she cried, “this does give one a turn; and me at the\nGaite with him only last night!” she said to Sylvie.",
        "“Summon your philosophy, mamma,” Collin resumed. “Is it a misfortune\nto have sat in my box at the Gaite yesterday evening? After all, are\nyou better than we are? The brand upon our shoulders is less shameful\nthan the brand set on your hearts, you flabby members of a society\nrotten to the core. Not the best man among you could stand up to me.\"\nHis eyes rested upon Rastignac, to whom he spoke with a pleasant smile\nthat seemed strangely at variance with the savage expression in his\neyes.–\"Our little bargain still holds good, dear boy; you can accept\nany time you like! Do you understand?” And he sang:",
        "     “A charming girl is my Fanchette\n      In her simplicity.”",
        "“Don’t you trouble yourself,” he went on; “I can get in my money. They\nare too much afraid of me to swindle me.”",
        "The convicts’ prison, its language and customs, its sudden sharp\ntransitions from the humorous to the horrible, its appalling grandeur,\nits triviality and its dark depths, were all revealed in turn by the\nspeaker’s discourse; he seemed to be no longer a man, but the type and\nmouthpiece of a degenerate race, a brutal, supple, clear-headed race\nof savages. In one moment Collin became the poet of an inferno,\nwherein all thoughts and passions that move human nature (save\nrepentance) find a place. He looked about him like a fallen archangel\nwho is for war to the end. Rastignac lowered his eyes, and\nacknowledged this kinship claimed by crime as an expiation of his own\nevil thoughts.",
        "“Who betrayed me?” said Collin, and his terrible eyes traveled round\nthe room. Suddenly they rested on Mlle. Michonneau.",
        "“It was you, old cat!” he said. “That sham stroke of apoplexy was your\ndoing, lynx eyes! . . . Two words from me, and your throat would be\ncut in less than a week, but I forgive you, I am a Christian. You did\nnot sell me either. But who did?––Aha! you may rummage upstairs,” he\nshouted, hearing the police officers opening his cupboards and taking\npossession of his effects. “The nest is empty, the birds flew away\nyesterday, and you will be none the wiser. My ledgers are here,” he\nsaid tapping his forehead. “Now I know who sold me! It could only be\nthat blackguard Fil-de-Soie. That is who it was, old catchpoll, eh?\"\nhe said, turning to the chief. “It was timed so neatly to get the\nbanknotes up above there. There is nothing left for you–spies! As for\nFil-de-Soie, he will be under the daisies in less than a fortnight,\neven if you were to tell off the whole force to protect him. How much\ndid you give the Michonnette?” he asked of the police officers. “A\nthousand crowns? Oh you Ninon in decay, Pompadour in tatters, Venus of\nthe graveyard, I was worth more than that! If you had given me\nwarning, you should have had six thousand francs. Ah! you had no\nsuspicion of that, old trafficker in flesh and blood, or I should have\nhad the preference. Yes, I would have given six thousand francs to\nsave myself an inconvenient journey and some loss of money,” he said,\nas they fastened the handcuffs on his wrists. “These folks will amuse\nthemselves by dragging out this business till the end of time to keep\nme idle. If they were to send me straight to jail, I should soon be\nback at my old tricks in spite of the duffers at the Quai des\nOrfevres. Down yonder they will all turn themselves inside out to help\ntheir general–their good Trompe-la-Mort–to get clear away. Is there\na single one among you that can say, as I can, that he has ten\nthousand brothers ready to do anything for him?” he asked proudly.\n“There is some good there,” he said tapping his heart; “I have never\nbetrayed any one!–Look you here, you slut,” he said to the old maid,\n“they are all afraid of me, do you see? but the sight of you turns\nthem sick. Rake in your gains.”",
        "He was silent for a moment, and looked round at the lodgers’ faces.",
        "“What dolts you are, all of you! Have you never seen a convict before?\nA convict of Collin’s stamp, whom you see before you, is a man less\nweak-kneed than others; he lifts up his voice against the colossal\nfraud of the Social Contract, as Jean Jacques did, whose pupil he is\nproud to declare himself. In short, I stand here single-handed against\na Government and a whole subsidized machinery of tribunals and police,\nand I am a match for them all.”",
        "“Ye gods!” cried the painter, “what a magnificent sketch one might\nmake of him!”",
        "“Look here, you gentlemen-in-waiting to his highness the gibbet,\nmaster of ceremonies to the widow” (a nickname full of sombre poetry,\ngiven by prisoners to the guillotine), “be a good fellow, and tell me\nif it really was Fil-de-Soie who sold me. I don’t want him to suffer\nfor some one else, that would not be fair.”",
        "But before the chief had time to answer, the rest of the party\nreturned from making their investigations upstairs. Everything had\nbeen opened and inventoried. A few words passed between them and the\nchief, and the official preliminaries were complete.",
        "“Gentlemen,” said Collin, addressing the lodgers, “they will take me\naway directly. You have all made my stay among you very agreeable, and\nI shall look back upon it with gratitude. Receive my adieux, and\npermit me to send you figs from Provence.”",
        "He advanced a step or two, and then turned to look once more at\nRastignac.",
        "“Good-bye, Eugene,” he said, in a sad and gentle tone, a strange\ntransition from his previous rough and stern manner. “If you should be\nhard up, I have left you a devoted friend,” and, in spite of his\nshackles, he managed to assume a posture of defence, called, “One,\ntwo!” like a fencing-master, and lunged. “If anything goes wrong,\napply in that quarter. Man and money, all at your service.”",
        "The strange speaker’s manner was sufficiently burlesque, so that no\none but Rastignac knew that there was a serious meaning underlying the\npantomime.",
        "As soon as the police, soldiers, and detectives had left the house,\nSylvie, who was rubbing her mistress’ temples with vinegar, looked\nround at the bewildered lodgers.",
        "“Well,” said she, “he was a man, he was, for all that.”",
        "Her words broke the spell. Every one had been too much excited, too\nmuch moved by very various feelings to speak. But now the lodgers\nbegan to look at each other, and then all eyes were turned at once on\nMlle. Michonneau, a thin, shriveled, dead-alive, mummy-like figure,\ncrouching by the stove; her eyes were downcast, as if she feared that\nthe green eye-shade could not shut out the expression of those faces\nfrom her. This figure and the feeling of repulsion she had so long\nexcited were explained all at once. A smothered murmur filled the\nroom; it was so unanimous, that it seemed as if the same feeling of\nloathing had pitched all the voices in one key. Mlle. Michonneau heard\nit, and did not stir. It was Bianchon who was the first to move; he\nbent over his neighbor, and said in a low voice, “If that creature is\ngoing to stop here, and have dinner with us, I shall clear out.”",
        "In the twinkling of an eye it was clear that every one in the room,\nsave Poiret, was of the medical student’s opinion, so that the latter,\nstrong in the support of the majority, went up to that elderly person.",
        "“You are more intimate with Mlle. Michonneau than the rest of us,” he\nsaid; “speak to her, make her understand that she must go, and go at\nonce.”",
        "“At once!” echoed Poiret in amazement.",
        "Then he went across to the crouching figure, and spoke a few words in\nher ear.",
        "“I have paid beforehand for the quarter; I have as much right to be\nhere as any one else,” she said, with a viperous look at the boarders.",
        "“Never mind that! we will club together and pay you the money back,\"\nsaid Rastignac.",
        "“Monsieur is taking Collin’s part” she said, with a questioning,\nmalignant glance at the law student; “it is not difficult to guess\nwhy.”",
        "Eugene started forward at the words, as if he meant to spring upon her\nand wring her neck. That glance, and the depths of treachery that it\nrevealed, had been a hideous enlightenment.",
        "“Let her alone!” cried the boarders.",
