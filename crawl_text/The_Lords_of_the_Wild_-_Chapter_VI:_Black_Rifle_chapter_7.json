        "They had been following the trail about half an hour, when Tayoga\nnoticed that it was growing deeper.",
        "“Ah,” he said, “Black Rifle now walks much more slowly, so slow that\nhe barely creeps, and his feet press down harder. I think he is going\nto make another stop.”",
        "“Maybe he intends to cook a part of that fat bear,” said Grosvenor,\nstruggling hard, though, to keep all trace of envy out of his voice.\n“You said a while back that he was going to kill the bear, because he\nwas hungry, and it seems to me that he would be a very foolish man, if\nhaving got his bear, he didn’t make use of any portion of it.”",
        "Tayoga laughed with sincere enjoyment.",
        "“Red Coat reasons well,” he said. “If a man is eager to eat, and he\nhas that which he can eat, then he would be a silly man if he did not\neat. Red Coat has all the makings of a trailer. In a few more yards,\nBlack Rifle will stop and cook himself a splendid dinner. Here he put\nhis bear meat upon this log. The red stains show it. Then he picked up\ndead and fallen wood, and broke it into the right length over the log.\nYou can see where he broke places in the bark at the same time. Then\nhe heaped them all in the little hollow, where he has left the pile\nof ashes. But, before he lighted a fire, with his flint and steel,\nhe made a wide circle all about to see if any enemy might be near. We\nknew he would do that because Black Rifle is a very cautious man, but\nhis trail proves it to any one who wishes to look. Then, satisfied, he\ncame back, and started the flame. But he kept the blaze very low lest\na prowling foe see it. When the bed of coals was fanned he cooked\nlarge portions of the bear and ate, because Black Rifle was hungry,\nah, so hungry! and the bear was very savory and pleasing to his\npalate!”",
        "“Stop, Tayoga, stop!” exclaimed Grosvenor, “I can’t stand such\ntorture! You’ll make me starve to death where I stand.”",
        "“But as you are about to become a warrior of the woods, Red Coat,\"\nsaid the Onondaga gravely, “you must learn to endure. Among us a\nwarrior will purposely put the fire to his hand or his breast and hold\nit there until the flesh smokes. Nor will he utter a groan or even\nwince. And all his people will applaud him and call him brave.”",
        "Grosvenor shuddered. He did not see the lurking gleam of humor in the\neye of Tayoga.",
        "“I don’t need to pretend for the sake of practice that I am starving,\"\nhe said. “I’m starving in fact and I do it without the need of\napplause.”",
        "“But Black Rifle was enjoying himself greatly,” continued the\nOnondaga, “and we can rejoice in the joys of a friend. If we have not\na thing ourselves it is pleasant to know that somebody else had it.\nHe used his opportunities to the utmost. Here are more bones which\nhe threw away, with shreds of flesh yet on them, and which the forest\npeople came to pick clean. Lo, their tracks are everywhere about Black\nRifle’s little camp. One of them became so persistent and bold–a wolf\nit was–that Black Rifle, not willing to shoot, seized a large stone,\nand threw it at him with great violence. There lies the stone at the\nedge of the wood, and as there is fresh earth on its under surface it\nwas partly imbedded in the ground where Black Rifle snatched it up.\nThere, just beyond your right foot, Red Coat, is a little depression,\nthe place in the earth, from which he tore it. Black Rifle’s aim was\ngood too. He struck the wolf. At the foot of the bank there are\nred stains where several drops of blood fell. The wolf was full of\nmortification, pain and anger, when he ran away. He would never have\nbeen so bold and venturesome, if his hunger had not made him forget\nhis prudence. He was as hungry as you are this minute, Red Coat.”",
        "“I suppose you are giving me preliminary practice in torture, Tayoga.\nWell, go on with it, old fellow. I’ll try to stand it.”",
        "“No, that is enough as a beginning. We will follow the trail of Black\nRifle again. After he had eaten so well he was so much refreshed that\nhe will start again with a vigorous and strong step. Lo, it is as I\nsaid! He is taking a long stride, but I do not think he is walking\nfast. His pace is very slow. It may be that there is something in what\nDagaeoga says. It is possible that Black Rifle is waiting for those\nwho will not be unwelcome to him.”",
        "Robert was quite able to fathom what was passing in the brain of\nthe Onondaga. He saw that the trail was growing quite fresh, and his\nspirits became buoyant.",
        "“And Red Coat is hungry,” said Tayoga, that lurking gleam of humor in\nhis eye growing larger. “Let him remember that however he may suffer\nfrom lack of food he can suffer yet more. It is wonderful what the\nbody can endure and yet live. Here Black Rifle stopped and rested on\nthese stones, perhaps an hour. No, Red Coat, there are no signs to\nshow it, but the trail on the other side is much fresher, which proves\nit. It is quite clear now that Black Rifle is waiting. He is not\nrunning away from anybody or anything. Ah! Red Coat, if we only had\nsome of his precious bear steaks how welcome to us they would be!”",
        "“Go on, Tayoga. As I told you, I’d try to stand it.”",
        "“That is well, Red Coat. But it is not enough merely to wish for Black\nRifle’s bear steaks. We will have a portion of them ourselves.”",
        "“Now, Tayoga, your talk sounds a little wild to me.”",
        "“But listen, Red Coat.”",
        "The Onondaga suddenly put his fingers to his lips, and blew a shrill\nwhistle that penetrated far in the forest. In a few instants, the\nanswer, another whistle, came back from a point a few hundred yards\nahead, and Tayoga said quietly:",
        "“Red Coat, Black Rifle is waiting for us. We will now go forward and\nhe will give us our dinner.”",
        "They advanced without hesitation and the figure of the dark hunter\nrose up to meet them. His face showed pleasure, as he extended his\nhand first to Willet.",
        "“Dave, old comrade,” he said, “the sight of you in the forest is\nalways a pleasure to the eye. I thought you’d be coming with the lads,\nand I’ve been making ready for you. I knew that Tayoga, the greatest\ntrailer the world has ever known, would be sure to strike my traces,\nand that he’d read them like print. And here’s Robert too, a fine boy,\nif I do say it to his face, and Lieutenant Grosvenor. You mayn’t know\nme, Lieutenant, though I recall you, and I can tell you you’re mighty\nlucky to fall into the hands of these three.”",
        "“I think so too,” said Grosvenor earnestly.",
        "“Red Coat is happy to see you,” said Tayoga, “but he will be happier\nto see your bear.”",
        "“The Lieutenant is hungry,” said Black Rifle. “Then come; there is\nenough for all.”",
        "“What made you wait for us?” asked Robert.",
        "“You know how I roam the woods, doing as I please and under nobody’s\ncommand. I found that Tandakora was by the lake with warriors and\nthat St. Luc was not far away. Tandakora’s men seemed to be trailing\nsomebody, and hiding in the bushes, I spied on them. I was near enough\nto hear two warriors talking and I learned that it was you they were\nfollowing. Then, coming on ahead, I left a trail for you to see. And\nI’ve got plenty of bear steaks already cooked for you.”",
        "“God bless you, Mr. Black Rifle,” said Grosvenor fervently.",
        "“Amen!” said Robert.",
        "Black Rifle showed them his lair among dense bushes, and, after they\nhad satisfied their hunger, the bear, divided in equal portions among\nall, was stored away in their knapsacks, Grosvenor luckily having\nretained his own as the Indians had not deprived him of it. They now\nhad food enough for several days, and one great source of anxiety was\nremoved.",
        "“What had you found, Black Rifle?” asked Willet.",
        "“St. Luc has a big force. He’s throwing a sort of veil before\nMontcalm, while the Marquis fortifies to meet the attack of the\nBritish and Americans that all know is coming. Perhaps the Lieutenant\ncan tell us most about that force!”",
        "“It’s to be a great one,” said Grosvenor.",
        "“And we’ll go through to Quebec!” said Robert, his eyes flashing,\nhis imagination at once alive. “We’ll put out forever the fire that’s\nalways burning in the north and give our border peace.”",
        "“Easy, lads, easy!” said Willet. “A thing’s never done until it’s\ndone. I feel pretty sure we’ll do it, but we’ll reckon with present\ndifficulties first. It seems to me it’s our duty now to follow St.\nLuc, and see what he means to do with his force. It’s hard on you,\nLieutenant, because you’ll have to stay with us. You can’t go back to\nAlbany just yet.”",
        "Grosvenor glanced around at the unbroken forest. “I’m resigned,” he\nsaid. “After that wonderful escape I’m ready for anything. I see that\nthis is my great chance to become a scout, and I’ll do the best I\ncan.”",
        "“I take it,” said Black Rifle, “that the main object of St. Luc is to\nclear the forest of all our scouts and skirmishers in order that we\nmay be kept in complete ignorance of Montcalm’s movements. We’ll show\nhim that he can’t do it. You have not forgotten any of your skill,\nhave you, Tayoga?”",
        "“So far from forgetting any of it he’s acquired more,” said Willet,\nanswering for the Onondaga. “When it comes to trailing that boy just\nbreathes it in. He adds some new tricks every day. But I think we’d\nbetter lie by, the rest of to-day, and to-night, don’t you, Black\nRifle? We don’t want to wear out our lads at the start.”",
        "“Well spoken, Dave,” responded Black Rifle. “It’s a camp in the\nenemy’s country we’ll have to make with the warriors all about us, but\nwe must take the risk. We’d better go to the next brook and walk up it\na long distance. It’s the oldest of all tricks to hide your trail, but\nit is still the best.”",
        "They found the brook only a few hundred yards farther on, and\nextended their walk along its pebbly bed fully a mile and a half as a\nprecaution, keeping to their wading until they could emerge on rocky\nground, where they left no trail.",
        "“It will be only chance now that will bring them down on us,” said\nWillet. “Do you think, Lieutenant, that after such a long walk you\ncould manage another bear steak?”",
        "“If the company will join me!” replied Grosvenor. “I don’t wish to\nshow bad manners.”",
        "“I’ll join you,” said Willet, speaking for the others, “and I think\nwe’ll make a brief camp on that wooded hill there.”",
        "“Why on a hill, Mr. Willet? Why not in a hollow where it seems to me\nwe would be better hidden?”",
        "“Because, besides hiding ourselves, we want to see, and you can see\nbetter from a height than from a valley. In the bushes there we’ll\nhave a view all about us, and I don’t think our enemies can come\ntoo near, unseen by us. When we get into the thicket on the hill,\nLieutenant, you can resume that pleasant nap that you did not finish.\nEight or ten hours more of sleep will be just the thing for you.”",
        "“All of you sleep a while,” said Black Rifle. “I’ll guard. I’m fresh.\nBut be sure you walk on the stones. We must leave no trace.”",
        "They found a fairly comfortable place in the thicket and soon all were\nasleep except Black Rifle, who sat with his rifle between his knees,\nand from his covert scanned the forest on all sides.",
        "Black Rifle felt satisfaction. He was pleased to be with the friends\nfor whom he cared most. An historical figure, solitary, aloof, he was\na vivid personality, yet scarcely anything was known about him. His\nright name even had disappeared, and, to the border, far and near he\nwas just Black Rifle, or Black Jack, a great scout and a terror to the\nIndians. In his way, he was fond of Willet, Tayoga and young Lennox,\nand he felt also that he would like Grosvenor when he knew him better.\nSo, while they slept, he watched with a vigilance that nobody save\nTayoga could surpass.",
        "Black Rifle saw the life of the forest go on undisturbed. The birds on\nthe boughs went about their business, and the little animals worked\nor played as usual in the bushes. Everything said to him that no enemy\nwas near, and his own five senses confirmed it. The afternoon passed,\nand, about twilight, Tayoga awoke, but the others slept on.",
        "“Sleep now, Black Rifle,” said the Onondaga. “I will take up the\nwatch.”",
        "“I don’t feel like closing my eyes just yet, Tayoga,” replied the\nscout, “and I’ll sit a while with you. Nothing has happened. Tandakora\nhas not been able to find our trail.”",
        "“But he will hunt long for it, Black Rifle. When my race hates it\nhates well. Tandakora feels his grudge against us. He has tried to do\nus much harm and he is grieved because we have not fallen before him.\nHe blames us for it.”",
        "“I know he does. Did you hear something walking in the thicket at the\nbottom of the hill?”",
        "“It is only a bear. Perhaps he is looking for a good place in which to\npass the night, but he will go much farther away.”",
        "“Why, Tayoga?”",
        "“Because the wind is shifting about a little, and, in another minute,\nit will take him a whiff of the human odor. Then he will run away, and\nrun fast. Now he is running.”",
        "“I don’t hear him, Tayoga, but I take it that you know what you are\nsaying is true.”",
        "“My ears are uncommonly keen, Black Rifle. It is no merit of mine that\nthey are so. Why should a man talk about a gift from Manitou, when it\nreally is the work of Manitou? Ah, the bear is going toward the south\nand he is well frightened because he never stops to look back, nor\ndoes he hesitate! Now he is gone and he will not come back again!”",
        "Black Rifle glanced at the Onondaga in the dusk, and his eyes were\nfull of admiration.",
        "“You have wonderful gifts, Tayoga,” he said. “I don’t believe such\neyes and ears as yours are to be found in the head of any other man.”",
        "“But, as I have just told you, Black Rifle, however good they may\nbe the credit belongs to Manitou and not to me. I am but a poor\ninstrument.”",
        "“Still you find ’em useful, and the exercise of such powers must yield\na certain pleasure. They’re particularly valuable just now, as I’m\nthinking we’ll have an eventful night.”",
        "“I think so too, Black Rifle. With the warriors and the French so near\nus it is not likely that it could pass in peace.”",
        "“At any rate, Dave and the lads are not worrying about it. I never saw\nanybody sleep more soundly. I reckon they were pretty well worn out.”",
        "“So they were, and, unless danger comes very close, we will not awaken\nthem. That it will be near us soon I do not doubt because Tododaho\nwarns me that peril is at hand.”",
        "He was looking up at the star on which his patron saint sat and his\nface had that rapt expression which it always wore when his spirit\nleaped into the void to meet that of the great Onondaga chief who\nhad gone away four hundred years ago. Black Rifle regarded him with\nrespect. He too was steeped in Indian lore and belief, and, if Tayoga\nsaid he saw and heard what others could not hear or see, then he saw\nand heard them and that was all there was to it.",
        "“What do you see, Tayoga?” he asked.",
        "“Tododaho sits on his star with the wise snakes, coil on coil in\nhis hair, and the great Mohawk, Hayowentha, who is inferior only to\nTododaho, speaks to him from his own star across infinite space. They\nare talking of us, but it comes only as a whisper, like the dying\nvoice of a distant wind, and I cannot understand their words. But both\nthe great warriors look down warningly at us. They tell us to beware,\nthat we are threatened by a great peril. I can read their faces. But\na mist is passing in the heavens. The star of the Mohawk fades. Lo,\nit is gone! And now the vapors gather before the face of Tododaho too.\nLo, he also has gone, and there are only clouds and mists in the far\nheavens! But the great chiefs, from their stars, have told us to watch\nand to watch well.”",
        "“I believe you! I believe every word you say, Tayoga,” exclaimed Black\nRifle, in a tone of awe. “The mist is coming down here too. I think\nit’s floating in from the lake. It will be all over the thickets soon.\nI reckon that the danger threatening us is from the warriors, and\nif we are in a veil of fog we’ll have to rely on our ears. I’m not\nbragging when I say that mine are pretty good, but yours are better.”",
        "Tayoga did not reply. He knew that the compliment was true, but, as\nbefore, he ascribed the credit to Manitou because he had made the gift\nand not to himself who was merely an involuntary agent. The mist and\nvapors were increasing, drifting toward them in clouds from the lake,\na vanguard of shreds and patches, already floating over the bushes in\nwhich they lay. It was evident that soon they would not be able to see\nfive yards from there.",
        "In ten minutes the mist became a fog, white and thick. The sleeping\nthree were almost hidden, although they were at the feet of the\nwatchers, and the two saw each other but dimly. They seemed to be in\na tiny island with a white ocean circling about them. The Onondaga lay\nflat and put his ear to the earth.",
        "“What do you hear, Tayoga?” whispered the scout.",
        "“Nothing yet, Black Rifle, but the usual whispers of the wilderness, a\nlittle wind among the trees and a distant and uneasy deer walking.”",
        "“Why should a deer be walking about at this time, and why should he be\nuneasy, Tayoga? Any deer in his right mind ought to be taking his rest\nnow in the forest.”",
        "“That is true, Black Rifle, but this deer is worried and when a deer\nis worried there is a cause. A deer is not like a man, full of fancies\nand creating danger when danger there is none. He is troubled because\nthere are strange presences in the woods, presences that he dreads.”",
        "“Maybe he scents us.”",
        "“No, the wind does not blow from us toward him. Do not move! Do not\nstir in the least, Black Rifle! I think I catch another sound, almost\nas light as that made by a leaf when it falls! Ah, Manitou is good to\nme! He makes me hear to-night better than I ever heard before, because\nit is his purpose, I know not why, to make me do so! There comes the\nlittle sound again and it is real! It was a footstep far away, and\nthen another and another and now many! It is the tread of marching men\nand they are white men!”",
        "“How do you know they are white men, Tayoga?”",
        "“Mingled with the sound of their footsteps is a little clank made\nby the hilts of swords and the butts of pistols striking against the\nmetal on their belts. There is a slight creaking of leather, too,\nwhich could not possibly come from a band of warriors. I hear the echo\nof a voice! I think it is a command, a short, sharp word or two such\nas white officers give. The sounds of the footsteps merge now, Black\nRifle, because the men are marching to the same step. I think there\nmust be at least fifty of them. They are sure to be French, because\nwe are certain our troops are not yet in this region, and because only\nthe French are so active that they make these swift marches at night.”",
        "“Unfortunately that’s so, Tayoga. Will they pass near us?”",
        "“Very near us, but I do not think they will see us, as the fog is so\nthick.”",
        "“Should we wake the others and move?”",
        "“No, at least not yet. Now they are going very slowly. It is not\nbecause they do not know the way, but because the fog troubles them.\nIt is St. Luc who leads them.”",
        "“I don’t see how your ear can tell you that, Tayoga.”",
        "“It is not my ear, it is my mind that tells me, Black Rifle. The\nFrench would not go through the forest to-night, unless they had\nwarriors with them as guides, flankers and skirmishers. Only St. Luc\ncould make them come, because we know that even the French have great\ntrouble in inducing them to enter big battles. They like better ambush\nand foray. De Courcelles could not make them march on this journey nor\ncould Jumonville. My reason tells me it could be only St. Luc. It must\nbe!”",
        "“Yes, I’m sure now it’s St. Luc up to some trick that we ought to\nmeet.”",
        "“But we do not know what the trick is, Black Rifle. Ah, they have\nstopped! All of them have stopped!”",
        "“It is not possible that they have seen any traces of us, Tayoga! We\nleft no trail. Besides, this fog is so thick and heavy; it’s like a\nblanket hiding everything!”",
        "“No, it is not that. We left no trail. They are so near that we could\nsee them if there were no fog. Now I hear some one walking alone in\nfront of the company. His step is quick, sharp and positive. It is St.\nLuc, because, being the leader, he is the only one who would walk that\nway at such a time. I think he wants to see for himself or rather feel\njust where they are. Now he too stops, and some one walks forward to\njoin him. It is a Frenchman, because he has on boots. I can hear just\nthe faintest creak of the leather. It must be De Courcelles.”",
        "“It may be his comrade Jumonville.”",
        "“No, it is De Courcelles, because he is tall while Jumonville is not,\nand the stride of this man who is going forward to join St. Luc is\nlong. It is surely De Courcelles. St. Luc does not like him, but he\nhas to use him, because the Frenchmen are not many, and a leader can\nonly lead those who are at hand to be led. Now they talk together.\nPerhaps they are puzzled about the direction.”",
        "“Well, so would I be if I had to go anywhere in such a fog.”",
        "“They walk back together to the soldiers, and now there is no noise of\nfootsteps.”",
        "“I take it that they’re waiting for something.”",
        "“Aye, Black Rifle. They are waiting in the hope that the fog will\nrise. You know how suddenly a fog can lift and leave everything bright\nand clear.”",
        "“And they would see us at once. They’ll be fairly on top of us.”",
        "“So they would be, if the fog should go quickly away.”",
        "“And do you think it will?” asked Black Rifle in alarm.",
        "Tayoga laughed under his breath.",
        "“I do not,” he replied confidently. “There is no wind to take it away.\nThe great bank of mist and vapor will be heavy upon the ground and\nwill increase in thickness. It would not be wise for us to move,\nbecause there may be ears among them as keen as ours, and they might\nhear us. Then blinded by the fog we might walk directly into the hands\nof prowling warriors. Although we are not many yards from them we are\nsafest where we are, motionless and still.”",
        "Black Rifle also lay down and put his ear to the earth.",
        "“I hear very well myself, although not as well as you, Tayoga,” he\nwhispered, “and I want to notice what they’re doing as far as I can.\nI make out the sound of a lot of footsteps, but I can’t tell what they\nmean.”",
        "“They are sending groups in different directions, Black Rifle, looking\nfor a way through the forest rather than for us. They are still\nuncertain where they are. Five or six men are going southward, about\nas many have turned toward the west, and two warriors and a Frenchman\nare coming toward us, the rest stay where they are.”",
        "“It’s the three coming in our direction who are bothering me.”",
        "“But remember, Black Rifle, that we are hidden in the deep fog as a\nfish is hidden in the water, and it will be almost as hard to find us.\nThey must step nearly upon us before they could see us.”",
        "Black Rifle, in his eventful life upon the border, had passed through\nmany a crisis, but never any that tested his nerves more thoroughly\nthan the one he now faced. He too heard the steps of the three\nwarriors coming in their direction, cautiously feeling a way through\nthe great bank of mist. It was true that they could pass near without\nseeing, but chance might bring them straight to the little group. He\nshifted his fingers to the lock and trigger of his rifle, and looked\nat the sleeping three whose figures were almost hidden, although they\nwere not a yard away. He felt that they should be awake and ready but\nin waking, Grosvenor, at least, might make enough noise to draw the\nwarriors upon them at once.",
        "“They have shifted their course a little,” whispered Tayoga, “and\nit leads to our right. Now they change back again, and now they keep\nturning toward the left. I think they will pass eight or ten yards\nfrom us, which will be as good as five hundred or a thousand.”",
        "The white man slowly raised his rifle, but did not cock it. That\naction would have made a clicking sound, sharp and clear in the fog,\nbut the quick hands were ready for instant use. He knew, as Tayoga\nhad said, that the chance of the warriors walking upon them in the\nblinding fog was small, but if the chance came it would have to be met\nwith all their power and resource.",
        "“I think they will come within about ten feet of us,” continued\nTayoga, in his soft whisper. “There are two tall warriors and one\nquite short. The tall ones take about three steps to the short one’s\nfour and even then the short man is always behind. They do not walk\nin single file as usual, but spread out that they may cover as much\nground as possible. Now they are coming very near and I think it best,\nBlack Rifle, that I talk no more for the present, but I will hold my\nrifle ready as you are doing, if unlucky chance should bring them upon\nus.”",
        "The footsteps approached and passed a little to the left, but came so\nnear that Black Rifle almost fancied he could see the dim figures\nin the fog. When they went on he drew a mighty breath and wiped the\nperspiration from his face.",
        "“We fairly grazed the edge of death,” he whispered. “I’ll sit up now\nand you can do the rest of the listening all by yourself, Tayoga.”",
        "“The three have rejoined the main body,” said the Onondaga, “and the\nother parties that went out have also gone back. I think the one that\nwent south probably found the way in which they wanted to go, and they\nwill now move on, leaving us safe for the while. Yes, I can hear them\nmarching and the clank of the French weapons and equipment.”",
        "He listened a few minutes longer, and then announced that they were\nquite beyond hearing.",
        "“They are gone,” he said, “and Great Bear, Dagaeoga, and Red Coat have\nnot even known that they were here.”",
        "“In which they were lucky,” said Black Rifle.",
        "The scout awoke the three, who were much astonished to learn that such\ndanger had passed so near them. Then they considered what was best for\nthem to do next.",
