        "\n          *The author of the diary and the diary itself\n     are, of course, imaginary.  Nevertheless it is clear\n     that such persons as the writer of these notes\n     not only may, but positively must, exist in our\n     society, when we consider the circumstances in\n     the midst of which our society is formed.  I have\n     tried to expose to the view of the public more\n     distinctly than is commonly done, one of the\n     characters of the recent past.  He is one of the\n     representatives of a generation still living.  In this\n     fragment, entitled “Underground,” this person\n     introduces himself and his views, and, as it were,\n     tries to explain the causes owing to which he has\n     made his appearance and was bound to make his\n     appearance in our midst.  In the second fragment\n     there are added the actual notes of this person\n     concerning certain events in his life. —Author’s Note.",
        "\nI am a sick man. ...  I am a spiteful man.  I am an unattractive man.  I\nbelieve my liver is diseased.  However, I know nothing at all about my\ndisease, and do not know for certain what ails me.  I don’t consult a doctor\nfor it, and never have, though I have a respect for medicine and doctors. \nBesides, I am extremely superstitious, sufficiently so to respect medicine,\nanyway (I am well-educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am\nsuperstitious).  No, I refuse to consult a doctor from spite.  That you\nprobably will not understand.  Well, I understand it, though.  Of course, I\ncan’t explain who it is precisely that I am mortifying in this case by my\nspite: I am perfectly well aware that I cannot “pay out” the doctors by not\nconsulting them; I know better than anyone that by all this I am only\ninjuring myself and no one else.  But still, if I don’t consult a doctor it is\nfrom spite.  My liver is bad, well—let it get worse!",
        "I have been going on like that for a long time—twenty years.  Now I am\nforty.  I used to be in the government service, but am no longer.  I was a\nspiteful official.  I was rude and took pleasure in being so.  I did not take\nbribes, you see, so I was bound to find a recompense in that, at least.  (A\npoor jest, but I will not scratch it out.  I wrote it thinking it would sound\nvery witty; but now that I have seen myself that I only wanted to show off\nin a despicable way, I will not scratch it out on purpose!)",
        "When petitioners used to come for information to the table at which I\nsat, I used to grind my teeth at them, and felt intense enjoyment when I\nsucceeded in making anybody unhappy.  I almost did succeed.  For the\nmost part they were all timid people—of course, they were petitioners. \nBut of the uppish ones there was one officer in particular I could not\nendure.  He simply would not be humble, and clanked his sword in a\ndisgusting way.  I carried on a feud with him for eighteen months over\nthat sword.  At last I got the better of him.  He left off clanking it.  That\nhappened in my youth, though.\nBut do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?\nWhy, the whole point, the real sting of it lay in the fact that continually,\neven in the moment of the acutest spleen, I was inwardly conscious with\nshame that I was not only not a spiteful but not even an embittered man,\nthat I was simply scaring sparrows at random and amusing myself by it.  I\nmight foam at the mouth, but bring me a doll to play with, give me a cup of\ntea with sugar in it, and maybe I should be appeased.  I might even be\ngenuinely touched, though probably I should grind my teeth at myself afterwards\nand lie awake at night with shame for months after.  That was my way.",
        "I was lying when I said just now that I was a spiteful official.  I was\nlying from spite.  I was simply amusing myself with the petitioners and with\nthe officer, and in reality I never could become spiteful.  I was conscious\nevery moment in myself of many, very many elements absolutely opposite to\nthat.  I felt them positively swarming in me, these opposite elements.\nI knew that they had been swarming in me all my life and craving\nsome outlet from me, but I would not let them, would not let them,\npurposely would not let them come out.  They tormented me till I was\nashamed: they drove me to convulsions and—sickened me, at last, how\nthey sickened me!  Now, are not you fancying, gentlemen, that I am\nexpressing remorse for something now, that I am asking your forgiveness\nfor something?  I am sure you are fancying that ...  However, I assure you\nI do not care if you are. ...",
        "It was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to\nbecome anything; neither spiteful nor kind, neither a rascal nor an honest\nman, neither a hero nor an insect.  Now, I am living out my life in my\ncorner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation that an\nintelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is only the fool\nwho becomes anything.  Yes, a man in the nineteenth century must and\nmorally ought to be pre-eminently a characterless creature; a man of\ncharacter, an active man is pre-eminently a limited creature.  That is my\nconviction of forty years.  I am forty years old now, and you know forty\nyears is a whole lifetime; you know it is extreme old age.  To live longer\nthan forty years is bad manners, is vulgar, immoral.  Who does live\nbeyond forty?  Answer that, sincerely and honestly I will tell you who do:\nfools and worthless fellows.  I tell all old men that to their face, all these\nvenerable old men, all these silver-haired and reverend seniors!  I tell the\nwhole world that to its face!  I have a right to say so, for I shall go on\nliving to sixty myself.  To seventy!  To eighty!  ...  Stay, let me \ntake breath ...",
        "You imagine no doubt, gentlemen, that I want to amuse you.  You are\nmistaken in that, too.  I am by no means such a mirthful person as you\nimagine, or as you may imagine; however, irritated by all this babble (and\nI feel that you are irritated) you think fit to ask me who I am—then my\nanswer is, I am a collegiate assessor.  I was in the service that I might have\nsomething to eat (and solely for that reason), and when last year a distant\nrelation left me six thousand roubles in his will I immediately retired\nfrom the service and settled down in my corner.  I used to live in this\ncorner before, but now I have settled down in it.  My room is a wretched,\nhorrid one in the outskirts of the town.  My servant is an old country-\nwoman, ill-natured from stupidity, and, moreover, there is always a nasty\nsmell about her.  I am told that the Petersburg climate is bad for me, and\nthat with my small means it is very expensive to live in Petersburg.  I\nknow all that better than all these sage and experienced counsellors and\nmonitors. ...  But I am remaining in Petersburg; I am not going away\nfrom Petersburg!  I am not going away because ... ech!  Why, it is\nabsolutely no matter whether I am going away or not going away.",
        "But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure?",
        "Answer: Of himself.",
        "Well, so I will talk about myself.",
        "\nI want now to tell you, gentlemen, whether you care to hear it or not, why\nI could not even become an insect.  I tell you solemnly, that I have many\ntimes tried to become an insect.  But I was not equal even to that.  I swear,\ngentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness—a real thorough-going\nillness.  For man’s everyday needs, it would have been quite enough to\nhave the ordinary human consciousness, that is, half or a quarter of the\namount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of our unhappy\nnineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal ill-luck to inhabit\nPetersburg, the most theoretical and intentional town on the whole\nterrestrial globe.  (There are intentional and unintentional towns.)  It\nwould have been quite enough, for instance, to have the consciousness\nby which all so-called direct persons and men of action live.  I bet you\nthink I am writing all this from affectation, to be witty at the expense of\nmen of action; and what is more, that from ill-bred affectation, I am\nclanking a sword like my officer.  But, gentlemen, whoever can pride\nhimself on his diseases and even swagger over them?",
        "Though, after all, everyone does do that; people do pride themselves\non their diseases, and I do, may be, more than anyone.  We will not\ndispute it; my contention was absurd.  But yet I am firmly persuaded that\na great deal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is a\ndisease.  I stick to that.  Let us leave that, too, for a minute.  Tell me this:\nwhy does it happen that at the very, yes, at the very moments when I am\nmost capable of feeling every refinement of all that is “sublime and\nbeautiful,” as they used to say at one time, it would, as though of design,\nhappen to me not only to feel but to do such ugly things, such that ...\nWell, in short, actions that all, perhaps, commit; but which, as though\npurposely, occurred to me at the very time when I was most conscious\nthat they ought not to be committed.  The more conscious I was of goodness\nand of all that was “sublime and beautiful,” the more deeply I sank\ninto my mire and the more ready I was to sink in it altogether.  But the\nchief point was that all this was, as it were, not accidental in me, but as\nthough it were bound to be so.  It was as though it were my most normal\ncondition, and not in the least disease or depravity, so that at last all desire\nin me to struggle against this depravity passed.  It ended by my almost\nbelieving (perhaps actually believing) that this was perhaps my normal\ncondition.  But at first, in the beginning, what agonies I endured in that\nstruggle!  I did not believe it was the same with other people, and all my\nlife I hid this fact about myself as a secret.  I was ashamed (even now,\nperhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the point of feeling a sort of secret\nabnormal, despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on\nsome disgusting Petersburg night, acutely conscious that that day I had\ncommitted a loathsome action again, that what was done could never be\nundone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it, tearing\nand consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a sort of\nshameful accursed sweetness, and at last—into positive real enjoyment!\nYes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment!  I insist upon that.  I have spoken of\nthis because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel\nsuch enjoyment?  I will explain; the enjoyment was just from the too\nintense consciousness of one’s own degradation; it was from feeling\noneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that\nit could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you never\ncould become a different man; that even if time and faith were still left\nyou to change into something different you would most likely not wish to\nchange; or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because\nperhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into.",
        "And the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in accord\nwith the normal fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness, and\nwith the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that\nconsequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely\nnothing.  Thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness,\nthat one is not to blame in being a scoundrel; as though that were\nany consolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realise that he\nactually is a scoundrel.  But enough. ...  Ech, I have talked a lot of\nnonsense, but what have I explained?  How is enjoyment in this to be\nexplained?  But I will explain it.  I will get to the bottom of it!  That is why\nI have taken up my pen. ...",
        "I, for instance, have a great deal of AMOUR PROPRE.  I am as suspicious\nand prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf.  But upon my word I\nsometimes have had moments when if I had happened to be slapped in\nthe face I should, perhaps, have been positively glad of it.  I say, in\nearnest, that I should probably have been able to discover even in that a\npeculiar sort of enjoyment—the enjoyment, of course, of despair; but in\ndespair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one is\nvery acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one’s position.  And when\none is slapped in the face—why then the consciousness of being rubbed\ninto a pulp would positively overwhelm one.  The worst of it is, look at it\nwhich way one will, it still turns out that I was always the most to blame\nin everything.  And what is most humiliating of all, to blame for no fault\nof my own but, so to say, through the laws of nature.  In the first place, to\nblame because I am cleverer than any of the people surrounding me.  (I\nhave always considered myself cleverer than any of the people surrounding\nme, and sometimes, would you believe it, have been positively\nashamed of it.  At any rate, I have all my life, as it were, turned my eyes\naway and never could look people straight in the face.)  To blame, finally,\nbecause even if I had had magnanimity, I should only have had more\nsuffering from the sense of its uselessness.  I should certainly have never\nbeen able to do anything from being magnanimous—neither to forgive,\nfor my assailant would perhaps have slapped me from the laws of nature,\nand one cannot forgive the laws of nature; nor to forget, for even if it were\nowing to the laws of nature, it is insulting all the same.  Finally, even if I\nhad wanted to be anything but magnanimous, had desired on the\ncontrary to revenge myself on my assailant, I could not have revenged\nmyself on any one for anything because I should certainly never have\nmade up my mind to do anything, even if I had been able to.  Why\nshould I not have made up my mind?  About that in particular I want to\nsay a few words.",
        "\nWith people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for\nthemselves in general, how is it done?  Why, when they are possessed, let\nus suppose, by the feeling of revenge, then for the time there is nothing\nelse but that feeling left in their whole being.  Such a gentleman simply\ndashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull with its horns down,\nand nothing but a wall will stop him.  (By the way: facing the wall, such\ngentlemen—that is, the “direct” persons and men of action—are genuinely\nnonplussed.  For them a wall is not an evasion, as for us people who\nthink and consequently do nothing; it is not an excuse for turning aside,\nan excuse for which we are always very glad, though we scarcely believe\nin it ourselves, as a rule.  No, they are nonplussed in all sincerity.  The\nwall has for them something tranquillising, morally soothing, final—\nmaybe even something mysterious ... but of the wall later.)",
        "Well, such a direct person I regard as the real normal man, as his\ntender mother nature wished to see him when she graciously brought him\ninto being on the earth.  I envy such a man till I am green in the face.  He\nis stupid.  I am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal man should be\nstupid, how do you know?  Perhaps it is very beautiful, in fact.  And I am\nthe more persuaded of that suspicion, if one can call it so, by the fact that\nif you take, for instance, the antithesis of the normal man, that is, the\nman of acute consciousness, who has come, of course, not out of the lap\nof nature but out of a retort (this is almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I\nsuspect this, too), this retort-made man is sometimes so nonplussed in\nthe presence of his antithesis that with all his exaggerated consciousness\nhe genuinely thinks of himself as a mouse and not a man.  It may be an\nacutely conscious mouse, yet it is a mouse, while the other is a man, and\ntherefore, et caetera, et caetera.  And the worst of it is, he himself, his very\nown self, looks on himself as a mouse; no one asks him to do so; and that\nis an important point.  Now let us look at this mouse in action.  Let us\nsuppose, for instance, that it feels insulted, too (and it almost always does\nfeel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too.  There may even be a\ngreater accumulation of spite in it than in L’HOMME DE LA NATURE ET DE LA\nVERITE.  The base and nasty desire to vent that spite on its assailant rankles\nperhaps even more nastily in it than in L’HOMME DE LA NATURE ET DE LA\nVERITE.  For through his innate stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge\nas justice pure and simple; while in consequence of his acute consciousness\nthe mouse does not believe in the justice of it.  To come at last to the\ndeed itself, to the very act of revenge.  Apart from the one fundamental\nnastiness the luckless mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other\nnastinesses in the form of doubts and questions, adds to the one question\nso many unsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort\nof fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of the\ncontempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand solemnly\nabout it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it till their healthy sides\nache.  Of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss all that with a wave\nof its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt in which it does not\neven itself believe, creep ignominiously into its mouse-hole.  There in its\nnasty, stinking, underground home our insulted, crushed and ridiculed\nmouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold, malignant and, above all,\neverlasting spite.  For forty years together it will remember its injury down\nto the smallest, most ignominious details, and every time will add, of\nitself, details still more ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting\nitself with its own imagination.  It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings,\nbut yet it will recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will\ninvent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things\nmight happen, and will forgive nothing.  Maybe it will begin to revenge\nitself, too, but, as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind the\nstove, incognito, without believing either in its own right to vengeance,\nor in the success of its revenge, knowing that from all its efforts at revenge\nit will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom it revenges itself,\nwhile he, I daresay, will not even scratch himself.  On its deathbed it will\nrecall it all over again, with interest accumulated over all the years\nand ...",
        "But it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in that\nconscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for forty years,\nin that acutely recognised and yet partly doubtful hopelessness of one’s\nposition, in that hell of unsatisfied desires turned inward, in that fever of\noscillations, of resolutions determined for ever and repented of again a\nminute later—that the savour of that strange enjoyment of which I have\nspoken lies.  It is so subtle, so difficult of analysis, that persons who are a\nlittle limited, or even simply persons of strong nerves, will not understand\na single atom of it.  “Possibly,” you will add on your own account\nwith a grin, “people will not understand it either who have never received\na slap in the face,” and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too,\nperhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and so I\nspeak as one who knows.  I bet that you are thinking that.  But set your\nminds at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the face, though it\nis absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may think about it. \nPossibly, I even regret, myself, that I have given so few slaps in the face\nduring my life.  But enough ... not another word on that subject of such\nextreme interest to you.",
        "I will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do\nnot understand a certain refinement of enjoyment.  Though in certain\ncircumstances these gentlemen bellow their loudest like bulls, though\nthis, let us suppose, does them the greatest credit, yet, as I have said\nalready, confronted with the impossible they subside at once.  The impossible\nmeans the stone wall!  What stone wall?  Why, of course, the laws of\nnature, the deductions of natural science, mathematics.  As soon as they\nprove to you, for instance, that you are descended from a monkey, then it\nis no use scowling, accept it for a fact.  When they prove to you that in\nreality one drop of your own fat must be dearer to you than a hundred\nthousand of your fellow-creatures, and that this conclusion is the final\nsolution of all so-called virtues and duties and all such prejudices and\nfancies, then you have just to accept it, there is no help for it, for twice\ntwo is a law of mathematics.  Just try refuting it.",
        "“Upon my word, they will shout at you, it is no use protesting: it is a\ncase of twice two makes four!  Nature does not ask your permission, she\nhas nothing to do with your wishes, and whether you like her laws or\ndislike them, you are bound to accept her as she is, and consequently all\nher conclusions.  A wall, you see, is a wall ... and so on, and so on.”",
        "Merciful Heavens!  but what do I care for the laws of nature and\narithmetic, when, for some reason I dislike those laws and the fact that\ntwice two makes four?  Of course I cannot break through the wall by\nbattering my head against it if I really have not the strength to knock it\ndown, but I am not going to be reconciled to it simply because it is a stone\nwall and I have not the strength.",
        "As though such a stone wall really were a consolation, and really did\ncontain some word of conciliation, simply because it is as true as twice\ntwo makes four.  Oh, absurdity of absurdities!  How much better it is to\nunderstand it all, to recognise it all, all the impossibilities and the stone\nwall; not to be reconciled to one of those impossibilities and stone walls if\nit disgusts you to be reconciled to it; by the way of the most inevitable,\nlogical combinations to reach the most revolting conclusions on the\neverlasting theme, that even for the stone wall you are yourself somehow\nto blame, though again it is as clear as day you are not to blame in the\nleast, and therefore grinding your teeth in silent impotence to sink into\nluxurious inertia, brooding on the fact that there is no one even for you to\nfeel vindictive against, that you have not, and perhaps never will have, an\nobject for your spite, that it is a sleight of hand, a bit of juggling, a card-\nsharper’s trick, that it is simply a mess, no knowing what and no knowing\nwho, but in spite of all these uncertainties and jugglings, still there is an\nache in you, and the more you do not know, the worse the ache.",
        "\n\"Ha, ha, ha!  You will be finding enjoyment in toothache next,” you cry,\nwith a laugh.",
        "“Well, even in toothache there is enjoyment,” I answer.  I had toothache\nfor a whole month and I know there is.  In that case, of course,\npeople are not spiteful in silence, but moan; but they are not candid\nmoans, they are malignant moans, and the malignancy is the whole\npoint.  The enjoyment of the sufferer finds expression in those moans; if\nhe did not feel enjoyment in them he would not moan.  It is a good\nexample, gentlemen, and I will develop it.  Those moans express in the\nfirst place all the aimlessness of your pain, which is so humiliating to\nyour consciousness; the whole legal system of nature on which you spit\ndisdainfully, of course, but from which you suffer all the same while she\ndoes not.  They express the consciousness that you have no enemy to\npunish, but that you have pain; the consciousness that in spite of all\npossible Wagenheims you are in complete slavery to your teeth; that if\nsomeone wishes it, your teeth will leave off aching, and if he does not,\nthey will go on aching another three months; and that finally if you are\nstill contumacious and still protest, all that is left you for your own\ngratification is to thrash yourself or beat your wall with your fist as hard as\nyou can, and absolutely nothing more.  Well, these mortal insults, these\njeers on the part of someone unknown, end at last in an enjoyment which\nsometimes reaches the highest degree of voluptuousness.  I ask you,\ngentlemen, listen sometimes to the moans of an educated man of the\nnineteenth century suffering from toothache, on the second or third day\nof the attack, when he is beginning to moan, not as he moaned on the\nfirst day, that is, not simply because he has toothache, not just as any\ncoarse peasant, but as a man affected by progress and European civilisation,\na man who is “divorced from the soil and the national elements,” as\nthey express it now-a-days.  His moans become nasty, disgustingly malignant,\nand go on for whole days and nights.  And of course he knows\nhimself that he is doing himself no sort of good with his moans; he knows\nbetter than anyone that he is only lacerating and harassing himself and\nothers for nothing; he knows that even the audience before whom he is\nmaking his efforts, and his whole family, listen to him with loathing, do\nnot put a ha’porth of faith in him, and inwardly understand that he might\nmoan differently, more simply, without trills and flourishes, and that he is\nonly amusing himself like that from ill-humour, from malignancy.  Well,\nin all these recognitions and disgraces it is that there lies a voluptuous\npleasure.  As though he would say: “I am worrying you, I am lacerating\nyour hearts, I am keeping everyone in the house awake.  Well, stay awake\nthen, you, too, feel every minute that I have toothache.  I am not a hero\nto you now, as I tried to seem before, but simply a nasty person, an\nimpostor.  Well, so be it, then!  I am very glad that you see through me.  It\nis nasty for you to hear my despicable moans: well, let it be nasty; here I\nwill let you have a nastier flourish in a minute. ...”  You do not\nunderstand even now, gentlemen?  No, it seems our  development and our\nconsciousness must go further to understand all the intricacies of this\npleasure.  You laugh?  Delighted.  My jests, gentlemen, are of course in\nbad taste, jerky, involved, lacking self-confidence.  But of course that is\nbecause I do not respect myself.  Can a man of perception respect himself\nat all?",
        "\nCome, can a man who attempts to find enjoyment in the very feeling of\nhis own degradation possibly have a spark of respect for himself?  I am not\nsaying this now from any mawkish kind of remorse.  And, indeed, I could\nnever endure saying, “Forgive me, Papa, I won’t do it again,” not because\nI am incapable of saying that—on the contrary, perhaps just because I\nhave been too capable of it, and in what a way, too.  As though of design I\nused to get into trouble in cases when I was not to blame in any way.  That\nwas the nastiest part of it.  At the same time I was genuinely touched and\npenitent, I used to shed tears and, of course, deceived myself, though I\nwas not acting in the least and there was a sick feeling in my heart at the\ntime. ...  For that one could not blame even the laws of nature, though\nthe laws of nature have continually all my life offended me more than\nanything.  It is loathsome to remember it all, but it was loathsome even\nthen.  Of course, a minute or so later I would realise wrathfully that it was\nall a lie, a revolting lie, an affected lie, that is, all this penitence, this\nemotion, these vows of reform.  You will ask why did I worry myself with\nsuch antics: answer, because it was very dull to sit with one’s hands\nfolded, and so one began cutting capers.  That is really it.  Observe\nyourselves more carefully, gentlemen, then you will understand that it is\nso. I invented adventures for myself and made up a life, so as at least to\nlive in some way.  How many times it has happened to me—well, for\ninstance, to take offence simply on purpose, for nothing; and one knows\noneself, of course, that one is offended at nothing; that one is putting it\non, but yet one brings oneself at last to the point of being really offended. \nAll my life I have had an impulse to play such pranks, so that in the end I\ncould not control it in myself.  Another time, twice, in fact, I tried hard to\nbe in love.  I suffered, too, gentlemen, I assure you.  In the depth of my\nheart there was no faith in my suffering, only a faint stir of mockery, but\nyet I did suffer, and in the real, orthodox way; I was jealous, beside myself\n... and it was all from ENNUI, gentlemen, all from ENNUI; inertia overcame\nme.  You know the direct, legitimate fruit of consciousness is\ninertia, that is, conscious sitting-with-the-hands-folded.  I have referred\nto this already.  I repeat, I repeat with emphasis: all “direct” persons and\nmen of action are active just because they are stupid and limited.  How\nexplain that?  I will tell you: in consequence of their limitation they take\nimmediate and secondary causes for primary ones, and in that way\npersuade themselves more quickly and easily than other people do that\nthey have found an infallible foundation for their activity, and their\nminds are at ease and you know that is the chief thing.  To begin to act,\nyou know, you must first have your mind completely at ease and no trace\nof doubt left in it.  Why, how am I, for example, to set my mind at rest?\nWhere are the primary causes on which I am to build?  Where are my\nfoundations?  Where am I to get them from?  I exercise myself in reflection,\nand consequently with me every primary cause at once draws after\nitself another still more primary, and so on to infinity.  That is just the\nessence of every sort of consciousness and reflection.  It must be a case of\nthe laws of nature again.  What is the result of it in the end?  Why, just the\nsame.  Remember I spoke just now of vengeance.  (I am sure you did not\ntake it in.)  I said that a man revenges himself because he sees justice in it. \nTherefore he has found a primary cause, that is, justice.  And so he is at\nrest on all sides, and consequently he carries out his revenge calmly and\nsuccessfully, being persuaded that he is doing a just and honest thing.  But\nI see no justice in it, I find no sort of virtue in it either, and consequently\nif I attempt to revenge myself, it is only out of spite.  Spite, of course,\nmight overcome everything, all my doubts, and so might serve quite\nsuccessfully in place of a primary cause, precisely because it is not a\ncause.  But what is to be done if I have not even spite (I began with that\njust now, you know).  In consequence again of those accursed laws of\nconsciousness, anger in me is subject to chemical disintegration.  You\nlook into it, the object flies off into air, your reasons evaporate, the\ncriminal is not to be found, the wrong becomes not a wrong but a\nphantom, something like the toothache, for which no one is to blame,\nand consequently there is only the same outlet left again—that is, to beat\nthe wall as hard as you can.  So you give it up with a wave of the hand\nbecause you have not found a fundamental cause.  And try letting yourself\nbe carried away by your feelings, blindly, without reflection, without a\nprimary cause, repelling consciousness at least for a time; hate or love, if\nonly not to sit with your hands folded.  The day after tomorrow, at the\nlatest, you will begin despising yourself for having knowingly deceived\nyourself.  Result: a soap-bubble and inertia.  Oh, gentlemen, do you\nknow, perhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my\nlife I have been able neither to begin nor to finish anything.  Granted I am\na babbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of us.  But what is to be\ndone if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble,\nthat is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?",
        "\nOh, if I had done nothing simply from laziness!  Heavens, how I should\nhave respected myself, then.  I should have respected myself because I\nshould at least have been capable of being lazy; there would at least have\nbeen one quality, as it were, positive in me, in which I could have believed\nmyself.  Question:  What is he?  Answer:  A sluggard; how very pleasant it\nwould have been to hear that of oneself!  It would mean that I was positively\ndefined, it would mean that there was something to say about me. \n\"Sluggard\"—why, it is a calling and vocation, it is a career.  Do not jest, it\nis so.  I should then be a member of the best club by right, and should find\nmy occupation in continually respecting myself.  I knew a gentleman who\nprided himself all his life on being a connoisseur of Lafitte.  He considered\nthis as his positive virtue, and never doubted himself.  He died, not simply\nwith a tranquil, but with a triumphant conscience, and he was quite right,\ntoo.  Then I should have chosen a career for myself, I should have been a\nsluggard and a glutton, not a simple one, but, for instance, one with\nsympathies for everything sublime and beautiful.  How do you like that?  I\nhave long had visions of it.  That “sublime and beautiful” weighs heavily\non my mind at forty But that is at forty; then—oh, then it would have\nbeen different!  I should have found for myself a form of activity in keeping\nwith it, to be precise, drinking to the health of everything “sublime and\nbeautiful.”  I should have snatched at every opportunity to drop a tear into\nmy glass and then to drain it to all that is “sublime and beautiful.”  I should\nthen have turned everything into the sublime and the beautiful; in the\nnastiest, unquestionable trash, I should have sought out the sublime and\nthe beautiful.  I should have exuded tears like a wet sponge.  An artist, for\ninstance, paints a picture worthy of Gay.  At once I drink to the health of\nthe artist who painted the picture worthy of Gay, because I love all that is\n\"sublime and beautiful.”  An author has written AS YOU WILL: at once I drink\nto the health of “anyone you will” because I love all that is “sublime and\nbeautiful.”",
        "I should claim respect for doing so.  I should persecute anyone who\nwould not show me respect.  I should live at ease, I should die with\ndignity, why, it is charming, perfectly charming!  And what a good round\nbelly I should have grown, what a treble chin I should have established,\nwhat a ruby nose I should have coloured for myself, so that everyone\nwould have said, looking at me: “Here is an asset!  Here is something real\nand solid!”  And, say what you like, it is very agreeable to hear such\nremarks about oneself in this negative age.",
        "\nBut these are all golden dreams.  Oh, tell me, who was it first announced,\nwho was it first proclaimed, that man only does nasty things because he\ndoes not know his own interests; and that if he were enlightened, if his\neyes were opened to his real normal interests, man would at once cease to\ndo nasty things, would at once become good and noble because, being\nenlightened and understanding his real advantage, he would see his own\nadvantage in the good and nothing else, and we all know that not one\nman can, consciously, act against his own interests, consequently, so to\nsay, through necessity, he would begin doing good?  Oh, the babe!  Oh,\nthe pure, innocent child!  Why, in the first place, when in all these\nthousands of years has there been a time when man has acted only from\nhis own interest?  What is to be done with the millions of facts that bear\nwitness that men, CONSCIOUSLY, that is fully understanding their real\ninterests, have left them in the background and have rushed headlong on\nanother path, to meet peril and danger, compelled to this course by\nnobody and by nothing, but, as it were, simply disliking the beaten track,\nand have obstinately, wilfully, struck out another difficult, absurd way,\nseeking it almost in the darkness.  So, I suppose, this obstinacy and\nperversity were pleasanter to them than any advantage. ...  Advantage!\nWhat is advantage?  And will you take it upon yourself to define with\nperfect accuracy in what the advantage of man consists?  And what if it so\nhappens that a man’s advantage, SOMETIMES, not only may, but even\nmust, consist in his desiring in certain cases what is harmful to himself\nand not advantageous.  And if so, if there can be such a case, the whole\nprinciple falls into dust.  What do you think—are there such cases?  You\nlaugh; laugh away, gentlemen, but only answer me: have man’s advantages\nbeen reckoned up with perfect certainty?  Are there not some which not\nonly have not been included but cannot possibly be included under any\nclassification?  You see, you gentlemen have, to the best of my\nknowledge, taken your whole register of human advantages from the\naverages of statistical figures and politico-economical formulas.  Your\nadvantages are prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace—and so on, and so\non. So that the man who should, for instance, go openly and knowingly\nin opposition to all that list would to your thinking, and indeed mine,\ntoo, of course, be an obscurantist or an absolute madman: would not he?\nBut, you know, this is what is surprising: why does it so happen that all\nthese statisticians, sages and lovers of humanity, when they reckon up\nhuman advantages invariably leave out one?  They don’t even take it into\ntheir reckoning in the form in which it should be taken, and the whole\nreckoning depends upon that.  It would be no greater matter, they would\nsimply have to take it, this advantage, and add it to the list.  But the\ntrouble is, that this strange advantage does not fall under any classification\nand is not in place in any list.  I have a friend for instance ...  Ech!\ngentlemen, but of course he is your friend, too; and indeed there is no\none, no one to whom he is not a friend!  When he prepares for any\nundertaking this gentleman immediately explains to you, elegantly and\nclearly, exactly how he must act in accordance with the laws of reason and\ntruth.  What is more, he will talk to you with excitement and passion of\nthe true normal interests of man; with irony he will upbraid the short-\nsighted fools who do not understand their own interests, nor the true\nsignificance of virtue; and, within a quarter of an hour, without any\nsudden outside provocation, but simply through something inside him\nwhich is stronger than all his interests, he will go off on quite a different\ntack—that is, act in direct opposition to what he has just been saying\nabout himself, in opposition to the laws of reason, in opposition to his\nown advantage, in fact in opposition to everything ...  I warn you that\nmy friend is a compound personality and therefore it is difficult to blame\nhim as an individual.  The fact is, gentlemen, it seems there must really\nexist something that is dearer to almost every man than his greatest\nadvantages, or (not to be illogical) there is a most advantageous advantage\n(the very one omitted of which we spoke just now) which is more\nimportant and more advantageous than all other advantages, for the sake\nof which a man if necessary is ready to act in opposition to all laws; that\nis, in opposition to reason, honour, peace, prosperity—in fact, in opposition\nto all those excellent and useful things if only he can attain that\nfundamental, most advantageous advantage which is dearer to him\nthan all.  “Yes, but it’s advantage all the same,” you will retort.  But excuse\nme, I’ll make the point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. \nWhat matters is, that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that\nit breaks down all our classifications, and continually shatters every\nsystem constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind.  In\nfact, it upsets everything.  But before I mention this advantage to you, I\nwant to compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare\nthat all these fine systems, all these theories for explaining to mankind\ntheir real normal interests, in order that inevitably striving to pursue\nthese interests they may at once become good and noble—are, in my\nopinion, so far, mere logical exercises!  Yes, logical exercises.  Why, to\nmaintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of the\npursuit of his own advantage is to my mind almost the same thing ...\nas to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through civilisation\nmankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty and less\nfitted for warfare.  Logically it does seem to follow from his arguments. \nBut man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that\nhe is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is ready to deny the\nevidence of his senses only to justify his logic.  I take this example\nbecause it is the most glaring instance of it.  Only look about you: blood\nis being spilt in streams, and in the merriest way, as though it were\nchampagne.  Take the whole of the nineteenth century in which Buckle\nlived.  Take Napoleon—the Great and also the present one.  Take North\nAmerica—the eternal union.  Take the farce of Schleswig-Holstein ....\nAnd what is it that civilisation softens in us?  The only gain of civilisation\nfor mankind is the greater capacity for variety of sensations—and\nabsolutely nothing more.  And through the development of this many-\nsidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed.  In fact,\nthis has already happened to him.  Have you noticed that it is the most\ncivilised gentlemen who have been the subtlest slaughterers, to whom\nthe Attilas and Stenka Razins could not hold a candle, and if they are\nnot so conspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka Razins it is simply because\nthey are so often met with, are so ordinary and have become so familiar\nto us.  In any case civilisation has made mankind if not more bloodthirsty,\nat least more vilely, more loathsomely bloodthirsty.  In old days\nhe saw justice in bloodshed and with his conscience at peace exterminated\nthose he thought proper.  Now we do think bloodshed abominable\nand yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy than ever. \nWhich is worse?  Decide that for yourselves.  They say that Cleopatra\n(excuse an instance from Roman history) was fond of sticking gold pins\ninto her slave-girls’ breasts and derived gratification from their screams\nand writhings.  You will say that that was in the comparatively barbarous\ntimes; that these are barbarous times too, because also, comparatively\nspeaking, pins are stuck in even now; that though man has now learned\nto see more clearly than in barbarous ages, he is still far from having\nlearnt to act as reason and science would dictate.  But yet you are fully\nconvinced that he will be sure to learn when he gets rid of certain old\nbad habits, and when common sense and science have completely\nre-educated human nature and turned it in a normal direction.  You are\nconfident that then man will cease from INTENTIONAL error and will, so to\nsay, be compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests. \nThat is not all; then, you say, science itself will teach man (though to my\nmind it’s a superfluous luxury) that he never has really had any caprice\nor will of his own, and that he himself is something of the nature of a\npiano-key or the stop of an organ, and that there are, besides, things\ncalled the laws of nature; so that everything he does is not done by his\nwilling it, but is done of itself, by the laws of nature.  Consequently we\nhave only to discover these laws of nature, and man will no longer have\nto answer for his actions and life will become exceedingly easy for him. \nAll human actions will then, of course, be tabulated according to these\nlaws, mathematically, like tables of logarithms up to 108,000, and\nentered in an index; or, better still, there would be published certain\nedifying works of the nature of encyclopaedic lexicons, in which everything\nwill be so clearly calculated and explained that there will be no\nmore incidents or adventures in the world.",
        "Then—this is all what you say—new economic relations will be\nestablished, all ready-made and worked out with mathematical exactitude,\nso that every possible question will vanish in the twinkling of an eye,\nsimply because every possible answer to it will be provided.  Then\nthe “Palace of Crystal” will be built.  Then ...  In fact, those will be\nhalcyon days.  Of course there is no guaranteeing (this is my comment)\nthat it will not be, for instance, frightfully dull then (for what will one\nhave to do when everything will be calculated and tabulated), but on the\nother hand everything will be extraordinarily rational.  Of course boredom\nmay lead you to anything.  It is boredom sets one sticking golden\npins into people, but all that would not matter.  What is bad (this is my\ncomment again) is that I dare say people will be thankful for the gold\npins then.  Man is stupid, you know, phenomenally stupid; or rather he is\nnot at all stupid, but he is so ungrateful that you could not find another\nlike him in all creation.  I, for instance, would not be in the least\nsurprised if all of a sudden, A PROPOS of nothing, in the midst of general\nprosperity a gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a reactionary and\nironical, countenance were to arise and, putting his arms akimbo, say to\nus all: “I say, gentleman, hadn’t we better kick over the whole show and\nscatter rationalism to the winds, simply to send these logarithms to the\ndevil, and to enable us to live once more at our own sweet foolish will!\"\nThat again would not matter, but what is annoying is that he would be\nsure to find followers—such is the nature of man.  And all that for the\nmost foolish reason, which, one would think, was hardly worth mentioning:\nthat is, that man everywhere and at all times, whoever he may\nbe, has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as his reason and\nadvantage dictated.  And one may choose what is contrary to one’s own\ninterests, and sometimes one POSITIVELY OUGHT (that is my idea).  One’s\nown free unfettered choice, one’s own caprice, however wild it may be,\none’s own fancy worked up at times to frenzy—is that very “most\nadvantageous advantage” which we have overlooked, which comes\nunder no classification and against which all systems and theories are\ncontinually being shattered to atoms.  And how do these wiseacres know\nthat man wants a normal, a virtuous choice?  What has made them\nconceive that man must want a rationally advantageous choice?  What\nman wants is simply INDEPENDENT choice, whatever that independence\nmay cost and wherever it may lead.  And choice, of course, the devil\nonly knows what choice.",
        "\n\"Ha! ha! ha!  But you know there is no such thing as choice in reality, say\nwhat you like,” you will interpose with a chuckle.  “Science has succeeded\nin so far analysing man that we know already that choice and\nwhat is called freedom of will is nothing else than—”",
        "Stay, gentlemen, I meant to begin with that myself I confess, I was\nrather frightened.  I was just going to say that the devil only knows what\nchoice depends on, and that perhaps that was a very good thing, but I\nremembered the teaching of science ... and pulled myself up.  And here\nyou have begun upon it.  Indeed, if there really is some day discovered a\nformula for all our desires and caprices—that is, an explanation of what\nthey depend upon, by what laws they arise, how they develop, what they\nare aiming at in one case and in another and so on, that is a real\nmathematical formula—then, most likely, man will at once cease to feel\ndesire, indeed, he will be certain to.  For who would want to choose by\nrule?  Besides, he will at once be transformed from a human being into\nan organ-stop or something of the sort; for what is a man without desires,\nwithout free will and without choice, if not a stop in an organ?  What do\nyou think?  Let us reckon the chances—can such a thing happen or not?",
        "“H’m!” you decide.  “Our choice is usually mistaken from a false view\nof our advantage.  We sometimes choose absolute nonsense because in\nour foolishness we see in that nonsense the easiest means for attaining a\nsupposed advantage.  But when all that is explained and worked out on\npaper (which is perfectly possible, for it is contemptible and senseless to\nsuppose that some laws of nature man will never understand), then\ncertainly so-called desires will no longer exist.  For if a desire should come\ninto conflict with reason we shall then reason and not desire, because it\nwill be impossible retaining our reason to be SENSELESS in our desires, and\nin that way knowingly act against reason and desire to injure ourselves. \nAnd as all choice and reasoning can be really calculated—because there\nwill some day be discovered the laws of our so-called free will—so, joking\napart, there may one day be something like a table constructed of them,\nso that we really shall choose in accordance with it.  If, for instance, some\nday they calculate and prove to me that I made a long nose at someone\nbecause I could not help making a long nose at him and that I had to do it\nin that particular way, what FREEDOM is left me, especially if I am a learned\nman and have taken my degree somewhere?  Then I should be able to\ncalculate my whole life for thirty years beforehand.  In short, if this could\nbe arranged there would be nothing left for us to do; anyway, we should\nhave to understand that.  And, in fact, we ought unwearyingly to repeat to\nourselves that at such and such a time and in such and such circumstances\nnature does not ask our leave; that we have got to take her as she is\nand not fashion her to suit our fancy, and if we really aspire to formulas\nand tables of rules, and well, even ... to the chemical retort, there’s no\nhelp for it, we must accept the retort too, or else it will be accepted\nwithout our consent ....”",
        "Yes, but here I come to a stop!  Gentlemen, you must excuse me for being\nover-philosophical; it’s the result of forty years underground!  Allow me to\nindulge my fancy.  You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing, there’s\nno disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only\nthe rational side of man’s nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole\nlife, that is, of the whole human life including reason and all the impulses.\nAnd although our life, in this manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet\nit is life and not simply extracting square roots.  Here I, for instance,\nquite naturally want to live, in order to satisfy all my capacities for\nlife, and not simply my capacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one\ntwentieth of my capacity for life.  What does reason know?  Reason only\nknows what it has succeeded in learning (some things, perhaps, it will\nnever learn; this is a poor comfort, but why not say so frankly?) and\nhuman nature acts as a whole, with everything that is in it, consciously\nor unconsciously, and, even if it goes wrong, it lives.  I suspect,\ngentlemen, that you are looking at me with compassion; you tell me\nagain that an enlightened and developed man, such, in short, as the\nfuture man will be, cannot consciously desire anything disadvantageous\nto himself, that that can be proved mathematically.  I thoroughly agree, it\ncan—by mathematics.  But I repeat for the hundredth time, there is one\ncase, one only, when man may consciously, purposely, desire what is\ninjurious to himself, what is stupid, very stupid—simply in order to have\nthe right to desire for himself even what is very stupid and not to be\nbound by an obligation to desire only what is sensible.  Of course, this\nvery stupid thing, this caprice of ours, may be in reality, gentlemen,\nmore advantageous for us than anything else on earth, especially in\ncertain cases.  And in particular it may be more advantageous than any\nadvantage even when it does us obvious harm, and contradicts the\nsoundest conclusions of our reason concerning our advantage—for in\nany circumstances it preserves for us what is most precious and most\nimportant—that is, our personality, our individuality.  Some, you see,\nmaintain that this really is the most precious thing for mankind; choice\ncan, of course, if it chooses, be in agreement with reason; and especially\nif this be not abused but kept within bounds.  It is profitable and sometimes\neven praiseworthy.  But very often, and even most often, choice is\nutterly and stubbornly opposed to reason ... and ... and ... do you\nknow that that, too, is profitable, sometimes even praiseworthy?  Gentlemen,\nlet us suppose that man is not stupid.  (Indeed one cannot refuse to\nsuppose that, if only from the one consideration, that, if man is stupid,\nthen who is wise?)  But if he is not stupid, he is monstrously ungrateful!\nPhenomenally ungrateful.  In fact, I believe that the best definition of\nman is the ungrateful biped.  But that is not all, that is not his worst\ndefect; his worst defect is his perpetual moral obliquity, perpetual—from\nthe days of the Flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period.  Moral obliquity\nand consequently lack of good sense; for it has long been accepted that\nlack of good sense is due to no other cause than moral obliquity.  Put it to\nthe test and cast your eyes upon the history of mankind.  What will you\nsee?  Is it a grand spectacle?  Grand, if you like.  Take the Colossus of\nRhodes, for instance, that’s worth something.  With good reason Mr.\nAnaevsky testifies of it that some say that it is the work of man’s hands,\nwhile others maintain that it has been created by nature herself.  Is it\nmany-coloured?  May be it is many-coloured, too: if one takes the dress\nuniforms, military and civilian, of all peoples in all ages—that alone is\nworth something, and if you take the undress uniforms you will never get\nto the end of it; no historian would be equal to the job.  Is it monotonous?\nMay be it’s monotonous too: it’s fighting and fighting; they are fighting\nnow, they fought first and they fought last—you will admit, that it is\nalmost too monotonous.  In short, one may say anything about the history\nof the world—anything that might enter the most disordered imagination.\nThe only thing one can’t say is that it’s rational.  The very word sticks\nin one’s throat.  And, indeed, this is the odd thing that is continually\nhappening: there are continually turning up in life moral and rational\npersons, sages and lovers of humanity who make it their object to live all\ntheir lives as morally and rationally as possible, to be, so to speak, a light\nto their neighbours simply in order to show them that it is possible to live\nmorally and rationally in this world.  And yet we all know that those very\npeople sooner or later have been false to themselves, playing some queer\ntrick, often a most unseemly one.  Now I ask you: what can be expected of\nman since he is a being endowed with strange qualities?  Shower upon\nhim every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that\nnothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him\neconomic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but\nsleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and\neven then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some\nnasty trick.  He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire\nthe most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to\nintroduce into all this positive good sense his fatal fantastic element.  It is\njust his fantastic dreams, his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain,\nsimply in order to prove to himself—as though that were so necessary—\nthat men still are men and not the keys of a piano, which the laws of\nnature threaten to control so completely that soon one will be able to\ndesire nothing but by the calendar.  And that is not all: even if man really\nwere nothing but a piano-key, even if this were proved to him by natural\nscience and mathematics, even then he would not become reasonable,\nbut would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude,\nsimply to gain his point.  And if he does not find means he will contrive\ndestruction and chaos, will contrive sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his\npoint!  He will launch a curse upon the world, and as only man can curse\n(it is his privilege, the primary distinction between him and other animals),\nmay be by his curse alone he will attain his object—that is,\nconvince himself that he is a man and not a piano-key!  If you say that all\nthis, too, can be calculated and tabulated—chaos and darkness and\ncurses, so that the mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would\nstop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go\nmad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point!  I believe in it, I\nanswer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing\nbut proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key!\nIt may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by cannibalism!  And this being\nso, can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off, and\nthat desire still depends on something we don’t know?",
        "You will scream at me (that is, if you condescend to do so) that no one\nis touching my free will, that all they are concerned with is that my will\nshould of itself, of its own free will, coincide with my own normal\ninterests, with the laws of nature and arithmetic.",
        "Good heavens, gentlemen, what sort of free will is left when we\ncome to tabulation and arithmetic, when it will all be a case of twice\ntwo make four?  Twice two makes four without my will.  As if free will\nmeant that!",
        "\nGentlemen, I am joking, and I know myself that my jokes are not\nbrilliant, but you know one can take everything as a joke.  I am, perhaps,\njesting against the grain.  Gentlemen, I am tormented by questions;\nanswer them for me.  You, for instance, want to cure men of their old\nhabits and reform their will in accordance with science and good sense. \nBut how do you know, not only that it is possible, but also that it is\nDESIRABLE to reform man in that way?  And what leads you to the conclusion\nthat man’s inclinations NEED reforming?  In short, how do you know\nthat such a reformation will be a benefit to man?  And to go to the root of\nthe matter, why are you so positively convinced that not to act against his\nreal normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions of reason and arithmetic\nis certainly always advantageous for man and must always be a law\nfor mankind?  So far, you know, this is only your supposition.  It may be\nthe law of logic, but not the law of humanity.  You think, gentlemen,\nperhaps that I am mad?  Allow me to defend myself.  I agree that man is\npre-eminently a creative animal, predestined to strive consciously for an\nobject and to engage in engineering—that is, incessantly and eternally to\nmake new roads, WHEREVER THEY MAY LEAD.  But the reason why he wants\nsometimes to go off at a tangent may just be that he is PREDESTINED to make\nthe road, and perhaps, too, that however stupid the “direct” practical\nman may be, the thought sometimes will occur to him that the road\nalmost always does lead SOMEWHERE, and that the destination it leads to is\nless important than the process of making it, and that the chief thing is to\nsave the well-conducted child from despising engineering, and so giving\nway to the fatal idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all the\nvices.  Man likes to make roads and to create, that is a fact beyond dispute. \nBut why has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos also?  Tell\nme that!  But on that point I want to say a couple of words myself.  May it\nnot be that he loves chaos and destruction (there can be no disputing that\nhe does sometimes love it) because he is instinctively afraid of attaining\nhis object and completing the edifice he is constructing?  Who knows,\nperhaps he only loves that edifice from a distance, and is by no means in\nlove with it at close quarters; perhaps he only loves building it and does\nnot want to live in it, but will leave it, when completed, for the use of\nLES ANIMAUX DOMESTIQUES—such as the ants, the sheep, and so on.  Now the\nants have quite a different taste.  They have a marvellous edifice of that\npattern which endures for ever—the ant-heap.",
        "With the ant-heap the respectable race of ants began and with the ant-\nheap they will probably end, which does the greatest credit to their\nperseverance and good sense.  But man is a frivolous and incongruous\ncreature, and perhaps, like a chess player, loves the process of the game,\nnot the end of it.  And who knows (there is no saying with certainty),\nperhaps the only goal on earth to which mankind is striving lies in this\nincessant process of attaining, in other words, in life itself, and not in the\nthing to be attained, which must always be expressed as a formula, as\npositive as twice two makes four, and such positiveness is not life,\ngentlemen, but is the beginning of death.  Anyway, man has always been\nafraid of this mathematical certainty, and I am afraid of it now.  Granted\nthat man does nothing but seek that mathematical certainty, he traverses\noceans, sacrifices his life in the quest, but to succeed, really to find it,\ndreads, I assure you.  He feels that when he has found it there will be\nnothing for him to look for.  When workmen have finished their work\nthey do at least receive their pay, they go to the tavern, then they are taken\nto the police-station—and there is occupation for a week.  But where can\nman go?  Anyway, one can observe a certain awkwardness about him\nwhen he has attained such objects.  He loves the process of attaining, but\ndoes not quite like to have attained, and that, of course, is very absurd.  In\nfact, man is a comical creature; there seems to be a kind of jest in it all. \nBut yet mathematical certainty is after all, something insufferable.  Twice\ntwo makes four seems to me simply a piece of insolence.  Twice two\nmakes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring your\npath and spitting.  I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing,\nbut if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes\na very charming thing too.",
        "And why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the\nnormal and the positive—in other words, only what is conducive to\nwelfare—is for the advantage of man?  Is not reason in error as regards\nadvantage?  Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being?\nPerhaps he is just as fond of suffering?  Perhaps suffering is just as great a\nbenefit to him as well-being?  Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately,\nin love with suffering, and that is a fact.  There is no need to appeal\nto universal history to prove that; only ask yourself, if you are a man and\nhave lived at all.  As far as my personal opinion is concerned, to care only\nfor well-being seems to me positively ill-bred.  Whether it’s good or bad, it\nis sometimes very pleasant, too, to smash things.  I hold no brief for\nsuffering nor for well-being either.  I am standing for ... my caprice, and\nfor its being guaranteed to me when necessary.  Suffering would be out of\nplace in vaudevilles, for instance; I know that.  In the “Palace of Crystal” it\nis unthinkable; suffering means doubt, negation, and what would be the\ngood of a “palace of crystal” if there could be any doubt about it?  And yet\nI think man will never renounce real suffering, that is, destruction and\nchaos.  Why, suffering is the sole origin of consciousness.  Though I did\nlay it down at the beginning that consciousness is the greatest misfortune\nfor man, yet I know man prizes it and would not give it up for any\nsatisfaction.  Consciousness, for instance, is infinitely superior to twice\ntwo makes four.  Once you have mathematical certainty there is nothing\nleft to do or to understand.  There will be nothing left but to bottle up your\nfive senses and plunge into contemplation.  While if you stick to\nconsciousness, even though the same result is attained, you can at least flog\nyourself at times, and that will, at any rate, liven you up.  Reactionary as it\nis, corporal punishment is better than nothing.",
        "\nYou believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyed—a palace at\nwhich one will not be able to put out one’s tongue or make a long nose on\nthe sly.  And perhaps that is just why I am afraid of this edifice, that it is\nof crystal and can never be destroyed and that one cannot put one’s tongue\nout at it even on the sly.",
        "You see, if it were not a palace, but a hen-house, I might creep into it\nto avoid getting wet, and yet I would not call the hen-house a palace out\nof gratitude to it for keeping me dry.  You laugh and say that in such\ncircumstances a hen-house is as good as a mansion.  Yes, I answer, if one\nhad to live simply to keep out of the rain.",
        "But what is to be done if I have taken it into my head that that is not the\nonly object in life, and that if one must live one had better live in a\nmansion?  That is my choice, my desire.  You will only eradicate it when\nyou have changed my preference.  Well, do change it, allure me with\nsomething else, give me another ideal.  But meanwhile I will not take a\nhen-house for a mansion.  The palace of crystal may be an idle dream, it\nmay be that it is inconsistent with the laws of nature and that I have\ninvented it only through my own stupidity, through the old-fashioned\nirrational habits of my generation.  But what does it matter to me that it is\ninconsistent?  That makes no difference since it exists in my desires, or\nrather exists as long as my desires exist.  Perhaps you are laughing again?\nLaugh away; I will put up with any mockery rather than pretend that I am\nsatisfied when I am hungry.  I know, anyway, that I will not be put off with\na compromise, with a recurring zero, simply because it is consistent with\nthe laws of nature and actually exists.  I will not accept as the crown of my\ndesires a block of buildings with tenements for the poor on a lease of a\nthousand years, and perhaps with a sign-board of a dentist hanging out. \nDestroy my desires, eradicate my ideals, show me something better, and I\nwill follow you.  You will say, perhaps, that it is not worth your trouble;\nbut in that case I can give you the same answer.  We are discussing things\nseriously; but if you won’t deign to give me your attention, I will drop\nyour acquaintance.  I can retreat into my underground hole.",
        "But while I am alive and have desires I would rather my hand were\nwithered off than bring one brick to such a building!  Don’t remind me\nthat I have just rejected the palace of crystal for the sole reason that one\ncannot put out one’s tongue at it.  I did not say because I am so fond of\nputting my tongue out.  Perhaps the thing I resented was, that of all your\nedifices there has not been one at which one could not put out one’s\ntongue.  On the contrary, I would let my tongue be cut off out of gratitude\nif things could be so arranged that I should lose all desire to put it out.  It\nis not my fault that things cannot be so arranged, and that one must be\nsatisfied with model flats.  Then why am I made with such desires?  Can I\nhave been constructed simply in order to come to the conclusion that all\nmy construction is a cheat?  Can this be my whole purpose?  I do not\nbelieve it.",
        "But do you know what: I am convinced that we underground folk\nought to be kept on a curb.  Though we may sit forty years underground\nwithout speaking, when we do come out into the light of day and break\nout we talk and talk and talk ....",

Though I have\nsaid that I envy the normal man to the last drop of my bile, yet I should\nnot care to be in his place such as he is now (though I shall not cease\nenvying him).  No, no; anyway the underground life is more advantageous.\nThere, at any rate, one can ...  Oh, but even now I am lying!

I swear to you,\ngentlemen, there is not one thing, not one word of what I have written that I\nreally believe.  That is, I believe it, perhaps, but at the same time I feel\nand suspect that I am lying like a cobbler.",
        "“Then why have you written all this?” you will say to me.  “I ought to\nput you underground for forty years without anything to do and then\ncome to you in your cellar, to find out what stage you have reached!  How\ncan a man be left with nothing to do for forty years?”",
        "“Isn’t that shameful, isn’t that humiliating?” you will say, perhaps,\nwagging your heads contemptuously.  “You thirst for life and try to settle\nthe problems of life by a logical tangle.  And how persistent, how insolent\nare your sallies, and at the same time what a scare you are in!  You talk\nnonsense and are pleased with it; you say impudent things and are in\ncontinual alarm and apologising for them.  You declare that you are\nafraid of nothing and at the same time try to ingratiate yourself in our\ngood opinion.  You declare that you are gnashing your teeth and at the\nsame time you try to be witty so as to amuse us.  You know that your\nwitticisms are not witty, but you are evidently well satisfied with their\nliterary value.  You may, perhaps, have really suffered, but you have no\nrespect for your own suffering.  You may have sincerity, but you have no\nmodesty; out of the pettiest vanity you expose your sincerity to publicity\nand ignominy.  You doubtlessly mean to say something, but hide your last\nword through fear, because you have not the resolution to utter it, and\nonly have a cowardly impudence.  You boast of consciousness, but you\nare not sure of your ground, for though your mind works, yet your heart is\ndarkened and corrupt, and you cannot have a full, genuine consciousness\nwithout a pure heart.  And how intrusive you are, how you insist and\ngrimace!  Lies, lies, lies!”",
        "Of course I have myself made up all the things you say.  That, too, is\nfrom underground.  I have been for forty years listening to you through a\ncrack under the floor.

Anyway, I am not strong-minded enough for that, and I\ndon’t see why I should be.  But you see a fancy has occurred to me and I\nwant to realise it at all costs.  Let me explain.",
        "Every man has reminiscences which he would not tell to everyone,\nbut only to his friends.  He has other matters in his mind which he would\nnot reveal even to his friends, but only to himself, and that in secret.  But\nthere are other things which a man is afraid to tell even to himself, and\nevery decent man has a number of such things stored away in his mind. \nThe more decent he is, the greater the number of such things in his\nmind.  Anyway, I have only lately determined to remember some of my\nearly adventures.  Till now I have always avoided them, even with a\ncertain uneasiness.  Now, when I am not only recalling them, but have\nactually decided to write an account of them, I want to try the experiment\nwhether one can, even with oneself, be perfectly open and not take\nfright at the whole truth.  I will observe, in parenthesis, that Heine says\nthat a true autobiography is almost an impossibility, and that man is\nbound to lie about himself.  He considers that Rousseau certainly told lies\nabout himself in his confessions, and even intentionally lied, out of\nvanity.  I am convinced that Heine is right; I quite understand how\nsometimes one may, out of sheer vanity, attribute regular crimes to\noneself, and indeed I can very well conceive that kind of vanity.  But\nHeine judged of people who made their confessions to the public.  I write\nonly for myself, and I wish to declare once and for all that if I write as\nthough I were addressing readers, that is simply because it is easier for me\nto write in that form.  It is a form, an empty form—I shall never have\nreaders.  I have made this plain already ...",
        "I don’t wish to be hampered by any restrictions in the compilation of\nmy notes.  I shall not attempt any system or method.  I will jot things down\nas I remember them.",
        "But here, perhaps, someone will catch at the word and ask me: if you\nreally don’t reckon on readers, why do you make such compacts with\nyourself—and on paper too—that is, that you won’t attempt any system\nor method, that you jot things down as you remember them, and so on,\nand so on?  Why are you explaining?  Why do you apologise?",
        "Well, there it is, I answer.",
        "There is a whole psychology in all this, though.  Perhaps it is simply\nthat I am a coward.  And perhaps that I purposely imagine an audience\nbefore me in order that I may be more dignified while I write.  There are\nperhaps thousands of reasons.  Again, what is my object precisely in\nwriting?  If it is not for the benefit of the public why should I not simply\nrecall these incidents in my own mind without putting them on paper?",
        "Quite so; but yet it  is more imposing on paper.  There is something\nmore impressive in it; I shall be better able to criticise myself and improve\nmy style.  Besides, I shall perhaps obtain actual relief from writing. \nToday, for instance, I am particularly oppressed by one memory of a\ndistant past.  It came back vividly to my mind a few days ago, and has\nremained haunting me like an annoying tune that one cannot get rid of. \nAnd yet I must get rid of it somehow.  I have hundreds of such reminiscences;\nbut at times some one stands out from the hundred and oppresses me.\nFor some reason I believe that if I write it down I should get rid of it.\nWhy not try?",
        "Besides, I am bored, and I never have anything to do.  Writing will be a\nsort of work.  They say work makes man kind-hearted and honest.  Well,\nhere is a chance for me, anyway.",

        "A Propos of the Wet Snow",
        "\nAT THAT TIME I was only twenty-four.  My life was even then gloomy, ill-\nregulated, and as solitary as that of a savage.  I made friends with no one\nand positively avoided talking, and buried myself more and more in my\nhole.  At work in the office I never looked at anyone, and was perfectly\nwell aware that my companions looked upon me, not only as a queer\nfellow, but even looked upon me—I always fancied this—with a sort of\nloathing.  I sometimes wondered why it was that nobody except me\nfancied that he was looked upon with aversion?  One of the clerks had a\nmost repulsive, pock-marked face, which looked positively villainous.  I\nbelieve I should not have dared to look at anyone with such an unsightly\ncountenance.  Another had such a very dirty old uniform that there was\nan unpleasant odour in his proximity.  Yet not one of these gentlemen\nshowed the slightest self-consciousness—either about their clothes or\ntheir countenance or their character in any way.  Neither of them ever\nimagined that they were looked at with repulsion; if they had imagined it\nthey would not have minded—so long as their superiors did not look at\nthem in that way.  It is clear to me now that, owing to my unbounded\nvanity and to the high standard I set for myself, I often looked at myself\nwith furious discontent, which verged on loathing, and so I inwardly\nattributed the same feeling to everyone.  I hated my face, for instance: I\nthought it disgusting, and even suspected that there was something base\nin my expression, and so every day when I turned up at the office I tried to\nbehave as independently as possible, and to assume a lofty expression, so\nthat I might not be suspected of being abject.  “My face may be ugly,” I\nthought, “but let it be lofty, expressive, and, above all, EXTREMELY\nintelligent.”  But I was positively and painfully certain that it was\nimpossible for my countenance ever to express those qualities.  And what was\nworst of all, I thought it actually stupid looking, and I would have been quite\nsatisfied if I could have looked intelligent.  In fact, I would even have put\nup with looking base if, at the same time, my face could have been\nthought strikingly intelligent.",
        "Of course, I hated my fellow clerks one and all, and I despised them all,\nyet at the same time I was, as it were, afraid of them.  In fact, it happened at\ntimes that I thought more highly of them than of myself.  It somehow\nhappened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising them and\nthinking them superior to myself.  A cultivated and decent man cannot be\nvain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and without\ndespising and almost hating himself at certain moments.  But whether I\ndespised them or thought them superior I dropped my eyes almost every\ntime I met anyone.  I even made experiments whether I could face so and\nso’s looking at me, and I was always the first to drop my eyes.  This worried\nme to distraction.  I had a sickly dread, too, of being ridiculous, and so had\na slavish passion for the conventional in everything external.  I loved to fall\ninto the common rut, and had a whole-hearted terror of any kind of\neccentricity in myself.  But how could I live up to it?  I was morbidly\nsensitive as a man of our age should be.  They were all stupid, and as like\none another as so many sheep.  Perhaps I was the only one in the office who\nfancied that I was a coward and a slave, and I fancied it just because I was\nmore highly developed.  But it was not only that I fancied it, it really was so. \nI was a coward and a slave.  I say this without the slightest embarrassment.\nEvery decent man of our age must be a coward and a slave.  That is his\nnormal condition.  Of that I am firmly persuaded.  He is made and constructed\nto that very end.  And not only at the present time owing to some\ncasual circumstances, but always, at all times, a decent man is bound to\nbe a coward and a slave.  It is the law of nature for all decent people all over\nthe earth.  If anyone of them happens to be valiant about something, he\nneed not be comforted nor carried away by that; he would show the white\nfeather just the same before something else.  That is how it invariably and\ninevitably ends.  Only donkeys and mules are valiant, and they only till\nthey are pushed up to the wall.  It is not worth while to pay attention to\nthem for they really are of no consequence.",
        "Another circumstance, too, worried me in those days: that there was no\none like me and I was unlike anyone else.  “I am alone and they are\nEVERYONE,” I thought—and pondered.",
        "From that it is evident that I was still a youngster.",
        "The very opposite sometimes happened.  It was loathsome sometimes\nto go to the office; things reached such a point that I often came home ill. \nBut all at once, A PROPOS of nothing, there would come a phase of\nscepticism and indifference (everything happened in phases to me), and I\nwould laugh myself at my intolerance and fastidiousness, I would reproach\nmyself with being ROMANTIC.  At one time I was unwilling to speak\nto anyone, while at other times I would not only talk, but go to the length\nof contemplating making friends with them.  All my fastidiousness would\nsuddenly, for no rhyme or reason, vanish.  Who knows, perhaps I never\nhad really had it, and it had simply been affected, and got out of books.  I\nhave not decided that question even now.  Once I quite made friends with\nthem, visited their homes, played preference, drank vodka, talked of\npromotions ....  But here let me make a digression.",
        "We Russians, speaking generally, have never had those foolish\ntranscendental “romantics\"—German, and still more French—on whom\nnothing produces any effect; if there were an earthquake, if all France\nperished at the barricades, they would still be the same, they would not\neven have the decency to affect a change, but would still go on singing\ntheir transcendental songs to the hour of their death, because they are\nfools.  We, in Russia, have no fools; that is well known.  That is what\ndistinguishes us from foreign lands.  Consequently these transcendental\nnatures are not found amongst us in their pure form.  The idea that they\nare is due to our “realistic” journalists and critics of that day, always on\nthe look out for Kostanzhoglos and Uncle Pyotr Ivanitchs and foolishly\naccepting them as our ideal; they have slandered our romantics, taking\nthem for the same transcendental sort as in Germany or France.  On the\ncontrary, the characteristics of our “romantics” are absolutely and directly\nopposed to the transcendental European type, and no European\nstandard can be applied to them.  (Allow me to make use of this word\n\"romantic\"—an old-fashioned and much respected word which has\ndone good service and is familiar to all.)  The characteristics of our\nromantic are to understand everything, TO SEE EVERYTHING AND TO SEE IT\nOFTEN INCOMPARABLY MORE CLEARLY THAN OUR MOST REALISTIC MINDS SEE IT; to\nrefuse to accept anyone or anything, but at the same time not to despise\nanything; to give way, to yield, from policy; never to lose sight of a useful\npractical object (such as rent-free quarters at the government expense,\npensions, decorations), to keep their eye on that object through all the\nenthusiasms and volumes of lyrical poems, and at the same time to preserve\n\"the sublime and the beautiful” inviolate within them to the hour of\ntheir death, and to preserve themselves also, incidentally, like some precious\njewel wrapped in cotton wool if only for the benefit of “the sublime\nand the beautiful.”  Our “romantic” is a man of great breadth and the\ngreatest rogue of all our rogues, I assure you ....  I can assure you from\nexperience, indeed.  Of course, that is, if he is intelligent.  But what am I\nsaying!  The romantic is always intelligent, and I only meant to observe\nthat although we have had foolish romantics they don’t count, and they\nwere only so because in the flower of their youth they degenerated into\nGermans, and to preserve their precious jewel more comfortably, settled\nsomewhere out there—by preference in Weimar or the Black Forest.",
        "I, for instance, genuinely despised my official work and did not openly\nabuse it simply because I was in it myself and got a salary for it.  Anyway,\ntake note, I did not openly abuse it.  Our romantic would rather go out of\nhis mind—a thing, however, which very rarely happens—than take to\nopen abuse, unless he had some other career in view; and he is never\nkicked out.  At most, they would take him to the lunatic asylum as “the\nKing of Spain” if he should go very mad.  But it is only the thin, fair people\nwho go out of their minds in Russia.  Innumerable “romantics” attain later\nin life to considerable rank in the service.  Their many-sidedness is\nremarkable!  And what a faculty they have for the most contradictory\nsensations!  I was comforted by this thought even in those days, and I am of\nthe same opinion now.  That is why there are so many “broad natures” among\nus who never lose their ideal even in the depths of degradation; and though\nthey never stir a finger for their ideal, though they are arrant thieves and\nknaves, yet they tearfully cherish their first ideal and are extraordinarily\nhonest at heart.  Yes, it is only among us that the most incorrigible rogue\ncan be absolutely and loftily honest at heart without in the least ceasing to\nbe a rogue.  I repeat, our romantics, frequently, become such accomplished\nrascals (I use the term “rascals” affectionately), suddenly display\nsuch a sense of reality and practical knowledge that their bewildered superiors\nand the public generally can only ejaculate in amazement.",
        "Their many-sidedness is really amazing, and goodness knows what it\nmay develop into later on, and what the future has in store for us.  It is not\na poor material!  I do not say this from any foolish or boastful patriotism. \nBut I feel sure that you are again imagining that I am joking.  Or perhaps\nit’s just the contrary and you are convinced that I really think so.  Anyway,\ngentlemen, I shall welcome both views as an honour and a special favour. \nAnd do forgive my digression.",
        "I did not, of course, maintain friendly relations with my comrades and\nsoon was at loggerheads with them, and in my youth and inexperience I\neven gave up bowing to them, as though I had cut off all relations.  That,\nhowever, only happened to me once.  As a rule, I was always alone.",
        "In the first place I spent most of my time at home, reading.  I tried to\nstifle all that was continually seething within me by means of external\nimpressions.  And the only external means I had was reading.  Reading, of\ncourse, was a great help—exciting me, giving me pleasure and pain.  But\nat times it bored me fearfully.  One longed for movement in spite of\neverything, and I plunged all at once into dark, underground, loathsome\nvice of the pettiest kind.  My wretched passions were acute, smarting,\nfrom my continual, sickly irritability I had hysterical impulses, with\ntears and convulsions.  I had no resource except reading, that is, there was\nnothing in my surroundings which I could respect and which attracted\nme. I was overwhelmed with depression, too; I had an hysterical craving\nfor incongruity and for contrast, and so I took to vice.  I have not said all\nthis to justify myself ....  But, no!  I am lying.  I did want to justify\nmyself.  I make that little observation for my own benefit, gentlemen.  I don’t\nwant to lie.  I vowed to myself I would not.",
        "And so, furtively, timidly, in solitude, at night, I indulged in filthy\nvice, with a feeling of shame which never deserted me, even at the most\nloathsome moments, and which at such moments nearly made me curse. \nAlready even then I had my underground world in my soul.  I was\nfearfully afraid of being seen, of being met, of being recognised.  I visited\nvarious obscure haunts.",
        "One night as I was passing a tavern I saw through a lighted window\nsome gentlemen fighting with billiard cues, and saw one of them thrown\nout of the window.  At other times I should have felt very much disgusted,\nbut I was in such a mood at the time, that I actually envied the gentleman\nthrown out of the window—and I envied him so much that I even went\ninto the tavern and into the billiard-room.  “Perhaps,” I thought, “I’ll\nhave a fight, too, and they’ll throw me out of the window.”",
        "I was not drunk—but what is one to do—depression will drive a man\nto such a pitch of hysteria?  But nothing happened.  It seemed that I was\nnot even equal to being thrown out of the window and I went away\nwithout having my fight.",
        "An officer put me in my place from the first moment.",
        "I was standing by the billiard-table and in my ignorance blocking up\nthe way, and he wanted to pass; he took me by the shoulders and without a\nword—without a warning or explanation—moved me from where I was\nstanding to another spot and passed by as though he had not noticed me.  I\ncould have forgiven blows, but I could not forgive his having moved me\nwithout noticing me.",
        "Devil knows what I would have given for a real regular quarrel—a\nmore decent, a more LITERARY one, so to speak.  I had been treated like a\nfly.  This officer was over six foot, while I was a spindly little fellow.  But\nthe quarrel was in my hands.  I had only to protest and I certainly would\nhave been thrown out of the window.  But I changed my mind and\npreferred to beat a resentful retreat.",
        "I went out of the tavern straight home, confused and troubled, and the\nnext night I went out again with the same lewd intentions, still more\nfurtively, abjectly and miserably than before, as it were, with tears in my\neyes—but still I did go out again.  Don’t imagine, though, it was coward-\nice made me slink away from the officer; I never have been a coward at\nheart, though I have always been a coward in action.  Don’t be in a hurry\nto laugh—I assure you I can explain it all.",
        "Oh, if only that officer had been one of the sort who would consent to\nfight a duel!  But no, he was one of those gentlemen (alas, long extinct!)\nwho preferred fighting with cues or, like Gogol’s Lieutenant Pirogov,\nappealing to the police.  They did not fight duels and would have thought\na duel with a civilian like me an utterly unseemly procedure in any\ncase—and they looked upon the duel altogether as something impossible,\nsomething free-thinking and French.  But they were quite ready to\nbully, especially when they were over six foot.",
        "I did not slink away through cowardice, but through an unbounded\nvanity.  I was afraid not of his six foot, not of getting a sound thrashing and\nbeing thrown out of the window; I should have had physical courage\nenough, I assure you; but I had not the moral courage.  What I was afraid of\nwas that everyone present, from the insolent marker down to the lowest\nlittle stinking, pimply clerk in a greasy collar, would jeer at me and fail to\nunderstand when I began to protest and to address them in literary language.\nFor of the point of honour—not of honour, but of the point of\nhonour (POINT D’HONNEUR)—one cannot speak among us except in literary\nlanguage.  You can’t allude to the “point of honour” in ordinary language. \nI was fully convinced (the sense of reality, in spite of all my romanticism!)\nthat they would all simply split their sides with laughter, and that the\nofficer would not simply beat me, that is, without insulting me, but would\ncertainly prod me in the back with his knee, kick me round the billiard-\ntable, and only then perhaps have pity and drop me out of the window.",
        "Of course, this trivial incident could not with me end in that.  I often\nmet that officer afterwards in the street and noticed him very carefully.  I\nam not quite sure whether he recognised me, I imagine not; I judge from\ncertain signs.  But I—I stared at him with spite and hatred and so it went\non ... for several years!  My resentment grew even deeper with years.  At\nfirst I began making stealthy inquiries about this officer.  It was difficult\nfor me to do so, for I knew no one.  But one day I heard someone shout his\nsurname in the street as I was following him at a distance, as though I\nwere tied to him—and so I learnt his surname.  Another time I followed\nhim to his flat, and for ten kopecks learned from the porter where he\nlived, on which storey, whether he lived alone or with others, and so\non—in fact, everything one could learn from a porter.  One morning,\nthough I had never tried my hand with the pen, it suddenly occurred to\nme to write a satire on this officer in the form of a novel which would unmask\nhis villainy.  I wrote the novel with relish.  I did unmask his villainy,\nI even exaggerated it; at first I so altered his surname that it could easily be\nrecognised, but on second thoughts I changed it, and sent the story to the\nOTETCHESTVENNIYA ZAPISKI.  But at that time such attacks were not the\nfashion and my story was not printed.  That was a great vexation to me.",
        "Sometimes I was positively choked with resentment.  At last I determined\nto challenge my enemy to a duel.  I composed a splendid, charming\nletter to him, imploring him to apologise to me, and hinting rather\nplainly at a duel in case of refusal.  The letter was so composed that if the\nofficer had had the least understanding of the sublime and the beautiful\nhe would certainly have flung himself on my neck and have offered me\nhis friendship.  And how fine that would have been!  How we should have\ngot on together!  “He could have shielded me with his higher rank, while I\ncould have improved his mind with my culture, and, well ... my ideas,\nand all sorts of things might have happened.”  Only fancy, this was two\nyears after his insult to me, and my challenge would have been a\nridiculous anachronism, in spite of all the ingenuity of my letter in\ndisguising and explaining away the anachronism.  But, thank God (to this\nday I thank the Almighty with tears in my eyes) I did not send the letter to\nhim.  Cold shivers run down my back when I think of what might have\nhappened if I had sent it.",
        "And all at once I revenged myself in the simplest way, by a stroke of\ngenius!  A brilliant thought suddenly dawned upon me.  Sometimes on\nholidays I used to stroll along the sunny side of the Nevsky about four\no’clock in the afternoon.  Though it was hardly a stroll so much as a series of\ninnumerable miseries, humiliations and resentments; but no doubt that\nwas just what I wanted.  I used to wriggle along in a most unseemly fashion,\nlike an eel, continually moving aside to make way for generals, for officers\nof the guards and the hussars, or for ladies.  At such minutes there used to be\na convulsive twinge at my heart, and I used to feel hot all down my back at\nthe mere thought of the wretchedness of my attire, of the wretchedness and\nabjectness of my little scurrying figure.  This was a regular martyrdom, a\ncontinual, intolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an\nincessant and direct sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this\nworld, a nasty, disgusting fly—more intelligent, more highly developed,\nmore refined in feeling than any of them, of course—but a fly that was\ncontinually making way for everyone, insulted and injured by everyone. \nWhy I inflicted this torture upon myself, why I went to the Nevsky, I don’t\nknow.  I felt simply drawn there at every possible opportunity.",
        "Already then I began to experience a rush of the enjoyment of which I\nspoke in the first chapter.  After my affair with the officer I felt even more\ndrawn there than before: it was on the Nevsky that I met him most frequently,\nthere I could admire him.  He, too, went there chiefly on holidays,\nHe, too, turned out of his path for generals and persons of high rank, and\nhe too, wriggled between them like an eel; but people, like me, or even\nbetter dressed than me, he simply walked over; he made straight for them\nas though there was nothing but empty space before him, and never, under\nany circumstances, turned aside.  I gloated over my resentment watching\nhim and ... always resentfully made way for him.  It exasperated me that\neven in the street I could not be on an even footing with him.",
        "“Why must you invariably be the first to move aside?” I kept asking\nmyself in hysterical rage, waking up sometimes at three o’clock in the\nmorning.  “Why is it you and not he?  There’s no regulation about it;\nthere’s no written law.  Let the making way be equal as it usually is when\nrefined people meet; he moves half-way and you move half-way; you pass\nwith mutual respect.”",
        "But that never happened, and I always moved aside, while he did not\neven notice my making way for him.  And lo and behold a bright idea\ndawned upon me!  “What,” I thought, “if I meet him and don’t move on\none side?  What if I don’t move aside on purpose, even if I knock up\nagainst him?  How would that be?” This audacious idea took such a hold\non me that it gave me no peace.  I was dreaming of it continually, horribly,\nand I purposely went more frequently to the Nevsky in order to picture\nmore vividly how I should do it when I did do it.  I was delighted.  This\nintention seemed to me more and more practical and possible.",
        "“Of course I shall not really push him,” I thought, already more good-\nnatured in my joy.  “I will simply not turn aside, will run up against him,\nnot very violently, but just shouldering each other—just as much as\ndecency permits.  I will push against him just as much as he pushes\nagainst me.”  At last I made up my mind completely.  But my preparations\ntook a great deal of time.  To begin with, when I carried out my plan I\nshould need to be looking rather more decent, and so I had to think of my\nget-up.  “In case of emergency, if, for instance, there were any sort of\npublic scandal (and the public there is of the most RECHERCHE: the Countess\nwalks there; Prince D. walks there; all the literary world is there), I must\nbe well dressed; that inspires respect and of itself puts us on an equal\nfooting in the eyes of the society.”",
        "With this object I asked for some of my salary in advance, and bought at\nTchurkin’s a pair of black gloves and a decent hat.  Black gloves seemed to\nme both more dignified and BON TON than the lemon-coloured ones which\nI had contemplated at first.  “The colour is too gaudy, it looks as though one\nwere trying to be conspicuous,” and I did not take the lemon-coloured\nones.  I had got ready long beforehand a good shirt, with white bone studs;\nmy overcoat was the only thing that held me back.  The coat in itself was a\nvery good one, it kept me warm; but it was wadded and it had a raccoon\ncollar which was the height of vulgarity.  I had to change the collar at any\nsacrifice, and to have a beaver one like an officer’s.  For this purpose I\nbegan visiting the Gostiny Dvor and after several attempts I pitched upon a\npiece of cheap German beaver.  Though these German beavers soon grow\nshabby and look wretched, yet at first they look exceedingly well, and I\nonly needed it for the occasion.  I asked the price; even so, it was too\nexpensive.  After thinking it over thoroughly I decided to sell my raccoon\ncollar.  The rest of the money—a considerable sum for me, I decided to\nborrow from Anton Antonitch Syetotchkin, my immediate superior, an\nunassuming person, though grave and judicious.  He never lent money to\nanyone, but I had, on entering the service, been specially recommended\nto him by an important personage who had got me my berth.  I was\nhorribly worried.  To borrow from Anton Antonitch seemed to me monstrous\nand shameful.  I did not sleep for two or three nights.  Indeed, I did\nnot sleep well at that time, I was in a fever; I had a vague sinking at my heart\nor else a sudden throbbing, throbbing, throbbing!  Anton Antonitch was\nsurprised at first, then he frowned, then he reflected, and did after all lend\nme the money, receiving from me a written authorisation to take from my\nsalary a fortnight later the sum that he had lent me.",
        "In this way everything was at last ready.  The handsome beaver replaced\nthe mean-looking raccoon, and I began by degrees to get to work.  It\nwould never have done to act offhand, at random; the plan had to be\ncarried out skilfully, by degrees.  But I must confess that after many efforts\nI began to despair: we simply could not run into each other.  I made every\npreparation, I was quite determined—it seemed as though we should run\ninto one another directly—and before I knew what I was doing I had\nstepped aside for him again and he had passed without noticing me.  I\neven prayed as I approached him that God would grant me determination.\nOne time I had made up my mind thoroughly, but it ended in my\nstumbling and falling at his feet because at the very last instant when I\nwas six inches from him my courage failed me.  He very calmly stepped\nover me, while I flew on one side like a ball.  That night I was ill again,\nfeverish and delirious.",
        "And suddenly it ended most happily.  The night before I had made up\nmy mind not to carry out my fatal plan and to abandon it all, and with\nthat object I went to the Nevsky for the last time, just to see how I would\nabandon it all.  Suddenly, three paces from my enemy, I unexpectedly\nmade up my mind—I closed my eyes, and we ran full tilt, shoulder to\nshoulder, against one another!  I did not budge an inch and passed him on\na perfectly equal footing!  He did not even look round and pretended not\nto notice it; but he was only pretending, I am convinced of that.  I am\nconvinced of that to this day!  Of course, I got the worst of it—he was\nstronger, but that was not the point.  The point was that I had attained my\nobject, I had kept up my dignity, I had not yielded a step, and had put\nmyself publicly on an equal social footing with him.  I returned home\nfeeling that I was fully avenged for everything.  I was delighted.  I was\ntriumphant and sang Italian arias.  Of course, I will not describe to you\nwhat happened to me three days later; if you have read my first chapter\nyou can guess for yourself.  The officer was afterwards transferred; I have\nnot seen him now for fourteen years.  What is the dear fellow doing now?\nWhom is he walking over?",
        "\nBut the period of my dissipation would end and I always felt very sick\nafterwards.  It was followed by remorse—I tried to drive it away; I felt too\nsick.  By degrees, however, I grew used to that too.  I grew used to\neverything, or rather I voluntarily resigned myself to enduring it.  But I\nhad a means of escape that reconciled everything—that was to find\nrefuge in “the sublime and the beautiful,” in dreams, of course.  I was a\nterrible dreamer, I would dream for three months on end, tucked away in\nmy corner, and you may believe me that at those moments I had no\nresemblance to the gentleman who, in the perturbation of his chicken\nheart, put a collar of German beaver on his great-coat.  I suddenly\nbecame a hero.  I would not have admitted my six-foot lieutenant even if\nhe had called on me.  I could not even picture him before me then.  What\nwere my dreams and how I could satisfy myself with them—it is hard to\nsay now, but at the time I was satisfied with them.  Though, indeed, even\nnow, I am to some extent satisfied with them.  Dreams were particularly\nsweet and vivid after a spell of dissipation; they came with remorse and\nwith tears, with curses and transports.  There were moments of such\npositive intoxication, of such happiness, that there was not the faintest\ntrace of irony within me, on my honour.  I had faith, hope, love.  I\nbelieved blindly at such times that by some miracle, by some external\ncircumstance, all this would suddenly open out, expand; that suddenly a\nvista of suitable activity—beneficent, good, and, above all, READY MADE\n(what sort of activity I had no idea, but the great thing was that it should\nbe all ready for me)—would rise up before me—and I should come out\ninto the light of day, almost riding a white horse and crowned with laurel. \nAnything but the foremost place I could not conceive for myself, and for\nthat very reason I quite contentedly occupied the lowest in reality.  Either\nto be a hero or to grovel in the mud—there was nothing between.  That\nwas my ruin, for when I was in the mud I comforted myself with the\nthought that at other times I was a hero, and the hero was a cloak for the\nmud: for an ordinary man it was shameful to defile himself, but a hero\nwas too lofty to be utterly defiled, and so he might defile himself.  It is\nworth noting that these attacks of the “sublime and the beautiful” visited\nme even during the period of dissipation and just at the times when I was\ntouching the bottom.  They came in separate spurts, as though reminding\nme of themselves, but did not banish the dissipation by their appearance. \nOn the contrary, they seemed to add a zest to it by contrast, and were only\nsufficiently present to serve as an appetising sauce.  That sauce was made\nup of contradictions and sufferings, of agonising inward analysis, and all\nthese pangs and pin-pricks gave a certain piquancy, even a significance to\nmy dissipation—in fact, completely answered the purpose of an appetising\nsauce.  There was a certain depth of meaning in it.  And I could hardly\nhave resigned myself to the simple, vulgar, direct debauchery of a clerk\nand have endured all the filthiness of it.  What could have allured me\nabout it then and have drawn me at night into the street?  No, I had a lofty\nway of getting out of it all.",
        "And what loving-kindness, oh Lord, what loving-kindness I felt at\ntimes in those dreams of mine!  in those “flights into the sublime and the\nbeautiful\"; though it was fantastic love, though it was never applied to\nanything human in reality, yet there was so much of this love that one did\nnot feel afterwards even the impulse to apply it in reality; that would have\nbeen superfluous.  Everything, however, passed satisfactorily by a lazy\nand fascinating transition into the sphere of art, that is, into the beautiful\nforms of life, lying ready, largely stolen from the poets and novelists and\nadapted to all sorts of needs and uses.  I, for instance, was triumphant over\neveryone; everyone, of course, was in dust and ashes, and was forced\nspontaneously to recognise my superiority, and I forgave them all.  I was a\npoet and a grand gentleman, I fell in love; I came in for countless\nmillions and immediately devoted them to humanity, and at the same\ntime I confessed before all the people my shameful deeds, which, of\ncourse, were not merely shameful, but had in them much that was\n\"sublime and beautiful” something in the Manfred style.  Everyone\nwould kiss me and weep (what idiots they would be if they did not), while\nI should go barefoot and hungry preaching new ideas and fighting a\nvictorious Austerlitz against the obscurantists.  Then the band would play\na march, an amnesty would be declared, the Pope would agree to retire\nfrom Rome to Brazil; then there would be a ball for the whole of Italy at\nthe Villa Borghese on the shores of Lake Como, Lake Como being for\nthat purpose transferred to the neighbourhood of Rome; then would\ncome a scene in the bushes, and so on, and so on—as though you did not\nknow all about it?  You will say that it is vulgar and contemptible to drag\nall this into public after all the tears and transports which I have myself\nconfessed.  But why is it contemptible?  Can you imagine that I am\nashamed of it all, and that it was stupider than anything in your life,\ngentlemen?  And I can assure you that some of these fancies were by no\nmeans badly composed ....  It did not all happen on the shores of Lake\nComo.  And yet you are right—it really is vulgar and contemptible.  And\nmost contemptible of all it is that now I am attempting to justify myself to\nyou.  And even more contemptible than that is my making this remark\nnow.  But that’s enough, or there will be no end to it; each step will be\nmore contemptible than the last ....",
        "I could never stand more than three months of dreaming at a time\nwithout feeling an irresistible desire to plunge into society.  To plunge\ninto society meant to visit my superior at the office, Anton Antonitch\nSyetotchkin.  He was the only permanent acquaintance I have had in my\nlife, and I wonder at the fact myself now.  But I only went to see him when\nthat phase came over me, and when my dreams had reached such a point\nof bliss that it became essential at once to embrace my fellows and all\nmankind; and for that purpose I needed, at least, one human being,\nactually existing.  I had to call on Anton Antonitch, however, on\nTuesday—his at-home day; so I had always to time my passionate desire\nto embrace humanity so that it might fall on a Tuesday.",
        "This Anton Antonitch lived on the fourth storey in a house in Five\nCorners, in four low-pitched rooms, one smaller than the other, of a\nparticularly frugal and sallow appearance.  He had two daughters and\ntheir aunt, who used to pour out the tea.  Of the daughters one was\nthirteen and another fourteen, they both had snub noses, and I was\nawfully shy of them because they were always whispering and giggling\ntogether.  The master of the house usually sat in his study on a leather\ncouch in front of the table with some grey-headed gentleman, usually a\ncolleague from our office or some other department.  I never saw more\nthan two or three visitors there, always the same.  They talked about the\nexcise duty; about business in the senate, about salaries, about promotions,\nabout His Excellency, and the best means of pleasing him, and so\non. I had the patience to sit like a fool beside these people for four hours at\na stretch, listening to them without knowing what to say to them or\nventuring to say a word.  I became stupefied, several times I felt myself\nperspiring, I was overcome by a sort of paralysis; but this was pleasant and\ngood for me.  On returning home I deferred for a time my desire to\nembrace all mankind.",
        "I had however one other acquaintance of a sort, Simonov, who was an\nold schoolfellow.  I had a number of schoolfellows, indeed, in Petersburg,\nbut I did not associate with them and had even given up nodding to them\nin the street.  I believe I had transferred into the department I was in\nsimply to avoid their company and to cut off all connection with my\nhateful childhood.  Curses on that school and all those terrible years of\npenal servitude!  In short, I parted from my schoolfellows as soon as I got\nout into the world.  There were two or three left to whom I nodded in the\nstreet.  One of them was Simonov, who had in no way been distinguished\nat school, was of a quiet and equable disposition; but I discovered in him\na certain independence of character and even honesty I don’t even\nsuppose that he was particularly stupid.  I had at one time spent some\nrather soulful moments with him, but these had not lasted long and had\nsomehow been suddenly clouded over.  He was evidently uncomfortable\nat these reminiscences, and was, I fancy, always afraid that I might take\nup the same tone again.  I suspected that he had an aversion for me, but\nstill I went on going to see him, not being quite certain of it.",
        "And so on one occasion, unable to endure my solitude and knowing\nthat as it was Thursday Anton Antonitch’s door would be closed, I\nthought of Simonov.  Climbing up to his fourth storey I was thinking that\nthe man disliked me and that it was a mistake to go and see him.  But as it\nalways happened that such reflections impelled me, as though purposely,\nto put myself into a false position, I went in.  It was almost a year since I\nhad last seen Simonov.",
        "\nI found two of my old schoolfellows with him.  They seemed to be\ndiscussing an important matter.  All of them took scarcely any notice of\nmy entrance, which was strange, for I had not met them for years. \nEvidently they looked upon me as something on the level of a common\nfly.  I had not been treated like that even at school, though they all hated\nme. I knew, of course, that they must despise me now for my lack of\nsuccess in the service, and for my having let myself sink so low, going\nabout badly dressed and so on—which seemed to them a sign of my\nincapacity and insignificance.  But I had not expected such contempt. \nSimonov was positively surprised at my turning up.  Even in old days he\nhad always seemed surprised at my coming.  All this disconcerted me: I\nsat down, feeling rather miserable, and began listening to what they were\nsaying.",
        "They were engaged in warm and earnest conversation about a farewell\ndinner which they wanted to arrange for the next day to a comrade of\ntheirs called Zverkov, an officer in the army, who was going away to a\ndistant province.  This Zverkov had been all the time at school with me\ntoo.  I had begun to hate him particularly in the upper forms.  In the lower\nforms he had simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody liked.  I\nhad hated him, however, even in the lower forms, just because he was a\npretty and playful boy.  He was always bad at his lessons and got worse and\nworse as he went on; however, he left with a good certificate, as he had\npowerful interests.  During his last year at school he came in for an estate\nof two hundred serfs, and as almost all of us were poor he took up a\nswaggering tone among us.  He was vulgar in the extreme, but at the same\ntime he was a good-natured fellow, even in his swaggering.  In spite of\nsuperficial, fantastic and sham notions of honour and dignity, all but very\nfew of us positively grovelled before Zverkov, and the more so the more he\nswaggered.  And it was not from any interested motive that they grovelled,\nbut simply because he had been favoured by the gifts of nature.  Moreover,\nit was, as it were, an accepted idea among us that Zverkov was a\nspecialist in regard to tact and the social graces.  This last fact particularly\ninfuriated me.  I hated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his\nadmiration of his own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid,\nthough he was bold in his language; I hated his handsome, but stupid\nface (for which I would, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent\none), and the free-and-easy military manners in fashion in the “’forties.\"\nI hated the way in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women\n(he did not venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the\nepaulettes of an officer, and was looking forward to them with impatience),\nand boasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting.  I remember\nhow I, invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened upon Zverkov,\nwhen one day talking at a leisure moment with his schoolfellows of his\nfuture relations with the fair sex, and growing as sportive as a puppy in\nthe sun, he all at once declared that he would not leave a single village\ngirl on his estate unnoticed, that that was his DROIT DE SEIGNEUR, and that if\nthe peasants dared to protest he would have them all flogged and double\nthe tax on them, the bearded rascals.  Our servile rabble applauded, but I\nattacked him, not from compassion for the girls and their fathers, but\nsimply because they were applauding such an insect.  I got the better of\nhim on that occasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he was lively and\nimpudent, and so laughed it off, and in such a way that my victory was\nnot really complete; the laugh was on his side.  He got the better of me on\nseveral occasions afterwards, but without malice, jestingly, casually.  I\nremained angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him. \nWhen we left school he made advances to me; I did not rebuff them, for I\nwas flattered, but we soon parted and quite naturally.  Afterwards I heard\nof his barrack-room success as a lieutenant, and of the fast life he was\nleading.  Then there came other rumours—of his successes in the service.\nBy then he had taken to cutting me in the street, and I suspected\nthat he was afraid of compromising himself by greeting a personage as\ninsignificant as me.  I saw him once in the theatre, in the third tier of\nboxes.  By then he was wearing shoulder-straps.  He was twisting and\ntwirling about, ingratiating himself with the daughters of an ancient\nGeneral.  In three years he had gone off considerably, though he was still\nrather handsome and adroit.  One could see that by the time he was thirty\nhe would be corpulent.  So it was to this Zverkov that my schoolfellows\nwere going to give a dinner on his departure.  They had kept up with him\nfor those three years, though privately they did not consider themselves\non an equal footing with him, I am convinced of that.",
        "Of Simonov’s two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianised German\n—a little fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always\nderiding everyone, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the lower\nforms—a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most sensitive\nfeeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a wretched\nlittle coward at heart.  He was one of those worshippers of Zverkov who\nmade up to the latter from interested motives, and often borrowed money\nfrom him.  Simonov’s other visitor, Trudolyubov, was a person in no way\nremarkable—a tall young fellow, in the army, with a cold face, fairly\nhonest, though he worshipped success of every sort, and was only capable\nof thinking of promotion.  He was some sort of distant relation of\nZverkov’s, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him a certain importance\namong us.  He always thought me of no consequence whatever; his\nbehaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was tolerable.",
        "“Well, with seven roubles each,” said Trudolyubov, “twenty-one\nroubles between the three of us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner. \nZverkov, of course, won’t pay.”",
        "“Of course not, since we are inviting him,” Simonov decided.",
        "“Can you imagine,” Ferfitchkin interrupted hotly and conceitedly, like\nsome insolent flunkey boasting of his master the General’s decorations,\n\"can you imagine that Zverkov will let us pay alone?  He will accept from\ndelicacy, but he will order half a dozen bottles of champagne.”",
        "“Do we want half a dozen for the four of us?” observed Trudolyubov,\ntaking notice only of the half dozen.",
        "“So the three of us, with Zverkov for the fourth, twenty-one roubles, at\nthe Hotel de Paris at five o’clock tomorrow,” Simonov, who had been\nasked to make the arrangements, concluded finally.",
        "“How twenty-one roubles?” I asked in some agitation, with a show of\nbeing offended; “if you count me it will not be twenty-one, but\ntwenty-eight roubles.”",
        "It seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly\nwould be positively graceful, and that they would all be conquered at\nonce and would look at me with respect.",
        "“Do you want to join, too?” Simonov observed, with no appearance of\npleasure, seeming to avoid looking at me.  He knew me through and through.",
        "It infuriated me that he knew me so thoroughly.",
        "“Why not?  I am an old schoolfellow of his, too, I believe, and I\nmust own I feel hurt that you have left me out,” I said, boiling over again.",
        "“And where were we to find you?” Ferfitchkin put in roughly.",
        "“You never were on good terms with Zverkov,” Trudolyubov added, frowning.",
        "But I had already clutched at the idea and would not give it up.",
        "“It seems to me that no one has a right to form an opinion upon that,” I\nretorted in a shaking voice, as though something tremendous had happened.\n\"Perhaps that is just my reason for wishing it now, that I have not\nalways been on good terms with him.”",
        "“Oh, there’s no making you out ... with these refinements,\"\nTrudolyubov jeered.",
        "“We’ll put your name down,” Simonov decided, addressing me.\n\"Tomorrow at five-o’clock at the Hotel de Paris.”",
        "“What about the money?” Ferfitchkin began in an undertone, indicating\nme to Simonov, but he broke off, for even Simonov was embarrassed.",
        "“That will do,” said Trudolyubov, getting up.  “If he wants to come so\nmuch, let him.”",
        "“But it’s a private thing, between us friends,” Ferfitchkin said crossly,\nas he, too, picked up his hat.  “It’s not an official gathering.”",
        "“We do not want at all, perhaps ...”",
        "They went away.  Ferfitchkin did not greet me in any way as he went\nout, Trudolyubov barely nodded.  Simonov, with whom I was left TETE-A-TETE,\nwas in a state of vexation and perplexity, and looked at me queerly.\nHe did not sit down and did not ask me to.",
        "“H’m ... yes ... tomorrow, then.  Will you pay your subscription\nnow?  I just ask so as to know,” he muttered in embarrassment.",
        "I flushed crimson, as I did so I remembered that I had owed Simonov\nfifteen roubles for ages—which I had, indeed, never forgotten, though I\nhad not paid it.",
        "“You will understand, Simonov, that I could have no idea when I came\nhere ....  I am very much vexed that I have forgotten ....”",
        "“All right, all right, that doesn’t matter.  You can pay tomorrow after the\ndinner.  I simply wanted to know ....  Please don’t ...”",
        "He broke off and began pacing the room still more vexed.  As he walked\nhe began to stamp with his heels.",
        "“Am I keeping you?” I asked, after two minutes of silence.",
        "“Oh!” he said, starting, “that is—to be truthful—yes.  I have to go and\nsee someone ... not far from here,” he added in an apologetic voice,\nsomewhat abashed.",
        "“My goodness, why didn’t you say so?” I cried, seizing my cap, with an\nastonishingly free-and-easy air, which was the last thing I should have\nexpected of myself.",
        "“It’s close by ... not two paces away,” Simonov repeated, accompanying\nme to the front door with a fussy air which did not suit him at all.  “So\nfive o’clock, punctually, tomorrow,” he called down the stairs after me. \nHe was very glad to get rid of me.  I was in a fury.",
        "“What possessed me, what possessed me to force myself upon them?” I\nwondered, grinding my teeth as I strode along the street, “for a scoundrel,\na pig like that Zverkov!  Of course I had better not go; of course, I must\njust snap my fingers at them.  I am not bound in any way.  I’ll send\nSimonov a note by tomorrow’s post ....”",
        "But what made me furious was that I knew for certain that I should go,\nthat I should make a point of going; and the more tactless, the more\nunseemly my going would be, the more certainly I would go.",
        "And there was a positive obstacle to my going: I had no money.  All I\nhad was nine roubles, I had to give seven of that to my servant, Apollon,\nfor his monthly wages.  That was all I paid him—he had to keep himself.",
        "Not to pay him was impossible, considering his character.  But I will\ntalk about that fellow, about that plague of mine, another time.",
        "However, I knew I should go and should not pay him his wages.",
        "That night I had the most hideous dreams.  No wonder; all the evening\nI had been oppressed by memories of my miserable days at school, and I\ncould not shake them off.  I was sent to the school by distant relations,\nupon whom I was dependent and of whom I have heard nothing since—\nthey sent me there a forlorn, silent boy, already crushed by their reproaches,\nalready troubled by doubt, and looking with savage distrust at\neveryone.  My schoolfellows met me with spiteful and merciless jibes\nbecause I was not like any of them.  But I could not endure their taunts; I\ncould not give in to them with the ignoble readiness with which they gave\nin to one another.  I hated them from the first, and shut myself away from\neveryone in timid, wounded and disproportionate pride.  Their coarseness\nrevolted me.  They laughed cynically at my face, at my clumsy\nfigure; and yet what stupid faces they had themselves.  In our school the\nboys’ faces seemed in a special way to degenerate and grow stupider.  How\nmany fine-looking boys came to us!  In a few years they became repulsive. \nEven at sixteen I wondered at them morosely; even then I was struck by\nthe pettiness of their thoughts, the stupidity of their pursuits, their games,\ntheir conversations.  They had no understanding of such essential things,\nthey took no interest in such striking, impressive subjects, that I could\nnot help considering them inferior to myself.  It was not wounded vanity\nthat drove me to it, and for God’s sake do not thrust upon me your\nhackneyed remarks, repeated to nausea, that “I was only a dreamer,\"\nwhile they even then had an understanding of life.  They understood\nnothing, they had no idea of real life, and I swear that that was what\nmade me most indignant with them.  On the contrary, the most obvious,\nstriking reality they accepted with fantastic stupidity and even at that time\nwere accustomed to respect success.  Everything that was just, but oppressed\nand looked down upon, they laughed at heartlessly and shamefully.\nThey took rank for intelligence; even at sixteen they were already\ntalking about a snug berth.  Of course, a great deal of it was due to their\nstupidity, to the bad examples with which they had always been surrounded\nin their childhood and boyhood.  They were monstrously depraved.\nOf course a great deal of that, too, was superficial and an\nassumption of cynicism; of course there were glimpses of youth and\nfreshness even in their depravity; but even that freshness was not attractive,\nand showed itself in a certain rakishness.  I hated them horribly,\nthough perhaps I was worse than any of them.  They repaid me in the\nsame way, and did not conceal their aversion for me.  But by then I did not\ndesire their affection: on the contrary, I continually longed for their\nhumiliation.  To escape from their derision I purposely began to make all\nthe progress I could with my studies and forced my way to the very top. \nThis impressed them.  Moreover, they all began by degrees to grasp that I\nhad already read books none of them could read, and understood things\n(not forming part of our school curriculum) of which they had not even\nheard.  They took a savage and sarcastic view of it, but were morally\nimpressed, especially as the teachers began to notice me on those\ngrounds.  The mockery ceased, but the hostility remained, and cold and\nstrained relations became permanent between us.  In the end I could not\nput up with it: with years a craving for society, for friends, developed in\nme. I attempted to get on friendly terms with some of my schoolfellows;\nbut somehow or other my intimacy with them was always strained and\nsoon ended of itself.  Once, indeed, I did have a friend.  But I was already\na tyrant at heart; I wanted to exercise unbounded sway over him; I tried to\ninstil into him a contempt for his surroundings; I required of him a\ndisdainful and complete break with those surroundings.  I frightened him\nwith my passionate affection; I reduced him to tears, to hysterics.  He was\na simple and devoted soul; but when he devoted himself to me entirely I\nbegan to hate him immediately and repulsed him—as though all I\nneeded him for was to win a victory over him, to subjugate him and\nnothing else.  But I could not subjugate all of them; my friend was not at\nall like them either, he was, in fact, a rare exception.  The first thing I did\non leaving school was to give up the special job for which I had been\ndestined so as to break all ties, to curse my past and shake the dust from\noff my feet ....  And goodness knows why, after all that, I should go\ntrudging off to Simonov’s!",
        "Early next morning I roused myself and jumped out of bed with\nexcitement, as though it were all about to happen at once.  But I believed\nthat some radical change in my life was coming, and would inevitably\ncome that day.  Owing to its rarity, perhaps, any external event, however\ntrivial, always made me feel as though some radical change in my life\nwere at hand.  I went to the office, however, as usual, but sneaked away\nhome two hours earlier to get ready.  The great thing, I thought, is not to\nbe the first to arrive, or they will think I am overjoyed at coming.  But\nthere were thousands of such great points to consider, and they all\nagitated and overwhelmed me.  I polished my boots a second time with\nmy own hands; nothing in the world would have induced Apollon to\nclean them twice a day, as he considered that it was more than his duties\nrequired of him.  I stole the brushes to clean them from the passage, being\ncareful he should not detect it, for fear of his contempt.  Then I minutely\nexamined my clothes and thought that everything looked old, worn and\nthreadbare.  I had let myself get too slovenly.  My uniform, perhaps, was\ntidy, but I could not go out to dinner in my uniform.  The worst of it was\nthat on the knee of my trousers was a big yellow stain.  I had a foreboding\nthat that stain would deprive me of nine-tenths of my personal dignity.  I\nknew, too, that it was very poor to think so.  “But this is no time for\nthinking: now I am in for the real thing,” I thought, and my heart sank.  I\nknew, too, perfectly well even then, that I was monstrously exaggerating\nthe facts.  But how could I help it?  I could not control myself and was\nalready shaking with fever.  With despair I pictured to myself how coldly\nand disdainfully that “scoundrel” Zverkov would meet me; with what\ndull-witted, invincible contempt the blockhead Trudolyubov would look\nat me; with what impudent rudeness the insect Ferfitchkin would snigger\nat me in order to curry favour with Zverkov; how completely Simonov\nwould take it all in, and how he would despise me for the abjectness of\nmy vanity and lack of spirit—and, worst of all, how paltry, UNLITERARY,\ncommonplace it would all be.  Of course, the best thing would be not to\ngo at all.  But that was most impossible of all: if I feel impelled to do\nanything, I seem to be pitchforked into it.  I should have jeered at myself\never afterwards: “So you funked it, you funked it, you funked the REAL\nTHING!” On the contrary, I passionately longed to show all that “rabble\"\nthat I was by no means such a spiritless creature as I seemed to myself. \nWhat is more, even in the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly fever, I\ndreamed of getting the upper hand, of dominating them, carrying them\naway, making them like me—if only for my “elevation of thought and\nunmistakable wit.”  They would abandon Zverkov, he would sit on one\nside, silent and ashamed, while I should crush him.  Then, perhaps, we\nwould be reconciled and drink to our everlasting friendship; but what was\nmost bitter and humiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully\nand for certain, that I needed nothing of all this really, that I did not really\nwant to crush, to subdue, to attract them, and that I did not care a straw\nreally for the result, even if I did achieve it.  Oh, how I prayed for the day\nto pass quickly!  In unutterable anguish I went to the window, opened the\nmovable pane and looked out into the troubled darkness of the thickly\nfalling wet snow.  At last my wretched little clock hissed out five.  I seized\nmy hat and, trying not to look at Apollon, who had been all day\nexpecting his month’s wages, but in his foolishness was unwilling to be\nthe first to speak about it, I slipped between him and the door and,\njumping into a high-class sledge, on which I spent my last half rouble, I\ndrove up in grand style to the Hotel de Paris.",
        "\nI had been certain the day before that I should be the first to arrive.  But it\nwas not a question of being the first to arrive.  Not only were they not\nthere, but I had difficulty in finding our room.  The table was not laid\neven.  What did it mean?  After a good many questions I elicited from the\nwaiters that the dinner had been ordered not for five, but for six o’clock.\nThis was confirmed at the buffet too.  I felt really ashamed to go on\nquestioning them.  It was only twenty-five minutes past five.  If they\nchanged the dinner hour they ought at least to have let me know—that is\nwhat the post is for, and not to have put me in an absurd position in my\nown eyes and ... and even before the waiters.  I sat down; the servant\nbegan laying the table; I felt even more humiliated when he was present. \nTowards six o’clock they brought in candles, though there were lamps\nburning in the room.  It had not occurred to the waiter, however, to bring\nthem in at once when I arrived.  In the next room two gloomy, angry-\nlooking persons were eating their dinners in silence at two different\ntables.  There was a great deal of noise, even shouting, in a room further\naway; one could hear the laughter of a crowd of people, and nasty little\nshrieks in French: there were ladies at the dinner.  It was sickening, in fact. \nI rarely passed more unpleasant moments, so much so that when they did\narrive all together punctually at six I was overjoyed to see them, as though\nthey were my deliverers, and even forgot that it was incumbent upon me\nto show resentment.",
        "Zverkov walked in at the head of them; evidently he was the leading\nspirit.  He and all of them were laughing; but, seeing me, Zverkov drew\nhimself up a little, walked up to me deliberately with a slight, rather jaunty\nbend from the waist.  He shook hands with me in a friendly, but not over-\nfriendly, fashion, with a sort of circumspect courtesy like that of a General,\nas though in giving me his hand he were warding off something.  I had\nimagined, on the contrary, that on coming in he would at once break into\nhis habitual thin, shrill laugh and fall to making his insipid jokes and\nwitticisms.  I had been preparing for them ever since the previous day, but I\nhad not expected such condescension, such high-official courtesy.  So,\nthen, he felt himself ineffably superior to me in every respect!  If he only\nmeant to insult me by that high-official tone, it would not matter, I\nthought—I could pay him back for it one way or another.  But what if, in\nreality, without the least desire to be offensive, that sheepshead had a\nnotion in earnest that he was superior to me and could only look at me in a\npatronising way?  The very supposition made me gasp.",
        "“I was surprised to hear of your desire to join us,” he began, lisping and\ndrawling, which was something new.  “You and I seem to have seen nothing of one\nanother.  You fight shy of us.  You shouldn’t.  We are not such terrible\npeople as you think.  Well, anyway, I am glad to renew our acquaintance.”",
        "And he turned carelessly to put down his hat on the window.",
        "“Have you been waiting long?” Trudolyubov inquired.",
        "“I arrived at five o’clock as you told me yesterday,” I answered aloud,\nwith an irritability that threatened an explosion.",
        "“Didn’t you let him know that we had changed the hour?” said\nTrudolyubov to Simonov.",
        "“No, I didn’t.  I forgot,” the latter replied, with no sign of regret,\nand without even apologising to me he went off to order the HORS D’OEUVRE.",
        "“So you’ve been here a whole hour?  Oh, poor fellow!” Zverkov cried\nironically, for to his notions this was bound to be extremely funny.  That\nrascal Ferfitchkin followed with his nasty little snigger like a puppy yapping.\nMy position struck him, too, as exquisitely ludicrous and embarrassing.",
        "“It isn’t funny at all!” I cried to Ferfitchkin, more and more irritated. \n\"It wasn’t my fault, but other people’s.  They neglected to let me know.  It\nwas ... it was ... it was simply absurd.”",
        "“It’s not only absurd, but something else as well,” muttered Trudolyubov,\nnaively taking my part.  “You are not hard enough upon it.  It was\nsimply rudeness—unintentional, of course.  And how could Simonov ... h’m!”",
        "“If a trick like that had been played on me,” observed Ferfitchkin, “I\nshould ...”",
        "“But you should have ordered something for yourself,” Zverkov interrupted,\n\"or simply asked for dinner without waiting for us.”",
        "“You will allow that I might have done that without your permission,\"\nI rapped out.  “If I waited, it was ...”",
        "“Let us sit down, gentlemen,” cried Simonov, coming in.  “Everything\nis ready; I can answer for the champagne; it is capitally frozen ....  You\nsee, I did not know your address, where was I to look for you?” he\nsuddenly turned to me, but again he seemed to avoid looking at me. \nEvidently he had something against me.  It must have been what\nhappened yesterday.",
        "All sat down; I did the same.  It was a round table.  Trudolyubov was on\nmy left, Simonov on my right, Zverkov was sitting opposite, Ferfitchkin\nnext to him, between him and Trudolyubov.",
        "“Tell me, are you ... in a government office?” Zverkov went on\nattending to me.  Seeing that I was embarrassed he seriously thought that\nhe ought to be friendly to me, and, so to speak, cheer me up.",
        "“Does he want me to throw a bottle at his head?” I thought, in a fury. \nIn my novel surroundings I was unnaturally ready to be irritated.",
        "“In the N—-xxxxxxxxxxxxx office,” I answered jerkily, with my eyes on my plate.",
        "“And ha-ave you a go-od berth?  I say, what ma-a-de you leave your\noriginal job?”",
        "“What ma-a-de me was that I wanted to leave my original job,” I\ndrawled more than he, hardly able to control myself.  Ferfitchkin went off\ninto a guffaw.  Simonov looked at me ironically.  Trudolyubov left off\neating and began looking at me with curiosity.",
        "Zverkov winced, but he tried not to notice it. ",
        "“And the remuneration?”",
        "“What remuneration?”",
        "“I mean, your sa-a-lary?”",
        "“Why are you cross-examining me?” However, I told him at once what\nmy salary was.  I turned horribly red.",
        "“It is not very handsome,” Zverkov observed majestically.",
        "“Yes, you can’t afford to dine at cafes on that,” Ferfitchkin\nadded insolently.",
        "“To my thinking it’s very poor,” Trudolyubov observed gravely.",
        "“And how thin you have grown!  How you have changed!” added\nZverkov, with a shade of venom in his voice, scanning me and my attire\nwith a sort of insolent compassion.",
        "“Oh, spare his blushes,” cried Ferfitchkin, sniggering.",
        "“My dear sir, allow me to tell you I am not blushing,” I broke out at\nlast; “do you hear?  I am dining here, at this cafe, at my own expense, not\nat other people’s—note that, Mr. Ferfitchkin.”",
        "“Wha-at?  Isn’t every one here dining at his own expense?  You would\nseem to be ...”  Ferfitchkin flew out at me, turning as red as a lobster,\nand looking me in the face with fury.\n\"Tha-at,” I answered, feeling I had gone too far, “and I imagine it\nwould be better to talk of something more intelligent.”",
        "“You intend to show off your intelligence, I suppose?”",
        "“Don’t disturb yourself, that would be quite out of place here.”",
        "“Why are you clacking away like that, my good sir, eh?  Have you gone\nout of your wits in your office?”",
        "“Enough, gentlemen, enough!” Zverkov cried, authoritatively.",
        "“How stupid it is!” muttered Simonov.",
        "“It really is stupid.  We have met here, a company of friends, for a\nfarewell dinner to a comrade and you carry on an altercation,” said\nTrudolyubov, rudely addressing himself to me alone.  “You invited yourself\nto join us, so don’t disturb the general harmony.”",
        "“Enough, enough!” cried Zverkov.  “Give over, gentlemen, it’s out of\nplace.  Better let me tell you how I nearly got married the day before\nyesterday ....”",
        "And then followed a burlesque narrative of how this gentleman had\nalmost been married two days before.  There was not a word about the\nmarriage, however, but the story was adorned with generals, colonels and\nkammer-junkers, while Zverkov almost took the lead among them.  It was\ngreeted with approving laughter; Ferfitchkin positively squealed.",
        "No one paid any attention to me, and I sat crushed and humiliated.",
        "“Good Heavens, these are not the people for me!” I thought.  “And\nwhat a fool I have made of myself before them!  I let Ferfitchkin go too far,\nthough.  The brutes imagine they are doing me an honour in letting me\nsit down with them.  They don’t understand that it’s an honour to them\nand not to me!  I’ve grown thinner!  My clothes!  Oh, damn my trousers!\nZverkov noticed the yellow stain on the knee as soon as he came in ....\nBut what’s the use!  I must get up at once, this very minute, take my hat\nand simply go without a word ... with contempt!  And tomorrow I can\nsend a challenge.  The scoundrels!  As though I cared about the seven\nroubles.  They may think ....  Damn it!  I don’t care about the seven\nroubles.  I’ll go this minute!”",
        "Of course I remained.  I drank sherry and Lafitte by the glassful in my\ndiscomfiture.  Being unaccustomed to it, I was quickly affected.  My\nannoyance increased as the wine went to my head.  I longed all at once to\ninsult them all in a most flagrant manner and then go away.  To seize the\nmoment and show what I could do, so that they would say, “He’s clever,\nthough he is absurd,” and ... and ... in fact, damn them all!",
        "I scanned them all insolently with my drowsy eyes.  But they seemed to\nhave forgotten me altogether.  They were noisy, vociferous, cheerful. \nZverkov was talking all the time.  I began listening.  Zverkov was talking of\nsome exuberant lady whom he had at last led on to declaring her love (of\ncourse, he was lying like a horse), and how he had been helped in this\naffair by an intimate friend of his, a Prince Kolya, an officer in the\nhussars, who had three thousand serfs.",
        "“And yet this Kolya, who has three thousand serfs, has not put in an\nappearance here tonight to see you off,” I cut in suddenly.",
        "For one minute every one was silent.  “You are drunk already.\"\nTrudolyubov deigned to notice me at last, glancing contemptuously in my\ndirection.  Zverkov, without a word, examined me as though I were an insect.\nI dropped my eyes.  Simonov made haste to fill up the glasses with champagne.",
        "Trudolyubov raised his glass, as did everyone else but me.",
        "“Your health and good luck on the journey!” he cried to Zverkov.  “To\nold times, to our future, hurrah!”",
        "They all tossed off their glasses, and crowded round Zverkov to kiss\nhim.  I did not move; my full glass stood untouched before me.",
        "“Why, aren’t you going to drink it?” roared Trudolyubov, losing patience\nand turning menacingly to me.",
        "“I want to make a speech separately, on my own account ... and then\nI’ll drink it, Mr. Trudolyubov.”",
        "“Spiteful brute!” muttered Simonov.  I drew myself up in my chair and\nfeverishly seized my glass, prepared for something extraordinary, though\nI did not know myself precisely what I was going to say.",
        "“SILENCE!” cried Ferfitchkin.  “Now for a display of wit!”",
        "Zverkov waited very gravely, knowing what was coming.",
        "“Mr. Lieutenant Zverkov,” I began, “let me tell you that I hate\nphrases, phrasemongers and men in corsets ... that’s the first point, and\nthere is a second one to follow it.”",
        "There was a general stir.",
        "“The second point is: I hate ribaldry and ribald talkers.  Especially\nribald talkers!  The third point: I love justice, truth and honesty.”  I went\non almost mechanically, for I was beginning to shiver with horror myself\nand had no idea how I came to be talking like this.  “I love thought,\nMonsieur Zverkov; I love true comradeship, on an equal footing and\nnot ... H’m ... I love ... But, however, why not?  I will drink your\nhealth, too, Mr. Zverkov.  Seduce the Circassian girls, shoot the enemies\nof the fatherland and ... and ... to your health, Monsieur Zverkov!”",
        "Zverkov got up from his seat, bowed to me and said:",
        "“I am very much obliged to you.”  He was frightfully offended and\nturned pale.",
        "“Damn the fellow!” roared Trudolyubov, bringing his fist down on\nthe table.",
        "“Well, he wants a punch in the face for that,” squealed Ferfitchkin.",
        "“We ought to turn him out,” muttered Simonov.",
        "“Not a word, gentlemen, not a movement!” cried Zverkov solemnly,\nchecking the general indignation.  “I thank you all, but I can show him\nfor myself how much value I attach to his words.”",
        "“Mr.  Ferfitchkin, you will give me satisfaction tomorrow for your\nwords just now!” I said aloud, turning with dignity to Ferfitchkin.",
        "“A duel, you mean?  Certainly,” he answered.  But probably I was\nso ridiculous as I challenged him and it was so out of keeping with\nmy appearance that everyone including Ferfitchkin was prostrate with laughter.",
        "“Yes, let him alone, of course!  He is quite drunk,” Trudolyubov said\nwith disgust.",
        "“I shall never forgive myself for letting him join us,” Simonov\nmuttered again.",
        "“Now is the time to throw a bottle at their heads,” I thought to myself.\nI picked up the bottle ... and filled my glass ....  “No, I’d better sit\non to the end,” I went on thinking; “you would be pleased, my friends, if I\nwent away.  Nothing will induce me to go.  I’ll go on sitting here and\ndrinking to the end, on purpose, as a sign that I don’t think you of the\nslightest consequence.  I will go on sitting and drinking, because this is a\npublic-house and I paid my entrance money.  I’ll sit here and drink, for I\nlook upon you as so many pawns, as inanimate pawns.  I’ll sit here and\ndrink ... and sing if I want to, yes, sing, for I have the right to ... to\nsing ...  H’m!”",
        "But I did not sing.  I simply tried not to look at any of them.  I assumed\nmost unconcerned attitudes and waited with impatience for them to\nspeak FIRST.  But alas, they did not address me!  And oh, how I wished, how\nI wished at that moment to be reconciled to them!  It struck eight, at last\nnine.  They moved from the table to the sofa.  Zverkov stretched himself\non a lounge and put one foot on a round table.  Wine was brought there. \nHe did, as a fact, order three bottles on his own account.  I, of course, was\nnot invited to join them.  They all sat round him on the sofa.  They\nlistened to him, almost with reverence.  It was evident that they were fond\nof him.  “What for?  What for?” I wondered.  From time to time they were\nmoved to drunken enthusiasm and kissed each other.  They talked of the\nCaucasus, of the nature of true passion, of snug berths in the service, of\nthe income of an hussar called Podharzhevsky, whom none of them knew\npersonally, and rejoiced in the largeness of it, of the extraordinary grace\nand beauty of a Princess D., whom none of them had ever seen; then it\ncame to Shakespeare’s being immortal.",
        "I smiled contemptuously and walked up and down the other side of the\nroom, opposite the sofa, from the table to the stove and back again.  I tried\nmy very utmost to show them that I could do without them, and yet I\npurposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with my heels.  But it\nwas all in vain.  They paid no attention.  I had the patience to walk up and\ndown in front of them from eight o’clock till eleven, in the same place,\nfrom the table to the stove and back again.  “I walk up and down to please\nmyself and no one can prevent me.”  The waiter who came into the room\nstopped, from time to time, to look at me.  I was somewhat giddy from\nturning round so often; at moments it seemed to me that I was in\ndelirium.  During those three hours I was three times soaked with sweat\nand dry again.  At times, with an intense, acute pang I was stabbed to the\nheart by the thought that ten years, twenty years, forty years would pass,\nand that even in forty years I would remember with loathing and humiliation\nthose filthiest, most ludicrous, and most awful moments of my life. \nNo one could have gone out of his way to degrade himself more shamelessly,\nand I fully realised it, fully, and yet I went on pacing up and down\nfrom the table to the stove.  “Oh, if you only knew what thoughts and\nfeelings I am capable of, how cultured I am!” I thought at moments,\nmentally addressing the sofa on which my enemies were sitting.  But my\nenemies behaved as though I were not in the room.  Once—only once—\nthey turned towards me, just when Zverkov was talking about Shakespeare,\nand I suddenly gave a contemptuous laugh.  I laughed in such an\naffected and disgusting way that they all at once broke off their conversation,\nand silently and gravely for two minutes watched me walking up and\ndown from the table to the stove, TAKING NO NOTICE OF THEM.  But nothing\ncame of it: they said nothing, and two minutes later they ceased to notice\nme again.  It struck eleven.",
        "“Friends,” cried Zverkov getting up from the sofa, “let us all be off\nnow, THERE!”",
        "“Of course, of course,” the others assented.  I turned sharply to\nZverkov.  I was so harassed, so exhausted, that I would have cut my throat\nto put an end to it.  I was in a fever; my hair, soaked with perspiration,\nstuck to my forehead and temples.",
        "“Zverkov, I beg your pardon,” I said abruptly and resolutely.\n\"Ferfitchkin, yours too, and everyone’s, everyone’s: I have insulted you all!”",
        "“Aha!  A duel is not in your line, old man,” Ferfitchkin\nhissed venomously.",
        "It sent a sharp pang to my heart.",
        "“No, it’s not the duel I am afraid of, Ferfitchkin!  I am ready to fight\nyou tomorrow, after we are reconciled.  I insist upon it, in fact, and you\ncannot refuse.  I want to show you that I am not afraid of a duel.  You shall\nfire first and I shall fire into the air.”",
        "“He is comforting himself,” said Simonov.",
        "“He’s simply raving,” said Trudolyubov.",
        "“But let us pass.  Why are you barring our way?  What do you want?\"\nZverkov answered disdainfully.\nThey were all flushed, their eyes were bright: they had been\ndrinking heavily.",
        "“I ask for your friendship, Zverkov; I insulted you, but ...”",
        "“Insulted?  YOU insulted ME?  Understand, sir, that you never, under any\ncircumstances, could possibly insult ME.”",
        "“And that’s enough for you.  Out of the way!” concluded Trudolyubov.",
        "“Olympia is mine, friends, that’s agreed!” cried Zverkov.",
        "“We won’t dispute your right, we won’t dispute your right,” the others\nanswered, laughing.",
        "I stood as though spat upon.  The party went noisily out of the room. \nTrudolyubov struck up some stupid song.  Simonov remained behind for\na moment to tip the waiters.  I suddenly went up to him.",
        "“Simonov!  give me six roubles!” I said, with desperate resolution.",
        "He looked at me in extreme amazement, with vacant eyes.   He, too,\nwas drunk.",
        "“You don’t mean you are coming with us?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“I’ve no money,” he snapped out, and with a scornful laugh he went\nout of the room.",
        "I clutched at his overcoat.  It was a nightmare.",
        "“Simonov, I saw you had money.  Why do you refuse me?  Am I a\nscoundrel?  Beware of refusing me: if you knew, if you knew why I am\nasking!  My whole future, my whole plans depend upon it!”",
        "Simonov pulled out the money and almost flung it at me.",
        "“Take it, if you have no sense of shame!” he pronounced pitilessly, and\nran to overtake them.",
        "I was left for a moment alone.  Disorder, the remains of dinner, a\nbroken wine-glass on the floor, spilt wine, cigarette ends, fumes of drink\nand delirium in my brain, an agonising misery in my heart and finally\nthe waiter, who had seen and heard all and was looking inquisitively into\nmy face.",
        "“I am going there!” I cried.  “Either they shall all go down on their\nknees to beg for my friendship, or I will give Zverkov a slap in the face!”",
        "“So this is it, this is it at last—contact with real life,” I muttered as I ran\nheadlong downstairs.  “This is very different from the Pope’s leaving Rome\nand going to Brazil, very different from the ball on Lake Como!”",
        "“You are a scoundrel,” a thought flashed through my mind, “if you\nlaugh at this now.”",
        "“No matter!” I cried, answering myself.  “Now everything is lost!”",
        "There was no trace to be seen of them, but that made no difference—I\nknew where they had gone.",
        "At the steps was standing a solitary night sledge-driver in a rough\npeasant coat, powdered over with the still falling, wet, and as it were\nwarm, snow.  It was hot and steamy.  The little shaggy piebald horse was\nalso covered with snow and coughing, I remember that very well.  I made\na rush for the roughly made sledge; but as soon as I raised my foot to get\ninto it, the recollection of how Simonov had just given me six roubles\nseemed to double me up and I tumbled into the sledge like a sack.",
        "“No, I must do a great deal to make up for all that,” I cried.  “But I will\nmake up for it or perish on the spot this very night.  Start!”",
        "We set off.  There was a perfect whirl in my head.",
        "“They won’t go down on their knees to beg for my friendship.  That is a\nmirage, cheap mirage, revolting, romantic and fantastical—that’s another\nball on Lake Como.  And so I am bound to slap Zverkov’s face!  It is\nmy duty to.  And so it is settled; I am flying to give him a slap in the face. \nHurry up!”",
        "The driver tugged at the reins.",
        "“As soon as I go in I’ll give it him.  Ought I before giving him the slap\nto say a few words by way of preface?  No. I’ll simply go in and give it him.\nThey will all be sitting in the drawing-room, and he with Olympia on the\nsofa.  That damned Olympia!  She laughed at my looks on one occasion\nand refused me.  I’ll pull Olympia’s hair, pull Zverkov’s ears!  No, better\none ear, and pull him by it round the room.  Maybe they will all begin\nbeating me and will kick me out.  That’s most likely, indeed.  No matter!\nAnyway, I shall first slap him; the initiative will be mine; and by the laws\nof honour that is everything: he will be branded and cannot wipe off the\nslap by any blows, by nothing but a duel.  He will be forced to fight.  And\nlet them beat me now.  Let them, the ungrateful wretches!  Trudolyubov\nwill beat me hardest, he is so strong; Ferfitchkin will be sure to catch hold\nsideways and tug at my hair.  But no matter, no matter!  That’s what I am\ngoing for.  The blockheads will be forced at last to see the tragedy of it all!\nWhen they drag me to the door I shall call out to them that in reality they\nare not worth my little finger.  Get on, driver, get on!” I cried to the driver. \nHe started and flicked his whip, I shouted so savagely.",
        "“We shall fight at daybreak, that’s a settled thing.  I’ve done with the\noffice.  Ferfitchkin made a joke about it just now.  But where can I get\npistols?  Nonsense!  I’ll get my salary in advance and buy them.  And\npowder, and bullets?  That’s the second’s business.  And how can it all be\ndone by daybreak?  and where am I to get a second?  I have no friends. \nNonsense!” I cried, lashing myself up more and more.  “It’s of no consequence!\nThe first person I meet in the street is bound to be my second, just\nas he would be bound to pull a drowning man out of water.  The most\neccentric things may happen.  Even if I were to ask the director himself to\nbe my second tomorrow, he would be bound to consent, if only from a\nfeeling of chivalry, and to keep the secret!  Anton Antonitch ....”",
        "The fact is, that at that very minute the disgusting absurdity of my plan\nand the other side of the question was clearer and more vivid to my\nimagination than it could be to anyone on earth.  But ....",
        "“Get on, driver, get on, you rascal, get on!”",
        "“Ugh, sir!” said the son of toil.",
        "Cold shivers suddenly ran down me.  Wouldn’t it be better ... to go\nstraight home?  My God, my God!  Why did I invite myself to this dinner\nyesterday?  But no, it’s impossible.  And my walking up and down for three\nhours from the table to the stove?  No, they, they and no one else must\npay for my walking up and down!  They must wipe out this dishonour!\nDrive on!",
        "And what if they give me into custody?  They won’t dare!  They’ll be\nafraid of the scandal.  And what if Zverkov is so contemptuous that he\nrefuses to fight a duel?  He is sure to; but in that case I’ll show them ... I\nwill turn up at the posting station when he’s setting off tomorrow, I’ll\ncatch him by the leg, I’ll pull off his coat when he gets into the carriage. \nI’ll get my teeth into his hand, I’ll bite him.  “See what lengths you can\ndrive a desperate man to!” He may hit me on the head and they may\nbelabour me from behind.  I will shout to the assembled multitude:\n\"Look at this young puppy who is driving off to captivate the Circassian\ngirls after letting me spit in his face!”",
        "Of course, after that everything will be over!  The office will have\nvanished off the face of the earth.  I shall be arrested, I shall be tried, I\nshall be dismissed from the service, thrown in prison, sent to Siberia. \nNever mind!  In fifteen years when they let me out of prison I will trudge\noff to him, a beggar, in rags.  I shall find him in some provincial town.  He\nwill be married and happy.  He will have a grown-up daughter .... I shall\nsay to him: “Look, monster, at my hollow cheeks and my rags!  I’ve lost\neverything—my career, my happiness, art, science, THE WOMAN I LOVED,\nand all through you.  Here are pistols.  I have come to discharge my pistol\nand ... and I ... forgive you.  Then I shall fire into the air and he will\nhear nothing more of me ....”",
        "I was actually on the point of tears, though I knew perfectly well at that\nmoment that all this was out of Pushkin’s SILVIO and Lermontov’s MASQUERADE.\nAnd all at once I felt horribly ashamed, so ashamed that I\nstopped the horse, got out of the sledge, and stood still in the snow in the\nmiddle of the street.  The driver gazed at me, sighing and astonished.",
        "What was I to do?  I could not go on there—it was evidently stupid,\nand I could not leave things as they were, because that would seem as\nthough ... Heavens, how could I leave things!  And after such insults!\n\"No!” I cried, throwing myself into the sledge again.  “It is ordained!  It is\nfate!  Drive on, drive on!”",
        "And in my impatience I punched the sledge-driver on the back of the neck.",
        "“What are you up to?  What are you hitting me for?” the peasant\nshouted, but he whipped up his nag so that it began kicking.",
        "The wet snow was falling in big flakes; I unbuttoned myself, regardless\nof it.  I forgot everything else, for I had finally decided on the slap, and\nfelt with horror that it was going to happen NOW, AT ONCE, and that NO FORCE\nCOULD STOP IT.  The deserted street lamps gleamed sullenly in the snowy\ndarkness like torches at a funeral.  The snow drifted under my great-coat,\nunder my coat, under my cravat, and melted there.  I did not wrap myself\nup—all was lost, anyway.",
        "At last we arrived.  I jumped out, almost unconscious, ran up the steps\nand began knocking and kicking at the door.  I felt fearfully weak,\nparticularly in my legs and knees.  The door was opened quickly as\nthough they knew I was coming.  As a fact, Simonov had warned them\nthat perhaps another gentleman would arrive, and this was a place in\nwhich one had to give notice and to observe certain precautions.  It was\none of those “millinery establishments” which were abolished by the\npolice a good time ago.  By day it really was a shop; but at night, if one had\nan introduction, one might visit it for other purposes.",
        "I walked rapidly through the dark shop into the familiar drawing-\nroom, where there was only one candle burning, and stood still in\namazement: there was no one there.  “Where are they?” I asked somebody. \nBut by now, of course, they had separated.  Before me was standing a\nperson with a stupid smile, the “madam” herself, who had seen me\nbefore.  A minute later a door opened and another person came in.",
        "Taking no notice of anything I strode about the room, and, I believe, I\ntalked to myself.  I felt as though I had been saved from death and was\nconscious of this, joyfully, all over: I should have given that slap, I should\ncertainly, certainly have given it!  But now they were not here and ...\neverything had vanished and changed!  I looked round.  I could not realise\nmy condition yet.  I looked mechanically at the girl who had come in: and\nhad a glimpse of a fresh, young, rather pale face, with straight, dark\neyebrows, and with grave, as it were wondering, eyes that attracted me at\nonce; I should have hated her if she had been smiling.  I began looking at\nher more intently and, as it were, with effort.  I had not fully collected my\nthoughts.  There was something simple and good-natured in her face, but\nsomething strangely grave.  I am sure that this stood in her way here, and\nno one of those fools had noticed her.  She could not, however, have been\ncalled a beauty, though she was tall, strong-looking, and well built.  She\nwas very simply dressed.  Something loathsome stirred within me.  I went\nstraight up to her.",
        "I chanced to look into the glass.  My harassed face struck me as\nrevolting in the extreme, pale, angry, abject, with dishevelled hair.  “No\nmatter, I am glad of it,” I thought; “I am glad that I shall seem repulsive\nto her; I like that.”",
        "\n...  Somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing, as though\noppressed by something, as though someone were strangling it.  After an\nunnaturally prolonged wheezing there followed a shrill, nasty, and as it\nwere unexpectedly rapid, chime—as though someone were suddenly\njumping forward.  It struck two.  I woke up, though I had indeed not been\nasleep but lying half-conscious.",
        "It was almost completely dark in the narrow, cramped, low-pitched\nroom, cumbered up with an enormous wardrobe and piles of cardboard\nboxes and all sorts of frippery and litter.  The candle end that had been\nburning on the table was going out and gave a faint flicker from time to\ntime.  In a few minutes there would be complete darkness.",
        "I was not long in coming to myself; everything came back to my mind\nat once, without an effort, as though it had been in ambush to pounce\nupon me again.  And, indeed, even while I was unconscious a point\nseemed continually to remain in my memory unforgotten, and round it\nmy dreams moved drearily.  But strange to say, everything that had\nhappened to me in that day seemed to me now, on waking, to be in the\nfar, far away past, as though I had long, long ago lived all that down.",
        "My head was full of fumes.  Something seemed to be hovering over\nme, rousing me, exciting me, and making me restless.  Misery and spite\nseemed surging up in me again and seeking an outlet.  Suddenly I saw\nbeside me two wide open eyes scrutinising me curiously and persistently. \nThe look in those eyes was coldly detached, sullen, as it were utterly\nremote; it weighed upon me.",
        "A grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body, as a\nhorrible sensation, such as one feels when one goes into a damp and\nmouldy cellar.  There was something unnatural in those two eyes,\nbeginning to look at me only now.  I recalled, too, that during those two\nhours I had not said a single word to this creature, and had, in fact,\nconsidered it utterly superfluous; in fact, the silence had for some reason\ngratified me.  Now I suddenly realised vividly the hideous idea—\nrevolting as a spider—of vice, which, without love, grossly and shamelessly\nbegins with that in which true love finds its consummation.  For a long time\nwe gazed at each other like that, but she did not drop her eyes before mine\nand her expression did not change, so that at last I felt uncomfortable.",
        "“What is your name?” I asked abruptly, to put an end to it.",
        "“Liza,” she answered almost in a whisper, but somehow far from\ngraciously, and she turned her eyes away.",
        "I was silent.",
        "“What weather!  The snow ... it’s disgusting!” I said, almost to myself,\nputting my arm under my head despondently, and gazing at the ceiling.",
        "She made no answer.  This was horrible.",
        "“Have you always lived in Petersburg?” I asked a minute later, almost\nangrily, turning my head slightly towards her.",
        "“No.”",
        "“Where do you come from?”",
        "“From Riga,” she answered reluctantly.",
        "“Are you a German?”",
        "“No, Russian.”",
        "“Have you been here long?”",
        "“Where?”",
        "“In this house?”",
        "“A fortnight.”",
        "She spoke more and more jerkily.  The candle went out; I could no\nlonger distinguish her face.",
        "“Have you a father and mother?”",
        "“Yes ... no ... I have.”",
        "“Where are they?”",
        "“There ... in Riga.”",
        "“What are they?”",
        "“Oh, nothing.”",
        "“Nothing?  Why, what class are they?”",
        "“Tradespeople.”",
        "“Have you always lived with them?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“How old are you?”",
        "“Twenty.\"\n\"Why did you leave them?”",
        "“Oh, for no reason.”",
        "That answer meant “Let me alone; I feel sick, sad.”",
        "We were silent.",
        "God knows why I did not go away.  I felt myself more and more sick and\ndreary.  The images of the previous day began of themselves, apart from\nmy will, flitting through my memory in confusion.  I suddenly recalled\nsomething I had seen that morning when, full of anxious thoughts, I was\nhurrying to the office.",
        "“I saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped\nit,” I suddenly said aloud, not that I desired to open the conversation, but\nas it were by accident.",
        "“A coffin?”",
        "“Yes, in the Haymarket; they were bringing it up out of a cellar.”",
        "“From a cellar?”",
        "“Not from a cellar, but a basement.  Oh, you know ... down below ... from\na house of ill-fame.  It was filthy all round ...  Egg-shells, litter ...\na stench.  It was loathsome.”",
        "Silence.",
        "“A nasty day to be buried,” I began, simply to avoid being silent.",
        "“Nasty, in what way?”",
        "“The snow, the wet.”  (I yawned.)",
        "“It makes no difference,” she said suddenly, after a brief silence.",
        "“No, it’s horrid.”  (I yawned again).  “The gravediggers must have sworn\nat getting drenched by the snow.  And there must have been water in the grave.”",
        "“Why water in the grave?” she asked, with a sort of curiosity, but\nspeaking even more harshly and abruptly than before. ",
        "I suddenly began to feel provoked.",
        "“Why, there must have been water at the bottom a foot deep.  You can’t\ndig a dry grave in Volkovo Cemetery.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Why?  Why, the place is waterlogged.  It’s a regular marsh.  So they\nbury them in water.  I’ve seen it myself ... many times.”",
        "(I had never seen it once, indeed I had never been in Volkovo, and had\nonly heard stories of it.)",
        "“Do you mean to say, you don’t mind how you die?”",
        "“But why should I die?” she answered, as though defending herself.",
        "“Why, some day you will die, and you will die just the same as that\ndead woman.  She was ... a girl like you.  She died of consumption.”",
        "“A wench would have died in hospital ...”  (She knows all about it\nalready: she said “wench,” not “girl.”)",
        "“She was in debt to her madam,” I retorted, more and more provoked\nby the discussion; “and went on earning money for her up to the end,\nthough she was in consumption.  Some sledge-drivers standing by were\ntalking about her to some soldiers and telling them so.  No doubt they\nknew her.  They were laughing.  They were going to meet in a pot-house\nto drink to her memory.”",
        "A great deal of this was my invention.  Silence followed, profound\nsilence.  She did not stir.",
        "“And is it better to die in a hospital?”",
        "“Isn’t it just the same?  Besides, why should I die?” she added irritably.",
        "“If not now, a little later.”",
        "“Why a little later?”",
        "“Why, indeed?  Now you are young, pretty, fresh, you fetch a high\nprice.  But after another year of this life you will be very different—you\nwill go off.”",
        "“In a year?”",
        "“Anyway, in a year you will be worth less,” I continued malignantly. \n\"You will go from here to something lower, another house; a year later—\nto a third, lower and lower, and in seven years you will come to a\nbasement in the Haymarket.  That will be if you were lucky.  But it would\nbe much worse if you got some disease, consumption, say ... and caught\na chill, or something or other.  It’s not easy to get over an illness in your\nway of life.  If you catch anything you may not get rid of it.  And so you\nwould die.”",
        "“Oh, well, then I shall die,” she answered, quite vindictively, and she\nmade a quick movement.",
        "“But one is sorry.”",
        "“Sorry for whom?”",
        "“Sorry for life.\"\nSilence.",
        "“Have you been engaged to be married?  Eh?”",
        "“What’s that to you?”",
        "“Oh, I am not cross-examining you.  It’s nothing to me.  Why are you\nso cross?  Of course you may have had your own troubles.  What is it to\nme?  It’s simply that I felt sorry.”",
        "“Sorry for whom?”",
        "“Sorry for you.”",
        "“No need,” she whispered hardly audibly, and again made a faint movement.",
        "That incensed me at once.  What!  I was so gentle with her, and she ....",
        "“Why, do you think that you are on the right path?”",
        "“I don’t think anything.”",
        "“That’s what’s wrong, that you don’t think.  Realise it while there is still\ntime.  There still is time.  You are still young, good-looking; you might\nlove, be married, be happy ....”",
        "“Not all married women are happy,” she snapped out in the rude\nabrupt tone she had used at first.",
        "“Not all, of course, but anyway it is much better than the life here. \nInfinitely better.  Besides, with love one can live even without happiness. \nEven in sorrow life is sweet; life is sweet, however one lives.  But here what\nis there but ... foulness?  Phew!”",
        "I turned away with disgust; I was no longer reasoning coldly.  I began to\nfeel myself what I was saying and warmed to the subject.  I was already\nlonging to expound the cherished ideas I had brooded over in my corner. \nSomething suddenly flared up in me.  An object had appeared before me.",
        "“Never mind my being here, I am not an example for you.  I am,\nperhaps, worse than you are.  I was drunk when I came here, though,” I\nhastened, however, to say in self-defence.  “Besides, a man is no example\nfor a woman.  It’s a different thing.  I may degrade and defile myself, but I\nam not anyone’s slave.  I come and go, and that’s an end of it.  I shake it off,\nand I am a different man.  But you are a slave from the start.  Yes, a slave!\nYou give up everything, your whole freedom.  If you want to break your\nchains afterwards, you won’t be able to; you will be more and more fast in\nthe snares.  It is an accursed bondage.  I know it.  I won’t speak of anything\nelse, maybe you won’t understand, but tell me: no doubt you are in debt\nto your madam?  There, you see,” I added, though she made no answer,\nbut only listened in silence, entirely absorbed, “that’s a bondage for you!\nYou will never buy your freedom.  They will see to that.  It’s like selling\nyour soul to the devil ....  And besides ... perhaps, I too, am just as\nunlucky—how do you know—and wallow in the mud on purpose, out of\nmisery?  You know, men take to drink from grief; well, maybe I am here\nfrom grief.  Come, tell me, what is there good here?  Here you and I ...\ncame together ... just now and did not say one word to one another all\nthe time, and it was only afterwards you began staring at me like a wild\ncreature, and I at you.  Is that loving?  Is that how one human being\nshould meet another?  It’s hideous, that’s what it is!”",
        "“Yes!” she assented sharply and hurriedly.",
        "I was positively astounded by the promptitude of this “Yes.”  So the\nsame thought may have been straying through her mind when she was\nstaring at me just before.  So she, too, was capable of certain thoughts?\n\"Damn it all, this was interesting, this was a point of likeness!” I thought,\nalmost rubbing my hands.  And indeed it’s easy to turn a young soul\nlike that!",
        "It was the exercise of my power that attracted me most.",
        "She turned her head nearer to me, and it seemed to me in the darkness\nthat she propped herself on her arm.  Perhaps she was scrutinising me. \nHow I regretted that I could not see her eyes.  I heard her deep breathing.",
        "“Why have you come here?” I asked her, with a note of authority\nalready in my voice.",
        "“Oh, I don’t know.”",
        "“But how nice it would be to be living in your father’s house!  It’s warm\nand free; you have a home of your own.”",
        "“But what if it’s worse than this?”",
        "“I must take the right tone,” flashed through my mind.  “I may not get\nfar with sentimentality.”  But it was only a momentary thought.  I swear\nshe really did interest me.  Besides, I was exhausted and moody.  And\ncunning so easily goes hand-in-hand with feeling.",
        "“Who denies it!” I hastened to answer.  “Anything may happen.  I am\nconvinced that someone has wronged you, and that you are more sinned\nagainst than sinning.  Of course, I know nothing of your story, but it’s not\nlikely a girl like you has come here of her own inclination ....”",
        "“A girl like me?” she whispered, hardly audibly; but I heard it.",
        "Damn it all, I was flattering her.  That was horrid.  But perhaps it was a\ngood thing ....  She was silent.",
        "“See, Liza, I will tell you about myself.  If I had had a home from\nchildhood, I shouldn’t be what I am now.  I often think that.  However bad\nit may be at home, anyway they are your father and mother, and not\nenemies, strangers.  Once a year at least, they’ll show their love of you. \nAnyway, you know you are at home.  I grew up without a home; and\nperhaps that’s why I’ve turned so ... unfeeling.”",
        "I waited again.  “Perhaps she doesn’t understand,” I thought, “and,\nindeed, it is absurd—it’s moralising.”",
        "“If I were a father and had a daughter, I believe I should love my\ndaughter more than my sons, really,” I began indirectly, as though talking\nof something else, to distract her attention.  I must confess I blushed.",
        "“Why so?” she asked.",
        "Ah!  so she was listening!",
        "“I don’t know, Liza.  I knew a father who was a stern, austere man, but\nused to go down on his knees to his daughter, used to kiss her hands, her\nfeet, he couldn’t make enough of her, really.  When she danced at parties\nhe used to stand for five hours at a stretch, gazing at her.  He was mad over\nher: I understand that!  She would fall asleep tired at night, and he would\nwake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of the cross over her.  He\nwould go about in a dirty old coat, he was stingy to everyone else, but\nwould spend his last penny for her, giving her expensive presents, and it\nwas his greatest delight when she was pleased with what he gave her. \nFathers always love their daughters more than the mothers do.  Some girls\nlive happily at home!  And I believe I should never let my daughters marry.”",
        "“What next?” she said, with a faint smile.",
        "“I should be jealous, I really should.  To think that she should kiss\nanyone else!  That she should love a stranger more than her father!  It’s\npainful to imagine it.  Of course, that’s all nonsense, of course every\nfather would be reasonable at last.  But I believe before I should let her\nmarry, I should worry myself to death; I should find fault with all her\nsuitors.  But I should end by letting her marry whom she herself loved. \nThe one whom the daughter loves always seems the worst to the father,\nyou know.  That is always so.  So many family troubles come from that.”",
        "“Some are glad to sell their daughters, rather than marrying\nthem honourably.”",
        "Ah, so that was it!",
        "“Such a thing, Liza, happens in those accursed families in which\nthere is neither love nor God,” I retorted warmly, “and where there is no\nlove, there is no sense either.  There are such families, it’s true, but I am\nnot speaking of them.  You must have seen wickedness in your own\nfamily, if you talk like that.  Truly, you must have been unlucky.  H’m! ...\nthat sort of thing mostly comes about through poverty.”",
        "“And is it any better with the gentry?  Even among the poor, honest\npeople who live happily?”",
        "“H’m ... yes.  Perhaps.  Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning\nup his troubles, but does not count his joys.  If he counted them up as he\nought, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it. \nAnd what if all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God is upon it,\nif the husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you, never leaves you!\nThere is happiness in such a family!  Even sometimes there is happiness\nin the midst of sorrow; and indeed sorrow is everywhere.  If you marry YOU\nWILL FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF.  But think of the first years of married life with\none you love: what happiness, what happiness there sometimes is in it!\nAnd indeed it’s the ordinary thing.  In those early days even quarrels with\none’s husband end happily.  Some women get up quarrels with their\nhusbands just because they love them.  Indeed, I knew a woman like that:\nshe seemed to say that because she loved him, she would torment him\nand make him feel it.  You know that you may torment a man on purpose\nthrough love.  Women are particularly given to that, thinking to themselves\n’I will love him so, I will make so much of him afterwards, that it’s\nno sin to torment him a little now.’ And all in the  house rejoice in the\nsight of you, and you are happy and gay and peaceful and honourable ....\nThen there are some women who are jealous.  If he went off\nanywhere—I knew one such woman, she couldn’t restrain herself, but\nwould jump up at night and run off on the sly to find out where he was,\nwhether he was with some other woman.  That’s a pity.  And the woman\nknows herself it’s wrong, and her heart fails her and she suffers, but she\nloves—it’s all through love.  And how sweet it is to make up after quarrels,\nto own herself in the wrong or to forgive him!  And they both are so happy\nall at once—as though they had met anew, been married over again; as\nthough their love had begun afresh.  And no one, no one should know\nwhat passes between husband and wife if they love one another.  And\nwhatever quarrels there may be between them they ought not to call in\ntheir own mother to judge between them and tell tales of one another. \nThey are their own judges.  Love is a holy mystery and ought to be hidden\nfrom all other eyes, whatever happens.  That makes it holier and better. \nThey respect one another more, and much is built on respect.  And if\nonce there has been love, if they have been married for love, why should\nlove pass away?  Surely one can keep it!  It is rare that one cannot keep it. \nAnd if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last?\nThe first phase of married love will pass, it is true, but then there will\ncome a love that is better still.  Then there will be the union of souls, they\nwill have everything in common, there will be no secrets between them. \nAnd once they have children, the most difficult times will seem to them\nhappy, so long as there is love and courage.  Even toil will be a joy, you\nmay deny yourself bread for your children and even that will be a joy,\nThey will love you for it afterwards; so you are laying by for your future. \nAs the children grow up you feel that you are an example, a support for\nthem; that even after you die your children will always keep your\nthoughts and feelings, because they have received them from you, they\nwill take on your semblance and likeness.  So you see this is a great duty. \nHow can it fail to draw the father and mother nearer?  People say it’s a trial\nto have children.  Who says that?  It is heavenly happiness!  Are you fond of\nlittle children, Liza?  I am awfully fond of them.  You know—a little rosy\nbaby boy at your bosom, and what husband’s heart is not touched, seeing\nhis wife nursing his child!  A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and\nsnuggling, chubby little hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that\nit makes one laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they understand\neverything.  And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its little\nhand, plays.  When its father comes up, the child tears itself away from the\nbosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs, as though it were\nfearfully funny, and falls to sucking again.  Or it will bite its mother’s\nbreast when its little teeth are coming, while it looks sideways at her with\nits little eyes as though to say, ’Look, I am biting!’ Is not all that happiness\nwhen they are the three together, husband, wife and child?  One can\nforgive a great deal for the sake of such moments.  Yes, Liza, one must first\nlearn to live oneself before one blames others!”",
        "“It’s by pictures, pictures like that one must get at you,” I thought to\nmyself, though I did speak with real feeling, and all at once I flushed\ncrimson.  “What if she were suddenly to burst out laughing, what should I\ndo then?” That idea drove me to fury.  Towards the end of my speech I\nreally was excited, and now my vanity was somehow wounded.  The\nsilence continued.  I almost nudged her.",
        "“Why are you—” she began and stopped.  But I understood: there\nwas a quiver of something different in her voice, not abrupt, harsh and\nunyielding as before, but something soft and shamefaced, so shamefaced\nthat I suddenly felt ashamed and guilty.",
        "“What?” I asked, with tender curiosity.",
        "“Why, you ...”",
        "“What?”",
        "“Why, you ... speak somehow like a book,” she said, and again there\nwas a note of irony in her voice.",
        "That remark sent a pang to my heart.  It was not what I was expecting.",
        "I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony,\nthat this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people\nwhen the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and\nthat their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment\nand shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you.  I ought\nto have guessed the truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly\napproached her sarcasm, only bringing herself to utter it at last\nwith an effort.  But I did not guess, and an evil feeling took possession\nof me.",
        "“Wait a bit!” I thought.",
        "\n\"Oh, hush, Liza!  How can you talk about being like a book, when it\nmakes even me, an outsider, feel sick?  Though I don’t look at it as an\noutsider, for, indeed, it touches me to the heart ....  Is it possible, is it\npossible that you do not feel sick at being here yourself?  Evidently habit\ndoes wonders!  God knows what habit can do with anyone.  Can you\nseriously think that you will never grow old, that you will always be good-\nlooking, and that they will keep you here for ever and ever?  I say nothing\nof the loathsomeness of the life here .... Though let me tell you this\nabout it—about your present life, I mean; here though you are young\nnow, attractive, nice, with soul and feeling, yet you know as soon as I\ncame to myself just now I felt at once sick at being here with you!  One\ncan only come here when one is drunk.  But if you were anywhere else,\nliving as good people live, I should perhaps be more than attracted by\nyou, should fall in love with you, should be glad of a look from you, let\nalone a word; I should hang about your door, should go down on my\nknees to you, should look upon you as my betrothed and think it an\nhonour to be allowed to.  I should not dare to have an impure thought\nabout you.  But here, you see, I know that I have only to whistle and you\nhave to come with me whether you like it or not.  I don’t consult your\nwishes, but you mine.  The lowest labourer hires himself as a workman,\nbut he doesn’t make a slave of himself altogether; besides, he knows that\nhe will be free again presently.  But when are you free?  Only think what\nyou are giving up here?  What is it you are making a slave of?  It is your\nsoul, together with your body; you are selling your soul which you have\nno right to dispose of!  You give your love to be outraged by every\ndrunkard!  Love!  But that’s everything, you know, it’s a priceless diamond,\nit’s a maiden’s treasure, love—why, a man would be ready to give his\nsoul, to face death to gain that love.  But how much is your love worth\nnow?  You are sold, all of you, body and soul, and there is no need to strive\nfor love when you can have everything without love.  And you know there\nis no greater insult to a girl than that, do you understand?  To be sure, I\nhave heard that they comfort you, poor fools, they let you have lovers of\nyour own here.  But you know that’s simply a farce, that’s simply a sham,\nit’s just laughing at you, and you are taken in by it!  Why, do you suppose\nhe really loves you, that lover of yours?  I don’t believe it.  How can he\nlove you when he knows you may be called away from him any minute?\nHe would be a low fellow if he did!  Will he have a grain of respect for\nyou?  What have you in common with him?  He laughs at you and robs\nyou—that is all his love amounts to!  You are lucky if he does not beat\nyou.  Very likely he does beat you, too.  Ask him, if you have got one,\nwhether he will marry you.  He will laugh in your face, if he doesn’t spit\nin it or give you a blow—though maybe he is not worth a bad halfpenny\nhimself.  And for what have you ruined your life, if you come to think of\nit?  For the coffee they give you to drink and the plentiful meals?  But with\nwhat object are they feeding you up?  An honest girl couldn’t swallow the\nfood, for she would know what she was being fed for.  You are in debt here,\nand, of course, you will always be in debt, and you will go on in debt to\nthe end, till the visitors here begin to scorn you.  And that will soon\nhappen, don’t rely upon your youth—all that flies by express train here,\nyou know.  You will be kicked out.  And not simply kicked out; long before\nthat she’ll begin nagging at you, scolding you, abusing you, as though\nyou had not sacrificed your health for her, had not thrown away your\nyouth and your soul for her benefit, but as though you had ruined her,\nbeggared her, robbed her.  And don’t expect anyone to take your part: the\nothers, your companions, will attack you, too, win her favour, for all are\nin slavery here, and have lost all conscience and pity here long ago.  They\nhave become utterly vile, and nothing on earth is viler, more loathsome,\nand more insulting than their abuse.  And you are laying down everything\nhere, unconditionally, youth and health and beauty and hope, and at\ntwenty-two you will look like a woman of five-and-thirty, and you will be\nlucky if you are not diseased, pray to God for that!  No doubt you are\nthinking now that you have a gay time and no work to do!  Yet there is no\nwork harder or more dreadful in the world or ever has been.  One would\nthink that the heart alone would be worn out with tears.  And you won’t\ndare to say a word, not half a word when they drive you away from here;\nyou will go away as though you were to blame.  You will change to\nanother house, then to a third, then somewhere else, till you come down\nat last to the Haymarket.  There you will be beaten at every turn; that is\ngood manners there, the visitors don’t know how to be friendly without\nbeating you.  You don’t believe that it is so hateful there?  Go and look for\nyourself some time, you can see with your own eyes.  Once, one New\nYear’s Day, I saw a woman at a door.  They had turned her out as a joke, to\ngive her a taste of the frost because she had been crying so much, and\nthey shut the door behind her.  At nine o’clock in the morning she was\nalready quite drunk, dishevelled, half-naked, covered with bruises, her\nface was powdered, but she had a black-eye, blood was trickling from her\nnose and her teeth; some cabman had just given her a drubbing.  She was\nsitting on the stone steps, a salt fish of some sort was in her hand; she was\ncrying, wailing something about her luck and beating with the fish on the\nsteps, and cabmen and drunken soldiers were crowding in the doorway\ntaunting her.  You don’t believe that you will ever be like  that?  I should be\nsorry to believe it, too, but how do you know; maybe ten years, eight\nyears ago that very woman with the salt fish came here fresh as a cherub,\ninnocent, pure, knowing no evil, blushing at every word.  Perhaps she\nwas like you, proud, ready to take offence, not like the others; perhaps she\nlooked like a queen, and knew what happiness was in store for the man\nwho should love her and whom she should love.  Do you see how it\nended?  And what if at that very minute when she was beating on the filthy\nsteps with that fish, drunken and dishevelled—what if at that very\nminute she recalled the pure early days in her father’s house, when she\nused to go to school and the neighbour’s son watched for her on the way,\ndeclaring that he would love her as long as he lived, that he would devote\nhis life to her, and when they vowed to love one another for ever and be\nmarried as soon as they were grown up!  No, Liza, it would be happy for\nyou if you were to die soon of consumption in some corner, in some\ncellar like that woman just now.  In the hospital, do you say?  You will be\nlucky if they take you, but what if you are still of use to the madam here?\nConsumption is a queer disease, it is not like fever.  The patient goes on\nhoping till the last minute and says he is all right.  He deludes himself\nAnd that just suits your madam.  Don’t doubt it, that’s how it is; you have\nsold your soul, and what is more you owe money, so you daren’t say a\nword.  But when you are dying, all will abandon you, all will turn away\nfrom you, for then there will be nothing to get from you.  What’s more,\nthey will reproach you for cumbering the place, for being so long over\ndying.  However you beg you won’t get a drink of water without abuse:\n’Whenever are you going off, you nasty hussy, you won’t let us sleep with\nyour moaning, you make the gentlemen sick.’  That’s true, I have heard\nsuch things said myself.  They will thrust you dying into the filthiest\ncorner in the cellar—in the damp and darkness; what will your thoughts\nbe, lying there alone?  When you die, strange hands will lay you out, with\ngrumbling and impatience; no one will bless you, no one will sigh for\nyou, they only want to get rid of you as soon as may be; they will buy a\ncoffin, take you to the grave as they did that poor woman today, and\ncelebrate your memory at the tavern.  In the grave, sleet, filth, wet snow—\nno need to put themselves out for you—’Let her down, Vanuha; it’s just\nlike her luck—even here, she is head-foremost, the hussy.  Shorten the\ncord, you rascal.’  ’It’s all right as it is.’  ’All right, is it?  Why, she’s\non her side!  She was a fellow-creature, after all!  But, never mind, throw the\nearth on her.’  And they won’t care to waste much time quarrelling over\nyou.  They will scatter the wet blue clay as quick as they can and go off to\nthe tavern ... and there your memory on earth will end; other women\nhave children to go to their graves, fathers, husbands.  While for you\nneither tear, nor sigh, nor remembrance; no one in the whole world will\never come to you, your name will vanish from the face of the earth—as\nthough you had never existed, never been born at all!  Nothing but filth\nand mud, however you knock at your coffin lid at night, when the dead\narise, however you cry: ’Let me out, kind people, to live in the light of\nday!  My life was no life at all; my life has been thrown away like a dish-\nclout; it was drunk away in the tavern at the Haymarket; let me out, kind\npeople, to live in the world again.’”",
        "And I worked myself up to such a pitch that I began to have a lump in\nmy throat myself, and ... and all at once I stopped, sat up in dismay and,\nbending over apprehensively, began to listen with a beating heart.  I had\nreason to be troubled.",
        "I had felt for some time that I was turning her soul upside down and\nrending her heart, and—and the more I was convinced of it, the more\neagerly I desired to gain my object as quickly and as effectually as\npossible.  It was the exercise of my skill that carried me away; yet it was not\nmerely sport ....",
        "I knew I was speaking stiffly, artificially, even bookishly, in fact, I\ncould not speak except “like a book.”  But that did not trouble me: I\nknew, I felt that I should be understood and that this very bookishness\nmight be an assistance.  But now, having attained my effect, I was\nsuddenly panic-stricken.  Never before had I witnessed such despair!  She\nwas lying on her face, thrusting her face into the pillow and clutching it\nin both hands.  Her heart was being torn.  Her youthful body was\nshuddering all over as though in convulsions.  Suppressed sobs rent her\nbosom and suddenly burst out in weeping and wailing, then she pressed\ncloser into the pillow: she did not want anyone here, not a living soul, to\nknow of her anguish and her tears.  She bit the pillow, bit her hand till it\nbled (I saw that afterwards), or, thrusting her fingers into her dishevelled\nhair, seemed rigid with the effort of restraint, holding her breath and\nclenching her teeth.  I began saying something, begging her to calm\nherself, but felt that I did not dare; and all at once, in a sort of cold\nshiver, almost in terror, began fumbling in the dark, trying hurriedly to\nget dressed to go.  It was dark; though I tried my best I could not finish\ndressing quickly.  Suddenly I felt a box of matches and a candlestick with\na whole candle in it.  As soon as the room was lighted up, Liza sprang\nup, sat up in bed, and with a contorted face, with a half insane smile,\nlooked at me almost senselessly.  I sat down beside her and took her\nhands; she came to herself, made an impulsive movement towards me,\nwould have caught hold of me, but did not dare, and slowly bowed her\nhead before me. ",
        "“Liza, my dear, I was wrong ... forgive me, my dear,” I began, but\nshe squeezed my hand in her fingers so tightly that I felt I was saying the\nwrong thing and stopped.",
        "“This is my address, Liza, come to me.”",
        "“I will come,” she answered resolutely, her head still bowed.",
        "“But now I am going, good-bye ... till we meet again.”",
        "I got up; she, too, stood up and suddenly flushed all over, gave a\nshudder, snatched up a shawl that was lying on a chair and muffled\nherself in it to her chin.  As she did this she gave another sickly smile,\nblushed and looked at me strangely.  I felt wretched; I was in haste to get\naway—to disappear.",
        "“Wait a minute,” she said suddenly, in the passage just at the doorway,\nstopping me with her hand on my overcoat.  She put down the candle in\nhot haste and ran off; evidently she had thought of something or wanted\nto show me something.  As she ran away she flushed, her eyes shone, and\nthere was a smile on her lips—what was the meaning of it?  Against my\nwill I waited: she came back a minute later with an expression that\nseemed to ask forgiveness for something.  In fact, it was not the same face,\nnot the same look as the evening before: sullen, mistrustful and obstinate.\nHer eyes now were imploring, soft, and at the same time trustful,\ncaressing, timid.  The expression with which children look at people they\nare very fond of, of whom they are asking a favour.  Her eyes were a light\nhazel, they were lovely eyes, full of life, and capable of expressing love as\nwell as sullen hatred.",
        "Making no explanation, as though I, as a sort of higher being, must\nunderstand everything without explanations, she held out a piece of\npaper to me.  Her whole face was positively beaming at that instant with\nnaive, almost childish, triumph.  I unfolded it.  It was a letter to her from\na medical student or someone of that sort—a very high-flown and\nflowery, but extremely respectful, love-letter.  I don’t recall the words\nnow, but I remember well that through the high-flown phrases there was\napparent a genuine feeling, which cannot be feigned.  When I had\nfinished reading it I met her glowing, questioning, and childishly\nimpatient eyes fixed upon me.  She fastened her eyes upon my face and\nwaited impatiently for what I should say.  In a few words, hurriedly,\nbut with a sort of joy and pride, she explained to me that she had been\nto a dance somewhere in a private house, a family of “very nice people,\nWHO KNEW NOTHING, absolutely nothing, for she had only come here\nso lately and it had all happened ... and she hadn’t made up her\nmind to stay and was certainly going away as soon as she had paid her\ndebt...”  and at that party there had been the student who had danced\nwith her all the evening.  He had talked to her, and it turned out that he\nhad known her in old days at Riga when he was a child, they had played\ntogether, but a very long time ago—and he knew her parents, but ABOUT THIS\nhe knew nothing, nothing whatever, and had no suspicion!  And the\nday after the dance (three days ago) he had sent her that letter through\nthe friend with whom she had gone to the party ... and ... well, that\nwas all.”",
        "She dropped her shining eyes with a sort of bashfulness as she finished.",
        "The poor girl was keeping that student’s letter as a precious treasure,\nand had run to fetch it, her only treasure, because she did not want me to\ngo away without knowing that she, too, was honestly and genuinely loved;\nthat she, too, was addressed respectfully.  No doubt that letter was destined\nto lie in her box and lead to nothing.  But none the less, I am certain\nthat she would keep it all her life as a precious treasure, as her pride and\njustification, and now at such a minute she had thought of that letter and\nbrought it with naive pride to raise herself in my eyes that I might see,\nthat I, too, might think well of her.  I said nothing, pressed her hand and\nwent out.  I so longed to get away ... I walked all the way home, in spite\nof the fact that the melting snow was still falling in heavy flakes.  I was\nexhausted, shattered, in bewilderment.  But behind the bewilderment the\ntruth was already gleaming.  The loathsome truth.",
        "\nIt was some time, however, before I consented to recognise that truth. \nWaking up in the morning after some hours of heavy, leaden sleep, and\nimmediately realising all that had happened on the previous day, I was\npositively amazed at my last night’s SENTIMENTALITY with Liza, at all those\n\"outcries of horror and pity.”  “To think of having such an attack of\nwomanish hysteria, pah!” I concluded.  And what did I thrust my address\nupon her for?  What if she comes?  Let her come, though; it doesn’t\nmatter ....  But OBVIOUSLY, that was not now the chief and the most\nimportant matter: I had to make haste and at all costs save my reputation\nin the eyes of Zverkov and Simonov as quickly as possible; that was the\nchief business.  And I was so taken up that morning that I actually forgot\nall about Liza.",
        "First of all I had at once to repay what I had borrowed the day before\nfrom Simonov.  I resolved on a desperate measure: to borrow fifteen\nroubles straight off from Anton Antonitch.  As luck would have it he was\nin the best of humours that morning, and gave it to me at once, on the\nfirst asking.  I was so delighted at this that, as I signed the IOU with a\nswaggering air, I told him casually that the night before “I had been\nkeeping it up with some friends at the Hotel de Paris; we were giving a\nfarewell party to a comrade, in fact, I might say a friend of my childhood,\nand you know—a desperate rake, fearfully spoilt—of course, he belongs\nto a good family, and has considerable means, a brilliant career; he is\nwitty, charming, a regular Lovelace, you understand; we drank an extra\n’half-dozen’ and ...”",
        "And it went off all right; all this was uttered very easily,\nunconstrainedly and complacently.",
        "On reaching home I promptly wrote to Simonov.",
        "To this hour I am lost in admiration when I recall the truly gentlemanly,\ngood-humoured, candid tone of my letter.  With tact and good-\nbreeding, and, above all, entirely without superfluous words, I blamed\nmyself for all that had happened.  I defended myself, “if I really may be\nallowed to defend myself,” by alleging that being utterly unaccustomed\nto wine, I had been intoxicated with the first glass, which I said, I had\ndrunk before they arrived, while I was waiting for them at the Hotel de\nParis between five and six o’clock.  I begged Simonov’s pardon especially;\nI asked him to convey my explanations to all the others, especially to\nZverkov, whom “I seemed to remember as though in a dream” I had\ninsulted.  I added that I would have called upon all of them myself, but\nmy head ached, and besides I had not the face to.  I was particularly\npleased with a certain lightness, almost carelessness (strictly within the\nbounds of politeness, however), which was apparent in my style, and\nbetter than any possible arguments, gave them at once to understand that\nI took rather an independent view of “all that unpleasantness last night\";\nthat I was by no means so utterly crushed as you, my friends, probably\nimagine; but on the contrary, looked upon it as a gentleman serenely\nrespecting himself should look upon it.  “On a young hero’s past no\ncensure is cast!”",
        "“There is actually an aristocratic playfulness about it!” I thought\nadmiringly, as I read over the letter.  “And it’s all because I am an\nintellectual and cultivated man!  Another man in my place would not have\nknown how to extricate himself, but here I have got out of it and am as\njolly as ever again, and all because I am ’a cultivated and educated man\nof our day.’ And, indeed, perhaps, everything was due to the wine\nyesterday.  H’m!” ...  No, it was not the wine.  I did not drink anything at\nall between five and six when I was waiting for them.  I had lied to\nSimonov; I had lied shamelessly; and indeed I wasn’t ashamed now ....\nHang it all though, the great thing was that I was rid of it.",
        "I put six roubles in the letter, sealed it up, and asked Apollon to take it\nto Simonov.  When he learned that there was money in the letter, Apollon\nbecame more respectful and agreed to take it.  Towards evening I went out\nfor a walk.  My head was still aching and giddy after yesterday.  But as\nevening came on and the twilight grew denser, my impressions and,\nfollowing them, my thoughts, grew more and more different and confused.\nSomething was not dead within me, in the depths of my heart and\nconscience it would not die, and it showed itself in acute depression.  For\nthe most part I jostled my way through the most crowded business streets,\nalong Myeshtchansky Street, along Sadovy Street and in Yusupov Garden.\nI always liked particularly sauntering along these streets in the dusk,\njust when there were crowds of working people of all sorts going home\nfrom their daily work, with faces looking cross with anxiety.  What I liked\nwas just that cheap bustle, that bare prose.  On this occasion the jostling\nof the streets irritated me more than ever, I could not make out what was\nwrong with me, I could not find the clue, something seemed rising up\ncontinually in my soul, painfully, and refusing to be appeased.  I returned\nhome completely upset, it was just as though some crime were lying on\nmy conscience.",
        "The thought that Liza was coming worried me continually.  It seemed\nqueer to me that of all my recollections of yesterday this tormented me, as\nit were, especially, as it were, quite separately.  Everything else I had quite\nsucceeded in forgetting by the evening; I dismissed it all and was still\nperfectly satisfied with my letter to Simonov.  But on this point I was not\nsatisfied at all.  It was as though I were worried only by Liza.  “What if she\ncomes,” I thought incessantly, “well, it doesn’t matter, let her come!\nH’m! it’s horrid that she should see, for instance, how I live.  Yesterday I\nseemed such a hero to her, while now, h’m!  It’s horrid, though, that I have\nlet myself go so, the room looks like a beggar’s.  And I brought myself to go\nout to dinner in such a suit!  And my American leather sofa with the\nstuffing sticking out.  And my dressing-gown, which will not cover me,\nsuch tatters, and she will see all this and she will see Apollon.  That beast\nis certain to insult her.  He will fasten upon her in order to be rude to me. \nAnd I, of course, shall be panic-stricken as usual, I shall begin bowing\nand scraping before her and pulling my dressing-gown round me, I shall\nbegin smiling, telling lies.  Oh, the beastliness!  And it isn’t the\nbeastliness of it that matters most!  There is something more important, more\nloathsome, viler!  Yes, viler!  And to put on that dishonest lying mask\nagain! ...”",
        "When I reached that thought I fired up all at once.",
        "“Why dishonest?  How dishonest?  I was speaking sincerely last night.  I\nremember there was real feeling in me, too.  What I wanted was to excite\nan honourable feeling in her ....  Her crying was a good thing, it will\nhave a good effect.”",
        "Yet I could not feel at ease.  All that evening, even when I had come\nback home, even after nine o’clock, when I calculated that Liza could\nnot possibly come, still she haunted me, and what was worse, she came\nback to my mind always in the same position.  One moment out of all that\nhad happened last night stood vividly before my imagination; the moment\nwhen I struck a match and saw her pale, distorted face, with its look\nof torture.  And what a pitiful, what an unnatural, what a distorted smile\nshe had at that moment!  But I did not know then, that fifteen years later I\nshould still in my imagination see Liza, always with the pitiful, distorted,\ninappropriate smile which was on her face at that minute.",
        "Next day I was ready again to look upon it all as nonsense, due to over-\nexcited nerves, and, above all, as EXAGGERATED.  I was always conscious of\nthat weak point of mine, and sometimes very much afraid of it.  “I\nexaggerate everything, that is where I go wrong,” I repeated to myself\nevery hour.  But, however, “Liza will very likely come all the same,” was\nthe refrain with which all my reflections ended.  I was so uneasy that I\nsometimes flew into a fury: “She’ll come, she is certain to come!” I cried,\nrunning about the room, “if not today, she will come tomorrow; she’ll\nfind me out!  The damnable romanticism of these pure hearts!  Oh, the\nvileness—oh, the silliness—oh, the stupidity of these ’wretched sentimental\nsouls!’ Why, how fail to understand?  How could one fail to\nunderstand?  ...”",
        "But at this point I stopped short, and in great confusion, indeed.",
        "And how few, how few words, I thought, in passing, were needed; how\nlittle of the idyllic (and affectedly, bookishly, artificially idyllic too) had\nsufficed to turn a whole human life at once according to my will.  That’s\nvirginity, to be sure!  Freshness of soil!",
        "At times a thought occurred to me, to go to her, “to tell her all,” and\nbeg her not to come to me.  But this thought stirred such wrath in me that\nI believed I should have crushed that “damned” Liza if she had chanced\nto be near me at the time.  I should have insulted her, have spat at her,\nhave turned her out, have struck her!",
        "One day passed, however, another and another; she did not come and I\nbegan to grow calmer.  I felt particularly bold and cheerful after nine\no’clock, I even sometimes began dreaming, and rather sweetly: I, for\ninstance, became the salvation of Liza, simply through her coming to me\nand my talking to her .... I develop her, educate her.  Finally, I notice\nthat she loves me, loves me passionately.  I pretend not to understand (I\ndon’t know, however, why I pretend, just for effect, perhaps).  At last all\nconfusion, transfigured, trembling and sobbing, she flings herself at my\nfeet and says that I am her saviour, and that she loves me better than\nanything in the world.  I am amazed, but ....  “Liza,” I say, “can you\nimagine that I have not noticed your love?  I saw it all, I divined it, but I\ndid not dare to approach you first, because I had an influence over you and was\nafraid that you would force yourself, from gratitude, to respond to my\nlove, would try to rouse in your heart a feeling which was perhaps absent,\nand I did not wish that ... because it would be tyranny ... it would be\nindelicate (in short, I launch off at that point into European, inexplicably\nlofty subtleties a la George Sand), but now, now you are mine, you are my\ncreation, you are pure, you are good, you are my noble wife.",
        "     ’Into my house come bold and free,\n     Its rightful mistress there to be’.”",
        "Then we begin living together, go abroad and so on, and so on.  In fact,\nin the end it seemed vulgar to me myself, and I began putting out my\ntongue at myself.",
        "Besides, they won’t let her out, “the hussy!” I thought.  They don’t let\nthem go out very readily, especially in the evening (for some reason I\nfancied she would come in the evening, and at seven o’clock precisely). \nThough she did say she was not altogether a slave there yet, and had\ncertain rights; so, h’m!  Damn it all, she will come, she is sure to come!",
        "It was a good thing, in fact, that Apollon distracted my attention at that\ntime by his rudeness.  He drove me beyond all patience!  He was the bane\nof my life, the curse laid upon me by Providence.  We had been squabbling\ncontinually for years, and I hated him.  My God, how I hated him!\nI believe I had never hated anyone in my life as I hated him, especially at\nsome moments.  He was an elderly, dignified man, who worked part of his\ntime as a tailor.  But for some unknown reason he despised me beyond all\nmeasure, and looked down upon me insufferably.  Though, indeed, he\nlooked down upon everyone.  Simply to glance at that flaxen, smoothly\nbrushed head, at the tuft of hair he combed up on his forehead and oiled\nwith sunflower oil, at that dignified mouth, compressed into the shape of\nthe letter V, made one feel one was confronting a man who never doubted\nof himself.  He was a pedant, to the most extreme point, the greatest\npedant I had met on earth, and with that had a vanity only befitting\nAlexander of Macedon.  He was in love with every button on his coat,\nevery nail on his fingers—absolutely in love with them, and he looked it!\nIn his behaviour to me he was a perfect tyrant, he spoke very little to me,\nand if he chanced to glance at me he gave me a firm, majestically self-\nconfident and invariably ironical look that drove me sometimes to fury. \nHe did his work with the air of doing me the greatest favour, though he did\nscarcely anything for me, and did not, indeed, consider himself bound to\ndo anything.  There could be no doubt that he looked upon me as the\ngreatest fool on earth, and that “he did not get rid of me” was simply that he\ncould get wages from me every month.  He consented to do nothing for me\nfor seven roubles a month.  Many sins should be forgiven me for what I\nsuffered from him.  My hatred reached such a point that sometimes his\nvery step almost threw me into convulsions.  What I loathed particularly\nwas his lisp.  His tongue must have been a little too long or something of\nthat sort, for he continually lisped, and seemed to be very proud of it,\nimagining that it greatly added to his dignity.  He spoke in a slow, measured\ntone, with his hands behind his back and his eyes fixed on the ground.  He\nmaddened me particularly when he read aloud the psalms to himself\nbehind his partition.  Many a battle I waged over that reading!  But he was\nawfully fond of reading aloud in the evenings, in a slow, even, sing-song\nvoice, as though over the dead.  It is interesting that that is how he has\nended: he hires himself out to read the psalms over the dead, and at the\nsame time he kills rats and makes blacking.  But at that time I could not get\nrid of him, it was as though he were chemically combined with my\nexistence.  Besides, nothing would have induced him to consent to leave\nme. I could not live in furnished lodgings: my lodging was my private\nsolitude, my shell, my cave, in which I concealed myself from all mankind,\nand Apollon seemed to me, for some reason, an integral part of that\nflat, and for seven years I could not turn him away.",
        "To be two or three days behind with his wages, for instance, was\nimpossible.  He would have made such a fuss, I should not have known\nwhere to hide my head.  But I was so exasperated with everyone during\nthose days, that I made up my mind for some reason and with some\nobject to PUNISH Apollon and not to pay him for a fortnight the wages that\nwere owing him.  I had for a long time—for the last two years—been\nintending to do this, simply in order to teach him not to give himself airs\nwith me, and to show him that if I liked I could withhold his wages.  I\npurposed to say nothing to him about it, and was purposely silent indeed,\nin order to score off his pride and force him to be the first to speak of his\nwages.  Then I would take the seven roubles out of a drawer, show him I\nhave the money put aside on purpose, but that I won’t, I won’t, I simply\nwon’t pay him his wages, I won’t just because that is “what I wish,\"\nbecause “I am master, and it is for me to decide,” because he has been\ndisrespectful, because he has been rude; but if he were to ask respectfully\nI might be softened and give it to him, otherwise he might wait another\nfortnight, another three weeks, a whole month ....",
        "But angry as I was, yet he got the better of me.  I could not hold out for\nfour days.  He began as he always did begin in such cases, for there had\nbeen such cases already, there had been attempts (and it may be observed\nI knew all this beforehand, I knew his nasty tactics by heart).  He would\nbegin by fixing upon me an exceedingly severe stare, keeping it up for\nseveral minutes at a time, particularly on meeting me or seeing me out of\nthe house.  If I held out and pretended not to notice these stares, he\nwould, still in silence, proceed to further tortures.  All at once, A PROPOS of\nnothing, he would walk softly and smoothly into my room, when I was\npacing up and down or reading, stand at the door, one hand behind his\nback and one foot behind the other, and fix upon me a stare more than\nsevere, utterly contemptuous.  If I suddenly asked him what he wanted,\nhe would make me no answer, but continue staring at me persistently for\nsome seconds, then, with a peculiar compression of his lips and a most\nsignificant air, deliberately turn round and deliberately go back to his\nroom.  Two hours later he would come out again and again present\nhimself before me in the same way.  It had happened that in my fury I did\nnot even ask him what he wanted, but simply raised my head sharply and\nimperiously and began staring back at him.  So we stared at one another\nfor two minutes; at last he turned with deliberation and dignity and went\nback again for two hours.",
        "If I were still not brought to reason by all this, but persisted in my\nrevolt, he would suddenly begin sighing while he looked at me, long,\ndeep sighs as though measuring by them the depths of my moral degradation,\nand, of course, it ended at last by his triumphing completely: I\nraged and shouted, but still was forced to do what he wanted.",
        "This time the usual staring manoeuvres had scarcely begun when I lost\nmy temper and flew at him in a fury.  I was irritated beyond endurance\napart from him.",
        "“Stay,” I cried, in a frenzy, as he was slowly and silently turning, with\none hand behind his back, to go to his room.  “Stay!  Come back, come\nback, I tell you!” and I must have bawled so unnaturally, that he turned\nround and even looked at me with some wonder.  However, he persisted in\nsaying nothing, and that infuriated me.",
        "“How dare you come and look at me like that without being sent for?\nAnswer!”",
        "After looking at me calmly for half a minute, he began turning\nround again.",
        "“Stay!” I roared, running up to him, “don’t stir!  There.  Answer, now:\nwhat did you come in to look at?”",
        "“If you have any order to give me it’s my duty to carry it out,” he\nanswered, after another silent pause, with a slow, measured lisp, raising\nhis eyebrows and calmly twisting his head from one side to another, all\nthis with exasperating composure.",
        "“That’s not what I am asking you about, you torturer!” I shouted,\nturning crimson with anger.  “I’ll tell you why you came here myself: you\nsee, I don’t give you your wages, you are so proud you don’t want to bow\ndown and ask for it, and so you come to punish me with your stupid\nstares, to worry me and you have no sus-pic-ion how stupid it is—\nstupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! ...”",
        "He would have turned round again without a word, but I seized him.",
        "“Listen,” I shouted to him.  “Here’s the money, do you see, here it is,” (I\ntook it out of the table drawer); “here’s the seven roubles complete, but\nyou are not going to have it, you ... are ... not ... going ... to ...\nhave it until you come respectfully with bowed head to beg my pardon. \nDo you hear?”",
        "“That cannot be,” he answered, with the most unnatural self-confidence.",
        "“It shall be so,” I said, “I give you my word of honour, it shall be!”",
        "“And there’s nothing for me to beg your pardon for,” he went on, as\nthough he had not noticed my exclamations at all.  “Why, besides, you\ncalled me a ’torturer,’ for which I can summon you at the police-station\nat any time for insulting behaviour.”",
        "“Go, summon me,” I roared, “go at once, this very minute, this very\nsecond!  You are a torturer all the same!  a torturer!”",
        "But he merely looked at me, then turned, and regardless of my loud\ncalls to him, he walked to his room with an even step and without\nlooking round.",
        "“If it had not been for Liza nothing of this would have happened,” I\ndecided inwardly.  Then, after waiting a minute, I went myself behind his\nscreen with a dignified and solemn air, though my heart was beating\nslowly and violently.",
        "“Apollon,” I said quietly and emphatically, though I was breathless,\n\"go at once without a minute’s delay and fetch the police-officer.”",
        "He had meanwhile settled himself at his table, put on his spectacles\nand taken up some sewing.  But, hearing my order, he burst into a guffaw.",
        "“At once, go this minute!  Go on, or else you can’t imagine what\nwill happen.”",
        "“You are certainly out of your mind,” he observed, without even\nraising his head, lisping as deliberately as ever and threading his needle. \n\"Whoever heard of a man sending for the police against himself?  And as\nfor being frightened—you are upsetting yourself about nothing, for\nnothing will come of it.”",
        "“Go!” I shrieked, clutching him by the shoulder.  I felt I should strike\nhim in a minute.",
        "But I did not notice the door from the passage softly and slowly open at\nthat instant and a figure come in, stop short, and begin staring at us in\nperplexity I glanced, nearly swooned with shame, and rushed back to my\nroom.  There, clutching at my hair with both hands, I leaned my head\nagainst the wall and stood motionless in that position.",
        "Two minutes later I heard Apollon’s deliberate footsteps.  “There is\nsome woman asking for you,” he said, looking at me with peculiar\nseverity.  Then he stood aside and let in Liza.  He would not go away, but\nstared at us sarcastically.",
        "“Go away, go away,” I commanded in desperation.  At that moment my\nclock began whirring and wheezing and struck seven.",
        "I stood before her crushed, crestfallen, revoltingly confused, and I believe\nI smiled as I did my utmost to wrap myself in the skirts of my ragged\nwadded dressing-gown—exactly as I had imagined the scene not long\nbefore in a fit of depression.  After standing over us for a couple of minutes\nApollon went away, but that did not make me more at ease.  What made it\nworse was that she, too, was overwhelmed with confusion, more so, in\nfact, than I should have expected.  At the sight of me, of course.",
        "“Sit down,” I said mechanically, moving a chair up to the table, and I\nsat down on the sofa.  She obediently sat down at once and gazed at me\nopen-eyed, evidently expecting something from me at once.  This\nnaivete of expectation drove me to fury, but I restrained myself.",
        "She ought to have tried not to notice, as though everything had been as\nusual, while instead of that, she ... and I dimly felt that I should make\nher pay dearly for ALL THIS.",
        "“You have found me in a strange position, Liza,” I began, stammering\nand knowing that this was the wrong way to begin.  “No, no, don’t\nimagine anything,” I cried, seeing that she had suddenly flushed.  “I am\nnot ashamed of my poverty ....  On the contrary, I look with pride on my\npoverty.  I am poor but honourable ....  One can be poor and honourable,\"\nI muttered.  “However ... would you like tea? ....”",
        "“No,” she was beginning.",
        "“Wait a minute.”",
        "I leapt up and ran to Apollon.  I had to get out of the room somehow.",
        "“Apollon,” I whispered in feverish haste, flinging down before him the\nseven roubles which had remained all the time in my clenched fist, “here\nare your wages, you see I give them to you; but for that you must come to\nmy rescue: bring me tea and a dozen rusks from the restaurant.  If you\nwon’t go, you’ll make me a miserable man!  You don’t know what this\nwoman is .... This is—everything!  You may be imagining something ....\nBut you don’t know what that woman is! ...”",
        "Apollon, who had already sat down to his work and put on his\nspectacles again, at first glanced askance at the money without speaking\nor putting down his needle; then, without paying the slightest attention to\nme or making any answer, he went on busying himself with his needle,\nwhich he had not yet threaded.  I waited before him for three minutes\nwith my arms crossed A LA NAPOLEON.  My temples were moist with sweat. \nI was pale, I felt it.  But, thank God, he must have been moved to pity,\nlooking at me.  Having threaded his needle he deliberately got up from\nhis seat, deliberately moved back his chair, deliberately took off his\nspectacles, deliberately counted the money, and finally asking me over\nhis shoulder: “Shall I get a whole portion?” deliberately walked out of the\nroom.  As I was going back to Liza, the thought occurred to me on the\nway: shouldn’t I run away just as I was in my dressing-gown, no matter\nwhere, and then let happen what would?",
        "I sat down again.  She looked at me uneasily.  For some minutes we \nwere silent.",
        "“I will kill him,” I shouted suddenly, striking the table with my fist so\nthat the ink spurted out of the inkstand.",
        "“What are you saying!” she cried, starting.",
        "“I will kill him!  kill him!” I shrieked, suddenly striking the table in\nabsolute frenzy, and at the same time fully understanding how stupid it\nwas to be in such a frenzy.  “You don’t know, Liza, what that torturer is to\nme. He is my torturer ....  He has gone now to fetch some rusks; he ...”",
        "And suddenly I burst into tears.  It was an hysterical attack.  How\nashamed I felt in the midst of my sobs; but still I could not restrain them.",
        "She was frightened.",
        "“What is the matter?  What is wrong?” she cried, fussing about me.",
        "“Water, give me water, over there!” I muttered in a faint voice, though\nI was inwardly conscious that I could have got on very well without water\nand without muttering in a faint voice.  But I was, what is called, PUTTING\nIT ON, to save appearances, though the attack was a genuine one.",
        "She gave me water, looking at me in bewilderment.  At that moment\nApollon brought in the tea.  It suddenly seemed to me that this commonplace,\nprosaic tea was horribly undignified and paltry after all that had\nhappened, and I blushed crimson.  Liza looked at Apollon with positive\nalarm.  He went out without a glance at either of us.",
        "“Liza, do you despise me?” I asked, looking at her fixedly, trembling\nwith impatience to know what she was thinking.",
        "She was confused, and did not know what to answer.",
        "“Drink your tea,” I said to her angrily.  I was angry with myself, but, of\ncourse, it was she who would have to pay for it.  A horrible spite against\nher suddenly surged up in my heart; I believe I could have killed her.  To\nrevenge myself on her I swore inwardly not to say a word to her all the\ntime.  “She is the cause of it all,” I thought.",
        "Our silence lasted for five minutes.  The tea stood on the table; we did\nnot touch it.  I had got to the point of purposely refraining from beginning\nin order to embarrass her further; it was awkward for her to begin\nalone.  Several times she glanced at me with mournful perplexity.  I was\nobstinately silent.  I was, of course, myself the chief sufferer, because I\nwas fully conscious of the disgusting meanness of my spiteful stupidity,\nand yet at the same time I could not restrain myself.",
        "“I want to... get away ... from there altogether,” she began, to break\nthe silence in some way, but, poor girl, that was just what she ought not to\nhave spoken about at such a stupid moment to a man so stupid as I was. \nMy heart positively ached with pity for her tactless and unnecessary\nstraightforwardness.  But something hideous at once stifled all compassion\nin me; it even provoked me to greater venom.  I did not care what\nhappened.  Another five minutes passed.",
        "“Perhaps I am in your way,” she began timidly, hardly audibly, and was\ngetting up.",
        "But as soon as I saw this first impulse of wounded dignity I positively\ntrembled with spite, and at once burst out.",
        "“Why have you come to me, tell me that, please?” I began, gasping for\nbreath and regardless of logical connection in my words.  I longed to have\nit all out at once, at one burst; I did not even trouble how to begin.  “Why\nhave you come?  Answer, answer,” I cried, hardly knowing what I was\ndoing.  “I’ll tell you, my good girl, why you have come.  You’ve come\nbecause I talked sentimental stuff to you then.  So now you are soft as\nbutter and longing for fine sentiments again.  So you may as well know\nthat I was laughing at you then.  And I am laughing at you now.  Why are\nyou shuddering?  Yes, I was laughing at you!  I had been insulted just\nbefore, at dinner, by the fellows who came that evening before me.  I\ncame to you, meaning to thrash one of them, an officer; but I didn’t\nsucceed, I didn’t find him; I had to avenge the insult on someone to get\nback my own again; you turned up, I vented my spleen on you and\nlaughed at you.  I had been humiliated, so I wanted to humiliate; I had\nbeen treated like a rag, so I wanted to show my power ....  That’s what it\nwas, and you imagined I had come there on purpose to save you.  Yes?  You\nimagined that?  You imagined that?”",
        "I knew that she would perhaps be muddled and not take it all in exactly,\nbut I knew, too, that she would grasp the gist of it, very well indeed.  And\nso, indeed, she did.  She turned white as a handkerchief, tried to say\nsomething, and her lips worked painfully; but she sank on a chair as\nthough she had been felled by an axe.  And all the time afterwards she\nlistened to me with her lips parted and her eyes wide open, shuddering\nwith awful terror.  The cynicism, the cynicism of my words overwhelmed\nher ....",
        "“Save you!” I went on, jumping up from my chair and running up and\ndown the room before her.  “Save you from what?  But perhaps I am worse\nthan you myself.  Why didn’t you throw it in my teeth when I was giving\nyou that sermon: ’But what did you come here yourself for?  was it to read\nus a sermon?’  Power, power was what I wanted then, sport was what I\nwanted, I wanted to wring out your tears, your humiliation, your\nhysteria—that was what I wanted then!  Of course, I couldn’t keep it up\nthen, because I am a wretched creature, I was frightened, and, the devil\nknows why, gave you my address in my folly.  Afterwards, before I got\nhome, I was cursing and swearing at you because of that address, I hated\nyou already because of the lies I had told you.  Because I only like playing\nwith words, only dreaming, but, do you know, what I really want is that\nyou should all go to hell.  That is what I want.  I want peace; yes, I’d sell\nthe whole world for a farthing, straight off, so long as I was left in peace. \nIs the world to go to pot, or am I to go without my tea?  I say that the world\nmay go to pot for me so long as I always get my tea.  Did you know that, or\nnot?  Well, anyway, I know that I am a blackguard, a scoundrel, an egoist,\na sluggard.  Here I have been shuddering for the last three days at the\nthought of your coming.  And do you know what has worried me particularly\nfor these three days?  That I posed as such a hero to you, and now\nyou would see me in a wretched torn dressing-gown, beggarly, loathsome.\nI told you just now that I was not ashamed of my poverty; so you\nmay as well know that I am ashamed of it; I am more ashamed of it than\nof anything, more afraid of it than of being found out if I were a thief,\nbecause I am as vain as though I had been skinned and the very air\nblowing on me hurt.  Surely by now you must realise that I shall never\nforgive you for having found me in this wretched dressing-gown, just as I\nwas flying at Apollon like a spiteful cur.  The saviour, the former hero, was\nflying like a mangy, unkempt sheep-dog at his lackey, and the lackey was\njeering at him!  And I shall never forgive you for the tears I could not help\nshedding before you just now, like some silly woman put to shame!  And\nfor what I am confessing to you now, I shall never forgive you either!\nYes—you must answer for it all because you turned up like this, because I\nam a blackguard, because I am the nastiest, stupidest, absurdest and most\nenvious of all the worms on earth, who are not a bit better than I am, but,\nthe devil knows why, are never put to confusion; while I shall always be\ninsulted by every louse, that is my doom!  And what is it to me that you\ndon’t understand a word of this!  And what do I care, what do I care about\nyou, and whether you go to ruin there or not?  Do you understand?  How I\nshall hate you now after saying this, for having been here and listening. \nWhy, it’s not once in a lifetime a man speaks out like this, and then it is in\nhysterics!  ...  What more do you want?  Why do you still stand confronting\nme, after all this?  Why are you worrying me?  Why don’t you go?”",
        "But at this point a strange thing happened.  I was so accustomed to think\nand imagine everything from books, and to picture everything in the\nworld to myself just as I had made it up in my dreams beforehand, that I\ncould not all at once take in this strange circumstance.  What happened\nwas this: Liza, insulted and crushed by me, understood a great deal more\nthan I imagined.  She understood from all this what a woman understands\nfirst of all, if she feels genuine love, that is, that I was myself unhappy.",
        "The frightened and wounded expression on her face was followed first\nby a look of sorrowful perplexity.  When I began calling myself a scoundrel\nand a blackguard and my tears flowed (the tirade was accompanied\nthroughout by tears) her whole face worked convulsively.  She was on the\npoint of getting up and stopping me; when I finished she took no notice of\nmy shouting: “Why are you here, why don’t you go away?” but realised\nonly that it must have been very bitter to me to say all this.  Besides, she\nwas so crushed, poor girl; she considered herself infinitely beneath me;\nhow could she feel anger or resentment?  She suddenly leapt up from her\nchair with an irresistible impulse and held out her hands, yearning\ntowards me, though still timid and not daring to stir ....  At this point\nthere was a revulsion in my heart too.  Then she suddenly rushed to me,\nthrew her arms round me and burst into tears.  I, too, could not restrain\nmyself, and sobbed as I never had before.",
        "“They won’t let me ... I can’t be good!” I managed to articulate; then\nI went to the sofa, fell on it face downwards, and sobbed on it for a quarter\nof an hour in genuine hysterics.  She came close to me, put her arms\nround me and stayed motionless in that position.  But the trouble was that\nthe hysterics could not go on for ever, and (I am writing the loathsome\ntruth) lying face downwards on the sofa with my face thrust into my nasty\nleather pillow, I began by degrees to be aware of a far-away, involuntary\nbut irresistible feeling that it would be awkward now for me to raise my\nhead and look Liza straight in the face.  Why was I ashamed?  I don’t\nknow, but I was ashamed.  The thought, too, came into my overwrought\nbrain that our parts now were completely changed, that she was now the\nheroine, while I was just a crushed and humiliated creature as she had\nbeen before me that night—four days before ....  And all this came into\nmy mind during the minutes I was lying on my face on the sofa.",
        "My God!  surely I was not envious of her then.",
        "I don’t know, to this day I cannot decide, and at the time, of course, I\nwas still less able to understand what I was feeling than now.  I cannot get\non without domineering and tyrannising over someone, but ... there is\nno explaining anything by reasoning and so it is useless to reason.",
        "I conquered myself, however, and raised my head; I had to do so\nsooner or later ... and I am convinced to this day that it was just because\nI was ashamed to look at her that another feeling was suddenly kindled\nand flamed up in my heart ... a feeling of mastery and possession.  My\neyes gleamed with passion, and I gripped her hands tightly.  How I hated\nher and how I was drawn to her at that minute!  The one feeling intensified\nthe other.  It was almost like an act of vengeance.  At first there was a\nlook of amazement, even of terror on her face, but only for one instant. \nShe warmly and rapturously embraced me.",
        "\nA quarter of an hour later I was rushing up and down the room in\nfrenzied impatience, from minute to minute I went up to the screen and\npeeped through the crack at Liza.  She was sitting on the ground with her\nhead leaning against the bed, and must have been crying.  But she did not\ngo away, and that irritated me.  This time she understood it all.  I had\ninsulted her finally, but ... there’s no need to describe it.  She realised\nthat my outburst of passion had been simply revenge, a fresh humiliation,\nand that to my earlier, almost causeless hatred was added now a\nPERSONAL HATRED, born of envy ....  Though I do not maintain positively\nthat she understood all this distinctly; but she certainly did fully understand\nthat I was a despicable man, and what was worse, incapable of\nloving her.\nI know I shall be told that this is incredible—but it is incredible to be\nas spiteful and stupid as I was; it may be added that it was strange I should\nnot love her, or at any rate, appreciate her love.  Why is it strange?  In the\nfirst place, by then I was incapable of love, for I repeat, with me loving\nmeant tyrannising and showing my moral superiority.  I have never in my\nlife been able to imagine any other sort of love, and have nowadays come\nto the point of sometimes thinking that love really consists in the right—\nfreely given by the beloved object—to tyrannise over her.",
        "Even in my underground dreams I did not imagine love except as a\nstruggle.  I began it always with hatred and ended it with moral subjugation,\nand afterwards I never knew what to do with the subjugated object. \nAnd what is there to wonder at in that, since I had succeeded in so\ncorrupting myself, since I was so out of touch with “real life,” as to have\nactually thought of reproaching her, and putting her to shame for having\ncome to me to hear “fine sentiments\"; and did not even guess that she had\ncome not to hear fine sentiments, but to love me, because to a woman all\nreformation, all salvation from any sort of ruin, and all moral renewal is\nincluded in love and can only show itself in that form.",
        "I did not hate her so much, however, when I was running about the\nroom and peeping through the crack in the screen.  I was only insufferably\noppressed by her being here.  I wanted her to disappear.  I wanted\n\"peace,” to be left alone in my underground world.  Real life oppressed\nme with its novelty so much that I could hardly breathe.",
        "But several minutes passed and she still remained, without stirring, as\nthough she were unconscious.  I had the shamelessness to tap softly at the\nscreen as though to remind her ....  She started, sprang up, and flew to\nseek her kerchief, her hat, her coat, as though making her escape from\nme ....  Two minutes later she came from behind the screen and looked\nwith heavy eyes at me.  I gave a spiteful grin, which was forced, however,\nto KEEP UP APPEARANCES, and I turned away from her eyes.",
        "“Good-bye,” she said, going towards the door.",
        "I ran up to her, seized her hand, opened it, thrust something in it and\nclosed it again.  Then I turned at once and dashed away in haste to the\nother corner of the room to avoid seeing, anyway ....",
        "I did mean a moment since to tell a lie—to write that I did this\naccidentally, not knowing what I was doing through foolishness, through\nlosing my head.  But I don’t want to lie, and so I will say straight out that I\nopened her hand and put the money in it ... from spite.  It came into my\nhead to do this while I was running up and down the room and she was\nsitting behind the screen.  But this I can say for certain: though I did that\ncruel thing purposely, it was not an impulse from the heart, but came\nfrom my evil brain.  This cruelty was so affected, so purposely made up,\nso completely a product of the brain, of books, that I could not even keep\nit up a minute—first I dashed away to avoid seeing her, and then in\nshame and despair rushed after Liza.  I opened the door in the passage and\nbegan listening.",
        "“Liza!  Liza!” I cried on the stairs, but in a low voice, not boldly.\nThere was no answer, but I fancied I heard her footsteps, lower down\non the stairs.",
        "“Liza!” I cried, more loudly.",
        "No answer.  But at that minute I heard the stiff outer glass door open\nheavily with a creak and slam violently; the sound echoed up the stairs.",
        "She had gone.  I went back to my room in hesitation.  I felt horribly\noppressed.",
        "I stood still at the table, beside the chair on which she had sat and\nlooked aimlessly before me.  A minute passed, suddenly I started; straight\nbefore me on the table I saw ....  In short, I saw a crumpled blue five-\nrouble note, the one I had thrust into her hand a minute before.  It was the\nsame note; it could be no other, there was no other in the flat.  So she had\nmanaged to fling it from her hand on the table at the moment when I had\ndashed into the further corner.",
        "Well!  I might have expected that she would do that.  Might I have\nexpected it?  No, I was such an egoist, I was so lacking in respect for my\nfellow-creatures that I could not even imagine she would do so.  I could\nnot endure it.  A minute later I flew like a madman to dress, flinging on\nwhat I could at random and ran headlong after her.  She could not have\ngot two hundred paces away when I ran out into the street.",
        "It was a still night and the snow was coming down in masses and falling\nalmost perpendicularly, covering the pavement and the empty street as\nthough with a pillow.  There was no one in the street, no sound was to be\nheard.  The street lamps gave a disconsolate and useless glimmer.  I ran\ntwo hundred paces to the cross-roads and stopped short.",
        "Where had she gone?  And why was I running after her?",
        "Why?  To fall down before her, to sob with remorse, to kiss her feet, to\nentreat her forgiveness!  I longed for that, my whole breast was being rent\nto pieces, and never, never shall I recall that minute with indifference. \nBut—what for?  I thought.  Should I not begin to hate her, perhaps, even\ntomorrow, just because I had kissed her feet today?  Should I give her\nhappiness?  Had I not recognised that day, for the hundredth time, what I\nwas worth?  Should I not torture her?",
        "I stood in the snow, gazing into the troubled darkness and pondered this.",
        "“And will it not be better?” I mused fantastically, afterwards at home,\nstifling the living pang of my heart with fantastic dreams.  “Will it not\nbe better that she should keep the resentment of the insult for ever?\nResentment—why, it is purification; it is a most stinging and painful\nconsciousness!  Tomorrow I should have defiled her soul and have exhausted\nher heart, while now the feeling of insult will never die in her heart,\nand however loathsome the filth awaiting her—the feeling of insult will\nelevate and purify her ... by hatred ... h’m! ... perhaps, too, by\nforgiveness ....  Will all that make things easier for her though? ...”",
        "And, indeed, I will ask on my own account here, an idle question:\nwhich is better—cheap happiness or exalted sufferings?  Well, which is better?",
        "So I dreamed as I sat at home that evening, almost dead with the pain\nin my soul.  Never had I endured such suffering and remorse, yet could\nthere have been the faintest doubt when I ran out from my lodging that I\nshould turn back half-way?  I never met Liza again and I have heard\nnothing of her.  I will add, too, that I remained for a long time afterwards\npleased with the phrase about the benefit from resentment and hatred in\nspite of the fact that I almost fell ill from misery.",
        "Even now, so many years later, all this is somehow a very evil memory. \nI have many evil memories now, but ... hadn’t I better end my “Notes\"\nhere?  I believe I made a mistake in beginning to write them, anyway I\nhave felt ashamed all the time I’ve been writing this story; so it’s hardly\nliterature so much as a corrective punishment.  Why, to tell long stories,\nshowing how I have spoiled my life through morally rotting in my corner,\nthrough lack of fitting environment, through divorce from real life, and\nrankling spite in my underground world, would certainly not be interesting;\na novel needs a hero, and all the traits for an anti-hero are EXPRESSLY\ngathered together here, and what matters most, it all produces an unpleasant\nimpression, for we are all divorced from life, we are all cripples,\nevery one of us, more or less.  We are so divorced from it that we feel at\nonce a sort of loathing for real life, and so cannot bear to be reminded of\nit. Why, we have come almost to looking upon real life as an effort,\nalmost as hard work, and we are all privately agreed that it is better in\nbooks.  And why do we fuss and fume sometimes?  Why are we perverse\nand ask for something else?  We don’t know what ourselves.  It would be\nthe worse for us if our petulant prayers were answered.  Come, try, give\nany one of us, for instance, a little more independence, untie our hands,\nwiden the spheres of our activity, relax the control and we ... yes, I\nassure you ... we should be begging to be under control again at once.  I\nknow that you will very likely be angry with me for that, and will begin\nshouting and stamping.  Speak for yourself, you will say, and for your\nmiseries in your underground holes, and don’t dare to say all of us—\nexcuse me, gentlemen, I am not justifying myself with that “all of us.”  As\nfor what concerns me in particular I have only in my life carried to an\nextreme what you have not dared to carry halfway, and what’s more, you\nhave taken your cowardice for good sense, and have found comfort in\ndeceiving yourselves.  So that perhaps, after all, there is more life in me\nthan in you.  Look into it more carefully!  Why, we don’t even know what\nliving means now, what it is, and what it is called?  Leave us alone without\nbooks and we shall be lost and in confusion at once.  We shall not know\nwhat to join on to, what to cling to, what to love and what to hate, what\nto respect and what to despise.  We are oppressed at being men—men\nwith a real individual body and blood, we are ashamed of it, we think it a\ndisgrace and try to contrive to be some sort of impossible generalised\nman.  We are stillborn, and for generations past have been begotten, not\nby living fathers, and that suits us better and better.  We are developing a\ntaste for it.  Soon we shall contrive to be born somehow from an idea.  But\nenough; I don’t want to write more from “Underground.”",
