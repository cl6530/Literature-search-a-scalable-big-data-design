        "I fear that my ambassador and I shall not continue much longer\ntogether. He is really growing past endurance. He transacts\nhis business in so ridiculous a manner, that I am often compelled\nto contradict him, and do things my own way; and then, of course,\nhe thinks them very ill done. He complained of me lately on this\naccount at court; and the minister gave me a reprimand, — a\ngentle one it is true, but still a reprimand. In consequence of\nthis, I was about to tender my resignation, when I received a\nletter, to which I submitted with great respect, on account of the\nhigh, noble, and generous spirit which dictated it. He endeavoured\nto soothe my excessive sensibility, paid a tribute to my extreme\nideas of duty, of good example, and of perseverance in business,\nas the fruit of my youthful ardour, an impulse which he did not\nseek to destroy, but only to moderate, that it might have proper\nplay and be productive of good. So now I am at rest for another\nweek, and no longer at variance with myself. Content and peace\nof mind are valuable things: I could wish, my dear friend, that\nthese precious jewels were less transitory. ",
