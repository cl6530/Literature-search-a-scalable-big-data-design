        "Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\nfive daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\nfrom her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\nThey attacked him in various ways–with barefaced questions,\ningenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\nskill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the\nsecond-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.  Her\nreport was highly favourable.  Sir William had been delighted\nwith him.  He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\nagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next\nassembly with a large party.  Nothing could be more delightful!\nTo be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\nand very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.",
        "“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\nNetherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the\nothers equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”",
        "In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat\nabout ten minutes with him in his library.  He had entertained\nhopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of\nwhose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.\nThe ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the\nadvantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore\na blue coat, and rode a black horse.",
        "An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\nalready had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\ncredit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which\ndeferred it all.  Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the\nfollowing day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour\nof their invitation, etc.  Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.\nShe could not imagine what business he could have in town so\nsoon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear\nthat he might be always flying about from one place to another,\nand never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.  Lady Lucas\nquieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone\nto London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report\nsoon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly.  The girls grieved\nover such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day\nbefore the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought\nonly six with him from London–his five sisters and a cousin.\nAnd when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of\nonly five altogether–Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband\nof the eldest, and another young man.",
        "Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners.  His sisters were fine\nwomen, with an air of decided fashion.  His brother-in-law, Mr.\nHurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon\ndrew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome\nfeatures, noble mien, and the report which was in general\ncirculation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having\nten thousand a year.  The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine\nfigure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than\nMr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about\nhalf the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned\nthe tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud;\nto be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be\ncompared with his friend.",
        "Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\nprincipal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\ndanced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early,\nand talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.  Such amiable\nqualities must speak for themselves.  What a contrast between\nhim and his friend!  Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst\nand once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any\nother lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about\nthe room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.  His\ncharacter was decided.  He was the proudest, most disagreeable\nman in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come\nthere again.  Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs.\nBennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened\ninto particular resentment by his having slighted one of her\ndaughters.",
        "Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,\nto sit down for two dances; and during part of that time,\nMr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a\nconversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the\ndance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.",
        "“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance.  I hate to see\nyou standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.  You had\nmuch better dance.”",
        "“I certainly shall not.  You know how I detest it, unless I am\nparticularly acquainted with my partner.  At such an assembly as\nthis it would be insupportable.  Your sisters are engaged, and\nthere is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\npunishment to me to stand up with.”",
        "“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley,\n“for a kingdom!  Upon my honour, I never met with so many\npleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are\nseveral of them you see uncommonly pretty.”",
        "“_You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\"\nsaid Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.",
        "“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!  But\nthere is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is\nvery pretty, and I dare say very agreeable.  Do let me ask my\npartner to introduce you.”",
        "“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a\nmoment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own\nand coldly said: “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to\ntempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence\nto young ladies who are slighted by other men.  You had better\nreturn to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting\nyour time with me.”",
        "Mr. Bingley followed his advice.  Mr. Darcy walked off; and\nElizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.\nShe told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends;\nfor she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in\nanything ridiculous.",
        "The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole\nfamily.  Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much\nadmired by the Netherfield party.  Mr. Bingley had danced with\nher twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.  Jane\nwas as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in\na quieter way.  Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure.  Mary had heard\nherself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished\ngirl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\nfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all\nthat they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.  They returned,\ntherefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they\nlived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.  They\nfound Mr. Bennet still up.  With a book he was regardless of\ntime; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of\ncuriosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such\nsplendid expectations.  He had rather hoped that his wife’s\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon\nfound out that he had a different story to hear.",
        "“Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have\nhad a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.  I wish you\nhad been there.  Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\nEverybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought\nher quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!  Only think of\nthat, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was\nthe only creature in the room that he asked a second time.\nFirst of all, he asked Miss Lucas.  I was so vexed to see him\nstand up with her!  But, however, he did not admire her at all;\nindeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with\nJane as she was going down the dance.  So he inquired who she\nwas, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.  Then\nthe two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with\nMaria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two\nsixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger–”",
        "“If he had had any compassion for me,” cried her husband\nimpatiently, “he would not have danced half so much!  For God’s\nsake, say no more of his partners.  O that he had sprained\nhis ankle in the first place!”",
        "“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him.  He is so\nexcessively handsome!  And his sisters are charming women.\nI never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.\nI dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown–”",
        "Here she was interrupted again.  Mr. Bennet protested against\nany description of finery.  She was therefore obliged to seek\nanother branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness\nof spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr.\nDarcy.",
        "“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose\nmuch by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable,\nhorrid man, not at all worth pleasing.  So high and so conceited\nthat there was no enduring him!  He walked here, and he walked\nthere, fancying himself so very great!  Not handsome enough to\ndance with!  I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given\nhim one of your set-downs.  I quite detest the man.”",
