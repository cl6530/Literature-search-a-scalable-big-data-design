        "To Alfred Nutt",
        "Last year, in giving the young ones a volume of English Fairy Tales,\nmy difficulty was one of collection. This time, in offering them\nspecimens of the rich folk-fancy of the Celts of these islands, my\ntrouble has rather been one of selection. Ireland began to collect\nher folk-tales almost as early as any country in Europe, and Croker\nhas found a whole school of successors in Carleton, Griffin,\nKennedy, Curtin, and Douglas Hyde. Scotland had the great name of\nCampbell, and has still efficient followers in MacDougall, MacInnes,\nCarmichael, Macleod, and Campbell of Tiree. Gallant little Wales has\nno name to rank alongside these; in this department the Cymru have\nshown less vigour than the Gaedhel. Perhaps the Eisteddfod, by\noffering prizes for the collection of Welsh folk-tales, may remove\nthis inferiority. Meanwhile Wales must be content to be somewhat\nscantily represented among the Fairy Tales of the Celts, while the\nextinct Cornish tongue has only contributed one tale.",
        "In making my selection I have chiefly tried to make the stories\ncharacteristic. It would have been easy, especially from Kennedy, to\nhave made up a volume entirely filled with “Grimm’s Goblins” à la\nCeltique. But one can have too much even of that very good\nthing, and I have therefore avoided as far as possible the more\nfamiliar “formulae” of folk-tale literature. To do this I had to\nwithdraw from the English-speaking Pale both in Scotland and\nIreland, and I laid down the rule to include only tales that have\nbeen taken down from Celtic peasants ignorant of English.",
        "Having laid down the rule, I immediately proceeded to break it. The\nsuccess of a fairy book, I am convinced, depends on the due\nadmixture of the comic and the romantic: Grimm and Asbjörnsen knew\nthis secret, and they alone. But the Celtic peasant who speaks\nGaelic takes the pleasure of telling tales somewhat sadly: so far as\nhe has been printed and translated, I found him, to my surprise,\nconspicuously lacking in humour. For the comic relief of this volume\nI have therefore had to turn mainly to the Irish peasant of the\nPale; and what richer source could I draw from?",
        "For the more romantic tales I have depended on the Gaelic, and, as I\nknow about as much of Gaelic as an Irish Nationalist M. P., I have\nhad to depend on translators. But I have felt myself more at liberty\nthan the translators themselves, who have generally been over-\nliteral, in changing, excising, or modifying the original. I have\neven gone further. In order that the tales should be characteristically\nCeltic, I have paid more particular attention to tales that are to be\nfound on both sides of the North Channel.",
        "In re-telling them I have had no scruple in interpolating now and\nthen a Scotch incident into an Irish variant of the same story, or\nvice versa. Where the translators appealed to English folklorists\nand scholars, I am trying to attract English children. They translated; I\nendeavoured to transfer. In short, I have tried to put myself into the\nposition of an ollamh or sheenachie familiar with both forms\nof Gaelic, and anxious to put his stories in the best way to attract\nEnglish children. I trust I shall be forgiven by Celtic scholars for the\nchanges I have had to make to effect this end.",
        "The stories collected in this volume are longer and more detailed\nthan the English ones I brought together last Christmas. The\nromantic ones are certainly more romantic, and the comic ones\nperhaps more comic, though there may be room for a difference of\nopinion on this latter point. This superiority of the Celtic folk-\ntales is due as much to the conditions under which they have been\ncollected, as to any innate superiority of the folk-imagination. The\nfolk-tale in England is in the last stages of exhaustion. The Celtic\nfolk-tales have been collected while the practice of story-telling\nis still in full vigour, though there are every signs that its term\nof life is already numbered. The more the reason why they should be\ncollected and put on record while there is yet time. On the whole,\nthe industry of the collectors of Celtic folk-lore is to be\ncommended, as may be seen from the survey of it I have prefixed to\nthe Notes and References at the end of the volume. Among these, I\nwould call attention to the study of the legend of Beth Gellert, the\norigin of which, I believe, I have settled.",
        "While I have endeavoured to render the language of the tales simple\nand free from bookish artifice, I have not felt at liberty to retell\nthe tales in the English way. I have not scrupled to retain a Celtic\nturn of speech, and here and there a Celtic word, which I have\nnot explained within brackets–a practice to be abhorred of\nall good men. A few words unknown to the reader only add\neffectiveness and local colour to a narrative, as Mr. Kipling well\nknows.",
        "One characteristic of the Celtic folk-lore I have endeavoured to\nrepresent in my selection, because it is nearly unique at the\npresent day in Europe. Nowhere else is there so large and consistent\na body of oral tradition about the national and mythical heroes as\namongst the Gaels. Only the byline, or hero-songs of Russia,\nequal in extent the amount of knowledge about the heroes of the past\nthat still exists among the Gaelic-speaking peasantry of Scotland\nand Ireland. And the Irish tales and ballads have this peculiarity,\nthat some of them have been extant, and can be traced, for well nigh\na thousand years. I have selected as a specimen of this class the\nStory of Deirdre, collected among the Scotch peasantry a few years\nago, into which I have been able to insert a passage taken from an\nIrish vellum of the twelfth century. I could have more than filled\nthis volume with similar oral traditions about Finn (the Fingal of\nMacpherson’s “Ossian”). But the story of Finn, as told by the Gaelic\npeasantry of to-day, deserves a volume by itself, while the\nadventures of the Ultonian hero, Cuchulain, could easily fill\nanother.",
        "I have endeavoured to include in this volume the best and most\ntypical stories told by the chief masters of the Celtic folk-tale,\nCampbell, Kennedy, Hyde, and Curtin, and to these I have added the\nbest tales scattered elsewhere. By this means I hope I have put\ntogether a volume, containing both the best, and the best known\nfolk-tales of the Celts. I have only been enabled to do this by the\ncourtesy of those who owned the copyright of these stories. Lady\nWilde has kindly granted me the use of her effective version of “The\nHorned Women;” and I have specially to thank Messrs. Macmillan for\nright to use Kennedy’s “Legendary Fictions,” and Messrs. Sampson Low\n& Co., for the use of Mr. Curtin’s Tales.",
        "In making my selection, and in all doubtful points of treatment, I\nhave had resource to the wide knowledge of my friend Mr. Alfred Nutt\nin all branches of Celtic folk-lore. If this volume does anything to\nrepresent to English children the vision and colour, the magic and\ncharm, of the Celtic folk-imagination, this is due in large measure\nto the care with which Mr. Nutt has watched its inception and\nprogress. With him by my side I could venture into regions where the\nnon-Celt wanders at his own risk.",
        "Lastly, I have again to rejoice in the co-operation of my friend,\nMr. J. D. Batten, in giving form to the creations of the folk-fancy.\nHe has endeavoured in his illustrations to retain as much as\npossible of Celtic ornamentation; for all details of Celtic\narchaeology he has authority. Yet both he and I have striven to give\nCeltic things as they appear to, and attract, the English mind,\nrather than attempt the hopeless task of representing them as they\nare to Celts. The fate of the Celt in the British Empire bids fair\nto resemble that of the Greeks among the Romans. “They went forth to\nbattle, but they always fell,” yet the captive Celt has enslaved his\ncaptor in the realm of imagination. The present volume attempts to\nbegin the pleasant captivity from the earliest years. If it could\nsucceed in giving a common fund of imaginative wealth to the Celtic\nand the Saxon children of these isles, it might do more for a true\nunion of hearts than all your politics.",

        "Connla of the Fiery Hair was son of Conn of the Hundred Fights. One\nday as he stood by the side of his father on the height of Usna, he\nsaw a maiden clad in strange attire coming towards him.",
        "“Whence comest thou, maiden?” said Connla.",
        "“I come from the Plains of the Ever Living,” she said, “there where\nthere is neither death nor sin. There we keep holiday alway, nor\nneed we help from any in our joy. And in all our pleasure we have no\nstrife. And because we have our homes in the round green hills, men\ncall us the Hill Folk.”",
        "The king and all with him wondered much to hear a voice when they\nsaw no one. For save Connla alone, none saw the Fairy Maiden.",
        "“To whom art thou talking, my son?” said Conn the king.",
        "Then the maiden answered, “Connla speaks to a young, fair maid, whom\nneither death nor old age awaits. I love Connla, and now I call him\naway to the Plain of Pleasure, Moy Mell, where Boadag is king for\naye, nor has there been complaint or sorrow in that land since he\nhas held the kingship. Oh, come with me, Connla of the Fiery Hair,\nruddy as the dawn with thy tawny skin. A fairy crown awaits thee to\ngrace thy comely face and royal form. Come, and never shall thy\ncomeliness fade, nor thy youth, till the last awful day of\njudgment.”",
        "The king in fear at what the maiden said, which he heard though he\ncould not see her, called aloud to his Druid, Coran by name.",
        "“Oh, Coran of the many spells,” he said, “and of the cunning magic,\nI call upon thy aid. A task is upon me too great for all my skill\nand wit, greater than any laid upon me since I seized the kingship.\nA maiden unseen has met us, and by her power would take from me my\ndear, my comely son. If thou help not, he will be taken from thy\nking by woman’s wiles and witchery.”",
        "Then Coran the Druid stood forth and chanted his spells towards the\nspot where the maiden’s voice had been heard. And none heard her\nvoice again, nor could Connla see her longer. Only as she vanished\nbefore the Druid’s mighty spell, she threw an apple to Connla.",
        "For a whole month from that day Connla would take nothing, either to\neat or to drink, save only from that apple. But as he ate it grew\nagain and always kept whole. And all the while there grew within him\na mighty yearning and longing after the maiden he had seen.",
        "But when the last day of the month of waiting came, Connla stood by\nthe side of the king his father on the Plain of Arcomin, and again\nhe saw the maiden come towards him, and again she spoke to him.",
        "“’Tis a glorious place, forsooth, that Connla holds among short-\nlived mortals awaiting the day of death. But now the folk of life,\nthe ever-living ones, beg and bid thee come to Moy Mell, the Plain\nof Pleasure, for they have learnt to know thee, seeing thee in thy\nhome among thy dear ones.”",
        "When Conn the king heard the maiden’s voice he called to his men\naloud and said:",
        "“Summon swift my Druid Coran, for I see she has again this day the\npower of speech.”",
        "Then the maiden said: “Oh, mighty Conn, fighter of a hundred fights,\nthe Druid’s power is little loved; it has little honour in the\nmighty land, peopled with so many of the upright. When the Law will\ncome, it will do away with the Druid’s magic spells that come from\nthe lips of the false black demon.”",
        "Then Conn the king observed that since the maiden came, Connla his\nson spoke to none that spake to him. So Conn of the hundred fights\nsaid to him, “Is it to thy mind what the woman says, my son?”",
        "“’Tis hard upon me,” then said Connla; “I love my own folk above all\nthings; but yet, but yet a longing seizes me for the maiden.”",
        "When the maiden heard this, she answered and said “The ocean is not\nso strong as the waves of thy longing. Come with me in my curragh,\nthe gleaming, straight-gliding crystal canoe. Soon we can reach\nBoadag’s realm. I see the bright sun sink, yet far as it is, we can\nreach it before dark. There is, too, another land worthy of thy\njourney, a land joyous to all that seek it. Only wives and maidens\ndwell there. If thou wilt, we can seek it and live there alone\ntogether in joy.”",
        "When the maiden ceased to speak, Connla of the Fiery Hair rushed\naway from them and sprang into the curragh, the gleaming, straight-\ngliding crystal canoe. And then they all, king and court, saw it\nglide away over the bright sea towards the setting sun. Away and\naway, till eye could see it no longer, and Connla and the Fairy\nMaiden went their way on the sea, and were no more seen, nor did any\nknow where they came.",
        "There was once a boy in the County Mayo; Guleesh was his name. There\nwas the finest rath a little way off from the gable of the house,\nand he was often in the habit of seating himself on the fine grass\nbank that was running round it. One night he stood, half leaning\nagainst the gable of the house, and looking up into the sky, and\nwatching the beautiful white moon over his head. After he had been\nstanding that way for a couple of hours, he said to himself: “My\nbitter grief that I am not gone away out of this place altogether.\nI’d sooner be any place in the world than here. Och, it’s well for\nyou, white moon,” says he, “that’s turning round, turning round, as\nyou please yourself, and no man can put you back. I wish I was the\nsame as you.”",
        "Hardly was the word out of his mouth when he heard a great noise\ncoming like the sound of many people running together, and talking,\nand laughing, and making sport, and the sound went by him like a\nwhirl of wind, and he was listening to it going into the rath.\n\"Musha, by my soul,” says he, “but ye’re merry enough, and I’ll\nfollow ye.”",
        "What was in it but the fairy host, though he did not know at first\nthat it was they who were in it, but he followed them into the rath.\nIt’s there he heard the fulparnee, and the folpornee, the\nrap-lay-hoota, and the roolya-boolya, that they had there,\nand every man of them crying out as loud as he could: “My horse,\nand bridle, and saddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!”",
        "“By my hand,” said Guleesh, “my boy, that’s not bad. I’ll imitate\nye,” and he cried out as well as they: “My horse, and bridle, and\nsaddle! My horse, and bridle, and saddle!” And on the moment there\nwas a fine horse with a bridle of gold, and a saddle of silver,\nstanding before him. He leaped up on it, and the moment he was on\nits back he saw clearly that the rath was full of horses, and of\nlittle people going riding on them.",
        "Said a man of them to him: “Are you coming with us to-night,\nGuleesh?”",
        "“I am surely,” said Guleesh.",
        "“If you are, come along,” said the little man, and out they went all\ntogether, riding like the wind, faster than the fastest horse ever\nyou saw a-hunting, and faster than the fox and the hounds at his\ntail.",
        "The cold winter’s wind that was before them, they overtook her, and\nthe cold winter’s wind that was behind them, she did not overtake\nthem. And stop nor stay of that full race, did they make none, until\nthey came to the brink of the sea.",
        "Then every one of them said: “Hie over cap! Hie over cap!” and that\nmoment they were up in the air, and before Guleesh had time to\nremember where he was, they were down on dry land again, and were\ngoing like the wind.",
        "At last they stood still, and a man of them said to Guleesh:\n\"Guleesh, do you know where you are now?”",
        "“Not a know,” says Guleesh.",
        "“You’re in France, Guleesh,” said he. “The daughter of the king of\nFrance is to be married to-night, the handsomest woman that the sun\never saw, and we must do our best to bring her with us; if we’re\nonly able to carry her off; and you must come with us that we may be\nable to put the young girl up behind you on the horse, when we’ll be\nbringing her away, for it’s not lawful for us to put her sitting\nbehind ourselves. But you’re flesh and blood, and she can take a\ngood grip of you, so that she won’t fall off the horse. Are you\nsatisfied, Guleesh, and will you do what we’re telling you?”",
        "“Why shouldn’t I be satisfied?” said Guleesh. “I’m satisfied,\nsurely, and anything that ye will tell me to do I’ll do it without\ndoubt.”",
        "They got off their horses there, and a man of them said a word that\nGuleesh did not understand, and on the moment they were lifted up,\nand Guleesh found himself and his companions in the palace. There\nwas a great feast going on there, and there was not a nobleman or a\ngentleman in the kingdom but was gathered there, dressed in silk and\nsatin, and gold and silver, and the night was as bright as the day\nwith all the lamps and candles that were lit, and Guleesh had to\nshut his two eyes at the brightness. When he opened them again and\nlooked from him, he thought he never saw anything as fine as all he\nsaw there. There were a hundred tables spread out, and their full of\nmeat and drink on each table of them, flesh-meat, and cakes and\nsweetmeats, and wine and ale, and every drink that ever a man saw.\nThe musicians were at the two ends of the hall, and they were\nplaying the sweetest music that ever a man’s ear heard, and there\nwere young women and fine youths in the middle of the hall, dancing\nand turning, and going round so quickly and so lightly, that it put\na soorawn in Guleesh’s head to be looking at them. There were\nmore there playing tricks, and more making fun and laughing, for\nsuch a feast as there was that day had not been in France for twenty\nyears, because the old king had no children alive but only the one\ndaughter, and she was to be married to the son of another king that\nnight. Three days the feast was going on, and the third night she\nwas to be married, and that was the night that Guleesh and the\nsheehogues came, hoping, if they could, to carry off with them the\nking’s young daughter.",
        "Guleesh and his companions were standing together at the head of the\nhall, where there was a fine altar dressed up, and two bishops\nbehind it waiting to marry the girl, as soon as the right time\nshould come. Now nobody could see the sheehogues, for they said a\nword as they came in, that made them all invisible, as if they had\nnot been in it at all.",
        "“Tell me which of them is the king’s daughter,” said Guleesh, when\nhe was becoming a little used to the noise and the light.",
        "“Don’t you see her there away from you?” said the little man that he\nwas talking to.",
        "Guleesh looked where the little man was pointing with his finger,\nand there he saw the loveliest woman that was, he thought, upon the\nridge of the world. The rose and the lily were fighting together in\nher face, and one could not tell which of them got the victory. Her\narms and hands were like the lime, her mouth as red as a strawberry\nwhen it is ripe, her foot was as small and as light as another one’s\nhand, her form was smooth and slender, and her hair was falling down\nfrom her head in buckles of gold. Her garments and dress were woven\nwith gold and silver, and the bright stone that was in the ring on\nher hand was as shining as the sun.",
        "Guleesh was nearly blinded with all the loveliness and beauty that\nwas in her; but when he looked again, he saw that she was crying,\nand that there was the trace of tears in her eyes. “It can’t be,\"\nsaid Guleesh, “that there’s grief on her, when everybody round her\nis so full of sport and merriment.”",
        "“Musha, then, she is grieved,” said the little man; “for it’s\nagainst her own will she’s marrying, and she has no love for the\nhusband she is to marry. The king was going to give her to him three\nyears ago, when she was only fifteen, but she said she was too\nyoung, and requested him to leave her as she was yet. The king gave\nher a year’s grace, and when that year was up he gave her another\nyear’s grace, and then another; but a week or a day he would not\ngive her longer, and she is eighteen years old to-night, and it’s\ntime for her to marry; but, indeed,” says he, and he crooked his\nmouth in an ugly way–\"indeed, it’s no king’s son she’ll marry, if I\ncan help it.”",
        "Guleesh pitied the handsome young lady greatly when he heard that,\nand he was heart-broken to think that it would be necessary for her\nto marry a man she did not like, or, what was worse, to take a nasty\nsheehogue for a husband. However, he did not say a word, though he\ncould not help giving many a curse to the ill-luck that was laid out\nfor himself, to be helping the people that were to snatch her away\nfrom her home and from her father.",
        "He began thinking, then, what it was he ought to do to save her, but\nhe could think of nothing. “Oh! if I could only give her some help\nand relief,” said he, “I wouldn’t care whether I were alive or dead;\nbut I see nothing that I can do for her.”",
        "He was looking on when the king’s son came up to her and asked her\nfor a kiss, but she turned her head away from him. Guleesh had\ndouble pity for her then, when he saw the lad taking her by the soft\nwhite hand, and drawing her out to dance. They went round in the\ndance near where Guleesh was, and he could plainly see that there\nwere tears in her eyes.",
        "When the dancing was over, the old king, her father, and her mother\nthe queen, came up and said that this was the right time to marry\nher, that the bishop was ready, and it was time to put the wedding-\nring on her and give her to her husband.",
        "The king took the youth by the hand, and the queen took her\ndaughter, and they went up together to the altar, with the lords and\ngreat people following them.",
        "When they came near the altar, and were no more than about four\nyards from it, the little sheehogue stretched out his foot before\nthe girl, and she fell. Before she was able to rise again he threw\nsomething that was in his hand upon her, said a couple of words, and\nupon the moment the maiden was gone from amongst them. Nobody could\nsee her, for that word made her invisible. The little maneen\nseized her and raised her up behind Guleesh, and the king nor no one\nelse saw them, but out with them through the hall till they came to\nthe door.",
        "Oro! dear Mary! it’s there the pity was, and the trouble, and the\ncrying, and the wonder, and the searching, and the rookawn,\nwhen that lady disappeared from their eyes, and without their seeing\nwhat did it. Out of the door of the palace they went, without being\nstopped or hindered, for nobody saw them, and, “My horse, my bridle,\nand saddle!” says every man of them. “My horse, my bridle, and\nsaddle!” says Guleesh; and on the moment the horse was standing\nready caparisoned before him. “Now, jump up, Guleesh,” said the\nlittle man, “and put the lady behind you, and we will be going; the\nmorning is not far off from us now.”",
        "Guleesh raised her up on the horse’s back, and leaped up himself\nbefore her, and, “Rise, horse,” said he; and his horse, and the\nother horses with him, went in a full race until they came to the\nsea.",
        "“Hie over cap!” said every man of them.",
        "“Hie over cap!” said Guleesh; and on the moment the horse rose under\nhim, and cut a leap in the clouds, and came down in Erin.",
        "They did not stop there, but went of a race to the place where was\nGuleesh’s house and the rath. And when they came as far as that,\nGuleesh turned and caught the young girl in his two arms, and leaped\noff the horse.",
        "“I call and cross you to myself, in the name of God!” said he; and\non the spot, before the word was out of his mouth, the horse fell\ndown, and what was in it but the beam of a plough, of which they had\nmade a horse; and every other horse they had, it was that way they\nmade it. Some of them were riding on an old besom, and some on a\nbroken stick, and more on a bohalawn or a hemlock-stalk.",
        "The good people called out together when they heard what Guleesh\nsaid:",
        "“Oh! Guleesh, you clown, you thief, that no good may happen you, why\ndid you play that trick on us?”",
        "But they had no power at all to carry off the girl, after Guleesh\nhad consecrated her to himself.",
        "“Oh! Guleesh, isn’t that a nice turn you did us, and we so kind to\nyou? What good have we now out of our journey to France. Never mind\nyet, you clown, but you’ll pay us another time for this. Believe us,\nyou’ll repent it.”",
        "“He’ll have no good to get out of the young girl,” said the little\nman that was talking to him in the palace before that, and as he\nsaid the word he moved over to her and struck her a slap on the side\nof the head. “Now,” says he, “she’ll be without talk any more; now,\nGuleesh, what good will she be to you when she’ll be dumb? It’s time\nfor us to go–but you’ll remember us, Guleesh!”",
        "When he said that he stretched out his two hands, and before Guleesh\nwas able to give an answer, he and the rest of them were gone into\nthe rath out of his sight, and he saw them no more.",
        "He turned to the young woman and said to her: “Thanks be to God,\nthey’re gone. Would you not sooner stay with me than with them?” She\ngave him no answer. “There’s trouble and grief on her yet,” said\nGuleesh in his own mind, and he spoke to her again: “I am afraid\nthat you must spend this night in my father’s house, lady, and if\nthere is anything that I can do for you, tell me, and I’ll be your\nservant.”",
        "The beautiful girl remained silent, but there were tears in her\neyes, and her face was white and red after each other.",
        "“Lady,” said Guleesh, “tell me what you would like me to do now. I\nnever belonged at all to that lot of sheehogues who carried you away\nwith them. I am the son of an honest farmer, and I went with them\nwithout knowing it. If I’ll be able to send you back to your father\nI’ll do it, and I pray you make any use of me now that you may\nwish.”",
        "He looked into her face, and he saw the mouth moving as if she was\ngoing to speak, but there came no word from it.",
        "“It cannot be,” said Guleesh, “that you are dumb. Did I not hear you\nspeaking to the king’s son in the palace to-night? Or has that devil\nmade you really dumb, when he struck his nasty hand on your jaw?”",
        "The girl raised her white smooth hand, and laid her finger on her\ntongue, to show him that she had lost her voice and power of speech,\nand the tears ran out of her two eyes like streams, and Guleesh’s\nown eyes were not dry, for as rough as he was on the outside he had\na soft heart, and could not stand the sight of the young girl, and\nshe in that unhappy plight.",
        "He began thinking with himself what he ought to do, and he did not\nlike to bring her home with himself to his father’s house, for he\nknew well that they would not believe him, that he had been in\nFrance and brought back with him the king of France’s daughter, and\nhe was afraid they might make a mock of the young lady or insult\nher.",
        "As he was doubting what he ought to do, and hesitating, he chanced\nto remember the priest. “Glory be to God,” said he, “I know now what\nI’ll do; I’ll bring her to the priest’s house, and he won’t refuse\nme to keep the lady and care for her.” He turned to the lady again\nand told her that he was loth to take her to his father’s house, but\nthat there was an excellent priest very friendly to himself, who\nwould take good care of her, if she wished to remain in his house;\nbut that if there was any other place she would rather go, he said\nhe would bring her to it.",
        "She bent her head, to show him she was obliged, and gave him to\nunderstand that she was ready to follow him any place he was going.\n\"We will go to the priest’s house, then,” said he; “he is under an\nobligation to me, and will do anything I ask him.”",
        "They went together accordingly to the priest’s house, and the sun\nwas just rising when they came to the door. Guleesh beat it hard,\nand as early as it was the priest was up, and opened the door\nhimself. He wondered when he saw Guleesh and the girl, for he was\ncertain that it was coming wanting to be married they were.",
        "“Guleesh, Guleesh, isn’t it the nice boy you are that you can’t wait\ntill ten o’clock or till twelve, but that you must be coming to me\nat this hour, looking for marriage, you and your sweetheart? You\nought to know that I can’t marry you at such a time, or, at all\nevents, can’t marry you lawfully. But ubbubboo!” said he, suddenly,\nas he looked again at the young girl, “in the name of God, who have\nyou here? Who is she, or how did you get her?”",
        "“Father,” said Guleesh, “you can marry me, or anybody else, if you\nwish; but it’s not looking for marriage I came to you now, but to\nask you, if you please, to give a lodging in your house to this\nyoung lady.”",
        "The priest looked at him as though he had ten heads on him; but\nwithout putting any other question to him, he desired him to come\nin, himself and the maiden, and when they came in, he shut the door,\nbrought them into the parlour, and put them sitting.",
        "“Now, Guleesh,” said he, “tell me truly who is this young lady, and\nwhether you’re out of your senses really, or are only making a joke\nof me.”",
        "“I’m not telling a word of lie, nor making a joke of you,” said\nGuleesh; “but it was from the palace of the king of France I carried\noff this lady, and she is the daughter of the king of France.”",
        "He began his story then, and told the whole to the priest, and the\npriest was so much surprised that he could not help calling out at\ntimes, or clapping his hands together.",
        "When Guleesh said from what he saw he thought the girl was not\nsatisfied with the marriage that was going to take place in the\npalace before he and the sheehogues broke it up, there came a red\nblush into the girl’s cheek, and he was more certain than ever that\nshe had sooner be as she was–badly as she was–than be the married\nwife of the man she hated. When Guleesh said that he would be very\nthankful to the priest if he would keep her in his own house, the\nkind man said he would do that as long as Guleesh pleased, but that\nhe did not know what they ought to do with her, because they had no\nmeans of sending her back to her father again.",
        "Guleesh answered that he was uneasy about the same thing, and that\nhe saw nothing to do but to keep quiet until they should find some\nopportunity of doing something better. They made it up then between\nthemselves that the priest should let on that it was his brother’s\ndaughter he had, who was come on a visit to him from another county,\nand that he should tell everybody that she was dumb, and do his best\nto keep every one away from her. They told the young girl what it\nwas they intended to do, and she showed by her eyes that she was\nobliged to them.",
        "Guleesh went home then, and when his people asked him where he had\nbeen, he said that he had been asleep at the foot of the ditch, and\nhad passed the night there.",
        "There was great wonderment on the priest’s neighbours at the girl\nwho came so suddenly to his house without any one knowing where she\nwas from, or what business she had there. Some of the people said\nthat everything was not as it ought to be, and others, that Guleesh\nwas not like the same man that was in it before, and that it was a\ngreat story, how he was drawing every day to the priest’s house, and\nthat the priest had a wish and a respect for him, a thing they could\nnot clear up at all.",
        "That was true for them, indeed, for it was seldom the day went by\nbut Guleesh would go to the priest’s house, and have a talk with\nhim, and as often as he would come he used to hope to find the young\nlady well again, and with leave to speak; but, alas! she remained\ndumb and silent, without relief or cure. Since she had no other\nmeans of talking, she carried on a sort of conversation between\nherself and himself, by moving her hand and fingers, winking her\neyes, opening and shutting her mouth, laughing or smiling, and a\nthousand other signs, so that it was not long until they understood\neach other very well. Guleesh was always thinking how he should send\nher back to her father; but there was no one to go with her, and he\nhimself did not know what road to go, for he had never been out of\nhis own country before the night he brought her away with him. Nor\nhad the priest any better knowledge than he; but when Guleesh asked\nhim, he wrote three or four letters to the king of France, and gave\nthem to buyers and sellers of wares, who used to be going from place\nto place across the sea; but they all went astray, and never a one\ncame to the king’s hand.",
        "This was the way they were for many months, and Guleesh was falling\ndeeper and deeper in love with her every day, and it was plain to\nhimself and the priest that she liked him. The boy feared greatly at\nlast, lest the king should really hear where his daughter was, and\ntake her back from himself, and he besought the priest to write no\nmore, but to leave the matter to God.",
        "So they passed the time for a year, until there came a day when\nGuleesh was lying by himself, on the grass, on the last day of the\nlast month in autumn, and he was thinking over again in his own mind\nof everything that happened to him from the day that he went with\nthe sheehogues across the sea. He remembered then, suddenly, that it\nwas one November night that he was standing at the gable of the\nhouse, when the whirlwind came, and the sheehogues in it, and he\nsaid to himself: “We have November night again to-day, and I’ll\nstand in the same place I was last year, until I see if the good\npeople come again. Perhaps I might see or hear something that would\nbe useful to me, and might bring back her talk again to Mary\"–that\nwas the name himself and the priest called the king’s daughter, for\nneither of them knew her right name. He told his intention to the\npriest, and the priest gave him his blessing.",
        "Guleesh accordingly went to the old rath when the night was\ndarkening, and he stood with his bent elbow leaning on a grey old\nflag, waiting till the middle of the night should come. The moon\nrose slowly; and it was like a knob of fire behind him; and there\nwas a white fog which was raised up over the fields of grass and all\ndamp places, through the coolness of the night after a great heat in\nthe day. The night was calm as is a lake when there is not a breath\nof wind to move a wave on it, and there was no sound to be heard but\nthe cronawn of the insects that would go by from time to\ntime, or the hoarse sudden scream of the wild-geese, as they passed\nfrom lake to lake, half a mile up in the air over his head; or the\nsharp whistle of the golden and green plover, rising and lying,\nlying and rising, as they do on a calm night. There were a thousand\nthousand bright stars shining over his head, and there was a little\nfrost out, which left the grass under his foot white and crisp.",
        "He stood there for an hour, for two hours, for three hours, and the\nfrost increased greatly, so that he heard the breaking of the\ntraneens under his foot as often as he moved. He was thinking,\nin his own mind, at last, that the sheehogues would not come that\nnight, and that it was as good for him to return back again, when\nhe heard a sound far away from him, coming towards him, and he\nrecognised what it was at the first moment. The sound increased,\nand at first it was like the beating of waves on a stony shore, and\nthen it was like the falling of a great waterfall, and at last it was like\na loud storm in the tops of the trees, and then the whirlwind burst\ninto the rath of one rout, and the sheehogues were in it.",
        "It all went by him so suddenly that he lost his breath with it, but\nhe came to himself on the spot, and put an ear on himself, listening\nto what they would say.",
        "Scarcely had they gathered into the rath till they all began\nshouting, and screaming, and talking amongst themselves; and then\neach one of them cried out: “My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My\nhorse, and bridle, and saddle!” and Guleesh took courage, and called\nout as loudly as any of them: “My horse, and bridle, and saddle! My\nhorse, and bridle, and saddle!” But before the word was well out of\nhis mouth, another man cried out: “Ora! Guleesh, my boy, are you\nhere with us again? How are you getting on with your woman? There’s\nno use in your calling for your horse to-night. I’ll go bail you\nwon’t play such a trick on us again. It was a good trick you played\non us last year?”",
        "“It was,” said another man; “he won’t do it again.”",
        "“Isn’t he a prime lad, the same lad! to take a woman with him that\nnever said as much to him as, ’How do you do?’ since this time last\nyear!” says the third man.",
        "“Perhaps be likes to be looking at her,” said another voice.",
        "“And if the omadawn only knew that there’s an herb growing up\nby his own door, and if he were to boil it and give it to her, she’d\nbe well,” said another voice.",
        "“That’s true for you.”",
        "“He is an omadawn.”",
        "“Don’t bother your head with him; we’ll be going.”",
        "“We’ll leave the bodach as he is.”",
        "And with that they rose up into the air, and out with them with one\nroolya-boolya the way they came; and they left poor Guleesh\nstanding where they found him, and the two eyes going out of his\nhead, looking after them and wondering.",
        "He did not stand long till he returned back, and he thinking in his\nown mind on all he saw and heard, and wondering whether there was\nreally an herb at his own door that would bring back the talk to the\nking’s daughter. “It can’t be,” says he to himself, “that they would\ntell it to me, if there was any virtue in it; but perhaps the\nsheehogue didn’t observe himself when he let the word slip out of\nhis mouth. I’ll search well as soon as the sun rises, whether\nthere’s any plant growing beside the house except thistles and\ndockings.”",
        "He went home, and as tired as he was he did not sleep a wink until\nthe sun rose on the morrow. He got up then, and it was the first\nthing he did to go out and search well through the grass round about\nthe house, trying could he get any herb that he did not recognise.\nAnd, indeed, he was not long searching till he observed a large\nstrange herb that was growing up just by the gable of the house.",
        "He went over to it, and observed it closely, and saw that there were\nseven little branches coming out of the stalk, and seven leaves\ngrowing on every brancheen of them; and that there was a\nwhite sap in the leaves. “It’s very wonderful,” said he to himself,\n\"that I never noticed this herb before. If there’s any virtue in an\nherb at all, it ought to be in such a strange one as this.”",
        "He drew out his knife, cut the plant, and carried it into his own\nhouse; stripped the leaves off it and cut up the stalk; and there\ncame a thick, white juice out of it, as there comes out of the sow-\nthistle when it is bruised, except that the juice was more like oil.",
        "He put it in a little pot and a little water in it, and laid it on\nthe fire until the water was boiling, and then he took a cup, filled\nit half up with the juice, and put it to his own mouth. It came into\nhis head then that perhaps it was poison that was in it, and that\nthe good people were only tempting him that he might kill himself\nwith that trick, or put the girl to death without meaning it. He put\ndown the cup again, raised a couple of drops on the top of his\nfinger, and put it to his mouth. It was not bitter, and, indeed, had\na sweet, agreeable taste. He grew bolder then, and drank the full of\na thimble of it, and then as much again, and he never stopped till\nhe had half the cup drunk. He fell asleep after that, and did not\nwake till it was night, and there was great hunger and great thirst\non him.",
        "He had to wait, then, till the day rose; but he determined, as soon\nas he should wake in the morning, that he would go to the king’s\ndaughter and give her a drink of the juice of the herb.",
        "As soon as he got up in the morning, he went over to the priest’s\nhouse with the drink in his hand, and he never felt himself so bold\nand valiant, and spirited and light, as he was that day, and he was\nquite certain that it was the drink he drank which made him so\nhearty.",
        "When he came to the house, he found the priest and the young lady\nwithin, and they were wondering greatly why he had not visited them\nfor two days.",
        "He told them all his news, and said that he was certain that there\nwas great power in that herb, and that it would do the lady no hurt,\nfor he tried it himself and got good from it, and then he made her\ntaste it, for he vowed and swore that there was no harm in it.",
        "Guleesh handed her the cup, and she drank half of it, and then fell\nback on her bed and a heavy sleep came on her, and she never woke\nout of that sleep till the day on the morrow.",
        "Guleesh and the priest sat up the entire night with her, waiting\ntill she should awake, and they between hope and unhope, between\nexpectation of saving her and fear of hurting her.",
        "She awoke at last when the sun had gone half its way through the\nheavens. She rubbed her eyes and looked like a person who did not\nknow where she was. She was like one astonished when she saw Guleesh\nand the priest in the same room with her, and she sat up doing her\nbest to collect her thoughts.",
        "The two men were in great anxiety waiting to see would she speak, or\nwould she not speak, and when they remained silent for a couple of\nminutes, the priest said to her: “Did you sleep well, Mary?”",
        "And she answered him: “I slept, thank you.”",
        "No sooner did Guleesh hear her talking than he put a shout of joy\nout of him, and ran over to her and fell on his two knees, and said:\n\"A thousand thanks to God, who has given you back the talk; lady of\nmy heart, speak again to me.”",
        "The lady answered him that she understood it was he who boiled that\ndrink for her, and gave it to her; that she was obliged to him from\nher heart for all the kindness he showed her since the day she first\ncame to Ireland, and that he might be certain that she never would\nforget it.",
        "Guleesh was ready to die with satisfaction and delight. Then they\nbrought her food, and she ate with a good appetite, and was merry\nand joyous, and never left off talking with the priest while she was\neating.",
        "After that Guleesh went home to his house, and stretched himself on\nthe bed and fell asleep again, for the force of the herb was not all\nspent, and he passed another day and a night sleeping. When he woke\nup he went back to the priest’s house, and found that the young lady\nwas in the same state, and that she was asleep almost since the time\nthat he left the house.",
        "He went into her chamber with the priest, and they remained watching\nbeside her till she awoke the second time, and she had her talk as\nwell as ever, and Guleesh was greatly rejoiced. The priest put food\non the table again, and they ate together, and Guleesh used after\nthat to come to the house from day to day, and the friendship that\nwas between him and the king’s daughter increased, because she had\nno one to speak to except Guleesh and the priest, and she liked\nGuleesh best.",
        "So they married one another, and that was the fine wedding they had,\nand if I were to be there then, I would not be here now; but I heard\nit from a birdeen that there was neither cark nor care, sickness nor\nsorrow, mishap nor misfortune on them till the hour of their death,\nand may the same be with me, and with us all!",
        "One fine day in harvest–it was indeed Lady-day in harvest, that\neverybody knows to be one of the greatest holidays in the year–Tom\nFitzpatrick was taking a ramble through the ground, and went along\nthe sunny side of a hedge; when all of a sudden he heard a clacking\nsort of noise a little before him in the hedge. “Dear me,” said Tom,\n\"but isn’t it surprising to hear the stonechatters singing so late\nin the season?” So Tom stole on, going on the tops of his toes to\ntry if he could get a sight of what was making the noise, to see if\nhe was right in his guess. The noise stopped; but as Tom looked\nsharply through the bushes, what should he see in a nook of the\nhedge but a brown pitcher, that might hold about a gallon and a half\nof liquor; and by-and-by a little wee teeny tiny bit of an old man,\nwith a little motty of a cocked hat stuck upon the top of his\nhead, a deeshy daushy leather apron hanging before him, pulled out a\nlittle wooden stool, and stood up upon it, and dipped a little\npiggin into the pitcher, and took out the full of it, and put it\nbeside the stool, and then sat down under the pitcher, and began to\nwork at putting a heel-piece on a bit of a brogue just fit for\nhimself. “Well, by the powers,” said Tom to himself, “I often heard\ntell of the Lepracauns, and, to tell God’s truth, I never rightly\nbelieved in them–but here’s one of them in real earnest. If I go\nknowingly to work, I’m a made man. They say a body must never take\ntheir eyes off them, or they’ll escape.”",
        "Tom now stole on a little further, with his eye fixed on the little\nman just as a cat does with a mouse. So when he got up quite close\nto him, “God bless your work, neighbour,” said Tom.",
        "The little man raised up his head, and “Thank you kindly,” said he.",
        "“I wonder you’d be working on the holiday!” said Tom.",
        "“That’s my own business, not yours,” was the reply.",
        "“Well, may be you’d be civil enough to tell us what you’ve\ngot in the pitcher there?” said Tom.",
        "“That I will, with pleasure,” said he; “it’s good beer.”",
        "“Beer!” said Tom. “Thunder and fire! where did you get it?”",
        "“Where did I get it, is it?  Why, I made it. And what do you think I\nmade it of?”",
        "“Devil a one of me knows,” said Tom; “but of malt, I suppose, what\nelse?”",
        "“There you’re out. I made it of heath.”",
        "“Of heath!” said Tom, bursting out laughing; “sure you don’t think\nme to be such a fool as to believe that?”",
        "“Do as you please,” said he, “but what I tell you is the truth. Did\nyou never hear tell of the Danes?”",
        "“Well, what about them?” said Tom.",
        "“Why, all the about them there is, is that when they were here they\ntaught us to make beer out of the heath, and the secret’s in my\nfamily ever since.”",
        "“Will you give a body a taste of your beer?” said Tom.",
        "“I’ll tell you what it is, young man, it would be fitter for you to\nbe looking after your father’s property than to be bothering decent\nquiet people with your foolish questions. There now, while you’re\nidling away your time here, there’s the cows have broke into the\noats, and are knocking the corn all about.”",
        "Tom was taken so by surprise with this that he was just on the very\npoint of turning round when he recollected himself; so, afraid that\nthe like might happen again, he made a grab at the Lepracaun, and\ncaught him up in his hand; but in his hurry he overset the pitcher,\nand spilt all the beer, so that he could not get a taste of it to\ntell what sort it was. He then swore that he would kill him if he\ndid not show him where his money was. Tom looked so wicked and so\nbloody-minded that the little man was quite frightened; so says he,\n\"Come along with me a couple of fields off, and I’ll show you a\ncrock of gold.”",
        "So they went, and Tom held the Lepracaun fast in his hand, and never\ntook his eyes from off him, though they had to cross hedges and\nditches, and a crooked bit of bog, till at last they came to a great\nfield all full of boliauns, and the Lepracaun pointed to a big\nboliaun, and says he, “Dig under that boliaun, and you’ll get the\ngreat crock all full of guineas.”",
        "Tom in his hurry had never thought of bringing a spade with him, so\nhe made up his mind to run home and fetch one; and that he might\nknow the place again he took off one of his red garters, and tied it\nround the boliaun.",
        "Then he said to the Lepracaun, “Swear ye’ll not take that garter\naway from that boliaun.” And the Lepracaun swore right away not to\ntouch it.",
        "“I suppose,” said the Lepracaun, very civilly, “you have no further\noccasion for me?”",
        "“No,” says Tom; “you may go away now, if you please, and God speed\nyou, and may good luck attend you wherever you go.”",
        "“Well, good-bye to you, Tom Fitzpatrick,” said the Lepracaun; “and\nmuch good may it do you when you get it.”",
        "So Tom ran for dear life, till he came home and got a spade, and\nthen away with him, as hard as he could go, back to the field of\nboliauns; but when he got there, lo and behold! not a boliaun in the\nfield but had a red garter, the very model of his own, tied about\nit; and as to digging up the whole field, that was all nonsense, for\nthere were more than forty good Irish acres in it. So Tom came home\nagain with his spade on his shoulder, a little cooler than he went,\nand many’s the hearty curse he gave the Lepracaun every time he\nthought of the neat turn he had served him.",
        "A rich woman sat up late one night carding and preparing wool, while\nall the family and servants were asleep. Suddenly a knock was given\nat the door, and a voice called, “Open! open!”",
        "“Who is there?” said the woman of the house.",
        "“I am the Witch of one Horn,” was answered.",
        "The mistress, supposing that one of her neighbours had called and\nrequired assistance, opened the door, and a woman entered, having in\nher hand a pair of wool-carders, and bearing a horn on her forehead,\nas if growing there. She sat down by the fire in silence, and began\nto card the wool with violent haste. Suddenly she paused, and said\naloud: “Where are the women? they delay too long.”",
        "Then a second knock came to the door, and a voice called as before,\n\"Open! open!”",
        "The mistress felt herself obliged to rise and open to the call, and\nimmediately a second witch entered, having two horns on her\nforehead, and in her hand a wheel for spinning wool.",
        "“Give me place,” she said; “I am the Witch of the two Horns,” and\nshe began to spin as quick as lightning.",
        "And so the knocks went on, and the call was heard, and the witches\nentered, until at last twelve women sat round the fire–the first\nwith one horn, the last with twelve horns.",
        "And they carded the thread, and turned their spinning-wheels, and\nwound and wove, all singing together an ancient rhyme, but no word\ndid they speak to the mistress of the house. Strange to hear, and\nfrightful to look upon, were these twelve women, with their horns\nand their wheels; and the mistress felt near to death, and she tried\nto rise that she might call for help, but she could not move, nor\ncould she utter a word or a cry, for the spell of the witches was\nupon her.",
        "Then one of them called to her in Irish, and said, “Rise, woman, and\nmake us a cake.”",
        "Then the mistress searched for a vessel to bring water from the well\nthat she might mix the meal and make the cake, but she could find\nnone.",
        "And they said to her, “Take a sieve and bring water in it.”",
        "And she took the sieve and went to the well; but the water poured\nfrom it, and she could fetch none for the cake, and she sat down by\nthe well and wept.",
        "Then a voice came by her and said, “Take yellow clay and moss, and\nbind them together, and plaster the sieve so that it will hold.”",
        "This she did, and the sieve held the water for the cake; and the\nvoice said again:",
        "“Return, and when thou comest to the north angle of the house, cry\naloud three times and say, ’The mountain of the Fenian women and the\nsky over it is all on fire.’”",
        "And she did so.",
        "When the witches inside heard the call, a great and terrible cry\nbroke from their lips, and they rushed forth with wild lamentations\nand shrieks, and fled away to Slievenamon, where was their chief\nabode. But the Spirit of the Well bade the mistress of the house to\nenter and prepare her home against the enchantments of the witches\nif they returned again.",
        "And first, to break their spells, she sprinkled the water in which\nshe had washed her child’s feet, the feet-water, outside the door on\nthe threshold; secondly, she took the cake which in her absence the\nwitches had made of meal mixed with the blood drawn from the\nsleeping family, and she broke the cake in bits, and placed a bit in\nthe mouth of each sleeper, and they were restored; and she took the\ncloth they had woven, and placed it half in and half out of the\nchest with the padlock; and lastly, she secured the door with a\ngreat crossbeam fastened in the jambs, so that the witches could not\nenter, and having done these things she waited.",
        "Not long were the witches in coming back, and they raged and called\nfor vengeance.",
        "“Open! open!” they screamed; “open, feet-water!”",
        "“I cannot,” said the feet-water; “I am scattered on the ground, and\nmy path is down to the Lough.”",
        "“Open, open, wood and trees and beam!” they cried to the door.",
        "“I cannot,” said the door, “for the beam is fixed in the jambs and I\nhave no power to move.”",
        "“Open, open, cake that we have made and mingled with blood!” they\ncried again.",
        "“I cannot,” said the cake, “for I am broken and bruised, and my\nblood is on the lips of the sleeping children.”",
        "Then the witches rushed through the air with great cries, and fled\nback to Slievenamon, uttering strange curses on the Spirit of the\nWell, who had wished their ruin; but the woman and the house were\nleft in peace, and a mantle dropped by one of the witches in her\nflight was kept hung up by the mistress in memory of that night; and\nthis mantle was kept by the same family from generation to\ngeneration for five hundred years after.",
        "Conall Yellowclaw was a sturdy tenant in Erin: he had three sons.\nThere was at that time a king over every fifth of Erin. It fell out\nfor the children of the king that was near Conall, that they\nthemselves and the children of Conall came to blows. The children of\nConall got the upper hand, and they killed the king’s big son. The\nking sent a message for Conall, and he said to him–\"Oh, Conall!\nwhat made your sons go to spring on my sons till my big son was\nkilled by your children? but I see that though I follow you\nrevengefully, I shall not be much better for it, and I will now set\na thing before you, and if you will do it, I will not follow you\nwith revenge. If you and your sons will get me the brown horse of\nthe king of Lochlann, you shall get the souls of your sons.”",
        "“Why,” said Conall, “should not I do the pleasure of the king,\nthough there should be no souls of my sons in dread at all. Hard is\nthe matter you require of me, but I will lose my own life, and the\nlife of my sons, or else I will do the pleasure of the king.”",
        "After these words Conall left the king, and he went home: when he\ngot home he was under much trouble and perplexity. When he went to\nlie down he told his wife the thing the king had set before him. His\nwife took much sorrow that he was obliged to part from herself,\nwhile she knew not if she should see him more.",
        "“Oh, Conall,” said she, “why didst not thou let the king do his own\npleasure to thy sons, rather than be going now, while I know not if\never I shall see thee more?”",
        "When he rose on the morrow, he set himself and his three sons in\norder, and they took their journey towards Lochlann, and they made\nno stop but tore through ocean till they reached it. When they\nreached Lochlann they did not know what they should do. Said the old\nman to his sons, “Stop ye, and we will seek out the house of the\nking’s miller.”",
        "When they went into the house of the king’s miller, the man asked\nthem to stop there for the night. Conall told the miller that his\nown children and the children of his king had fallen out, and that\nhis children had killed the king’s son, and there was nothing that\nwould please the king but that he should get the brown horse of the\nking of Lochlann.",
        "“If you will do me a kindness, and will put me in a way to get him,\nfor certain I will pay ye for it.”",
        "“The thing is silly that you are come to seek,” said the miller;\n\"for the king has laid his mind on him so greatly that you will not\nget him in any way unless you steal him; but if you can make out a\nway, I will keep it secret.”",
        "“This is what I am thinking,” said Conall, “since you are working\nevery day for the king, you and your gillies could put myself and my\nsons into five sacks of bran.”",
        "“The plan that has come into your head is not bad,” said the miller.",
        "The miller spoke to his gillies, and he said to them to do this, and\nthey put them in five sacks. The king’s gillies came to seek the\nbran, and they took the five sacks with them, and they emptied them\nbefore the horses. The servants locked the door, and they went away.",
        "When they rose to lay hand on the brown horse, said Conall, “You\nshall not do that. It is hard to get out of this; let us make for\nourselves five hiding holes, so that if they hear us we may go and\nhide.” They made the holes, then they laid hands on the horse. The\nhorse was pretty well unbroken, and he set to making a terrible\nnoise through the stable. The king heard the noise. “It must be my\nbrown horse,” said he to his gillies; “find out what is wrong with\nhim.”",
        "The servants went out, and when Conall and his sons saw them coming\nthey went into the hiding holes. The servants looked amongst the\nhorses, and they did not find anything wrong; and they returned and\nthey told this to the king, and the king said to them that if\nnothing was wrong they should go to their places of rest. When the\ngillies had time to be gone, Conall and his sons laid their hands\nagain on the horse. If the noise was great that he made before, the\nnoise he made now was seven times greater. The king sent a message\nfor his gillies again, and said for certain there was something\ntroubling the brown horse. “Go and look well about him.” The\nservants went out, and they went to their hiding holes. The servants\nrummaged well, and did not find a thing. They returned and they told\nthis.",
        "“That is marvellous for me,” said the king: “go you to lie down\nagain, and if I notice it again I will go out myself.”",
        "When Conall and his sons perceived that the gillies were gone, they\nlaid hands again on the horse, and one of them caught him, and if\nthe noise that the horse made on the two former times was great, he\nmade more this time.",
        "“Be this from me,” said the king; “it must be that some one is\ntroubling my brown horse.” He sounded the bell hastily, and when his\nwaiting-man came to him, he said to him to let the stable gillies\nknow that something was wrong with the horse. The gillies came, and\nthe king went with them. When Conall and his sons perceived the\ncompany coming they went to the hiding holes.",
        "The king was a wary man, and he saw where the horses were making a\nnoise.",
        "“Be wary,” said the king, “there are men within the stable, let us\nget at them somehow.”",
        "The king followed the tracks of the men, and he found them. Every\none knew Conall, for he was a valued tenant of the king of Erin, and\nwhen the king brought them up out of the holes he said, “Oh, Conall,\nis it you that are here?”",
        "“I am, O king, without question, and necessity made me come. I am\nunder thy pardon, and under thine honour, and under thy grace.” He\ntold how it happened to him, and that he had to get the brown horse\nfor the king of Erin, or that his sons were to be put to death. “I\nknew that I should not get him by asking, and I was going to steal\nhim.”",
        "“Yes, Conall, it is well enough, but come in,” said the king. He\ndesired his look-out men to set a watch on the sons of Conall, and\nto give them meat. And a double watch was set that night on the sons\nof Conall.",
        "“Now, O Conall,” said the king, “were you ever in a harder place\nthan to be seeing your lot of sons hanged tomorrow? But you set it\nto my goodness and to my grace, and say that it was necessity\nbrought it on you, so I must not hang you. Tell me any case in which\nyou were as hard as this, and if you tell that, you shall get the\nsoul of your youngest son.”",
        "“I will tell a case as hard in which I was,” said Conall. “I was\nonce a young lad, and my father had much land, and he had parks of\nyear-old cows, and one of them had just calved, and my father told\nme to bring her home. I found the cow, and took her with us. There\nfell a shower of snow. We went into the herd’s bothy, and we took\nthe cow and the calf in with us, and we were letting the shower pass\nfrom us. Who should come in but one cat and ten, and one great one-\neyed fox-coloured cat as head bard over them. When they came in, in\nvery deed I myself had no liking for their company. ’Strike up with\nyou,’ said the head bard, ’why should we be still? and sing a cronan\nto Conall Yellowclaw.’ I was amazed that my name was known to the\ncats themselves. When they had sung the cronan, said the head bard,\n’Now, O Conall, pay the reward of the cronan that the cats have sung\nto thee.’ ’Well then,’ said I myself, ’I have no reward whatsoever\nfor you, unless you should go down and take that calf.’ No sooner\nsaid I the word than the two cats and ten went down to attack the\ncalf, and in very deed, he did not last them long. ’Play up with\nyou, why should you be silent? Make a cronan to Conall Yellowclaw,’\nsaid the head bard. Certainly I had no liking at all for the cronan,\nbut up came the one cat and ten, and if they did not sing me a\ncronan then and there! ’Pay them now their reward,’ said the great\nfox-coloured cat. ’I am tired myself of yourselves and your\nrewards,’ said I. ’I have no reward for you unless you take that cow\ndown there.’ They betook themselves to the cow, and indeed she did\nnot last them long.",
        "“’Why will you be silent? Go up and sing a cronan to Conall\nYellowclaw,’ said the head bard. And surely, oh king, I had no care\nfor them or for their cronan, for I began to see that they were not\ngood comrades. When they had sung me the cronan they betook\nthemselves down where the head bard was. ’Pay now their reward, said\nthe head bard; and for sure, oh king, I had no reward for them; and\nI said to them, ’I have no reward for you.’ And surely, oh king,\nthere was catterwauling between them. So I leapt out at a turf\nwindow that was at the back of the house. I took myself off as hard\nas I might into the wood. I was swift enough and strong at that\ntime; and when I felt the rustling toirm of the cats after me I\nclimbed into as high a tree as I saw in the place, and one that was\nclose in the top; and I hid myself as well as I might. The cats\nbegan to search for me through the wood, and they could not find me;\nand when they were tired, each one said to the other that they would\nturn back. ’But,’ said the one-eyed fox-coloured cat that was\ncommander-in-chief over them, ’you saw him not with your two eyes,\nand though I have but one eye, there’s the rascal up in the tree.’\nWhen he had said that, one of them went up in the tree, and as he\nwas coming where I was, I drew a weapon that I had and I killed him.\n’Be this from me!’ said the one-eyed one–’I must not be losing my\ncompany thus; gather round the root of the tree and dig about it,\nand let down that villain to earth.’ On this they gathered about the\ntree, and they dug about the root, and the first branching root that\nthey cut, she gave a shiver to fall, and I myself gave a shout, and\nit was not to be wondered at.",
        "“There was in the neighbourhood of the wood a priest, and he had ten\nmen with him delving, and he said, ’There is a shout of a man in\nextremity and I must not be without replying to it.’ And the wisest\nof the men said, ’Let it alone till we hear it again.’ The cats\nbegan again digging wildly, and they broke the next root; and I\nmyself gave the next shout, and in very deed it was not a weak one.\n’Certainly,’ said the priest, ’it is a man in extremity–let us\nmove.’ They set themselves in order for moving. And the cats arose\non the tree, and they broke the third root, and the tree fell on her\nelbow. Then I gave the third shout. The stalwart men hastened, and\nwhen they saw how the cats served the tree, they began at them with\nthe spades; and they themselves and the cats began at each other,\ntill the cats ran away. And surely, oh king, I did not move till I\nsaw the last one of them off. And then I came home. And there’s the\nhardest case in which I ever was; and it seems to me that tearing by\nthe cats were harder than hanging to-morrow by the king of\nLochlann.”",
        "“Och! Conall,” said the king, “you are full of words. You have freed\nthe soul of your son with your tale; and if you tell me a harder\ncase than that you will get your second youngest son, and then you\nwill have two sons.”",
        "“Well then,” said Conall, “on condition that thou dost that, I will\ntell thee how I was once in a harder case than to be in thy power in\nprison to-night.”",
        "“Let’s hear,” said the king.",
        "“I was then,” said Conall, “quite a young lad, and I went out\nhunting, and my father’s land was beside the sea, and it was rough\nwith rocks, caves, and rifts. When I was going on the top of the\nshore, I saw as if there were a smoke coming up between two rocks,\nand I began to look what might be the meaning of the smoke coming up\nthere. When I was looking, what should I do but fall; and the place\nwas so full of heather, that neither bone nor skin was broken. I\nknew not how I should get out of this. I was not looking before me,\nbut I kept looking overhead the way I came–and thinking that the\nday would never come that I could get up there. It was terrible for\nme to be there till I should die. I heard a great clattering coming,\nand what was there but a great giant and two dozen of goats with\nhim, and a buck at their head. And when the giant had tied the\ngoats, he came up and he said to me, ’Hao O! Conall, it’s long since\nmy knife has been rusting in my pouch waiting for thy tender flesh.’\n’Och!’ said I, ’it’s not much you will be bettered by me, though you\nshould tear me asunder; I will make but one meal for you. But I see\nthat you are one-eyed. I am a good leech, and I will give you the\nsight of the other eye.’ The giant went and he drew the great\ncaldron on the site of the fire. I myself was telling him how he\nshould heat the water, so that I should give its sight to the other\neye. I got heather and I made a rubber of it, and I set him upright\nin the caldron. I began at the eye that was well, pretending to him\nthat I would give its sight to the other one, till I left them as\nbad as each other; and surely it was easier to spoil the one that\nwas well than to give sight to the other.",
        "“When he saw that he could not see a glimpse, and when I myself said\nto him that I would get out in spite of him, he gave a spring out of\nthe water, and he stood in the mouth of the cave, and he said that\nhe would have revenge for the sight of his eye. I had but to stay\nthere crouched the length of the night, holding in my breath in such\na way that he might not find out where I was.",
        "“When he felt the birds calling in the morning, and knew that the\nday was, he said–’Art thou sleeping? Awake and let out my lot of\ngoats.’ I killed the buck. He cried, ’I do believe that thou art\nkilling my buck.’",
        "“’I am not,’ said I, ’but the ropes are so tight that I take long to\nloose them.’ I let out one of the goats, and there he was caressing\nher, and he said to her, ’There thou art thou shaggy, hairy white\ngoat; and thou seest me, but I see thee not.’ I kept letting them\nout by the way of one and one, as I flayed the buck, and before the\nlast one was out I had him flayed bag-wise. Then I went and I put my\nlegs in place of his legs, and my hands in place of his forelegs,\nand my head in place of his head, and the horns on top of my head,\nso that the brute might think that it was the buck. I went out. When\nI was going out the giant laid his hand on me, and he said, ’There\nthou art, thou pretty buck; thou seest me, but I see thee not.’ When\nI myself got out, and I saw the world about me, surely, oh, king!\njoy was on me. When I was out and had shaken the skin off me, I said\nto the brute, ’I am out now in spite of you.’",
        "“’Aha!’ said he, ’hast thou done this to me. Since thou wert so\nstalwart that thou hast got out, I will give thee a ring that I have\nhere; keep the ring, and it will do thee good.’",
        "“’I will not take the ring from you,’ said I, ’but throw it, and I\nwill take it with me.’ He threw the ring on the flat ground, I went\nmyself and I lifted the ring, and I put it on my finger. When he\nsaid me then, ’Is the ring fitting thee?’ I said to him, ’It is.’\nThen he said, ’Where art thou, ring?’ And the ring said, ’I am\nhere.’ The brute went and went towards where the ring was speaking,\nand now I saw that I was in a harder case than ever I was. I drew a\ndirk. I cut the finger from off me, and I threw it from me as far as\nI could out on the loch, and there was a great depth in the place.\nHe shouted, ’Where art thou, ring?’ And the ring said, ’I am here,’\nthough it was on the bed of ocean. He gave a spring after the ring,\nand out he went in the sea. And I was as pleased then when I saw him\ndrowning, as though you should grant my own life and the life of my\ntwo sons with me, and not lay any more trouble on me.",
        "“When the giant was drowned I went in, and I took with me all he had\nof gold and silver, and I went home, and surely great joy was on my\npeople when I arrived. And as a sign now look, the finger is off\nme.”",
        "“Yes, indeed, Conall, you are wordy and wise,” said the king. “I see\nthe finger is off you. You have freed your two sons, but tell me a\ncase in which you ever were that is harder than to be looking on\nyour son being hanged tomorrow, and you shall get the soul of your\neldest son.”",
        "“Then went my father,” said Conall, “and he got me a wife, and I was\nmarried. I went to hunt. I was going beside the sea, and I saw an\nisland over in the midst of the loch, and I came there where a boat\nwas with a rope before her, and a rope behind her, and many precious\nthings within her. I looked myself on the boat to see how I might\nget part of them. I put in the one foot, and the other foot was on\nthe ground, and when I raised my head what was it but the boat over\nin the middle of the loch, and she never stopped till she reached\nthe island. When I went out of the boat the boat returned where she\nwas before. I did not know now what I should do. The place was\nwithout meat or clothing, without the appearance of a house on it. I\ncame out on the top of a hill. Then I came to a glen; I saw in it,\nat the bottom of a hollow, a woman with a child, and the child was\nnaked on her knee, and she had a knife in her hand. She tried to put\nthe knife to the throat of the babe, and the babe began to laugh in\nher face, and she began to cry, and she threw the knife behind her.\nI thought to myself that I was near my foe and far from my friends,\nand I called to the woman, ’What are you doing here?’ And she said\nto me, ’What brought you here?’ I told her myself word upon word how\nI came. ’Well then,’ said she, ’it was so I came also.’ She showed\nme to the place where I should come in where she was. I went in, and\nI said to her, ’What was the matter that you were putting the knife\non the neck of the child?’ ’It is that he must be cooked for the\ngiant who is here, or else no more of my world will be before me.’\nJust then we could be hearing the footsteps of the giant, ’What\nshall I do? what shall I do?’ cried the woman. I went to the\ncaldron, and by luck it was not hot, so in it I got just as the\nbrute came in. ’Hast thou boiled that youngster for me?’ he cried.\n’He’s not done yet,’ said she, and I cried out from the caldron,\n’Mammy, mammy, it’s boiling I am.’ Then the giant laughed out HAI,\nHAW, HOGARAICH, and heaped on wood under the caldron.",
        "“And now I was sure I would scald before I could get out of that. As\nfortune favoured me, the brute slept beside the caldron. There I was\nscalded by the bottom of the caldron. When she perceived that he was\nasleep, she set her mouth quietly to the hole that was in the lid,\nand she said to me ’was I alive?’ I said I was. I put up my head,\nand the hole in the lid was so large, that my head went through\neasily. Everything was coming easily with me till I began to bring\nup my hips. I left the skin of my hips behind me, but I came out.\nWhen I got out of the caldron I knew not what to do; and she said to\nme that there was no weapon that would kill him but his own weapon.\nI began to draw his spear and every breath that he drew I thought I\nwould be down his throat, and when his breath came out I was back\nagain just as far. But with every ill that befell me I got the spear\nloosed from him. Then I was as one under a bundle of straw in a\ngreat wind for I could not manage the spear. And it was fearful to\nlook on the brute, who had but one eye in the midst of his face; and\nit was not agreeable for the like of me to attack him. I drew the\ndart as best I could, and I set it in his eye. When he felt this he\ngave his head a lift, and he struck the other end of the dart on the\ntop of the cave, and it went through to the back of his head. And he\nfell cold dead where he was; and you may be sure, oh king, that joy\nwas on me. I myself and the woman went out on clear ground, and we\npassed the night there. I went and got the boat with which I came,\nand she was no way lightened, and took the woman and the child over\non dry land; and I returned home.”",
        "The king of Lochlann’s mother was putting on a fire at this time,\nand listening to Conall telling the tale about the child.",
        "“Is it you,” said she, “that were there?”",
        "“Well then,” said he, “’twas I.”",
        "“Och! och!” said she, “’twas I that was there, and the king is the\nchild whose life you saved; and it is to you that life thanks should\nbe given.” Then they took great joy.",
        "The king said, “Oh, Conall, you came through great hardships. And\nnow the brown horse is yours, and his sack full of the most precious\nthings that are in my treasury.”",
        "They lay down that night, and if it was early that Conall rose, it\nwas earlier than that that the queen was on foot making ready. He\ngot the brown horse and his sack full of gold and silver and stones\nof great price, and then Conall and his three sons went away, and\nthey returned home to the Erin realm of gladness. He left the gold\nand silver in his house, and he went with the horse to the king.\nThey were good friends evermore. He returned home to his wife, and\nthey set in order a feast; and that was a feast if ever there was\none, oh son and brother.",
        "There was once upon a time two farmers, and their names were Hudden\nand Dudden. They had poultry in their yards, sheep on the uplands,\nand scores of cattle in the meadow-land alongside the river. But for\nall that they weren’t happy. For just between their two farms there\nlived a poor man by the name of Donald O’Neary. He had a hovel over\nhis head and a strip of grass that was barely enough to keep his one\ncow, Daisy, from starving, and, though she did her best, it was but\nseldom that Donald got a drink of milk or a roll of butter from\nDaisy. You would think there was little here to make Hudden and\nDudden jealous, but so it is, the more one has the more one wants,\nand Donald’s neighbours lay awake of nights scheming how they might\nget hold of his little strip of grass-land. Daisy, poor thing, they\nnever thought of; she was just a bag of bones.",
        "One day Hudden met Dudden, and they were soon grumbling as usual,\nand all to the tune of “If only we could get that vagabond Donald\nO’Neary out of the country.”",
        "“Let’s kill Daisy,” said Hudden at last; “if that doesn’t make him\nclear out, nothing will.”",
        "No sooner said than agreed, and it wasn’t dark before Hudden and\nDudden crept up to the little shed where lay poor Daisy trying her\nbest to chew the cud, though she hadn’t had as much grass in the day\nas would cover your hand. And when Donald came to see if Daisy was\nall snug for the night, the poor beast had only time to lick his\nhand once before she died.",
        "Well, Donald was a shrewd fellow, and downhearted though he was,\nbegan to think if he could get any good out of Daisy’s death. He\nthought and he thought, and the next day you could have seen him\ntrudging off early to the fair, Daisy’s hide over his shoulder,\nevery penny he had jingling in his pockets. Just before he got to\nthe fair, he made several slits in the hide, put a penny in each\nslit, walked into the best inn of the town as bold as if it belonged\nto him, and, hanging the hide up to a nail in the wall, sat down.",
        "“Some of your best whisky,” says he to the landlord.",
        "But the landlord didn’t like his looks. “Is it fearing I won’t pay\nyou, you are?” says Donald; “why I have a hide here that gives me\nall the money I want.” And with that he hit it a whack with his\nstick and out hopped a penny. The landlord opened his eyes, as you\nmay fancy.",
        "“What’ll you take for that hide?”",
        "“It’s not for sale, my good man.”",
        "“Will you take a gold piece?”",
        "“It’s not for sale, I tell you. Hasn’t it kept me and mine for\nyears?” and with that Donald hit the hide another whack and out\njumped a second penny.",
        "Well, the long and the short of it was that Donald let the hide go,\nand, that very evening, who but he should walk up to Hudden’s door?",
        "“Good-evening, Hudden. Will you lend me your best pair of scales?”",
        "Hudden stared and Hudden scratched his head, but he lent the scales.",
        "When Donald was safe at home, he pulled out his pocketful of bright\ngold and began to weigh each piece in the scales. But Hudden had put\na lump of butter at the bottom, and so the last piece of gold stuck\nfast to the scales when he took them back to Hudden.",
        "If Hudden had stared before, he stared ten times more now, and no\nsooner was Donald’s back turned, than he was of as hard as he could\npelt to Dudden’s.",
        "“Good-evening, Dudden. That vagabond, bad luck to him–”",
        "“You mean Donald O’Neary?”",
        "“And who else should I mean? He’s back here weighing out sackfuls of\ngold.”",
        "“How do you know that?”",
        "“Here are my scales that he borrowed, and here’s a gold piece still\nsticking to them.”",
        "Off they went together, and they came to Donald’s door. Donald had\nfinished making the last pile of ten gold pieces. And he couldn’t\nfinish because a piece had stuck to the scales.",
        "In they walked without an “If you please” or “By your leave.”",
        "“Well, I never!” that was all they could say.",
        "“Good-evening, Hudden; good-evening, Dudden. Ah! you thought you had\nplayed me a fine trick, but you never did me a better turn in all\nyour lives. When I found poor Daisy dead, I thought to myself,\n’Well, her hide may fetch something;’ and it did. Hides are worth\ntheir weight in gold in the market just now.”",
        "Hudden nudged Dudden, and Dudden winked at Hudden.",
        "“Good-evening, Donald O’Neary.”",
        "“Good-evening, kind friends.”",
        "The next day there wasn’t a cow or a calf that belonged to Hudden or\nDudden but her hide was going to the fair in Hudden’s biggest cart\ndrawn by Dudden’s strongest pair of horses.",
        "When they came to the fair, each one took a hide over his arm, and\nthere they were walking through the fair, bawling out at the top of\ntheir voices: “Hides to sell! hides to sell!”",
        "Out came the tanner:",
        "“How much for your hides, my good men?”",
        "“Their weight in gold.”",
        "“It’s early in the day to come out of the tavern.”",
        "That was all the tanner said, and back he went to his yard.",
        "“Hides to sell! Fine fresh hides to sell!”",
        "Out came the cobbler.",
        "“How much for your hides, my men?”",
        "“Their weight in gold.”",
        "“Is it making game of me you are! Take that for your pains,” and the\ncobbler dealt Hudden a blow that made him stagger.",
        "Up the people came running from one end of the fair to the other.\n\"What’s the matter? What’s the matter?” cried they.",
        "“Here are a couple of vagabonds selling hides at their weight in\ngold,” said the cobbler.",
        "“Hold ’em fast; hold ’em fast!” bawled the innkeeper, who was the\nlast to come up, he was so fat. “I’ll wager it’s one of the rogues\nwho tricked me out of thirty gold pieces yesterday for a wretched\nhide.”",
        "It was more kicks than halfpence that Hudden and Dudden got before\nthey were well on their way home again, and they didn’t run the\nslower because all the dogs of the town were at their heels.",
        "Well, as you may fancy, if they loved Donald little before, they\nloved him less now.",
        "“What’s the matter, friends?” said he, as he saw them tearing along,\ntheir hats knocked in, and their coats torn off, and their faces\nblack and blue. “Is it fighting you’ve been? or mayhap you met the\npolice, ill luck to them?”",
        "“We’ll police you, you vagabond. It’s mighty smart you thought\nyourself, deluding us with your lying tales.”",
        "“Who deluded you? Didn’t you see the gold with your own two eyes?”",
        "But it was no use talking. Pay for it he must, and should. There was\na meal-sack handy, and into it Hudden and Dudden popped Donald\nO’Neary, tied him up tight, ran a pole through the knot, and off\nthey started for the Brown Lake of the Bog, each with a pole-end on\nhis shoulder, and Donald O’Neary between.",
        "But the Brown Lake was far, the road was dusty, Hudden and Dudden\nwere sore and weary, and parched with thirst. There was an inn by\nthe roadside.",
        "“Let’s go in,” said Hudden; “I’m dead beat. It’s heavy he is for the\nlittle he had to eat.”",
        "If Hudden was willing, so was Dudden. As for Donald, you may be sure\nhis leave wasn’t asked, but he was lumped down at the inn door for\nall the world as if he had been a sack of potatoes.",
        "“Sit still, you vagabond,” said Dudden; “if we don’t mind waiting,\nyou needn’t.”",
        "Donald held his peace, but after a while he heard the glasses clink,\nand Hudden singing away at the top of his voice.",
        "“I won’t have her, I tell you; I won’t have her!” said Donald. But\nnobody heeded what he said.",
        "“I won’t have her, I tell you; I won’t have her!” said Donald, and\nthis time he said it louder; but nobody heeded what he said.",
        "“I won’t have her, I tell you; I won’t have her!” said Donald; and\nthis time he said it as loud as he could.",
        "“And who won’t you have, may I be so bold as to ask?” said a farmer,\nwho had just come up with a drove of cattle, and was turning in for\na glass.",
        "“It’s the king’s daughter. They are bothering the life out of me to\nmarry her.”",
        "“You’re the lucky fellow. I’d give something to be in your shoes.”",
        "“Do you see that now! Wouldn’t it be a fine thing for a farmer to be\nmarrying a princess, all dressed in gold and jewels?”",
        "“Jewels, do you say? Ah, now, couldn’t you take me with you?”",
        "“Well, you’re an honest fellow, and as I don’t care for the king’s\ndaughter, though she’s as beautiful as the day, and is covered with\njewels from top to toe, you shall have her. Just undo the cord, and\nlet me out; they tied me up tight, as they knew I’d run away from\nher.”",
        "Out crawled Donald; in crept the farmer.",
        "“Now lie still, and don’t mind the shaking; it’s only rumbling over\nthe palace steps you’ll be. And maybe they’ll abuse you for a\nvagabond, who won’t have the king’s daughter; but you needn’t mind\nthat. Ah! it’s a deal I’m giving up for you, sure as it is that I\ndon’t care for the princess.”",
        "“Take my cattle in exchange,” said the farmer; and you may guess it\nwasn’t long before Donald was at their tails driving them homewards.",
        "Out came Hudden and Dudden, and the one took one end of the pole,\nand the other the other.",
        "“I’m thinking he’s heavier,” said Hudden.",
        "“Ah, never mind,” said Dudden; “it’s only a step now to the Brown\nLake.”",
        "“I’ll have her now! I’ll have her now!” bawled the farmer, from\ninside the sack.",
        "“By my faith, and you shall though,” said Hudden, and he laid his\nstick across the sack.",
        "“I’ll have her! I’ll have her!” bawled the farmer, louder than ever.",
        "“Well, here you are,” said Dudden, for they were now come to the\nBrown Lake, and, unslinging the sack, they pitched it plump into the\nlake.",
        "“You’ll not be playing your tricks on us any longer,” said Hudden.",
        "“True for you,” said Dudden. “Ah, Donald, my boy, it was an ill day\nwhen you borrowed my scales.”",
        "Off they went, with a light step and an easy heart, but when they\nwere near home, who should they see but Donald O’Neary, and all\naround him the cows were grazing, and the calves were kicking up\ntheir heels and butting their heads together.",
        "“Is it you, Donald?” said Dudden. “Faith, you’ve been quicker than\nwe have.”",
        "“True for you, Dudden, and let me thank you kindly; the turn was\ngood, if the will was ill. You’ll have heard, like me, that the\nBrown Lake leads to the Land of Promise. I always put it down as\nlies, but it is just as true as my word. Look at the cattle.”",
        "Hudden stared, and Dudden gaped; but they couldn’t get over the\ncattle; fine fat cattle they were too.",
        "“It’s only the worst I could bring up with me,” said Donald O’Neary;\n\"the others were so fat, there was no driving them. Faith, too, it’s\nlittle wonder they didn’t care to leave, with grass as far as you\ncould see, and as sweet and juicy as fresh butter.”",
        "“Ah, now, Donald, we haven’t always been friends,” said Dudden,\n\"but, as I was just saying, you were ever a decent lad, and you’ll\nshow us the way, won’t you?”",
        "“I don’t see that I’m called upon to do that; there is a power more\ncattle down there. Why shouldn’t I have them all to myself?”",
        "“Faith, they may well say, the richer you get, the harder the heart.\nYou always were a neighbourly lad, Donald. You wouldn’t wish to keep\nthe luck all to yourself?”",
        "“True for you, Hudden, though ’tis a bad example you set me. But\nI’ll not be thinking of old times. There is plenty for all there, so\ncome along with me.”",
        "Off they trudged, with a light heart and an eager step. When they\ncame to the Brown Lake, the sky was full of little white clouds,\nand, if the sky was full, the lake was as full.",
        "“Ah! now, look, there they are,” cried Donald, as he pointed to the\nclouds in the lake.",
        "“Where? where?” cried Hudden, and “Don’t be greedy!” cried Dudden,\nas he jumped his hardest to be up first with the fat cattle. But if\nhe jumped first, Hudden wasn’t long behind.",
        "They never came back. Maybe they got too fat, like the cattle. As\nfor Donald O’Neary, he had cattle and sheep all his days to his\nheart’s content.",
        "Up in the Black Mountains in Caermarthenshire lies the lake known as\nLyn y Van Vach. To the margin of this lake the shepherd of Myddvai\nonce led his lambs, and lay there whilst they sought pasture.\nSuddenly, from the dark waters of the lake, he saw three maidens\nrise. Shaking the bright drops from their hair and gliding to the\nshore, they wandered about amongst his flock. They had more than\nmortal beauty, and he was filled with love for her that came nearest\nto him. He offered her the bread he had with him, and she took it\nand tried it, but then sang to him:",
        "  Hard-baked is thy bread,\n  ’Tis not easy to catch me,",
        "and then ran off laughing to the lake.",
        "Next day he took with him bread not so well done, and watched for\nthe maidens. When they came ashore he offered his bread as before,\nand the maiden tasted it and sang:",
        "  Unbaked is thy bread,\n  I will not have thee,",
        "and again disappeared in the waves.",
        "A third time did the shepherd of Myddvai try to attract the maiden,\nand this time he offered her bread that he had found floating about\nnear the shore. This pleased her, and she promised to become his\nwife if he were able to pick her out from among her sisters on the\nfollowing day. When the time came the shepherd knew his love by the\nstrap of her sandal. Then she told him she would be as good a wife\nto him as any earthly maiden could be unless he should strike her\nthree times without cause. Of course he deemed that this could never\nbe; and she, summoning from the lake three cows, two oxen, and a\nbull, as her marriage portion, was led homeward by him as his bride.",
        "The years passed happily, and three children were born to the\nshepherd and the lake-maiden. But one day here were going to a\nchristening, and she said to her husband it was far to walk, so he\ntold her to go for the horses.",
        "“I will,” said she, “if you bring me my gloves which I’ve left in\nthe house.”",
        "But when he came back with the gloves, he found she had not gone for\nthe horses; so he tapped her lightly on the shoulder with the\ngloves, and said, “Go, go.”",
        "“That’s one,” said she.",
        "Another time they were at a wedding, when suddenly the lake-maiden\nfell a-sobbing and a-weeping, amid the joy and mirth of all around\nher.",
        "Her husband tapped her on the shoulder, and asked her, “Why do you\nweep?”",
        "“Because they are entering into trouble; and trouble is upon you;\nfor that is the second causeless blow you have given me. Be careful;\nthe third is the last.”",
        "The husband was careful never to strike her again. But one day at a\nfuneral she suddenly burst out into fits of laughter. Her husband\nforgot, and touched her rather roughly on the shoulder, saying, “Is\nthis a time for laughter?”",
        "“I laugh,” she said, “because those that die go out of trouble, but\nyour trouble has come. The last blow has been struck; our marriage\nis at an end, and so farewell.” And with that she rose up and left\nthe house and went to their home.",
        "Then she, looking round upon her home, called to the cattle she had\nbrought with her:",
        "  Brindle cow, white speckled,\n  Spotted cow, bold freckled,\n  Old white face, and gray Geringer,\n  And the white bull from the king’s coast,\n  Grey ox, and black calf,\n  All, all, follow me home,",
        "Now the black calf had just been slaughtered, and was hanging on the\nhook; but it got off the hook alive and well and followed her; and\nthe oxen, though they were ploughing, trailed the plough with them\nand did her bidding. So she fled to the lake again, they following\nher, and with them plunged into the dark waters.",
        "And to this day is the furrow seen which the plough left as it was\ndragged across the mountains to the tarn.",
        "Only once did she come again, when her sons were grown to manhood,\nand then she gave them gifts of healing by which they won the name\nof Meddygon Myddvai, the physicians of Myddvai.",
        "A sprightly tailor was employed by the great Macdonald, in his\ncastle at Saddell, in order to make the laird a pair of trews, used\nin olden time. And trews being the vest and breeches united in one\npiece, and ornamented with fringes, were very comfortable, and\nsuitable to be worn in walking or dancing. And Macdonald had said to\nthe tailor, that if he would make the trews by night in the church,\nhe would get a handsome reward. For it was thought that the old\nruined church was haunted, and that fearsome things were to be seen\nthere at night.",
        "The tailor was well aware of this; but he was a sprightly man, and\nwhen the laird dared him to make the trews by night in the church,\nthe tailor was not to be daunted, but took it in hand to gain the\nprize. So, when night came, away he went up the glen, about half a\nmile distance from the castle, till he came to the old church. Then\nhe chose him a nice gravestone for a seat and he lighted his candle,\nand put on his thimble, and set to work at the trews; plying his\nneedle nimbly, and thinking about the hire that the laird would have\nto give him.",
        "For some time he got on pretty well, until he felt the floor all of\na tremble under his feet; and looking about him, but keeping his\nfingers at work, he saw the appearance of a great human head rising\nup through the stone pavement of the church. And when the head had\nrisen above the surface, there came from it a great, great voice.\nAnd the voice said: “Do you see this great head of mine?”",
        "“I see that, but I’ll sew this!” replied the sprightly tailor; and\nhe stitched away at the trews.",
        "Then the head rose higher up through the pavement, until its neck\nappeared. And when its neck was shown, the thundering voice came\nagain and said: “Do you see this great neck of mine?”",
        "“I see that, but I’ll sew this!” said the sprightly tailor; and he\nstitched away at his trews.",
        "Then the head and neck rose higher still, until the great shoulders\nand chest were shown above the ground. And again the mighty voice\nthundered: “Do you see this great chest of mine?”",
        "And again the sprightly tailor replied: “I see that, but I’ll sew\nthis!” and stitched away at his trews.",
        "And still it kept rising through the pavement, until it shook a\ngreat pair of arms in the tailor’s face, and said: “Do you see these\ngreat arms of mine?”",
        "“I see those, but I’ll sew this!” answered the tailor; and he\nstitched hard at his trews, for he knew that he had no time to lose.",
        "The sprightly tailor was taking the long stitches, when he saw it\ngradually rising and rising through the floor, until it lifted out a\ngreat leg, and stamping with it upon the pavement, said in a roaring\nvoice: “Do you see this great leg of mine?”",
        "“Aye, aye: I see that, but I’ll sew this!” cried the tailor; and his\nfingers flew with the needle, and he took such long stitches, that\nhe was just come to the end of the trews, when it was taking up its\nother leg. But before it could pull it out of the pavement, the\nsprightly tailor had finished his task; and, blowing out his candle,\nand springing from off his gravestone, he buckled up, and ran out of\nthe church with the trews under his arm. Then the fearsome thing\ngave a loud roar, and stamped with both his feet upon the pavement,\nand out of the church he went after the sprightly tailor.",
        "Down the glen they ran, faster than the stream when the flood rides\nit; but the tailor had got the start and a nimble pair of legs, and\nhe did not choose to lose the laird’s reward. And though the thing\nroared to him to stop, yet the sprightly tailor was not the man to\nbe beholden to a monster. So he held his trews tight, and let no\ndarkness grow under his feet, until he had reached Saddell Castle.\nHe had no sooner got inside the gate, and shut it, than the\napparition came up to it; and, enraged at losing his prize, struck\nthe wall above the gate, and left there the mark of his five great\nfingers. Ye may see them plainly to this day, if ye’ll only peer\nclose enough.",
        "But the sprightly tailor gained his reward: for Macdonald paid him\nhandsomely for the trews, and never discovered that a few of the\nstitches were somewhat long.",
        "There was a man in Ireland once who was called Malcolm Harper. The\nman was a right good man, and he had a goodly share of this world’s\ngoods. He had a wife, but no family. What did Malcolm hear but that\na soothsayer had come home to the place, and as the man was a right\ngood man, he wished that the soothsayer might come near them.\nWhether it was that he was invited or that he came of himself, the\nsoothsayer came to the house of Malcolm.",
        "“Are you doing any soothsaying?” says Malcolm.",
        "“Yes, I am doing a little. Are you in need of soothsaying?”",
        "“Well, I do not mind taking soothsaying from you, if you had\nsoothsaying for me, and you would be willing to do it.”",
        "“Well, I will do soothsaying for you. What kind of soothsaying do\nyou want?”",
        "“Well, the soothsaying I wanted was that you would tell me my lot or\nwhat will happen to me, if you can give me knowledge of it.”",
        "“Well, I am going out, and when I return, I will tell you.”",
        "And the soothsayer went forth out of the house and he was not long\noutside when he returned.",
        "“Well,” said the soothsayer, “I saw in my second sight that it is on\naccount of a daughter of yours that the greatest amount of blood\nshall be shed that has ever been shed in Erin since time and race\nbegan. And the three most famous heroes that ever were found will\nlose their heads on her account.”",
        "After a time a daughter was born to Malcolm, he did not allow a\nliving being to come to his house, only himself and the nurse. He\nasked this woman, “Will you yourself bring up the child to keep her\nin hiding far away where eye will not see a sight of her nor ear\nhear a word about her?”",
        "The woman said she would, so Malcolm got three men, and he took them\naway to a large mountain, distant and far from reach, without the\nknowledge or notice of any one. He caused there a hillock, round and\ngreen, to be dug out of the middle, and the hole thus made to be\ncovered carefully over so that a little company could dwell there\ntogether. This was done.",
        "Deirdre and her foster-mother dwelt in the bothy mid the hills\nwithout the knowledge or the suspicion of any living person about\nthem and without anything occurring, until Deirdre was sixteen years\nof age. Deirdre grew like the white sapling, straight and trim as\nthe rash on the moss. She was the creature of fairest form, of\nloveliest aspect, and of gentlest nature that existed between earth\nand heaven in all Ireland–whatever colour of hue she had before,\nthere was nobody that looked into her face but she would blush fiery\nred over it.",
        "The woman that had charge of her, gave Deirdre every information and\nskill of which she herself had knowledge and skill. There was not a\nblade of grass growing from root, nor a bird singing in the wood,\nnor a star shining from heaven but Deirdre had a name for it. But\none thing, she did not wish her to have either part or parley with\nany single living man of the rest of the world. But on a gloomy\nwinter night, with black, scowling clouds, a hunter of game was\nwearily travelling the hills, and what happened but that he missed\nthe trail of the hunt, and lost his course and companions. A\ndrowsiness came upon the man as he wearily wandered over the hills,\nand he lay down by the side of the beautiful green knoll in which\nDeirdre lived, and he slept. The man was faint from hunger and\nwandering, and benumbed with cold, and a deep sleep fell upon him.\nWhen he lay down beside the green hill where Deirdre was, a troubled\ndream came to the man, and he thought that he enjoyed the warmth of\na fairy broch, the fairies being inside playing music. The hunter\nshouted out in his dream, if there was any one in the broch, to let\nhim in for the Holy One’s sake. Deirdre heard the voice and said to\nher foster-mother: “O foster-mother, what cry is that?” “It is\nnothing at all, Deirdre–merely the birds of the air astray and\nseeking each other. But let them go past to the bosky glade. There\nis no shelter or house for them here.” “Oh, foster-mother, the bird\nasked to get inside for the sake of the God of the Elements, and you\nyourself tell me that anything that is asked in His name we ought to\ndo. If you will not allow the bird that is being benumbed with cold,\nand done to death with hunger, to be let in, I do not think much of\nyour language or your faith. But since I give credence to your\nlanguage and to your faith, which you taught me, I will myself let\nin the bird.” And Deirdre arose and drew the bolt from the leaf of\nthe door, and she let in the hunter. She placed a seat in the place\nfor sitting, food in the place for eating, and drink in the place\nfor drinking for the man who came to the house. “Oh, for this life\nand raiment, you man that came in, keep restraint on your tongue!\"\nsaid the old woman. “It is not a great thing for you to keep your\nmouth shut and your tongue quiet when you get a home and shelter of\na hearth on a gloomy winter’s night.”",
        "“Well,” said the hunter, “I may do that–keep my mouth shut and my\ntongue quiet, since I came to the house and received hospitality\nfrom you; but by the hand of thy father and grandfather, and by your\nown two hands, if some other of the people of the world saw this\nbeauteous creature you have here hid away, they would not long leave\nher with you, I swear.”",
        "“What men are these you refer to?” said Deirdre.",
        "“Well, I will tell you, young woman,” said the hunter.",
        "“They are Naois, son of Uisnech, and Allen and Arden his two\nbrothers.”",
        "“What like are these men when seen, if we were to see them?” said\nDeirdre.",
        "“Why, the aspect and form of the men when seen are these,” said the\nhunter: “they have the colour of the raven on their hair, their skin\nlike swan on the wave in whiteness, and their cheeks as the blood of\nthe brindled red calf, and their speed and their leap are those of\nthe salmon of the torrent and the deer of the grey mountain side.\nAnd Naois is head and shoulders over the rest of the people of\nErin.”",
        "“However they are,” said the nurse, “be you off from here and take\nanother road. And, King of Light and Sun! in good sooth and\ncertainty, little are my thanks for yourself or for her that let you\nin!”",
        "The hunter went away, and went straight to the palace of King\nConnachar. He sent word in to the king that he wished to speak to\nhim if he pleased. The king answered the message and came out to\nspeak to the man. “What is the reason of your journey?” said the\nking to the hunter.",
        "“I have only to tell you, O king,” said the hunter, “that I saw the\nfairest creature that ever was born in Erin, and I came to tell you\nof it.”",
        "“Who is this beauty and where is she to be seen, when she was not\nseen before till you saw her, if you did see her?”",
        "“Well, I did see her,” said the hunter. “But, if I did, no man else\ncan see her unless he get directions from me as to where she is\ndwelling.”",
        "“And will you direct me to where she dwells? and the reward of your\ndirecting me will be as good as the reward of your message,” said\nthe king.",
        "“Well, I will direct you, O king, although it is likely that this\nwill not be what they want,” said the hunter.",
        "Connachar, King of Ulster, sent for his nearest kinsmen, and he told\nthem of his intent. Though early rose the song of the birds mid the\nrocky caves and the music of the birds in the grove, earlier than\nthat did Connachar, King of Ulster, arise, with his little troop of\ndear friends, in the delightful twilight of the fresh and gentle\nMay; the dew was heavy on each bush and flower and stem, as they\nwent to bring Deirdre forth from the green knoll where she stayed.\nMany a youth was there who had a lithe leaping and lissom step when\nthey started whose step was faint, failing, and faltering when they\nreached the bothy on account of the length of the way and roughness\nof the road.",
        "“Yonder, now, down in the bottom of the glen is the bothy where the\nwoman dwells, but I will not go nearer than this to the old woman,\"\nsaid the hunter.",
        "Connachar with his band of kinsfolk went down to the green knoll\nwhere Deirdre dwelt and he knocked at the door of the bothy. The\nnurse replied, “No less than a king’s command and a king’s army\ncould put me out of my bothy to-night. And I should be obliged to\nyou, were you to tell who it is that wants me to open my bothy\ndoor.”",
        "“It is I, Connachar, King of Ulster.” When the poor woman heard who\nwas at the door, she rose with haste and let in the king and all\nthat could get in of his retinue.",
        "When the king saw the woman that was before him that he had been in\nquest of, he thought he never saw in the course of the day nor in\nthe dream of night a creature so fair as Deirdre and he gave his\nfull heart’s weight of love to her. Deirdre was raised on the\ntopmost of the heroes’ shoulders and she and her foster-mother were\nbrought to the Court of King Connachar of Ulster.",
        "With the love that Connachar had for her, he wanted to marry Deirdre\nright off there and then, will she nill she marry him. But she said\nto him, “I would be obliged to you if you will give me the respite\nof a year and a day.” He said “I will grant you that, hard though it\nis, if you will give me your unfailing promise that you will marry\nme at the year’s end.” And she gave the promise. Connachar got for\nher a woman-teacher and merry modest maidens fair that would lie\ndown and rise with her, that would play and speak with her. Deirdre\nwas clever in maidenly duties and wifely understanding, and\nConnachar thought he never saw with bodily eye a creature that\npleased him more.",
        "Deirdre and her women companions were one day out on the hillock\nbehind the house enjoying the scene, and drinking in the sun’s heat.\nWhat did they see coming but three men a-journeying. Deirdre was\nlooking at the men that were coming, and wondering at them. When the\nmen neared them, Deirdre remembered the language of the huntsman,\nand she said to herself that these were the three sons of Uisnech,\nand that this was Naois, he having what was above the bend of the\ntwo shoulders above the men of Erin all. The three brothers went\npast without taking any notice of them, without even glancing at the\nyoung girls on the hillock. What happened but that love for Naois\nstruck the heart of Deirdre, so that she could not but follow after\nhim. She girded up her raiment and went after the men that went past\nthe base of the knoll, leaving her women attendants there. Allen and\nArden had heard of the woman that Connachar, King of Ulster, had\nwith him, and they thought that, if Naois, their brother, saw her,\nhe would have her himself, more especially as she was not married to\nthe King. They perceived the woman coming, and called on one another\nto hasten their step as they had a long distance to travel, and the\ndusk of night was coming on. They did so. She cried: “Naois, son of\nUisnech, will you leave me?” “What piercing, shrill cry is that–the\nmost melodious my ear ever heard, and the shrillest that ever struck\nmy heart of all the cries I ever heard?” “It is anything else but\nthe wail of the wave-swans of Connachar,” said his brothers. “No!\nyonder is a woman’s cry of distress,” said Naois, and he swore he\nwould not go further until he saw from whom the cry came, and Naois\nturned back. Naois and Deirdre met, and Deirdre kissed Naois three\ntimes, and a kiss each to his brothers. With the confusion that she\nwas in, Deirdre went into a crimson blaze of fire, and her colour\ncame and went as rapidly as the movement of the aspen by the stream\nside. Naois thought he never saw a fairer creature, and Naois gave\nDeirdre the love that he never gave to thing, to vision, or to\ncreature but to herself.",
        "Then Naois placed Deirdre on the topmost height of his shoulder, and\ntold his brothers to keep up their pace, and they kept up their\npace. Naois thought that it would not be well for him to remain in\nErin on account of the way in which Connachar, King of Ulster, his\nuncle’s son, had gone against him because of the woman, though he\nhad not married her; and he turned back to Alba, that is, Scotland.\nHe reached the side of Loch-Ness and made his habitation there. He\ncould kill the salmon of the torrent from out his own door, and the\ndeer of the grey gorge from out his window. Naois and Deirdre and\nAllen and Arden dwelt in a tower, and they were happy so long a time\nas they were there.",
        "By this time the end of the period came at which Deirdre had to\nmarry Connachar, King of Ulster. Connachar made up his mind to take\nDeirdre away by the sword whether she was married to Naois or not.\nSo he prepared a great and gleeful feast. He sent word far and wide\nthrough Erin all to his kinspeople to come to the feast. Connachar\nthought to himself that Naois would not come though he should bid\nhim; and the scheme that arose in his mind was to send for his\nfather’s brother, Ferchar Mac Ro, and to send him on an embassy to\nNaois. He did so; and Connachar said to Ferchar, “Tell Naois, son of\nUisnech, that I am setting forth a great and gleeful feast to my\nfriends and kinspeople throughout the wide extent of Erin all, and\nthat I shall not have rest by day nor sleep by night if he and Allen\nand Arden be not partakers of the feast.”",
        "Ferchar Mac Ro and his three sons went on their journey, and reached\nthe tower where Naois was dwelling by the side of Loch Etive. The\nsons of Uisnech gave a cordial kindly welcome to Ferchar Mac Ro and\nhis three sons, and asked of him the news of Erin. “The best news\nthat I have for you,” said the hardy hero, “is that Connachar, King\nof Ulster, is setting forth a great sumptuous feast to his friends\nand kinspeople throughout the wide extent of Erin all, and he has\nvowed by the earth beneath him, by the high heaven above him, and by\nthe sun that wends to the west, that he will have no rest by day nor\nsleep by night if the sons of Uisnech, the sons of his own father’s\nbrother, will not come back to the land of their home and the soil\nof their nativity, and to the feast likewise, and he has sent us on\nembassy to invite you.”",
        "“We will go with you,” said Naois.",
        "“We will,” said his brothers.",
        "But Deirdre did not wish to go with Ferchar Mac Ro, and she tried\nevery prayer to turn Naois from going with him–she said:",
        "“I saw a vision, Naois, and do you interpret it to me,” said\nDeirdre–then she sang:",
        "  O Naois, son of Uisnech, hear\n  What was shown in a dream to me.",
        "  There came three white doves out of the South\n    Flying over the sea,\n  And drops of honey were in their mouth\n    From the hive of the honey-bee.",
        "  O Naois, son of Uisnech, hear,\n  What was shown in a dream to me.",
        "  I saw three grey hawks out of the south\n    Come flying over the sea,\n  And the red red drops they bare in their mouth\n    They were dearer than life to me.",
        "Said Naois:–",
        "  It is nought but the fear of woman’s heart,\n  And a dream of the night, Deirdre.",
        "“The day that Connachar sent the invitation to his feast will be\nunlucky for us if we don’t go, O Deirdre.”",
        "“You will go there,” said Ferchar Mac Ro; “and if Connachar show\nkindness to you, show ye kindness to him; and if he will display\nwrath towards you display ye wrath towards him, and I and my three\nsons will be with you.”",
        "“We will,” said Daring Drop. “We will,” said Hardy Holly. “We will,\"\nsaid Fiallan the Fair.",
        "“I have three sons, and they are three heroes, and in any harm or\ndanger that may befall you, they will be with you, and I myself will\nbe along with them.” And Ferchar Mac Ro gave his vow and his word in\npresence of his arms that, in any harm or danger that came in the\nway of the sons of Uisnech, he and his three sons would not leave\nhead on live body in Erin, despite sword or helmet, spear or shield,\nblade or mail, be they ever so good.",
        "Deirdre was unwilling to leave Alba, but she went with Naois.\nDeirdre wept tears in showers and she sang:",
        "  Dear is the land, the land over there,\n    Alba full of woods and lakes;\n  Bitter to my heart is leaving thee,\n    But I go away with Naois.",
        "Ferchar Mac Ro did not stop till he got the sons of Uisnech away\nwith him, despite the suspicion of Deirdre.",
        "  The coracle was put to sea,\n    The sail was hoisted to it;\n  And the second morrow they arrived\n    On the white shores of Erin.",
        "As soon as the sons of Uisnech landed in Erin, Ferchar Mac Ro sent\nword to Connachar, king of Ulster, that the men whom he wanted were\ncome, and let him now show kindness to them. “Well,” said Connachar,\n\"I did not expect that the sons of Uisnech would come, though I sent\nfor them, and I am not quite ready to receive them. But there is a\nhouse down yonder where I keep strangers, and let them go down to it\ntoday, and my house will be ready before them tomorrow.”",
        "But he that was up in the palace felt it long that he was not\ngetting word as to how matters were going on for those down in the\nhouse of the strangers. “Go you, Gelban Grednach, son of Lochlin’s\nKing, go you down and bring me information as to whether her former\nhue and complexion are on Deirdre. If they be, I will take her out\nwith edge of blade and point of sword, and if not, let Naois, son of\nUisnech, have her for himself,” said Connachar.",
        "Gelban, the cheering and charming son of Lochlin’s King, went down\nto the place of the strangers, where the sons of Uisnech and Deirdre\nwere staying. He looked in through the bicker-hole on the door-leaf.\nNow she that he gazed upon used to go into a crimson blaze of\nblushes when any one looked at her. Naois looked at Deirdre and knew\nthat some one was looking at her from the back of the door-leaf. He\nseized one of the dice on the table before him and fired it through\nthe bicker-hole, and knocked the eye out of Gelban Grednach the\nCheerful and Charming, right through the back of his head. Gelban\nreturned back to the palace of King Connachar.",
        "“You were cheerful, charming, going away, but you are cheerless,\ncharmless, returning. What has happened to you, Gelban? But have you\nseen her, and are Deirdre’s hue and complexion as before?” said\nConnachar.",
        "“Well, I have seen Deirdre, and I saw her also truly, and while I\nwas looking at her through the bicker-hole on the door, Naois, son\nof Uisnech, knocked out my eye with one of the dice in his hand. But\nof a truth and verity, although he put out even my eye, it were my\ndesire still to remain looking at her with the other eye, were it\nnot for the hurry you told me to be in,” said Gelban.",
        "“That is true,” said Connachar; “let three hundred bravo heroes go\ndown to the abode of the strangers, and let them bring hither to me\nDeirdre, and kill the rest.”",
        "Connachar ordered three hundred active heroes to go down to the\nabode of the strangers and to take Deirdre up with them and kill the\nrest. “The pursuit is coming,” said Deirdre.",
        "“Yes, but I will myself go out and stop the pursuit,” said Naois.",
        "“It is not you, but we that will go,” said Daring Drop, and Hardy\nHolly, and Fiallan the Fair; “it is to us that our father entrusted\nyour defence from harm and danger when he himself left for home.\"\nAnd the gallant youths, full noble, full manly, full handsome, with\nbeauteous brown locks, went forth girt with battle arms fit for\nfierce fight and clothed with combat dress for fierce contest fit,\nwhich was burnished, bright, brilliant, bladed, blazing, on which\nwere many pictures of beasts and birds and creeping things, lions\nand lithe-limbed tigers, brown eagle and harrying hawk and adder\nfierce; and the young heroes laid low three-thirds of the company.",
        "Connachar came out in haste and cried with wrath: “Who is there on\nthe floor of fight, slaughtering my men?”",
        "“We, the three sons of Ferchar Mac Ro.”",
        "“Well,” said the king, “I will give a free bridge to your\ngrandfather, a free bridge to your father, and a free bridge each to\nyou three brothers, if you come over to my side tonight.”",
        "“Well, Connachar, we will not accept that offer from you nor thank\nyou for it. Greater by far do we prefer to go home to our father and\ntell the deeds of heroism we have done, than accept anything on\nthese terms from you. Naois, son of Uisnech, and Allen and Arden are\nas nearly related to yourself as they are to us, though you are so\nkeen to shed their blood, and you would shed our blood also,\nConnachar.” And the noble, manly, handsome youths with beauteous,\nbrown locks returned inside. “We are now,” said they, “going home to\ntell our father that you are now safe from the hands of the king.\"\nAnd the youths all fresh and tall and lithe and beautiful, went home\nto their father to tell that the sons of Uisnech were safe. This\nhappened at the parting of the day and night in the morning twilight\ntime, and Naois said they must go away, leave that house, and return\nto Alba.",
        "Naois and Deirdre, Allan and Arden started to return to Alba. Word\ncame to the king that the company he was in pursuit of were gone.\nThe king then sent for Duanan Gacha Druid, the best magician he had,\nand he spoke to him as follows:–\"Much wealth have I expended on\nyou, Duanan Gacha Druid, to give schooling and learning and magic\nmystery to you, if these people get away from me today without care,\nwithout consideration or regard for me, without chance of overtaking\nthem, and without power to stop them.”",
        "“Well, I will stop them,” said the magician, “until the company you\nsend in pursuit return.” And the magician placed a wood before them\nthrough which no man could go, but the sons of Uisnech marched\nthrough the wood without halt or hesitation, and Deirdre held on to\nNaois’s hand.",
        "“What is the good of that? that will not do yet,” said Connachar.\n\"They are off without bending of their feet or stopping of their\nstep, without heed or respect to me, and I am without power to keep\nup to them or opportunity to turn them back this night.”",
        "“I will try another plan on them,” said the druid; and he placed\nbefore them a grey sea instead of a green plain. The three heroes\nstripped and tied their clothes behind their heads, and Naois placed\nDeirdre on the top of his shoulder.",
        "  They stretched their sides to the stream,\n    And sea and land were to them the same,\n  The rough grey ocean was the same\n    As meadow-land green and plain.",
        "“Though that be good, O Duanan, it will not make the heroes return,\"\nsaid Connachar; “they are gone without regard for me, and without\nhonour to me, and without power on my part to pursue them or to\nforce them to return this night.”",
        "“We shall try another method on them, since yon one did not stop\nthem,” said the druid. And the druid froze the grey ridged sea into\nhard rocky knobs, the sharpness of sword being on the one edge and\nthe poison power of adders on the other. Then Arden cried that he\nwas getting tired, and nearly giving over. “Come you, Arden, and sit\non my right shoulder,” said Naois. Arden came and sat, on Naois’s\nshoulder. Arden was long in this posture when he died; but though he\nwas dead Naois would not let him go. Allen then cried out that he\nwas getting faint and nigh-well giving up. When Naois heard his\nprayer, he gave forth the piercing sigh of death, and asked Allen to\nlay hold of him and he would bring him to land.",
        "Allen was not long when the weakness of death came on him and his\nhold failed. Naois looked around, and when he saw his two well-\nbeloved brothers dead, he cared not whether he lived or died, and he\ngave forth the bitter sigh of death, and his heart burst.",
        "“They are gone,” said Duanan Gacha Druid to the king, “and I have\ndone what you desired me. The sons of Uisnech are dead and they will\ntrouble you no more; and you have your wife hale and whole to\nyourself.”",
        "“Blessings for that upon you and may the good results accrue to me,\nDuanan. I count it no loss what I spent in the schooling and\nteaching of you. Now dry up the flood, and let me see if I can\nbehold Deirdre,” said Connachar. And Duanan Gacha Druid dried up the\nflood from the plain and the three sons of Uisnech were lying\ntogether dead, without breath of life, side by side on the green\nmeadow plain and Deirdre bending above showering down her tears.",
        "Then Deirdre said this lament: “Fair one, loved one, flower of\nbeauty; beloved upright and strong; beloved noble and modest\nwarrior. Fair one, blue-eyed, beloved of thy wife; lovely to me at\nthe trysting-place came thy clear voice through the woods of\nIreland. I cannot eat or smile henceforth. Break not to-day, my\nheart: soon enough shall I lie within my grave. Strong are the waves\nof sorrow, but stronger is sorrow’s self, Connachar.”",
        "The people then gathered round the heroes’ bodies and asked\nConnachar what was to be done with the bodies. The order that he\ngave was that they should dig a pit and put the three brothers in it\nside by side.",
        "Deirdre kept sitting on the brink of the grave, constantly asking\nthe gravediggers to dig the pit wide and free. When the bodies of\nthe brothers were put in the grave, Deirdre said:–",
        "  Come over hither, Naois, my love,\n  Let Arden close to Allen lie;\n  If the dead had any sense to feel,\n  Ye would have made a place for Deirdre.",
        "The men did as she told them. She jumped into the grave and lay down\nby Naois, and she was dead by his side.",
        "The king ordered the body to be raised from out the grave and to be\nburied on the other side of the loch. It was done as the king bade,\nand the pit closed. Thereupon a fir shoot grew out of the grave of\nDeirdre and a fir shoot from the grave of Naois, and the two shoots\nunited in a knot above the loch. The king ordered the shoots to be\ncut down, and this was done twice, until, at the third time, the\nwife whom the king had married caused him to stop this work of evil\nand his vengeance on the remains of the dead.",
        "There once lived a Munachar and a Manachar, a long time ago, and it\nis a long time since it was, and if they were alive now they would\nnot be alive then. They went out together to pick raspberries, and\nas many as Munachar used to pick Manachar used to eat. Munachar said\nhe must go look for a rod to make a gad to hang Manachar, who ate\nhis raspberries every one; and he came to the rod. “What news the\nday?” said the rod. “It is my own news that I’m seeking. Going\nlooking for a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who\nate my raspberries every one.”",
        "“You will not get me,” said the rod, “until you get an axe to cut\nme.” He came to the axe. “What news to-day?” said the axe. “It’s my\nown news I’m seeking. Going looking for an axe, an axe to cut a rod,\na rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries\nevery one.”",
        "“You will not get me,” said the axe, “until you get a flag to edge\nme.” He came to the flag. “What news today?” says the flag. “It’s my\nown news I’m seeking. Going looking for a flag, flag to edge axe,\naxe to cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who\nate my raspberries every one.”",
        "“You will not get me,” says the flag, “till you get water to wet\nme.” He came to the water. “What news to-day?” says the water. “It’s\nmy own news that I’m seeking. Going looking for water, water to wet\nflag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad\nto hang Manachar, who ate my raspberries every one.”",
        "“You will not get me,” said the water, “until you get a deer who\nwill swim me.” He came to the deer. “What news to-day?” says the\ndeer. “It’s my own news I’m seeking. Going looking for a deer, deer\nto swim water, water to wet flag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut a\nrod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my\nraspberries every one.”",
        "“You will not get me,” said the deer, “until you get a hound who\nwill hunt me.” He came to the hound. “What news to-day?” says the\nhound. “It’s my own news I’m seeking. Going looking for a hound,\nhound to hunt deer, deer to swim water, water to wet flag, flag to\nedge axe, axe to cut a rod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang\nManachar, who ate my raspberries every one.”",
        "“You will not get me,” said the hound, “until you get a bit of\nbutter to put in my claw.” He came to the butter. “What news to-\nday?” says the butter. “It’s my own news I’m seeking. Going looking\nfor butter, butter to go in claw of hound, hound to hunt deer, deer\nto swim water, water to wet flag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut a\nrod, a rod to make a gad, a gad to hang Manachar, who ate my\nraspberries every one.”",
        "“You will not get me,” said the butter, “until you get a cat who\nshall scrape me.” He came to the cat. “What news to-day?” said the\ncat. “It’s my own news I’m seeking. Going looking for a cat, cat to\nscrape butter, butter to go in claw of hound, hound to hunt deer,\ndeer to swim water, water to wet flag, flag to edge axe, axe to cut\na rod, a rod to make a gad, gad to hang Manachar, who ate my\nraspberries every one.”",
        "“You will not get me,” said the cat, “until you will get milk which\nyou will give me.” He came to the cow. “What news to-day?” said the\ncow. “It’s my own news I’m seeking.

        "“You will not get any milk from me,” said the cow, “until you bring\nme a whisp of straw from those threshers yonder.” He came to the\nthreshers. “What news to-day?” said the threshers. “It’s my own news\nI’m seeking.

        "“You will not get any whisp of straw from us,” said the threshers,\n\"until you bring us the makings of a cake from the miller over\nyonder.” He came to the miller. “What news to-day?” said the miller.\n\"It’s my own news I’m seeking.

        "He took the sieve in his hand and went over to the river, but as\noften as ever he would stoop and fill it with water, the moment he\nraised it the water would run out of it again, and sure, if he had\nbeen there from that day till this, he never could have filled it. A\ncrow went flying by him, over his head. “Daub! daub!” said the crow.",
        "“My blessings on ye, then,” said Munachar, “but it’s the good advice\nyou have,” and he took the red clay and the daub that was by the\nbrink, and he rubbed it to the bottom of the sieve, until all the\nholes were filled, and then the sieve held the water, and he brought\nthe water to the miller, and the miller gave him the makings of a\ncake, and he gave the makings of the cake to the threshers, and the\nthreshers gave him a whisp of straw, and he gave the whisp of straw\nto the cow, and the cow gave him milk, the milk he gave to the cat,\nthe cat scraped the butter, the butter went into the claw of the\nhound, the hound hunted the deer, the deer swam the water, the water\nwet the flag, the flag sharpened the axe, the axe cut the rod, and\nthe rod made a gad, and when he had it ready to hang Manachar he\nfound that Manachar had BURST.",
        "Once upon a time there was a king who had a wife, whose name was\nSilver-tree, and a daughter, whose name was Gold-tree. On a certain\nday of the days, Gold-tree and Silver-tree went to a glen, where\nthere was a well, and in it there was a trout.",
        "Said Silver-tree, “Troutie, bonny little fellow, am not I the most\nbeautiful queen in the world?”",

        "“Troutie, bonny little fellow,” said she, “am not I the most\nbeautiful queen in the world?”",
        "“Oh! indeed you are not.”",
        "“Who then?”",
        "“Why, Gold-tree, your daughter.”",
        "“Oh! well, she is not alive. It is a year since I put the poisoned\nstab into her finger.”",
        "“Oh! indeed she is not dead at all, at all.”",
        "Silver-tree, went home, and begged the king to put the long-ship in\norder, for that she was going to see her dear Gold-tree, as it was\nso long since she saw her. The long-ship was put in order, and they\nwent away. It was Silver-tree herself that was at the helm, and she\nsteered the ship so well that they were not long at all before they\narrived.",
        "The prince was out hunting on the hills. Gold-tree knew her father’s\nship coming.",
        "“Oh!” said she, “my mother is coming, and she will kill me.”",
        "“Not at all,” said the second wife; “we will go down to meet her.”",
        "Silver-tree came ashore. “Come down, Gold-tree, love,” said she,\n\"for your own mother has come to you with a precious drink.”",
        "“It is a custom in this country,” said the second wife, “that the\nperson who offers a drink takes a draught out of it first.”",
        "Silver-tree put her mouth to it, and the second wife went and struck\nit so that some of it went down her throat, and she fell dead. They\nhad only to carry her home a dead corpse and bury her.",
        "The prince and his two wives were long alive after this, pleased and\npeaceful.",
        "I left them there.",
        "Och, I thought all the world, far and near, had heerd o’ King\nO’Toole–well, well, but the darkness of mankind is untellible!\nWell, sir, you must know, as you didn’t hear it afore, that there\nwas a king, called King O’Toole, who was a fine old king in the old\nancient times, long ago; and it was he that owned the churches in\nthe early days. The king, you see, was the right sort; he was the\nreal boy, and loved sport as he loved his life, and hunting in\nparticular; and from the rising o’ the sun, up he got, and away he\nwent over the mountains after the deer; and fine times they were.",
        "Well, it was all mighty good, as long as the king had his health;\nbut, you see, in course of time the king grew old, by raison he was\nstiff in his limbs, and when he got stricken in years, his heart\nfailed him, and he was lost entirely for want o’ diversion, because\nhe couldn’t go a-hunting no longer; and, by dad, the poor king was\nobliged at last to get a goose to divert him. Oh, you may laugh, if\nyou like, but it’s truth I’m telling you; and the way the goose\ndiverted him was this-a-way: You see, the goose used to swim across\nthe lake, and go diving for trout, and catch fish on a Friday for\nthe king, and flew every other day round about the lake, diverting\nthe poor king. All went on mighty well until, by dad, the goose got\nstricken in years like her master, and couldn’t divert him no\nlonger, and then it was that the poor king was lost entirely. The\nking was walkin’ one mornin’ by the edge of the lake, lamentin’ his\ncruel fate, and thinking of drowning himself, that could get no\ndiversion in life, when all of a sudden, turning round the corner,\nwho should he meet but a mighty decent young man coming up to him.",
        "“God save you,” says the king to the young man.",
        "“God save you kindly, King O’Toole,” says the young man.",
        "“True for you,” says the king. “I am King O’Toole,” says he, “prince\nand plennypennytinchery of these parts,” says he; “but how came ye\nto know that?” says he.",
        "“Oh, never mind,” says St. Kavin.",
        "You see it was Saint Kavin, sure enough–the saint himself in\ndisguise, and nobody else. “Oh, never mind,” says he, “I know more\nthan that. May I make bold to ask how is your goose, King O’Toole?\"\nsays he.",
        "“Blur-an-agers, how came ye to know about my goose?” says the king.",
        "“Oh, no matter; I was given to understand it,” says Saint Kavin.",
        "After some more talk the king says, “What are you?”",
        "“I’m an honest man,” says Saint Kavin.",
        "“Well, honest man,” says the king, “and how is it you make your\nmoney so aisy?”",
        "“By makin’ old things as good as new,” says Saint Kavin.",
        "“Is it a tinker you are?” says the king.",
        "“No,” says the saint; “I’m no tinker by trade, King O’Toole; I’ve a\nbetter trade than a tinker,” says he–\"what would you say,” says he,\n\"if I made your old goose as good as new?”",
        "My dear, at the word of making his goose as good as new, you’d think\nthe poor old king’s eyes were ready to jump out of his head. With\nthat the king whistled, and down came the poor goose, just like a\nhound, waddling up to the poor cripple, her master, and as like him\nas two peas. The minute the saint clapt his eyes on the goose, “I’ll\ndo the job for you,” says he, “King O’Toole.”",
        "“By Jaminee!” says King O’Toole, “if you do, I’ll say you’re\nthe cleverest fellow in the seven parishes.”",
        "“Oh, by dad,” says St. Kavin, “you must say more nor that–my horn’s\nnot so soft all out,” says he, “as to repair your old goose for\nnothing; what’ll you gi’ me if I do the job for you?–that’s the\nchat,” says St. Kavin.",
        "“I’ll give you whatever you ask,” says the king; “isn’t that fair?”",
        "“Divil a fairer,” says the saint; “that’s the way to do business.\nNow,” says he, “this is the bargain I’ll make with you, King\nO’Toole: will you gi’ me all the ground the goose flies over, the\nfirst offer, after I make her as good as new?”",
        "“I will,” says the king.",
        "“You won’t go back o’ your word?” says St. Kavin.",
        "“Honour bright!” says King O’Toole, holding out his fist.",
        "“Honour bright!” says St. Kavin, back agin, “it’s a bargain. Come\nhere!” says he to the poor old goose–\"come here, you unfortunate\nould cripple, and it’s I that’ll make you the sporting bird.” With\nthat, my dear, he took up the goose by the two wings–\"Criss o’ my\ncross an you,” says he, markin’ her to grace with the blessed sign\nat the same minute–and throwing her up in the air, “whew,” says he,\njist givin’ her a blast to help her; and with that, my jewel, she\ntook to her heels, flyin’ like one o’ the eagles themselves, and\ncutting as many capers as a swallow before a shower of rain.",
        "Well, my dear, it was a beautiful sight to see the king standing\nwith his mouth open, looking at his poor old goose flying as light\nas a lark, and better than ever she was: and when she lit at his\nfeet, patted her on the head, and “Ma vourneen,” says he,\n\"but you are the darlint o’ the world.”",
        "“And what do you say to me,” says ’Saint Kavin, “for making her the\nlike?”",
        "“By Jabers,” says the king, “I say nothing beats the art o’ man,\nbarring the bees.”",
        "“And do you say no more nor that?” says Saint Kavin.",
        "“And that I’m beholden to you,” says the king.",
        "“But will you gi’e me all the ground the goose flew over?” says\nSaint Kavin.",
        "“I will,” says King O’Toole, “and you’re welcome to it,” says he,\n\"though it’s the last acre I have to give.”",
        "“But you’ll keep your word true?” says the saint.",
        "“As true as the sun,” says the king.",
        "“It’s well for you, King O’Toole, that you said that word,” says he;\n\"for if you didn’t say that word, the devil the bit o’ your goose\nwould ever fly agin.”",
        "When the king was as good as his word, Saint Kavin was pleased with\nhim, and then it was that he made himself known to the king. “And,\"\nsays he, “King O’Toole, you’re a decent man, for I only came here to\ntry you. You don’t know me,” says he, “because I’m disguised.”",
        "“Musha! then,” says the king, “who are you?”",
        "“I’m Saint Kavin,” said the saint, blessing himself.",
        "“Oh, queen of heaven!” says the king, making the sign of the cross\nbetween his eyes, and falling down on his knees before the saint;\n\"is it the great Saint Kavin,” says he, “that I’ve been discoursing\nall this time without knowing it,” says he, “all as one as if he was\na lump of a gossoon?–and so you’re a saint?” says the king.",
        "“I am,” says Saint Kavin.",
        "“By Jabers, I thought I was only talking to a dacent boy,” says the\nking.",
        "“Well, you know the difference now,” says the saint. “I’m Saint\nKavin,” says he, “the greatest of all the saints.”.",
        "And so the king had his goose as good as new, to divert him as long\nas he lived: and the saint supported him after he came into his\nproperty, as I told you, until the day of his death–and that was\nsoon after; for the poor goose thought he was catching a trout one\nFriday; but, my jewel, it was a mistake he made–and instead of a\ntrout, it was a thieving horse-eel; and instead of the goose killing\na trout for the king’s supper–by dad, the eel killed the king’s\ngoose–and small blame to him; but he didn’t ate her, because he\ndarn’t ate what Saint Kavin had laid his blessed hands on.",
        "Shortly after the birth of Kilhuch, the son of King Kilyth, his\nmother died. Before her death she charged the king that he should\nnot take a wife again until he saw a briar with two blossoms upon\nher grave, and the king sent every morning to see if anything were\ngrowing thereon. After many years the briar appeared, and he took to\nwife the widow of King Doged. She foretold to her stepson, Kilhuch,\nthat it was his destiny to marry a maiden named Olwen, or none\nother, and he, at his father’s bidding, went to the court of his\ncousin, King Arthur, to ask as a boon the hand of the maiden. He\nrode upon a grey steed with shell-formed hoofs, having a bridle of\nlinked gold, and a saddle also of gold. In his hand were two spears\nof silver, well-tempered, headed with steel, of an edge to wound the\nwind and cause blood to flow, and swifter than the fall of the dew-\ndrop from the blade of reed grass upon the earth when the dew of\nJune is at its heaviest. A gold-hilted sword was on his thigh, and\nthe blade was of gold, having inlaid upon it a cross of the hue of\nthe lightning of heaven. Two brindled, white-breasted greyhounds,\nwith strong collars of rubies, sported round him, and his courser\ncast up four sods with its four hoofs like four swallows about his\nhead. Upon the steed was a four-cornered cloth of purple, and an\napple of gold was at each corner. Precious gold was upon the\nstirrups and shoes, and the blade of grass bent not beneath them, so\nlight was the courser’s tread as he went towards the gate of King\nArthur’s palace.",
        "Arthur received him with great ceremony, and asked him to remain at\nthe palace; but the youth replied that he came not to consume meat\nand drink, but to ask a boon of the king.",
        "Then said Arthur, “Since thou wilt not remain here, chieftain, thou\nshalt receive the boon, whatsoever thy tongue may name, as far as\nthe wind dries and the rain moistens, and the sun revolves, and the\nsea encircles, and the earth extends, save only my ships and my\nmantle, my sword, my lance, my shield, my dagger, and Guinevere my\nwife.”",
        "So Kilhuch craved of him the hand of Olwen, the daughter of\nYspathaden Penkawr, and also asked the favour and aid of all\nArthur’s court.",
        "Then said Arthur, “O chieftain, I have never heard of the maiden of\nwhom thou speakest, nor of her kindred, but I will gladly send\nmessengers in search of her.”",
        "And the youth said, “I will willingly grant from this night to that\nat the end of the year to do so.”",
        "Then Arthur sent messengers to every land within his dominions to\nseek for the maiden; and at the end of the year Arthur’s messengers\nreturned without having gained any knowledge or information\nconcerning Olwen more than on the first day.",
        "Then said Kilhuch, “Every one has received his boon, and I yet lack\nmine. I will depart and bear away thy honour with me.”",
        "Then said Kay, “Rash chieftain! dost thou reproach Arthur? Go with\nus, and we will not part until thou dost either confess that the\nmaiden exists not in the world, or until we obtain her.”",
        "Thereupon Kay rose up.",
        "Kay had this peculiarity, that his breath lasted nine nights and\nnine days under water, and he could exist nine nights and nine days\nwithout sleep. A wound from Kay’s sword no physician could heal.\nVery subtle was Kay. When it pleased him he could render himself as\ntall as the highest tree in the forest. And he had another\npeculiarity–so great was the heat of his nature, that, when it\nrained hardest, whatever he carried remained dry for a handbreadth\nabove and a handbreadth below his hand; and when his companions were\ncoldest, it was to them as fuel with which to light their fire.",
        "And Arthur called Bedwyr, who never shrank from any enterprise upon\nwhich Kay was bound. None was equal to him in swiftness throughout\nthis island except Arthur and Drych Ail Kibthar. And although he was\none-handed, three warriors could not shed blood faster than he on\nthe field of battle. Another property he had; his lance would\nproduce a wound equal to those of nine opposing lances.",
        "And Arthur called to Kynthelig the guide. “Go thou upon this\nexpedition with the Chieftain.” For as good a guide was he in a land\nwhich he had never seen as he was in his own.",
        "He called Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, because he knew all tongues.",
        "He called Gwalchmai, the son of Gwyar, because he never returned\nhome without achieving the adventure of which he went in quest. He\nwas the best of footmen and the best of knights. He was nephew to\nArthur, the son of his sister, and his cousin.",
        "And Arthur called Menw, the son of Teirgwaeth, in order that if they\nwent into a savage country, he might cast a charm and an illusion\nover them, so that none might see them whilst they could see every\none.",
        "They journeyed on till they came to a vast open plain, wherein they\nsaw a great castle, which was the fairest in the world. But so far\naway was it that at night it seemed no nearer, and they scarcely\nreached it on the third day. When they came before the castle they\nbeheld a vast flock of sheep, boundless and without end. They told\ntheir errand to the herdsman, who endeavoured to dissuade them,\nsince none who had come thither on that quest had returned alive.\nThey gave to him a gold ring, which he conveyed to his wife, telling\nher who the visitors were.",
        "On the approach of the latter, she ran out with joy to greet them,\nand sought to throw her arms about their necks. But Kay, snatching a\nbillet out of the pile, placed the log between her two hands, and\nshe squeezed it so that it became a twisted coil.",
        "“O woman,” said Kay, “if thou hadst squeezed me thus, none could\never again have set their affections on me. Evil love were this.”",
        "They entered the house, and after meat she told them that the maiden\nOlwen came there every Saturday to wash. They pledged their faith\nthat they would not harm her, and a message was sent to her. So\nOlwen came, clothed in a robe of flame-coloured silk, and with a\ncollar of ruddy gold, in which were emeralds and rubies, about her\nneck. More golden was her hair than the flower of the broom, and her\nskin was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands\nand her fingers than the blossoms of the wood anemone amidst the\nspray of the meadow fountain. Brighter were her glances than those\nof a falcon; her bosom was more snowy than the breast of the white\nswan, her cheek redder than the reddest roses. Whoso beheld was\nfilled with her love. Four white trefoils sprang up wherever she\ntrod, and therefore was she called Olwen.",
        "Then Kilhuch, sitting beside her on a bench, told her his love, and\nshe said that he would win her as his bride if he granted whatever\nher father asked.",
        "Accordingly they went up to the castle and laid their request before\nhim.",
        "“Raise up the forks beneath my two eyebrows which have fallen over\nmy eyes,” said Yspathaden Penkawr, “that I may see the fashion of my\nson-in-law.”",
        "They did so, and he promised, them an answer on the morrow. But as\nthey were going forth, Yspathaden seized one of the three poisoned\ndarts that lay beside him and threw it back after them.",
        "And Bedwyr caught it and flung it back, wounding Yspathaden in the\nknee.",
        "Then said he, “A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly. I shall ever\nwalk the worse for his rudeness. This poisoned iron pains me like\nthe bite of a gad-fly. Cursed be the smith who forged it, and the\nanvil whereon it was wrought.”",
        "The knights rested in the house of Custennin the herdsman, but the\nnext day at dawn they returned to the castle and renewed their\nrequest.",
        "Yspathaden said it was necessary that he should consult Olwen’s four\ngreat-grandmothers and her four great-grand-sires.",
        "The knights again withdrew, and as they were going he took the\nsecond dart and cast it after them.",
        "But Menw caught it and flung it back, piercing Yspathaden’s breast\nwith it, so that it came out at the small of his back.",
        "“A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly,” says he, “the hard iron pains\nme like the bite of a horse-leech. Cursed be the hearth whereon it\nwas heated! Henceforth whenever I go up a hill, I shall have a scant\nin my breath and a pain in my chest.”",
        "On the third day the knights returned once more to the palace, and\nYspathaden took the third dart and cast it at them.",
        "But Kilhuch caught it and threw it vigorously, and wounded him\nthrough the eyeball, so that the dart came out at the back of his\nhead.",
        "“A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly. As long as I remain alive my\neyesight will be the worse. Whenever I go against the wind my eyes\nwill water, and peradventure my head will burn, and I shall have a\ngiddiness every new moon. Cursed be the fire in which it was forged.\nLike the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron.”",
        "And they went to meat.",
        "Said Yspathaden Penkawr, “Is it thou that seekest my daughter?”",
        "“It is I,” answered Kilhuch.",
        "“I must have thy pledge that thou wilt not do towards me otherwise\nthan is just, and when I have gotten that which I shall name, my\ndaughter thou shalt have.”",
        "“I promise thee that willingly,” said Kilhuch, “name what thou\nwilt.”",
        "“I will do so,” said he.",
        "“Throughout the world there is not a comb or scissors with which I\ncan arrange my hair, on, account of its rankness, except the comb\nand scissors that are between the two ears of Turch Truith, the son\nof Prince Tared. He will not give them of his own free will, and\nthou wilt not be able to compel him.”",
        "“It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think\nthat it will not be easy.”",
        "“Though thou get this, there is yet that which thou wilt not get. It\nwill not be possible to hunt Turch Truith without Drudwyn the whelp\nof Greid, the son of Eri, and know that throughout the world there\nis not a huntsman who can hunt with this dog, except Mabon the son\nof Modron. He was taken from his mother when three nights old, and\nit is not known where he now is, nor whether he is living or dead.”",
        "“It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think\nthat it will not be easy.”",
        "“Though thou get this, there is yet that which thou wilt not get.\nThou wilt not get Mabon, for it is not known where he is, unless\nthou find Eidoel, his kinsman in blood, the son of Aer. For it would\nbe useless to seek for him. He is his cousin.”",
        "“It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think\nthat it will not be easy. Horses shall I have, and chivalry; and my\nlord and kinsman Arthur will obtain for me all these things. And I\nshall gain thy daughter, and thou shalt lose thy life.”",
        "“Go forward. And thou shalt not be chargeable for food or raiment\nfor my daughter while thou art seeking these things; and when thou\nhast compassed all these marvels, thou shalt have my daughter for\nwife.”",
        "Now, when they told Arthur how they had sped, Arthur said, “Which of\nthese marvels will it be best for us to seek first?”",
        "“It will be best,” said they, “to seek Mabon the son of Modron; and\nhe will not be found unless we first find Eidoel, the son of Aer,\nhis kinsman.”",
        "Then Arthur rose up, and the warriors of the Islands of Britain with\nhim, to seek for Eidoel; and they proceeded until they came before\nthe castle of Glivi, where Eidoel was imprisoned.",
        "Glivi stood on the summit of his castle, and said, “Arthur, what\nrequirest thou of me, since nothing remains to me in this fortress,\nand I have neither joy nor pleasure in it; neither wheat nor oats?”",
        "Said Arthur, “Not to injure thee came I hither, but to seek for the\nprisoner that is with thee.”",
        "“I will give thee my prisoner, though I had not thought to give him\nup to any one; and therewith shalt thou have my support and my aid.”",
        "His followers then said unto Arthur, “Lord, go thou home, thou canst\nnot proceed with thy host in quest of such small adventures as\nthese.”",
        "Then said Arthur, “It were well for thee, Gwrhyr Gwalstawt\nIeithoedd, to go upon this quest, for thou knowest all languages,\nand art familiar with those of the birds and the beasts. Go, Eidoel,\nlikewise with my men in search of thy cousin. And as for you, Kay\nand Bedwyr, I have hope of whatever adventure ye are in quest of,\nthat ye will achieve it. Achieve ye this adventure for me.”",
        "These went forward until they came to the Ousel of Cilgwri, and\nGwrhyr adjured her for the sake of Heaven, saying, “Tell me if thou\nknowest aught of Mabon, the son of Modron, who was taken when three\nnights old from between his mother and the wall.”",
        "And the Ousel answered, “When I first came here there was a smith’s\nanvil in this place, and I was then a young bird, and from that time\nno work has been done upon it, save the pecking of my beak every\nevening, and now there is not so much as the size of a nut remaining\nthereof; yet the vengeance of Heaven be upon me if during all that\ntime I have ever heard of the man for whom you inquire.\nNevertheless, there is a race of animals who were formed before me,\nand I will be your guide to them.”",
        "So they proceeded to the place where was the Stag of Redynvre.",
        "“Stag of Redynvre, behold we are come to thee, an embassy from\nArthur, for we have not heard of any animal older than thou. Say,\nknowest thou aught of Mabon?”",
        "The stag said, “When first I came hither there was a plain all\naround me, without any trees save one oak sapling, which grew up to\nbe an oak with an hundred branches. And that oak has since perished,\nso that now nothing remains of it but the withered stump; and from\nthat day to this I have been here, yet have I never heard of the man\nfor whom you inquire. Nevertheless, I will be your guide to the\nplace where there is an animal which was formed before I was.”",
        "So they proceeded to the place where was the Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd, to\ninquire of him concerning Mabon.",
        "And the owl said, “If I knew I would tell you. When first I came\nhither, the wide valley you see was a wooded glen. And a race of men\ncame and rooted it up. And there grew there a second wood, and this\nwood is the third. My wings, are they not withered stumps? Yet all\nthis time, even until to-day, I have never heard of the man for whom\nyou inquire. Nevertheless, I will be the guide of Arthur’s embassy\nuntil you come to the place where is the oldest animal in this\nworld, and the one who has travelled most, the eagle of Gwern Abwy.”",
        "When they came to the eagle, Gwrhyr asked it the same question; but\nit replied, “I have been here for a great space of time, and when I\nfirst came hither there was a rock here, from the top of which I\npecked at the stars every evening, and now it is not so much as a\nspan high. From that day to this I have been here, and I have never\nheard of the man for whom you inquire, except once when I went in\nsearch of food as far as Llyn Llyw.  And when I came there, I struck\nmy talons into a salmon, thinking he would serve me as food for a\nlong time. But he drew me into the deep, and I was scarcely able to\nescape from him. After that I went with my whole kindred to attack\nhim and to try to destroy him, but he sent messengers and made peace\nwith me, and came and besought me to take fifty fish-spears out of\nhis back. Unless he know something of him whom you seek, I cannot\ntell you who may. However, I will guide you to the place where he\nis.”",
        "So they went thither, and the eagle said, “Salmon of Llyn Llyw, I\nhave come to thee with an embassy from Arthur to ask thee if thou\nknowest aught concerning Mabon, the son of Modron, who was taken\naway at three nights old from between his mother and the wall.”",
        "And the salmon answered, “As much as I know I will tell thee. With\nevery tide I go along the river upwards, until I come near to the\nwalls of Gloucester, and there have I found such wrong as I never\nfound elsewhere; and to the end that ye may give credence thereto,\nlet one of you go thither upon each of my two shoulders.”",
        "So Kay and Gwrhyr went upon his shoulders, and they proceeded till\nthey came to the wall of the prison, and they heard a great wailing\nand lamenting from the dungeon. Said Gwrhyr, “Who is it that laments\nin this house of stone?”",
        "And the voice replied, “Alas, it is Mabon, the son of Modron, who is\nhere imprisoned!”",
        "Then they returned and told Arthur, who, summoning his warriors,\nattacked the castle.",
        "And whilst the fight was going on, Kay and Bedwyr, mounting on the\nshoulders of the fish, broke into the dungeon, and brought away with\nthem Mabon, the son of Modron.",
        "Then Arthur summoned unto him all the warriors that were in the\nthree islands of Britain and in the three islands adjacent; and he\nwent as far as Esgeir Ocrvel in Ireland where the Boar Truith was\nwith his seven young pigs. And the dogs were let loose upon him from\nall sides. But he wasted the fifth part of Ireland, and then set\nforth through the sea to Wales. Arthur and his hosts, and his\nhorses, and his dogs followed hard after him. But ever and awhile\nthe boar made a stand, and many a champion of Arthur’s did he slay.\nThroughout all Wales did Arthur follow him, and one by one the\nyoung pigs were killed. At length, when he would fain have crossed\nthe Severn and escaped into Cornwall, Mabon the son of Modron came\nup with him, and Arthur fell upon him together with the champions of\nBritain. On the one side Mabon the son of Modron spurred his steed\nand snatched his razor from him, whilst Kay came up with him on the\nother side and took from him the scissors. But before they could\nobtain the comb he had regained the ground with his feet, and from\nthe moment that he reached the shore, neither dog nor man nor horse\ncould overtake him until he came to Cornwall. There Arthur and his\nhosts followed in his track until they overtook him in Cornwall.\nHard had been their trouble before, but it was child’s play to what\nthey met in seeking the comb. Win it they did, and the Boar Truith\nthey hunted into the deep sea, and it was never known whither he\nwent.",
        "Then Kilhuch set forward, and as many as wished ill to Yspathaden\nPenkawr. And they took the marvels with them to his court. And Kaw\nof North Britain came and shaved his beard, skin and flesh clean off\nto the very bone from ear to ear.",
        "“Art thou shaved, man?” said Kilhuch.",
        "“I am shaved,” answered he.",
        "“Is thy daughter mine now?”",
        "“She is thine, but therefore needst thou not thank me, but Arthur\nwho hath accomplished this for thee. By my free will thou shouldst\nnever have had her, for with her I lose my life.”",
        "Then Goreu the son of Custennin seized him by the hair of his head\nand dragged him after him to the keep, and cut off his head and\nplaced it on a stake on the citadel.",
        "Thereafter the hosts of Arthur dispersed themselves each man to his\nown country.",
        "Thus did Kilhuch son of Kelython win to wife Olwen, the daughter of\nYspathaden Penkawr.",
        "Once there was a poor widow, as often there has been, and she had\none son. A very scarce summer came, and they didn’t know how they’d\nlive till the new potatoes would be fit for eating. So Jack said to\nhis mother one evening, “Mother, bake my cake, and kill my hen, till\nI go seek my fortune; and if I meet it, never fear but I’ll soon be\nback to share it with you.”",
        "So she did as he asked her, and he set out at break of day on his\njourney. His mother came along with him to the yard gate, and says\nshe, “Jack, which would you rather have, half the cake and half the\nhen with my blessing, or the whole of ’em with my curse?”",
        "“O musha, mother,” says Jack, “why do you ax me that question? sure\nyou know I wouldn’t have your curse and Damer’s estate along with\nit.”",
        "“Well, then, Jack,” says she, “here’s the whole lot of ’em with my\nthousand blessings along with them.” So she stood on the yard fence\nand blessed him as far as her eyes could see him.",
        "Well, he went along and along till he was tired, and ne’er a\nfarmer’s house he went into wanted a boy. At last his road led by\nthe side of a bog, and there was a poor ass up to his shoulders near\na big bunch of grass he was striving to come at.",
        "“Ah, then, Jack asthore,” says he, “help me out or I’ll be drowned.”",
        "“Never say’t twice,” says Jack, and be pitched in big stones and\nsods into the slob, till the ass got good ground under him.",
        "“Thank you, Jack,” says he, when he was out on the hard road; “I’ll\ndo as much for you another time. Where are you going?”",
        "“Faith, I’m going to seek my fortune till harvest comes in, God\nbless it!”",
        "“And if you like,” says the ass, “I’ll go along with you; who knows\nwhat luck we may have!”",
        "“With all my heart, it’s getting late, let us be jogging.”",
        "Well, they were going through a village, and a whole army of\ngossoons were hunting a poor dog with a kettle tied to his tail. He\nran up to Jack for protection, and the ass let such a roar out of\nhim, that the little thieves took to their heels as if the ould boy\nwas after them.",
        "“More power to you, Jack,” says the dog.",
        "“I’m much obleeged to you: where is the baste and yourself going?”",
        "“We’re going to seek our fortune till harvest comes in.”",
        "“And wouldn’t I be proud to go with you!” says the dog, “and get rid\nof them ill conducted boys; purshuin’ to ’em.”",
        "“Well, well, throw your tail over your arm, and come along.”",
        "They got outside the town, and sat down under an old wall, and Jack\npulled out his bread and meat, and shared with the dog; and the ass\nmade his dinner on a bunch of thistles. While they were eating and\nchatting, what should come by but a poor half-starved cat, and the\nmoll-row he gave out of him would make your heart ache.",
        "“You look as if you saw the tops of nine houses since breakfast,\"\nsays Jack; “here’s a bone and something on it.”",
        "“May your child never know a hungry belly!” says Tom; “it’s myself\nthat’s in need of your kindness. May I be so bold as to ask where\nyez are all going?”",
        "“We’re going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in, and you\nmay join us if you like.”",
        "“And that I’ll do with a heart and a half,” says the cat, “and\nthank’ee for asking me.\"’",
        "Off they set again, and just as the shadows of the trees were three\ntimes as long as themselves, they heard a great cackling in a field\ninside the road, and out over the ditch jumped a fox with a fine\nblack cock in his mouth.",
        "“Oh, you anointed villain!” says the ass, roaring like thunder.",
        "“At him, good dog!” says Jack, and the word wasn’t out of his mouth\nwhen Coley was in full sweep after the Red Dog. Reynard dropped his\nprize like a hot potato, and was off like shot, and the poor cock\ncame back fluttering and trembling to Jack and his comrades.",
        "“O musha, naybours!” says he, “wasn’t it the height o’ luck that\nthrew you in my way! Maybe I won’t remember your kindness if ever I\nfind you in hardship; and where in the world are you all going?”",
        "“We’re going to seek our fortune till the harvest comes in; you may\njoin our party if you like, and sit on Neddy’s crupper when your\nlegs and wings are tired.”",
        "Well, the march began again, and just as the sun was gone down they\nlooked around, and there was neither cabin nor farm house in sight.",
        "“Well, well,” says Jack, “the worse luck now the better another\ntime, and it’s only a summer night after all. We’ll go into the\nwood, and make our bed on the long grass.”",
        "No sooner said than done. Jack stretched himself on a bunch of dry\ngrass, the ass lay near him, the dog and cat lay in the ass’s warm\nlap, and the cock went to roost in the next tree.",
        "Well, the soundness of deep sleep was over them all, when the cock\ntook a notion of crowing.",
        "“Bother you, Black Cock!” says the ass: “you disturbed me from as\nnice a wisp of hay as ever I tasted. What’s the matter?”",
        "“It’s daybreak that’s the matter: don’t you see light yonder?”",
        "“I see a light indeed,” says Jack, “but it’s from a candle it’s\ncoming, and not from the sun. As you’ve roused us we may as well go\nover, and ask for lodging.”",
        "So they all shook themselves, and went on through grass, and rocks,\nand briars, till they got down into a hollow, and there was the\nlight coming through the shadow, and along with it came singing, and\nlaughing, and cursing.",
        "“Easy, boys!” says Jack: “walk on your tippy toes till we see what\nsort of people we have to deal with.”",
        "So they crept near the window, and there they saw six robbers\ninside, with pistols, and blunderbushes, and cutlashes, sitting at a\ntable, eating roast beef and pork, and drinking mulled beer, and\nwine, and whisky punch.",
        "“Wasn’t that a fine haul we made at the Lord of Dunlavin’s!” says\none ugly-looking thief with his mouth full, “and it’s little we’d\nget only for the honest porter! here’s his purty health!”",
        "“The porter’s purty health!” cried out every one of them, and Jack\nbent his finger at his comrades.",
        "“Close your ranks, my men,” says he in a whisper, “and let every one\nmind the word of command.”",
        "So the ass put his fore-hoofs on the sill of the window, the dog got\non the ass’s head, the cat on the dog’s head, and the cock on the\ncat’s head. Then Jack made a sign, and they all sung out like mad.",
        "“Hee-haw, hee-haw!” roared the ass; “bow-wow!” barked the dog;\n\"meaw-meaw!” cried the cat; “cock-a-doodle-doo!” crowed the cock.",
        "“Level your pistols!” cried Jack, “and make smithereens of ’em.\nDon’t leave a mother’s son of ’em alive; present, fire!”  With that\nthey gave another halloo, and smashed every pane in the window. The\nrobbers were frightened out of their lives. They blew out the\ncandles, threw down the table, and skelped out at the back door as\nif they were in earnest, and never drew rein till they were in the\nvery heart of the wood.",
        "Jack and his party got into the room, closed the shutters, lighted\nthe candles, and ate and drank till hunger and thirst were gone.\nThen they lay down to rest;–Jack in the bed, the ass in the stable,\nthe dog on the door-mat, the cat by the fire, and the cock on the\nperch.",
        "At first the robbers were very glad to find themselves safe in the\nthick wood, but they soon began to get vexed.",
        "“This damp grass is very different from our warm room,” says one.",
        "“I was obliged to drop a fine pig’s foot,” says another.",
        "“I didn’t get a tayspoonful of my last tumbler,” says another.",
        "“And all the Lord of Dunlavin’s gold and silver that we left\nbehind!” says the last.",
        "“I think I’ll venture back,” says the captain, “and see if we can\nrecover anything.”",
        "“That’s a good boy!” said they all, and away he went.",
        "The lights were all out, and so he groped his way to the fire, and\nthere the cat flew in his face, and tore him with teeth and claws.\nHe let a roar out of him, and made for the room door, to look for a\ncandle inside. He trod on the dog’s tail, and if he did, he got the\nmarks of his teeth in his arms, and legs, and thighs.",
        "“Thousand murders!” cried he; “I wish I was out of this unlucky\nhouse.”",
        "When he got to the street door, the cock dropped down upon him with\nhis claws and bill, and what the cat and dog done to him was only a\nflay-bite to what he got from the cock.",
        "“Oh, tattheration to you all, you unfeeling vagabones!” says he,\nwhen he recovered his breath; and he staggered and spun round and\nround till he reeled into the stable, back foremost, but the ass\nreceived him with a kick on the broadest part of his small clothes,\nand laid him comfortably on the dunghill.",
        "When he came to himself, he scratched his head, and began to think\nwhat happened him; and as soon as he found that his legs were able\nto carry him, he crawled away, dragging one foot after another, till\nhe reached the wood.",
        "“Well, well,” cried them all, when he came within hearing, “any\nchance of our property?”",
        "“You may say chance,” says he, “and it’s itself is the poor chance\nall out. Ah, will any of you pull a bed of dry grass for me? All the\nsticking-plaster in Enniscorthy will be too little for the cuts and\nbruises I have on me. Ah, if you only knew what I have gone through\nfor you! When I got to the kitchen fire, looking for a sod of\nlighted turf, what should be there but an old woman carding flax,\nand you may see the marks she left on my face with the cards. I made\nto the room door as fast as I could, and who should I stumble over\nbut a cobbler and his seat, and if he did not work at me with his\nawls and his pinchers you may call me a rogue. Well, I got away from\nhim somehow, but when I was passing through the door, it must be the\ndivel himself that pounced down on me with his claws, and his teeth,\nthat were equal to sixpenny nails, and his wings–ill luck be in his\nroad! Well, at last I reached the stable, and there, by way of\nsalute, I got a pelt from a sledge-hammer that sent me half a mile\noff. If you don’t believe me, I’ll give you leave to go and judge\nfor yourselves.”",
        "“Oh, my poor captain,” says they, “we believe you to the nines.\nCatch us, indeed, going within a hen’s race of that unlucky cabin!”",
        "Well, before the sun shook his doublet next morning, Jack and his\ncomrades were up and about. They made a hearty breakfast on what was\nleft the night before, and then they all agreed to set off to the\ncastle of the Lord of Dunlavin, and give him back all his gold and\nsilver. Jack put it all in the two ends of a sack and laid it across\nNeddy’s back, and all took the road in their hands. Away they went,\nthrough bogs, up hills, down dales, and sometimes along the yellow\nhigh road, till they came to the hall-door of the Lord of Dunlavin,\nand who should be there, airing his powdered head, his white\nstockings, and his red breeches, but the thief of a porter.",
        "He gave a cross look to the visitors, and says he to Jack, “What do\nyou want here, my fine fellow? there isn’t room for you all.”",
        "“We want,” says Jack, “what I’m sure you haven’t to give us–and\nthat is, common civility.”",
        "“Come, be off, you lazy strollers!” says he, “while a cat ’ud be\nlicking her ear, or I’ll let the dogs at you.”",
        "“Would you tell a body,” says the cock that was perched on the ass’s\nhead, “who was it that opened the door for the robbers the other\nnight?”",
        "Ah! maybe the porter’s red face didn’t turn the colour of his frill,\nand the Lord of Dunlavin and his pretty daughter, that were standing\nat the parlour window unknownst to the porter, put out their heads.",
        "“I’d be glad, Barney,” says the master, “to hear your answer to the\ngentleman with the red comb on him.”",
        "“Ah, my lord, don’t believe the rascal; sure I didn’t open the door\nto the six robbers.”",
        "“And how did you know there were six, you poor innocent?” said the\nlord.",
        "“Never mind, sir,” says Jack, “all your gold and silver is there in\nthat sack, and I don’t think you will begrudge us our supper and bed\nafter our long march from the wood of Athsalach.”",
        "“Begrudge, indeed! Not one of you will ever see a poor day if I can\nhelp it.”",
        "So all were welcomed to their heart’s content, and the ass and the\ndog and the cock got the best posts in the farmyard, and the cat\ntook possession of the kitchen. The lord took Jack in hands, dressed\nhim from top to toe in broadcloth, and frills as white as snow, and\nturnpumps, and put a watch in his fob. When they sat down to dinner,\nthe lady of the house said Jack had the air of a born gentleman\nabout him, and the lord said he’d make him his steward. Jack brought\nhis mother, and settled her comfortably near the castle, and all\nwere as happy as you please.",
        "The Shee an Gannon was born in the morning, named at noon, and went\nin the evening to ask his daughter of the king of Erin.",
        "“I will give you my daughter in marriage,” said the king of Erin;\n\"you won’t get her, though, unless you go and bring me back the\ntidings that I want, and tell me what it is that put a stop to the\nlaughing of the Gruagach Gaire, who before this laughed always, and\nlaughed so loud that the whole world heard him. There are twelve\niron spikes out here in the garden behind my castle. On eleven of\nthe spikes are the heads of kings’ sons who came seeking my\ndaughter in marriage, and all of them went away to get the knowledge\nI wanted. Not one was able to get it and tell me what stopped the\nGruagach Gaire from laughing. I took the heads off them all when\nthey came back without the tidings for which they went, and I’m\ngreatly in dread that your head’ll be on the twelfth spike, for I’ll\ndo the same to you that I did to the eleven kings’ sons unless you\ntell what put a stop to the laughing of the Gruagach.”",
        "The Shee an Gannon made no answer, but left the king and pushed away\nto know could he find why the Gruagach was silent.",
        "He took a glen at a step, a hill at a leap, and travelled all day\ntill evening. Then he came to a house. The master of the house asked\nhim what sort was he, and he said: “A young man looking for hire.”",
        "“Well,” said the master of the house, “I was going tomorrow to look\nfor a man to mind my cows. If you’ll work for me, you’ll have a good\nplace, the best food a man could have to eat in this world, and a\nsoft bed to lie on.”",
        "The Shee an Gannon took service, and ate his supper. Then the master\nof the house said: “I am the Gruagach Gaire; now that you are my man\nand have eaten your supper, you’ll have a bed of silk to sleep on.”",
        "Next morning after breakfast the Gruagach said to the Shee an\nGannon: “Go out now and loosen my five golden cows and my bull\nwithout horns, and drive them to pasture; but when you have them out\non the grass, be careful you don’t let them go near the land of the\ngiant.”",
        "The new cowboy drove the cattle to pasture, and when near the land\nof the giant, he saw it was covered with woods and surrounded by a\nhigh wall. He went up, put his back against the wall, and threw in a\ngreat stretch of it; then he went inside and threw out another great\nstretch of the wall, and put the five golden cows and the bull\nwithout horns on the land of the giant.",
        "Then he climbed a tree, ate the sweet apples himself, and threw the\nsour ones down to the cattle of the Gruagach Gaire.",
        "Soon a great crashing was heard in the woods,–the noise of young\ntrees bending, and old trees breaking. The cowboy looked around and\nsaw a five-headed giant pushing through the trees; and soon he was\nbefore him.",
        "“Poor miserable creature!” said the giant; “but weren’t you impudent\nto come to my land and trouble me in this way? You’re too big for\none bite, and too small for two. I don’t know what to do but tear\nyou to pieces.”",
        "“You nasty brute,” said the cowboy, coming down to him from the\ntree, “’tis little I care for you;” and then they went at each\nother. So great was the noise between them that there was nothing in\nthe world but what was looking on and listening to the combat.",
        "They fought till late in the afternoon, when the giant was getting\nthe upper hand; and then the cowboy thought that if the giant should\nkill him, his father and mother would never find him or set eyes on\nhim again, and he would never get the daughter of the king of Erin.\nThe heart in his body grew strong at this thought. He sprang on the\ngiant, and with the first squeeze and thrust he put him to his knees\nin the hard ground, with the second thrust to his waist, and with\nthe third to his shoulders.",
        "“I have you at last; you’re done for now!”, said the cowboy. Then he\ntook out his knife, cut the five heads off the giant, and when he\nhad them off he cut out the tongues and threw the heads over the\nwall.",
        "Then he put the tongues in his pocket and drove home the cattle.\nThat evening the Gruagach couldn’t find vessels enough in all his\nplace to hold the milk of the five golden cows.",
        "But when the cowboy was on the way home with the cattle, the son of\nthe king of Tisean came and took the giant’s heads and claimed the\nprincess in marriage when the Gruagach Gaire should laugh.",
        "After supper the cowboy would give no talk to his master, but kept\nhis mind to himself, and went to the bed of silk to sleep.",
        "On the morning the cowboy rose before his master, and the first\nwords he said to the Gruagach were:",
        "“What keeps you from laughing, you who used to laugh so loud that\nthe whole world heard you?”",
        "“I’m sorry,” said the Gruagach, “that the daughter of the king of\nErin sent you here.”",
        "“If you don’t tell me of your own will, I’ll make you tell me,” said\nthe cowboy; and he put a face on himself that was terrible to look\nat, and running through the house like a madman, could find nothing\nthat would give pain enough to the Gruagach but some ropes made of\nuntanned sheepskin hanging on the wall.",
        "He took these down, caught the Gruagach, fastened him by the three\nsmalls, and tied him so that his little toes were whispering to his\nears. When he was in this state the Gruagach said: “I’ll tell you\nwhat stopped my laughing if you set me free.”",
        "So the cowboy unbound him, the two sat down together, and the\nGruagach said:–",
        "“I lived in this castle here with my twelve sons. We ate, drank,\nplayed cards, and enjoyed ourselves, till one day when my sons and I\nwere playing, a slender brown hare came rushing in, jumped on to the\nhearth, tossed up the ashes to the rafters and ran away.",
        "“On another day he came again; but if he did, we were ready for him,\nmy twelve sons and myself. As soon as he tossed up the ashes and ran\noff, we made after him, and followed him till nightfall, when he\nwent into a glen. We saw a light before us. I ran on, and came to a\nhouse with a great apartment, where there was a man named Yellow\nFace with twelve daughters, and the hare was tied to the side of the\nroom near the women.",
        "“There was a large pot over the fire in the room, and a great stork\nboiling in the pot. The man of the house said to me: ’There are\nbundles of rushes at the end of the room, go there and sit down with\nyour men!’",
        "“He went into the next room and brought out two pikes, one of wood,\nthe other of iron, and asked me which of the pikes would I take. I\nsaid, ’I’ll take the iron one;’ for I thought in my heart that if an\nattack should come on me, I could defend myself better with the iron\nthan the wooden pike.",
        "“Yellow Face gave me the iron pike, and the first chance of taking\nwhat I could out of the pot on the point of the pike. I got but a\nsmall piece of the stork, and the man of the house took all the rest\non his wooden pike. We had to fast that night; and when the man and\nhis twelve daughters ate the flesh of the stork, they hurled the\nbare bones in the faces of my sons and myself. We had to stop all\nnight that way, beaten on the faces by the bones of the stork.",
        "“Next morning, when we were going away, the man of the house asked\nme to stay a while; and going into the next room, he brought out\ntwelve loops of iron and one of wood, and said to me: ’Put the heads\nof your twelve sons into the iron loops, or your own head into the\nwooden one;’ and I said: ’I’ll put the twelve heads of my sons in\nthe iron loops, and keep my own out of the wooden one.’",
        "“He put the iron loops on the necks of my twelve sons, and put the\nwooden one on his own neck. Then he snapped the loops one after\nanother, till he took the heads off my twelve sons and threw the\nheads and bodies out of the house; but he did nothing to hurt his\nown neck.",
        "“When he had killed my sons he took hold of me and stripped the skin\nand flesh from the small of my back down, and when he had done that\nhe took the skin of a black sheep that had been hanging on the wall\nfor seven years and clapped it on my body in place of my own flesh\nand skin; and the sheepskin grew on me, and every year since then I\nshear myself, and every bit of wool I use for the stockings that I\nwear I clip off my own back.”",
        "When he had said this, the Gruagach showed the cowboy his back\ncovered with thick black wool.",
        "After what he had seen and heard, the cowboy said: “I know now why\nyou don’t laugh, and small blame to you. But does that hare come\nhere still?”",
        "“He does indeed,” said the Gruagach.",
        "Both went to the table to play, and they were not long playing cards\nwhen the hare ran in; and before they could stop him he was out\nagain.",
        "But the cowboy made after the hare, and the Gruagach after the\ncowboy, and they ran as fast as ever their legs could carry them\ntill nightfall; and when the hare was entering the castle where the\ntwelve sons of the Gruagach were killed, the cowboy caught him by\nthe two hind legs and dashed out his brains against the wall; and\nthe skull of the hare was knocked into the chief room of the castle,\nand fell at the feet of the master of the place.",
        "“Who has dared to interfere with my fighting pet?” screamed Yellow\nFace.",
        "“I,” said the cowboy; “and if your pet had had manners, he might be\nalive now.”",
        "The cowboy and the Gruagach stood by the fire. A stork was boiling\nin the pot, as when the Gruagach came the first time. The master of\nthe house went into the next room and brought out an iron and a\nwooden pike, and asked the cowboy which would he choose.",
        "“I’ll take the wooden one,” said the cowboy; “and you may keep the\niron one for yourself.”",
        "So he took the wooden one; and going to the pot, brought out on the\npike all the stork except a small bite, and he and the Gruagach fell\nto eating, and they were eating the flesh of the stork all night.\nThe cowboy and the Gruagach were at home in the place that time.",
        "In the morning the master of the house went into the next room, took\ndown the twelve iron loops with a wooden one, brought them out, and\nasked the cowboy which would he take, the twelve iron or the one\nwooden loop.",
        "“What could I do with the twelve iron ones for myself or my master?\nI’ll take the wooden one.”",
        "He put it on, and taking the twelve iron loops, put them on the\nnecks of the twelve daughters of the house, then snapped the twelve\nheads off them, and turning to their father, said: “I’ll do the same\nthing to you unless you bring the twelve sons of my master to life,\nand make them as well and strong as when you took their heads.”",
        "The master of the house went out and brought the twelve to life\nagain; and when the Gruagach saw all his sons alive and as well as\never, he let a laugh out of himself, and all the Eastern world heard\nthe laugh.",
        "Then the cowboy said to the Gruagach: “It’s a bad thing you have\ndone to me, for the daughter of the king of Erin will be married the\nday after your laugh is heard.”",
        "“Oh! then we must be there in time,” said the Gruagach; and they all\nmade away from the place as fast as ever they could, the cowboy, the\nGruagach, and his twelve sons.",
        "They hurried on; and when within three miles of the king’s castle\nthere was such a throng of people that no one could go a step ahead.\n\"We must clear a road through this,” said the cowboy.",
        "“We must indeed,” said the Gruagach; and at it they went, threw the\npeople some on one side and some on the other, and soon they had an\nopening for themselves to the king’s castle.",
        "As they went in, the daughter of the king of Erin and the son of the\nking of Tisean were on their knees just going to be married. The\ncowboy drew his hand on the bride-groom, and gave a blow that sent\nhim spinning till he stopped under a table at the other side of the\nroom.",
        "“What scoundrel struck that blow?” asked the king of Erin.",
        "“It was I,” said the cowboy.",
        "“What reason had you to strike the man who won my daughter?”",
        "“It was I who won your daughter, not he; and if you don’t believe\nme, the Gruagach Gaire is here himself. He’ll tell you the whole\nstory from beginning to end, and show you the tongues of the giant.”",
        "So the Gruagach came up and told the king the whole story, how the\nShee an Gannon had become his cowboy, had guarded the five golden\ncows and the bull without horns, cut off the heads of the five-\nheaded giant, killed the wizard hare, and brought his own twelve\nsons to life. “And then,” said the Gruagach, “he is the only man in\nthe whole world I have ever told why I stopped laughing, and the\nonly one who has ever seen my fleece of wool.”",
        "When the king of Erin heard what the Gruagach said, and saw the\ntongues of the giant fitted in the head, he made the Shee an Gannon\nkneel down by his daughter, and they were married on the spot.",
        "Then the son of the king of Tisean was thrown into prison, and the\nnext day they put down a great fire, and the deceiver was burned to\nashes.",
        "The wedding lasted nine days, and the last day was better than the\nfirst.",
        "At the time when the Tuatha De Dannan held the sovereignty of\nIreland, there reigned in Leinster a king, who was remarkably fond\nof hearing stories. Like the other princes and chieftains of the\nisland, he had a favourite story-teller, who held a large estate\nfrom his Majesty, on condition of telling him a new story every\nnight of his life, before he went to sleep. Many indeed were the\nstories he knew, so that he had already reached a good old age\nwithout failing even for a single night in his task; and such was\nthe skill he displayed that whatever cares of state or other\nannoyances might prey upon the monarch’s mind, his story-teller was\nsure to send him to sleep.",
        "One morning the story-teller arose early, and as his custom was,\nstrolled out into his garden turning over in his mind incidents\nwhich he might weave into a story for the king at night. But this\nmorning he found himself quite at fault; after pacing his whole\ndemesne, he returned to his house without being able to think of\nanything new or strange. He found no difficulty in “there was once a\nking who had three sons” or “one day the king of all Ireland,” but\nfurther than that he could not get. At length he went in to\nbreakfast, and found his wife much perplexed at his delay.",
        "“Why don’t you come to breakfast, my dear?” said she.",
        "“I have no mind to eat anything,” replied the story-teller; “long as\nI have been in the service of the king of Leinster, I never sat down\nto breakfast without having a new story ready for the evening, but\nthis morning my mind is quite shut up, and I don’t know what to do.\nI might as well lie down and die at once. I’ll be disgraced for ever\nthis evening, when the king calls for his story-teller.”",
        "Just at this moment the lady looked out of the window.",
        "“Do you see that black thing at the end of the field?” said she.",
        "“I do,” replied her husband.",
        "They drew nigh, and saw a miserable looking old man lying on the\nground with a wooden leg placed beside him.",
        "“Who are you, my good man?” asked the story-teller.",
        "“Oh, then, ’tis little matter who I am. I’m a poor, old, lame,\ndecrepit, miserable creature, sitting down here to rest awhile.”",
        "“An’ what are you doing with that box and dice I see in your hand?”",
        "“I am waiting here to see if any one will play a game with me,\"\nreplied the beggar man.",
        "“Play with you! Why what has a poor old man like you to play for?”",
        "“I have one hundred pieces of gold in this leathern purse,” replied\nthe old man.",
        "“You may as well play with him,” said the story-teller’s wife; “and\nperhaps you’ll have something to tell the king in the evening.”",
        "A smooth stone was placed between them, and upon it they cast their\nthrows.",
        "It was but a little while and the story-teller lost every penny of\nhis money.",
        "“Much good may it do you, friend,” said he. “What better hap could I\nlook for, fool that I am!”",
        "“Will you play again?” asked the old man.",
        "“Don’t be talking, man: you have all my money.”",
        "“Haven’t you chariot and horses and hounds?”",
        "“Well, what of them!”",
        "“I’ll stake all the money I have against thine.”",
        "“Nonsense, man! Do you think for all the money in Ireland, I’d run\nthe risk of seeing my lady tramp home on foot?”",
        "“Maybe you’d win,” said the bocough.",
        "“Maybe I wouldn’t,” said the story-teller.",
        "“Play with him, husband,” said his wife. “I don’t mind walking, if\nyou do, love.”",
        "“I never refused you before,” said the story-teller, “and I won’t do\nso now.”",
        "Down he sat again, and in one throw lost houses, hounds, and\nchariot.",
        "“Will you play again?” asked the beggar.",
        "“Are you making game of me, man; what else have I to stake?”",
        "“I’ll stake all my winnings against your wife,” said the old man.",
        "The story-teller turned away in silence, but his wife stopped him.",
        "“Accept his offer,” said she. “This is the third time, and who knows\nwhat luck you may have? You’ll surely win now.”",
        "They played again, and the story-teller lost. No sooner had he done\nso, than to his sorrow and surprise, his wife went and sat down near\nthe ugly old beggar.",
        "“Is that the way you’re leaving me?” said the story-teller.",
        "“Sure I was won,” said she. “You would not cheat the poor man, would\nyou?”",
        "“Have you any more to stake?” asked the old man.",
        "“You know very well I have not,” replied the story-teller.",
        "“I’ll stake the whole now, wife and all, against your own self,\"\nsaid the old man.",
        "Again they played, and again the story-teller lost.",
        "“Well! here I am, and what do you want with me?”",
        "“I’ll soon let you know,” said the old man, and he took from his\npocket a long cord and a wand.",
        "“Now,” said he to the story-teller, “what kind of animal would you\nrather be, a deer, a fox, or a hare? You have your choice now, but\nyou may not have it later.”",
        "To make a long story short, the story-teller made his choice of a\nhare; the old man threw the cord round him, struck him with the\nwand, and lo! a long-eared, frisking hare was skipping and jumping\non the green.",
        "But it wasn’t for long; who but his wife called the hounds, and set\nthem on him. The hare fled, the dogs followed. Round the field ran a\nhigh wall, so that run as he might, he couldn’t get out, and\nmightily diverted were beggar and lady to see him twist and double.",
        "In vain did he take refuge with his wife, she kicked him back again\nto the hounds, until at length the beggar stopped the hounds, and\nwith a stroke of the wand, panting and breathless, the story-teller\nstood before them again.",
        "“And how did you like the sport?” said the beggar.",
        "“It might be sport to others,” replied the story-teller looking at\nhis wife, “for my part I could well put up with the loss of it.”",
        "“Would it be asking too much,” he went on to the beggar, “to know\nwho you are at all, or where you come from, or why you take a\npleasure in plaguing a poor old man like me?”",
        "“Oh!” replied the stranger, “I’m an odd kind of good-for-little\nfellow, one day poor, another day rich, but if you wish to know more\nabout me or my habits, come with me and perhaps I may show you more\nthan you would make out if you went alone.”",
        "“I’m not my own master to go or stay,” said the story-teller, with a\nsigh.",
        "The stranger put one hand into his wallet and drew out of it before\ntheir eyes a well-looking middle-aged man, to whom he spoke as\nfollows:",
        "“By all you heard and saw since I put you into my wallet, take\ncharge of this lady and of the carriage and horses, and have them\nready for me whenever I want them.”",
        "Scarcely had he said these words when all vanished, and the story-\nteller found himself at the Foxes’ Ford, near the castle of Red Hugh\nO’Donnell. He could see all but none could see him.",
        "O’Donnell was in his hall, and heaviness of flesh and weariness of\nspirit were upon him.",
        "“Go out,” said he to his doorkeeper, “and see who or what may be\ncoming.”",
        "The doorkeeper went, and what he saw was a lank, grey beggarman;\nhalf his sword bared behind his haunch, his two shoes full of cold\nroad-a-wayish water sousing about him, the tips of his two ears out\nthrough his old hat, his two shoulders out through his scant\ntattered cloak, and in his hand a green wand of holly.",
        "“Save you, O’Donnell,” said the lank grey beggarman.",
        "“And you likewise,” said O’Donnell. “Whence come you, and what is\nyour craft?”",
        "  “I come from the outmost stream of earth,\n  From the glens where the white swans glide,\n  A night in Islay, a night in Man,\n  A night on the cold hillside.”",
        "“It’s the great traveller you are,” said O’Donnell.",
        "“Maybe you’ve learnt something on the road.”",
        "“I am a juggler,” said the lank grey beggarman, “and for five pieces\nof silver you shall see a trick of mine.”",
        "“You shall have them,” said O’Donnell; and the lank grey beggarman\ntook three small straws and placed them in his hand.",
        "“The middle one,” said he, “I’ll blow away; the other two I’ll\nleave.”",
        "“Thou canst not do it,” said one and all.",
        "But the lank grey beggarman put a finger on either outside straw\nand, whiff, away he blew the middle one.",
        "“’Tis a good trick,” said O’Donnell; and he paid him his five pieces\nof silver.",
        "“For half the money,” said one of the chief’s lads, “I’ll do the\nsame trick.”",
        "“Take him at his word, O’Donnell.”",
        "The lad put the three straws on his hand, and a finger on either\noutside straw and he blew; and what happened but that the fist was\nblown away with the straw.",
        "“Thou art sore, and thou wilt be sorer,” said O’Donnell.",
        "“Six more pieces, O’Donnell, and I’ll do another trick for thee,\"\nsaid the lank grey beggarman.",
        "“Six shalt thou have.”",
        "“Seest thou my two ears! One I’ll move but not t’other.”",
        "“’Tis easy to see them, they’re big enough, but thou canst never\nmove one ear and not the two together.”",
        "The lank grey beggarman put his hand to his ear, and he gave it a\npull.",
        "O’Donnell laughed and paid him the six pieces.",
        "“Call that a trick,” said the fistless lad, “any one can do that,\"\nand so saying, he put up his hand, pulled his ear, and what happened\nwas that he pulled away ear and head.",
        "“Sore thou art; and sorer thou’lt be,” said O’Donnell.",
        "“Well, O’Donnell,” said the lank grey beggarman, “strange are the\ntricks I’ve shown thee, but I’ll show thee a stranger one yet for\nthe same money.”",
        "“Thou hast my word for it,” said O’Donnell.",
        "With that the lank grey beggarman took a bag from under his armpit,\nand from out the bag a ball of silk, and he unwound the ball and he\nflung it slantwise up into the clear blue heavens, and it became a\nladder; then he took a hare and placed it upon the thread, and up it\nran; again he took out a red-eared hound, and it swiftly ran up\nafter the hare.",
        "“Now,” said the lank grey beggarman; “has any one a mind to run\nafter the dog and on the course?”",
        "“I will,” said a lad of O’Donnell’s.",
        "“Up with you then,” said the juggler; “but I warn you if you let my\nhare be killed I’ll cut off your head when you come down.”",
        "The lad ran up the thread and all three soon disappeared. After\nlooking up for a long time, the lank grey beggarman said: “I’m\nafraid the hound is eating the hare, and that our friend has fallen\nasleep.”",
        "Saying this he began to wind the thread, and down came the lad fast\nasleep; and down came the red-eared hound and in his mouth the last\nmorsel of the hare.",
        "He struck the lad a stroke with the edge of his sword, and so cast\nhis head off. As for the hound, if he used it no worse, he used it\nno better.",
        "“It’s little I’m pleased, and sore I’m angered,” said O’Donnell,\n\"that a hound and a lad should be killed at my court.”",
        "“Five pieces of silver twice over for each of them,” said the\njuggler, “and their heads shall be on them as before.”",
        "“Thou shalt get that,” said O’Donnell.",
        "Five pieces, and again five were paid him, and lo! the lad had his\nhead and the hound his. And though they lived to the uttermost end\nof time, the hound would never touch a hare again, and the lad took\ngood care to keep his eyes open.",
        "Scarcely had the lank grey beggarman done this when he vanished from\nout their sight, and no one present could say if he had flown\nthrough the air or if the earth had swallowed him up.",
        "  He moved as wave tumbling o’er wave\n  As whirlwind following whirlwind,\n  As a furious wintry blast,\n  So swiftly, sprucely, cheerily,\n  Right proudly,\n  And no stop made\n  Until he came\n  To the court of Leinster’s King,\n  He gave a cheery light leap\n  O’er top of turret,\n  Of court and city\n  Of Leinster’s King.",
        "Heavy was the flesh and weary the spirit of Leinster’s king. ’Twas\nthe hour he was wont to hear a story, but send he might right and\nleft, not a jot of tidings about the story-teller could he get.",
        "“Go to the door,” said he to his doorkeeper, “and see if a soul is\nin sight who may tell me something about my story-teller.”",
        "The doorkeeper went, and what he saw was a lank grey beggarman, half\nhis sword bared behind his haunch, his two old shoes full of cold\nroad-a-wayish water sousing about him, the tips of his two ears out\nthrough his old hat, his two shoulders out through his scant\ntattered cloak, and in his hand a three-stringed harp.",
        "“What canst thou do?” said the doorkeeper.",
        "“I can play,” said the lank grey beggarman.",
        "“Never fear,” added he to the story-teller, “thou shalt see all, and\nnot a man shall see thee.”",
        "When the king heard a harper was outside, he bade him in.",
        "“It is I that have the best harpers in the five-fifths of Ireland,\"\nsaid he, and he signed them to play. They did so, and if they\nplayed, the lank grey beggarman listened.",
        "“Heardst thou ever the like?” said the king.",
        "“Did you ever, O king, hear a cat purring over a bowl of broth, or\nthe buzzing of beetles in the twilight, or a shrill tongued old\nwoman scolding your head off?”",
        "“That I have often,” said the king.",
        "“More melodious to me,” said the lank grey beggarman, “were the\nworst of these sounds than the sweetest harping of thy harpers.”",
        "When the harpers heard this, they drew their swords and rushed at\nhim, but instead of striking him, their blows fell on each other,\nand soon not a man but was cracking his neighbour’s skull and\ngetting his own cracked in turn.",
        "When the king saw this, he thought it hard the harpers weren’t\ncontent with murdering their music, but must needs murder each\nother.",
        "“Hang the fellow who began it all,” said he; “and if I can’t have a\nstory, let me have peace.”",
        "Up came the guards, seized the lank grey beggarman, marched him to\nthe gallows and hanged him high and dry. Back they marched to the\nhall, and who should they see but the lank grey beggarman seated on\na bench with his mouth to a flagon of ale.",
        "“Never welcome you in,” cried the captain of the guard, “didn’t we\nhang you this minute, and what brings you here?”",
        "“Is it me myself, you mean?”",
        "“Who else?” said the captain.",
        "“May your hand turn into a pig’s foot with you when you think of\ntying the rope; why should you speak of hanging me?”",
        "Back they scurried to the gallows, and there hung the king’s\nfavourite brother.",
        "Back they hurried to the king who had fallen fast asleep.",
        "“Please your Majesty,” said the captain, “we hanged that strolling\nvagabond, but here he is back again as well as ever.”",
        "“Hang him again,” said the king, and off he went to sleep once more.",
        "They did as they were told, but what happened was that they found\nthe king’s chief harper hanging where the lank grey beggarman should\nhave been.",
        "The captain of the guard was sorely puzzled.",
        "“Are you wishful to hang me a third time?” said the lank grey\nbeggarman.",
        "“Go where you will,” said the captain, “and as fast as you please if\nyou’ll only go far enough. It’s trouble enough you’ve given us\nalready.”",
        "“Now you’re reasonable,” said the beggarman; “and since you’ve given\nup trying to hang a stranger because he finds fault with your music,\nI don’t mind telling you that if you go back to the gallows you’ll\nfind your friends sitting on the sward none the worse for what has\nhappened.”",
        "As he said these words he vanished; and the story-teller found\nhimself on the spot where they first met, and where his wife still\nwas with the carriage and horses.",
        "“Now,” said the lank grey beggarman, “I’ll torment you no longer.\nThere’s your carriage and your horses, and your money and your wife;\ndo what you please with them.”",
        "“For my carriage and my houses and my hounds,” said the story-\nteller, “I thank you; but my wife and my money you may keep.”",
        "“No,” said the other. “I want neither, and as for your wife, don’t\nthink ill of her for what she did, she couldn’t help it.”",
        "“Not help it! Not help kicking me into the mouth of my own hounds!\nNot help casting me off for the sake of a beggarly old–”",
        "“I’m not as beggarly or as old as ye think. I am Angus of the Bruff;\nmany a good turn you’ve done me with the King of Leinster. This\nmorning my magic told me the difficulty you were in, and I made up\nmy mind to get you out of it. As for your wife there, the power that\nchanged your body changed her mind. Forget and forgive as man and\nwife should do, and now you have a story for the King of Leinster\nwhen he calls for one;” and with that he disappeared.",
        "It’s true enough he now had a story fit for a king. From first to\nlast he told all that had befallen him; so long and loud laughed the\nking that he couldn’t go to sleep at all. And he told the story-\nteller never to trouble for fresh stories, but every night as long\nas be lived he listened again and he laughed afresh at the tale of\nthe lank grey beggarman.",
        "There was once a poor old fisherman, and one year he was not getting\nmuch fish. On a day of days, while he was fishing, there rose a sea-\nmaiden at the side of his boat, and she asked him, “Are you getting\nmuch fish?” The old man answered and said, “Not I.” “What reward\nwould you give me for sending plenty of fish to you?” “Ach!” said\nthe old man, “I have not much to spare.” “Will you give me the first\nson you have?” said she. “I would give ye that, were I to have a\nson,” said he. “Then go home, and remember me when your son is\ntwenty years of age, and you yourself will get plenty of fish after\nthis.” Everything happened as the sea-maiden said, and he himself\ngot plenty of fish; but when the end of the twenty years was\nnearing, the old man was growing more and more sorrowful and heavy\nhearted, while he counted each day as it came.",
        "He had rest neither day nor night. The son asked his father one day,\n\"Is any one troubling you?” The old man said, “Some one is, but\nthat’s nought to do with you nor any one else.” The lad said, “I\nmust know what it is.” His father told him at last how the matter\nwas with him and the sea-maiden. “Let not that put you in any\ntrouble,” said the son; “I will not oppose you.” “You shall not; you\nshall not go, my son, though I never get fish any more.” “If you\nwill not let me go with you, go to the smithy, and let the smith\nmake me a great strong sword, and I will go seek my fortune.”",
        "His father went to the smithy, and the smith made a doughty sword\nfor him. His father came home with the sword. The lad grasped it and\ngave it a shake or two, and it flew into a hundred splinters. He\nasked his father to go to the smithy and get him another sword in\nwhich there should be twice as much weight; and so his father did,\nand so likewise it happened to the next sword–it broke in two\nhalves. Back went the old man to the smithy; and the smith made a\ngreat sword, its like he never made before. “There’s thy sword for\nthee,” said the smith, “and the fist must be good that plays this\nblade.” The old man gave the sword to his son; he gave it a shake or\ntwo. “This will do,” said he; “it’s high time now to travel on my\nway.”",
        "On the next morning he put a saddle on a black horse that his father\nhad, and he took the world for his pillow. When he went on a bit, he\nfell in with the carcass of a sheep beside the road. And there were\na great black dog, a falcon, and an otter, and they were quarrelling\nover the spoil. So they asked him to divide it for them. He came\ndown off the horse, and he divided the carcass amongst the three.\nThree shares to the dog, two shares to the otter, and a share to the\nfalcon. “For this,” said the dog, “if swiftness of foot or sharpness\nof tooth will give thee aid, mind me, and I will be at thy side.\"\nSaid the otter, “If the swimming of foot on the ground of a pool\nwill loose thee, mind me, and I will be at thy side.” Said the\nfalcon, “If hardship comes on thee, where swiftness of wing or crook\nof a claw will do good, mind me, and I will be at thy side.”",
        "On this he went onward till he reached a king’s house, and he took\nservice to be a herd, and his wages were to be according to the milk\nof the cattle. He went away with the cattle, and the grazing was but\nbare. In the evening when he took them home they had not much milk,\nthe place was so bare, and his meat and drink was but spare that\nnight.",
        "On the next day he went on further with them; and at last he came to\na place exceedingly grassy, in a green glen, of which he never saw\nthe like.",
        "But about the time when he should drive the cattle homewards, who\nshould he see coming but a great giant with his sword in his hand?\n\"HI! HO!! HOGARACH!!!” says the giant. “Those cattle are mine; they\nare on my land, and a dead man art thou.” “I say not that,” says the\nherd; “there is no knowing, but that may be easier to say than to\ndo.”",
        "He drew the great clean-sweeping sword, and he neared the giant. The\nherd drew back his sword, and the head was off the giant in a\ntwinkling. He leaped on the black horse, and he went to look for the\ngiant’s house. In went the herd, and that’s the place where there\nwas money in plenty, and dresses of each kind in the wardrobe with\ngold and silver, and each thing finer than the other. At the mouth\nof night he took himself to the king’s house, but he took not a\nthing from the giant’s house. And when the cattle were milked this\nnight there was milk. He got good feeding this night, meat\nand drink without stint, and the king was hugely pleased that he had\ncaught such a herd. He went on for a time in this way, but at last\nthe glen grew bare of grass, and the grazing was not so good.",
        "So he thought he would go a little further forward in on the giant’s\nland; and he sees a great park of grass. He returned for the cattle,\nand he put them into the park.",
        "They were but a short time grazing in the park when a great wild\ngiant came full of rage and madness. “HI! HAW!! HOGARAICH!!!” said\nthe giant. “It is a drink of thy blood that will quench my thirst\nthis night.” “There is no knowing,” said the herd, “but that’s\neasier to say than to do.” And at each other went the men.\nThere was shaking of blades! At length and at last it seemed\nas if the giant would get the victory over the herd. Then he called\non the dog, and with one spring the black dog caught the giant by\nthe neck, and swiftly the herd struck off his head.",
        "He went home very tired this night, but it’s a wonder if the king’s\ncattle had not milk. The whole family was delighted that they had\ngot such a herd.",
        "Next day he betakes himself to the castle. When he reached the door,\na little flattering carlin met him standing in the door. “All hail\nand good luck to thee, fisher’s son; ’tis I myself am pleased to see\nthee; great is the honour for this kingdom, for thy like to be come\ninto it–thy coming in is fame for this little bothy; go in first;\nhonour to the gentles; go on, and take breath.”",
        "“In before me, thou crone; I like not flattery out of doors; go in\nand let’s hear thy speech.” In went the crone, and when her back was\nto him he drew his sword and whips her head off; but the sword flew\nout of his hand. And swift the crone gripped her head with both\nhands, and puts it on her neck as it was before. The dog sprung on\nthe crone, and she struck the generous dog with the club of magic;\nand there he lay. But the herd struggled for a hold of the club of\nmagic, and with one blow on the top of the head she was on earth in\nthe twinkling of an eye. He went forward, up a little, and there was\nspoil! Gold and silver, and each thing more precious than another,\nin the crone’s castle. He went back to the king’s house, and then\nthere was rejoicing.",
        "He followed herding in this way for a time; but one night after he\ncame home, instead of getting “All hail” and “Good luck” from the\ndairymaid, all were at crying and woe.",
        "He asked what cause of woe there was that night. The dairymaid said\n\"There is a great beast with three heads in the loch, and it must\nget some one every year, and the lot had come this year on the\nking’s daughter, and at midday to-morrow she is to meet the Laidly\nBeast at the upper end of the loch, but there is a great suitor\nyonder who is going to rescue her.”",
        "“What suitor is that?” said the herd. “Oh, he is a great General of\narms,” said the dairymaid, “and when he kills the beast, he will\nmarry the king’s daughter, for the king has said that he who could\nsave his daughter should get her to marry.”",
        "But on the morrow, when the time grew near, the king’s daughter and\nthis hero of arms went to give a meeting to the beast, and they\nreached the black rock, at the upper end of the loch. They were but\na short time there when the beast stirred in the midst of the loch;\nbut when the General saw this terror of a beast with three heads, he\ntook fright, and he slunk away, and he hid himself. And the king’s\ndaughter was under fear and under trembling, with no one at all to\nsave her. Suddenly she sees a doughty handsome youth, riding a black\nhorse, and coming where she was. He was marvellously arrayed and\nfull armed, and his black dog moved after him. “There is gloom on\nyour face, girl,” said the youth; “what do you here?”",
        "“Oh! that’s no matter,” said the king’s daughter. “It’s not long\nI’ll be here, at all events.”",
        "“I say not that,” said he.",
        "“A champion fled as likely as you, and not long since,” said she.",
        "“He is a champion who stands the war,” said the youth. And to meet\nthe beast he went with his sword and his dog. But there was a\nspluttering and a splashing between himself and the beast! The dog\nkept doing all he might, and the king’s daughter was palsied by fear\nof the noise of the beast! One of them would now be under, and now\nabove. But at last he cut one of the heads off it. It gave one roar,\nand the son of earth, echo of the rocks, called to its screech, and\nit drove the loch in spindrift from end to end, and in a twinkling\nit went out of sight.",
        "“Good luck and victory follow you, lad!” said the king’s daughter.\n\"I am safe for one night, but the beast will come again and again,\nuntil the other two heads come off it.” He caught the beast’s head,\nand he drew a knot through it, and he told her to bring it with her\nthere to-morrow. She gave him a gold ring, and went home with the\nhead on her shoulder, and the herd betook himself to the cows. But\nshe had not gone far when this great General saw her, and he said to\nher, “I will kill you if you do not say that ’twas I took the head\noff the beast.” “Oh!” says she, “’tis I will say it; who else took\nthe head off the beast but you!” They reached the king’s house, and\nthe head was on the General’s shoulder. But here was rejoicing, that\nshe should come home alive and whole, and this great captain with\nthe beast’s head full of blood in his hand. On the morrow they went\naway, and there was no question at all but that this hero would save\nthe king’s daughter.",
        "They reached the same place, and they were not long there when the\nfearful Laidly Beast stirred in the midst of the loch, and the hero\nslunk away as he did on yesterday, but it was not long after this\nwhen the man of the black horse came, with another dress on. No\nmatter; she knew that it was the very same lad. “It is I am pleased\nto see you,” said she. “I am in hopes you will handle your great\nsword to-day as you did yesterday. Come up and take breath.” But\nthey were not long there when they saw the beast steaming in the\nmidst of the loch.",
        "At once he went to meet the beast, but there was\nCloopersteich and Claperstich, spluttering, splashing, raving, and\nroaring on the beast! They kept at it thus for a long time, and\nabout the mouth of night he cut another head off the beast. He put\nit on the knot and gave it to her. She gave him one of her earrings,\nand he leaped on the black horse, and he betook himself to the\nherding. The king’s daughter went home with the heads. The General\nmet her, and took the heads from her, and he said to her, that she\nmust tell that it was he who took the head off the beast this time\nalso. “Who else took the head off the beast but you?” said she. They\nreached the king’s house with the heads. Then there was joy and\ngladness.",
        "About the same time on the morrow, the two went away. The officer\nhid himself as he usually did. The king’s daughter betook herself to\nthe bank of the loch. The hero of the black horse came, and if\nroaring and raving were on the beast on the days that were passed,\nthis day it was horrible. But no matter, he took the third head off\nthe beast, and drew it through the knot, and gave it to her. She\ngave him her other earring, and then she went home with the heads.\nWhen they reached the king’s house, all were full of smiles, and the\nGeneral was to marry the king’s daughter the next day. The wedding\nwas going on, and every one about the castle longing till the priest\nshould come. But when the priest came, she would marry only the one\nwho could take the heads off the knot without cutting it. “Who\nshould take the heads off the knot but the man that put the heads\non?” said the king.",
        "The General tried them; but he could not loose them; and at last\nthere was no one about the house but had tried to take the heads off\nthe knot, but they could not. The king asked if there were any one\nelse about the house that would try to take the heads off the knot.\nThey said that the herd had not tried them yet. Word went for the\nherd; and he was not long throwing them hither and thither. “But\nstop a bit, my lad,” said the king’s daughter; “the man that took\nthe heads off the beast, he has my ring and my two earrings.” The\nherd put his hand in his pocket, and he threw them on the board.\n\"Thou art my man,” said the king’s daughter. The king was not so\npleased when he saw that it was a herd who was to marry his\ndaughter, but he ordered that he should be put in a better dress;\nbut his daughter spoke, and she said that he had a dress as fine as\nany that ever was in his castle; and thus it happened. The herd put\non the giant’s golden dress, and they married that same day.",
        "They were now married, and everything went on well. But one day, and\nit was the namesake of the day when his father had promised him to\nthe sea-maiden, they were sauntering by the side of the loch, and lo\nand behold! she came and took him away to the loch without leave or\nasking. The king’s daughter was now mournful, tearful, blind-\nsorrowful for her married man; she was always with her eye on the\nloch. An old soothsayer met her, and she told how it had befallen\nher married mate. Then he told her the thing to do to save her mate,\nand that she did.",
        "She took her harp to the sea-shore, and sat and played; and the sea-\nmaiden came up to listen, for sea-maidens are fonder of music than\nall other creatures. But when the wife saw the sea-maiden she\nstopped. The sea-maiden said, “Play on!” but the princess said, “No,\nnot till I see my man again.” So the sea-maiden put up his head out\nof the loch. Then the princess played again, and stopped till the\nsea-maiden put him up to the waist. Then the princess played and\nstopped again, and this time the sea-maiden put him all out of the\nloch, and he called on the falcon and became one and flew on shore.\nBut the sea-maiden took the princess, his wife.",
        "Sorrowful was each one that was in the town on this night. Her man\nwas mournful, tearful, wandering down and up about the banks of the\nloch, by day and night. The old soothsayer met him. The soothsayer\ntold him that there was no way of killing the sea-maiden but the one\nway, and this is it–\"In the island that is in the midst of the loch\nis the white-footed hind of the slenderest legs and the swiftest\nstep, and though she be caught, there will spring a hoodie out of\nher, and though the hoodie should be caught, there will spring a\ntrout out of her, but there is an egg in the mouth of the trout, and\nthe soul of the sea-maiden is in the egg, and if the egg breaks, she\nis dead.”",
        "Now, there was no way of getting to this island, for the sea-maiden\nwould sink each boat and raft that would go on the loch. He thought\nhe would try to leap the strait with the black horse, and even so he\ndid. The black horse leaped the strait. He saw the hind, and he let\nthe black dog after her, but when he was on one side of the island,\nthe hind would be on the other side. “Oh! would the black dog of the\ncarcass of flesh were here!” No sooner spoke he the word than the\ngrateful dog was at his side; and after the hind he went, and they\nwere not long in bringing her to earth. But he no sooner caught her\nthan a hoodie sprang out of her. “Would that the falcon grey, of\nsharpest eye and swiftest wing, were here!” No sooner said he this\nthan the falcon was after the hoodie, and she was not long putting\nher to earth; and as the hoodie fell on the bank of the loch, out of\nher jumps the trout. “Oh! that thou wert by me now, oh otter!” No\nsooner said than the otter was at his side, and out on the loch she\nleaped, and brings the trout from the midst of the loch; but no\nsooner was the otter on shore with the trout than the egg came from\nhis mouth. He sprang and he put his foot on it. ’Twas then the sea-\nmaiden appeared, and she said, “Break not the egg, and you shall get\nall you ask.” “Deliver to me my wife!” In the wink of an eye she was\nby his side. When he got hold of her hand in both his hands, he let\nhis foot down on the egg, and the sea-maiden died.",
        "What Irish man, woman, or child has not heard of our renowned\nHibernian Hercules, the great and glorious Fin M’Coul? Not one, from\nCape Clear to the Giant’s Causeway, nor from that back again to Cape\nClear. And, by-the-way, speaking of the Giant’s Causeway brings me\nat once to the beginning of my story. Well, it so happened that Fin\nand his men were all working at the Causeway, in order to make a\nbridge across to Scotland; when Fin, who was very fond of his wife\nOonagh, took it into his head that he would go home and see how the\npoor woman got on in his absence. So, accordingly, he pulled up a\nfir-tree, and, after lopping off the roots and branches, made a\nwalking-stick of it, and set out on his way to Oonagh.",
        "Oonagh, or rather Fin, lived at this time on the very tip-top of\nKnockmany Hill, which faces a cousin of its own called Cullamore,\nthat rises up, half-hill, half-mountain, on the opposite side.",
        "There was at that time another giant, named Cucullin–some say he\nwas Irish, and some say he was Scotch–but whether Scotch or Irish,\nsorrow doubt of it but he was a targer. No other giant of the day\ncould stand before him; and such was his strength, that, when well\nvexed, he could give a stamp that shook the country about him. The\nfame and name of him went far and near; and nothing in the shape of\na man, it was said, had any chance with him in a fight. By one blow\nof his fists he flattened a thunderbolt and kept it in his pocket,\nin the shape of a pancake, to show to all his enemies, when they\nwere about to fight him. Undoubtedly he had given every giant in\nIreland a considerable beating, barring Fin M’Coul himself; and he\nswore that he would never rest, night or day, winter or summer, till\nhe would serve Fin with the same sauce, if he could catch him.\nHowever, the short and long of it was, with reverence be it spoken,\nthat Fin heard Cucullin was coming to the Causeway to have a trial\nof strength with him; and he was seized with a very warm and sudden\nfit of affection for his wife, poor woman, leading a very lonely,\nuncomfortable life of it in his absence. He accordingly pulled up\nthe fir-tree, as I said before, and having snedded it into a\nwalking-stick, set out on his travels to see his darling Oonagh on\nthe top of Knockmany, by the way.",
        "In truth, the people wondered very much why it was that Fin selected\nsuch a windy spot for his dwelling-house, and they even went so far\nas to tell him as much.",
        "“What can you mane, Mr. M’Coul,” said they, “by pitching your tent\nupon the top of Knockmany, where you never are without a breeze, day\nor night, winter or summer, and where you’re often forced to take\nyour nightcap without either going to bed or turning up your little\nfinger; ay, an’ where, besides this, there’s the sorrow’s own want\nof water?”",
        "“Why,” said Fin, “ever since I was the height of a round tower, I\nwas known to be fond of having a good prospect of my own; and where\nthe dickens, neighbours, could I find a better spot for a good\nprospect than the top of Knockmany? As for water, I am sinking a\npump, and, plase goodness, as soon as the Causeway’s made, I intend\nto finish it.”",
        "Now, this was more of Fin’s philosophy; for the real state of the\ncase was, that he pitched upon the top of Knockmany in order that he\nmight be able to see Cucullin coming towards the house. All we have\nto say is, that if he wanted a spot from which to keep a sharp look-\nout–and, between ourselves, he did want it grievously–barring\nSlieve Croob, or Slieve Donard, or its own cousin, Cullamore, he\ncould not find a neater or more convenient situation for it in the\nsweet and sagacious province of Ulster.",
        "“God save all here!” said Fin, good-humouredly, on putting his\nhonest face into his own door.",
        "“Musha, Fin, avick, an’ you’re welcome home to your own Oonagh, you\ndarlin’ bully.” Here followed a smack that is said to have made the\nwaters of the lake at the bottom of the hill curl, as it were, with\nkindness and sympathy.",
        "Fin spent two or three happy days with Oonagh, and felt himself very\ncomfortable, considering the dread he had of Cucullin. This,\nhowever, grew upon him so much that his wife could not but perceive\nsomething lay on his mind which he kept altogether to himself. Let a\nwoman alone, in the meantime, for ferreting or wheedling a secret\nout of her good man, when she wishes. Fin was a proof of this.",
        "“It’s this Cucullin,” said he, “that’s troubling me. When the fellow\ngets angry, and begins to stamp, he’ll shake you a whole townland;\nand it’s well known that he can stop a thunderbolt, for he always\ncarries one about him in the shape of a pancake, to show to any one\nthat might misdoubt it.”",
        "As he spoke, he clapped his thumb in his mouth, which he always did\nwhen he wanted to prophesy, or to know anything that happened in his\nabsence; and the wife asked him what he did it for.",
        "“He’s coming,” said Fin; “I see him below Dungannon.”",
        "“Thank goodness, dear! an’ who is it, avick? Glory be to God!”",
        "“That baste, Cucullin,” replied Fin; “and how to manage I don’t\nknow. If I run away, I am disgraced; and I know that sooner or later\nI must meet him, for my thumb tells me so.”",
        "“When will he be here?” said she.",
        "“To-morrow, about two o’clock,” replied Fin, with a groan.",
        "“Well, my bully, don’t be cast down,” said Oonagh; “depend on me,\nand maybe I’ll bring you better out of this scrape than ever you\ncould bring yourself, by your rule o’ thumb.”",
        "She then made a high smoke on the top of the hill, after which she\nput her finger in her mouth, and gave three whistles, and by that\nCucullin knew he was invited to Cullamore–for this was the way that\nthe Irish long ago gave a sign to all strangers and travellers, to\nlet them know they were welcome to come and take share of whatever\nwas going.",
        "In the meantime, Fin was very melancholy, and did not know what to\ndo, or how to act at all. Cucullin was an ugly customer to meet\nwith; and, the idea of the “cake” aforesaid flattened the very heart\nwithin him. What chance could he have, strong and brave though he\nwas, with a man who could, when put in a passion, walk the country\ninto earthquakes and knock thunderbolts into pancakes? Fin knew not\non what hand to turn him. Right or left–backward or forward–where\nto go he could form no guess whatsoever.",
        "“Oonagh,” said he, “can you do nothing for me? Where’s all your\ninvention? Am I to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes, and\nto have my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe, and\nme the best man among them? How am I to fight this man-mountain–\nthis huge cross between an earthquake and a thunderbolt?–with a\npancake in his pocket that was once–”",
        "“Be easy, Fin,” replied Oonagh; “troth, I’m ashamed of you. Keep\nyour toe in your pump, will you? Talking of pancakes, maybe, we’ll\ngive him as good as any he brings with him–thunderbolt or\notherwise. If I don’t treat him to as smart feeding as he’s got this\nmany a day, never trust Oonagh again. Leave him to me, and do just\nas I bid you.”",
        "This relieved Fin very much; for, after all, he had great confidence\nin his wife, knowing, as he did, that she had got him out of many a\nquandary before. Oonagh then drew the nine woollen threads of\ndifferent colours, which she always did to find out the best way of\nsucceeding in anything of importance she went about. She then\nplatted them into three plats with three colours in each, putting\none on her right arm, one round her heart, and the third round her\nright ankle, for then she knew that nothing could fail with her that\nshe undertook.",
        "Having everything now prepared, she sent round to the neighbours and\nborrowed one-and-twenty iron griddles, which she took and kneaded\ninto the hearts of one-and-twenty cakes of bread, and these she\nbaked on the fire in the usual way, setting them aside in the\ncupboard according as they were done. She then put down a large pot\nof new milk, which she made into curds and whey. Having done all\nthis, she sat down quite contented, waiting for his arrival on the\nnext day about two o’clock, that being the hour at which he was\nexpected–for Fin knew as much by the sucking of his thumb. Now this\nwas a curious property that Fin’s thumb had. In this very thing,\nmoreover, he was very much resembled by his great foe, Cucullin; for\nit was well known that the huge strength he possessed all lay in the\nmiddle finger of his right hand, and that, if he happened by any\nmischance to lose it, he was no more, for all his bulk, than a\ncommon man.",
        "At length, the next day, Cucullin was seen coming across the valley,\nand Oonagh knew that it was time to commence operations. She\nimmediately brought the cradle, and made Fin to lie down in it, and\ncover himself up with the clothes.",
        "“You must pass for your own child,” said she; “so just lie there\nsnug, and say nothing, but be guided by me.”",
        "About two o’clock, as he had been expected, Cucullin came in. “God\nsave all here!” said he; “is this where the great Fin M’Coul lives?”",
        "“Indeed it is, honest man,” replied Oonagh; “God save you kindly–\nwon’t you be sitting?”",
        "“Thank you, ma’am,” says he, sitting down; “you’re Mrs. M’Coul, I\nsuppose?”",
        "“I am,” said she; “and I have no reason, I hope, to be ashamed of my\nhusband.”",
        "“No,” said the other, “he has the name of being the strongest and\nbravest man in Ireland; but for all that, there’s a man not far from\nyou that’s very desirous of taking a shake with him. Is he at home?”",
        "“Why, then, no,” she replied; “and if ever a man left his house in a\nfury, he did. It appears that some one told him of a big basthoon of\na–giant called Cucullin being down at the Causeway to look for him,\nand so he set out there to try if he could catch him. Troth, I hope,\nfor the poor giant’s sake, he won’t meet with him, for if he does,\nFin will make paste of him at once.”",
        "“Well,” said the other, “I am Cucullin, and I have been seeking him\nthese twelve months, but he always kept clear of me; and I will\nnever rest night or day till I lay my hands on him.”",
        "At this Oonagh set up a loud laugh, of great contempt, by-the-way,\nand looked at him as if he was only a mere handful of a man.",
        "“Did you ever see Fin?” said she, changing her manner all at once.",
        "“How could I?” said he; “he always took care to keep his distance.”",
        "“I thought so,” she replied; “I judged as much; and if you take my\nadvice, you poor-looking creature, you’ll pray night and day that\nyou may never see him, for I tell you it will be a black day for you\nwhen you do. But, in the meantime, you perceive that the wind’s on\nthe door, and as Fin himself is from home, maybe you’d be civil\nenough to turn the house, for it’s always what Fin does when he’s\nhere.”",
        "This was a startler even to Cucullin; but he got up, however, and\nafter pulling the middle finger of his right hand until it cracked\nthree times, he went outside, and getting his arms about the house,\nturned it as she had wished. When Fin saw this, he felt the sweat of\nfear oozing out through every pore of his skin; but Oonagh,\ndepending upon her woman’s wit, felt not a whit daunted.",
        "“Arrah, then,” said she, “as you are so civil, maybe you’d do\nanother obliging turn for us, as Fin’s not here to do it himself.\nYou see, after this long stretch of dry weather we’ve had, we feel\nvery badly off for want of water. Now, Fin says there’s a fine\nspring-well somewhere under the rocks behind the hill here below,\nand it was his intention to pull them asunder; but having heard of\nyou, he left the place in such a fury, that he never thought of it.\nNow, if you try to find it, troth I’d feel it a kindness.”",
        "She then brought Cucullin down to see the place, which was then all\none solid rock; and, after looking at it for some time, he cracked\nhis right middle finger nine times, and, stooping down, tore a cleft\nabout four hundred feet deep, and a quarter of a mile in length,\nwhich has since been christened by the name of Lumford’s Glen.",
        "“You’ll now come in,” said she, “and eat a bit of such humble fare\nas we can give you. Fin, even although he and you are enemies, would\nscorn not to treat you kindly in his own house; and, indeed, if I\ndidn’t do it even in his absence, he would not be pleased with me.”",
        "She accordingly brought him in, and placing half-a-dozen of the\ncakes we spoke of before him, together with a can or two of butter,\na side of boiled bacon, and a stack of cabbage, she desired him to\nhelp himself–for this, be it known, was long before the invention\nof potatoes. Cucullin put one of the cakes in his mouth to take a\nhuge whack out of it, when he made a thundering noise, something\nbetween a growl and a yell. “Blood and fury!” he shouted; “how is\nthis? Here are two of my teeth out! What kind of bread this is you\ngave me.”",
        "“What’s the matter?” said Oonagh coolly.",
        "“Matter!” shouted the other again; “why, here are the two best teeth\nin my head gone.”",
        "“Why,” said she, “that’s Fin’s bread–the only bread he ever eats\nwhen at home; but, indeed, I forgot to tell you that nobody can eat\nit but himself, and that child in the cradle there. I thought,\nhowever, that, as you were reported to be rather a stout little\nfellow of your size, you might be able to manage it, and I did not\nwish to affront a man that thinks himself able to fight Fin. Here’s\nanother cake–maybe it’s not so hard as that.”",
        "Cucullin at the moment was not only hungry, but ravenous, so he\naccordingly made a fresh set at the second cake, and immediately\nanother yell was heard twice as loud as the first. “Thunder and\ngibbets!” he roared, “take your bread out of this, or I will not\nhave a tooth in my head; there’s another pair of them gone!”",
        "“Well, honest man,” replied Oonagh, “if you’re not able to eat the\nbread, say so quietly, and don’t be wakening the child in the cradle\nthere. There, now, he’s awake upon me.”",
        "Fin now gave a skirl that startled the giant, as coming from such a\nyoungster as he was supposed to be.",
        "“Mother,” said he, “I’m hungry-get me something to eat.” Oonagh went\nover, and putting into his hand a cake that had no griddle in it,\nFin, whose appetite in the meantime had been sharpened by seeing\neating going forward, soon swallowed it. Cucullin was thunderstruck,\nand secretly thanked his stars that he had the good fortune to miss\nmeeting Fin, for, as he said to himself, “I’d have no chance with a\nman who could eat such bread as that, which even his son that’s but\nin his cradle can munch before my eyes.”",
        "“I’d like to take a glimpse at the lad in the cradle,” said he to\nOonagh; “for I can tell you that the infant who can manage that\nnutriment is no joke to look at, or to feed of a scarce summer.”",
        "“With all the veins of my heart,” replied Oonagh; “get up, acushla,\nand show this decent little man something that won’t be unworthy of\nyour father, Fin M’Coul.”",
        "Fin, who was dressed for the occasion as much like a boy as\npossible, got up, and bringing Cucullin out, “Are you strong?” said\nhe.",
        "“Thunder an’ ounds!” exclaimed the other, “what a voice in so small\na chap!”",
        "“Are you strong?” said Fin again; “are you able to squeeze water out\nof that white stone?” he asked, putting one into Cucullin’s hand.\nThe latter squeezed and squeezed the stone, but in vain.",
        "“Ah, you’re a poor creature!” said Fin. “You a giant! Give me the\nstone here, and when I’ll show what Fin’s little son can do, you may\nthen judge of what my daddy himself is.”",
        "Fin then took the stone, and exchanging it for the curds, he\nsqueezed the latter until the whey, as clear as water, oozed out in\na little shower from his hand.",
        "“I’ll now go in,” said he, “to my cradle; for I scorn to lose my\ntime with any one that’s not able to eat my daddy’s bread, or\nsqueeze water out of a stone. Bedad, you had better be off out of\nthis before he comes back; for if he catches you, it’s in flummery\nhe’d have you in two minutes.”",
        "Cucullin, seeing what he had seen, was of the same opinion himself;\nhis knees knocked together with the terror of Fin’s return, and he\naccordingly hastened to bid Oonagh farewell, and to assure her, that\nfrom that day out, he never wished to hear of, much less to see, her\nhusband. “I admit fairly that I’m not a match for him,” said he,\n\"strong as I am; tell him I will avoid him as I would the plague,\nand that I will make myself scarce in this part of the country while\nI live.”",
        "Fin, in the meantime, had gone into the cradle, where he lay very\nquietly, his heart at his mouth with delight that Cucullin was about\nto take his departure, without discovering the tricks that had been\nplayed off on him.",
        "“It’s well for you,” said Oonagh, “that he doesn’t happen to be\nhere, for it’s nothing but hawk’s meat he’d make of you.”",
        "“I know that,” says Cucullin; “divil a thing else he’d make of me;\nbut before I go, will you let me feel what kind of teeth Fin’s lad\nhas got that can eat griddle-bread like that?”",
        "“With all pleasure in life,” said she; “only, as they’re far back in\nhis head, you must put your finger a good way in.”",
        "Cucullin was surprised to find such a powerful set of grinders in\none so young; but he was still much more so on finding, when he took\nhis hand from Fin’s mouth, that he had left the very finger upon\nwhich his whole strength depended, behind him. He gave one loud\ngroan, and fell down at once with terror and weakness. This was all\nFin wanted, who now knew that his most powerful and bitterest enemy\nwas at his mercy. He started out of the cradle, and in a few minutes\nthe great Cucullin, that was for such a length of time the terror of\nhim and all his followers, lay a corpse before him. Thus did Fin,\nthrough the wit and invention of Oonagh, his wife, succeed in\novercoming his enemy by cunning, which he never could have done by\nforce.",
        "King Hugh Curucha lived in Tir Conal, and he had three daughters,\nwhose names were Fair, Brown, and Trembling. Fair and Brown had new\ndresses, and went to church every Sunday. Trembling was kept at home\nto do the cooking and work. They would not let her go out of the\nhouse at all; for she was more beautiful than the other two, and\nthey were in dread she might marry before themselves.",
        "They carried on in this way for seven years. At the end of seven\nyears the son of the king of Emania fell in love with the eldest\nsister.",
        "One Sunday morning, after the other two had gone to church, the old\nhenwife came into the kitchen to Trembling, and said: “It’s at\nchurch you ought to be this day, instead of working here at home.”",
        "“How could I go?” said Trembling. “I have no clothes good enough to\nwear at church; and if my sisters were to see me there, they’d kill\nme for going out of the house.”",
        "“I’ll give you,” said the henwife, “a finer dress than either of\nthem has ever seen. And now tell me what dress will you have?”",
        "“I’ll have,” said Trembling, “a dress as white as snow, and green\nshoes for my feet.”",
        "Then the henwife put on the cloak of darkness, clipped a piece from\nthe old clothes the young woman had on, and asked for the whitest\nrobes in the world and the most beautiful that could be found, and a\npair of green shoes.",
        "That moment she had the robe and the shoes, and she brought them to\nTrembling, who put them on. When Trembling was dressed and ready,\nthe henwife said: “I have a honey-bird here to sit on your right\nshoulder, and a honey-finger to put on your left. At the door stands\na milk-white mare, with a golden saddle for you to sit on, and a\ngolden bridle to hold in your hand.”",
        "Trembling sat on the golden saddle; and when she was ready to start,\nthe henwife said: “You must not go inside the door of the church,\nand the minute the people rise up at the end of Mass, do you make\noff, and ride home as fast as the mare will carry you.”",
        "When Trembling came to the door of the church there was no one\ninside who could get a glimpse of her but was striving to know who\nshe was; and when they saw her hurrying away at the end of Mass,\nthey ran out to overtake her. But no use in their running; she was\naway before any man could come near her. From the minute she left\nthe church till she got home, she overtook the wind before her, and\noutstripped the wind behind.",
        "She came down at the door, went in, and found the henwife had dinner\nready. She put off the white robes, and had on her old dress in a\ntwinkling.",
        "When the two sisters came home the henwife asked: “Have you any news\nto-day from the church?”",
        "“We have great news,” said they. “We saw a wonderful grand lady at\nthe church-door. The like of the robes she had we have never seen on\nwoman before. It’s little that was thought of our dresses beside\nwhat she had on; and there wasn’t a man at the church, from the king\nto the beggar, but was trying to look at her and know who she was.”",
        "The sisters would give no peace till they had two dresses like the\nrobes of the strange lady; but honey-birds and honey-fingers were\nnot to be found.",
        "Next Sunday the two sisters went to church again, and left the\nyoungest at home to cook the dinner.",
        "After they had gone, the henwife came in and asked: “Will you go to\nchurch to-day?”",
        "“I would go,” said Trembling, “if I could get the going.”",
        "“What robe will you wear?” asked the henwife.",
        "“The finest black satin that can be found, and red shoes for my\nfeet.”",
        "“What colour do you want the mare to be?”",
        "“I want her to be so black and so glossy that I can see myself in\nher body.”",
        "The henwife put on the cloak of darkness, and asked for the robes\nand the mare. That moment she had them. When Trembling was dressed,\nthe henwife put the honey-bird on her right shoulder and the honey-\nfinger on her left. The saddle on the mare was silver, and so was\nthe bridle.",
        "When Trembling sat in the saddle and was going away, the henwife\nordered her strictly not to go inside the door of the church, but to\nrush away as soon as the people rose at the end of Mass, and hurry\nhome on the mare before any man could stop her.",
        "That Sunday, the people were more astonished than ever, and gazed at\nher more than the first time; and all they were thinking of was to\nknow who she was. But they had no chance; for the moment the people\nrose at the end of Mass she slipped from the church, was in the\nsilver saddle, and home before a man could stop her or talk to her.",
        "The henwife had the dinner ready. Trembling took off her satin robe,\nand had on her old clothes before her sisters got home.",
        "“What news have you to-day?” asked the henwife of the sisters when\nthey came from the church.",
        "“Oh, we saw the grand strange lady again! And it’s little that any\nman could think of our dresses after looking at the robes of satin\nthat she had on! And all at church, from high to low, had their\nmouths open, gazing at her, and no man was looking at us.”",
        "The two sisters gave neither rest nor peace till they got dresses as\nnearly like the strange lady’s robes as they could find. Of course\nthey were not so good; for the like of those robes could not be\nfound in Erin.",
        "When the third Sunday came, Fair and Brown went to church dressed in\nblack satin. They left Trembling at home to work in the kitchen, and\ntold her to be sure and have dinner ready when they came back.",
        "After they had gone and were out of sight, the henwife came to the\nkitchen and said: “Well, my dear, are you for church to-day?”",
        "“I would go if I had a new dress to wear.”",
        "“I’ll get you any dress you ask for. What dress would you like?\"\nasked the henwife.",
        "“A dress red as a rose from the waist down, and white as snow from\nthe waist up; a cape of green on my shoulders; and a hat on my head\nwith a red, a white, and a green feather in it; and shoes for my\nfeet with the toes red, the middle white, and the backs and heels\ngreen.”",
        "The henwife put on the cloak of darkness, wished for all these\nthings, and had them. When Trembling was dressed, the henwife put\nthe honey-bird on her right shoulder and the honey-finger on her\nleft, and, placing the hat on her head, clipped a few hairs from one\nlock and a few from another with her scissors, and that moment the\nmost beautiful golden hair was flowing down over the girl’s\nshoulders. Then the henwife asked what kind of a mare she would\nride. She said white, with blue and gold-coloured diamond-shaped\nspots all over her body, on her back a saddle of gold, and on her\nhead a golden bridle.",
        "The mare stood there before the door, and a bird sitting between her\nears, which began to sing as soon as Trembling was in the saddle,\nand never stopped till she came home from the church.",
        "The fame of the beautiful strange lady had gone out through the\nworld, and all the princes and great men that were in it came to\nchurch that Sunday, each one hoping that it was himself would have\nher home with him after Mass.",
        "The son of the king of Emania forgot all about the eldest sister,\nand remained outside the church, so as to catch the strange lady\nbefore she could hurry away.",
        "The church was more crowded than ever before, and there were three\ntimes as many outside. There was such a throng before the church\nthat Trembling could only come inside the gate.",
        "As soon as the people were rising at the end of Mass, the lady\nslipped out through the gate, was in the golden saddle in an\ninstant, and sweeping away ahead of the wind. But if she was, the\nprince of Emania was at her side, and, seizing her by the foot, he\nran with the mare for thirty perches, and never let go of the\nbeautiful lady till the shoe was pulled from her foot, and he was\nleft behind with it in his hand. She came home as fast as the mare\ncould carry her, and was thinking all the time that the henwife\nwould kill her for losing the shoe.",
        "Seeing her so vexed and so changed in the face, the old woman asked:\n\"What’s the trouble that’s on you now?” “Oh! I’ve lost one of the\nshoes off my feet,” said Trembling.",
        "“Don’t mind that; don’t be vexed,” said the henwife; “maybe it’s the\nbest thing that ever happened to you.”",
        "Then Trembling gave up all the things she had to the henwife, put on\nher old clothes, and went to work in the kitchen. When the sisters\ncame home, the henwife asked: “Have you any news from the church?”",
        "“We have indeed,” said they, “for we saw the grandest sight to-day.\nThe strange lady came again, in grander array than before. On\nherself and the horse she rode were the finest colours of the world,\nand between the ears of the horse was a bird which never stopped\nsinging from the time she came till she went away. The lady herself\nis the most beautiful woman ever seen by man in Erin.”",
        "After Trembling had disappeared from the church, the son of the king\nof Emania said to the other kings’ sons: “I will have that lady for\nmy own.”",
        "They all said: “You didn’t win her just by taking the shoe off her\nfoot; you’ll have to win her by the point of the sword; you’ll have\nto fight for her with us before you can call her your own.”",
        "“Well,” said the son of the king of Emania, “when I find the lady\nthat shoe will fit, I’ll fight for her, never fear, before I leave\nher to any of you.”",
        "Then all the kings’ sons were uneasy, and anxious to know who was\nshe that lost the shoe; and they began to travel all over Erin to\nknow could they find her. The prince of Emania and all the others\nwent in a great company together, and made the round of Erin; they\nwent everywhere,–north, south, east, and west. They visited every\nplace where a woman was to be found, and left not a house in the\nkingdom they did not search, to know could they find the woman the\nshoe would fit, not caring whether she was rich or poor, of high or\nlow degree.",
        "The prince of Emania always kept the shoe; and when the young women\nsaw it, they had great hopes, for it was of proper size, neither\nlarge nor small, and it would beat any man to know of what material\nit was made. One thought it would fit her if she cut a little from\nher great toe; and another, with too short a foot, put something in\nthe tip of her stocking. But no use; they only spoiled their feet,\nand were curing them for months afterwards.",
        "The two sisters, Fair and Brown, heard that the princes of the world\nwere looking all over Erin for the woman that could wear the shoe,\nand every day they were talking of trying it on; and one day\nTrembling spoke up and said: “Maybe it’s my foot that the shoe will\nfit.”",
        "“Oh, the breaking of the dog’s foot on you! Why say so when you were\nat home every Sunday?”",
        "They were that way waiting, and scolding the younger sister, till\nthe princes were near the place. The day they were to come, the\nsisters put Trembling in a closet, and locked the door on her. When\nthe company came to the house, the prince of Emania gave the shoe to\nthe sisters. But though they tried and tried, it would fit neither\nof them.",
        "“Is there any other young woman in the house?” asked the prince.",
        "“There is,” said Trembling, speaking up in the closet; “I’m here.”",
        "“Oh! we have her for nothing but to put out the ashes,” said the\nsisters.",
        "But the prince and the others wouldn’t leave the house till they had\nseen her; so the two sisters had to open the door. When Trembling\ncame out, the shoe was given to her, and it fitted exactly.",
        "The prince of Emania looked at her and said: “You are the woman the\nshoe fits, and you are the woman I took the shoe from.”",
        "Then Trembling spoke up, and said: “Do you stay here till I return.”",
        "Then she went to the henwife’s house. The old woman put on the cloak\nof darkness, got everything for her she had the first Sunday at\nchurch, and put her on the white mare in the same fashion. Then\nTrembling rode along the highway to the front of the house. All who\nsaw her the first time said: “This is the lady we saw at church.”",
        "Then she went away a second time, and a second time came back on the\nblack mare in the second dress which the henwife gave her. All who\nsaw her the second Sunday said: “That is the lady we saw at church.”",
        "A third time she asked for a short absence, and soon came back on\nthe third mare and in the third dress. All who saw her the third\ntime said: “That is the lady we saw at church.” Every man was\nsatisfied, and knew that she was the woman.",
        "Then all the princes and great men spoke up, and said to the son of\nthe king of Emania: “You’ll have to fight now for her before we let\nher go with you.”",
        "“I’m here before you, ready for combat,” answered the prince.",
        "Then the son of the king of Lochlin stepped forth. The struggle\nbegan, and a terrible struggle it was. They fought for nine hours;\nand then the son of the king of Lochlin stopped, gave up his claim,\nand left the field. Next day the son of the king of Spain fought six\nhours, and yielded his claim. On the third day the son of the king\nof Nyerfói fought eight hours, and stopped. The fourth day the son\nof the king of Greece fought six hours, and stopped. On the fifth\nday no more strange princes wanted to fight; and all the sons of\nkings in Erin said they would not fight with a man of their own\nland, that the strangers had had their chance, and, as no others\ncame to claim the woman, she belonged of right to the son of the\nking of Emania.",
        "The marriage-day was fixed, and the invitations were sent out. The\nwedding lasted for a year and a day. When the wedding was over, the\nking’s son brought home the bride, and when the time came a son was\nborn. The young woman sent for her eldest sister, Fair, to be with\nher and care for her. One day, when Trembling was well, and when her\nhusband was away hunting, the two sisters went out to walk; and when\nthey came to the seaside, the eldest pushed the youngest sister in.\nA great whale came and swallowed her.",
        "The eldest sister came home alone, and the husband asked, “Where is\nyour sister?”",
        "“She has gone home to her father in Ballyshannon; now that I am\nwell, I don’t need her.”",
        "“Well,” said the husband, looking at her, “I’m in dread it’s my wife\nthat has gone.”",
        "“Oh! no,” said she; “it’s my sister Fair that’s gone.”",
        "Since the sisters were very much alike, the prince was in doubt.\nThat night he put his sword between them, and said: “If you are my\nwife, this sword will get warm; if not, it will stay cold.”",
        "In the morning when he rose up, the sword was as cold as when he put\nit there.",
        "It happened, when the two sisters were walking by the seashore, that\na little cowboy was down by the water minding cattle, and saw Fair\npush Trembling into the sea; and next day, when the tide came in, he\nsaw the whale swim up and throw her out on the sand. When she was on\nthe sand she said to the cowboy: “When you go home in the evening\nwith the cows, tell the master that my sister Fair pushed me into\nthe sea yesterday; that a whale swallowed me, and then threw me out,\nbut will come again and swallow me with the coming of the next tide;\nthen he’ll go out with the tide, and come again with to-morrow’s\ntide, and throw me again on the strand. The whale will cast me out\nthree times. I’m under the enchantment of this whale, and cannot\nleave the beach or escape myself. Unless my husband saves me before\nI’m swallowed the fourth time, I shall be lost. He must come and\nshoot the whale with a silver bullet when he turns on the broad of\nhis back. Under the breast-fin of the whale is a reddish-brown spot.\nMy husband must hit him in that spot, for it is the only place in\nwhich he can be killed.”",
        "When the cowboy got home, the eldest sister gave him a draught of\noblivion, and he did not tell.",
        "Next day he went again to the sea. The whale came and cast Trembling\non shore again. She asked the boy “Did you tell the master what I\ntold you to tell him?”",
        "“I did not,” said he; “I forgot.”",
        "“How did you forget?” asked she.",
        "“The woman of the house gave me a drink that made me forget.”",
        "“Well, don’t forget telling him this night; and if she gives you a\ndrink, don’t take it from her.”",
        "As soon as the cowboy came home, the eldest sister offered him a\ndrink. He refused to take it till he had delivered his message and\ntold all to the master. The third day the prince went down with his\ngun and a silver bullet in it. He was not long down when the whale\ncame and threw Trembling upon the beach as the two days before. She\nhad no power to speak to her husband till he had killed the whale.\nThen the whale went out, turned over once on the broad of his back,\nand showed the spot for a moment only. That moment the prince fired.\nHe had but the one chance, and a short one at that; but he took it,\nand hit the spot, and the whale, mad with pain, made the sea all\naround red with blood, and died.",
        "That minute Trembling was able to speak, and went home with her\nhusband, who sent word to her father what the eldest sister had\ndone. The father came, and told him any death he chose to give her\nto give it. The prince told the father he would leave her life and\ndeath with himself. The father had her put out then on the sea in a\nbarrel, with provisions in it for seven years.",
        "In time Trembling had a second child, a daughter. The prince and she\nsent the cowboy to school, and trained him up as one of their own\nchildren, and said: “If the little girl that is born to us now\nlives, no other man in the world will get her but him.”",
        "The cowboy and the prince’s daughter lived on till they were\nmarried. The mother said to her husband “You could not have saved me\nfrom the whale but for the little cowboy; on that account I don’t\ngrudge him my daughter.”",
        "The son of the king of Emania and Trembling had fourteen children,\nand they lived happily till the two died of old age.",
        "A poor woman had three sons. The eldest and second eldest were\ncunning clever fellows, but they called the youngest Jack the Fool,\nbecause they thought he was no better than a simpleton. The eldest\ngot tired of staying at home, and said he’d go look for service. He\nstayed away a whole year, and then came back one day, dragging one\nfoot after the other, and a poor wizened face on him, and he as\ncross as two sticks. When he was rested and got something to eat, he\ntold them how he got service with the Gray Churl of the Townland of\nMischance, and that the agreement was, whoever would first say he\nwas sorry for his bargain, should get an inch wide of the skin of\nhis back, from shoulder to hips, taken off. If it was the master, he\nshould also pay double wages; if it was the servant, he should get\nno wages at all. “But the thief,” says he, “gave me so little to\neat, and kept me so hard at work, that flesh and blood couldn’t\nstand it; and when he asked me once, when I was in a passion, if I\nwas sorry for my bargain, I was mad enough to say I was, and here I\nam disabled for life.”",
        "Vexed enough were the poor mother and brothers; and the second\neldest said on the spot he’d go and take service with the Gray\nChurl, and punish him by all the annoyance he’d give him till he’d\nmake him say he was sorry for his agreement. “Oh, won’t I be glad to\nsee the skin coming off the old villain’s back!” said he. All they\ncould say had no effect: he started off for the Townland of\nMischance, and in a twelvemonth he was back just as miserable and\nhelpless as his brother.",
        "All the poor mother could say didn’t prevent Jack the Fool from\nstarting to see if he was able to regulate the Gray Churl. He agreed\nwith him for a year for twenty pounds, and the terms were the same.",
        "“Now, Jack,” said the Gray Churl, “if you refuse to do anything you\nare able to do, you must lose a month’s wages.”",
        "“I’m satisfied,” said Jack; “and if you stop me from doing a thing\nafter telling me to do it, you are to give me an additional month’s\nwages.”",
        "“I am satisfied,” says the master.",
        "“Or if you blame me for obeying your orders, you must give the\nsame.”",
        "“I am satisfied,” said the master again.",
        "The first day that Jack served he was fed very poorly, and was\nworked to the saddleskirts. Next day he came in just before the\ndinner was sent up to the parlour. They were taking the goose off\nthe spit, but well becomes Jack he whips a knife off the dresser,\nand cuts off one side of the breast, one leg and thigh, and one\nwing, and fell to. In came the master, and began to abuse him for\nhis assurance. “Oh, you know, master, you’re to feed me, and\nwherever the goose goes won’t have to be filled again till supper.\nAre you sorry for our agreement?”",
        "The master was going to cry out he was, but he bethought himself in\ntime. “Oh no, not at all,” said he.",
        "“That’s well,” said Jack.",
        "Next day Jack was to go clamp turf on the bog. They weren’t sorry to\nhave him away from the kitchen at dinner time. He didn’t find his\nbreakfast very heavy on his stomach; so he said to the mistress, “I\nthink, ma’am, it will be better for me to get my dinner now, and not\nlose time coming home from the bog.”",
        "“That’s true, Jack,” said she. So she brought out a good cake, and a\nprint of butter, and a bottle of milk, thinking he’d take them away\nto the bog. But Jack kept his seat, and never drew rein till bread,\nbutter, and milk went down the red lane.",
        "“Now, mistress,” said he, “I’ll be earlier at my work to-morrow if I\nsleep comfortably on the sheltery side of a pile of dry peat on dry\ngrass, and not be coming here and going back. So you may as well\ngive me my supper, and be done with the day’s trouble.” She gave him\nthat, thinking he’d take it to the bog; but he fell to on the spot,\nand did not leave a scrap to tell tales on him; and the mistress was\na little astonished.",
        "He called to speak to the master in the haggard, and said he, “What\nare servants asked to do in this country after aten their supper?”",
        "“Nothing at all, but to go to bed.”",
        "“Oh, very well, sir.” He went up on the stable-loft, stripped, and\nlay down, and some one that saw him told the master. He came up.",
        "“Jack, you anointed scoundrel, what do you mean?” “To go to sleep,\nmaster. The mistress, God bless her, is after giving me my\nbreakfast, dinner, and supper, and yourself told me that bed was the\nnext thing. Do you blame me, sir?”",
        "“Yes, you rascal, I do.”",
        "“Hand me out one pound thirteen and fourpence, if you please, sir.”",
        "“One divel and thirteen imps, you tinker! what for?”",
        "“Oh, I see, you’ve forgot your bargain. Are you sorry for it?”",
        "“Oh, ya–no, I mean. I’ll give you the money after your nap.”",
        "Next morning early, Jack asked how he’d be employed that day. “You\nare to be holding the plough in that fallow, outside the paddock.\"\nThe master went over about nine o’clock to see what kind of a\nploughman was Jack, and what did he see but the little boy driving\nthe bastes, and the sock and coulter of the plough skimming along\nthe sod, and Jack pulling ding-dong again’ the horses.",
        "“What are you doing, you contrary thief?” said the master.",
        "“An’ ain’t I strivin’ to hold this divel of a plough, as you told\nme; but that ounkrawn of a boy keeps whipping on the bastes in spite\nof all I say; will you speak to him?”",
        "“No, but I’ll speak to you. Didn’t you know, you bosthoon, that when\nI said ’holding the plough,’ I meant reddening the ground.”",
        "“Faith, an’ if you did, I wish you had said so. Do you blame me for\nwhat I have done?”",
        "The master caught himself in time, but he was so stomached, he said\nnothing.",
        "“Go on and redden the ground now, you knave, as other ploughmen do.”",
        "“An’ are you sorry for our agreement?”",
        "“Oh, not at all, not at all!”",
        "Jack, ploughed away like a good workman all the rest of the day.",
        "In a day or two the master bade him go and mind the cows in a field\nthat had half of it under young corn. “Be sure, particularly,” said\nhe, “to keep Browney from the wheat; while she’s out of mischief\nthere’s no fear of the rest.”",
        "About noon, he went to see how Jack was doing his duty, and what did\nhe find but Jack asleep with his face to the sod, Browney grazing\nnear a thorn-tree, one end of a long rope round her horns, and the\nother end round the tree, and the rest of the beasts all trampling\nand eating the green wheat. Down came the switch on Jack.",
        "“Jack, you vagabone, do you see what the cows are at?”",
        "“And do you blame, master?”",
        "“To be sure, you lazy sluggard, I do?”",
        "“Hand me out one pound thirteen and fourpence, master. You said if I\nonly kept Browney out of mischief, the rest would do no harm. There\nshe is as harmless as a lamb. Are you sorry for hiring me, master?”",
        "“To be–that is, not at all. I’ll give you your money when you go to\ndinner. Now, understand me; don’t let a cow go out of the field nor\ninto the wheat the rest of the day.”",
        "“Never fear, master!” and neither did he. But the churl would rather\nthan a great deal he had not hired him.",
        "The next day three heifers were missing, and the master bade Jack go\nin search of them.",
        "“Where will I look for them?” said Jack.",
        "“Oh, every place likely and unlikely for them all to be in.”",
        "The churl was getting very exact in his words. When he was coming\ninto the bawn at dinner-time, what work did he find Jack at but\npulling armfuls of the thatch off the roof, and peeping into the\nholes he was making?",
        "“What are you doing there, you rascal?”",
        "“Sure, I’m looking for the heifers, poor things!”",
        "“What would bring them there?”",
        "“I don’t think anything could bring them in it; but I looked first\ninto the likely places, that is, the cow-houses, and the pastures,\nand the fields next ’em, and now I’m looking in the unlikeliest\nplace I can think of. Maybe it’s not pleasing to you it is.”",
        "“And to be sure it isn’t pleasing to me, you aggravating goose-cap!”",
        "“Please, sir, hand me one pound thirteen and four pence before you\nsit down to your dinner. I’m afraid it’s sorrow that’s on you for\nhiring me at all.”",
        "“May the div–oh no; I’m not sorry. Will you begin, if you please,\nand put in the thatch again, just as if you were doing it for your\nmother’s cabin?”",
        "“Oh, faith I will, sir, with a heart and a half;” and by the time\nthe farmer came out from his dinner, Jack had the roof better than\nit was before, for he made the boy give him new straw.",
        "Says the master when he came out, “Go, Jack, and look for the\nheifers, and bring them home.”",
        "“And where will I look for ’em?”",
        "“Go and search for them as if they were your own.” The heifers were\nall in the paddock before sunset.",
        "Next morning, says the master, “Jack, the path across the bog to the\npasture is very bad; the sheep does be sinking in it every step; go\nand make the sheep’s feet a good path.” About an hour after he came\nto the edge of the bog, and what did he find Jack at but sharpening\na carving knife, and the sheep standing or grazing round.",
        "“Is this the way you are mending the path, Jack?” said he.",
        "“Everything must have a beginning, master,” said Jack, “and a thing\nwell begun is half done. I am sharpening the knife, and I’ll have\nthe feet off every sheep in the flock while you’d be blessing\nyourself.”",
        "“Feet off my sheep, you anointed rogue! and what would you be taking\ntheir feet off for?”",
        "“An’ sure to mend the path as you told me. Says you, ’Jack, make a\npath with the foot of the sheep.’”",
        "“Oh, you fool, I meant make good the path for the sheep’s feet.”",
        "“It’s a pity you didn’t say so, master. Hand me out one pound\nthirteen and fourpence if you don’t like me to finish my job.”",
        "“Divel do you good with your one pound thirteen and fourpence!”",
        "“It’s better pray than curse, master. Maybe you’re sorry for your\nbargain?”",
        "“And to be sure I am–not yet, any way.”",
        "The next night the master was going to a wedding; and says he to\nJack, before he set out: “I’ll leave at midnight, and I wish you, to\ncome and be with me home, for fear I might be overtaken with the\ndrink. If you’re there before, you may throw a sheep’s eye at me,\nand I’ll be sure to see that they’ll give you something for\nyourself.”",
        "About eleven o’clock, while the master was in great spirits, he felt\nsomething clammy hit him on the cheek. It fell beside his tumbler,\nand when he looked at it what was it but the eye of a sheep. Well,\nhe couldn’t imagine who threw it at him, or why it was thrown at\nhim. After a little he got a blow on the other cheek, and still it\nwas by another sheep’s eye. Well, he was very vexed, but he thought\nbetter to say nothing. In two minutes more, when he was opening his\nmouth to take a sup, another sheep’s eye was slapped into it. He\nsputtered it out, and cried, “Man o’ the house, isn’t it a great\nshame for you to have any one in the room that would do such a nasty\nthing?”",
        "“Master,” says Jack, “don’t blame the honest man. Sure it’s only\nmyself that was thrown’ them sheep’s eyes at you, to remind you I\nwas here, and that I wanted to drink the bride and bridegroom’s\nhealth. You know yourself bade me.”",
        "“I know that you are a great rascal; and where did you get the\neyes?”",
        "“An’ where would I get em’ but in the heads of your own sheep? Would\nyou have me meddle with the bastes of any neighbour, who might put\nme in the Stone Jug for it?”",
        "“Sorrow on me that ever I had the bad luck to meet with you.”",
        "“You’re all witness,” said Jack, “that my master says he is sorry\nfor having met with me. My time is up. Master, hand me over double\nwages, and come into the next room, and lay yourself out like a man\nthat has some decency in him, till I take a strip of skin an inch\nbroad from your shoulder to your hip.”",
        "Every one shouted out against that; but, says Jack, “You didn’t\nhinder him when he took the same strips from the backs of my two\nbrothers, and sent them home in that state, and penniless, to their\npoor mother.”",
        "When the company heard the rights of the business, they were only\ntoo eager to see the job done. The master bawled and roared, but\nthere was no help at hand. He was stripped to his hips, and laid on\nthe floor in the next room, and Jack had the carving knife in his\nhand ready to begin.",
        "“Now you cruel old villain,” said he, giving the knife a couple of\nscrapes along the floor, “I’ll make you an offer. Give me, along\nwith my double wages, two hundred guineas to support my poor\nbrothers, and I’ll do without the strap.”",
        "“No!” said he, “I’d let you skin me from head to foot first.”",
        "“Here goes then,” said Jack with a grin, but the first little scar\nhe gave, Churl roared out, “Stop your hand; I’ll give the money.”",
        "“Now, neighbours,” said Jack, “you mustn’t think worse of me than I\ndeserve. I wouldn’t have the heart to take an eye out of a rat\nitself; I got half a dozen of them from the butcher, and only used\nthree of them.”",
        "So all came again into the other room, and Jack was made sit down,\nand everybody drank his health, and he drank everybody’s health at\none offer. And six stout fellows saw himself and the master home,\nand waited in the parlour while he went up and brought down the two\nhundred guineas, and double wages for Jack himself. When he got\nhome, he brought the summer along with him to the poor mother and\nthe disabled brothers; and he was no more Jack the Fool in the\npeople’s mouths, but “Skin Churl Jack.”",
        "Print Llewelyn had a favourite greyhound named Gellert that had been\ngiven to him by his father-in-law, King John. He was as gentle as a\nlamb at home but a lion in the chase. One day Llewelyn went to the\nchase and blew his horn in front of his castle. All his other dogs\ncame to the call but Gellert never answered it. So he blew a louder\nblast on his horn and called Gellert by name, but still the\ngreyhound did not come. At last Prince Llewelyn could wait no longer\nand went off to the hunt without Gellert. He had little sport that\nday because Gellert was not there, the swiftest and boldest of his\nhounds.",
        "He turned back in a rage to  his castle, and as he came to the gate,\nwho should he see but Gellert come bounding out to meet him. But\nwhen the hound came near him, the Prince was startled to see that\nhis lips and fangs were dripping with blood. Llewelyn started back\nand the greyhound crouched down at his feet as if surprised or\nafraid at the way his master greeted him.",
        "Now Prince Llewelyn had a little son a year old with whom Gellert\nused to play, and a terrible thought crossed the Prince’s mind that\nmade him rush towards the child’s nursery. And the nearer he came\nthe more blood and disorder he found about the rooms. He rushed into\nit and found the child’s cradle overturned and daubed with blood.",
        "Prince Llewelyn grew more and more terrified, and sought for his\nlittle son everywhere. He could find him nowhere but only signs of\nsome terrible conflict in which much blood had been shed. At last he\nfelt sure the dog had destroyed his child, and shouting to Gellert,\n\"Monster, thou hast devoured my child,” he drew out his sword and\nplunged it in the greyhound’s side, who fell with a deep yell and\nstill gazing in his master’s eyes.",
        "As Gellert raised his dying yell, a little child’s cry answered it\nfrom beneath the cradle, and there Llewelyn found his child unharmed\nand just awakened from sleep. But just beside him lay the body of a\ngreat gaunt wolf all torn to pieces and covered with blood. Too\nlate, Llewelyn learned what had happened while he was away. Gellert\nhad stayed behind to guard the child and had fought and slain the\nwolf that had tried to destroy Llewelyn’s heir.",
        "In vain was all Llewelyn’s grief; he could not bring his faithful\ndog to life again. So he buried him outside the castle walls within\nsight of the great mountain of Snowdon, where every passer-by might\nsee his grave, and raised over it a great cairn of stones. And to\nthis day the place is called Beth Gellert, or the Grave of Gellert.",
        "There were formerly a man and a woman living in the parish of\nLlanlavan, in the place which is called Hwrdh. And work became\nscarce, so the man said to his wife, “I will go search for work, and\nyou may live here.” So he took fair leave, and travelled far toward\nthe East, and at last came to the house of a farmer and asked for\nwork.",
        "“What work can ye do?” said the farmer. “I can do all kinds of\nwork,” said Ivan. Then they agreed upon three pounds for the year’s\nwages.",
        "When the end of the year came his master showed him the three\npounds. “See, Ivan,” said he, “here’s your wage; but if you will\ngive it me back I’ll give you a piece of advice instead.”",
        "“Give me my wage,” said Ivan.",
        "“No, I’ll not,” said the master; “I’ll explain my advice.”",
        "“Tell it me, then,” said Ivan.",
        "Then said the master, “Never leave the old road for the sake of a\nnew one.”",
        "After that they agreed for another year at the old wages, and at the\nend of it Ivan took instead a piece of advice, and this was it:\n\"Never lodge where an old man is married to a young woman.”",
        "The same thing happened at the end of the third year, when the piece\nof advice was: “Honesty is the best policy.”",
        "But Ivan would not stay longer, but wanted to go back to his wife.",
        "“Don’t go to-day,” said his master; “my wife bakes to-morrow, and\nshe shall make thee a cake to take home to thy good woman.”",
        "And when Ivan was going to leave, “Here,” said his master, “here is\na cake for thee to take home to thy wife, and, when ye are most\njoyous together, then break the cake, and not sooner.”",
        "So he took fair leave of them and travelled towards home, and at\nlast he came to Wayn Her, and there he met three merchants from Tre\nRhyn, of his own parish, coming home from Exeter Fair. “Oho! Ivan,\"\nsaid they, “come with us; glad are we to see you. Where have you\nbeen so long?”",
        "“I have been in service,” said Ivan, “and now I’m going home to my\nwife.”",
        "“Oh, come with us! you’ll be right welcome.” But when they took the\nnew road Ivan kept to the old one. And robbers fell upon them before\nthey had gone far from Ivan as they were going by the fields of the\nhouses in the meadow. They began to cry out, “Thieves!” and Ivan\nshouted out “Thieves!” too. And when the robbers heard Ivan’s shout\nthey ran away, and the merchants went by the new road and Ivan by\nthe old one till they met again at Market-Jew.",
        "“Oh, Ivan,” said the merchants, “we are beholding to you; but for\nyou we would have been lost men. Come lodge with us at our cost, and\nwelcome.”",
        "When they came to the place where they used to lodge, Ivan said, “I\nmust see the host.”",
        "“The host,” they cried; “what do you want with the host? Here is the\nhostess, and she’s young and pretty. If you want to see the host\nyou’ll find him in the kitchen.”",
        "So he went into the kitchen to see the host; he found him a weak old\nman turning the spit.",
        "“Oh! oh!” quoth Ivan, “I’ll not lodge here, but will go next door.”",
        "“Not yet,” said the merchants, “sup with us, and welcome.”",
        "Now it happened that the hostess had plotted with a certain monk in\nMarket-Jew to murder the old man in his bed that night while the\nrest were asleep, and they agreed to lay it on the lodgers.",
        "So while Ivan was in bed next door, there was a hole in the pine-end\nof the house, and he saw a light through it. So he got up and\nlooked, and heard the monk speaking. “I had better cover this hole,\"\nsaid he, “or people in the next house may see our deeds.” So he\nstood with his back against it while the hostess killed the old man.",
        "But meanwhile Ivan out with his knife, and putting it through the\nhole, cut a round piece off the monk’s robe. The very next morning\nthe hostess raised the cry that her husband was murdered, and as\nthere was neither man nor child in the house but the merchants, she\ndeclared they ought to be hanged for it.",
        "So they were taken and carried to prison, till a last Ivan came to\nthem. “Alas! alas! Ivan,” cried they, “bad luck sticks to us; our\nhost was killed last night, and we shall be hanged for it.”",
        "“Ah, tell the justices,” said Ivan, “to summon the real murderers.”",
        "“Who knows,” they replied, “who committed the crime?”",
        "“Who committed the crime!” said Ivan. “if I cannot prove who\ncommitted the crime, hang me in your stead.”",
        "So he told all he knew, and brought out the piece of cloth from the\nmonk’s robe, and with that the merchants were set at liberty, and\nthe hostess and the monk were seized and hanged.",
        "Then they came all together out of Market-Jew, and they said to him:\n\"Come as far as Coed Carrn y Wylfa, the Wood of the Heap of Stones\nof Watching, in the parish of Burman.” Then their two roads\nseparated, and though the merchants wished Ivan to go with them, he\nwould not go with them, but went straight home to his wife.",
        "And when his wife saw him she said: “Home in the nick of time.\nHere’s a purse of gold that I’ve found; it has no name, but sure it\nbelongs to the great lord yonder. I was just thinking what to do\nwhen you came.”",
        "Then Ivan thought of the third counsel, and he said “Let us go and\ngive it to the great lord.”",
        "So they went up to the castle, but the great lord was not in it, so\nthey left the purse with the servant that minded the gate, and then\nthey went home again and lived in quiet for a time.",
        "But one day the great lord stopped at their house for a drink of\nwater, and Ivan’s wife said to him: “I hope your lordship found your\nlordship’s purse quite safe with all its money in it.”",
        "“What purse is that you are talking about?” said the lord.",
        "“Sure, it’s your lordship’s purse that I left at the castle,” said\nIvan.",
        "“Come with me and we will see into the matter,” said the lord.",
        "So Ivan and his wife went up to the castle, and there they pointed\nout the man to whom they had given the purse, and he had to give it\nup and was sent away from the castle. And the lord was so pleased\nwith Ivan that he made him his servant in the stead of the thief.",
        "“Honesty’s the best policy!” quoth Ivan, as he skipped about in his\nnew quarters. “How joyful I am!”",
        "Then he thought of his old master’s cake that he was to eat when he\nwas most joyful, and when he broke it, to and behold, inside it was\nhis wages for the three years he had been with him.",
        "My grandfather, Andrew Coffey, was known to the whole barony as a\nquiet, decent man. And if the whole barony knew him, he knew the\nwhole barony, every inch, hill and dale, bog and pasture, field and\ncovert. Fancy his surprise one evening, when he found himself in a\npart of the demesne he couldn’t recognise a bit. He and his good\nhorse were always stumbling up against some tree or stumbling down\ninto some bog-hole that by rights didn’t ought to be there. On the\ntop of all this the rain came pelting down wherever there was a\nclearing, and the cold March wind tore through the trees. Glad he\nwas then when he saw a light in the distance, and drawing near found\na cabin, though for the life of him he couldn’t think how it came\nthere. However, in he walked, after tying up his horse, and right\nwelcome was the brushwood fire blazing on the hearth. And there\nstood a chair right and tight, that seemed to say, “Come, sit down\nin me.” There wasn’t a soul else in the room. Well, he did sit, and\ngot a little warm and cheered after his drenching. But all the while\nhe was wondering and wondering.",
        "“Andrew Coffey! Andrew Coffey!”",
        "Good heavens! who was calling him, and not a soul in sight? Look\naround as he might, indoors and out, he could find no creature with\ntwo legs or four, for his horse was gone.",
        "“ANDREW COFFEY! ANDREW COFFEY! tell me a story.”",
        "It was louder this time, and it was nearer. And then what a thing to\nask for! It was bad enough not to be let sit by the fire and dry\noneself, without being bothered for a story.",
        "“ANDREW COFFEY! ANDREW COFFEY!! Tell me a story, or it’ll be the\nworse for you.”",
        "My poor grandfather was so dumbfounded that he could only stand and\nstare.",
        "“ANDREW COFFEY! ANDREW COFFEY! I told you it’d be the worse for\nyou.”",
        "And with that, out there bounced, from a cupboard that Andrew\nCoffey had never noticed before, a man. And the man was in a\ntowering rage. But it wasn’t that. And he carried as fine a\nblackthorn as you’d wish to crack a man’s head with. But it wasn’t\nthat either. But when my grandfather clapped eyes on him, he knew\nhim for Patrick Rooney, and all the world knew he’d gone\noverboard, fishing one night long years before.",
        "Andrew Coffey would neither stop nor stay, but he took to his heels\nand was out of the house as hard as he could. He ran and he ran\ntaking little thought of what was before till at last he ran up\nagainst a big tree. And then he sat down to rest.",
        "He hadn’t sat for a moment when he heard voices.",
        "“It’s heavy he is, the vagabond.” “Steady now, we’ll rest when we\nget under the big tree yonder.” Now that happened to be the tree\nunder which Andrew Coffey was sitting. At least he thought so, for\nseeing a branch handy he swung himself up by it and was soon snugly\nhidden away. Better see than be seen, thought he.",
        "The rain had stopped and the wind fallen. The night was blacker than\never, but Andrew Coffey could see four men, and they were carrying\nbetween them a long box. Under the tree they came, set the box down,\nopened it, and who should they bring out but–Patrick Rooney. Never\na word did he say, and he looked as pale as old snow.",
        "Well, one gathered brushwood, and another took out tinder and flint,\nand soon they had a big fire roaring, and my grandfather could see\nPatrick plainly enough. If he had kept still before, he kept stiller\nnow. Soon they had four poles up and a pole across, right over the\nfire, for all the world like a spit, and on to the pole they slung\nPatrick Rooney.",
        "“He’ll do well enough,” said one; “but who’s to mind him whilst\nwe’re away, who’ll turn the fire, who’ll see that he doesn’t burn?”",
        "With that Patrick opened his lips: “Andrew Coffey,” said he.",
        "“Andrew Coffey! Andrew Coffey! Andrew Coffey! Andrew Coffey!”",
        "“I’m much obliged to you, gentlemen,” said Andrew Coffey, “but\nindeed I know nothing about the business.”",
        "“You’d better come down, Andrew Coffey,” said Patrick.",
        "It was the second time he spoke, and Andrew Coffey decided he would\ncome down. The four men went off and he was left all alone with\nPatrick.",
        "Then he sat and he kept the fire even, and he kept the spit turning,\nand all the while Patrick looked at him.",
        "Poor Andrew Coffey couldn’t make it all out at all, at all, and he\nstared at Patrick and at the fire, and he thought of the little\nhouse in the wood, till he felt quite dazed.",
        "“Ah, but it’s burning me ye are!” says Patrick, very short and\nsharp.",
        "“I’m sure I beg your pardon,” said my grandfather “but might I ask\nyou a question?”",
        "“If you want a crooked answer,” said Patrick; “turn away or it’ll be\nthe worse for you.”",
        "But my grandfather couldn’t get it out of his head; hadn’t\neverybody, far and near, said Patrick had fallen overboard. There\nwas enough to think about, and my grandfather did think.",
        "“ANDREW COFFEY! ANDREW COFFEY! IT’S BURNING ME YE ARE.”",
        "Sorry enough my grandfather was, and he vowed he wouldn’t do so\nagain.",
        "“You’d better not,” said Patrick, and he gave him a cock of his eye,\nand a grin of his teeth, that just sent a shiver down Andrew\nCoffey’s back. Well it was odd, that here he should be in a thick\nwood he had never set eyes upon, turning Patrick Rooney upon a spit.\nYou can’t wonder at my grandfather thinking and thinking and not\nminding the fire.",
        "“ANDREW COFFEY, ANDREW COFFEY, IT’S THE DEATH OF YOU I’LL BE.”",
        "And with that what did my grandfather see, but Patrick unslinging\nhimself from the spit and his eyes glared and his teeth glistened.",
        "It was neither stop nor stay my grandfather made, but out he ran\ninto the night of the wood. It seemed to him there wasn’t a stone\nbut was for his stumbling, not a branch but beat his face, not a\nbramble but tore his skin. And wherever it was clear the rain pelted\ndown and the cold March wind howled along.",
        "Glad he was to see a light, and a minute after he was kneeling,\ndazed, drenched, and bedraggled by the hearth side. The brushwood\nflamed, and the brushwood crackled, and soon my grandfather began to\nfeel a little warm and dry and easy in his mind.",
        "“ANDREW COFFEY! ANDREW COFFEY!”",
        "It’s hard for a man to jump when he has been through all my\ngrandfather had, but jump he did. And when he looked around, where\nshould he find himself but in the very cabin he had first met\nPatrick in.",
        "“Andrew Coffey, Andrew Coffey, tell me a story.”",
        "“Is it a story you want?” said my grandfather as bold as may be, for\nhe was just tired of being frightened. “Well if you can tell me the\nrights of this one, I’ll be thankful.”",
        "And he told the tale of what had befallen him from first to last\nthat night. The tale was long, and may be Andrew Coffey was weary.\nIt’s asleep he must have fallen, for when he awoke he lay on the\nhill-side under the open heavens, and his horse grazed at his side.",
        "I will tell you a story about the wren. There was once a farmer who\nwas seeking a servant, and the wren met him and said: “What are you\nseeking?”",
        "“I am seeking a servant,” said the farmer to the wren.",
        "“Will you take me?” said the wren.",
        "“You, you poor creature, what good would you do?”",
        "“Try me,” said the wren.",
        "So he engaged him, and the first work he set him to do was threshing\nin the barn. The wren threshed (what did he thresh with? Why a flail\nto be sure), and he knocked off one grain. A mouse came out and she\neats that.",
        "“I’ll trouble you not to do that again,” said the wren.",
        "He struck again, and he struck off two grains. Out came the mouse\nand she eats them. So they arranged a contest to see who was\nstrongest, and the wren brings his twelve birds, and the mouse her\ntribe.",
        "“You have your tribe with you,” said the wren.",
        "“As well as yourself,” said the mouse, and she struck out her leg\nproudly. But the wren broke it with his flail, and there was a\npitched battle on a set day.",
        "When every creature and bird was gathering to battle, the son of the\nking of Tethertown said that he would go to see the battle, and that\nhe would bring sure word home to his father the king, who would be\nking of the creatures this year. The battle was over before he\narrived all but one fight, between a great black raven and a snake.\nThe snake was twined about the raven’s neck, and the raven held the\nsnake’s throat in his beak, and it seemed as if the snake would get\nthe victory over the raven. When the king’s son saw this he helped\nthe raven, and with one blow takes the head off the snake. When the\nraven had taken breath, and saw that the snake was dead, he said,\n\"For thy kindness to me this day, I will give thee a sight. Come up\nnow on the root of my two wings.” The king’s son put his hands about\nthe raven before his wings, and, before he stopped, he took him over\nnine Bens, and nine Glens, and nine Mountain Moors.",
        "“Now,” said the raven, “see you that house yonder? Go now to it. It\nis a sister of mine that makes her dwelling in it; and I will go\nbail that you are welcome. And if she asks you, Were you at the\nbattle of the birds? say you were. And if she asks, ’Did you see any\none like me,’ say you did, but be sure that you meet me to-morrow\nmorning here, in this place.” The king’s son got good and right good\ntreatment that night. Meat of each meat, drink of each drink, warm\nwater to his feet, and a soft bed for his limbs.",
        "On the next day the raven gave him the same sight over six Bens, and\nsix Glens, and six Mountain Moors. They saw a bothy far off, but,\nthough far off, they were soon there. He got good treatment this\nnight, as before–plenty of meat and drink, and warm water to his\nfeet, and a soft bed to his limbs–and on the next day it was the\nsame thing, over three Bens and three Glens, and three Mountain\nMoors.",
        "On the third morning, instead of seeing the raven as at the other\ntimes, who should meet him but the handsomest lad he ever saw, with\ngold rings in his hair, with a bundle in his hand. The king’s son\nasked this lad if he had seen a big black raven.",
        "Said the lad to him, “You will never see the raven again, for I am\nthat raven. I was put under spells by a bad druid; it was meeting\nyou that loosed me, and for that you shall get this bundle. Now,\"\nsaid the lad, “you must turn back on the self-same steps, and lie a\nnight in each house as before; but you must not loose the bundle\nwhich I gave ye, till in the place where you would most wish to\ndwell.”",
        "The king’s son turned his back to the lad, and his face to his\nfather’s house; and he got lodging from the raven’s sisters, just as\nhe got it when going forward. When he was nearing his father’s house\nhe was going through a close wood. It seemed to him that the bundle\nwas growing heavy, and he thought he would look what was in it.",
        "When he loosed the bundle he was astonished. In a twinkling he sees\nthe very grandest place he ever saw. A great castle, and an orchard\nabout the castle, in which was every kind of fruit and herb. He\nstood full of wonder and regret for having loosed the bundle–for it\nwas not in his power to put it back again–and he would have wished\nthis pretty place to be in the pretty little green hollow that was\nopposite his father’s house; but he looked up and saw a great giant\ncoming towards him.",
        "“Bad’s the place where you have built the house, king’s son,” says\nthe giant.",
        "“Yes, but it is not here I would wish it to be, though it happens to\nbe here by mishap,” says the king’s son.",
        "“What’s the reward for putting it back in the bundle as it was\nbefore?”",
        "“What’s the reward you would ask?” says the king’s son.",
        "“That you will give me the first son you have when he is seven years\nof age,” says the giant.",
        "“If I have a son you shall have him,” said the king’s son.",
        "In a twinkling the giant put each garden, and orchard, and castle in\nthe bundle as they were before.",
        "“Now,” says the giant, “take your own road, and I will take mine;\nbut mind your promise, and if you forget I will remember.”",
        "The king’s son took to the road, and at the end of a few days he\nreached the place he was fondest of. He loosed the bundle, and the\ncastle was just as it was before. And when he opened the castle door\nhe sees the handsomest maiden he ever cast eye upon.",
        "“Advance, king’s son,” said the pretty maid; “everything is in order\nfor you, if you will marry me this very day.”",
        "“It’s I that am willing,” said the king’s son. And on the same day\nthey married.",
        "But at the end of a day and seven years, who should be seen coming\nto the castle but the giant. The king’s son was reminded of his\npromise to the giant, and till now he had not told his promise to\nthe queen.",
        "“Leave the matter between me and the giant,” says the queen.",
        "“Turn out your son,” says the giant; “mind your promise.”",
        "“You shall have him,” says the king, “when his mother puts him in\norder for his journey.”",
        "The queen dressed up the cook’s son, and she gave him to the giant\nby the hand. The giant went away with him; but he had not gone far\nwhen he put a rod in the hand of the little laddie. The giant asked\nhim–",
        "“If thy father had that rod what would he do with it?”",
        "“If my father had that rod he would beat the dogs and the cats, so\nthat they shouldn’t be going near the king’s meat,” said the little\nladdie.",
        "“Thou’rt the cook’s son,” said the giant. He catches him by the two\nsmall ankles and knocks him against the stone that was beside him.\nThe giant turned back to the castle in rage and madness, and he said\nthat if they did not send out the king’s son to him, the highest\nstone of the castle would be the lowest.",
        "Said the queen to the king, “We’ll try it yet; the butler’s son is\nof the same age as our son.”",
        "She dressed up the butler’s son, and she gives him to the giant by\nthe hand. The giant had not gone far when he put the rod in his\nhand.",
        "“If thy father had that rod,” says the giant, “what would he do with\nit?”",
        "“He would beat the dogs and the cats when they would be coming near\nthe king’s bottles and glasses.”",
        "“Thou art the son of the butler,” says the giant and dashed his\nbrains out too. The giant returned in a very great rage and anger.\nThe earth shook under the sole of his feet, and the castle shook and\nall that was in it.",
        "“OUT HERE WITH THY SON,” says the giant, “or in a twinkling the\nstone that is highest in the dwelling will be the lowest.” So they\nhad to give the king’s son to the giant.",
        "When they were gone a little bit from the earth, the giant showed\nhim the rod that was in his hand and said: “What would thy father do\nwith this rod if he had it?”",
        "The king’s son said: “My father has a braver rod than that.”",
        "And the giant asked him, “Where is thy father when he has that brave\nrod?”",
        "And the king’s son said: “He will be sitting in his kingly chair.”",
        "Then the giant understood that he had the right one.",
        "The giant took him to his own house, and he reared him as his own\nson. On a day of days when the giant was from home, the lad heard\nthe sweetest music he ever heard in a room at the top of the giant’s\nhouse. At a glance he saw the finest face he had ever seen. She\nbeckoned to him to come a bit nearer to her, and she said her name\nwas Auburn Mary but she told him to go this time, but to be sure to\nbe at the same place about that dead midnight.",
        "And as he promised he did. The giant’s daughter was at his side in a\ntwinkling, and she said, “To-morrow you will get the choice of my\ntwo sisters to marry; but say that you will not take either, but me.\nMy father wants me to marry the son of the king of the Green City,\nbut I don’t like him.” On the morrow the giant took out his three\ndaughters, and he said:",
        "“Now, son of the king of Tethertown, thou hast not lost by living\nwith me so long. Thou wilt get to wife one of the two eldest of my\ndaughters, and with her leave to go home with her the day after the\nwedding.”",
        "“If you will give me this pretty little one,” says the king’s son,\n\"I will take you at your word.”",
        "The giant’s wrath kindled, and he said: “Before thou gett’st her\nthou must do the three things that I ask thee to do.”",
        "“Say on,” says the king’s son.",
        "The giant took him to the byre.",
        "“Now,” says the giant, “a hundred cattle are stabled here, and it has\nnot been cleansed for seven years. I am going from home to-day, and\nif this byre is not cleaned before night comes, so clean that a\ngolden apple will run from end to end of it, not only thou shalt not\nget my daughter, but ’tis only a drink of thy fresh, goodly,\nbeautiful blood that will quench my thirst this night.”",
        "He begins cleaning the byre, but he might just as well to keep\nbaling the great ocean. After midday when sweat was blinding him,\nthe giant’s youngest daughter came where he was, and she said to\nhim:",
        "“You are being punished, king’s son.”",
        "“I am that,” says the king’s son.",
        "“Come over,” says Auburn Mary, “and lay down your weariness.”",
        "“I will do that,” says he, “there is but death awaiting me, at any\nrate.” He sat down near her. He was so tired that he fell asleep\nbeside her. When he awoke, the giant’s daughter was not to be seen,\nbut the byre was so well cleaned that a golden apple would run from\nend to end of it and raise no stain. In comes the giant, and he\nsaid:",
        "“Hast thou cleaned the byre, king’s son?”",
        "“I have cleaned it,” says he.",
        "“Somebody cleaned it,” says the giant.",
        "“You did not clean it, at all events,” said the king’s son.",
        "“Well, well!” says the giant, “since thou wert so active to-day,\nthou wilt get to this time to-morrow to thatch this byre with birds’\ndown, from birds with no two feathers of one colour.”",
        "The king’s son was on foot before the sun; he caught up his bow and\nhis quiver of arrows to kill the birds. He took to the moors, but if\nhe did, the birds were not so easy to take. He was running after\nthem till the sweat was blinding him. About mid-day who should come\nbut Auburn Mary.",
        "“You are exhausting yourself, king’s son,” says she.",
        "“I am,” said he.",
        "“There fell but these two blackbirds, and both of one colour.”",
        "“Come over and lay down your weariness on this pretty hillock,” says\nthe giant’s daughter.",
        "“It’s I am willing,” said he.",
        "He thought she would aid him this time, too, and he sat down near\nher, and he was not long there till he fell asleep.",
        "When he awoke, Auburn Mary was gone. He thought he would go back to\nthe house, and he sees the byre thatched with feathers. When the\ngiant came home, he said:",
        "“Hast thou thatched the byre, king’s son?”",
        "“I thatched it,” says he.",
        "“Somebody thatched it,” says the giant.",
        "“You did not thatch it,” says the king’s son.",
        "“Yes, yes!” says the giant. “Now,” says the giant, “there is a fir\ntree beside that loch down there, and there is a magpie’s nest in\nits top. The eggs thou wilt find in the nest. I must have them for\nmy first meal. Not one must be burst or broken, and there are five\nin the nest.”",
        "Early in the morning the king’s son went where the tree was, and\nthat tree was not hard to hit upon. Its match was not in the whole\nwood. From the foot to the first branch was five hundred feet. The\nking’s son was going all round the tree. She came who was always\nbringing help to him.",
        "“You are losing the skin of your hands and feet.”",
        "“Ach! I am,” says he. “I am no sooner up than down.”",
        "“This is no time for stopping,” says the giant’s daughter. “Now you\nmust kill me, strip the flesh from my bones, take all those bones\napart, and use them as steps for climbing the tree. When you are\nclimbing the tree, they will stick to the glass as if they had grown\nout of it; but when you are coming down, and have put your foot on\neach one, they will drop into your hand when you touch them. Be sure\nand stand on each bone, leave none untouched; if you do, it will\nstay behind. Put all my flesh into this clean cloth by the side of\nthe spring at the roots of the tree. When you come to the earth,\narrange my bones together, put the flesh over them, sprinkle it with\nwater from the spring, and I shall be alive before you. But don’t\nforget a bone of me on the tree.”",
        "“How could I kill you,” asked the king’s son, “after what you have\ndone for me?”",
        "“If you won’t obey, you and I are done for,” said Auburn Mary. “You\nmust climb the tree, or we are lost; and to climb the tree you must\ndo as I say.”  The king’s son obeyed. He killed Auburn Mary, cut the\nflesh from her body, and unjointed the bones, as she had told him.",
        "As he went up, the king’s son put the bones of Auburn Mary’s body\nagainst the side of the tree, using them as steps, till he came\nunder the nest and stood on the last bone.",
        "Then he took the eggs, and coming down, put his foot on every bone,\nthen took it with him, till he came to the last bone, which was so\nnear the ground that he failed to touch it with his foot.",
        "He now placed all the bones of Auburn Mary in order again at the\nside of the spring, put the flesh on them, sprinkled it with water\nfrom the spring. She rose up before him, and said: “Didn’t I tell\nyou not to leave a bone of my body without stepping on it? Now I am\nlame for life! You left my little finger on the tree without\ntouching it, and I have but nine fingers.”",
        "“Now,” says she, “go home with the eggs quickly, and you will get\nme to marry to-night if you can know me. I and my two sisters will\nbe arrayed in the same garments, and made like each other, but look\nat me when my father says, ’Go to thy wife, king’s son;’ and you\nwill see a hand without a little finger.”",
        "He gave the eggs to the giant.",
        "“Yes, yes!” says the giant, “be making ready for your marriage.”",
        "Then, indeed, there was a wedding, and it was a wedding!\nGiants and gentlemen, and the son of the king of the Green City was\nin the midst of them. They were married, and the dancing began, that\nwas a dance! The giant’s house was shaking from top to bottom.",
        "But bed time came, and the giant said, “It is time for thee to go to\nrest, son of the king of Tethertown; choose thy bride to take with\nthee from amidst those.”",
        "She put out the hand off which the little finger was, and he caught\nher by the hand.",
        "“Thou hast aimed well this time too; but there is no knowing but we\nmay meet thee another way,” said the giant.",
        "But to rest they went. “Now,” says she, “sleep not, or else you are\na dead man. We must fly quick, quick, or for certain my father will\nkill you.”",
        "Out they went, and on the blue grey filly in the stable they\nmounted. “Stop a while,” says she, “and I will play a trick to the\nold hero.” She jumped in, and cut an apple into nine shares, and she\nput two shares at the head of the bed, and two shares at the foot of\nthe bed, and two shares at the door of the kitchen, and two shares\nat the big door, and one outside the house.",
        "The giant awoke and called, “Are you asleep?”",
        "“Not yet,” said the apple that was at the head of the bed.",
        "At the end of a while he called again.",
        "“Not yet,” said the apple that was at the foot of the bed.",
        "A while after this he called again: “Are your asleep?”",
        "“Not yet,” said the apple at the kitchen door.",
        "The giant called again.",
        "The apple that was at the big door answered.",
        "“You are now going far from me,” says the giant.",
        "“Not yet,” says the apple that was outside the house.",
        "“You are flying,” says the giant. The giant jumped on his feet, and\nto the bed he went, but it was cold–empty.",
        "“My own daughter’s tricks are trying me,” said the giant. “Here’s\nafter them,” says he.",
        "At the mouth of day, the giant’s daughter said that her father’s\nbreath was burning her back.",
        "“Put your hand, quick,” said she, “in the ear of the grey filly, and\nwhatever you find in it, throw it behind us.”",
        "“There is a twig of sloe tree,” said he.",
        "“Throw it behind us,” said she.",
        "No sooner did he that, than there were twenty miles of blackthorn\nwood, so thick that scarce a weasel could go through it.",
        "The giant came headlong, and there he is fleecing his head and neck\nin the thorns.",
        "“My own daughter’s tricks are here as before,” said the giant; “but\nif I had my own big axe and wood knife here, I would not be long\nmaking a way through this.”",
        "He went home for the big axe and the wood knife, and sure he was not\nlong on his journey, and he was the boy behind the big axe. He was\nnot long making a way through the blackthorn.",
        "“I will leave the axe and the wood knife here till I return,” says\nhe.",
        "“If you leave ’em, leave ’em,” said a hoodie that was in a tree,\n\"we’ll steal ’em, steal ’em.”",
        "“If you will do that,” says the giant, “I must take them home.” He\nreturned home and left them at the house.",
        "At the heat of day the giant’s daughter felt her father’s breath\nburning her back.",
        "“Put your finger in the filly’s ear, and throw behind whatever you\nfind in it.”",
        "He got a splinter of grey stone, and in a twinkling there were\ntwenty miles, by breadth and height, of great grey rock behind them.",
        "The giant came full pelt, but past the rock he could not go.",
        "“The tricks of my own daughter are the hardest things that ever met\nme,” says the giant; “but if I had my lever and my mighty mattock, I\nwould not be long in making my way through this rock also.”",
        "There was no help for it, but to turn the chase for them; and he was\nthe boy to split the stones. He was not long in making a road\nthrough the rock.",
        "“I will leave the tools here, and I will return no more.”",
        "“If you leave ’em, leave ’em,” says the hoodie, “we will steal ’em,\nsteal ’em.”",
        "“Do that if you will; there is no time to go back.”",
        "At the time of breaking the watch, the giant’s daughter said that\nshe felt her father’s breath burning her back.",
        "“Look in the filly’s ear, king’s son, or else we are lost.”",
        "He did so, and it was a bladder of water that was in her ear this\ntime. He threw it behind him and there was a fresh-water loch,\ntwenty miles in length and breadth, behind them.",
        "The giant came on, but with the speed he had on him, he was in the\nmiddle of the loch, and he went under, and he rose no more.",
        "On the next day the young companions were come in sight of his\nfather’s house. “Now,” says she, “my father is drowned, and he won’t\ntrouble us any more; but before we go further,” says she, “go you to\nyour father’s house, and tell that you have the likes of me; but let\nneither man nor creature kiss you, for if you do, you will not\nremember that you have ever seen me.”",
        "Every one he met gave him welcome and luck, and he charged his\nfather and mother not to kiss him; but as mishap was to be, an old\ngreyhound was indoors, and she knew him, and jumped up to his mouth,\nand after that he did not remember the giant’s daughter.",
        "She was sitting at the well’s side as he left her, but the king’s\nson was not coming. In the mouth of night she climbed up into a tree\nof oak that was beside the well, and she lay in the fork of that\ntree all night. A shoemaker had a house near the well, and about\nmid-day on the morrow, the shoemaker asked his wife to go for a\ndrink for him out of the well. When the shoemaker’s wife reached the\nwell, and when she saw the shadow of her that was in the tree,\nthinking it was her own shadow–and she never thought till now that\nshe was so handsome–she gave a cast to the dish that was in her\nhand, and it was broken on the ground, and she took herself to the\nhouse without vessel or water.",
        "“Where is the water, wife?” said the shoemaker.",
        "“You shambling, contemptible old carle, without grace, I have stayed\ntoo long your water and wood thrall.”",
        "“I think, wife, that you have turned crazy. Go you, daughter,\nquickly, and fetch a drink for your father.”",
        "His daughter went, and in the same way so it happened to her. She\nnever thought till now that she was so lovable, and she took herself\nhome.",
        "“Up with the drink,” said her father.",
        "“You home-spun shoe carle, do you think I am fit to be your thrall?”",
        "The poor shoemaker thought that they had taken a turn in their\nunderstandings, and he went himself to the well. He saw the shadow\nof the maiden in the well, and he looked up to the tree, and he sees\nthe finest woman he ever saw.",
        "“Your seat is wavering, but your face is fair,” said the shoemaker.\n\"Come down, for there is need of you for a short while at my house.”",
        "The shoemaker understood that this was the shadow that had driven\nhis people mad. The shoemaker took her to his house, and he said\nthat he had but a poor bothy, but that she should get a share of all\nthat was in it.",
        "One day, the shoemaker had shoes ready, for on that very day the\nking’s son was to be married. The shoemaker was going to the castle\nwith the shoes of the young people, and the girl said to the\nshoemaker, “I would like to get a sight of the king’s son before he\nmarries.”",
        "“Come with me,” says the shoemaker, “I am well acquainted with the\nservants at the castle, and you shall get a sight of the king’s son\nand all the company.”",
        "And when the gentles saw the pretty woman that was here they took\nher to the wedding-room, and they filled for her a glass of wine.\nWhen she was going to drink what is in it, a flame went up out of\nthe glass, and a golden pigeon and a silver pigeon sprang out of it.\nThey were flying about when three grains of barley fell on the\nfloor. The silver pigeon sprung, and ate that up.",
        "Said the golden pigeon to him, “If you remembered when I cleared the\nbyre, you would not eat that without giving me a share.”",
        "Again there fell three other grains of barley, and the silver pigeon\nsprung, and ate that up as before.",
        "“If you remembered when I thatched the byre, you would not eat that\nwithout giving me my share,” says the golden pigeon.",
        "Three other grains fall, and the silver pigeon sprung, and ate that\nup.",
        "“If you remembered when I harried the magpie’s nest, you would not\neat that without giving me my share,” says the golden pigeon; “I\nlost my little finger bringing it down, and I want it still.”",
        "The king’s son minded, and he knew who it was that was before him.",
        "“Well,” said the king’s son to the guests at the feast, “when I was\na little younger than I am now, I lost the key of a casket that I\nhad. I had a new key made, but after it was brought to me I found\nthe old one. Now, I’ll leave it to any one here to tell me what I am\nto do. Which of the keys should I keep?”",
        "“My advice to you,” said one of the guests, “is to keep the old key,\nfor it fits the lock better and you’re more used to it.”",
        "Then the king’s son stood up and said: “I thank you for a wise\nadvice and an honest word. This is my bride the daughter of the\ngiant who saved my life at the risk of her own. I’ll have her and no\nother woman.”",
        "So the king’s son married Auburn Mary and the wedding lasted long\nand all were happy. But all I got was butter on a live coal,\nporridge in a basket, and they sent me for water to the stream, and\nthe paper shoes came to an end.",
        "In Treneglwys there is a certain shepherd’s cot known by the name of\nTwt y Cymrws because of the strange strife that occurred there.\nThere once lived there a man and his wife, and they had twins whom\nthe woman nursed tenderly. One day she was called away to the house\nof a neighbour at some distance. She did not much like going and\nleaving her little ones all alone in a solitary house, especially as\nshe had heard tell of the good folk haunting the neighbourhood.",
        "Well, she went and came back as soon as she could, but on her way\nback she was frightened to see some old elves of the blue petticoat\ncrossing her path though it was midday. She rushed home, but found\nher two little ones in the cradle and everything seemed as it was\nbefore.",
        "But after a time the good people began to suspect that something was\nwrong, for the twins didn’t grow at all.",
        "The man said: “They’re not ours.”",
        "The woman said: “Whose else should they be?”",
        "And so arose the great strife so that the neighbours named the\ncottage after it. It made the woman very sad, so one evening she\nmade up her mind to go and see the Wise Man of Llanidloes, for he\nknew everything and would advise her what to do.",
        "So she went to Llanidloes and told the case to the Wise Man. Now\nthere was soon to be a harvest of rye and oats, so the Wise Man said\nto her, “When you are getting dinner for the reapers, clear out the\nshell of a hen’s egg and boil some potage in it, and then take it to\nthe door as if you meant it as a dinner for the reapers. Then listen\nif the twins say anything. If you hear them speaking of things\nbeyond the understanding of children, go back and take them up and\nthrow them into the waters of Lake Elvyn. But if you don’t hear\nanything remarkable, do them no injury.”",
        "So when the day of the reap came the woman did all that the Wise Man\nordered, and put the eggshell on the fire and took it off and\ncarried it to the door, and there she stood and listened. Then she\nheard one of the children say to the other:",
        "  Acorn before oak I knew,\n    An egg before a hen,\n  But I never heard of an eggshell brew\n    A dinner for harvest men.",
        "So she went back into the house, seized the children and threw them\ninto the Llyn, and the goblins in their blue trousers came and saved\ntheir dwarfs and the mother had her own children back and so the\ngreat strife ended.",
        "Long ago, a poor widow woman lived down near the iron forge, by\nEnniscorth, and she was so poor she had no clothes to put on her\nson; so she used to fix him in the ash-hole, near the fire, and pile\nthe warm ashes about him; and according as he grew up, she sunk the\npit deeper. At last, by hook or by crook, she got a goat-skin, and\nfastened it round his waist, and he felt quite grand, and took a\nwalk down the street. So says she to him next morning, “Tom, you\nthief, you never done any good yet, and you six foot high, and past\nnineteen;–take that rope and bring me a faggot from the wood.”",
        "“Never say’t twice, mother,” says Tom–\"here goes.”",
        "When he had it gathered and tied, what should come up but a big\ngiant, nine foot high, and made a lick of a club at him. Well become\nTom, he jumped a-one side, and picked up a ram-pike; and the first\ncrack he gave the big fellow, he made him kiss the clod.",
        "“If you have e’er a prayer,” says Tom, “now’s the time to say it,\nbefore I make fragments of you.”",
        "“I have no prayers,” says the giant; “but if you spare my life I’ll\ngive you that club; and as long as you keep from sin, you’ll win\nevery battle you ever fight with it.”",
        "Tom made no bones about letting him off; and as soon as he got the\nclub in his hands, he sat down on the bresna, and gave it a tap with\nthe kippeen, and says, “Faggot, I had great trouble gathering you,\nand run the risk of my life for you, the least you can do is to\ncarry me home.” And sure enough, the wind o’ the word was all it\nwanted. It went off through the wood, groaning and crackling, till\nit came to the widow’s door.",
        "Well, when the sticks were all burned, Tom was sent off again to\npick more; and this time he had to fight with a giant that had two\nheads on him. Tom had a little more trouble with him–that’s all;\nand the prayers he said, was to give Tom a fife; that nobody could\nhelp dancing when he was playing it. Begonies, he made the big\nfaggot dance home, with himself sitting on it. The next giant was a\nbeautiful boy with three heads on him. He had neither prayers nor\ncatechism no more nor the others; and so he gave Tom a bottle of\ngreen ointment, that wouldn’t let you be burned, nor scalded, nor\nwounded. “And now,” says he, “there’s no more of us. You may come\nand gather sticks here till little Lunacy Day in Harvest, without\ngiant or fairy-man to disturb you.”",
        "Well, now, Tom was prouder nor ten paycocks, and used to take a walk\ndown street in the heel of the evening; but some o’ the little boys\nhad no more manners than if they were Dublin jackeens, and put out\ntheir tongues at Tom’s club and Tom’s goat-skin. He didn’t like that\nat all, and it would be mean to give one of them a clout. At last,\nwhat should come through the town but a kind of a bellman, only it’s\na big bugle he had, and a huntsman’s cap on his head, and a kind of\na painted shirt. So this–he wasn’t a bellman, and I don’t know what\nto call him–bugleman, maybe, proclaimed that the King of Dublin’s\ndaughter was so melancholy that she didn’t give a laugh for seven\nyears, and that her father would grant her in marriage to whoever\ncould make her laugh three times.",
        "“That’s the very thing for me to try,” says Tom; and so, without\nburning any more daylight, he kissed his mother, curled his club at\nthe little boys, and off he set along the yalla highroad to the town\nof Dublin.",
        "At last Tom came to one of the city gates, and the guards laughed\nand cursed at him instead of letting him in. Tom stood it all for a\nlittle time, but at last one of them–out of fun, as he said–drove\nhis bayonet half an inch or so into his side. Tom done nothing but\ntake the fellow by the scruff o’ the neck and the waistband of his\ncorduroys, and fling him into the canal. Some run to pull the fellow\nout, and others to let manners into the vulgarian with their swords\nand daggers; but a tap from his club sent them headlong into the\nmoat or down on the stones, and they were soon begging him to stay\nhis hands.",
        "So at last one of them was glad enough to show Tom the way to the\npalace-yard; and there was the king, and the queen, and the\nprincess, in a gallery, looking at all sorts of wrestling, and\nsword-playing, and long-dances, and mumming, all to please the\nprincess; but not a smile came over her handsome face.",
        "Well, they all stopped when they seen the young giant, with his\nboy’s face, and long black hair, and his short curly beard–for his\npoor mother couldn’t afford to buy razors–and his great strong\narms, and bare legs, and no covering but the goat-skin that reached\nfrom his waist to his knees. But an envious wizened bit of a fellow,\nwith a red head, that wished to be married to the princess, and\ndidn’t like how she opened her eyes at Tom, came forward, and asked\nhis business very snappishly.",
        "“My business,” says Tom, says he, “is to make the beautiful\nprincess, God bless her, laugh three times.”",
        "“Do you see all them merry fellows and skilful swordsmen,” says the\nother, “that could eat you up with a grain of salt, and not a\nmother’s soul of ’em ever got a laugh from her these seven years?”",
        "So the fellows gathered round Tom, and the bad man aggravated him\ntill he told them he didn’t care a pinch o’ snuff for the whole\nbilin’ of ’em; let ’em come on, six at a time, and try what they\ncould do.",
        "The king, who was too far off to hear what they were saying, asked\nwhat did the stranger want.",
        "“He wants,” says the red-headed fellow, “to make hares of your best\nmen.”",
        "“Oh!” says the king, “if that’s the way, let one of ’em turn out and\ntry his mettle.”",
        "So one stood forward, with sword and pot-lid, and made a cut at Tom.\nHe struck the fellow’s elbow with the club, and up over their heads\nflew the sword, and down went the owner of it on the gravel from a\nthump he got on the helmet. Another took his place, and another, and\nanother, and then half a dozen at once, and Tom sent swords,\nhelmets, shields, and bodies, rolling over and over, and themselves\nbawling out that they were kilt, and disabled, and damaged, and\nrubbing their poor elbows and hips, and limping away. Tom contrived\nnot to kill any one; and the princess was so amused, that she let a\ngreat sweet laugh out of her that was heard over all the yard.",
        "“King of Dublin,” says Tom, “I’ve quarter your daughter.”",
        "And the king didn’t know whether he was glad or sorry, and all the\nblood in the princess’s heart run into her cheeks.",
        "So there was no more fighting that day, and Tom was invited to dine\nwith the royal family. Next day, Redhead told Tom of a wolf, the\nsize of a yearling heifer, that used to be serenading about the\nwalls, and eating people and cattle; and said what a pleasure it\nwould give the king to have it killed.",
        "“With all my heart,” says Tom; “send a jackeen to show me where he\nlives, and we’ll see how he behaves to a stranger.”",
        "The princess was not well pleased, for Tom looked a different person\nwith fine clothes and a nice green birredh over his long curly hair;\nand besides, he’d got one laugh out of her. However, the king gave\nhis consent; and in an hour and a half the horrible wolf was walking\ninto the palace-yard, and Tom a step or two behind, with his club on\nhis shoulder, just as a shepherd would be walking after a pet lamb.",
        "The king and queen and princess were safe up in their gallery, but\nthe officers and people of the court that wor padrowling about the\ngreat bawn, when they saw the big baste coming in, gave themselves\nup, and began to make for doors and gates; and the wolf licked his\nchops, as if he was saying, “Wouldn’t I enjoy a breakfast off a\ncouple of yez!”",
        "The king shouted out, “O Tom with the Goat-skin, take away that\nterrible wolf, and you must have all my daughter.”",
        "But Tom didn’t mind him a bit. He pulled out his flute and began to\nplay like vengeance; and dickens a man or boy in the yard but began\nshovelling away heel and toe, and the wolf himself was obliged to\nget on his hind legs and dance “Tatther Jack Walsh,” along with the\nrest. A good deal of the people got inside, and shut the doors, the\nway the hairy fellow wouldn’t pin them; but Tom kept playing, and\nthe outsiders kept dancing and shouting, and the wolf kept dancing\nand roaring with the pain his legs were giving him; and all the time\nhe had his eyes on Redhead, who was shut out along with the rest.\nWherever Redhead went, the wolf followed, and kept one eye on him\nand the other on Tom, to see if he would give him leave to eat him.\nBut Tom shook his head, and never stopped the tune, and Redhead\nnever stopped dancing and bawling, and the wolf dancing and roaring,\none leg up and the other down, and he ready to drop out of his\nstanding from fair tiresomeness.",
        "When the princess seen that there was no fear of any one being kilt,\nshe was so divarted by the stew that Redhead was in, that she gave\nanother great laugh; and well become Tom, out he cried, “King of\nDublin, I have two halves of your daughter.”",
        "“Oh, halves or alls,” says the king, “put away that divel of a wolf,\nand we’ll see about it.”",
        "So Tom put his flute in his pocket, and says he to the baste that\nwas sittin’ on his currabingo ready to faint, “Walk off to your\nmountain, my fine fellow, and live like a respectable baste; and if\never I find you come within seven miles of any town, I’ll–”",
        "He said no more, but spit in his fist, and gave a flourish of his\nclub. It was all the poor divel of a wolf wanted: he put his tail\nbetween his legs, and took to his pumps without looking at man or\nmortal, and neither sun, moon, or stars ever saw him in sight of\nDublin again.",
        "At dinner every one laughed but the foxy fellow; and sure enough he\nwas laying out how he’d settle poor Tom next day.",
        "“Well, to be sure!” says he, “King of Dublin, you are in luck.\nThere’s the Danes moidhering us to no end. Deuce run to Lusk wid\n’em! and if any one can save us from ’em, it is this gentleman with\nthe goat-skin. There is a flail hangin’ on the collar-beam, in hell,\nand neither Dane nor devil can stand before it.”",
        "“So,” says Tom to the king, “will you let me have the other half of\nthe princess if I bring you the flail?”",
        "“No, no,” says the princess; “I’d rather never be your wife than see\nyou in that danger.”",
        "But Redhead whispered and nudged Tom about how shabby it would look\nto reneague the adventure. So he asked which way he was to go, and\nRedhead directed him.",
        "Well, he travelled and travelled, till he came in sight of the walls\nof hell; and, bedad, before he knocked at the gates, he rubbed\nhimself over with the greenish ointment. When he knocked, a hundred\nlittle imps popped their heads out through the bars, and axed him\nwhat he wanted.",
        "“I want to speak to the big divel of all,” says Tom: “open the\ngate.”",
        "It wasn’t long till the gate was thrune open, and the Ould Boy\nreceived Tom with bows and scrapes, and axed his business.",
        "“My business isn’t much,” says Tom. “I only came for the loan of\nthat flail that I see hanging on the collar-beam, for the king of\nDublin to give a thrashing to the Danes.”",
        "“Well,” says the other, “the Danes is much better customers to me;\nbut since you walked so far I won’t refuse. Hand that flail,” says\nhe to a young imp; and he winked the far-off eye at the same time.\nSo, while some were barring the gates, the young devil climbed up,\nand took down the flail that had the handstaff and booltheen both\nmade out of red-hot iron. The little vagabond was grinning to think\nhow it would burn the hands o’ Tom, but the dickens a burn it made\non him, no more nor if it was a good oak sapling.",
        "“Thankee,” says Tom. “Now would you open the gate for a body, and\nI’ll give you no more trouble.”",
        "“Oh, tramp!” says Ould Nick; “is that the way? It is easier getting\ninside them gates than getting out again. Take that tool from him,\nand give him a dose of the oil of stirrup.”",
        "So one fellow put out his claws to seize on the flail, but Tom gave\nhim such a welt of it on the side of the head that he broke off one\nof his horns, and made him roar like a devil as he was. Well, they\nrushed at Tom, but he gave them, little and big, such a thrashing as\nthey didn’t forget for a while. At last says the ould thief of all,\nrubbing his elbow, “Let the fool out; and woe to whoever lets him in\nagain, great or small.”",
        "So out marched Tom, and away with him, without minding the shouting\nand cursing they kept up at him from the tops of the walls; and when\nhe got home to the big bawn of the palace, there never was such\nrunning and racing as to see himself and the flail. When he had his\nstory told, he laid down the flail on the stone steps, and bid no\none for their lives to touch it. If the king, and queen, and\nprincess, made much of him before, they made ten times more of him\nnow; but Redhead, the mean scruff-hound, stole over, and thought to\ncatch hold of the flail to make an end of him. His fingers hardly\ntouched it, when he let a roar out of him as if heaven and earth\nwere coming together, and kept flinging his arms about and dancing,\nthat it was pitiful to look at him. Tom run at him as soon as he\ncould rise, caught his hands in his own two, and rubbed them this\nway and that, and the burning pain left them before you could reckon\none. Well the poor fellow, between the pain that was only just gone,\nand the comfort he was in, had the comicalest face that you ever\nsee, it was such a mixtherum-gatherum of laughing and crying.\nEverybody burst out a laughing–the princess could not stop no more\nthan the rest; and then says Tom, “Now, ma’am, if there were fifty\nhalves of you, I hope you’ll give me them all.”",
        "Well, the princess looked at her father, and by my word, she came\nover to Tom, and put her two delicate hands into his two rough ones,\nand I wish it was myself was in his shoes that day!",
        "Tom would not bring the flail into the palace. You may be sure no\nother body went near it; and when the early risers were passing next\nmorning, they found two long clefts in the stone, where it was after\nburning itself an opening downwards, nobody could tell how far. But\na messenger came in at noon, and said that the Danes were so\nfrightened when they heard of the flail coming into Dublin, that\nthey got into their ships, and sailed away.",
        "Well, I suppose, before they were married, Tom got some man, like\nPat Mara of Tomenine, to learn him the “principles of politeness,\"\nfluxions, gunnery, and fortification, decimal fractions, practice,\nand the rule of three direct, the way he’d be able to keep up a\nconversation with the royal family. Whether he ever lost his time\nlearning them sciences, I’m not sure, but it’s as sure as fate that\nhis mother never more saw any want till the end of her days.",

        "It may be as well to give the reader some account of the enormous\nextent of the Celtic folk-tales in existence. I reckon these to\nextend to 2000, though only about 250 are in print. The former\nnumber exceeds that known in France, Italy, Germany, and Russia,\nwhere collection has been most active, and is only exceeded by the\nMS. collection of Finnish folk-tales at Helsingfors, said to exceed\n12,000. As will be seen, this superiority of the Celts is due to the\nphenomenal and patriotic activity of one man, the late J. F.\nCampbell, of Islay, whose Popular Tales and MS. collections\n(partly described by Mr. Alfred Nutt in Folk-Lore, i. 369-83)\ncontain references to no less than 1281 tales (many of them, of\ncourse, variants and scraps). Celtic folk-tales, while more\nnumerous, are also the oldest of the tales of modern European races;\nsome of them–e.g., “Connla,” in the present selection,\noccurring in the oldest Irish vellums. They include (1) fairy tales\nproperly so-called–i.e., tales or anecdotes about fairies,\nhobgoblins, &c., told as natural occurrences; (2) hero-tales, stories\nof adventure told of national or mythical heroes; (3) folk-tales proper,\ndescribing marvellous adventures of otherwise unknown heroes,\nin which there is a defined plot and supernatural characters\n(speaking animals, giants, dwarfs, &c.); and finally (4) drolls, comic\nanecdotes of feats of stupidity or cunning.",
        "The collection of Celtic folk-tales began in IRELAND as early as\n1825, with T. Crofton Croker’s Fairy Legends and Traditions of\nthe South of Ireland. This contained some 38 anecdotes of the\nfirst class mentioned above, anecdotes showing the belief of the\nIrish peasantry in the existence of fairies, gnomes, goblins, and\nthe like. The Grimms did Croker the honour of translating part of\nhis book, under the title of Irische Elfenmärchen. Among the\nnovelists and tale-writers of the schools of Miss Edgeworth and\nLever folk-tales were occasionally utilised, as by Carleton in his\nTraits and Stories, by S. Lover in his Legends and Stories,\nand by G. Griffin in his Tales of a Jury-Room. These all tell their tales\nin the manner of the stage Irishman. Chapbooks, Royal Fairy Tales\nand Hibernian Tales, also contained genuine folk-tales, and attracted\nThackeray’s attention in his Irish Sketch-Book. The Irish Grimm,\nhowever, was Patrick Kennedy, a Dublin bookseller, who believed in\nfairies, and in five years (1866- 71) printed about 100 folk- and hero-\ntales and drolls (classes 2, 3, and 4 above) in his Legendary Fictions\nof the Irish Celts, 1866, Fireside Stories of Ireland, 1870, and Bardic\nStories of Ireland, 1871; all three are now unfortunately out of print. He\ntells his stories neatly and with spirit, and retains much that is\nvolkstümlich in his diction. He derived his materials from the\nEnglish-speaking peasantry of county Wexford, who changed from\nGaelic to English while story-telling was in full vigour, and therefore\ncarried over the stories with the change of language. Lady Wylde\nhas told many folk-tales very effectively in her Ancient Legends of\nIreland, 1887. More recently two collectors have published stories\ngathered from peasants of the West and North who can only speak\nGaelic. These are by an American gentleman named Curtin, Myths\nand Folk-Tales of Ireland, 1890; while Dr. Douglas Hyde has\npublished in Beside the Fireside, 1891, spirited English versions of\nsome of the stories he had published in the original Irish in his Leabhar\nSgeulaighteachta, Dublin, 1889. Miss Maclintoch has a large MS.\ncollection, part of which has appeared in various periodicals; and\nMessrs. Larminie and D. Fitzgerald are known to have much story\nmaterial in their possession.",
        "But beside these more modern collections there exist in old and\nmiddle Irish a large number of hero-tales (class 2) which formed\nthe staple of the old ollahms or bards. Of these tales of\n\"cattle-liftings, elopements, battles, voyages, courtships, caves,\nlakes, feasts, sieges, and eruptions,” a bard of even the fourth\nclass had to know seven fifties, presumably one for each day of the\nyear. Sir William Temple knew of a north-country gentleman of\nIreland who was sent to sleep every evening with a fresh tale\nfrom his bard. The Book of Leinster, an Irish vellum of the\ntwelfth century, contains a list of 189 of these hero-tales, many of\nwhich are extant to this day; E. O’Curry gives the list in the\nAppendix to his MS. Materials of Irish History. Another list\nof about 70 is given in the preface to the third volume of the\nOssianic Society’s publications. Dr. Joyce published a few of the\nmore celebrated of these in Old Celtic Romances; others\nappeared in Atlantis (see notes on “Deirdre”), others in\nKennedy’s Bardic Stories, mentioned above.",
        "Turning to SCOTLAND, we must put aside Chambers’ Popular Rhymes\nof Scotland, 1842, which contains for the most part folk-tales\ncommon with those of England rather than those peculiar to the\nGaelic-speaking Scots. The first name here in time as in importance\nis that of J. F. Campbell, of Islay. His four volumes, Popular\nTales of the West Highlands (Edinburgh, 1860-2, recently\nrepublished by the Islay Association), contain some 120 folk- and\nhero-tales, told with strict adherence to the language of the\nnarrators, which is given with a literal, a rather too literal,\nEnglish version. This careful accuracy has given an un-English air\nto his versions, and has prevented them attaining their due\npopularity. What Campbell has published represents only a tithe of\nwhat he collected. At the end of the fourth volume he gives a list\nof 791 tales, &c., collected by him or his assistants in the two\nyears 1859-61; and in his MS. collections at Edinburgh are two other\nlists containing 400 more tales. Only a portion of these are in the\nAdvocates’ Library; the rest, if extant, must be in private hands,\nthough they are distinctly of national importance and interest.",
        "Campbell’s influence has been effective of recent years in Scotland.\nThe Celtic Magazine (vols. xii. and xiii.), while under the\neditorship of Mr. MacBain, contained several folk- and hero-tales in\nGaelic, and so did the Scotch Celtic Review. These were from\nthe collections of Messrs. Campbell of Tiree, Carmichael, and K.\nMackenzie. Recently Lord Archibald Campbell has shown laudable\ninterest in the preservation of Gaelic folk- and hero-tales. Under\nhis auspices a whole series of handsome volumes, under the general\ntitle of Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition, has been\nrecently published, four volumes having already appeared, each\naccompanied by notes by Mr. Alfred Nutt, which form the most\nimportant aid to the study of Celtic Folk-Tales since Campbell\nhimself. Those to the second volume in particular (Tales collected\nby Rev. D. MacInnes) fill 100 pages, with condensed information on\nall aspects of the subject dealt with in the light of the most\nrecent research in the European folk-tales as well as on Celtic\nliterature. Thanks to Mr. Nutt, Scotland is just now to the fore in\nthe collection and study of the British Folk-Tale.",
        "WALES makes a poor show beside Ireland and Scotland. Sikes’\nBritish Goblins, and the tales collected by Prof. Rhys in\nY Cymrodor, vols. ii.-vi., are mainly of our first-class\nfairy anecdotes. Borrow, in his Wild Wales, refers to a\ncollection of fables in a journal called The Greal, while the\nCambrian Quarterly Magazine for 1830 and 1831 contained a few\nfairy anecdotes, including a curious version of the “Brewery of\nEggshells” from the Welsh. In the older literature, the Iolo\nMS., published by the Welsh MS. Society, has a few fables and\napologues, and the charming Mabinogion, translated by Lady\nGuest, has tales that can trace back to the twelfth century and are\non the border-line between folk-tales and hero-tales.",
        "CORNWALL and MAN are even worse than Wales. Hunt’s Drolls from\nthe West of England has nothing distinctively Celtic, and it is\nonly by a chance Lhuyd chose a folk-tale as his specimen of Cornish\nin his Archaeologia Britannica, 1709 (see Tale of Ivan).\nThe Manx folk-tales published, including the most recent by Mr. Moore,\nin his Folk-Lore of the Isle of Man, 1891, are mainly fairy\nanecdotes and legends.",
        "From this survey of the field of Celtic folk-tales it is clear that\nIreland and Scotland provide the lion’s share. The interesting thing\nto notice is the remarkable similarity of Scotch and Irish folk-\ntales. The continuity of language and culture between these two\ndivisions of Gaeldom has clearly brought about this identity of\ntheir folk-tales. As will be seen from the following notes, the\ntales found in Scotland can almost invariably be paralleled by those\nfound in Ireland, and vice versa. This result is a striking\nconfirmation of the general truth that folk-lores of different\ncountries resemble one another in proportion to their contiguity and\nto the continuity of language and culture between them.",
        "Another point of interest in these Celtic folk-tales is the light\nthey throw upon the relation of hero-tales and folk-tales (classes 2\nand 3 above). Tales told of Finn of Cuchulain, and therefore coming\nunder the definition of hero-tales, are found elsewhere told of\nanonymous or unknown heroes. The question is, were the folk-tales\nthe earliest, and were they localised and applied to the heroes, or\nwere the heroic sagas generalised and applied to an unknown [Greek:\ntis]? All the evidence, in my opinion, inclines to the former view,\nwhich, as applied to Celtic folk-tales, is of very great literary\nimportance; for it is becoming more and more recognised, thanks\nchiefly to the admirable work of Mr. Alfred Nutt, in his Studies\non the Holy Grail, that the outburst of European Romance in the\ntwelfth century was due, in large measure, to an infusion of Celtic\nhero-tales into the literature of the Romance-speaking nations. Now\nthe remarkable thing is, how these hero tales have lingered on in\noral tradition even to the present day. (See a marked case in\n\"Deirdre.”) We may, therefore, hope to see considerable light thrown\non the most characteristic spiritual product of the Middle Ages, the\nliterature of Romance and the spirit of chivalry, from the Celtic\nfolk-tales of the present day. Mr. Alfred Nutt has already shown\nthis to be true of a special section of Romance literature, that\nconnected with the Holy Grail, and it seems probable that further\nstudy will extend the field of application of this new method of\nresearch.",
        "The Celtic folk-tale again has interest in retaining many traits of\nprimitive conditions among the early inhabitants of these isles\nwhich are preserved by no other record. Take, for instance, the calm\nassumption of polygamy in “Gold Tree and Silver Tree.” That\nrepresents a state of feeling that is decidedly pre-Christian. The\nbelief in an external soul “Life Index,” recently monographed by Mr.\nFrazer in his “Golden Bough,” also finds expression in a couple of\nthe Tales (see notes on “Sea-Maiden” and “Fair, Brown, and\nTrembling”), and so with many other primitive ideas.",
        "Care, however, has to be taken in using folk-tales as evidence for\nprimitive practice among the nations where they are found. For the\ntales may have come from another race–that is, for example,\nprobably the case with “Gold Tree and Silver Tree” (see Notes).\nCeltic tales are of peculiar interest in this connection, as they\nafford one of the best fields for studying the problem of diffusion,\nthe most pressing of the problems of the folk-tales just at present,\nat least in my opinion. The Celts are at the furthermost end of\nEurope. Tales that travelled to them could go no further and must\ntherefore be the last links in the chain.",
        "For all these reasons, then, Celtic folk-tales are of high\nscientific interest to the folk-lorist, while they yield to none in\nimaginative and literary qualities. In any other country of Europe\nsome national means of recording them would have long ago been\nadopted. M. Luzel, e.g., was commissioned by the French\nMinister of Public Instruction to collect and report on the Breton\nfolk-tales. England, here as elsewhere without any organised means\nof scientific research in the historical and philological sciences,\nhas to depend on the enthusiasm of a few private individuals for\nwork of national importance. Every Celt of these islands or in the\nGaeldom beyond the sea, and every Celt-lover among the English-\nspeaking nations, should regard it as one of the duties of the race\nto put its traditions on record in the few years that now remain\nbefore they will cease for ever to be living in the hearts and\nmemories of the humbler members of the race.",
        "In the following Notes I have done as in my English Fairy\nTales, and given first, the sources whence I drew the tales,\nthen parallels at length for the British Isles, with bibliographical\nreferences for parallels abroad, and finally, remarks where the\ntales seemed to need them. In these I have not wearied or worried\nthe reader with conventional tall talk about the Celtic genius and its\nmanifestations in the folk-tale; on that topic one can only repeat\nMatthew Arnold when at his best, in his Celtic Literature. Nor have\nI attempted to deal with the more general aspects of the study of\nthe Celtic folk-tale. For these I must refer to Mr. Nutt’s series of\npapers in The Celtic Magazine, vol. xii., or, still better, to the\nmasterly introductions he is contributing to the series of Waifs and\nStrays of Celtic Tradition, and to Dr. Hyde’s Beside the\nFireside. In my remarks I have mainly confined myself to\ndiscussing the origin and diffusion of the various tales, so far as\nanything definite could be learnt or conjectured on that subject.",
        "Before proceeding to the Notes, I may “put in,” as the lawyers say,\na few summaries of the results reached in them. Of the twenty-six\ntales, twelve (i., ii., v., viii., ix., x., xi., xv., xvi., xvii.,\nxix., xxiv.) have Gaelic originals; three (vii., xiii., xxv.) are\nfrom the Welsh; one (xxii.) from the now extinct Cornish; one an\nadaptation of an English poem founded on a Welsh tradition (xxi.,\n\"Gellert”); and the remaining nine are what may be termed Anglo-\nIrish. Regarding their diffusion among the Celts, twelve are both\nIrish and Scotch (iv., v., vi., ix., x., xiv.-xvii., xix., xx.,\nxxiv); one (xxv.) is common to Irish and Welsh; and one (xxii.) to\nIrish and Cornish; seven are found only among the Celts in Ireland\n(i.-iii., xii., xviii., xxii., xxvi); two (viii., xi.) among the\nScotch; and three (vii., xiii., xxi.) among the Welsh. Finally, so\nfar as we can ascertain their origin, four (v., xvi., xxi., xxii.)\nare from the East; five (vi., x., xiv., xx., xxv.) are European\ndrolls; three of the romantic tales seem to have been imported\n(vii., ix., xix.); while three others are possibly Celtic\nexportations to the Continent (xv., xvii., xxiv.) though the, last\nmay have previously come thence; the remaining eleven are, as far as\nknown, original to Celtic lands. Somewhat the same result would come\nout, I believe, as the analysis of any representative collection of\nfolk-tales of any European district.",
        "Source.–From the old Irish “Echtra Condla chaim maic Cuind\nChetchathaig” of the Leabhar na h-Uidhre (\"Book of the Dun\nCow”), which must have been written before 1106, when its scribe\nMaelmori (\"Servant of Mary”) was murdered. The original is given by\nWindisch in his Irish Grammar, p. 120, also in the Trans.\nKilkenny Archaeol. Soc. for 1874. A fragment occurs in a\nRawlinson MS., described by Dr. W. Stokes, Tripartite Life,\np. xxxvi. I have used the translation of Prof. Zimmer in his\nKeltische Beiträge, ii. (Zeits. f. deutsches Altertum, Bd.\nxxxiii. 262-4). Dr. Joyce has a somewhat florid version in, his\nOld Celtic Romances, from which I have borrowed a touch or\ntwo. I have neither extenuated nor added aught but the last sentence\nof the Fairy Maiden’s last speech. Part of the original is in\nmetrical form, so that the whole is of the cante-fable species\nwhich I believe to be the original form of the folk-tale (Cf. Eng. Fairy\nTales, notes, p. 240, and infra, p. 257).",
        "Parallels.–Prof. Zimmer’s paper contains three other\naccounts of the terra repromissionis in the Irish sagas, one\nof them being the similar adventure of Cormac the nephew of Connla,\nor Condla Ruad as he should be called. The fairy apple of gold\noccurs in Cormac Mac Art’s visit to the Brug of Manannan (Nutt’s\nHoly Grail, 193).",
        "Remarks.–Conn the hundred-fighter had the head-kingship of\nIreland 123-157 A.D., according to the Annals of the Four\nMasters, i. 105. On the day of his birth the five great roads\nfrom Tara to all parts of Ireland were completed: one of them from\nDublin is still used. Connaught is said to have been named after\nhim, but this is scarcely consonant with Joyce’s identification with\nPtolemy’s Nagnatai (Irish Local Names, i. 75). But there\ncan be little doubt of Conn’s existence as a powerful ruler in\nIreland in the second century. The historic existence of Connla\nseems also to be authenticated by the reference to him as Conly, the\neldest son of Conn, in the Annals of Clonmacnoise. As Conn was\nsucceeded by his third son, Art Enear, Connla was either slain or\ndisappeared during his father’s lifetime. Under these circumstances\nit is not unlikely that our legend grew up within the century after\nConn–i.e., during the latter half of the second century.",
        "As regards the present form of it, Prof. Zimmer (l.c. 261-2)\nplaces it in the seventh century. It has clearly been touched up by\na Christian hand who introduced the reference to the day of judgment\nand to the waning power of the Druids. But nothing turns upon this\ninterpolation, so that it is likely that even the present form of\nthe legend is pre-Christian-i.e. for Ireland, pre-Patrician,\nbefore the fifth century.",
        "The tale of Connla is thus the earliest fairy tale of modern Europe.\nBesides this interest it contains an early account of one of the\nmost characteristic Celtic conceptions, that of the earthly\nParadise, the Isle of Youth, Tir-nan-Og. This has impressed\nitself on the European imagination; in the Arthuriad it is\nrepresented by the Vale of Avalon, and as represented in the various\nCeltic visions of the future life, it forms one of the main sources\nof Dante’s Divina Commedia. It is possible too, I think, that\nthe Homeric Hesperides and the Fortunate Isles of the ancients had a\nCeltic origin (as is well known, the early place-names of Europe are\npredominantly Celtic). I have found, I believe, a reference to the\nconception in one of the earliest passages in the classics dealing\nwith the Druids. Lucan, in his Pharsalia (i. 450-8), addresses\nthem in these high terms of reverence:",
        "  Et vos barbaricos ritus, moremque sinistrum,\n  Sacrorum, Druidae, positis repetistis ab armis,\n  Solis nosse Deos et coeli numera vobis\n  Aut solis nescire datum; nemora alta remotis\n  Incolitis lucis. Vobis auctoribus umbrae,\n  Non tacitas Erebi sedes, Ditisque profundi,\n  Pallida regna petunt: regit idem spiritus artus\n  Orbe alio: longae, canitis si cognita, vitae\n  Mors media est.",
        "The passage certainly seems to me to imply a different conception\nfrom the ordinary classical views of the life after death, the dark\nand dismal plains of Erebus peopled with ghosts; and the passage I\nhave italicised would chime in well with the conception of a\ncontinuance of youth (idem spiritus) in Tir-nan-Og (orbe\nalio).",
        "One of the most pathetic, beautiful, and typical scenes in Irish\nlegend is the return of Ossian from Tir-nan-Og, and his interview\nwith St. Patrick. The old faith and the new, the old order of things\nand that which replaced it, meet in two of the most characteristic\nproducts of the Irish imagination (for the Patrick of legend is as\nmuch a legendary figure as Oisin himself). Ossian had gone away to\nTir-nan-Og with the fairy Niamh under very much the same\ncircumstances as Condla Ruad; time flies in the land of eternal\nyouth, and when Ossian returns, after a year as he thinks, more than\nthree centuries had passed, and St. Patrick had just succeeded in\nintroducing the new faith. The contrast of Past and Present has\nnever been more vividly or beautifully represented.",
        "Source.–From Dr. Douglas Hyde’s Beside the Fire, 104-\n28, where it is a translation from the same author’s Leabhar\nSgeulaighteachta. Dr Hyde got it from one Shamus O’Hart, a\ngamekeeper of Frenchpark. One is curious to know how far the very\nbeautiful landscapes in the story are due to Dr. Hyde, who confesses\nto have only taken notes. I have omitted a journey to Rome,\nparalleled, as Mr. Nutt has pointed out, by the similar one of\nMichael Scott (Waifs and Strays, i. 46), and not bearing on\nthe main lines of the story. I have also dropped a part of Guleesh’s\nname: in the original he is “Guleesh na guss dhu,” Guleesh of the\nblack feet, because he never washed them; nothing turns on this in\nthe present form of the story, but one cannot but suspect it was of\nimportance in the original form.",
        "Parallels.–Dr. Hyde refers to two short stories, “Midnight\nRide” (to Rome) and “Stolen Bride,” in Lady Wilde’s Ancient\nLegends. But the closest parallel is given by Miss Maclintock’s\nDonegal tale of “Jamie Freel and the Young Lady,” reprinted in Mr.\nYeats’ Irish Folk and Fairy Tales, 52-9. In the Hibernian\nTales, “Mann o’ Malaghan and the Fairies,” as reported by\nThackeray in the Irish Sketch-Book, c. xvi., begins like\n\"Guleesh.”",
        "Source.–T. Crofton Croker’s Fairy Legends of the South of\nIreland, ed. Wright, pp. 135-9. In the original the gnome is a\nCluricaune, but as a friend of Mr. Batten’s has recently heard the\ntale told of a Lepracaun, I have adopted the better known title.",
        "Remarks.–Lepracaun is from the Irish leith\nbhrogan, the one-shoemaker (cf. brogue), according to Dr.\nHyde. He is generally seen (and to this day, too) working at a\nsingle shoe, cf. Croker’s story “Little Shoe,” l.c. pp. 142-4.\nAccording to a writer in the Revue Celtique, i. 256, the true\netymology is luchor pan, “little man.” Dr. Joyce also gives the same\netymology in Irish Names and Places, i. 183, where he mentions\nseveral places named after them.",
        "Source.–Lady Wilde’s Ancient Legends, the first\nstory.",
        "Parallels.–A similar version was given by Mr. D. Fitzgerald\nin the Revue Celtique, iv. 181, but without the significant\nand impressive horns. He refers to Cornhill for February\n1877, and to Campbell’s “Sauntraigh” No. xxii. Pop. Tales,\nii. 52 4, in which a “woman of peace” (a fairy) borrows a woman’s\nkettle and returns it with flesh in it, but at last the woman\nrefuses, and is persecuted by the fairy. I fail to see much analogy.\nA much closer one is in Campbell, ii. p. 63, where fairies are got\nrid of by shouting “Dunveilg is on fire.” The familiar “lady-bird,\nlady-bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children at\nhome,” will occur to English minds. Another version in Kennedy’s\nLegendary Fictions, p. 164, “Black Stairs on Fire.”",
        "Remarks.–Slievenamon is a famous fairy palace in Tipperary\naccording to Dr. Joyce, l.c. i. 178. It was the hill on which\nFinn stood when he gave himself as the prize to the Irish maiden who\nshould run up it quickest. Grainne won him with dire consequences,\nas all the world knows or ought to know (Kennedy, Legend\nFict., 222, “How Fion selected a Wife”).",
        "Source.–Campbell, Pop. Tales of West Highlands, No.\nv. pp. 105-8, “Conall Cra Bhuidhe.” I have softened the third\nepisode, which is somewhat too ghastly in the original. I have\ntranslated “Cra Bhuide” Yellowclaw on the strength of Campbell’s\netymology, l.c. p. 158.",
        "Parallels.–Campbell’s vi. and vii. are two variants showing\nhow widespread the story is in Gaelic Scotland. It occurs in Ireland\nwhere it has been printed in the chapbook, Hibernian Tales,\nas the “Black Thief and the Knight of the Glen,” the Black Thief\nbeing Conall, and the knight corresponding to the King of Lochlan\n(it is given in Mr. Lang’s Red Fairy Book). Here it attracted\nthe notice of Thackeray, who gives a good abstract of it in his\nIrish Sketch-Book, ch. xvi. He thinks it “worthy of the\nArabian Nights, as wild and odd as an Eastern tale.” “That\nfantastical way of bearing testimony to the previous tale by\nproducing an old woman who says the tale is not only true, but who\nwas the very old woman who lived in the giant’s castle is almost\"\n(why “almost,” Mr. Thackeray?) “a stroke of genius.” The incident of\nthe giant’s breath occurs in the story of Koisha Kayn, MacInnes’\nTales, i. 241, as well as the Polyphemus one, ibid. 265.\nOne-eyed giants are frequent in Celtic folk-tales (e.g. in The\nPursuit of Diarmaid and in the Mabinogi of Owen).",
        "Remarks.–Thackeray’s reference to the “Arabian Nights” is\nespecially apt, as the tale of Conall is a framework story like\nThe 1001 Nights, the three stories told by Conall being\nframed, as it were, in a fourth which is nominally the real story.\nThis method employed by the Indian story-tellers and from them\nadopted by Boccaccio and thence into all European literatures\n(Chaucer, Queen Margaret, &c.), is generally thought to be peculiar\nto the East, and to be ultimately derived from the Jatakas or Birth\nStories of the Buddha who tells his adventures in former\nincarnations. Here we find it in Celtdom, and it occurs also in\n\"The Story-teller at Fault” in this collection, and the story\nof Koisha Kayn in MacInnes’ Argyllshire Tales, a variant\nof which, collected but not published by Campbell, has no less than\nnineteen tales enclosed in a framework. The question is whether the\nmethod was adopted independently in Ireland, or was due to foreign\ninfluences. Confining ourselves to “Conal Yellowclaw,” it seems not\nunlikely that the whole story is an importation. For the second\nepisode is clearly the story of Polyphemus from the Odyssey which\nwas known in Ireland perhaps as early as the tenth century (see\nProf. K. Meyer’s edition of Merugud Uilix maic Leirtis, Pref.\np. xii). It also crept into the voyages of Sindbad in the Arabian\nNights. And as told in the Highlands it bears comparison even\nwith the Homeric version. As Mr. Nutt remarks (Celt. Mag.\nxii.) the address of the giant to the buck is as effective as that\nof Polyphemus to his ram. The narrator, James Wilson, was a blind\nman who would naturally feel the pathos of the address; “it comes\nfrom the heart of the narrator;” says Campbell (l.c., 148),\n\"it is the ornament which his mind hangs on the frame of the story.”",
        "Source.–From oral tradition, by the late D. W. Logie, taken\ndown by Mr. Alfred Nutt.",
        "Parallels.–Lover has a tale, “Little Fairly,” obviously\nderived from this folk-tale; and there is another very similar,\n\"Darby Darly.” Another version of our tale is given under the title\n\"Donald and his Neighbours,” in the chapbook Hibernian Talesm\nwhence it was reprinted by Thackeray in his Irish Sketch-\nBook, c. xvi. This has the incident of the “accidental matricide,\"\non which see Prof. R. Köhler on Gonzenbach Sicil. Mährchen,\nii. 224. No less than four tales of Campbell are of this type\n(Pop. Tales, ii. 218-31). M. Cosquin, in his “Contes populaires\nde Lorraine,” the storehouse of “storiology,” has elaborate\nexcursuses in this class of tales attached to his Nos. x. and xx.\nMr. Clouston discusses it also in his Pop. Tales, ii. 229-88.\nBoth these writers are inclined to trace the chief incidents\nto India. It is to be observed that one of the earliest popular\ndrolls in Europe, Unibos, a Latin poem of the eleventh, and\nperhaps the tenth, century, has the main outlines of the story, the\nfraudulent sale of worthless objects and the escape from the sack\ntrick. The same story occurs in Straparola, the European earliest\ncollection of folk-tales in the sixteenth century. On the other\nhand, the gold sticking to the scales is familiar to us in Ali\nBaba. (Cf. Cosquin, l.c., i. 225-6, 229).",
        "Remarks.–It is indeed curious to find, as M. Cosquin points\nout, a cunning fellow tied in a sack getting out by crying, “I won’t\nmarry the princess,” in countries so far apart as Ireland, Sicily\n(Gonzenbach, No. 71), Afghanistan (Thorburn, Bannu, p. 184),\nand Jamaica (Folk-Lore Record, iii. 53). It is indeed impossible\nto think these are disconnected, and for drolls of this kind a good\ncase has been made out for the borrowing hypotheses by M. Cosquin\nand Mr. Clouston. Who borrowed from whom is another and more\ndifficult question which has to be judged on its merits in each\nindividual case.",
        "This is a type of Celtic folk-tales which are European in spread,\nhave analogies with the East, and can only be said to be Celtic by\nadoption and by colouring. They form a distinct section of the tales\ntold by the Celts, and must be represented in any characteristic\nselection. Other examples are xi., xv., xx., and perhaps xxii.",
        "Source.–Preface to the edition of “The Physicians of\nMyddvai\"; their prescription-book, from the Red Book of Hergest,\npublished by the Welsh MS. Society in 1861. The legend is not\ngiven in the Red Book, but from oral tradition by Mr. W. Rees, p. xxi.\nAs this is the first of the Welsh tales in this book it may be as well\nto give the reader such guidance as I can afford him on the\nintricacies of Welsh pronunciation, especially with regard to the\nmysterious w’s and y’s of Welsh orthography. For w substitute\ndouble o, as in “fool,” and for y, the short u in but,\nand as near approach to Cymric speech will be reached as is possible\nfor the outlander. It maybe added that double d equals th, and\ndouble l is something like Fl, as Shakespeare knew in calling\nhis Welsh soldier Fluellen (Llewelyn). Thus “Meddygon Myddvai\"\nwould be Anglicè “Methugon Muthvai.”",
        "Parallels.–Other versions of the legend of the Van Pool are\ngiven in Cambro-Briton, ii. 315; W. Sikes, British Goblins,\np. 40. Mr. E. Sidney Hartland has discussed these and others\nin a set of papers contributed to the first volume of The\nArchaeological Review (now incorporated into Folk-Lore),\nthe substance of which is now given in his Science of Fairy\nTales, 274-332. (See also the references given in Revue\nCeltique, iv., 187 and 268). Mr. Hartland gives there an\necumenical collection of parallels to the several incidents that go\nto make up our story–(1) The bride-capture of the Swan-Maiden, (2)\nthe recognition of the bride, (3) the taboo against causeless blows,\n(4) doomed to be broken, and (5) disappearance of the Swan-Maiden,\nwith (6) her return as Guardian Spirit to her descendants. In each\ncase Mr. Hartland gives what he considers to be the most primitive\nform of the incident. With reference to our present tale, he comes\nto the conclusion, if I understand him aright, that the lake-maiden\nwas once regarded as a local divinity. The physicians of Myddvai\nwere historic personages, renowned for their medical skill for some\nsix centuries, till the race died out with John Jones, fl.\n1743. To explain their skill and uncanny knowledge of herbs, the\nfolk traced them to a supernatural ancestress, who taught them their\ncraft in a place still called Pant-y-Meddygon (\"Doctors’ Dingle”).\nTheir medical knowledge did not require any such remarkable origin,\nas Mr. Hartland has shown in a paper “On Welsh Folk-Medicine,\"\ncontributed to Y Cymmrodor, vol. xii. On the other hand, the\nSwan-Maiden type of story is widespread through the Old World. Mr.\nMorris’ “Land East of the Moon and West of the Sun,” in The\nEarthly Paradise, is taken from the Norse version. Parallels are\naccumulated by the Grimms, ii. 432; Köhler on Gonzenbach, ii. 20;\nor Blade, 149; Stokes’ Indian Fairy Tales, 243, 276; and\nMessrs. Jones and Koopf, Magyar Folk-Tales, 362-5. It remains\nto be proved that one of these versions did not travel to Wales, and\nbecome there localised. We shall see other instances of such\nlocalisation or specialisation of general legends.",

See\n\"Connla” here, and other examples given by Mr. Nutt in his notes to\nMacInnes’ Tales.

        "Remarks.–The “Story of Deirdre” is a remarkable instance of\nthe tenacity of oral tradition among the Celts. It has been\npreserved in no less than five versions (or six, including\nMacpherson’s “Darthula”) ranging from the twelfth to the nineteenth\ncentury. The earliest is in the twelfth century, Book of\nLeinster, to be dated about 1140 (edited in facsimile under the\nauspices of the Royal Irish Academy, i. 147, seq.). Then\ncomes a fifteenth century version, edited and translated by\nDr. Stokes in Windisch’s Irische Texte II., ii. 109, seq.,\n\"Death of the Sons of Uisnech.” Keating in his History of\nIreland gave another version in the seventeenth century. The\nDublin Gaelic Society published an eighteenth century version in\ntheir Transactions for 1808. And lastly we have the version\nbefore us, collected only a few years ago, yet agreeing in all\nessential details with the version of the Book of Leinster.\nSuch a record is unique in the history of oral tradition, outside\nIreland, where, however, it is quite a customary experience in the\nstudy of the Finn-saga. It is now recognised that Macpherson had, or\ncould have had, ample material for his rechauffé of the Finn\nor “Fingal” saga. His “Darthula” is a similar cobbling of our\npresent story. I leave to Celtic specialists the task of settling\nthe exact relations of these various texts. I content myself with\npointing out the fact that in these latter days of a seemingly\nprosaic century in these British Isles there has been collected from\nthe lips of the folk a heroic story like this of “Deirdre,” full of\nromantic incidents, told with tender feeling and considerable\nliterary skill. No other country in Europe, except perhaps Russia,\ncould provide a parallel to this living on of Romance among the\ncommon folk. Surely it is a bounden duty of those who are in the\nposition to put on record any such utterances of the folk-\nimagination of the Celts before it is too late.",

        "Parallels.–Two English versions are given in my Eng.\nFairy Tales, No. iv., “The Old Woman and her Pig,” and xxxiv.,\n\"The Cat and the Mouse,” where see notes for other variants in these\nisles.  M. Cosquin, in his notes to No. xxxiv., of his Contes\nde Lorraine, t. ii. pp. 35-41, has drawn attention to an\nastonishing number of parallels scattered through all Europe and\nthe East (cf., too, Crane, Ital. Pop. Tales, notes, 372-5).\nOne of the earliest allusions to the jingle is in Don Quixote,\npt. 1, c. xvi.: “Y asi como suele decirse el gato al rato, et rato á\nla cuerda, la cuerda al palo, daba el arriero á Sancho, Sancho\ná la moza, la moza á él, el ventero á la moza.” As I have pointed\nout, it is used to this day by Bengali women at the end of each\nfolk-tale they recite (L. B. Day, Folk-Tales of Bengal, Pref.).",
        "Remarks.–Two ingenious suggestions have been made as to the\norigin of this curious jingle, both connecting it with religious\nceremonies: (1) Something very similar occurs in Chaldaic at the end\nof the Jewish Hagada, or domestic ritual for the Passover\nnight. It has, however, been shown that this does not occur in early\nMSS. or editions, and was only added at the end to amuse the\nchildren after the service, and was therefore only a translation or\nadaptation of a current German form of the jingle; (2) M. Basset, in\nthe Revue des Traditions populaires, 1890, t. v. p. 549, has\nsuggested that it is a survival of the old Greek custom at the\nsacrifice of the Bouphonia for the priest to contend that he\nhad not slain the sacred beast, the axe declares that the handle did\nit, the handle transfers the guilt further, and so on. This is\ningenious, but fails to give any reasonable account of the diffusion\nof the jingle in countries which have had no historic connection\nwith classical Greece.",

No other version is known\nin the British Isles.",
        "Remarks.–It is unlikely, I should say impossible, that this\ntale, with the incident of the dormant heroine, should have arisen\nindependently in the Highlands; it is most likely an importation\nfrom abroad. Yet in it occurs a most “primitive” incident, the\nbigamous household of the hero; this is glossed over in Mr.\nMacleod’s other variant. On the “survival\" method of investigation\nthis would possibly be used as evidence for polygamy in the\nHighlands. Yet if, as is probable, the story came from abroad, this\ntrait may have come with it, and only implies polygamy in the\noriginal home of the tale.",

        "Parallels.–Prof. Rhys, Hibbert Lectures, p. 486,\nconsiders that our tale is paralleled by Cuchulain’s “Wooing of\nEmer,” a translation of which by Prof. K. Meyer appeared in the\nArchaeological Review, vol. i. I fail to see much analogy. On\nthe other hand in his Arthurian Legend, p. 41, he rightly\ncompares the tasks set by Yspythadon to those set to Jason. They are\nindeed of the familiar type of the Bride Wager (on which see Grimm-\nHunt, i. 399). The incident of the three animals, old, older, and\noldest, has a remarkable resemblance to the Tettira Jataka\n(ed. Fausböll, No. 37, transl. Rhys Davids, i. p. 310 seq.)\nin which the partridge, monkey, and elephant dispute as to their\nrelative age, and the partridge turns out to have voided the seed of\nthe Banyan-tree under which they were sheltered, whereas the\nelephant only knew it when a mere bush, and the monkey had nibbled\nthe topmost shoots. This apologue got to England at the end of the\ntwelfth century as the sixty-ninth fable, “Wolf, Fox, and Dove,” of\na rhymed prose collection of “Fox Fables” (Mishle Shu’alim),\nof an Oxford Jew, Berachyah Nakdan, known in the Records as\n\"Benedict le Puncteur” (see my Fables Of Aesop, i. p. 170).\nSimilar incidents occur in “Jack and his Snuff-box” in my English\nFairy Tales, and in Dr. Hyde’s “Well of D’Yerree-in-Dowan.” The\nskilled companions of Kulhwych are common in European folk-tales\n(Cf. Cosquin, i. 123-5), and especially among the Celts (see\nMr. Nutt’s note in MacInnes’ Tales, 445-8), among whom they\noccur very early, but not so early as Lynceus and the other skilled\ncomrades of the Argonauts.",
        "Remarks.–The hunting of the boar Trwyth can be traced back\nin Welsh tradition at least as early as the ninth century. For it is\nreferred to in the following passage of Nennius’ Historia\nBritonum ed. Stevenson, p: 60, “Est aliud miraculum in regione\nquae dicitur Buelt [Builth, co. Brecon] Est ibi cumulus lapidum et\nunus lapis super-positus super congestum cum vestigia canis in eo.\nQuando venatus est porcum Troynt [var. lec. Troit] impressit\nCabal, qui erat canis Arthuri militis, vestigium in lapide et Arthur\npostea congregavit congestum lapidum sub lapide in quo erat\nvestigium canis sui et vocatur Carn Cabal.” Curiously enough there\nis still a mountain called Carn Cabal in the district of Builth,\nsouth of Rhayader Gwy in Breconshire. Still more curiously a friend\nof Lady Guest’s found on this a cairn with a stone two feet long by\none foot wide in which there was an indentation 4 in. x 3 in. x 2\nin. which could easily have been mistaken for a paw-print of a dog,\nas maybe seen from the engraving given of it (Mabinogion, ed. 1874,\np. 269).",
        "The stone and the legend are thus at least one thousand years old.\n\"There stands the stone to tell if I lie.” According to Prof. Rhys\n(Hibbert Lect. 486-97) the whole story is a mythological one,\nKulhwych’s mother being the dawn, the clover blossoms that grow\nunder Olwen’s feet being comparable to the roses that sprung up\nwhere Aphrodite had trod, and Yspyddadon being the incarnation of\nthe sacred hawthorn. Mabon, again (i.e. pp. 21, 28-9), is the\nApollo Maponus discovered in Latin inscriptions at Ainstable in\nCumberland and elsewhere (Hübner, Corp. Insc. Lat. Brit. Nos.\n218, 332, 1345). Granting all this, there is nothing to show any\nmythological significance in the tale, though there may have been\nin the names of the dramatis personae. I observe from the\nproceedings of the recent Eisteddfod that the bardic name of Mr. W.\nAbraham, M.P., is ’Mabon.’ It scarcely follows that Mr. Abraham is\nin receipt of divine honours nowadays.",

Indeed, Mr.\nNutt is inclined to think that the original form of our story (which\ncontains a mysterious healing vessel) is the germ out of which the\nlegend of the Holy Grail was evolved (see his Studies in the Holy\nGrail, p. 202 seq.).",

        "Parallels.–Campbell gives another variant, l.c. i.\n318. Dr. Hyde has an Irish version of Campbell’s tale written down\nin 1762, from which he gives the incident of the air-ladder (which\nI have had to euphemise in my version) in his Beside the\nFireside, p. 191, and other passages in his Preface. The most\nremarkable parallel to this incident, however, is afforded by the\nfeats of Indian jugglers reported briefly by Marco Polo, and\nillustrated with his usual wealth of learning by the late Sir Henry\nYule, in his edition, vol. i. p. 308 seq. The accompanying\nillustration (reduced from Yule) will tell its own tale: it is taken\nfrom the Dutch account of the travels of an English sailor, E.\nMelton, Zeldzaame Reizen, 1702, p. 468. It tells the tale in\nfive acts, all included in one sketch. Another instance quoted by\nYule is still more parallel, so to speak. The twenty-third trick\nperformed by some conjurors before the Emperor Jahangueir\n(Memoirs, p. 102) is thus described: “They produced a chain\nof 50 cubits in length, and in my presence threw one end of it\ntowards the sky, where it remained as if fastened to something in\nthe air. A dog was then brought forward, and being placed at the\nlower end of the chain, immediately ran up, and, reaching the other\nend, immediately disappeared in the air. In the same manner a hog, a\npanther, a lion, and a tiger were successively sent up the chain.\"\nIt has been suggested that the conjurors hypnotise the spectators,\nand make them believe they see these things. This is practically the\nsuggestion of a wise Mohammedan, who is quoted by Yule as saying,\n”Wallah! ’tis my opinion there has been neither going up nor\ncoming down; ’tis all hocus-pocus,” hocus-pocus being presumably the\nMohammedan term for hypnotism.",
        "Remarks.–Dr. Hyde (l.c. Pref. xxix.) thinks our tale\ncannot be older than 1362, because of a reference to one O’Connor\nSligo which occurs in all its variants; it is, however, omitted in\nour somewhat abridged version. Mr Nutt (ap. Campbell, The\nFians, Introd. xix.) thinks that this does not prevent a still\nearlier version having existed. I should have thought that the\nexistence of so distinctly Eastern a trick in the tale, and the fact\nthat it is a framework story (another Eastern characteristic), would\nimply that it is a rather late importation, with local allusions\nsuperadded (cf. notes on “Conal Yellowclaw,” No v.)",
        "The passages in verse from pp 137, 139, and the description of the\nBeggarman, pp. 136, 140, are instances of a curious characteristic\nof Gaelic folk-tales called “runs.” Collections of conventional\nepithets are used over and over again to describe the same incident,\nthe beaching of a boat, sea-faring, travelling and the like, and are\ninserted in different tales. These “runs” are often similar in both\nthe Irish and the Scotch form of the same tale or of the same\nincident. The volumes of Waifs and Strays contain numerous\nexamples of these “runs,” which have been indexed in each volume.\nThese “runs” are another confirmation of my view that the original\nform of the folk-tale was that of the Cante-fable (see note\non “Connla” and on “Childe Rowland” in English Fairy Tales).",
        "Source.–Campbell, Pop. Tales, No. 4. I have omitted\nthe births of the animal comrades and transposed the carlin to the\nmiddle of the tale.

She had swallowed him).”",
        "Parallels.–The early part of the story occurs in No. xv.,\n\"Shee an Gannon,” and the last part in No. xix., “Fair, Brown, and\nTrembling” (both from Curtin), Campbell’s No. 1. “The Young King” is\nmuch like it; also MacInnes’ No. iv., “Herding of Cruachan” and No.\nviii., “Lod the Farmer’s Son.” The third of Mr. Britten’s Irish\nfolk-tales in the Folk-Lore Journal is a Sea-Maiden story.\nThe story is obviously a favourite one among the Celts. Yet its main\nincidents occur with frequency in Continental folk-tales. Prof.\nKöhler has collected a number in his notes on Campbell’s Tales in\nOrient und Occident, Bnd. ii. 115-8. The trial of the sword\noccurs in the saga of Sigurd, yet it is also frequent in Celtic saga\nand folk-tales (see Mr. Nutt’s note, MacInnes’ Tales, 473,\nand add. Curtin, 320). The hideous carlin and her three giant sons\nis also a common form in Celtic. The external soul of the Sea-Maiden\ncarried about in an egg, in a trout, in a hoodie, in a hind, is a\nremarkable instance of a peculiarly savage conception which has been\nstudied by Major Temple, Wide-awake Stories, 404-5; by Mr. E.\nClodd, in the “Philosophy of Punchkin,” in Folk-Lore Journal,\nvol. ii., and by Mr. Frazer in his Golden Bough, vol. ii.",
        "Remarks.–As both Prof. Rhys (Hibbert Lect., 464) and\nMr. Nutt (MacInnes’ Tales, 477) have pointed out, practically\nthe same story (that of Perseus and Andromeda) is told of the\nUltonian hero, Cuchulain, in the Wooing of Emer, a tale which\noccurs in the Book of Leinster, a MS. of the twelfth century, and\nwas probably copied from one of the eighth. Unfortunately it is not\ncomplete, and the Sea-Maiden incident is only to be found in a\nBritish Museum MS. of about 1300. In this Cuchulain finds that the\ndaughter of Ruad is to be given as a tribute to the Fomori, who,\naccording to Prof. Rhys, Folk-Lore, ii. 293, have something\nof the nightmare about their etymology. Cuchulain fights\nthree of them successively, has his wounds bound up by a\nstrip of the maiden’s garment, and then departs. Thereafter many\nboasted of having slain the Fomori, but the maiden believed them not\ntill at last by a stratagem she recognises Cuchulain. I may add to\nthis that in Mr. Curtin’s Myths, 330, the threefold trial of\nthe sword is told of Cuchulain. This would seem to trace our story\nback to the seventh or eighth century and certainly to the\nthirteenth. If so, it is likely enough that it spread from Ireland\nthrough Europe with the Irish missions (for the wide extent of which\nsee map in Mrs. Bryant’s Celtic Ireland). The very letters\nthat have spread through all Europe except Russia, are to be traced\nto the script of these Irish monks: why not certain folk-tales?\nThere is a further question whether the story was originally told of\nCuchulain as a hero-tale and then became departicularised as a folk-\ntale, or was the process vice versa. Certainly in the form in\nwhich it appears in the Tochmarc Emer it is not complete, so\nthat here, as elsewhere, we seem to have an instance of a folk-tale\napplied to a well-known heroic name, and becoming a hero-tale or\nsaga.",

(cf. however, MacDougall’s Tales, notes, 272).\nBesides, the grotesque form of the legend is enough to remove\nit from the region of the hero-tale. On the other hand, there is a\ndistinct reference to Finn’s wisdom-tooth, which presaged the future\nto him (on this see Revue Celtique, v. 201, Joyce, Old Celt.\nRom., 434-5, and MacDougall, l.c. 274).

        "Source.–I have paraphrased the well-known poem of Hon. W. R.\nSpencer, “Beth Gêlert, or the Grave of the Greyhound,” first printed\nprivately as a broadsheet in 1800 when it was composed (\"August 11,\n1800, Dolymalynllyn” is the colophon). It was published in Spencer’s\nPoems, 1811, pp. 78-86. These dates, it will be seen, are of\nimportance. Spencer states in a note: “The story of this ballad is\ntraditionary in a village at the foot of Snowdon where Llewellyn the\nGreat had a house. The Greyhound named Gêlert was given him by his\nfather-in-law, King John, in the year 1205, and the place to this\nday is called Beth-Gêlert, or the grave of Gêlert.” As a matter of\nfact, no trace of the tradition in connection with Bedd Gellert can\nbe found before Spencer’s time. It is not mentioned in Leland’s\nItinerary, ed. Hearne, v. p. 37 (\"Beth Kellarth”), in Pennant’s\nTour (1770), ii. 176, or in Bingley’s Tour in Wales (1800).\nBorrow in his Wild Wales, p. 146, gives the legend, but does\nnot profess to derive it from local tradition.",
        "Parallels.–The only parallel in Celtdom is that noticed by\nCroker in his third volume, the legend of Partholan who killed his\nwife’s greyhound from jealousy: this is found sculptured in stone at\nAp Brune, co. Limerick. As is well known, and has been elaborately\ndiscussed by Mr. Baring-Gould (Curious Myths of the Middle\nAges, p. 134 seq.), and Mr. W. A. Clouston (Popular Tales\nand Fictions, ii. 166, seq.), the story of the man who\nrashly slew the dog (ichneumon, weasel, &c.) that had saved his\nbabe from death, is one of those which have spread from East to\nWest. It is indeed, as Mr. Clouston points out, still current in\nIndia, the land of its birth. There is little doubt that it is\noriginally Buddhistic: the late Prof. S. Beal gave the earliest\nknown version from the Chinese translation of the Vinaya\nPitaka in the Academy of Nov. 4, 1882. The conception of\nan animal sacrificing itself for the sake of others is peculiarly\nBuddhistic; the “hare in the moon” is an apotheosis of such a piece\nof self-sacrifice on the part of Buddha (Sasa Jataka). There\nare two forms that have reached the West, the first being that of an\nanimal saving men at the cost of its own life. I pointed out an\nearly instance of this, quoted by a Rabbi of the second century, in\nmy Fables of Aesop, i. 105. This concludes with a strangely\nclose parallel to Gellert; “They raised a cairn over his grave,\nand the place is still called The Dog’s Grave.” The Culex\nattributed to Virgil seems to be another variant of this. The second\nform of the legend is always told as a moral apologue against\nprecipitate action, and originally occurred in The Fables of\nBidpai in its hundred and one forms, all founded on Buddhistic\noriginals (cf. Benfey, Pantschatantra, Einleitung, §201).\n[Footnote: It occurs in the same chapter as the story of La\nPerrette, which has been traced, after Benfey, by Prof. M. Müller in\nhis “Migration of Fables” (Sel. Essays, i. 500-74): exactly\nthe same history applies to Gellert.] Thence, according to Benfey,\nit was inserted in the Book of Sindibad, another collection\nof Oriental Apologues framed on what may be called the Mrs. Potiphar\nformula. This came to Europe with the Crusades, and is known in its\nWestern versions as the Seven Sages of Rome. The Gellert\nstory occurs in all the Oriental and Occidental versions;\ne.g., it is the First Master’s story in Wynkyn de Worde’s\n(ed. G. L. Gomme, for the Villon Society.) From the Seven\nSages it was taken into the particular branch of the Gesta\nRomanorum current in England and known as the English Gesta,\nwhere it occurs as c. xxxii., “Story of Folliculus.” We have thus traced\nit to England whence it passed to Wales, where I have discovered it as\nthe second apologue of “The Fables of Cattwg the Wise,” in the Iolo\nMS. published by the Welsh MS. Society, p.561, “The man who\nkilled his Greyhound.” (These Fables, Mr. Nutt informs me, are a\npseudonymous production probably of the sixteenth century.) This\nconcludes the literary route of the Legend of Gellert from India to\nWales: Buddhistic Vinaya Pitaka–Fables of Bidpai;–Oriental\nSindibad;–Occidental Seven Sages of Rome;–\"English” (Latin),\nGesta Romanorum;–Welsh, Fables of Cattwg.",
        "Remarks.–We have still to connect the legend with Llewelyn\nand with Bedd Gelert. But first it may be desirable to point out why\nit is necessary to assume that the legend is a legend and not a\nfact. The saving of an infant’s life by a dog, and the mistaken\nslaughter of the dog, are not such an improbable combination as to\nmake it impossible that the same event occurred in many places. But\nwhat is impossible, in my opinion, is that such an event should have\nindependently been used in different places as the typical instance\nof, and warning against, rash action. That the Gellert legend,\nbefore it was localised, was used as a moral apologue in Wales is\nshown by the fact that it occurs among the Fables of Cattwg, which\nare all of that character. It was also utilised as a proverb: “Yr\nwy’n edivaru cymmaint a’r Gwr a laddodd ei Vilgi” (\"I repent as\nmuch as the man who slew his greyhound”). The fable indeed, from\nthis point of view, seems greatly to have attracted the Welsh mind,\nperhaps as of especial value to a proverbially impetuous\ntemperament. Croker (Fairy Legends of Ireland, vol. iii. p.\n165) points out several places where the legend seems to have been\nlocalised in place-names–two places, called “Gwal y Vilast\"\n(\"Greyhound’s Couch”), in Carmarthen and Glamorganshire; “Llech y\nAsp” (\"Dog’s Stone”), in Cardigan, and another place named in Welsh\n\"Spring of the Greyhound’s Stone.” Mr. Baring-Gould mentions that\nthe legend is told of an ordinary tombstone, with a knight and a\ngreyhound, in Abergavenny Church; while the Fable of Cattwg is told\nof a man in Abergarwan. So widespread and well known was the legend\nthat it was in Richard III’s time adopted as the national crest. In\nthe Warwick Roll, at the Herald’s Office, after giving separate\ncrests for England, Scotland, and Ireland, that for Wales is given\nas figured in the margin, and blazoned “on a coronet in a cradle or,\na greyhound argent for Walys” (see J. R. Planché, Twelve Designs\nfor the Costume of Shakespeare’s Richard III., 1830, frontispiece).\nIf this Roll is authentic, the popularity of the legend is thrown back\ninto the fifteenth century. It still remains to explain how and when this\ngeneral legend of rash action was localised and specialised at Bedd\nGelert: I believe I have discovered this. There certainly was a local\nlegend about a dog named Gelert at that place; E. Jones, in the first\nedition of his Musical Relicks of the Welsh Bards, 1784, p. 40, gives\nthe following englyn or epigram:",
        "  Claddwyd Cylart celfydd (ymlyniad)\n    Ymlaneau Efionydd\n  Parod giuio i’w gynydd\n    Parai’r dydd yr heliai Hydd;",
        "which he Englishes thus:",
        "  The remains of famed Cylart, so faithful and good,\n    The bounds of the cantred conceal;\n  Whenever the doe or the stag he pursued\n    His master was sure of a meal.",
        "No reference was made in the first edition to the Gellert legend,\nbut in the second edition of 1794, p. 75, a note was added telling\nthe legend, “There is a general tradition in North Wales that a wolf\nhad entered the house of Prince Llewellyn. Soon after the Prince\nreturned home, and, going into the nursery, he met his dog Kill-\nhart, all bloody and wagging his tail at him; Prince Llewellyn,\non entering the room found the cradle where his child lay\noverturned, and the floor flowing with blood; imagining that the\ngreyhound had killed the child, he immediately drew his sword and\nstabbed it; then, turning up the cradle, found under it the child\nalive, and the wolf dead. This so grieved the Prince, that he\nerected a tomb over his faithful dog’s grave; where afterwards the\nparish church was built and goes by that name–Bedd Cilhart,\nor the grave of Kill-hart, in Carnarvonshire. From this\nincident is elicited a very common Welsh proverb [that given above\nwhich occurs also in ’The Fables of Cattwg;’ it will be observed\nthat it is quite indefinite.]” “Prince Llewellyn ab Jorwerth married\nJoan, [natural] daughter of King John, by Agatha, daughter\nof Robert Ferrers, Earl of Derby; and the dog was a present to\nthe prince from his father-in-law about the year 1205.” It was\nclearly from this note that the Hon. Mr. Spencer got his account;\noral tradition does not indulge in dates Anno Domini. The\napplication of the general legend of “the man who slew his\ngreyhound” to the dog Cylart, was due to the learning of E. Jones,\nauthor of the Musical Relicks. I am convinced of this, for by\na lucky chance I am enabled to give the real legend about Cylart,\nwhich is thus given in Carlisle’s Topographical Dictionary of\nWales, s.v., “Bedd Celert,” published in 1811, the date of\npublication of Mr. Spencer’s Poems. “Its name, according to\ntradition, implies The Grave of Celert, a Greyhound which\nbelonged to Llywelyn, the last Prince of Wales: and a large Rock is\nstill pointed out as the monument of this celebrated Dog, being on\nthe spot where it was found dead, together with the stag which it\nhad pursued from Carnarvon,” which is thirteen miles distant. The\ncairn was thus a monument of a “record” run of a greyhound: the\nenglyn quoted by Jones is suitable enough for this, while\nquite inadequate to record the later legendary exploits of Gêlert.\nJones found an englyn devoted to an exploit of a dog named\nCylart, and chose to interpret it in his second edition, 1794, as the\nexploit of a greyhound with which all the world (in Wales) were\nacquainted. Mr. Spencer took the legend from Jones (the reference\nto the date 1205 proves that), enshrined it in his somewhat banal\nverses, which were lucky enough to be copied into several reading-books,\nand thus became known to all English-speaking folk.",
        "It remains only to explain why Jones connected the legend with\nLlewelyn. Llewelyn had local connection with Bedd Gellert, which was\nthe seat of an Augustinian abbey, one of the oldest in Wales. An\ninspeximus of Edward I. given in Dugdale, Monast. Angl., ed.\npr. ii. 100a, quotes as the earliest charter of the abbey “Cartam\nLewelin, magni.” The name of the abbey was “Beth Kellarth\"; the\nname is thus given by Leland, l.c., and as late as 1794 an\nengraving at the British Museum is entitled “Beth Kelert,” while\nCarlisle gives it as “Beth Celert.” The place was thus named after\nthe abbey, not after the cairn or rock. This is confirmed by the\nfact of which Prof. Rhys had informed me, that the collocation of\nletters rt is un-Welsh. Under these circumstances it is not\nimpossible, I think, that the earlier legend of the marvellous run\nof “Cylart” from Carnarvon was due to the etymologising fancy of\nsome English-speaking Welshman who interpreted the name as Killhart,\nso that the simpler legend would be only a folk-etymology.",
        "But whether Kellarth, Kelert, Cylart, Gêlert or Gellert ever existed\nand ran a hart from Carnarvon to Bedd Gellert or no, there can be\nlittle doubt after the preceding that he was not the original hero\nof the fable of “the man that slew his greyhound,” which came to\nWales from Buddhistic India through channels which are perfectly\ntraceable. It was Edward Jones who first raised him to that proud\nposition, and William Spencer who securely installed him there,\nprobably for all time. The legend is now firmly established at Bedd\nGellert. There is said to be an ancient air, “Bedd Gelert,” “as sung\nby the Ancient Britons\"; it is given in a pamphlet published at\nCarnarvon in the “fifties,” entitled Gellert’s Grave; or,\nLlewellyn’s Rashness: a Ballad, by the Hon. W. R. Spencer, to which\nis added that ancient Welsh air, “Bedd Gelert,” as sung by the\nAncient Britons. The air is from R. Roberts’ “Collection of\nWelsh Airs,” but what connection it has with the legend I have been\nunable to ascertain. This is probably another case of adapting one\ntradition to another. It is almost impossible to distinguish\npalaeozoic and cainozoic strata in oral tradition. According to\nMurray’s Guide to N. Wales, p. 125, the only authority for\nthe cairn now shown is that of the landlord of the Goat Inn, “who\nfelt compelled by the cravings of tourists to invent a grave.” Some\nold men at Bedd Gellert, Prof. Rhys informs me, are ready to testify\nthat they saw the cairn laid. They might almost have been present at\nthe birth of the legend, which, if my affiliation of it is correct,\nis not yet quite 100 years old.",
        "Source.–Lluyd, Archaeologia Britannia, 1707, the\nfirst comparative Celtic grammar and the finest piece of work in\ncomparative philology hitherto done in England, contains this tale\nas a specimen of Cornish then still spoken in Cornwall. I have used\nthe English version contained in Blackwood’s Magazine as long\nago as May 1818. I have taken the third counsel from the Irish\nversion, as the original is not suited virginibus puerisque,\nthough harmless enough in itself.",
        "Parallels.–Lover has a tale, The Three Advices. It\noccurs also in modern Cornwall ap. Hunt, Drolls of West of\nEngland, 344, “The Tinner of Chyamor.” Borrow, Wild Wales, 41,\nhas a reference which seems to imply that the story had crystallised\ninto a Welsh proverb. Curiously enough, it forms the chief episode\nof the so-called “Irish Odyssey” (”Merugud Uilix maiec Leirtis“\n–\"Wandering of Ulysses M’Laertes”). It was derived, in all probability,\nfrom the Gesta Romanorum, c. 103, where two of the three pieces\nof advice are “Avoid a byeway,” “Beware of a house where the\nhousewife is younger than her husband.” It is likely enough that this\nchapter, like others of the Gesta, came from the East, for it is\nfound in some versions of “The Forty Viziers,” and in the Turkish\nTales (see Oesterley’s parallels and Gesta, ed. Swan and\nHooper, note 9).",
        "Source.–From the late D. W. Logie, written down by Mr.\nAlfred Nutt.",
        "Parallels.–Dr. Hyde’s “Teig O’Kane and the Corpse,” and\nKennedy’s “Cauth Morrisy,” Legend. Fict., 158, are practically\nthe same.",
        "Remarks.–No collection of Celtic Folk-Tales would be\nrepresentative that did not contain some specimen of the gruesome.\nThe most effective ghoul story in existence is Lover’s “Brown Man.”",
        "Source.–Campbell (Pop. Tales, W. Highlands, No. ii.),\nwith touches from the seventh variant and others, including the\ncasket and key finish, from Curtin’s “Son of the King of Erin\"\n(Myths, &c., 32 seq.). I have also added a specimen of the\nhumorous end pieces added by Gaelic story-tellers; on these tags see\nan interesting note in MacDougall’s Tales, note on p. 112. I\nhave found some difficulty in dealing with Campbell’s excessive use\nof the second person singular, “If thou thouest him some two or\nthree times, ’tis well,” but beyond that it is wearisome.\nPractically, I have reserved thou for the speech of giants,\nwho may be supposed to be somewhat old-fashioned. I fear, however, I\nhave not been quite consistent, though the you’s addressed to\nthe apple-pips are grammatically correct as applied to the pair of\nlovers.",
        "Parallels.–Besides the eight versions given or abstracted by\nCampbell and Mr. Curtin’s, there is Carleton’s “Three Tasks,” Dr.\nHyde’s “Son of Branduf” (MS.); there is the First Tale of MacInnes\n(where see Mr. Nutt’s elaborate notes, 431-43), two in the Celtic\nMagazine, vol. xii., “Grey Norris from Warland” (Folk-Lore\nJourn. i. 316), and Mr. Lang’s Morayshire Tale, “Nicht Nought\nNothing” (see Eng. Fairy Tales, No. vii.), no less than\nsixteen variants found among the Celts. It must have occurred early\namong them. Mr. Nutt found the feather-thatch incident in the\nAgallamh na Senoraib (\"Discourse of Elders”), which is at\nleast as old as the fifteenth century. Yet the story is to be found\nthroughout the Indo-European world, as is shown by Prof. Köhler’s\nelaborate list of parallels attached to Mr. Lang’s variant in\nRevue Celtique, iii. 374; and Mr. Lang, in his Custom and\nMyth (\"A far travelled Tale”), has given a number of parallels\nfrom savage sources. And strangest of all, the story is practically\nthe same as the classical myth of Jason and Medea.",
        "Remarks.–Mr. Nutt, in his discussion of the tale (MacInnes,\nTales 441), makes the interesting suggestion that the obstacles\nto pursuit, the forest, the mountain, and the river, exactly represent\nthe boundary of the old Teutonic Hades, so that the story was\noriginally one of the Descent to Hell. Altogether it seems likely that\nit is one of the oldest folk-tales in existence, and belonged to the\nstory-store of the original Aryans, whoever they were, was passed\nby them with their language on to the Hellenes and perhaps to the\nIndians, was developed in its modern form in Scandinavia (where\nits best representative “The Master Maid” of Asbjörnsen is still found),\nwas passed by them to the Celts and possibly was transmitted by\nthese latter to other parts of Europe, perhaps by early Irish monks\n(see notes on “Sea-Maiden”). The spread in the Buddhistic world,\nand thence to the South Seas and Madagascar, would be secondary\nfrom India. I hope to have another occasion for dealing with this\nmost interesting of all folk-tales in the detail it deserves.",

        "Parallels.–Another variant from Glamorganshire is given in Y\nCymmrodor, vi. 209. Croker has the story under the title I have\ngiven the Welsh one in his Fairy Legends, 41. Mr. Hartland,\nin his Science of Fairy Tales, 113-6, gives the European\nparallels.",

        "Parallels.–\"The Lad with the Skin Coverings” is a popular\nCeltic figure, cf. MacDougall’s Third Tale, MacInnes’ Second,\nand a reference in Campbell, iii. 147. According to Mr. Nutt\n(Holy Grail, 134), he is the original of Parzival. But the\nadventures in these tales are not the “cure by laughing” incident\nwhich forms the centre of our tale, and is Indo-European in extent\n(cf. references in English Fairy Tales, notes to No. xxvii.).\n\"The smith who made hell too hot for him is Sisyphus,” says Mr.\nLang (Introd. to Grimm, p. xiii.); in Ireland he is Billy Dawson\n(Carleton, Three Wishes). In the Finn-Saga, Conan harries\nhell, as readers of Waverley may remember “’Claw for claw,\nand devil take the shortest nails,’ as Conan said to the Devil\"\n(cf. Campbell, The Fians, 73, and notes, 283). Red-haired\nmen in Ireland and elsewhere are always rogues (see Mr. Nutt’s\nreferences, MacInnes’ Tales, 477; to which add the case\nin “Lough Neagh,” Yeats, Irish Folk-Tales, p. 210).",
