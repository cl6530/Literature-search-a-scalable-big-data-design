        "The evening before, I had sent my automobile to Rouen by the\nhighway. I was to travel to Rouen by rail, on my way to visit some\nfriends that live on the banks of the Seine.",
        "At Paris, a few minutes before the train started, seven gentlemen\nentered my compartment; five of them were smoking. No matter that\nthe journey was a short one, the thought of traveling with such a\ncompany was not agreeable to me, especially as the car was built\non the old model, without a corridor. I picked up my overcoat, my\nnewspapers and my time-table, and sought refuge in a neighboring\ncompartment.",
        "It was occupied by a lady, who, at sight of me, made a gesture of\nannoyance that did not escape my notice, and she leaned toward a\ngentleman who was standing on the step and was, no doubt, her\nhusband. The gentleman scrutinized me closely, and, apparently, my\nappearance did not displease him, for he smiled as he spoke to his\nwife with the air of one who reassures a frightened child. She\nsmiled also, and gave me a friendly glance as if she now\nunderstood that I was one of those gallant men with whom a woman\ncan remain shut up for two hours in a little box, six feet square,\nand have nothing to fear.",
        "Her husband said to her:",
        "“I have an important appointment, my dear, and cannot wait any\nlonger. Adieu.”",
        "He kissed her affectionately and went away. His wife threw him a\nfew kisses and waved her handkerchief. The whistle sounded, and\nthe train started.",
        "At that precise moment, and despite the protests of the guards,\nthe door was opened, and a man rushed into our compartment. My\ncompanion, who was standing and arranging her luggage, uttered a\ncry of terror and fell upon the seat. I am not a coward--far from\nit--but I confess that such intrusions at the last minute are\nalways disconcerting. They have a suspicious, unnatural aspect.",
        "However, the appearance of the new arrival greatly modified the\nunfavorable impression produced by his precipitant action. He was\ncorrectly and elegantly dressed, wore a tasteful cravat, correct\ngloves, and his face was refined and intelligent. But, where the\ndevil had I seen that face before? Because, beyond all possible\ndoubt, I had seen it. And yet the memory of it was so vague and\nindistinct that I felt it would be useless to try to recall it at\nthat time.",
        "Then, directing my attention to the lady, I was amazed at the\npallor and anxiety I saw in her face. She was looking at her\nneighbor--they occupied seats on the same side of the compartment--\nwith an expression of intense alarm, and I perceived that one of\nher trembling hands was slowly gliding toward a little traveling\nbag that was lying on the seat about twenty inches from her. She\nfinished by seizing it and nervously drawing it to her. Our eyes\nmet, and I read in hers so much anxiety and fear that I could not\nrefrain from speaking to her:",
        "“Are you ill, madame? Shall I open the window?”",
        "Her only reply was a gesture indicating that she was afraid of our\ncompanion. I smiled, as her husband had done, shrugged my\nshoulders, and explained to her, in pantomime, that she had\nnothing to fear, that I was there, and, besides, the gentleman\nappeared to be a very harmless individual. At that moment, he\nturned toward us, scrutinized both of us from head to foot, then\nsettled down in his corner and paid us no more attention.",
        "After a short silence, the lady, as if she had mustered all her\nenergy to perform a desperate act, said to me, in an almost\ninaudible voice:",
        "“Do you know who is on our train?”",
        "“Who?”",
        "“He....he....I assure you....”",
        "“Who is he?”",
        "“Arsene Lupin!”",
        "She had not taken her eyes off our companion, and it was to him\nrather than to me that she uttered the syllables of that\ndisquieting name. He drew his hat over his face. Was that to\nconceal his agitation or, simply, to arrange himself for sleep?\nThen I said to her:",
        "“Yesterday, through contumacy, Arsene Lupin was sentenced to\ntwenty years’ imprisonment at hard labor. Therefore it is\nimprobable that he would be so imprudent, to-day, as to show\nhimself in public. Moreover, the newspapers have announced his\nappearance in Turkey since his escape from the Sante.”",
        "“But he is on this train at the present moment,” the lady\nproclaimed, with the obvious intention of being heard by our\ncompanion; “my husband is one of the directors in the penitentiary\nservice, and it was the stationmaster himself who told us that a\nsearch was being made for Arsene Lupin.”",
        "“They may have been mistaken---”",
        "“No; he was seen in the waiting-room. He bought a first-class\nticket for Rouen.”",
        "“He has disappeared. The guard at the waiting-room door did not\nsee him pass, and it is supposed that he had got into the express\nthat leaves ten minutes after us.”",
        "“In that case, they will be sure to catch him.”",
        "“Unless, at the last moment, he leaped from that train to come\nhere, into our train....which is quite probable....which is\nalmost certain.”",
        "“If so, he will be arrested just the same; for the employees and\nguards would no doubt observe his passage from one train to the\nother, and, when we arrive at Rouen, they will arrest him there.”",
        "“Him--never! He will find some means of escape.”",
        "“In that case, I wish him ’bon voyage.’”",
        "“But, in the meantime, think what he may do!”",
        "“What?”",
        "“I don’t know. He may do anything.”",
        "She was greatly agitated, and, truly, the situation justified, to\nsome extent, her nervous excitement. I was impelled to say to her:",
        "“Of course, there are many strange coincidences, but you need have\nno fear. Admitting that Arsene Lupin is on this train, he will not\ncommit any indiscretion; he will be only too happy to escape the\nperil that already threatens him.”",
        "My words did not reassure her, but she remained silent for a time.\nI unfolded my newspapers and read reports of Arsene Lupin’s trial,\nbut, as they contained nothing that was new to me, I was not\ngreatly interested. Moreover, I was tired and sleepy. I felt my\neyelids close and my head drop.",
        "“But, monsieur, you are not going to sleep!”",
        "She seized my newspaper, and looked at me with indignation.",
        "“Certainly not,” I said.",
        "“That would be very imprudent.”",
        "“Of course,” I assented.",
        "I struggled to keep awake. I looked through the window at the\nlandscape and the fleeting clouds, but in a short time all that\nbecame confused and indistinct; the image of the nervous lady and\nthe drowsy gentleman were effaced from my memory, and I was buried\nin the soothing depths of a profound sleep. The tranquility of my\nresponse was soon disturbed by disquieting dreams, wherein a\ncreature that had played the part and bore the name of Arsene\nLupin held an important place. He appeared to me with his black\nladen with articles of value; he leaped over walls, and plundered\ncastles. But the outlines of that creature, who was no longer\nArsene Lupin, assumed a more definite form. He came toward me,\ngrowing larger and larger, leaped into the compartment with\nincredible agility, and landed squarely on my chest. With a cry of\nfright and pain, I awoke. The man, the traveller, our companion,\nwith his knee on my breast, held me by the throat.",
        "My sight was very indistinct, for my eyes were suffused with\nblood. I could see the lady, in a corner of the compartment,\nconvulsed with fright. I tried even not to resist. Besides, I did\nnot have the strength. My temples throbbed; I was almost\nstrangled. One minute more, and I would have breathed my last. The\nman must have realized it, for he relaxed his grip, but did not\nremove his had. Then he took a cord, in which he had prepared a\nslip-knot, and tied my wrists together. In an instant, I was\nbound, gagged, and helpless.",
        "Certainly, he accomplished the trick with an ease and skill that\nrevealed the hand of a master; he was, no doubt, a professional\nthief. Not a word, not a nervous movement; only coolness and\naudacity. And I was there, lying on the bench, bound like a mummy,\nI--Arsene Lupin!",
        "It was anything but a laughing matter, and yet, despite the\ngravity of the situation, I keenly appreciated the humor and irony\nthat it involved. Arsene Lupin seized and bound like a novice!\nrobbed as if I were an unsophisticated rustic--for, you must\nunderstand, the scoundrel had deprived me of my purse and wallet!\nArsene Lupin, a victim, duped, vanquished....What an adventure!",
        "The lady did not move. He did not even notice her. He contented\nhimself with picking up her traveling-bag that had fallen to the\nfloor and taking from it the jewels, purse, and gold and silver\ntrinkets that it contained. The lady opened her eyes, trembled\nwith fear, drew the rings from her fingers and handed them to the\nman as if she wished to spare him unnecessary trouble. He took the\nrings and looked at her. She swooned.",
        "Then, quite unruffled, he resumed his seat, lighted a cigarette,\nand proceeded to examine the treasure that he had acquired. The\nexamination appeared to give him perfect satisfaction.",
        "But I was not so well satisfied. I do not speak of the twelve\nthousand francs of which I had been unduly deprived: that was only\na temporary loss, because I was certain that I would recover\npossession of that money after a very brief delay, together with\nthe important papers contained in my wallet: plans, specifications,\naddresses, lists of correspondents, and compromising letters.\nBut, for the moment, a more immediate and more serious question\ntroubled me: How would this affair end? What would be the outcome\nof this adventure?",
        "As you can imagine, the disturbance created by my passage through\nthe Saint-Lazare station has not escaped my notice. Going to visit\nfriends who knew me under the name of Guillaume Berlat, and\namongst whom my resemblance to Arsene Lupin was a subject of many\ninnocent jests, I could not assume a disguise, and my presence had\nbeen remarked. So, beyond question, the commissary of police at\nRouen, notified by telegraph, and assisted by numerous agents,\nwould be awaiting the train, would question all suspicious\npassengers, and proceed to search the cars.",
        "Of course, I had foreseen all that, but it had not disturbed me,\nas I was certain that the police of Rouen would not be any\nshrewder than the police of Paris and that I could escape\nrecognition; would it not be sufficient for me to carelessly\ndisplay my card as “depute,” thanks to which I had inspired\ncomplete confidence in the gate-keeper at Saint-Lazare?--But the\nsituation was greatly changed. I was no longer free. It was\nimpossible to attempt one of my usual tricks. In one of the\ncompartments, the commissary of police would find Mon. Arsene\nLupin, bound hand and foot, as docile as a lamb, packed up, all\nready to be dumped into a prison-van. He would have simply to\naccept delivery of the parcel, the same as if it were so much\nmerchandise or a basket of fruit and vegetables. Yet, to avoid\nthat shameful denouement, what could I do?--bound and gagged, as I\nwas? And the train was rushing on toward Rouen, the next and only\nstation.",
        "Another problem was presented, in which I was less interested, but\nthe solution of which aroused my professional curiosity. What were\nthe intentions of my rascally companion? Of course, if I had been\nalone, he could, on our arrival at Rouen, leave the car slowly and\nfearlessly. But the lady? As soon as the door of the compartment\nshould be opened, the lady, now so quiet and humble, would scream\nand call for help. That was the dilemma that perplexed me! Why had\nhe not reduced her to a helpless condition similar to mine? That\nwould have given him ample time to disappear before his double\ncrime was discovered.",
        "He was still smoking, with his eyes fixed upon the window that was\nnow being streaked with drops of rain. Once he turned, picked up\nmy time-table, and consulted it.",
        "The lady had to feign a continued lack of consciousness in order\nto deceive the enemy. But fits of coughing, provoked by the smoke,\nexposed her true condition. As to me, I was very uncomfortable,\nand very tired. And I meditated; I plotted.",
        "The train was rushing on, joyously, intoxicated with its own\nspeed.",
        "Saint Etienne!....At that moment, the man arose and took two steps\ntoward us, which caused the lady to utter a cry of alarm and fall\ninto a genuine swoon. What was the man about to do? He lowered the\nwindow on our side. A heavy rain was now falling, and, by a\ngesture, the man expressed his annoyance at his not having an\numbrella or an overcoat. He glanced at the rack. The lady’s\numbrella was there. He took it. He also took my overcoat and put\nit on.",
        "We were now crossing the Seine. He turned up the bottoms of his\ntrousers, then leaned over and raised the exterior latch of the\ndoor. Was he going to throw himself upon the track? At that speed,\nit would have been instant death. We now entered a tunnel. The man\nopened the door half-way and stood on the upper step. What folly!\nThe darkness, the smoke, the noise, all gave a fantastic\nappearance to his actions. But suddenly, the train diminished its\nspeed. A moment later it increased its speed, then slowed up\nagain. Probably, some repairs were being made in that part of the\ntunnel which obliged the trains to diminish their speed, and the\nman was aware of the fact. He immediately stepped down to the\nlower step, closed the door behind him, and leaped to the ground.\nHe was gone.",
        "The lady immediately recovered her wits, and her first act was to\nlament the loss of her jewels. I gave her an imploring look. She\nunderstood, and quickly removed the gag that stifled me. She\nwished to untie the cords that bound me, but I prevented her.",
        "“No, no, the police must see everything exactly as it stands. I\nwant them to see what the rascal did to us.”",
        "“Suppose I pull the alarm-bell?”",
        "“Too late. You should have done that when he made the attack on\nme.”",
        "“But he would have killed me. Ah! monsieur, didn’t I tell you that\nhe was on this train. I recognized him from his portrait. And now\nhe has gone off with my jewels.”",
        "“Don’t worry. The police will catch him.”",
        "“Catch Arsene Lupin! Never.”",
        "“That depends on you, madame. Listen. When we arrive at Rouen, be\nat the door and call. Make a noise. The police and the railway\nemployees will come. Tell what you have seen: the assault made on\nme and the flight of Arsene Lupin. Give a description of him--soft\nhat, umbrella--yours--gray overcoat....”",
        "“Yours,” said she.",
        "“What! mine? Not at all. It was his. I didn’t have any.”",
        "“It seems to me he didn’t have one when he came in.”",
        "“Yes, yes....unless the coat was one that some one had forgotten\nand left in the rack. At all events, he had it when he went away,\nand that is the essential point. A gray overcoat--remember!....Ah!\nI forgot. You must tell your name, first thing you do. Your\nhusband’s official position will stimulate the zeal of the\npolice.”",
        "We arrived at the station. I gave her some further instructions in\na rather imperious tone:",
        "“Tell them my name--Guillaume Berlat. If necessary, say that you\nknow me. That will save time. We must expedite the preliminary\ninvestigation. The important thing is the pursuit of Arsene Lupin.\nYour jewels, remember! Let there be no mistake. Guillaume Berlat,\na friend of your husband.”",
        "“I understand....Guillaume Berlat.”",
        "She was already calling and gesticulating. As soon as the train\nstopped, several men entered the compartment. The critical moment\nhad come.",
        "Panting for breath, the lady exclaimed:",
        "“Arsene Lupin....he attacked us....he stole my jewels....I am\nMadame Renaud....my husband is a director of the penitentiary\nservice....Ah! here is my brother, Georges Ardelle, director of\nthe Credit Rouennais....you must know....”",
        "She embraced a young man who had just joined us, and whom the\ncommissary saluted. Then she continued, weeping:",
        "“Yes, Arsene Lupin....while monsieur was sleeping, he seized him\nby the throat....Mon. Berlat, a friend of my husband.”",
        "The commissary asked:",
        "“But where is Arsene Lupin?”",
        "“He leaped from the train, when passing through the tunnel.”",
        "“Are you sure that it was he?”",
        "“Am I sure! I recognized him perfectly. Besides, he was seen at\nthe Saint-Lazare station. He wore a soft hat---”",
        "“No, a hard felt, like that,” said the commissary, pointing to my\nhat.",
        "“He had a soft hat, I am sure,” repeated Madame Renaud, “and a\ngray overcoat.”",
        "“Yes, that is right,” replied the commissary, “the telegram says\nhe wore a gray overcoat with a black velvet collar.”",
        "“Exactly, a black velvet collar,” exclaimed Madame Renaud,\ntriumphantly.",
        "I breathed freely. Ah! the excellent friend I had in that little\nwoman.",
        "The police agents had now released me. I bit my lips until they\nran blood. Stooping over, with my handkerchief over my mouth, an\nattitude quite natural in a person who has remained for a long\ntime in an uncomfortable position, and whose mouth shows the\nbloody marks of the gag, I addressed the commissary, in a weak\nvoice:",
        "“Monsieur, it was Arsene Lupin. There is no doubt about that. If\nwe make haste, he can be caught yet. I think I may be of some\nservice to you.”",
        "The railway car, in which the crime occurred, was detached from\nthe train to serve as a mute witness at the official investigation.\nThe train continued on its way to Havre. We were then conducted to\nthe station-master’s office through a crowd of curious spectators.",
        "Then, I had a sudden access of doubt and discretion. Under some\npretext or other, I must gain my automobile, and escape. To remain\nthere was dangerous. Something might happen; for instance, a\ntelegram from Paris, and I would be lost.",
        "Yes, but what about my thief? Abandoned to my own resources, in an\nunfamiliar country, I could not hope to catch him.",
        "“Bah! I must make the attempt,” I said to myself. “It may be a\ndifficult game, but an amusing one, and the stake is well worth\nthe trouble.”",
        "And when the commissary asked us to repeat the story of the\nrobbery, I exclaimed:",
        "“Monsieur, really, Arsene Lupin is getting the start of us. My\nautomobile is waiting in the courtyard. If you will be so kind as\nto use it, we can try....”",
        "The commissary smiled, and replied:",
        "“The idea is a good one; so good, indeed, that it is already being\ncarried out. Two of my men have set out on bicycles. They have\nbeen gone for some time.”",
        "“Where did they go?”",
        "“To the entrance of the tunnel. There, they will gather evidence,\nsecure witnesses, and follow on the track of Arsene Lupin.”",
        "I could not refrain from shrugging my shoulders, as I replied:",
        "“Your men will not secure any evidence or any witnesses.”",
        "“Really!”",
        "“Arsene Lupin will not allow anyone to see him emerge from the\ntunnel. He will take the first road---”",
        "“To Rouen, where we will arrest him.”",
        "“He will not go to Rouen.”",
        "“Then he will remain in the vicinity, where his capture will be\neven more certain.”",
        "“He will not remain in the vicinity.”",
        "“Oh! oh! And where will he hide?”",
        "I looked at my watch, and said:",
        "“At the present moment, Arsene Lupin is prowling around the\nstation at Darnetal. At ten fifty, that is, in twenty-two minutes\nfrom now, he will take the train that goes from Rouen to Amiens.”",
        "“Do you think so? How do you know it?”",
        "“Oh! it is quite simple. While we were in the car, Arsene Lupin\nconsulted my railway guide. Why did he do it? Was there, not far\nfrom the spot where he disappeared, another line of railway, a\nstation upon that line, and a train stopping at that station? On\nconsulting my railway guide, I found such to be the case.”",
        "“Really, monsieur,” said the commissary, “that is a marvelous\ndeduction. I congratulate you on your skill.”",
        "I was now convinced that I had made a mistake in displaying so\nmuch cleverness. The commissary regarded me with astonishment, and\nI though a slight suspicion entered his official mind....Oh!\nscarcely that, for the photographs distributed broadcast by the\npolice department were too imperfect; they presented an Arsene\nLupin so different from the one he had before him, that he could\nnot possibly recognize me by it. But, all the same, he was\ntroubled, confused and ill-at-ease.",
        "“Mon Dieu! nothing stimulates the comprehension so much as the\nloss of a pocketbook and the desire to recover it. And it seems to\nme that if you will give me two of your men, we may be able....”",
        "“Oh! I beg of you, monsieur le commissaire,” cried Madame Renaud,\n“listen to Mon. Berlat.”",
        "The intervention of my excellent friend was decisive. Pronounced\nby her, the wife of an influential official, the name of Berlat\nbecame really my own, and gave me an identity that no mere\nsuspicion could affect. The commissary arose, and said:",
        "“Believe me, Monsieur Berlat, I shall be delighted to see you\nsucceed. I am as much interested as you are in the arrest of\nArsene Lupin.”",
        "He accompanied me to the automobile, and introduced two of his men,\nHonore Massol and Gaston Delivet, who were assigned to assist me.\nMy chauffer cranked up the car and I took my place at the wheel. A\nfew seconds later, we left the station. I was saved.",
        "Ah! I must confess that in rolling over the boulevards that\nsurrounded the old Norman city, in my swift thirty-five horse-power\nMoreau-Lepton, I experienced a deep feeling of pride, and the motor\nresponded, sympathetically to my desires. At right and left, the\ntrees flew past us with startling rapidity, and I, free, out of\ndanger, had simply to arrange my little personal affairs with the\ntwo honest representatives of the Rouen police who were sitting\nbehind me. Arsene Lupin was going in search of Arsene Lupin!",
        "Modest guardians of social order--Gaston Delivet and Honore Massol--\nhow valuable was your assistance! What would I have done without\nyou? Without you, many times, at the cross-roads, I might have\ntaken the wrong route! Without you, Arsene Lupin would have made a\nmistake, and the other would have escaped!",
        "But the end was not yet. Far from it. I had yet to capture the\nthief and recover the stolen papers. Under no circumstances must\nmy two acolytes be permitted to see those papers, much less to\nseize them. That was a point that might give me some difficulty.",
        "We arrived at Darnetal three minutes after the departure of the\ntrain. True, I had the consolation of learning that a man wearing\na gray overcoat with a black velvet collar had taken the train at\nthe station. He had bought a second-class ticket for Amiens.\nCertainly, my debut as detective was a promising one.",
        "Delivet said to me:",
        "“The train is express, and the next stop is Monterolier-Buchy in\nnineteen minutes. If we do not reach there before Arsene Lupin, he\ncan proceed to Amiens, or change for the train going to Cleres,\nand, from that point, reach Dieppe or Paris.”",
        "“How far to Monterolier?”",
        "“Twenty-three kilometres.”",
        "“Twenty-three kilometres in nineteen minutes....We will be there\nahead of him.”",
        "We were off again! Never had my faithful Moreau-Repton responded\nto my impatience with such ardor and regularity. It participated\nin my anxiety. It indorsed my determination. It comprehended my\nanimosity against that rascally Arsene Lupin. The knave! The\ntraitor!",
        "“Turn to the right,” cried Delivet, “then to the left.”",
        "We fairly flew, scarcely touching the ground. The mile-stones\nlooked like little timid beasts that vanished at our approach.\nSuddenly, at a turn of the road, we saw a vortex of smoke. It was\nthe Northern Express. For a kilometre, it was a struggle, side by\nside, but an unequal struggle in which the issue was certain. We\nwon the race by twenty lengths.",
        "In three seconds we were on the platform standing before the\nsecond-class carriages. The doors were opened, and some passengers\nalighted, but not my thief. We made a search through the\ncompartments. No sign of Arsene Lupin.",
        "“Sapristi!” I cried, “he must have recognized me in the automobile\nas we were racing, side by side, and he leaped from the train.”",
        "“Ah! there he is now! crossing the track.”",
        "I started in pursuit of the man, followed by my two acolytes, or\nrather followed by one of them, for the other, Massol, proved\nhimself to be a runner of exceptional speed and endurance. In a\nfew moments, he had made an appreciable gain upon the fugitive.\nThe man noticed it, leaped over a hedge, scampered across a meadow,\nand entered a thick grove. When we reached this grove, Massol was\nwaiting for us. He went no farther, for fear of losing us.",
        "“Quite right, my dear friend,” I said. “After such a run, our\nvictim must be out of wind. We will catch him now.”",
        "I examined the surroundings with the idea of proceeding alone in\nthe arrest of the fugitive, in order to recover my papers,\nconcerning which the authorities would doubtless ask many\ndisagreeable questions. Then I returned to my companions, and\nsaid:",
        "“It is all quite easy. You, Massol, take your place at the left;\nyou, Delivet, at the right. From there, you can observe the entire\nposterior line of the bush, and he cannot escape without you seeing\nhim, except by that ravine, and I shall watch it. If he does not\ncome out voluntarily, I will enter and drive him out toward one or\nthe other of you. You have simply to wait. Ah! I forgot: in case\nI need you, a pistol shot.”",
        "Massol and Delivet walked away to their respective posts. As soon\nas they had disappeared, I entered the grove with the greatest\nprecaution so as to be neither seen nor heard. I encountered dense\nthickets, trough which narrow paths had been cut, but the\noverhanging boughs compelled me to adopt a stooping posture. One\nof these paths led to a clearing in which I found footsteps upon\nthe wet grass. I followed them; they led me to the foot of a mound\nwhich was surmounted by a deserted, dilapidated hovel.",
        "“He must be there,” I said to myself. “It is a well-chosen\nretreat.”",
        "I crept cautiously to the side of the building. A slight noise\ninformed me that he was there; and, then, through an opening, I saw\nhim. His back was turned toward me. In two bounds, I was upon\nhim. He tried to fire a revolver that he held in his hand. But he\nhad no time. I threw him to the ground, in such a manner that his\narms were beneath him, twisted and helpless, whilst I held him down\nwith my knee on his breast.",
        "“Listen, my boy,” I whispered in his ear. “I am Arsene Lupin. You\nare to deliver over to me, immediately and gracefully, my\npocketbook and the lady’s jewels, and, in return therefore, I will\nsave you from the police and enroll you amongst my friends. One\nword: yes or no?”",
        "“Yes,” he murmured.",
        "“Very good. Your escape, this morning, was well planned. I\ncongratulate you.”",
        "I arose. He fumbled in his pocket, drew out a large knife and\ntried to strike me with it.",
        "“Imbecile!” I exclaimed.",
        "With one hand, I parried the attack; with the other, I gave him a\nsharp blow on the carotid artery. He fell--stunned!",
        "In my pocketbook, I recovered my papers and bank-notes. Out of\ncuriosity, I took his. Upon an envelope, addressed to him, I read\nhis name: Pierre Onfrey. It startled me. Pierre Onfrey, the\nassassin of the rue Lafontaine at Auteuil! Pierre Onfrey, he who\nhad cut the throats of Madame Delbois and her two daughters. I\nleaned over him. Yes, those were the features which, in the\ncompartment, had evoked in me the memory of a face I could not then\nrecall.",
        "But time was passing. I placed in an envelope two bank-notes of\none hundred francs each, with a card bearing these words: “Arsene\nLupin to his worthy colleagues Honore Massol and Gaston Delivet, as\na slight token of his gratitude.” I placed it in a prominent spot\nin the room, where they would be sure to find it. Beside it, I\nplaced Madame Renaud’s handbag. Why could I not return it to the\nlady who had befriended me? I must confess that I had taken from\nit everything that possessed any interest or value, leaving there\nonly a shell comb, a stick of rouge Dorin for the lips, and an\nempty purse. But, you know, business is business. And then,\nreally, her husband is engaged in such a dishonorable vocation!",
        "The man was becoming conscious. What was I to do? I was unable to\nsave him or condemn him. So I took his revolver and fired a shot\nin the air.",
        "“My two acolytes will come and attend to his case,” I said to\nmyself, as I hastened away by the road through the ravine. Twenty\nminutes later, I was seated in my automobile.",
        "At four o’clock, I telegraphed to my friends at Rouen that an\nunexpected event would prevent me from making my promised visit.\nBetween ourselves, considering what my friends must now know, my\nvisit is postponed indefinitely. A cruel disillusion for them!",
        "At six o’clock I was in Paris. The evening newspapers informed me\nthat Pierre Onfrey had been captured at last.",
        "Next day,--let us not despise the advantages of judicious\nadvertising,--the `Echo de France’ published this sensational item:",
        "“Yesterday, near Buchy, after numerous exciting incidents, Arsene\nLupin effected the arrest of Pierre Onfrey. The assassin of the\nrue Lafontaine had robbed Madame Renaud, wife of the director in\nthe penitentiary service, in a railway carriage on the Paris-Havre\nline. Arsene Lupin restored to Madame Renaud the hand-bag that\ncontained her jewels, and gave a generous recompense to the two\ndetectives who had assisted him in making that dramatic arrest.”",
