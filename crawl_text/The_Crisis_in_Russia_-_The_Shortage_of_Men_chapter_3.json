        "In the preceding chapter I wrote of Russia’s many wants, and\nof the processes visibly at work, tending to make her\ncondition worse and not better.   But I wrote of things, not\nof people.  I wrote of the shortage of this and of that, but\nnot of the most serious of all shortages, which, while itself\nlargely due to those already discussed, daily intensifies them,\nand points the way to that further stage of decay which is\nthreatened in the near future in Russia, and, in the more\ndistant future in Europe.  I did not write of the shortage\ndeterioration of labor.",
        "Shortage of labor is not peculiar to Russia.  It is among the\npostwar phenomena common to all countries.  The war and\nits accompanying eases have cost Europe, including Russia,\nan enormous number of able-bodied men.  Many millions of\nothers have lost the habit of regular work.German\nindustrialists complain that they cannot get labor, and that\nwhen they get it, it is not productive.  I heard complaints on\nthe same subject in England.  But just as the economic crisis,\ndue in the first instance to the war and the isolation it\nimposed, has gone further in Russia than elsewhere, so the\nshortage of labor, at present a handicap, an annoyance in\nmore fortunate countries, is in Russia perhaps the greatest of\nthe national dangers.  Shortage of labor cannot be measured\nsimply by the decreasing numbers of the workmen.  If it\ntakes two workmen as long to do a particular job in 1920 as\nit took one man to do it in 1914, then, even if the  number\nof workman has remained the same, the actual supply of\nlabor has been halved.  And in Russia the situation is worse\nthan that.  For example, in the group of State metal-working\nfactories, those, in fact which may be considered as the\nweapon with which Russia is trying to cut her way out of her\ntransport difficulties, apart from the fact that there were in\n19l6 81,600 workmen, whereas in 1920 there are only\n42,500, labor has deteriorated in the most appalling manner.\nIn 1916 in these factories 92 per cent. of the nominal\nworking  hours were actually kept; in 1920 work goes on\nduring only 60 per cent. of the nominal hours.  It is\nestimated that the labor of a single workman produces now\nonly one quarter of what it produced in 1916.  To take\nanother example, also from workmen engaged in transport,\nthat is to say, in the most important of all work at the present\ntime: in the Moscow junction of the Moscow Kazan\nRailway, between November 1st and February 29th (1920),\n292 workmen and clerks missed 12,048 working days, being\nabsent, on in average, forty days per man in the four\nmonths.  In Moscow passenger-station on this line, 22\nworkmen missed in November 106 days, in December 273,\nin January 338, and in February 380; in an appalling",
        "crescendo further illustrated by the wagon department,\nwhere 28 workmen missed in November 104 days and in\nFebruary 500.  In November workmen absented themselves\nfor single days.  In February the same workmen were absent\nfor the greater part of the month.  The invariable excuse was\nillness.  Many cases of illness there undoubtedly were, since\nthis period was the worst of the typhus epidemic, but besides\nillness, and besides mere obvious idleness which no\ndoubt accounts for a certain proportion of illegitimate\nholidays, there is another explanation which goes nearer the\nroot of the matter.  Much of the time filched from the State\nwas in all probability spent in expeditions in search of food.\nIn Petrograd, the Council of Public Economy complain that\nthere is a tendency to turn the eight-hour day into a four-hour\nday.  Attempts are being made to arrest this tendency\nby making an additional food allowance conditional on the\nactual fulfilment of working days.  In the Donetz coal basin,\nthe monthly output per man was in 1914 750 poods, in 1916\n615 poods, in 1919 240 poods (figures taken from\nEkaterinoslav Government), and in 1920 theoutput per man\nis estimated at being something near 220 poods.\nIn the shale mines on the Volga, where food conditions are\ncomparatively good, productivity is comparatively high.\nThus in a small mine near Simbirsk there are 230 workmen,\nof’ whom 50 to 60 are skilled.  The output for the unskilled\nis 28.9 poods in a shift, for the skilled 68.3.  But even there\n25 per cent. of the workmen are regular absentees, and\nactually the mine works only 17 or 18 days in a month, that\nis, 70 per cent. of the normal number of working\ndays.  The remaining 30 per cent. of normal working time is\nspent by the workmen in getting food.  Another small mine\nin the same district is worked entirely by unskilled labor,\nthe wokers being peasants from the neighboring villages.  In this\nmine the productivity per man is less, but all the men work\nfull time.  They do not have to waste time in securing food,\nbecause, being local peasants, they are supplied by their own\nvillages and families.  In Moscow and Petrograd food is far\nmore difficult to secure, more time is wasted on that\nhopeless task; even with that waste of time, the workman is\nnot properly fed, and it cannot be wondered at that his\nproductivity is low.",
        "Something, no doubt, is due to the natural character of the\nRussians, which led Trotsky to define man as an animal",
        "distinguished by laziness.  Russians are certainly lazy, and\nprobably owe to their climate their remarkable incapacity for\nprolonged effort.  The Russian climate is such that over\nlarge areas of Russia the Russian peasant is accustomed, and\nhas been accustomed for hundreds of years, to perform\nprodigies of labor during two short periods of sowing\nand harvest, and to spend the immensely long and\nmonotonous winter in a hibernation like that of the snake or\nthe dormouse.  There is a much greater difference between a\nRussian workman’s normal output and that of which he is\ncapable for a short time if he sets himself to it, than there is\nbetween the normal and exceptional output of an\nEnglishman, whose temperate climate has not taught him to\nregard a great part of the year as a period of mere waiting\nfor and resting from the extraordinary effort of a few\nweeks.(*) [(*)Given any particular motive, any particula\nenthusiasm, or visible, desirable object, even the hungry\nRussian workmen of to-day are capable of sudden and\ntemporary increase of output. The “Saturdayings” (see p. 119)\nprovide endless illustrations of this.  They had something in\nthe character of a picnic, they were novel, they were out of\nthe routine, and the productivity of labor during a “Saturdaying\"\nwas invariably higher than on a weekday.  For example,\nthere is a shortage of paper for cigarettes.  People roll\ncigarettes in old newspapers.  It occurred to the Central Committee\nof the Papermakers’ Union to organize a “Sundaying\"\nwith the object of sending cigarette paper to the soldiers in\nthe Red Army. Six factories took part.  Here is a table showing the\noutput of these factories during the “Sundaying” and the average\nweekday output.  The figures are in poods.",
        "                           Made on      Average week\nFactory               the Sunday     Day Output",
        "Krasnogorodskaya.........615...............450\nGriaznovskaya.............65................45\nMedianskaya..............105................90\nDobruzhskaya.............186...............250\nBelgiiskaya..............127................85\nRopshinskaya..............85................55]",
        "But this uneven working temperament was characteristic of\nthe Russian before the war as well as now.  It has been said\nthat the revolution removed the stimulus to labor, and left the\nRussian laziness to have its way.  In the first period\nof the revolution that may have been true.  It is becoming\nday by day less true.  The fundamental reasons of low\nproductivity will not be found in any sudden or unusual\nefflorescence of idleness, but in economic conditions which\ncannot but reduce the productivity of idle and industrious\nalike.  Insufficient feeding is one such reason.  The\nproportion of working time consumed in foraging is another.\nBut the whole of my first chapter may be taken as a compact\nmass of reasons why the Russians at the present time should\nnot work with anything like a normal productivity.  It is said\nthat bad workmen complain of their tools, but even good\nones become disheartened if compelled to work with\nmakeshifts, mended tools, on a stock of materials that runs\nout from one day to the next, in factories where the\nmachinery may come at any moment to a standstill from lack\nof fuel. There would thus be a shortage of labor in Russia,\neven if the numbers of workmen were the same today as\nthey were before the war.  Unfortunately that is not so.\nTurning from the question of low productivity per man to\nthat of absolute shortage of men: the example given at the\nbeginning of this chapter, showing that in the most important\ngroup of factories the number of workmen has fallen 50 per\ncent. is by no means exceptional.  Walking through the\npassages of what used to be the Club of the Nobles, and is\nnow the house of the Trades Unions during the recent\nTrades Union Congress in Moscow,  I observed among a\nnumber of pictorial diagrams on the walls, one in particular\nillustrating the rise and fall of the working population of\nMoscow during a number of years. Each year was\nrepresented by the picture of a factory with a chimney which\nrose and fell with the population.  From that diagram I took\nthe figures for 1913, 1918 and 1919.  These figures should\nbe constantly borne in mind by any one who wishes to realize\n how catastrophic the shortage oflabor in Russia\nactually is, and to judge how sweeping may be the\nchanges in  the social configuration of the country if that shortage\ncontinues to increase.  Here are the figures:",
        "Workmen in Moscow in 1913............159,344\nWorkmen in Moscow in 1918 ...........157,282\nWorkmen in Moscow in 1919............105,210",
        "That is to say, that one-third of the workmen of Moscow",
        "ceased to live there, or ceased to be workmen, in the course\nof a single year.  A similar phenomenon is observable in\neach one of the big industrial districts.",
        "What has become of those workmen?",
        "A partial explanation is obvious.  The main impulse of the\nrevolution came from the town workers.  Of these, the metal\nworkers were the most decided, and those who most freely\njoined the Red Guard in the early and the Red Army in the\nlater days of the revolution.  Many, in those early days, when\nthere was more enthusiasm than discipline, when there were\nhardly any experienced officers, and those without much\nauthority, were slaughtered during the German advance of\n1918.  The first mobilizations, when conscription was\nintroduced, were among the workers in the great industrial\ndistricts.  The troops from Petrograd and Moscow,\nexclusively workmen’s regiments, have suffered more than\nany other during the civil war, being the most dependable\nand being thrown, like the guards of old time, into the worst\nplace at any serious crisis.  Many thousands of them have\ndied for the sake of the revolution which, were they living,\nthey would be hard put to it to save. (The special shortage of\nskilled workers is also partially to be explained by the\nindiscriminate mobilizations of 1914-15, when great\nnumbers of the most valuable engineers and other skilled\nworkers were thrown into the front line, and it was not\nuntil their loss was already felt that the Tsar’s Government in this\nmatter came belatedly to its senses.)",
        "But these explanations are only partial.  The more general\nanswer to the question, What has become of the workmen?\nlies in the very economic crisis which their absence\naccentuates.  Russia is unlike England, where starvation of\nthe towns would be practically starvation of the whole\nisland.  In Russia, if a man is hungry, he has only to\nwalk far enough and he will come to a place where there is\nplenty to eat.  Almost every Russian worker retains in some\nform or other connection with a village, where, if he returns,\nhe will not be an entire stranger, but at worst a poor relation,\nand quite possibly an honored guest.  It is not surprising that\nmany thousands have “returned to the land” in this way.",
        "Further, if a workman retains his connection, both with a\ndistant village and with a town, he can keep himself and his\nfamily fat and prosperous by ceasing to be a workman, and,\ninstead, traveling on the buffers or the roof of a railway\nwagon, and bringing back with him sacks of flour and\npotatoes for sale in the town at fantastic prices. Thereby he\nis lost to productive labor, and his uncomfortable but\nadventurous life becomes directly harmful, tending to\nincrease the strain on transport, since it is obviously\nmore economical to transport a thousand sacks than to transport a\nthousand sacks with an idle workman attached to each sack.\nFurther, his activities actually make it more difficult for the\ntown population to get food.  By keeping open for the\nvillage the possibility of selling at fantastic prices, he lessens\nthe readiness of the peasants to part with their\nflour at the lower prices of the Government.  Nor  is it as if\nhis activities benefited the working population.  The food he\nbrings in goes for the most part to those who have plenty of\nmoney or have things to exchange for it.  And honest men in\nRussia to-day have not much money, and those who have\nthings to exchange are not as a rule workmen.  The theory\nof this man’s harmfulness is, I know, open to argument, but\nthe practice at least is exactly as I have stated it, and is\nobviously attractive to the individual who prefers adventure\non a full stomach to useful work on an empty.  Setting aside\nthe theory with its latent quarrel between Free Trade and\nState control, we can still recognize that each workman\nengaged in these pursuits has become an unproductive\nmiddleman, one of that very parasitic species which the\nrevolutionaries had hoped to make unnecessary.  It is bad\nfrom the revolutionary point of view if a workman is so\nemployed, but it is no less bad from the point of view of\npeople who do not care twopence about the revolution one\nway or the other, but do care about getting Russia on her\nfeet again and out of her economic crisis.  It is bad\nenough if an unskilled workman is so employed.  It is far\nworse if a skilled workman finds he can do better for himself\nas a “food speculator” than by the exercise of his legitimate\ncraft.  From mines, from every kind of factory come\ncomplaints of the decreasing proportion of skilled to\nunskilled workmen.  The superior intelligence of the skilled\nworker offers him definite advantages should he engage in\nthese pursuits, and his actual skill gives him other advantages\nin the villages.  He can leave his factory and go to the\nvillage, there on the spot to ply his trade or variations of it,",
        "when as a handy man, repairing tools, etc., he will make an\neasy living and by lessening the dependence of the village on\nthe town do as much as the “food speculator” in worsening\nthe conditions of the workman he has left behind.",
        "And with that we come to the general changes in the social\ngeography of Russia which are threatened if the processes\nnow at work continue unchecked.  The relations between\ntown and village are the fundamental problem of the\nrevolution.  Town and countryside are in sharp contradiction\ndaily intensified by the inability of the towns to supply\nthe country’s needs.  The town may be considered as a single\nproductive organism, with feelers stretching into the country,\nand actual outposts there in the form of agricultural\nenterprises taking their directives from the centre and\nworking as definite parts of the State organism.  All round\nthis town organism, in all its interstices, it too, with its feelers\nin the form of “food speculators,” is the anarchic chaos of\nthe country, consisting of a myriad independent units,\nregulated by no plan, without a brain centre of any kind.\nEither the organized town will hold its own against and\ngradually dominate and systematize the country chaos, or\nthat chaos little by little will engulf the town organism.\nEvery workman who leaves the town automatically places\nhimself on the side of the country in that struggle.  And\nwhen a town like Moscow loses a third of its working\npopulation in a year, it is impossible not to see that, so far,\nthe struggle is going in favor of that huge chaotic,\nunconscious but immensely powerful countryside.  There is\neven a danger that the town may become divided against\nitself.  Just as scarcity of food leads to food speculation, so\nthe shortage of labor is making possible a sort of\nspeculation in labor.  The urgent need of labor has led to a\nresurrection of the methods of the direct recruiting of\nworkmen in the villages by the agents of particular factories,\nwho by exceptional terms succeed in getting workmen where\nthe Government organs fail.  And, of course, this recruiting\nis not confined to the villages.  Those enterprises which are\nsituated in the corn districts are naturally able to offer better\nconditions, for the sake of which workmen are ready to\nleave their jobs and skilled workmen to do unskilled work,\nand the result can only be a drainage of good workmen away\nfrom the hungry central industrial districts where they are\nmost of all needed.",
        "Summing up the facts collected in this chapter and in the\nfirst on the lack of things and the lack of men, I think the\neconomic crisis in Russia may be fairly stated as follows:\nOwing to the appalling condition of Russian transport, and\nowing to the fact that since 1914 Russia has been practically\nin a state of blockade, the towns have lost their power of\nsupplying, either as middlemen or as producers, the simplest\nneeds of the villages.  Partly owing to this, partly again\nbecause of the condition of transport, the towns are not\nreceiving the necessaries of life in sufficient quantities.  The\nresult of this is a serious fall in the productivity of labor, and\na steady flow of skilled and unskilled workmen from the\ntowns towards the villages, and from employments the\nexercise of which tends to assist the towns in recovering\ntheir old position as essential sources of supply to\nemployments that tend to have the opposite effect.  If this\ncontinues unchecked, it will make impossible the\nregeneration of Russian industry, and will result in the\nincreasing independence of the villages, which will tend to\nbecome entirely self-supporting communities, tilling the\nground in a less and less efficient manner, with ruder tools,\nwith less and less incentive to produce more than is wanted\nfor the needs of the village itself.  Russia, in these\ncircumstances, may sink into something very like barbarism,\nfor with the decay of the economic importance of the towns\nwould decay also their authority, and free-booting on a small\nand large scale would become profitable and not very\ndangerous.  It would be possible, no doubt, for foreigners to\ntrade with the Russians as with the natives of the cannibal\nislands, bartering  looking-glasses and cheap tools, but,\nshould such a state of things come to be, it would mean long\nyears of colonization, with all the new  possibilities and risks\ninvolved in the subjugation of a free people, before Western\nEurope could count once more on getting a considerable\nportion of its food from Russian corn lands.",
        "That is the position, those the natural tendencies at work.\nBut opposed to these tendencies are the united efforts of the\nCommunists and of those who, leaving the question of\nCommunism discreetly aside, work with them for the sake of\npreventing such collapse of Russian civilization.  They\nrecognize the existence of every one of the tendencies I have\ndescribed, but they are convinced that every one of these\ntendencies will be arrested.  They believe that the country",
        "will not conquer the town but the reverse.  So far from\nexpecting the unproductive stagnation described in the last\nparagraph, they think of Russia as of the natural food supply\nof Europe, which the Communists among them believe will,\nin course of time, be made up for “Working Men’s\nRepublics” (though, for the sake of their own Republic, they\nare not inclined to postpone trade with Europe until that\nepoch arrives).  At the very time when spades and sickles are\nwearing out or worn out, these men are determined that the\nfood output of Russia shall sooner or later be increased by\nthe introduction of better methods of agriculture and\nfarming on a larger scale.  We are witnessing in Russia the\nfirst stages of a titanic struggle, with on one side all the\nforces of nature leading apparently to an inevitable collapse\nof civilization, and on the other side nothing but the\nincalculable force of human will.",
