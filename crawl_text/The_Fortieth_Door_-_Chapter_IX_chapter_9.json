        "A WEDDING PRESENT",
        "In a room high in the palace a young girl was trying on a frock.\nBefore a tall pier glass she stood indifferently, one hip sagging to\nthe despair of the kneeling seamstress, her face turned listlessly\nfrom the image in the glass.",
        "Through the open window, banded with three bars, she looked into the\nrustling tops of palms, from which the yellow date fruit hung, and\nbeyond the palms the hot, bright, blue sky and the far towers of a\nminaret.",
        "“A bit more to the left, h’if you please, miss,” the woman entreated\nthrough a mouthful of pins, and apathetically the young figure\nmoved.",
        "“A bit of h’all right, now, that drape,” the woman chirped, sitting\nback on her heels to survey her work.",
        "She was an odd gnome-like figure, with a sharp nose on one side of\nher head and an outstanding knob of hair on the other. Into that\nknob the thin locks were so tightly strained that her pointed\nfeatures had an effect of popping out of bondage.",
        "She was London born, brought out by an English official’s wife as\ndressmaker to the children, remaining in Cairo as wife of a British\ncorporal. Since no children had resulted to require her care and\nthe corporal maintained his distaste for thrift, Mrs. Hendricks had\nresumed her old trade, and had become a familiar figure to many\nfashionable Turkish harems, slipping in and out morning and evening,\nsewing busily away behind the bars upon frocks that would have\ngraced a court ball, and lunching in familiar sociability with the\nfamily, sometimes having a bey or a captain or a pasha for a\nvis-à-vis when the men in the family dropped in for luncheon.",
        "As the girl did not turn her head she looked for approbation to the\nthird person in the room, a tall, severely handsome Frenchwoman in\nblack, whose face had the beauty of chiseled marble and the same\nquality of cold perfection. This was Madame de Coulevain, teacher of\nFrench and literature to the jeunes filles of Cairo, former\ngoverness of Aimée, returned now to her old room in the palace for\nthe wedding preparations.",
        "There was history behind madame’s sculptured face. In an incredibly\nimpulsive youth she had fled from France with a handsome captain of\nAlgerian dragoons; after a certain matter at cards he had ceased to\nbe a captain and became petty official in a Cairo importing house;\nlater yet, he became an invalid.",
        "Life, for the Frenchwoman, was a matter of paying for her husband’s\nillness, then for his funeral expenses, and then of continuing to\npay for the little one which the climate had required them to send\nto a convent in France.",
        "There was, at first, the hope of reunion, extinguished by each\nadded year. What could madame, unknown, unfriended, unaccredited,\naccomplish in France? The mere getting there was impossible–the\nlittle one required so much. Her daughter was no dependent upon\ncharity. And in Cairo madame had a clientèle, she commanded a price.\nAnd so for the child’s sake she taught and saved, concentrating now\nupon a dot, and feeding her heart with the dutifully phrased letters\narriving each week of the years, and the occasional photographs of\nan ever-growing, unknown young creature.",
        "It was to madame’s care that Aimée had been given when the\nmotherless girl had grown beyond old Miriam’s ministrations, and for\nnearly nine years in the palace madame had maintained her courteous\nand tactful supervision. Indeed, it was only this last year that\nmadame had undertaken new relations with the world outside,\nperceiving that Aimée would not longer require her.",
        "“Excellent,” she said now in her careful, unfamiliar English to Mrs.\nHendricks, and in French to Aimée she added, with a hint of\nasperity, “Do give her a word. She is trying to please you.”",
        "“It is very nice, Mrs. Hendricks,” said the girl dutifully, bringing\nher glance back from that far sky.",
        "The little seamstress was instantly all vivacity. “H’and now for the\nsash–shall we ’ave it so–or so?” she demanded, attaching the wisp\nof tulle experimentally.",
        "“As you wish it.... It is very nice,” Aimée repeated vaguely. She\npicked up a bit of the shimmering stuff and spread it curiously\nacross her fingers. A dinner gown.... When she wore this she would\nbe a wife.... The wife of Hamdi Bey.... A shiver went through her\nand she dropped the tulle swiftly.",
        "In ten days more....",
        "Gone was her first rush of sustaining compassion. Gone was her\nfear for her father and her tenderness to him. Only this numb\ncoldness, this dumb, helpless certainty of a destiny about to be\naccomplished.... Only this hopeless, useless brooding upon that\nstrange brief past.",
        "There was a stir at the door and on her shuffling, slippered feet\nold Miriam entered, handing some packages to Madame de Coulevain.\nThen she turned to revolve about the bright figure of her young\nmistress, her eyes glistening fondly, her dark fingers touching a\nsoft fold of silver ribbon, while under her breath she chanted in a\ncroon like a lullaby, “Beautiful as the dawn ... she will walk upon\nthe heart of her husband with foot of rose petals ... she will\ndazzle him with the beams of her eyes and with the locks of her\nhair, she will bind him to her ... beautiful as the dawn....”",
        "It was the marriage chant of Miriam’s native village, an old love\nsong that had come down the wind of centuries.",
        "Mrs. Hendricks, thrusting in the final pins, paid not the slightest\nattention and Madame de Coulevain displayed interest only in the\npackages. If she saw the stiffening of the girl’s face and the rigid\naversion of her eyes from the old nurse’s adulation she gave no\nsign.",
        "Towards Aimée’s moods madame preserved a calm and sensible\ndetachment. Never had she invited confidence, and for all the young\ngirl’s charm she had never taken her to her heart in the place of\nthat absent daughter. As if jealously she had held herself aloof\nfrom such devotion.",
        "Perhaps in Aimée’s indulged and petted childhood, with a fond pasha\nextolling her small triumphs, her dances, her score at tennis at the\nlegation, madame found a bitter contrast to the lot of that lonely\nchild in France. Certainly there was nothing in Aimée’s life then to\ninvite compassion, and later, during those hard, mutinous months of\nthe girl’s first veiling and seclusion, she had not tried to soften\nthe inevitable for her with a useless compassion.",
        "So now, perceiving this marriage as one more step in the\nirresistible march of destiny for her charge, she overlooked the\nyouthful fretting and offered the example of her own unmoved\nacceptance.",
        "“What diamonds!” she said now admiringly, holding up a pin, and,\nexamining the card. “From Seniha Hanum–the cousin of Hamdi Bey.”",
        "A moment more she held up the pin but the girl would not give it a\nlook.",
        "“And this, from the same jeweler’s,” continued madame, while the\ndressmaker was unfastening the frock, aided by Miriam, anxious that\nno scratch should mar that milk-white skin.",
        "“How droll–the box is wrapped in cloth, a cloth of plaid.”",
        "Aimée spun about. The dress fell, a glistening circle at her feet,\nand with regardless haste she tripped over it to madame.",
        "“How–strange!” she said breathlessly.",
        "A plaid ... A Scotch plaid. Memories of an erect, tartan-draped\nyoung figure, of a thin, bronzed face and dark hair where a tilted\ncap sat rakishly ... memories of smiling, boyish eyes, darkening\nwith sudden emotion ... memories of eager lips....",
        "She took the box from madame. Within the cloth lay a jeweler’s case\nand within the case a locket of heavily ornamented gold.",
        "Her heart beating, she opened it. For a moment she did not\nunderstand. Her own face–her own face smiling back. Yet unfamiliar,\nthat oddly piled hair, that black velvet ribbon about the throat....",
        "Murmuring, madame shared her wonder.",
        "It was Miriam’s cry of recognition that told them.",
        "“Thy mother–the grace of Allah upon her!–It is thy mother! Eh,\nthose bright eyes, that long, dark hair that I brushed the many hot\nnights upon the roof!”",
        "“But you are her image, Aimée,” murmured the Frenchwoman, but half\nunderstanding the nurse’s rapid gutturals, and then, “Your father’s\ngift?”",
        "With the box in her hands the girl turned from them, fearful of the\ntell-tale color in her cheeks. “But whose else–his thought, of\ncourse,” she stammered.",
        "That plaid was warning her of mystery.",
        "The dressmaker was creating a diversion. Leaving, she wished to\nconsult about the purchases for to-morrow’s work, and madame moved\ntowards the hall with her, talking in her careful English, while\nMiriam bent towards the dropped finery.",
        "Aimée slipped through another door, into the twilight of her\nbedroom, whose windows upon the street were darkened by those\nfine-wrought screens of wood. Swiftly she thrust the box from sight,\ninto the hollow in the mashrubiyeh made in old days to hold a water\nbottle where it could be cooled by breezes from the street.",
        "Leaning against the woodwork, her fingers curving through the tiny\nopenings, she stared toward the west. The sky was flushing. Broken\nby the circles, the squares, the minute interstices of the\nmashrubiyeh, she saw the city taking on the hues of sunset.",
        "Suddenly the cry of a muezzin from a nearby minaret came rising and\nfalling through the streets.",
        "“_La illahé illallah Mohammedun Ressoulallah–”",
        "The call swelled and died away and rose again ... There is no God\nbut the God and Mahomet is the Prophet of God ... From farther\ntowers it sounded, echoing and re-echoing, vibrant, insistent,\nfalling upon crowded streets, penetrating muffling walls.",
        "“_La illahé illallah–”",
        "In the avenue beneath her two Arabs, leading their camels to market,\nwere removing their shoes and going through the gestures of\nceremonial washing with the dust of the street.",
        "“_La illahé–”",
        "The city was ringing with it.",
        "The seamstress and the Frenchwoman, still talking, had passed down\nthe hall. In the next room Miriam’s lips were moving in pious\ntestimony.",
        "“_Ech hedu en la illahé–! I testify that there is no God but theGod.”",
        "In the street the Arabs were bowing towards the east, their heads\ntouching the earth.",
        "And in the window above them a girl was reading a note.",
        "The last call of the muezzin, falling from the tardy towers of Kait\nBey drifted faintly through the colored air. With resounding whacks\nthe Arabs were urging on their beast; Miriam, her prayers concluded,\nwas shaking out silks and tulle with a sidelong glance for that\nstill figure in the next room, pressing so close against the\nguarding screens.",
        "She could not see the pallor in the young face. She could not see\nthe tumult in the dark eyes. She could not see the note, crushed\nconvulsively against the beating breast, in the fingers which so few\nmoments ago had drawn it from the hiding place in the box.",
        "Ryder had not dared a personal letter. But clearly, and distinctly,\nhe stated the story of the Delcassés. He gave the facts which the\npasha admitted and the ingenious explanation of the two Aimées. And\nfor reference he gave the address of the Delcassé aunt and agent in\nFrance and of Ryder and McLean at the Agricultural Bank.",
        "The pasha did not dine with his daughter that night. He had been\navoiding her of late, a natural reaction from the strain of\ntoo-excessive gratitude. A man cannot be continually humble before\nthe young! And it was no pleasure to be reminded by her candid eyes\nof his late misfortunes and of her absurd reluctance towards\nmatrimony.",
        "As if this marriage were not the best thing for her! As if it were a\nhardship! To make sad eyes and draw a mouth because one is to be the\nwife of a rich general.... Irrational ... The little sweetmeat was\nirritating.",
        "To this point Tewfick’s buoyancy had brought him, and all the more\nhastily because of his eagerness to escape the pangs of that\nuncomfortable self-reproach. To Aimée, in her new clear-sightedness\nof misery, it was bitterly apparent that he was reconciled with her\nlot and careless of it.",
        "So blinded had been her young affection that it was a hard\nawakening, and she was too young, too cruelly involved, to feel for\nhis easy humors that amused tolerance of larger acquaintance with\nhuman nature. She had grown swiftly bitter and resentful, and deeply\ncold.",
        "And now this letter. It dazed her, like a flame of lightning before\nher eyes, and then, like lightning, it lit up the world with\nterrifying luridity. Fiery colored, unfamiliar, her life trembled\nabout her.",
        "Truth or lies? Custom and habit stirred incredulously to reject the\nsupposition. The romance, the adventure of youth, dared its swift\nacceptance. How could she know? Intuitively she shrank from any\nquestion to the pasha, realizing the folly and futility of exposing\nher suspicion. If he needed to lie, lie he would–and in her\nunderstanding of that, she read her own acceptance of the\npossibility of his needing to lie.",
        "Madame de Coulevain? Madame had never known her mother. Only old\nMiriam had known her mother and Miriam was the pasha’s slave. But\nthe old woman was unsuspecting now, and full of disarming comfort in\nthis marriage of her wild darling.",
        "Through dinner she planned the careless-seeming questions. And then\nin her negligée, as the old nurse brushed out her hair for the\nnight, “Dadi,” said the girl, in a faint voice, “am I truly like my\nmother?” and when Miriam had finished her fond protestation that\nthey were as like as two roses, as two white roses, bloom and bud,\nshe launched that little cunning phrase on which she had spent such\neager hoping.",
        "“And was I like her when I was little–when first she came to my\nfather?”",
        "“Eh–yes. Always thou wast the tiny image which Allah–Glory to his\nName!–had made of her,” came the nurse’s assurance.",
        "“I am glad,” said Aimée, in a trembling voice.",
        "She dared not press that more. Confronted with her unconscious\nadmission the old woman would destroy it, feigning some evasion. But\nthere it was, for as much as it was worth....",
        "Presently then, she found another question to slip into the old\nwoman’s narrative of the pasha’s grief.",
        "“Eh, to hear a man weep,” Miriam was murmuring. “Her beauty had set\nits spell upon him, and–”",
        "“And he lost her so soon. Three or four years only, was it not,\"\nventured Aimée, “that they had of life together?”",
        "It seemed that Miriam’s brush missed a stroke.",
        "“Years I forget,” the nurse muttered, “but tears I remember,” and\nshe began to talk of other things.",
        "But it seemed to Aimée that she had answered. As for that other\nmatter, of the dead Delcassé child, she dared not refer to it, lest\nMiriam tell the pasha. But how many times, she remembered, had she\nbeen told that she was her mother’s only one!",
        "Yet, oh, to know, to hear all the story, to learn Ryder’s discovery\nof it! It was all as strange and startling as a tale of Djinns. And\nthe life that it held out to her, the enchanted hope of freedom, of\naid–Oh, not again would she refuse his aid!",
        "She had no plans, no purposes. But that night over her\nhastily-donned frock she slipped the black street mantle and when at\nlast, after endless waiting, the murmuring old palace was safely\nstill and dark, she stole down the spiral stair and gained the\ngarden. And then, a phantom among its shadows, she fled to the rose\nbushes by the gate.",
        "Breathlessly she knelt and dug into the hiding place of that gate’s\nkey. To the furthest corner her fingers explored the hole, pushing\nfuriously against the earth. And then she drew back her hand and\ncrushed it against her face to check the nervous sobs.",
        "The hole was empty. The key was gone.",
