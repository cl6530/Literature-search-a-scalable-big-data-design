        "’Nonsense!’ said the official from the Admiralty.",
        "Sir Walter got up and left the room while we looked blankly at\nthe table.  He came back in ten minutes with a long face.  ’I have\nspoken to Alloa,’ he said.  ’Had him out of bed–very grumpy.  He\nwent straight home after Mulross’s dinner.’",
        "’But it’s madness,’ broke in General Winstanley.  ’Do you mean\nto tell me that that man came here and sat beside me for the best\npart of half an hour and that I didn’t detect the imposture?  Alloa\nmust be out of his mind.’",
        "’Don’t you see the cleverness of it?’ I said.  ’You were too\ninterested in other things to have any eyes.  You took Lord Alloa for\ngranted.  If it had been anybody else you might have looked more\nclosely, but it was natural for him to be here, and that put you all\nto sleep.’",
        "Then the Frenchman spoke, very slowly and in good English.",
        "’The young man is right.  His psychology is good.  Our enemies\nhave not been foolish!’",
        "He bent his wise brows on the assembly.",
        "’I will tell you a tale,’ he said.  ’It happened many years ago in\nSenegal.  I was quartered in a remote station, and to pass the time\nused to go fishing for big barbel in the river.  A little Arab mare\nused to carry my luncheon basket–one of the salted dun breed you\ngot at Timbuctoo in the old days.  Well, one morning I had good\nsport, and the mare was unaccountably restless.  I could hear her\nwhinnying and squealing and stamping her feet, and I kept soothing\nher with my voice while my mind was intent on fish.  I could see\nher all the time, as I thought, out of a corner of my eye, tethered\nto a tree twenty yards away.  After a couple of hours I began to\nthink of food.  I collected my fish in a tarpaulin bag, and moved\ndown the stream towards the mare, trolling my line.  When I got up\nto her I flung the tarpaulin on her back–’",
        "He paused and looked round.",
        "’It was the smell that gave me warning.  I turned my head and\nfound myself looking at a lion three feet off ...  An old man-eater,\nthat was the terror of the village ...  What was left of the mare, a\nmass of blood and bones and hide, was behind him.’",
        "’What happened?’ I asked.  I was enough of a hunter to know a\ntrue yarn when I heard it.",
        "’I stuffed my fishing-rod into his jaws, and I had a pistol.  Also\nmy servants came presently with rifles.  But he left his mark on me.’\nHe held up a hand which lacked three fingers.",
        "’Consider,’ he said.  ’The mare had been dead more than an hour,\nand the brute had been patiently watching me ever since.  I never\nsaw the kill, for I was accustomed to the mare’s fretting, and I\nnever marked her absence, for my consciousness of her was only of\nsomething tawny, and the lion filled that part.  If I could blunder\nthus, gentlemen, in a land where men’s senses are keen, why should\nwe busy preoccupied urban folk not err also?’",
        "Sir Walter nodded.  No one was ready to gainsay him.",
        "’But I don’t see,’ went on Winstanley.  ’Their object was to get\nthese dispositions without our knowing it.  Now it only required\none of us to mention to Alloa our meeting tonight for the whole\nfraud to be exposed.’",
        "Sir Walter laughed dryly.  ’The selection of Alloa shows their\nacumen.  Which of us was likely to speak to him about tonight?  Or\nwas he likely to open the subject?’",
        "I remembered the First Sea Lord’s reputation for taciturnity and\nshortness of temper.",
        "’The one thing that puzzles me,’ said the General, ’is what good\nhis visit here would do that spy fellow?  He could not carry away\nseveral pages of figures and strange names in his head.’",
        "’That is not difficult,’ the Frenchman replied.  ’A good spy is\ntrained to have a photographic memory.  Like your own Macaulay.\nYou noticed he said nothing, but went through these papers again\nand again.  I think we may assume that he has every detail stamped\non his mind.  When I was younger I could do the same trick.’",
        "’Well, I suppose there is nothing for it but to change the plans,’\nsaid Sir Walter ruefully.",
        "Whittaker was looking very glum.  ’Did you tell Lord Alloa what\nhas happened?’ he asked.  ’No?  Well, I can’t speak with absolute\nassurance, but I’m nearly certain we can’t make any serious change\nunless we alter the geography of England.’",
        "’Another thing must be said,’ it was Royer who spoke.  ’I talked\nfreely when that man was here.  I told something of the military\nplans of my Government.  I was permitted to say so much.  But that\ninformation would be worth many millions to our enemies.  No, my\nfriends, I see no other way.  The man who came here and his\nconfederates must be taken, and taken at once.’",
        "’Good God,’ I cried, ’and we have not a rag of a clue.’",
        "’Besides,’ said Whittaker, ’there is the post.  By this time the news\nwill be on its way.’",
        "’No,’ said the Frenchman.  ’You do not understand the habits\nof the spy.  He receives personally his reward, and he delivers\npersonally his intelligence.  We in France know something of the\nbreed.  There is still a chance, MES AMIS.  These men must cross\nthe sea, and there are ships to be searched and ports to be\nwatched.  Believe me, the need is desperate for both France and Britain.’",
        "Royer’s grave good sense seemed to pull us together.  He was the\nman of action among fumblers.  But I saw no hope in any face, and\nI felt none.  Where among the fifty millions of these islands and\nwithin a dozen hours were we to lay hands on the three cleverest\nrogues in Europe?",
        "Then suddenly I had an inspiration.",
        "’Where is Scudder’s book?’ I cried to Sir Walter.  ’Quick, man, I\nremember something in it.’",
        "He unlocked the door of a bureau and gave it to me.",
        "I found the place.  THIRTY-NINE STEPS, I read, and again, THIRTY-NINE\nSTEPS–I COUNTED THEM–HIGH TIDE 10.17 P.M.",
        "The Admiralty man was looking at me as if he thought I had\ngone mad.",
        "’Don’t you see it’s a clue,’ I shouted.  ’Scudder knew where these\nfellows laired–he knew where they were going to leave the\ncountry, though he kept the name to himself.  Tomorrow was the\nday, and it was some place where high tide was at 10.17.’",
        "’They may have gone tonight,’ someone said.",
        "’Not they.  They have their own snug secret way, and they won’t\nbe hurried.  I know Germans, and they are mad about working to a\nplan.  Where the devil can I get a book of Tide Tables?’",
        "Whittaker brightened up.  ’It’s a chance,’ he said.  ’Let’s go over\nto the Admiralty.’",
        "We got into two of the waiting motor-cars–all but Sir Walter,\nwho went off to Scotland Yard–to ’mobilize MacGillivray’, so he said.\nWe marched through empty corridors and big bare chambers\nwhere the charwomen were busy, till we reached a little room lined\nwith books and maps.  A resident clerk was unearthed, who\npresently fetched from the library the Admiralty Tide Tables.  I sat\nat the desk and the others stood round, for somehow or other I had\ngot charge of this expedition.",
        "It was no good.  There were hundreds of entries, and so far as I\ncould see 10.17 might cover fifty places.  We had to find some way\nof narrowing the possibilities.",
        "I took my head in my hands and thought.  There must be some\nway of reading this riddle.  What did Scudder mean by steps?  I\nthought of dock steps, but if he had meant that I didn’t think he\nwould have mentioned the number.  It must be some place where\nthere were several staircases, and one marked out from the others\nby having thirty-nine steps.",
        "Then I had a sudden thought, and hunted up all the steamer\nsailings.  There was no boat which left for the Continent at 10.17 p.m.",
        "Why was high tide so important?  If it was a harbour it must be\nsome little place where the tide mattered, or else it was a heavy-\ndraught boat.  But there was no regular steamer sailing at that hour,\nand somehow I didn’t think they would travel by a big boat from a\nregular harbour.  So it must be some little harbour where the tide\nwas important, or perhaps no harbour at all.",
        "But if it was a little port I couldn’t see what the steps signified.\nThere were no sets of staircases on any harbour that I had ever\nseen.  It must be some place which a particular staircase identified,\nand where the tide was full at 10.17.  On the whole it seemed to me\nthat the place must be a bit of open coast.  But the staircases kept\npuzzling me.",
        "Then I went back to wider considerations.  Whereabouts would a\nman be likely to leave for Germany, a man in a hurry, who wanted\na speedy and a secret passage?  Not from any of the big harbours.\nAnd not from the Channel or the West Coast or Scotland, for,\nremember, he was starting from London.  I measured the distance\non the map, and tried to put myself in the enemy’s shoes.  I\nshould try for Ostend or Antwerp or Rotterdam, and I should\nsail from somewhere on the East Coast between Cromer and Dover.",
        "All this was very loose guessing, and I don’t pretend it was\ningenious or scientific.  I wasn’t any kind of Sherlock Holmes.  But I\nhave always fancied I had a kind of instinct about questions like\nthis.  I don’t know if I can explain myself, but I used to use my\nbrains as far as they went, and after they came to a blank wall I\nguessed, and I usually found my guesses pretty right.",
        "So I set out all my conclusions on a bit of Admiralty paper.  They\nran like this:",
