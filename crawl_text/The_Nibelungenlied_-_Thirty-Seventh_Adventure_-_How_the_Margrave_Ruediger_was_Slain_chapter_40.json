        "At morning light the strangers / had wrought high deed of fame,\nWhen the spouse of Gotelinde / unto the courtyard came.\nTo behold on both sides / such woe befallen there,\nMight not refrain from weeping / sorely the faithful Ruediger.",
        "2136",
        "“O woe is me!” exclaimed he, / “that ever I was born.\nAlack that this great sorrow / no hand from us may turn!\nThough I be ne’er so willing, / the king no peace will know,\nFor he beholds his sorrow / ever great and greater grow.”",
        "2137",
        "Then did the kindly Ruediger / unto Dietrich send,\nIf to the lofty monarchs / they yet might truce extend.\nThe knight of Bern gave message: / “How might such thing be?\nFor ne’er the royal Etzel / granteth to end it peacefully.”",
        "2138",
        "When a Hunnish warrior / saw standing Ruediger\nAs from eyes sore weeping / fell full many a tear,\nTo his royal mistress spake he: / “Behold how stands he there\nWith whom here by Etzel / none other may in might compare,",
        "2139",
        "“And who commandeth service / of lands and people all.\nHow many lordly castles / Ruediger his own doth call,\nThat unto him hath given / the bounty of the king!\nNot yet in valorous conflict / saw’st thou here his sword to swing.",
        "2140",
        "“Methinks, but little recks he, / what may here betide,\nSince now in fullest measure / his heart is satisfied.\n’Tis told he is, surpassing / all men, forsooth, so keen,\nBut in this time of trials / his valor ill-displayed hath been.”",
        "2141",
        "Stood there full of sorrow / the brave and faithful man,\nYet whom he thus heard speaking / he cast his eyes upon.\nThought he: “Thou mak’st atonement, / who deem’st my mettle cold.\nThy thought here all too loudly / hast thou unto the people told.”",
        "2142",
        "His fist thereat he doubled / and upon him ran,\nAnd smote with blow so mighty / there King Etzel’s man\nThat prone before him straightway / fell that mocker dead.\nSo came but greater sorrow / on the royal Etzel’s head.",
        "2143",
        "“Hence thou basest caitiff,\" / cried then Ruediger;\n“Here of pain and sorrow / enough I have to bear.\nWherefore wilt thou taunt me / that I the combat shun?\nIn sooth had I the utmost / of harm upon the strangers done,",
        "2144",
        "“For that good reason have I / to bear them hate indeed,\nBut that myself the warriors / as friends did hither lead.\nYea, was I their safe escort / into my master’s land;\nSo may I, man most wretched, / ne’er raise against them hostile hand.”",
        "2145",
        "Then spake the lofty Etzel / unto the margrave:\n“What aid, O noble Ruediger, / here at thy hands we have!\nOur country hath so many / already doomed to die,\nWe need not any other: / now hast thou wrought full wrongfully.”",
        "2146",
        "Returned the knight so noble: / “My heart he sore hath grieved,\nAnd reproached me for high honors / at thy hand received\nAnd eke for gifts unto me / by thee so freely made;\nDearly for his slander / hath the base traducer paid.”",
        "2147",
        "When had the queen come hither / and had likewise seen\nHow on the Hunnish warrior / his wrath had vented been,\nIncontinent she mourned it, / and tears bedimmed her sight.\nSpake she unto Ruediger: / “How dost thou now our love requite,",
        "2148",
        "“That for me and thy master / thou bring’st increase of woe?\nNow hast thou, noble Ruediger, / ever told us so,\nHow that thou life and honor / for our sake wouldst dare.\nEke heard I thanes full many / proclaim thee knight beyond compare.",
        "2149",
        "“Of the oath I now remind thee / that thou to me didst swear,\nWhen counsel first thou gavest / to Etzel’s land to fare,\nThat thou wouldst truly serve me / till one of us were dead:\nOf that I wretched woman / never stood so sore in need.”",
        "2150",
        "“Nor do I, royal mistress, / deny that so I sware\nThat I for thy well-being / would life and honor dare:\nBut eke my soul to forfeit, / –that sware I not indeed.\n’Tis I thy royal brothers / hither to this land did lead.”",
        "2151",
        "Quoth she: “Bethink thee, Ruediger, / of thy fidelity\nAnd oath once firmly plighted / that aught of harm to me\nShould ever be avenged, / and righted every ill.\"\nReplied thereto the margrave: / “Ne’er have I failed to work thy will.”",
        "2152",
        "Etzel the mighty monarch / to implore him then began,\nAnd king and queen together / down knelt before their man,\nWhereat the good margrave / was seen in sorest plight,\nAnd gan to mourn his station / in piteous words the faithful knight.",
        "2153",
        "“O woe is me most wretched,\" / he sorrow-stricken cried,\n“That forced I am my honor / thus to set aside,\nAnd bonds of faith and friendship / God hath imposed on me.\nO Thou that rul’st in heaven! / come death, I cannot yet be free.",
        "2154",
        "“Whate’er it be my effort / to do or leave undone,\nI break both faith and honor / in doing either one;\nBut leave I both, all people / will cry me worthy scorn.\nMay He look down in mercy / who bade me wretched man be born!”",
        "2155",
        "With many a prayer besought him / the king and eke his spouse,\nWherefore was many a warrior / soon doomed his life to lose\nAt hand of noble Ruediger, / when eke did die the thane.\nNow hear ye how he bore him, / though filled his heart with sorest pain.",
        "2156",
        "He knew how scathe did wait him / and boundless sorrowing,\nAnd gladly had refused / to obey the king\nAnd eke his royal mistress. / Full sorely did he fear,\nThat if one stranger slew he, / the scorn of all the world he’d bear.",
        "2157",
        "Then spake unto the monarch / the full gallant thane:\n“O royal sire, whatever / thou gavest, take again,\nThe land and every castle, / that naught remain to me.\nOn foot a lonely pilgrim / I’ll wander to a far country.”",
        "2158",
        "Thereto replied King Etzel: / “Who then gave help to me?\nMy land and lordly castles / give I all to thee,\nIf on my foes, O Ruediger, / revenge thou wilt provide.\nA mighty monarch seated, / shalt thou be by Etzel’s side.”",
        "2159",
        "Again gave answer Ruediger: / “How may that ever be?\nAt my own home shared they / my hospitality.\nMeat and drink I offered / to them in friendly way,\nAnd gave them of my bounty: / how shall I seek them here to slay ?",
        "2160",
        "“The folk belike will fancy / that I a coward be.\nNe’er hath faithful service / been refused by me\nUnto the noble princes / and their warriors too;\nThat e’er I gained their friendship, / now ’tis cause for me to rue.",
        "2161",
        "“For spouse unto Sir Giselher / gave I a daughter mine,\nNor into fairer keeping / might I her resign,\nWhere truth were sought and honor / and gentle courtesy:\nNe’er saw I thane so youthful / virtuous in mind as he.”",
        "2162",
        "Again gave answer Kriemhild: / “O noble Ruediger,\nTo me and royal Etzel / in mercy now give ear\nFor sorrows that o’erwhelm us. / Bethink thee, I implore,\nThat monarch never any / harbored so evil guests before.”",
        "2163",
        "Spake in turn the margrave / unto the monarch’s wife:\n“Ruediger requital / must make to-day with life\nFor that thou and my master / did me so true befriend.\nTherefore must I perish; / now must my service find an end.",
        "2164",
        "“E’en this day, well know I, / my castles and my land\nMust surely lose their master / beneath a stranger’s hand.\nTo thee my wife and children / commend I for thy care,\nAnd with all the lorn ones / that wait by Bechelaren’s towers fair.”",
        "2165",
        "“Now God reward thee, Ruediger,\" / thereat King Etzel quoth.\nHe and the queen together, / right joyful were they both.\n“To us shall all thy people / full commended be;\nEke trow I by my fortune / no harm shall here befall to thee.”",
        "2166",
        "For their sake he ventured / soul and life to lose.\nThereat fell sore to weeping / the royal Etzel’s spouse.\nHe spake: “I must unto you / my plighted word fulfil.\nAlack! beloved strangers, / whom to assail forbids my will.”",
        "2167",
        "From the king there parting / ye saw him, sad of mood,\nAnd passed unto his warriors / who at small distance stood.\n“Don straightway now your armor, / my warriors all,” quoth he.\n“Alas! must I to battle / with the valiant knights of Burgundy.”",
        "2168",
        "Then straightway for their armor / did the warriors call.\nA shining helm for this one, / for that a shield full tall\nSoon did the nimble squires / before them ready hold.\nAnon came saddest tidings / unto the stranger warriors bold.",
        "2169",
        "With Ruediger there saw ye / five hundred men arrayed,\nAnd noble thanes a dozen / that came unto his aid,\nThinking in storm of battle / to win them honor high.\nIn sooth but little knew they / how death awaited them so nigh.",
        "2170",
        "With helm on head advancing / saw ye Sir Ruediger.\nSwords that cut full keenly / the margrave’s men did bear,\nAnd eke in hand each carried / a broad shield shining bright.\nBoundless was the Fiddler’s / sorrow to behold the sight.",
        "2171",
        "When saw the youthful Giselher / his bride’s sire go\nThus with fastened helmet, / how might he ever know\nWhat he therewith did purpose / if ’twere not only good?\nThereat the noble monarchs / right joyous might ye see of mood.",
        "2172",
        "“I joy for friends so faithful,\" / spake Giselher the thane,\n“As on our journey hither / we for ourselves did gain.\nFull great shall be our vantage / that I found spouse so dear,\nAnd high my heart rejoiceth / that plighted thus to wed we were.”",
        "2173",
        "“Small cause I see for comfort,\" / thereto the minstrel spake.\n“When saw ye thanes so many / come a truce to make\nWith helmet firmly fastened / and bearing sword in hand?\nBy scathe to us will Ruediger / service do for tower and land.”",
        "2174",
        "The while that thus the Fiddler / had spoken to the end,\nHis way the noble Ruediger / unto the hall did wend.\nHis trusty shield he rested / on the ground before his feet,\nYet might he never offer / his friends in kindly way to greet.",
        "2175",
        "Loudly the noble margrave / cried into the hall:\n“Now guard you well, ye valiant / Nibelungen all.\nFrom me ye should have profit: / now have ye harm from me.\nBut late we plighted friendship: / broken now these vows must be.”",
        "2176",
        "Then quailed to hear such tidings / those knights in sore distress,\nFor none there was among them / but did joy the less\nThat he would battle with them / for whom great love they bore.\nAt hand of foes already / had they suffered travail sore.",
        "2177",
        "“Now God in heaven forfend it,\" / there King Gunther cried,\n“That from mercy to us / thou so wilt turn aside,\nAnd the faithful friendship / whereof hope had we.\nI trow in sooth that never / may such thing be done by thee.”",
        "2178",
        "“Desist therefrom I may not,\" / the keen knight made reply,\n“But now must battle with you, / for vow thereto gave I.\n“Now guard you, gallant warriors, / as fear ye life to lose:\nFrom plighted vow release me / will nevermore King Etzel’s spouse.”",
        "2179",
        "“Too late thou turnst against us,\" / spake King Gunther there.\n“Now might God requite thee, / O noble Ruediger,\nFor the faith and friendship / thou didst on us bestow,\nIf thou a heart more kindly / even to the end wouldst show.",
        "2180",
        "“We’d ever make requital / for all that thou didst give,–\nI and all my kinsmen, / wouldst thou but let us live,–\nFor thy gifts full stately, / as faithfully thou here\nTo Etzel’s land didst lead us: / know that, O noble Ruediger.”",
        "2181",
        "“To me what pleasure were it,\" / Ruediger did say,\n“With full hand of my treasure / unto you to weigh\nAnd with a mind right willing / as was my hope to do!\nThus might no man reproach me / with lack of courtesy to you.”",
        "2182",
        "“Turn yet, O noble Ruediger.\" / Gernot spake again,\n“For in so gracious manner / did never entertain\nAny host the stranger, / as we were served by thee;\nAnd live we yet a little, / shall thou well requited be.”",
        "2183",
        "“O would to God, full noble / Gernot,” spake Ruediger,\n“That ye were at Rhine river / and that dead I were\nWith somewhat saved of honor, / since I must be your foe!\nUpon good knights was never / wrought by friends more bitter woe.”",
        "2184",
        "“Now God requite thee, Ruediger,\" / Gernot gave reply,\n“For gifts so fair bestowed. / I rue to see thee die,\nFor that in thee shall perish / knight of so gentle mind.\nHere thy sword I carry, / that gav’st thou me in friendship kind.",
        "2185",
        "“It never yet hath failed me / in this our sorest need,\nAnd ’neath its cutting edges / many a knight lies dead.\n’Tis strong and bright of lustre, / cunning wrought and well.\nI ween, whate’er was given / by knight it doth in worth excel.",
        "2186",
        "“An wilt thou not give over / upon us here to fall,\nAnd if one friend thou slayest / here yet within this hall,\nWith this same sword thou gavest, / I’ll take from thee thy life.\nI sorrow for thee Ruediger, / and eke thy fair and stately wife.”",
        "2187",
        "“Would God but give, Sir Gernot, / that such thing might be,\nThat thou thy will completely / here fulfilled mightst see,\nAnd of thy friends not any / here his life should lose!\nYea, shalt thou live to comfort / both my daughter and my spouse.”",
        "2188",
        "Then out spake of Burgundy / the son of Ute fair:\n“How dost thou so, Sir Ruediger? / All that with me are\nTo thee are well disposed. / Thou dost an evil thing,\nAnd wilt thine own fair daughter / to widowhood too early bring.",
        "2189",
        "“If thou with armed warriors / wilt thus assail me here,\nIn what unfriendly manner / thou makest to appear\nHow that in thee I trusted / beyond all men beside,\nWhen thy fairest daughter / erstwhile I won to be my bride.”",
        "2190",
        "“Thy good faith remember, / O Prince of virtue rare,\nIf God from hence do bring thee,\" / –so spake Ruediger:\n“Forsake thou not the maiden / when bereft of me,\nBut rather grant thy goodness / be dealt to her more graciously.”",
        "2191",
        "“That would I do full fairly,\" / spake Giselher again.\n“But if my lofty kinsmen, / who yet do here remain,\nBeneath thy hand shall perish, / severed then must be\nThe friendship true I cherish / eke for thy daughter and for thee.”",
        "2192",
        "“Then God to us give mercy,\" / the knight full valiant spake.\nTheir shields in hand then took they, / as who perforce would make\nTheir passage to the strangers / into Kriemhild’s hall.\nAdown the stair full loudly / did Hagen, knight of Tronje, call:",
        "2193",
        "“Tarry yet a little, / O noble Ruediger,\nFor further would we parley,\" / –thus might ye Hagen hear–\n“I and my royal masters, / as presseth sorest need.\nWhat might it boot to Etzel / that we strangers all lay dead.",
        "2194",
        "“Great is here my trouble,\" / Hagen did declare:\n“The shield that Lady Gotelinde / gave to me to bear\nHath now been hewn asunder / by Hun-men in my hand.\nWith friendly thought I bore it / hither into Etzel’s land.",
        "2195",
        "“Would that God in heaven / might grant in kindliness,\nThat I a shield so trusty / did for my own possess\nAs in thy hand thou bearest, / O noble Ruediger!\nIn battle-storm then need I / never hauberk more to wear.”",
        "2196",
        "“Full glad I’d prove my friendship / to thee with mine own shield,\nDared I the same to offer / before Lady Kriemhild.\nBut take it, natheless, Hagen, / and bear it in thy hand.\nWould that thou mightst take it / again unto Burgundian land!”",
        "2197",
        "When with mind so willing / he offered him his shield,\nSaw ye how eyes full many / with scalding tears were filled;\nFor the last gift was it / that was offered e’er\nUnto any warrior / by Bechelaren’s margrave, Ruediger.",
        "2198",
        "How grim soe’er was Hagen / and stern soe’er of mind,\nThat gift to pity moved him / that there the chieftain kind,\nSo near his latest moment, / did on him bestow.\nFrom eyes of many another / began likewise the tears to flow.",
        "2199",
        "“Now God in heaven requite thee, / O noble Ruediger!\nLike unto thee none other / warrior was there e’er,\nUnto knights all friendless / so bounteously to give.\nGod grant in his mercy / thy virtue evermore to live.",
        "2200",
        "“Woe’s me to hear such tiding,\" / Hagen did declare.\n“Such load of grief abiding / already do we bear,\nIf we with friends must struggle, / to God our plaint must be.\"\nThereto replied the margrave: / “’Tis cause of sorrow sore to me.”",
        "2201",
        "“To pay thee for thy favor, / O noble Ruediger,\nHowe’er these lofty warriors / themselves against thee bear,\nYet never thee in combat / here shall touch my hand,\nE’en though complete thou slayest / them from out Burgundian land.”",
        "2202",
        "Thereat the lofty Ruediger / ’fore him did courteous bend.\nOn all sides was lamenting / that no man might end\nThese so great heart-sorrows / that sorely they must bear.\nThe father of all virtue / fell with noble Ruediger.",
        "2203",
        "Then eke the minstrel Volker / from hall down glancing said:\n“Since Hagen thus, my comrade, / peace with thee hath made,\nLasting truce thou likewise / receivest from my hand.\nWell hast thou deserved it / as fared we hither to this land.",
        "2204",
        "“Thou, O noble margrave, / my messenger shalt be.\nThese arm-bands ruddy golden / thy lady gave to me,\nThat here at this high festival / I the same should wear.\nNow mayst thyself behold them / and of my faith a witness bear.”",
        "2205",
        "“Would God but grant,\" / spake Ruediger, “who ruleth high in heaven,\nThat to thee by my lady / might further gift be given!\nI’ll gladly tell thy tidings / to spouse full dear to me,\nAn I but live to see her: / from doubt thereof thou mayst be free.”",
        "2206",
        "When thus his word was given, / his shield raised Ruediger.\nNigh to madness driven / bode he no longer there,\nBut ran upon the strangers / like to a valiant knight.\nMany a blow full rapid / smote the margrave in his might.",
        "2207",
        "Volker and Hagen / made way before the thane,\nAs before had promised / to him the warriors twain.\nYet found he by the portal / so many a valiant man\nThat Ruediger the combat / with mickle boding sore began.",
        "2208",
        "Gunther and Gernot / with murderous intent\nLet him pass the portal, / as knights on victory bent.\nBackward yielded Giselher, / with sorrow all undone;\nHe hoped to live yet longer, / and therefore Ruediger would shun.",
        "2209",
        "Straight upon their enemies / the margrave’s warriors sprung,\nAnd following their master / was seen a valiant throng.\nSwords with cutting edges / did they in strong arm wield,\n’Neath which full many a helmet / was cleft, and many a fair wrought\n      shield.",
        "2210",
        "The weary strangers likewise / smote many a whirring slash,\nWherefrom the men of Bechelaren / felt deep and long the gash\nThrough the shining ring-mail / e’en to their life’s core.\nIn storm of battle wrought they / glorious deeds a many more.",
        "2211",
        "All his trusty followers / now eke had gained the hall,\nOn whom Volker and Hagen / did soon in fury fall,\nAnd mercy unto no man / save Ruediger they showed.\nThe blood adown through helmets, / where smote their swords, full\n      plenteous flowed.",
        "2212",
        "How right furiously / were swords ’gainst armor driven!\nOn shields the well-wrought mountings / from their wards were riven,\nAnd fell their jewelled facings / all scattered in the blood.\nNe’er again might warriors / show in fight so grim a mood.",
        "2213",
        "The lord of Bechelaren / through foemen cut his way,\nAs doth each doughty warrior / in fight his might display.\nOn that day did Ruediger / show full plain that he\nA hero was undaunted, / full bold and eke full praiseworthy.",
        "2214",
        "Stood there two knights right gallant, / Gunther and Gernot,\nAnd in the storm of battle / to death full many smote.\nEke Giselher and Dankwart, / never aught recked they\nHow many a lusty fighter / saw ’neath their hand his latest day.",
        "2215",
        "Full well did show him Ruediger / a knight of mettle true,\nDoughty in goodly armor. / What warriors there he slew!\nBeheld it a Burgundian, / and cause for wrath was there.\nNot longer now was distant / the death of noble Ruediger.",
        "2216",
        "Gernot, knight full doughty, / addressed the margrave then,\nThus speaking to the hero: / “Wilt thou of all my men\nLiving leave not any, / O noble Ruediger?\nThat gives me grief unmeasured; / the sight I may not longer bear.",
        "2217",
        "“Now must thy gift unto me / prove thy sorest bane,\nSince of my friends so many / thou from me hast ta’en.\nNow hither turn to front me, / thou bold and noble knight:\nAs far as might may bear me / I trust to pay thy gift aright.”",
        "2218",
        "Ere that full the margrave / might make his way to him,\nMust rings of glancing mail-coats / with flowing blood grow dim.\nThen sprang upon each other / those knights on honor bent,\nAnd each from wounds deep cutting / sought to keep him all unshent.",
        "2219",
        "Their swords cut so keenly / that might withstand them naught.\nWith mighty arm Sir Ruediger / Gernot then smote\nThrough the flint-hard helmet, / that downward flowed the blood.\nTherefor repaid him quickly / the knight of keen and valiant mood.",
        "2220",
        "The gift he had of Ruediger / high in hand he swung,\nAnd though to death was wounded / he smote with blow so strong\nThat the good shield was cloven / and welded helmet through.\nThe spouse of fair Gotelinde, / then his latest breath he drew.",
        "2221",
        "In sooth so sad requital / found rich bounty ne’er.\nSlain fell they both together, / Gernot and Ruediger,\nAlike in storm of battle, / each by the other’s hand.\nSore was the wrath of Hagen / when he the harm did understand.",
        "2222",
        "Cried there the lord of Tronje: / “Great is here our loss.\nIn death of these two heroes / such scathe befalleth us,\nWherefor land and people / shall repine for aye.\nThe warriors of Ruediger / must now to us the forfeit pay.”",
        "2223",
        "“Alack for this my brother, / snatched by death this day!\nWhat host of woes unbidden / encompass me alway!\nEke must I moan it ever / that noble Ruediger fell.\nGreat is the scathe to both sides / and great the sorrowing as well.”",
        "2224",
        "When then beheld Sir Giselher / his lover’s sire dead,\nMust all that with him followed / suffer direst need.\nThere Death was busy seeking / to gather in his train,\nAnd of the men of Bechelaren / came forth not one alive again.",
        "2225",
        "Gunther and Giselher / and with them Hagen too,\nDankwart and Volker, / doughty thanes and true,\nWent where found they lying / the two warriors slain,\nNor at the sight the heroes / might their grief and tears restrain.",
        "2226",
        "“Death robbeth us right sorely,\" / spake young Sir Giselher:\n“Yet now give o’er your weeping / and let us seek the air,\nThat the ringed mail grow cooler / on us storm-weary men.\nGod in sooth will grant us / not longer here to live, I ween.”",
        "2227",
        "Here sitting, and there leaning / was seen full many a thane,\nResting once more from combat, / the while that all lay slain\nThe followers of Ruediger. / Hushed was the battle’s din.\nAt length grew angry Etzel, / that stillness was so long within.",
        "2228",
        "“Alack for such a service!\" / spake the monarch’s wife;\n“For never ’tis so faithful / that our foes with life\nMust to us make payment / at Ruediger’s hand.\nHe thinks in sooth to lead them / again unto Burgundian land.",
        "2229",
        "“What boots it, royal Etzel, / that we did ever share\nWith him what he desired? / The knight doth evil there.\nHe that should avenge us, / the same a truce doth make.\"\nThereto the stately warrior / Volker in answer spake:",
        "2230",
        "“Alas ’tis no such case here, / O high and royal dame.\nDared I but give the lie to / one of thy lofty name,\nThou hast in fiendish manner / Ruediger belied.\nHe and all his warriors / have laid all thoughts of truce aside.",
        "2231",
        "“With so good heart obeyed he / his royal master’s will\nThat he and all his followers / here in death lie still.\nLook now about thee, Kriemhild, / who may thy hests attend.\nRuediger the hero / hath served thee faithful to the end.",
        "2232",
        "“Wilt thou my words believe not, / to thee shall clear be shown.\"\nTo cause her heart a sorrow, / there the thing was done.\nWound-gashed they bore the hero / where him the king might see.\nUnto the thanes of Etzel / ne’er might so great sorrow be.",
        "2233",
        "When did they the margrave / a corse on bier behold,\nBy chronicler might never / written be nor told\nAll the wild lamenting / of women and of men,\nAs with grief all stricken / out-poured they their hearts’ sorrow then.",
        "2234",
        "Royal Etzel’s sorrow / there did know no bound.\nLike to the voice of lion / echoing rang the sound\nOf the king’s loud weeping, / wherein the queen had share.\nUnmeasured they lamented / the death of noble Ruediger.",
