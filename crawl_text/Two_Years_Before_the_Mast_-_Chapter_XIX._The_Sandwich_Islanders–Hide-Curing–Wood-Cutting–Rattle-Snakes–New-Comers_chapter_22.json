        "Here was a change in my life as complete as it had been sudden.\nIn the twinkling of an eye, I was transformed from a sailor into a\n“beach-comber” and a hide-curer; yet the novelty and the comparative\nindependence of the life were not unpleasant.  Our hide-house was a\nlarge building, made of rough boards, and intended to hold forty\nthousand hides.  In one corner of it, a small room was parted off,\nin which four berths were made, where we were to live, with mother\nearth for our floor.  It contained a table, a small locker for pots,\nspoons, plates, etc., and a small hole cut to let in the light.\nHere we put our chests, threw our bedding into the berths, and took\nup our quarters.  Over our head was another small room, in which\nMr. Russell lived, who had charge of the hide-house; the same man\nwho was for a time an officer of the Pilgrim.  There he lived in\nsolitary grandeur; eating and sleeping alone, (and these were his\nprincipal occupations,) and communing with his own dignity.\nThe boy was to act as cook; while myself, a giant of a Frenchman\nnamed Nicholas, and four Sandwich Islanders, were to cure the hides.\nSam, the Frenchman, and myself, lived together in the room, and the\nfour Sandwich Islanders worked and ate with us, but generally slept\nat the oven.  My new messmate, Nicholas, was the most immense man\nthat I had ever seen in my life.  He came on the coast in a vessel\nwhich was afterwards wrecked, and now let himself out to the\ndifferent houses to cure hides.  He was considerably over six\nfeet, and of a frame so large that he might have been shown\nfor a curiosity.  But the most remarkable thing about him was his\nfeet.  They were so large that he could not find a pair of shoes\nin California to fit him, and was obliged to send to Oahu for a\npair; and when he got them, he was compelled to wear them down at\nthe heel.  He told me once, himself, that he was wrecked in an\nAmerican brig on the Goodwin Sands, and was sent up to London,\nto the charge of the American consul, without clothing to his\nback or shoes to his feet, and was obliged to go about London\nstreets in his stocking feet three or four days, in the month\nof January, until the consul could have a pair of shoes made\nfor him.  His strength was in proportion to his size, and his\nignorance to his strength–\"strong as an ox, and ignorant as\nstrong.”  He neither knew how to read nor write.  He had been\nto sea from a boy, and had seen all kinds of service, and been\nin every kind of vessel: merchantmen, men-of-war, privateers,\nand slavers; and from what I could gather from his accounts of\nhimself, and from what he once told me, in confidence, after we\nhad become better acquainted, he had even been in worse business\nthan slave-trading.  He was once tried for his life in Charleston,\nSouth Carolina, and though acquitted, yet he was so frightened that\nhe never would show himself in the United States again; and I could\nnot persuade him that he could never be tried a second time for the\nsame offence.  He said he had got safe off from the breakers, and was\ntoo good a sailor to risk his timbers again.",
        "Though I knew what his life had been, yet I never had the slightest\nfear of him.  We always got along very well together, and, though\nso much stronger and larger than I, he showed a respect for\nmy education, and for what he had heard of my situation before\ncoming to sea.  “I’ll be good friends with you,” he used to say,\n“for by-and-by you’ll come out here captain, and then you’ll haze me\nwell!”  By holding well together, we kept the officer in good order,\nfor he was evidently afraid of Nicholas, and never ordered us,\nexcept when employed upon the hides.  My other companions,\nthe Sandwich Islanders, deserve particular notice.",
        "A considerable trade has been carried on for several years between\nCalifornia and the Sandwich Islands, and most of the vessels are\nmanned with Islanders; who, as they, for the most part, sign no\narticles, leave whenever they choose, and let themselves out to\ncure hides at San Diego, and to supply the places of the men of the\nAmerican vessels while on the coast.  In this way, quite a colony\nof them had become settled at San Diego, as their headquarters.\nSome of these had recently gone off in the Ayacucho and Loriotte,\nand the Pilgrim had taken Mr. Mannini and three others, so that\nthere were not more than twenty left.   Of these, four were on pay\nat the Ayacucho’s house, four more working with us, and the rest\nwere living at the oven in a quiet way; for their money was nearly\ngone, and they must make it last until some other vessel came down\nto employ them.",
        "During the four months that I lived here, I got well acquainted\nwith all of them, and took the greatest pains to become familiar\nwith their language, habits, and characters.  Their language,\nI could only learn, orally, for they had not any books among them,\nthough many of them had been taught to read and write by the\nmissionaries at home.  They spoke a little English, and by a sort\nof compromise, a mixed language was used on the beach, which could be\nunderstood by all.  The long name of Sandwich Islanders is dropped,\nand they are called by the whites, all over the Pacific ocean,\n“Kanákas,” from a word in their own language which they apply to\nthemselves, and to all South Sea Islanders, in distinction from\nwhites, whom they call “Haole.”  This name, “Kanaka,” they answer to,\nboth collectively and individually.  Their proper names, in their\nown language, being difficult to pronounce and remember, they are\ncalled by any names which the captains or crews may choose to\ngive them.  Some are called after the vessel they are in; others\nby common names, as Jack, Tom, Bill; and some have fancy names,\nas Ban-yan, Fore-top, Rope-yarn, Pelican, etc., etc.  Of the four\nwho worked at our house one was named “Mr. Bingham,” after the\nmissionary at Oahu; another, Hope, after a vessel that he had been\nin; a third, Tom Davis, the name of his first captain; and the fourth,\nPelican, from his fancied resemblance to that bird.  Then there was\nLagoda-Jack, California-Bill, etc., etc.  But by whatever names\nthey might be called, they were the most interesting, intelligent,\nand kind-hearted people that I ever fell in with.  I felt a positive\nattachment for almost all of them; and many of them I have, to this\ntime, a feeling for, which would lead me to go a great way for the\nmere pleasure of seeing them, and which will always make me feel a\nstrong interest in the mere name of a Sandwich Islander.",
        "Tom Davis knew how to read, write, and cipher in common arithmetic;\nhad been to the United States, and spoke English quite well.\nHis education was as good as that of three-quarters of the Yankees\nin California, and his manners and principles a good deal better,\nand he was so quick of apprehension that he might have been taught\nnavigation, and the elements of many of the sciences, with the most\nperfect ease.  Old “Mr. Bingham” spoke very little English–almost\nnone, and neither knew how to read nor write; but he was the\nbest-hearted old fellow in the world.  He must have been over fifty\nyears of age, and had two of his front teeth knocked out, which was\ndone by his parents as a sign of grief at the death of Kamehameha,\nthe great king of the Sandwich Islands.  We used to tell him that he\nate Captain Cook, and lost his teeth in that way.  That was the only\nthing that ever made him angry.  He would always be quite excited\nat that; and say–\"Aole!” (no.)  “Me no eat Captain Cook!  Me\npikinini–small–so high–no more!  My father see Captain Cook!\nMe–no!”  None of them liked to have anything said about Captain\nCook, for the sailors all believe that he was eaten, and that,\nthey cannot endure to be taunted with.–\"New Zealand Kanaka eat\nwhite man;–Sandwich Island Kanaka–no.  Sandwich Island Kanaka\nua like pu na haole–all ’e same a’ you!”",
        "Mr. Bingham was a sort of patriarch among them, and was always\ntreated with great respect, though he had not the education and energy\nwhich gave Mr. Mannini his power over them.  I have spent hours in\ntalking with this old fellow about Kamehameha, the Charlemagne\nof the Sandwich Islands; his son and successor Riho Riho, who died\nin England, and was brought to Oahu in the frigate Blonde, Captain\nLord Byron, and whose funeral he remembered perfectly; and also\nabout the customs of his country in his boyhood, and the changes\nwhich had been made by the missionaries.  He never would allow that\nhuman beings had been eaten there; and, indeed, it always seemed\nlike an insult to tell so affectionate, intelligent, and civilized\na class of men, that such barbarities had been practised in their\nown country within the recollection of many of them.  Certainly,\nthe history of no people on the globe can show anything like so\nrapid an advance.  I would have trusted my life and my fortune in\nthe hands of any one of these people; and certainly had I wished\nfor a favor or act of sacrifice, I would have gone to them all,\nin turn, before I should have applied to one of my own countrymen\non the coast, and should have expected to have seen it done,\nbefore my own countrymen had got half through counting the cost.\nTheir costumes, and manner of treating one another, show a simple,\nprimitive generosity, which is truly delightful; and which is often\na reproach to our own people.  Whatever one has, they all have.\nMoney, food, clothes, they share with one another; even to the\nlast piece of tobacco to put in their pipes.  I once heard old\nMr. Bingham say, with the highest indignation, to a Yankee trader\nwho was trying to persuade him to keep his money to himself–\"No!\nWe no all ’e same a’ you!–Suppose one got money, all got money.\nYou;–suppose one got money–lock him up in chest.–No good!\"–\n“Kanaka all ’e same a’ one!”  This principle they carry so far,\nthat none of them will eat anything in the sight of others without\noffering it all round.  I have seen one of them break a biscuit,\nwhich had been given him, into five parts, at a time when I knew\nhe was on a very short allowance, as there was but little to eat\non the beach.",
        "My favorite among all of them, and one who was liked by both officers\nand men, and by whomever he had anything to do with, was Hope.\nHe was an intelligent, kind-hearted little fellow, and I never\nsaw him angry, though I knew him for more than a year, and have\nseen him imposed upon by white people, and abused by insolent\nofficers of vessels.  He was always civil, and always ready,\nand never forgot a benefit.  I once took care of him when he was ill,\ngetting medicines from the ship’s chests, when no captain or officer\nwould do anything for him, and he never forgot it.  Every Kanaka has\none particular friend, whom he considers himself bound to do\neverything for, and with whom he has a sort of contract,–an\nalliance offensive and defensive,–and for whom he will often make\nthe greatest sacrifices.  This friend they call aikane; and for such\ndid Hope adopt me.  I do not believe I could have wanted anything\nwhich he had, that he would not have given me.  In return for this,\nI was always his friend among the Americans, and used to teach\nhim letters and numbers; for he left home before he had learned\nhow to read.  He was very curious about Boston (as they call the\nUnited States); asking many questions about the houses, the people,\netc., and always wished to have the pictures in books explained to\nhim.  They were all astonishingly quick in catching at explanations,\nand many things which I had thought it utterly impossible to make\nthem understand, they often seized in an instant, and asked\nquestions which showed that they knew enough to make them wish to\ngo farther.  The pictures of steamboats and railroad cars, in the\ncolumns of some newspapers which I had, gave me great difficulty\nto explain.  The grading of the road, the rails, the construction of\nthe carriages, they could easily understand, but the motion produced\nby steam was a little too refined for them.  I attempted to show it\nto them once by an experiment upon the cook’s coppers, but failed;\nprobably as much from my own ignorance as from their want of\napprehension; and, I have no doubt, left them with about as clear\nan idea of the principle as I had myself.  This difficulty, of course,\nexisted in the same force with the steamboats and all I could do was\nto give them some account of the results, in the shape of speed; for,\nfailing in the reason, I had to fall back upon the fact.  In my account\nof the speed I was supported by Tom, who had been to Nantucket,\nand seen a little steamboat which ran over to New Bedford.",
        "A map of the world, which I once showed them, kept their attention\nfor hours; those who knew how to read pointing out the places\nand referring to me for the distances.  I remember being much\namused with a question which Hope asked me.  Pointing to the large\nirregular place which is always left blank round the poles, to\ndenote that it is undiscovered, he looked up and asked.–\"Pau?\"\n(Done? ended?)",
        "The system of naming the streets and numbering the houses, they\neasily understood, and the utility of it.  They had a great desire to\nsee America, but were afraid of doubling Cape Horn, for they suffer\nmuch in cold weather, and had heard dreadful accounts of the Cape,\nfrom those of their number who had been round it.",
        "They smoke a great deal, though not much at a time; using pipes\nwith large bowls, and very short stems, or no stems at all.  These,\nthey light, and putting them to their mouths, take a long draught,\ngetting their mouths as full as they can hold, and their cheeks\ndistended, and then let it slowly out through their mouths and nostrils.\nThe pipe is then passed to others, who draw, in the same manner,\none pipe-full serving for half a dozen.  They never take short,\ncontinuous draughts, like Europeans, but one of these “Oahu puffs,\"\nas the sailors call them, serves for an hour or two, until some one\nelse lights his pipe, and it is passed round in the same manner.\nEach Kanaka on the beach had a pipe, flint, steel, tinder, a hand\nof tobacco, and a jack-knife, which he always carried about with him.",
        "That which strikes a stranger most peculiarly is their style of\nsinging.  They run on, in a low, guttural, monotonous sort of chant,\ntheir lips and tongues seeming hardly to move, and the sounds modulated\nsolely in the throat.  There is very little tune to it, and the\nwords, so far as I could learn, are extempore.  They sing about\npersons and things which are around them, and adopt this method\nwhen they do not wish to be understood by any but themselves;\nand it is very effectual, for with the most careful attention I never\ncould detect a word that I knew.  I have often heard Mr. Mannini,\nwho was the most noted improvisatore among them, sing for an hour\ntogether, when at work in the midst of Americans and Englishmen;\nand, by the occasional shouts and laughter of the Kanakas,\nwho were at a distance, it was evident that he was singing about\nthe different men that he was at work with.  They have great powers\nof ridicule, and are excellent mimics; many of them discovering and\nimitating the peculiarities of our own people, before we had seen\nthem ourselves.",
        "These were the people with whom I was to spend a few months;\nand who, with the exception of the officer, Nicholas the Frenchman,\nand the boy, made the whole population of the beach.  I ought,\nperhaps, to except the dogs, for they were an important part of our\nsettlement.  Some of the first vessels brought dogs out with them,\nwho, for convenience, were left ashore, and there multiplied,\nuntil they came to be a great people.  While I was on the beach,\nthe average number was about forty, and probably an equal, or\ngreater number are drowned, or killed in some other way, every year.\nThey are very useful in guarding the beach, the Indians being afraid\nto come down at night; for it was impossible for any one to get within\nhalf a mile of the hide-houses without a general alarm.  The father\nof the colony, old Sachem, so called from the ship in which he was\nbrought out, died while I was there, full of years, and was honorably\nburied.  Hogs, and a few chickens, were the rest of the animal tribe,\nand formed, like the dogs, a common company, though they were all\nknown and marked, and usually fed at the houses to which they\nbelonged.",
        "I had been but a few hours on the beach, and the Pilgrim was\nhardly out of sight, when the cry of “Sail ho!” was raised, and a\nsmall hermaphrodite brig rounded the point, bore up into the harbor,\nand came to anchor.  It was the Mexican brig Fazio, which we\nhad left at San Pedro, and which had come down to land her tallow,\ntry it all over, and make new bags, and then take it in, and leave the\ncoast.  They moored ship, erected their try-works on shore, put up\na small tent, in which they all lived, and commenced operations.\nThey made an addition to our society, and we spent many evenings in\ntheir tent, where, amid the Babel of English, Spanish, French, Indian,\nand Kanaka, we found some words that we could understand in common.",
        "The morning after my landing, I began the duties of hide-curing.\nIn order to understand these, it will be necessary to give the whole\nhistory of a hide, from the time it is taken from a bullock until it\nis put on board the vessel to be carried to Boston.  When the hide\nis taken from the bullock, holes are cut round it, near the edge,\nby which it is staked out to dry.  In this manner it dries without\nshrinking.  After they are thus dried in the sun, they are received by\nthe vessels, and brought down to the depot at San Diego.  The vessels\nland them, and leave them in large piles near the houses.",
        "Then begins the hide-curer’s duty.  The first thing is to put them\nin soak.  This is done by carrying them down at low tide, and making\nthem fast, in small piles, by ropes, and letting the tide come up\nand cover them.  Every day we put in soak twenty-five for each\nman, which, with us, made an hundred and fifty.  There they\nlie forty-eight hours, when they are taken out, and rolled up,\nin wheelbarrows, and thrown into the vats.  These vats contain brine,\nmade very strong; being sea-water, with great quantities of salt thrown\nin.  This pickles the hides, and in this they lie forty-eight hours;\nthe use of the sea-water, into which they are first put, being merely\nto soften and clean them.  From these vats, they are taken, and lie on\na platform twenty-four hours, and then are spread upon the ground,\nand carefully stretched and staked out, so that they may dry smooth.\nAfter they were staked, and while yet wet and soft, we used to go\nupon them with our knives, and carefully cut off all the bad parts:–\nthe pieces of meat and fat, which would corrupt and infect the whole\nif stowed away in a vessel for many months, the large flippers,\nthe ears, and all other parts which would prevent close stowage.\nThis was the most difficult part of our duty: as it required much\nskill to take everything necessary off and not to cut or injure the hide.\nIt was also a long process, as six of us had to clean an hundred and\nfifty, most of which required a great deal to be done to them, as the\nSpaniards are very careless in skinning their cattle.  Then, too,\nas we cleaned them while they were staked out, we were obliged to\nkneel down upon them, which always gives beginners the back-ache.\nThe first day, I was so slow and awkward that I cleaned only eight;\nat the end of a few days I doubled my number; and in a fortnight or\nthree weeks, could keep up with the others, and clean my proportion\n–twenty-five.",
        "This cleaning must be got through with before noon; for by that\ntime they get too dry.  After the sun has been upon them a few\nhours, they are carefully gone over with scrapers, to get off all the\ngrease which the sun brings out.  This being done, the stakes are\npulled up, and the hides carefully doubled, with the hair side out,\nand left to dry.  About the middle of the afternoon they are turned\nupon the other side, and at sundown piled up and covered over.\nThe next day they are spread out and opened again, and at night,\nif fully dry, are thrown upon a long, horizontal pole, five at\na time, and beat with flails.  This takes all the dust from them.\nThen, being salted, scraped, cleaned, dried, and beaten, they are\nstowed away in the house.  Here ends their history, except that\nthey are taken out again when the vessel is ready to go home, beaten,\nstowed away on board, carried to Boston, tanned, made into shoes and\nother articles for which leather is used; and many of them, very probably,\nin the end, brought back again to California in the shape of shoes,\nand worn out in pursuit of other bullocks, or in the curing of\nother hides.",
        "By putting an hundred and fifty in soak every day, we had the\nsame number at each stage of curing, on each day; so that we had,\nevery day, the same work to do upon the same number: an hundred\nand fifty to put in soak; an hundred and fifty to wash out and put\nin the vat; the same number to haul from the vat and put on the\nplatform to drain; the same number to spread and stake out and\nclean; and the same number to beat and stow away in the home.\nI ought to except Sunday; for, by a prescription which no captain\nor agent has yet ventured to break in upon, Sunday has been a day\nof leisure on the beach for years.  On Saturday night, the hides,\nin every stage of progress, are carefully covered up, and not\nuncovered until Monday morning.  On Sundays we had absolutely\nno work to do, unless it was to kill a bullock, which was sent\ndown for our use about once a week, and sometimes came on Sunday.\nAnother good arrangement was, that we had just so much work to do,\nand when that was through, the time was our own.  Knowing this,\nwe worked hard, and needed no driving.  We “turned out” every\nmorning at the first signs of daylight, and allowing a short time,\nabout eight o’clock, for breakfast, generally got through our labor\nbetween one and two o’clock, when we dined, and had the rest of the\ntime to ourselves; until just before sundown, when we beat the dry\nhides and put them in the house, and covered over all the others.\nBy this means we had about three hours to ourselves every afternoon;\nand at sundown we had our supper, and our work was done for the day.\nThere was no watch to stand, and no topsails to reef.  The evenings\nwe generally spent at one another’s houses, and I often went up and\nspent an hour or so at the oven; which was called the “Kanaka Hotel,\"\nand the “Oahu Coffee-house.”  Immediately after dinner we usually\ntook a short siésta to make up for our early rising, and spent the\nrest of the afternoon according to our own fancies.  I generally\nread, wrote, and made or mended clothes; for necessity, the mother\nof invention, had taught me these two latter arts.  The Kanakas went\nup to the oven, and spent the time in sleeping, talking, and smoking;\nand my messmate, Nicholas, who neither knew how to read or write,\npassed away the time by a long siésta, two or three smokes with\nhis pipe, and a paséo to the other houses.  This leisure time is\nnever interfered with, for the captains know that the men earn it\nby working hard and fast, and that if they interfered with it,\nthe men could easily make their twenty-five hides apiece last\nthrough the day.  We were pretty independent, too, for the master\nof the house–\"capitan de la casa\"– had nothing to say to us,\nexcept when we were at work on the hides, and although we could\nnot go up to the town without his permission, this was seldom or\nnever refused.",
        "The great weight of the wet hides, which we were obliged to roll\nabout in wheelbarrows; the continual stooping upon those which\nwere pegged out to be cleaned; and the smell of the vats, into which\nwe were often obliged to get, knee-deep, to press down the hides;\nall made the work disagreeable and fatiguing;–but we soon got\nhardened to it, and the comparative independence of our life\nreconciled us to it; for there was nobody to haze us and find fault;\nand when we got through, we had only to wash and change our clothes,\nand our time was our own.  There was, however, one exception to the\ntime’s being our own; which was, that on two afternoons of every\nweek we were obliged to go off and get wood, for the cook to use\nin the galley.  Wood is very scarce in the vicinity of San Diego;\nthere being no trees of any size, for miles.  In the town,\nthe inhabitants burn the small wood which grows in thickets,\nand for which they send out Indians, in large numbers, every few days.\nFortunately, the climate is so fine that they had no need of a fire in\ntheir houses, and only use it for cooking.  With us the getting of\nwood was a great trouble; for all that in the vicinity of the houses\nhad been cut down, and we were obliged to go off a mile or two,\nand to carry it some distance on our backs, as we could not get the\nhand-cart up the hills and over the uneven places.  Two afternoons\nin the week, generally Monday and Thursday, as soon as we had got\nthrough dinner, we started off for the bush, each of us furnished\nwith a hatchet and a long piece of rope, and dragging the hand-cart\nbehind us, and followed by the whole colony of dogs, who were\nalways ready for the bush, and were half mad whenever they saw\nour preparations.  We went with the hand-cart as far as we could\nconveniently drag it, and leaving it in an open, conspicuous place,\nseparated ourselves; each taking his own course, and looking about\nfor some good place to begin upon.  Frequently, we had to go nearly\na mile from the hand-cart before we could find any fit place.\nHaving lighted upon a good thicket, the next thing was to clear\naway the under-brush, and have fair play at the trees.  These trees\nare seldom more than five or six feet high, and the highest that I\never saw in these expeditions could not have been more than twelve;\nso that, with lopping off the branches and clearing away the underwood,\nwe had a good deal of cutting to do for a very little wood.  Having cut\nenough for a “back-load,” the next thing was to make it well fast\nwith the rope, and heaving the bundle upon our backs, and taking\nthe hatchet in hand, to walk off, up hill and down dale, to the\nhand-cart.  Two good back-loads apiece filled the hand-cart;\nand that was each one’s proportion.  When each had brought down\nhis second load, we filled the hand-cart, and took our way again\nslowly back, and unloading, covering the hides for the night,\nand getting our supper, finished the day’s work.",
        "These wooding excursions had always a mixture of something\nrather pleasant in them.  Roaming about in the woods with hatchet\nin hand, like a backwoodsman, followed by a troop of dogs; starting\nup of birds, snakes, hares and foxes, and examining the various kinds\nof trees, flowers, and birds’ nests, was at least, a change from\nthe monotonous drag and pull on shipboard.  Frequently, too,\nwe had some amusement and adventure.  The coati, of which I have\nbefore spoken,–a sort of mixture of the fox and wolf breeds,–fierce\nlittle animals, with bushy tails and large heads, and a quick, sharp\nbark, abound here, as in all other parts of California.  These,\nthe dogs were very watchful for, and whenever they saw them,\nstarted off in full run after them.  We had many fine chases;\nyet, although our dogs ran finely, the rascals generally escaped.\nThey are a match for the dog,–-one to one,–but as the dogs\ngenerally went in squads, there was seldom a fair fight.  A smaller\ndog, belonging to us, once attacked a coati, single, and got a good\ndeal worsted, and might perhaps have been killed had we not come to\nhis assistance.  We had, however, one dog which gave them a good\ndeal of trouble, and many hard runs.  He was a fine, tall fellow,\nand united strength and agility better than any dog that I have\never seen.  He was born at the Islands, his father being an English\nmastiff, and his mother a greyhound.  He had the high head, long legs,\nnarrow body, and springing gait of the latter, and the heavy jaw,\nthick jowls, and strong fore-quarters of the mastiff.  When he was\nbrought to San Diego, an English sailor said that he looked,\nabout the face, precisely like the Duke of Wellington, whom he had\nonce seen at the Tower; and, indeed, there was something about him\nwhich resembled the portraits of the Duke.  From this time he was\nchristened “Welly,” and became the favorite and bully of the beach.\nHe always led the dogs by several yards in the chase, and had killed\ntwo coati at different times in single combats.  We often had fine\nsport with these fellows.  A quick, sharp bark from a coati, and in\nan instant every dog was at the height of his speed.  A few moments\nmade up for an unfair start, and gave each dog his relative place.\nWelly, at the head, seemed almost to skim over the bushes; and after\nhim came Fanny, Feliciana, Childers, and the other fleet ones,–\nthe spaniels and terriers; and then behind, followed the heavy\ncorps–bulldogs, etc., for we had every breed.  Pursuit by us was\nin vain, and in about half an hour a few of them would come panting\nand straggling back.",
        "Beside the coati, the dogs sometimes made prizes of rabbits and\nhares, which are very plentiful here, and great numbers of which\nwe often shot for our dinners.  There was another animal that I\nwas not so much disposed to find amusement from, and that was the\nrattlesnake.  These are very abundant here, especially during the\nspring of the year.  The latter part of the time that I was on shore,\nI did not meet with so many, but for the first two months we seldom\nwent into “the bush” without one of our number starting some of them.\nThe first that I ever saw, I remember perfectly well.  I had left my\ncompanions, and was beginning to clear away a fine clump of trees,\nwhen just in the midst of the thicket, not more than eight yards from\nme, one of these fellows set up his hiss.  It is a sharp, continuous\nsound, and resembles very much the letting off of the steam from\nthe small pipe of a steamboat, except that it is on a smaller scale.\nI knew, by the sound of an axe, that one of my companions was near,\nand called out to him, to let him know what I had fallen upon.\nHe took it very lightly, and as he seemed inclined to laugh at me for\nbeing afraid, I determined to keep my place.  I knew that so long\nas I could hear the rattle, I was safe, for these snakes never make\na noise when they are in motion.  Accordingly, I kept at my work,\nand the noise which I made with cutting and breaking the trees kept\nhim in alarm; so that I had the rattle to show me his whereabouts.\nOnce or twice the noise stopped for a short time, which gave me a\nlittle uneasiness, and retreating a few steps, I threw something\ninto the bush, at which he would set his rattle agoing; and finding\nthat he had not moved from his first place, I was easy again.\nIn this way I continued at my work until I had cut a full load,\nnever suffering him to be quiet for a moment.  Having cut my load,\nI strapped it together, and got everything ready for starting. \nI felt that I could now call the others without the imputation of\nbeing afraid; and went in search of them.  In a few minutes we\nwere all collected, and began an attack upon the bush.  The big\nFrenchman, who was the one that I had called to at first, I found\nas little inclined to approach the snake as I had been.  The dogs,\ntoo, seemed afraid of the rattle, and kept up a barking at a safe\ndistance; but the Kanakas showed no fear, and getting long sticks,\nwent into the bush, and keeping a bright look-out, stood within a\nfew feet of him.  One or two blows struck near him, and a few stones\nthrown, started him, and we lost his track, and had the pleasant\nconsciousness that he might be directly under our feet.  By throwing\nstones and chips in different directions, we made him spring his\nrattle again, and began another attack.  This time we drove him\ninto the clear ground, and saw him gliding off, with head and tail\nerect, when a stone, well aimed, knocked him over the bank, down a\ndeclivity of fifteen or twenty feet, and stretched him at his length.\nHaving made sure of him, by a few more stones, we went down, and one\nof the Kanakas cut off his rattle.  These rattles vary in number it\nis said, according to the age of the snake; though the Indians think\nthey indicate the number of creatures they have killed.  We always\npreserved them as trophies, and at the end of the summer had quite\na number.  None of our people were ever bitten by them, but one of\nour dogs died of a bite, and another was supposed to have been bitten,\nbut recovered.  We had no remedy for the bite, though it was said that\nthe Indians of the country had, and the Kanakas professed to have an\nherb which would cure it, but it was fortunately never brought to the test.",
        "Hares and rabbits, as I said before, were abundant, and, during the\nwinter months, the waters are covered with wild ducks and geese.\nCrows, too, were very numerous, and frequently alighted in great\nnumbers upon our hides, picking at the pieces of dried meat and fat.\nBears and wolves are numerous in the upper parts, and in the interior,\n(and, indeed, a man was killed by a bear within a few miles of\nSan Pedro, while we were there,) but there were none in our\nimmediate neighborhood.  The only other animals were horses.\nOver a dozen of these were owned by different people on the beach,\nand were allowed to run loose among the hills, with a long lasso\nattached to them, and pick up feed wherever they could find it.\nWe were sure of seeing them once a day, for there was no water\namong the hills, and they were obliged to come down to the well\nwhich had been dug upon the beach.  These horses were bought at,\nfrom two, to six and eight dollars apiece, and were held very much\nas common property.  We generally kept one fast to one of the houses\nevery day, so that we could mount him and catch any of the others.\nSome of them were really fine animals, and gave us many good runs\nup to the Presidio and over the country.",
