        "Stern winter is the season in which to keep the eye peeled for the fragile\nlittle house plant. It is at that time that the coarse and brutal husband\ncarries the Scandinavian flower known as the Ole Ander, part way down the\ncellar, and allows it to fall the rest of the way. I carried a large Ole\nAndor up and down stairs for nine years, until the spring of 1880. That\nwas rather a backward spring, and a pale red cow, with one horn done up in\na French twist, ate the most of it as it stood on the porch.",
        "This cow was a total stranger to me. I had never done anything for her by\nwhich to win her esteem. It shows how Providence works through the\nhumblest means sometimes to accomplish a great good.",
        "I have tried many times to find the postoffice address of that lonely cow,\nso I might comfort her declining years, but she seemed to have melted away\ninto the bosom of space, for I cannot find her. Anyone knowing the\nwhereabouts of a pale red cow, with one horn done up in a French twist,\nand wearing a look of settled melancholy, will please communicate the same\nto me, as we have another Ole Ander that will just about fit her, I think,\nby spring.",
        "Bulbs may be wrapped in cotton and put in a cool place in the fall, and\nfed to the domestic animals in the spring. Geraniums should put on their\nbuffalo overcoats about the middle of November in our rigid northern\nclime, and in the spring they will have the same luxuriant foliage as the\ntropical hat-rack. Vines may be left in the room during the winter until\nthe furnace slips a cog and then you can pull them down and feed them to\nthe family horses. In changing your plants from the living rooms or\nelsewhere to the cellar in the fall, take great care to avoid injury to\nthe pot. I have experienced some very severe winters in my life, but I\nhave never seen the mercury so low that a flowerpot couldnâ€™t struggle\nthrough and look fresh and robust in the spring. The longevity of the pot\nis surprising when we consider how much death there is all about it. I had\na large brown flower-pot once that originally held the germ of a calla\nlily. This lily emerged from the soil with the light of immortality in its\neye. It got up to where we began to be attached to it, and then it died.\nThen we put a plant in its place which was given us by a friend. I do not\nremember now what this plant was called, but I know it was sent to us\nwrapped up in a piece of moist brown paper, and half an hour later a dray\ndrove up to the house with the name of the plant itself. In the summer it\nrequired very little care, and in the winter I would cover the little\nthing up with its name, and it would be safe till spring. One evening we\nhad a free-for-all musicale at my house, and a corpulent friend of mine\ntried to climb it, and it died. (Tried to climb the plant, not the\nmusicale.) The plant yielded to the severe climb it. This joke now makes\nits debut for the first time before the world. Anyone who feels offended\nwith this joke may wreak his vengeance on a friend of mine named Sullivan,\nwho is passionately fond of having people wreak their vengeance on him.\nPeople having a large amount of unwreaked vengeance on hand will do well\nto give him a call before purchasing elsewhere.",
