        "It has been estimated that there were four hundred poets in England in\nthe time of Shakespeare, and in the century during which Dante lived\nEurope fairly swarmed with poets, many of them of high excellence.\nFrederick II. of Germany and Richard I. of England were both good poets,\nand were as proud of their verses as they were of their military\nexploits. Frederick II. may be said to have founded the vernacular in\nwhich Dante wrote; and Longfellow rendered into English a poem of\nRichard’s which he composed during his cruel imprisonment in Austria. A\nknight who could not compose a song and sing it to the guitar was as rare\nas a modern gentleman of fashion who cannot play golf. When James Russell\nLowell resigned the chair of poetry at Harvard no one could be found who\ncould exactly fill his place, and it was much the same at Oxford after\nMatthew Arnold retired.",
        "The difference between then and now would seem to reside in the fact,\nthat poetry is more easily remembered than prose. From the time of Homer\nuntil long after the invention of printing, not only were ballad-singers\nand harpers in good demand, but the recital of poetry was also a favorite\nmeans of livelihood to indigent scholars and others, who wandered about\nlike the minstrels. The “article,” as Tom Moore called it, was in active\nrequest. Poetry was recited in the camp of Alexander, in the Roman baths,\nin the castles on the Rhine, and English hostelries. Now it is replaced\nby novel-reading, and there are few who know how much pleasure can be\nderived on a winter’s evening by impromptu poetic recitations. If a\npopular interest in poetry should revive again, I have no doubt that\nhundreds of poets would spring up, as it were, out of the ground and fill\nthe air with their pleasant harmonies. The editor of the Atlantic\ninformed Professor Child that he had a whole barrelful of poetry in his\nhouse, much of it excellent, but that there was no use he could make of\nit.",
        "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was as irrepressible a rhymer as John Watts\nhimself, and fortunately he had a father who recognized the value of his\ntalent and assisted him in a judicious manner, instead of placing\nobstacles in his way, as the father of Watts is supposed to have done.\nThe account that Rev. Samuel Longfellow has given us of the youth of his\nbrother is highly instructive, and ought to be of service to all young\nmen who fancy they are destined by nature for a poetic career. He tells\nus how Henry published his first poem in the Portland Gazette, and\nhow his boyish exultation was dashed with cold water the same evening by\nJudge ——, who said of it in his presence: “Stiff, remarkably stiff, and\nall the figures are borrowed.”",
        "The “Fight at Lovell’s Pond” would not have been a remarkable poem for a\nyouth of nineteen, but it showed very good promise for the age at which\nit was written. Few boys at that age can write anything that will hang\ntogether as a poem. Young Longfellow was a better poet at thirteen than\nhis father’s friend, the Judge, was a critic. His verses were by no means\nstiff, but on the contrary showed indications of that natural grace and\nfacility of expression for which he became afterwards distinguished. As\nfor the originality of his comparisons it is doubtful also if the Judge\ncould have proved his point on that question. They were original to\nHenry, if to nobody else.",
        "Fortunately for Henry he was also a fine scholar. The following year saw\nhim enter as a Freshman at Bowdoin College, which was equal to entering\nHarvard at the age of fifteen. Look out for the youngest members of a\ncollege class! They may not distinguish themselves at the university, but\nthey are the ones who, if they live, outstrip all others. But Longfellow\ndid distinguish himself. In his Junior year he composed seventeen poems\nwhich were published, then and afterwards, in the United States\nLiterary Gazette, where his name appeared beside that of William\nCullen Bryant. This was quite exceptional in the history of American\nliterature, and as the editor of the Literary Gazette stated it:\n“A young tree which puts forth so many blossoms is likely to bear good\nfruits.”",
        "With the close of his college course came the important question of\nLongfellow’s future occupation. His father, with good practical judgment,\nforesaw that poetry alone would not serve to make his son self-supporting\nand independent; but the boy hated to give this up for a more prosaic\nemployment. While the discussion was going on between them, the\nauthorities of Bowdoin solved the problem for them both by offering young\nLongfellow a professorship of modern languages on condition that he would\nspend two years in Europe preparing himself for the position. He had\ngraduated fourth in his class.",
        "Does not this prove the advantage of good scholarship? Was the rank list\ninverted in Longfellow’s case? I think not. He had lived a virtuous and\nindustrious life, not studying for rank or honor, but because he enjoyed\ndoing what was right and fit for a young man to do; and now the reward\nhad come to him, like the sun breaking through the clouds which seemed to\nobscure his future prospects. Still, there was a hard road before him. It\nis very pleasant to travel rapidly through foreign countries, seeing the\nbest that is in them and to return home with a multitude of fresh\nimpressions; but living and working a long time in another country seems\ntoo much like exile. The loneliness of the situation becomes a weary\nburden, and it is dangerous from its very loneliness. Many have died or\nlost their health under such conditions (in fact Longfellow came near\nlosing his life from Roman fever), and he wrote from Paris: “Here one can\nkeep evil at a distance as well as elsewhere, though, to be sure,\ntemptations are multiplied a thousand-fold if he is willing to enter into\nthem.” A young man’s first experience in London or Paris is a dangerous\nsense of freedom; for all the customary restraints of his daily life have\nbeen removed.",
        "Mrs. Stowe says of her beautiful character, “Eva St. Clair,” that all bad\ninfluences rolled off from her like dew from a cabbage leaf, and it was\nthe same with Longfellow throughout. He lived in France, Spain, Italy,\nand Germany, and then returned to Portland, the same true American as\nwhen he left there, without foreign ways or modes of thinking, and with\nno more than the slight aroma of a foreign air upon him. Longfellow and\nhis whole family were natural cosmopolitans. There was nothing of the\nproverbial Yankee in their composition.",
        "Whittier was a Quaker by creed, but he was also much of a Yankee in style\nand manner. Emerson looked like a Yankee, and possessed the cool Yankee\nshrewdness. Lowell’s “Biglow Papers” testified to the fundamental Yankee;\nbut the Longfellows were endowed with a peculiar refinement and purity\nwhich seemed to distinguish them as much in Cambridge or London as it did\nin Portland, where there has always been a rather superior sort of\nsociety. It was like French refinement without being Gallic. No wonder\nthat a famous poet should emanate from such a family.",
        "What we notice especially in the Longfellow Letters during this European\nsojourn is the admonition of Henry’s father, that German literature was\nmore important than Italian,—and the poet was always largely influenced\nby this afterwards; that Henry did not find Paris particularly\nattractive, and on the whole preferred the Spanish character to the\nFrench on account of its deeper under-currents; that he did not seem to\nrealize the danger that menaced him from Spanish brigands, in spite of\nthe black crosses by the roadside; and that he was not vividly impressed\nby the famous works of art in the Louvre gallery. He only notices that\none of Correggio’s figures resembles a young lady in Portland.",
        "Longfellow would seem to have been always the same in regard to his\nappreciation of art. When he was in Italy, in 1869, he visited all the\npicture galleries and evidently enjoyed doing so; but it was easy to see\nthat his brother, Rev. Samuel Longfellow, felt a much livelier interest\nin the subject than he did; and injured frescos or mutilated statues,\nlike the Torso of the Belvidere, were objects of aversion to him. Poets\nand musical composers see more with their ears than they do with their\neyes.",
        "The single work of art that attracted him strongly at this time was a\nstatue of Venus, by Canova, which he compares to the Venus de’ Medici,\nand his brother Samuel remarks that he was always more attracted by\nsculpture than painting. Canova was a genius very similar to Longfellow\nhimself, as nearly as an Italian could be made to match an American, and\nhe was then at the height of his reputation.",
        "In 1829 Longfellow returned to Portland and was immediately chosen a\nprofessor at Bowdoin College, where he remained for the next seven years.\nWhen, in 1836, Professor Ticknor retired from his position as instructor\nof modern languages at Harvard, his place was offered to Longfellow and\naccepted. This brought him into the literary centre of New England, and\none of the first acquaintances he made there was Charles Sumner, who was\nlecturing before the Harvard Law-School.",
        "The friendship between these two great men commenced at once and only\nceased at Sumner’s death in 1874, when Longfellow wrote one of the finest\nof his shorter poems in tribute to Sumner’s memory. It was as poetic a\nfriendship as that between Emerson and Carlyle; but whereas Emerson and\nCarlyle had differences of opinion, Sumner and Longfellow were always of\none mind. When Sumner made his Fanueil Hall speech against the fugitive\nslave law, which was simply fighting revolution with revolution, and\nHarvard College and the whole of Cambridge turned against him, Longfellow\nstood firm; and it may be suspected that he had many an unpleasant\ndiscussion with his aristocratic acquaintances on this point. It was\nconsidered bad enough to support Garrison, but supporting Sumner was a\ngreat deal worse, for Sumner was an orator who wielded a power only\ninferior to Webster. Fortunately for Longfellow, his connection with the\nuniversity ceased not long after Sumner’s election to the Senate; and the\nunpleasantness of his position may have been the leading cause of his\nretirement.",
        "Sumner was the best friend Longfellow had, and perhaps the best that he\ncould have had. There was Emerson, of course, and Longfellow was always\non friendly terms with him; but Emerson had a habit of catechising his\ncompanions which some of them did not altogether like; and this may have\nbeen the case with Longfellow, for they never became very intimate.\nSumner, on the contrary, had always a large stock of information to\ndispense, not only concerning American affairs but those of other\nnations, in which Longfellow never lost his interest. More important to\nhim even than this is the fact that Sumner’s statements were always to be\ntrusted. It may be surmised that it was not so much similarity of opinion\nas the purity of their motives that brought the poet and statesman\ntogether.",
        "As soon as Sumner returned from Washington, in spring or summer, he would\ngo out to call on Longfellow; and it was a pleasant sight to see them\nwalking together on a June evening beneath the overarching elms of\nhistoric Brattle Street. They were a pair of majestic-looking men; and\nthough Longfellow was nearly a head shorter than Sumner, his broad\nshoulders gave him an appearance of strength, as his capacious head and\nstrong, finely cut features evidently denoted an exceptional intellect.\nHe wore his hair poetically long, almost to his coat collar; and yet\nthere was not the slightest air of the Bohemian about him. They seemed to\nbe oblivious of everything except their conversation; and if this could\nhave been recorded it might prove to be as interesting as the poetry of\nthe one and the orations of the other. They were evidently talking on\ngreat subjects, and the earnestness on Sumner’s face was reflected on\nLongfellow’s as in a mirror.",
        "Hawthorne was a classmate of Longfellow, and in the biography of the\nlatter there are a number of letters from one to the other which are\nalways friendly,—but never more than that on Hawthorne’s side,—with one\nexception, where he thanks Longfellow for a complimentary review of\n“Twice-Told Tales” in the North American. At that time the\nNorth American was considered an authority which could make or\nunmake an author’s reputation; and Longfellow may be said to have opened\nthe door for Hawthorne into the great world. Hawthorne’s friendship for\nPresident Pierce proved an advantage to him financially, but it also\nbecame a barrier between him and the other literary men of his time. Of\ncourse he believed what his friend Pierce told him concerning public\naffairs, and when he found that his other friends had not the same faith\nin Pierce’s veracity he became more strongly a partisan of the pro-\nslavery cause on that account. Longfellow frankly admitted that he did\nnot understand Hawthorne, and he did not believe that anyone at Bowdoin\nCollege understood him. He was the most secretive man that he ever knew;\nbut so far as genius was concerned, he believed that Hawthorne would\noutlive every other writer of his time. He had the will of a great\nconqueror.",
        "Goethe has been called the pampered child of genius, of fortune, and the\nmuse; but if Goethe had greater celebrity he never enjoyed half the\nworldly prosperity of Longfellow. While Emerson was earning a hard\nlivelihood by lecturing in the West, and Whittier was dwelling in a\ncountry farm-house, Longfellow occupied one of the most desirable\nresidences in or about Boston, and had all the means at his command that\na modest man could wish for. The Craigie House was, and still remains,\nthe finest residence in Cambridge,—\"formerly the head-quarters of\nWashington, and afterwards of the Muses.” Good architecture never becomes\nantiquated, and the Craigie House is not only spacious within, but\ndignified without.",
        "One could best realize Longfellow’s opulence by walking through his\nlibrary adjacent to the eastern piazza, and gazing at the magnificent\neditions of foreign authors which had been presented to him by his\nfriends and admirers; especially the fine set of Chateaubriand’s works,\nin all respects worthy of a royal collection. There is no ornament in a\nhouse that testifies to the quality of the owner like a handsome library.",
        "Byron would seem to have been the only other poet that has enjoyed such\nprosperity, although Bryant, as editor of a popular newspaper, may have\napproached it closely; but a city house, with windows on only two sides,\nis not like a handsome suburban residence. Longfellow could look across\nthe Cambridge marshes and see the sunsets reflected in the water of the\nCharles River.",
        "Here he lived from 1843, when he married Miss Appleton, a daughter of one\nof the wealthiest merchant-bankers of Boston, until his death by\npneumonia in March, 1882. The situation seemed suited to him, and he\nalways remained a true poet and devoted to the muses:",
        "He did not believe in a luxurious life except so far as luxury added to\nrefinement, and everything in the way of fashionable show was very\ndistasteful to him. His brother Samuel once said, “I cannot imagine\nanything more disagreeable than to ride in a public procession;” and the\ntwo men were more alike than brothers often are. We notice in the poet’s\ndiary that he abstains from going to a certain dinner in Boston for fear\nof being called upon to make a speech. Craigie House gave Longfellow the\nopportunity in which he most delighted,—of entertaining his friends and\ndistinguished foreign guests in a handsome manner; but conventional\ndinner parties, with their fourteen plates half surrounded by wine-\nglasses, were not often seen there. He much preferred a smaller number of\nguests with the larger freedom of discourse which accompanies a select\ngathering. Many such occasions are referred to in his diary,—as if he\ndid not wish to forget them.",
        "He was the finest host and story-teller in the country. His genial\ncourtesy was simply another expression of that mental grace which made\nhis reputation as a poet, and his manner of reciting an incident,\notherwise trivial, would give it the same additional quality as in his\nverses on Springfield Arsenal and the crooked Songo River, which without\nLongfellow would be little or nothing. Then his fund of information was\nwhat might be expected from a man who had lived in all the countries of\nwestern Europe.",
        "He had humble and unfortunate friends whom he seemed to think as much of\nas though they were distinguished. He recognized fine traits of\ncharacter, perhaps real greatness of character, in out-of-the-way\nplaces,—men whose chief happiness was their acquaintance with\nLongfellow. It was something much better than charity; and Professor\nChild spoke of it on the day of Emerson’s funeral as the finest flower in\nthe poet’s wreath.",
        "Longfellow was one of the kindest friends that the Hungarian exiles found\nwhen they came to Boston in 1852. Longfellow helped Kossuth, subscribed\nto Kalapka’s riding-school, and entertained a number of them at his\nhouse. Afterwards, when one of the exiles set up a business in Hungarian\nwines, Longfellow made a large purchase of him, which he spoke of twenty\nyears later with much satisfaction. He liked Tokay, and also the white\nwine of Capri, which he regretted could not be obtained in America.",
        "Those who supposed that Longfellow was easily imposed upon made a great\nmistake. He had the reputation among his publishers of understanding\nbusiness affairs better than any author in New England; but he was almost\ntoo kind-hearted. Somewhere about 1859 a photographer made an excellent\npicture of his daughters—indeed, it was a charming group—and the man\nbegged Mr. Longfellow for permission to sell copies of it as it would be\nof great advantage to him. Longfellow complied and the consequence was\nthat in 1860 one could hardly open a photograph album anywhere without\nfinding Longfellow’s daughters in it. Then a vulgar story originated that\nthe youngest daughter had only one arm, because her left arm was hidden\nbehind her sister. It is to be hoped that Longfellow never heard of this,\nfor if he did it must have caused him a good deal of pain, in return for\nhis kindness; but that is what one gets. Fortunately the photographs have\nlong since faded out.",
        "Much in the same line was his interest in the children of the poor. A\nragged urchin seemed to attract him much more than one that was nicely\ndressed. Perhaps they seemed more poetic to him, and he could see more\ndeeply into the joys and sorrows of their lives.",
        "Where the Episcopal Theological School now stands on Brattle Street there\nwas formerly a sort of tenement-house; and one day, as we were taking a\nstroll before dinner, we noticed three small boys with dirty faces\nstanding at the corner of the building; and just then one of them cried\nout: “Oh, see; here he comes!” And immediately Longfellow appeared\nleaving the gate of Craigie House. We passed him before he reached the\nchildren, but on looking back we saw that he had stopped to speak with\nthem. They evidently knew him very well.",
        "It is remarkable how the impression should have been circulated that\nLongfellow was not much of a pedestrian. On the contrary, there was no\none who was seen more frequently on the streets of Cambridge. He walked\nwith a springy step and a very slight swing of the shoulders, which\nshowed that he enjoyed it. He may not have walked such long distances as\nHawthorne, or so rapidly as Dickens, but he was a good walker.",
        "His sister, Mrs. Greenleaf, built a memorial chapel in North Cambridge\nfor the Episcopal society there, and from this Longfellow formed the\nhabit of walking in that direction by way of the Botanic Garden.\nSomewhere in the cross streets he became acquainted with two children,\nthe son and daughter of a small shop-keeper. They, of course, told their\nmother about their white-haired acquaintance, and with the fate of\nCharlie Ross before her eyes, their mother warned them to keep out of his\nway. He might be a tramp, and tramps were dangerous!",
        "However, it was not long before the children met their white-haired\nfriend again, and the boy asked him: “Are you a tramp? Mother thinks\nyou’re a tramp, and she wants to know what your name is.” It may be\npresumed that Mr. Longfellow laughed heartily at this misconception, but\nhe said: “I think I may call myself a tramp. I tramp a good deal; but you\nmay tell your mother that my name is Henry W. Longfellow.” He afterwards\ncalled on the mother in order to explain himself, and to congratulate her\non having such fine children.",
        "When the Saturday Club, popularly known as the Atlantic Club, was\norganized, one of the first subjects of discussion that came up was the\nquestion of autographs. Emerson said that was the way in which he\nobtained his postage stamps; but Longfellow confessed that he had given\naway a large number of them. And so it continued to the end. “Why should\nI not do it,” he would say, “if it gives them pleasure?” Emerson looked\non such matters from the stoical point of view as an encouragement to\nvanity; but he would have been more politic to have gratified his\ncurious, or sentimental admirers; for every autograph he gave would have\nmade a purchaser for his publishers.",
        "Harmony did not always prevail in the Saturday Club, for politics was the\nall-embracing subject in those days and its members represented every\nshade of political opinion. Emerson, Longfellow, and Lowell were strongly\nanti-slavery, but they differed in regard to methods. Lowell was what was\nthen called a Seward man, and differed with Emerson in regard to John\nBrown, and with Longfellow in regard to Sumner. Holmes was still more\nconservative; and Agassiz was a McClellan Democrat. William Hunt, the\npainter, believed that the war was caused by the ambition of the leading\npoliticians in the North and South. Longfellow had the advantage of more\ndirect information than the others, and enjoyed the continued successes\nof the Republican party.",
        "In the spring of 1866 a number of Southerners came to Boston to borrow\nfunds in order to rehabilitate their plantations, and were introduced at\nthe Union League Club. Finding themselves there in a congenial element\nthey made speeches strongly tinged with secession doctrines. Sumner, of\ncourse, could not let this pass without making some protest against it,\nand for this he was hissed. The incident was everywhere talked of, and\ncame under discussion at the next meeting of the Saturday Club. Otto\nDresel, a German pianist, who had small reason for being there, said, “It\nwas not Mr. Sumner’s politics but his bad manners that were hissed.\"\nLongfellow set his glass down with emphasis, and replied: “If good\nmanners could not say it, thank heaven bad manners did;” and Lowell\nsupported this with some pretty severe criticism of the Union League\nClub. In justice to the Union League Club, however, it ought to be said\nthat there was applause as well as hisses for Sumner.",
        "Longfellow had a leonine face, but it was that of a very mild lion; one\nthat had never learned the use of teeth and claws. Yet those who knew him\nfelt that he could roar on occasion, if occasion required it. Once at\nLongfellow’s own table the conversation chanced upon Goethe, and a\ngentleman present remarked that Goethe was in the habit of drinking three\nbottles of hock a day. “Who said he did?” inquired the poet. “It is in\nLewes’s biography,” said the gentleman. “I do not believe it,” replied\nLongfellow, “unless,” he added with a laugh, “they were very small\nbottles.” A few days afterwards Prof. William James remarked in regard to\nthis incident that the story was quite incredible.",
        "In his youth Longfellow seems to have taken to guns and fishing-rods more\nregularly than some boys do, but pity for his small victims soon induced\nhim to relinquish the sport. His eldest son, Charles, also took to guns\nvery naturally, and in spite of a severe wound which he received from the\nexplosion of a badly loaded piece, he finally became one of the most\nexpert pigeon-shooters in the State. At the intercession of his father,\nwho considered the game too cruel, he afterwards relinquished this for\ntarget-shooting, in which he succeeded equally well. I was talking one\nday with him on this subject and remarked that I had recently shot two\ncrows with my rifle. “What did you do it for?” interposed his father, in\na deprecatory tone. So I explained to him that crows were outside of the\npale of the law; that they not only were a pest to the farmers but\ndestroyed the eggs and young of singing birds,—in fact, they were bold,\nblack robbers, whose livery betokened their evil deeds. This evidently\ninterested him, and he finally said with a laugh: “If that is the case,\nwe will give you and Charlie a commission to exterminate them.”",
        "There was a story that when young Nicholas Longworth came to Harvard\nCollege in the autumn of 1862 and called on Mr. Longfellow, who had been\nentertained at his father’s house in Cincinnati, the poet said to him:\n“It is worth that makes the man; the want of it the fellow“\n—a compliment that almost dumfounded his young acquaintance. It is\ncertain that Longfellow addressed a poem to Mrs. Longworth which will be\nfound in the collection of his minor poems, and in which he speaks of her\nas—",
        "In the midst of this unrivalled prosperity, this distinction of genius,\nand public and private honor, on the ninth of July, 1861, there came one\nof the most harrowing tragedies that has ever befallen a man’s domestic\nlife. Longfellow was widowed for the second time, and five children were\nleft without a mother. It seemed as if Providence had set a limit beyond\nwhich human happiness could not pass. It was after this calamity that\nLongfellow undertook his metrical translation of Dante’s “Divina\nCommedia,” a much more difficult and laborious work than writing original\npoetry. As his brother said, “He required an absorbing occupation to\nprevent him from thinking of the past.”",
        "No wonder that in later years he said, in his exquisite verses on the\nMountain of the Holy Cross in Colorado, these pathetic words, “On my\nheart also there is a cross of snow.” In Longfellow’s diary we meet with\nthe names of many books that he read, and these as well as the pertinent\ncomments on them tell much more of his intellectual life than we derive\nfrom his letters. “Adam Bede,” which took the world by storm, did not\nmake so much of an impression on him as Hawthorne’s “Marble Faun,” which\nhe read through in a day and calls a wonderful book. Of “Adam Bede” he\nsays: “It is too feminine for a man; too masculine for a woman.” He says\nof Dickens, after reading “Barnaby Rudge”: “He is always prodigal and\nample, but what a set of vagabonds he contrives to introduce us to!\"\n“Barnaby Rudge” is certainly the most bohemian and esoteric of Dickens’s\nnovels. He liked much better Miss Muloch’s “John Halifax,\"—a popular\nbook in its time, but not read very much since. He calls Charles Reade a\nclever and amusing writer. We find nothing concerning Disraeli, Trollope,\nor Wilkie Collins. Neither do we hear of critical and historical writers\nlike Ruskin, Matthew Arnold, Carlyle, and Froude. He went, however, to\ncall on Carlyle in England, and was greatly impressed by his\nconversation. The scope of Longfellow’s reading does not compare with\nthat of Emerson or Marian Evans; but the doctors say that “every man of\nforty knows the food that is good for him,” and this is true mentally as\nwell as physically.",
        "He refers more frequently to Tennyson than to any other writer, and\nalways in a generous, cordial manner. Of the “Idyls of the King” he says\nthat the first and third Idyls could only have come from a great poet,\nbut that the second and fourth are not quite equal to the others.",
        "Once, at his sister’s house, he held out a book in his hand and said:\n“Here is some of the finest dramatic poetry that I have ever read.” It\nwas Tennyson’s “Queen Mary;” but there were many who would not have\nagreed with his estimate of it. Rev. Samuel Longfellow considered the\nstatement very doubtful.",
        "In the summer of 1868 Longfellow went to Europe with his family to see\nwhat Henry James calls “the best of it.” Rev. Samuel Longfellow and T. G.\nAppleton accompanied the party, which, with the addition of Ernest\nLongfellow’s beautiful bride, made a strong impression wherever they were\nseen. In fact their tour was like a triumphal procession.",
        "Longfellow was everywhere treated with the distinction of a famous poet;\nand his fine appearance and dignified bearing increased the reputation\nwhich had already preceded him. His meeting with Tennyson was considered\nas important as the visit of the King of Prussia to Napoleon III., and\nmuch less dangerous to the peace of Europe. It was talked of from\nEdinburgh to Rome.",
        "Longfellow, however, hated lionizing in all its forms, and he avoided\nceremonious receptions as much as possible. He enjoyed the entertainment\nof meeting distinguished people, but he evidently preferred to meet them\nin an unconventional manner, and to have them as much to himself as\npossible. Princes and savants called on him, but he declined every\ninvitation that might tend to give him publicity.",
        "His facility in the different languages was much marvelled at. While he\nwas in Florence a delegation from the mountain towns of Tuscany waited\nupon him and he conversed with them in their own dialect, greatly to\ntheir surprise and satisfaction.",
        "From a number of incidents in this journey, related by Rev. Samuel\nLongfellow, the following has a permanent interest:",
        "When the party came to Verona in May, 1869, they found Ruskin elevated on\na ladder, from which he was examining the sculpture on a monument. As\nsoon as he heard that the Longfellow party was below, he came down and\ngreeted them very cordially. He was glad that they had stopped at Verona,\nwhich was so interesting and so often overlooked; he wanted them to\nobserve the sculptures on the monument,—the softly-flowing draperies\nwhich seemed more as if they had been moulded with hands than cut with a\nchisel. He then spoke in grievous terms of the recent devastation by the\nfloods in Switzerland, which had also caused much damage in the plains of\nLombardy. He thought that reservoirs ought to be constructed on the sides\nof the mountains, which would stay the force of the torrents, and hold\nthe water until it could be made useful. He wished that the Alpine Club\nwould take an interest in the matter. After enjoying so much in\nSwitzerland it would be only fair for them to do something for the\nbenefit of the country. Mr. Appleton then said: “That is a work for\ngovernment to do;” to which Ruskin replied: “Governments do nothing but\nfill their pockets, and issue this,\"—taking out a handful of Italian\npaper currency, which was then much below par.",
        "Everyone has his or her favorite poet or poets, and it is a common\npractice with young critics to disparage one in order to elevate another.\nLongfellow was the most popular American poet of his time, but there were\nothers besides Edgar A. Poe who pretended to disdain him. I have met more\nsuch critics in Cambridge than in England, Germany, or Italy; and the\nreason was chiefly a political one. At a distance Longfellow’s politics\nattracted little attention, but in Cambridge they could not help being\nfelt. In 1862 a strong movement emanated from the Harvard Law-School to\ndefeat Sumner and Andrew, and the lines became drawn pretty sharply. As\nit happened, the prominent conservatives with one or two exceptions all\nlived to the east and north of the college grounds, while Longfellow,\nLowell, Doctor Francis (who baptized Longfellow’s children), Prof. Asa\nGray, and other liberals lived at the west end; and the local division\nmade the contest more acrimonious. The conservatives afterwards felt the\nbitterness of defeat, and it was many years before they recovered from\nthis. A resident graduate of Harvard, who was accustomed to converse on\nsuch subjects as the metaphysics of Hamilton’s quaternions, once said\nthat Longfellow was the paragon of schoolgirls, because he wrote what\nthey would like to so much better than they could. This was contemptible\nenough; but how can one expect a man who discourses on the metaphysics of\nHamilton’s quaternions to appreciate Longfellow’s art, or any art pure\nand simple. “Evangeline,” which is perhaps the finest of Longfellow’s\npoems, is not a favorite with youthful readers.",
        "He was greater as a man, perhaps, than as a poet. Future ages will have\nto determine this; but he was certainly one of the best poets of his\ntime. Professor Hedge, one of our foremost literary critics, spoke of him\nas the one American poet whose verses sing themselves; and with the\nexception of Bryant’s “Robert of Lincoln,” and Poe’s “Raven,” and a few\nother pieces, this may be taken as a judicious statement.",
        "Longfellow’s unconsciousness is charming, even when it seems childlike.\nAs a master of verse he has no English rival since Spenser. The trochaic\nmeter in which “Hiawatha” is written would seem to have been his own\ninvention; [Footnote: At least I can remember no other long poem composed\nin it.] and is a very agreeable change from the perpetual iambics of\nByron and Wordsworth. “Evangeline” is perhaps the most successful\ninstance of Greek and Latin hexameter being grafted on to an English\nstem. Matthew Arnold considered it too dactylic, but the lightness of its\nmovement personifies the grace of the heroine herself. Lines like\nVirgil’s",
        "would not have been suited to the subject.",
        "It has often been said that “Hiawatha” does not represent the red man as\nhe really is, and this is true. Neither does Tennyson represent the\nknights of King Arthur’s court as they were in the sixth century A.D.\nThey are more like modern English gentlemen, and when we read the German\nNeibelungen we recognize this difference. Virgil’s Aeneid does not belong\nto the period of the Trojan war, but this does not prevent the Aeneid\nfrom being very fine poetry. The American Indian is not without his\npoetic side, as is proved by the squaw who knelt down on a flowery\nBrussels carpet, and smoothing it with her hands, said: “Hahnsome!\nhahnsome! heaven no hahnsomer!” There is true poetry in this; and so\nthere is in the Indian cradle-song:",
        "Either of these incidents is sufficient to testify to Longfellow’s\n“Hiawatha.”",
        "The best poetry is that which forces itself upon our memories, so that it\nbecomes part of our life without the least effort of recollection. Such\nare Emerson’s “Problem,” Whittier’s “Barbara Frietchie,” and Longfellow’s\n“Santa Filomena.”",
        "Those are fortunate in this life who feel the glad surprise of\nLongfellow.",
        "“Hiawatha” is equally universal in its application to modern life. The\nquestions of the Indian boy and the replies of his nurse, the good\nNikomis, are not confined to the life of the aborigines. Every spirited\nboy is a Hiawatha, and in one form or another goes through the same\nexperiences that Longfellow has represented with such consummate art in\nhis American epic-idyl.",
