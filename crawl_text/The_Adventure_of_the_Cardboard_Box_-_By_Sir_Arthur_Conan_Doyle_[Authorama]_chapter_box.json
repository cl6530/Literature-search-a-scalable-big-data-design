        "In choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable\nmental qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have\nendeavoured, as far as possible, to select those which presented\nthe minimum of sensationalism, while offering a fair field for\nhis talents.  It is, however, unfortunately impossible entirely\nto separate the sensational from the criminal, and a chronicler\nis left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details\nwhich are essential to his statement and so give a false\nimpression of the problem, or he must use matter which chance,\nand not choice, has provided him with.  With this short preface I\nshall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange, though a\npeculiarly terrible, chain of events.",
        "It was a blazing hot day in August.  Baker Street was like an\noven, and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of\nthe house across the road was painful to the eye.  It was hard to\nbelieve that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily\nthrough the fogs of winter.  Our blinds were half-drawn, and\nHolmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter\nwhich he had received by the morning post.  For myself, my term\nof service in India had trained me to stand heat better than\ncold, and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship.  But the\nmorning paper was uninteresting.  Parliament had risen.\nEverybody was out of town, and I yearned for the glades of the\nNew Forest or the shingle of Southsea.  A depleted bank account\nhad caused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion,\nneither the country nor the sea presented the slightest\nattraction to him.  He loved to lie in the very center of five\nmillions of people, with his filaments stretching out and running\nthrough them, responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of\nunsolved crime.  Appreciation of nature found no place among his\nmany gifts, and his only change was when he turned his mind from\nthe evil-doer of the town to track down his brother of the\ncountry.",
        "Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had\ntossed side the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I fell\ninto a brown study.  Suddenly my companion’s voice broke in upon\nmy thoughts:",
        "“You are right, Watson,” said he.  “It does seem a most\npreposterous way of settling a dispute.”",
        "“Most preposterous!” I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how\nhe had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair\nand stared at him in blank amazement.",
        "“What is this, Holmes?” I cried.  “This is beyond anything which\nI could have imagined.”",
        "He laughed heartily at my perplexity.",
        "“You remember,” said he, “that some little time ago when I read\nyou the passage in one of Poe’s sketches in which a close\nreasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were\ninclined to treat the matter as a mere tour-de-force of the\nauthor.  On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of\ndoing the same thing you expressed incredulity.”",
        "“Oh, no!”",
        "“Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with\nyour eyebrows.  So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter\nupon a train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity\nof reading it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof\nthat I had been in rapport with you.”",
        "But I was still far from satisfied.  “In the example which you\nread to me,” said I, “the reasoner drew his conclusions from the\nactions of the man whom he observed. If I remember right, he\nstumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so\non.  But I have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clues\ncan I have given you?”",
        "“You do yourself an injustice.  The features are given to man as\nthe means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are\nfaithful servants.”",
        "“Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my\nfeatures?”",
        "“Your features and especially your eyes.  Perhaps you cannot\nyourself recall how your reverie commenced?”",
        "“No, I cannot.”",
        "“Then I will tell you.  After throwing down your paper, which was\nthe action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a\nminute with a vacant expression.  Then your eyes fixed themselves\nupon your newly framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by\nthe alteration in your face that a train of thought had been\nstarted.  But it did not lead very far.  Your eyes flashed across\nto the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon\nthe top of your books.  Then you glanced up at the wall, and of\ncourse your meaning was obvious.  You were thinking that if the\nportrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and\ncorrespond with Gordon’s picture there.”",
        "“You have followed me wonderfully!” I exclaimed.",
        "“So far I could hardly have gone astray.  But now your thoughts\nwent back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were\nstudying the character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to\npucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was\nthoughtful.  You were recalling the incidents of Beecher’s\ncareer.  I was well aware that you could not do this without\nthinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North\nat the time of the Civil War, for I remember your expressing your\npassionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the\nmore turbulent of our people.  You felt so strongly about it that\nI knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that\nalso.  When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the\npicture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil\nWar, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled,\nand your hands clenched I was positive that you were indeed\nthinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that\ndesperate struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder, you\nshook your head.  You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror\nand useless waste of life.  Your hand stole towards your own old\nwound and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the\nridiculous side of this method of settling international\nquestions had forced itself upon your mind. At this point I\nagreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to find\nthat all my deductions had been correct.”",
        "“Absolutely!” said I.  “And now that you have explained it, I\nconfess that I am as amazed as before.”",
        "“It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you.  I should\nnot have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some\nincredulity the other day.  But I have in my hands here a little\nproblem which may prove to be more difficult of solution than my\nsmall essay I thought reading.  Have you observed in the paper a\nshort paragraph referring to the remarkable contents of a packet\nsent through the post to Miss Cushing, of Cross Street, Croydon?”",
        "“No, I saw nothing.”",
        "“Ah! then you must have overlooked it.  Just toss it over to me.\nHere it is, under the financial column.  Perhaps you would be\ngood enough to read it aloud.”",
        "I picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the\nparagraph indicated. It was headed, “A Gruesome Packet.”",
        "“Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been\nmade the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly\nrevolting practical joke unless some more sinister meaning should\nprove to be attached to the incident.  At two o’clock yesterday\nafternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in\nby the postman.  A cardboard box was inside, which was filled\nwith coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss Cushing was horrified to\nfind two human ears, apparently quite freshly severed.  The box\nhad been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the morning\nbefore.  There is no indication as to the sender, and the matter\nis the more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of\nfifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances\nor correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive\nanything through the post.  Some years ago, however, when she\nresided at Penge, she let apartments in her house to three young\nmedical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account\nof their noisy and irregular habits.  The police are of opinion\nthat this outrage may have been perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by\nthese youths, who owed her a grudge and who hoped to frighten her\nby sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms.  Some\nprobability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these\nstudents came from the north of Ireland, and, to the best of Miss\nCushing’s belief, from Belfast.  In the meantime, the matter is\nbeing actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very\nsmartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.”",
        "“So much for the Daily Chronicle,” said Holmes as I finished\nreading.  “Now for our friend Lestrade.  I had a note from him\nthis morning, in which he says:",
        "“I think that this case is very much in your line.  We have every\nhope of clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty\nin getting anything to work upon.  We have, of course, wired to\nthe Belfast post-office, but a large number of parcels were\nhanded in upon that day, and they have no means of identifying\nthis particular one, or of remembering the sender.  The box is a\nhalf-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does not help us in any\nway.  The medical student theory still appears to me to be the\nmost feasible, but if you should have a few hours to spare I\nshould be very happy to see you out here.  I shall be either at\nthe house or in the police-station all day.",
        "“What say you, Watson?  Can you rise superior to the heat and run\ndown to Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your\nannals?”",
        "“I was longing for something to do.”",
        "“You shall have it then.  Ring for our boots and tell them to\norder a cab.  I’ll be back in a moment when I have changed my\ndressing-gown and filled my cigar-case.”",
        "A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat\nwas far less oppressive in Croydon than in town.  Holmes had sent\non a wire, so that Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-\nlike as ever, was waiting for us at the station.  A walk of five\nminutes took us to Cross Street, where Miss Cushing resided.",
        "It was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and\nprim, with whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned\nwomen gossiping at the doors.  Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and\ntapped at a door, which was opened by a small servant girl.  Miss\nCushing was sitting in the front room, into which we were\nushered.  She was a placid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes,\nand grizzled hair curving down over her temples on each side.  A\nworked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a basket of coloured\nsilks stood upon a stool beside her.",
        "“They are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,” said she as\nLestrade entered.  “I wish that you would take them away\naltogether.”",
        "“So I shall, Miss Cushing.  I only kept them here until my\nfriend, Mr. Holmes, should have seen them in your presence.”",
        "“Why in my presence, sir?”",
        "“In case he wished to ask any questions.”",
        "“What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know\nnothing whatever about it?”",
        "“Quite so, madam,” said Holmes in his soothing way.  “I have no\ndoubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over\nthis business.”",
        "“Indeed I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and live a retired life.\nIt is something new for me to see my name in the papers and to\nfind the police in my house.  I won’t have those things I here,\nMr. Lestrade.  If you wish to see them you must go to the\nouthouse.”",
        "It was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the\nhouse.  Lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box,\nwith a piece of brown paper and some string.  There was a bench\nat the end of the path, and we all sat down while Homes examined\none by one, the articles which Lestrade had handed to him.",
        "“The string is exceedingly interesting,” he remarked, holding it\nup to the light and sniffing at it.  “What do you make of this\nstring, Lestrade?”",
        "“It has been tarred.”",
        "“Precisely.  It is a piece of tarred twine.  You have also, no\ndoubt, remarked that Miss Cushing has cut the cord with a\nscissors, as can be seen by the double fray on each side.  This\nis of importance.”",
        "“I cannot see the importance,” said Lestrade.",
        "“The importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact,\nand that this knot is of a peculiar character.”",
        "“It is very neatly tied.  I had already made a note of that\neffect,” said Lestrade complacently.",
        "“So much for the string, then,” said Holmes, smiling, “now for\nthe box wrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee.\nWhat, did you not observe it?  I think there can be no doubt of\nit.  Address printed in rather straggling characters:  ’Miss S.\nCushing, Cross Street, Croydon.’  Done with a broad-pointed pen,\nprobably a J, and with very inferior ink.  The word ’Croydon’ has\nbeen originally spelled with an ’i’, which has been changed to\n’y’.  The parcel was directed, then, by a man—the printing is\ndistinctly masculine—of limited education and unacquainted with\nthe town of Croydon.  So far, so good!  The box is a yellow,\nhalf-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two thumb\nmarks at the left bottom corner.  It is filled with rough salt of\nthe quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser\ncommercial purposes.  And embedded in it are these very singular\nenclosures.”",
        "He took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across\nhis knee he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending\nforward on each side of him, glanced alternately at these\ndreadful relics and at the thoughtful, eager face of our\ncompanion.  Finally he returned them to the box once more and sat\nfor a while in deep meditation.",
        "“You have observed, of course,” said he at last, “that the ears\nare not a pair.”",
        "“Yes, I have noticed that.  But if this were the practical joke\nof some students from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy\nfor them to send two odd ears as a pair.”",
        "“Precisely.  But this is not a practical joke.”",
        "“You are sure of it?”",
        "“The presumption is strongly against it.  Bodies in the\ndissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid.  These\nears bear no signs of this.  They are fresh, too.  They have been\ncut off with a blunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a\nstudent had done it.  Again, carbolic or rectified spirits would\nbe the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the\nmedical mind, certainly not rough salt.  I repeat that there is\nno practical joke here, but that we are investigating a serious\ncrime.”",
        "A vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion’s\nwords and saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features.\nThis brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and\ninexplicable horror in the background. Lestrade, however, shook\nhis head like a man who is only half convinced.",
        "“There are objections to the joke theory, no doubt,” said he,\n\"but there are much stronger reasons against the other.  We know\nthat this woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at\nPenge and here for the last twenty years.  She has hardly been\naway from her home for a day during that time.  Why on earth,\nthen, should any criminal send her the proofs of his guilt,\nespecially as, unless she is a most consummate actress, she\nunderstands quite as little of the matter as we do?”",
        "“That is the problem which we have to solve,” Holmes answered,\n\"and for my part I shall set about it by presuming that my\nreasoning is correct, and that a double murder has been\ncommitted.  One of these ears is a woman’s, small, finely formed,\nand pierced for an earring.  The other is a man’s, sun-burned,\ndiscoloured, and also pierced for an earring.  These two people\nare presumably dead, or we should have heard their story before\nnow.  To-day is Friday.  The packet was posted on Thursday\nmorning.  The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday, or\nearlier.  If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer\nwould have sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing?  We may\ntake it that the sender of the packet is the man whom we want.\nBut he must have some strong reason for sending Miss Cushing this\npacket.  What reason then?  It must have been to tell her that\nthe deed was done! or to pain her, perhaps.  But in that case she\nknows who it is.  Does she know?  I doubt it.  If she knew, why\nshould she cal the police in?  She might have buried the ears,\nand no one would have been the wiser. That is what she would have\ndone if she had wished to shield the criminal.  But if she does\nnot wish to shield him she would give his name.  There is a\ntangle here which needs straightening to.”  He had been talking\nin a high, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence,\nbut now he sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the\nhouse.",
        "“I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,” said he.",
        "“In that case I may leave you here,” said Lestrade, “for I have\nanother small business on hand.  I think that I have nothing\nfurther to learn form Miss Cushing.  You will find me at the\npolice-station.”",
        "“We shall look in on our way to the train,” answered Holmes.  A\nmoment later he and I were back in the front room, where the\nimpassive lady was still quietly working away at her\nantimacassar.  She put it down on her lap as we entered and\nlooked at us with her frank, searching blue eyes.",
        "“I am convinced, sir,” she said, “that this matter is a mistake,\nand that the parcel was never meant for me at all.  I have said\nthis several times to the gentlemen from Scotland Yard, but he\nsimply laughs at me.  I have not an enemy in the world, as far as\nI know, so why should anyone play me such a trick?”",
        "“I am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing,” said\nHolmes, taking a seat beside her.  “I think that it is more than\nprobable—” He paused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to\nsee that he was staring with singular intentness at the lady’s\nprofile.  Surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to\nbe read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to\nfind out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as\never.  I stared hard myself at her flat, grizzled hair, her trim\ncap, her little gilt earrings, her placid features; but I could\nsee nothing which could account for my companion’s evident\nexcitement.",
        "“There were one or two questions—”",
        "“Oh, I am weary of questions!” cried Miss Cushing impatiently.",
        "“You have two sisters, I believe.”",
        "“How could you know that?”",
        "“I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you\nhave a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece, one\nof whom is undoubtedly yourself, while the others are so\nexceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the\nrelationship.”",
        "“Yes, you are quite right.  Those are my sisters, Sarah and\nMary.”",
        "“And here at my elbow is another portrait, taken at Liverpool, of\nyour younger sister, in the company of a man who appears to be a\nsteward by his uniform.  I observe that she was unmarried at the\ntime.”",
        "“You are very quick at observing.”",
        "“That is my trade.”",
        "“Well, you are quite right.  But she was married to Mr. Browner a\nfew days afterwards.  He was on the South American line when that\nwas taken, but he was so fond of her that he couldn’t abide to\nleave her for so long, and he got into the Liverpool and London\nboats.”",
        "“Ah, the Conqueror, perhaps?”",
        "“No, the May Day, when last I heard.  Jim came down here to see\nme once.  That was before he broke the pledge; but afterwards he\nwould always take drink when he was ashore, and a little drink\nwould send him stark, staring mad.  Ah! it was a bad day that\never he took a glass in his hand again.  First he dropped me,\nthen he quarrelled with Sarah, and now that Mary has stopped\nwriting we don’t know how things are going with them.”",
        "It was evident that Miss Cushing had come upon a subject on which\nshe felt very deeply.  Like most people who lead a lonely life,\nshe was shy at first, but ended by becoming extremely\ncommunicative.  She told us many details about her brother-in-law\nthe steward, and then wandering off on the subject of her former\nlodgers, the medical students, she gave us a long account of\ntheir delinquencies, with their names and those of their\nhospitals.  Holmes listened attentively to everything, throwing\nin a question from time to time.",
        "“About your second sister, Sarah,” said he.  “I wonder, since you\nare both maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.”",
        "“Ah! you don’t know Sarah’s temper or you would wonder no more.\nI tried it when I came to Croydon, and we kept on until about two\nmonths ago, when we had to part.  I don’t want to say a word\nagainst my own sister, but she was always meddlesome and hard to\nplease, was Sarah.”",
        "“You say that she quarrelled with your Liverpool relations.”",
        "“Yes, and they were the best of friends at one time.  Why, she\nwent up there to live in order to be near them.  And now she has\nno word hard enough for Jim Browner.  The last six months that\nshe was here she would speak of nothing but his drinking and his\nways.  He had caught her meddling, I suspect, and given her a bit\nof his mind, and that was the start of it.”",
        "“Thank you, Miss Cushing,” said Holmes, rising and bowing.  “Your\nsister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street, Wallington?\nGood-bye, and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled\nover a case with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to\ndo.”",
        "There was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it.",
        "“How far to Wallington?” he asked.",
        "“Only about a mile, sir.”",
        "“Very good.  Jump in, Watson.  We must strike while the iron is\nhot.  Simple as the case is, there have been one or two very\ninstructive details in connection with it.  Just pull up at a\ntelegraph office as you pass, cabby.”",
        "Holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay\nback in the cab, with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the\nsun from his face. Our drive pulled up at a house which was not\nunlike the one which we had just quitted.  My companion ordered\nhim to wait, and had his hand upon the knocker, when the door\nopened and a grave young gentleman in black, with a very shiny\nhat, appeared on the step.",
        "“Is Miss Cushing at home?” asked Holmes.",
        "“Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,” said he.  “She has been\nsuffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity.\nAs her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility\nof allowing anyone to see her.  I should recommend you to call\nagain in ten days.”  He drew on his gloves, closed the door, and\nmarched off down the street.",
        "“Well, if we can’t we can’t,” said Holmes, cheerfully.",
        "“Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much.”",
        "“I did not wish her to tell me anything.  I only wanted to look\nat her.  However, I think that I have got all that I want.  Drive\nus to some decent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and\nafterwards we shall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the police-\nstation.”",
        "We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would\ntalk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation\nhow he had purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at\nleast five hundred guineas, at a Jew broker’s in Tottenham Court\nRoad for fifty-five shillings.  This led him to Paganini, and we\nsat for an hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote\nafter anecdote of that extraordinary man.  The afternoon was far\nadvanced and the hot glare had softened into a mellow glow before\nwe found ourselves at the police-station.  Lestrade was waiting\nfor us at the door.",
        "“A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,” said he.",
        "“Ha!  It is the answer!”  He tore it open, glanced his eyes over\nit, and crumpled it into his pocket.  “That’s all right,” said\nhe.",
        "“Have you found out anything?”",
        "“I have found out everything!”",
        "“What!” Lestrade stared at him in amazement.  “You are joking.”",
        "“I was never more serious in my life.  A shocking crime has been\ncommitted, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it.”",
        "“And the criminal?”",
        "Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting\ncards and threw it over to Lestrade.",
        "“That is the name,” he said.  “You cannot effect an arrest until\nto-morrow night at the earliest.  I should prefer that you do not\nmention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose\nto be only associated with those crimes which present some\ndifficulty in their solution.  Come on, Watson.”  We strode off\ntogether to the station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a\ndelighted face at the card which Holmes had thrown him.",
        "\n\"The case,” said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over or cigars\nthat night in our rooms at Baker Street, “is one where, as in the\ninvestigations which you have chronicled under the names of ’A\nStudy in Scarlet’ and of ’The Sign of Four,’ we have been\ncompelled to reason backward from effects to causes.  I have\nwritten to Lestrade asking him to supply us with the details\nwhich are now wanting, and which he will only get after he had\nsecured his man.  That he may be safely trusted to do, for\nalthough he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as tenacious as\na bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and indeed,\nit is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top at\nScotland Yard.”",
        "“Your case is not complete, then?” I asked.",
        "“It is fairly complete in essentials.  We know who the author of\nthe revolting business is, although one of the victims still\nescapes us.  Of course, you have formed your own conclusions.”",
        "“I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool\nboat, is the man whom you suspect?”",
        "“Oh! it is more than a suspicion.”",
        "“And yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.”",
        "“On the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear.  Let me\nrun over the principal steps.  We approached the case, you\nremember, with an absolutely blank mind, which is always an\nadvantage.  We had formed no theories.  We were simply there to\nobserve and to draw inferences from our observations.  What did\nwe see first?  A very placid and respectable lady, who seemed\nquite innocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed me that\nshe had two younger sisters.  It instantly flashed across my mind\nthat the box might have been meant for one of these.  I set the\nidea aside as one which could be disproved or confirmed at our\nleisure.  Then we went to the garden, as you remember, and we saw\nthe very singular contents of the little yellow box.",
        "“The string was of the quality which is used by sail-makers\naboard ship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in\nour investigation.  When I observed that the knot was one which\nis popular with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a\nport, and that the male ear was pierced for an earring which is\nso much more common among sailors than landsmen, I was quite\ncertain that all the actors in the tragedy were to be found among\nour seafaring classes.",
        "“When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that\nit was to Miss S. Cushing.  Now, the oldest sister would, of\ncourse, be Miss Cushing, and although her initial was ’S’ it\nmight belong to one of the others as well.  In that case we\nshould have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis\naltogether.  I therefore went into the house with the intention\nof clearing up this point.  I was about to assure Miss Cushing\nthat I was convinced that a mistake had been made when you may\nremember that I came suddenly to a stop.  The fact was that I had\njust seen something which filled me with surprise and at the same\ntime narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.",
        "“As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part\nof the body which varies so much as the human ear.  Each ear is\nas a rule quite distinctive and differs from all other ones.  In\nlast year’s Anthropological Journal you will find two short\nmonographs from my pen upon the subject.  I had, therefore,\nexamined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert and had\ncarefully noted their anatomical peculiarities.  Imagine my\nsurprise, then, when on looking at Miss Cushing I perceived that\nher ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which I had just\ninspected.  The matter was entirely beyond coincidence.  There\nwas the same shortening of the pinna, the same broad curve of the\nupper lobe, the same convolution of the inner cartilage.  In all\nessentials it was the same ear.",
        "“In the first place, her sister’s name was Sarah, and her address\nhad until recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious\nhow the mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant.\nThen we heard of this steward, married to the third sister, and\nlearned that he had at one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah\nthat she had actually gone up to Liverpool to be near the\nBrowners, but a quarrel had afterwards divided them.  This\nquarrel had put a stop to all communications for some months, so\nthat if Browner had occasion to address a packet to Miss Sarah,\nhe would undoubtedly have done so to her old address.",
        "“And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out\nwonderfully.  We had learned of the existence of this steward, an\nimpulsive man, of strong passions—you remember that he threw up\nwhat must have been a very superior berth in order to be nearer\nto his wife—subject, too, to occasional fits of hard drinking.\nWe had reason to believe that his wife had been murdered, and\nthat a man—presumably a seafaring man—had been murdered at the\nsame time.  Jealousy, of course, at once suggests itself as the\nmotive for the crime.  And why should these proofs of the deed be\nsent to Miss Sarah Cushing?  Probably because during her\nresidence in Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the\nevents which led to the tragedy.  You will observe that this line\nof boats call at Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that,\npresuming that Browner had committed the deed and had embarked at\nonce upon his steamer, the May Day, Belfast would be the first\nplace at which he cold post his terrible packet.",
        "“A second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and\nalthough I thought it exceedingly unlikely, I was determined to\nelucidate it before going further.  An unsuccessful lover might\nhave killed Mr. and Mrs. Browner, and the male ear might have\nbelonged to the husband.  There were many grave objections to\nthis theory, but it was conceivable.  I therefore sent off a\ntelegram to my friend Algar, of the Liverpool force, and asked\nhim to find our if Mrs. Browner were at home, and if Browner had\ndeparted in the May Day.  Then we went on to Wallington to visit\nMiss Sarah.",
        "“I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear\nhad been reproduced in her.  Then, of course, she might give us\nvery important information, but I was not sanguine that she\nwould.  She must have heard of the business the day before, since\nall Croydon was ringing with it, and she alone could have\nunderstood for whom the packet was meant.  If she had been\nwilling to help justice she would probably have communicated with\nthe police already.  However, it was clearly our duty to see her,\nso we went.  We found that the news of the arrival of the packet-\n-for her illness dated from that time—had such an effect upon\nher as to bring on brain fever.  It was clearer than ever that\nshe understood its full significance, but equally clear that we\nshould have to wait some time for any assistance from her.",
        "“However, we were really independent of her help.  Our answers\nwere waiting for us at the police-station, where I had directed\nAlgar to send them.  Nothing could be more conclusive.  Mrs.\nBrowner’s house had been closed for more than three days, and the\nneighbours were of opinion that she had gone south to see her\nrelatives.  It had been ascertained at the shipping offices that\nBrowner had left aboard of the May Day, and I calculate that she\nis due in the Thames tomorrow night.  When he arrives he will be\nmet by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade, and I have no doubt that\nwe shall have all our details filled in.”",
        "Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations.  Two\ndays later he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short\nnote from the detective, and a typewritten document, which\ncovered several pages of foolscap.",
        "“Lestrade has got him all right,” said Holmes, glancing up at me.\n\"Perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says.",
        "“My dear Mr. Holmes:",
        "In accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to\ntest our theories” [\"the ’we’ is rather fine, Watson, is it\nnot?\"] “I went down to the Albert Dock yesterday at 6 p.m., and\nboarded the S.S. May Day, belonging to the Liverpool, Dublin, and\nLondon Steam Packet Company.  On inquiry, I found that there was\na steward on board of the name of James Browner and that he had\nacted during the voyage in such an extraordinary manner that the\ncaptain had been compelled to relieve him of his duties.  On\ndescending to his berth, I found him seated upon a chest with his\nhead sunk upon his hands, rocking himself to and fro.  He is a\nbig, powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy—something\nlike Aldrige, who helped us in the bogus laundry affair.  He\njumped up when he heard my business, and I had my whistle to my\nlips to call a couple of river police, who were round the corner,\nbut he seemed to have no heart in him, and he held out his hands\nquietly enough for the darbies.  We brought him along to the\ncells, and his box as well, for we thought there might be\nsomething incriminating; but, bar a big sharp knife such as most\nsailors have, we got nothing for our trouble.  However, we find\nthat we shall want no more evidence, for on being brought before\nthe inspector at the station he asked leave to make a statement,\nwhich was, of course, taken down, just as he made it, by our\nshorthand man.  We had three copies typewritten, one of which I\nenclose.  The affair proves, as I always thought it would, to be\nan extremely simple one, but I am obliged to you for assisting me\nin my investigation.  With kind regards,",
        "“Yours very truly,",
        "“G. Lestrade.",
        "“Hum!  The investigation really was a very simple one,” remarked\nHolmes, “but I don’t think it struck him in that light when he\nfirst called us in.  However, let us see what Jim Browner has to\nsay for himself.  This is his statement as made before Inspector\nMontgomery at the Shadwell Police Station, and it has the\nadvantage of being verbatim.”",
        "\n\"’Have I anything to say?  Yes, I have a deal to say.  I have to\nmake a clean breast of it all.  You can hang me, or you can leave\nme alone.  I don’t care a plug which you do.  I tell you I’ve not\nshut an eye in sleep since I did it, and I don’t believe I ever\nwill again until I get past all waking.  Sometimes it’s his face,\nbut most generally it’s hers.  I’m never without one or the other\nbefore me.  He looks frowning and black-like, but she has a kind\no’ surprise upon her face.  Ay, the white lamb, she might well be\nsurprised when she read death on a face that had seldom looked\nanything but love upon her before.",
        "“’But it was Sarah’s fault, and may the curse of a broken man put\na blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins!  It’s not\nthat I want to clear myself.  I know that I went back to drink,\nlike the beast that I was.  But she would have forgiven me; she\nwould have stuck as close to me a rope to a block if that woman\nhad never darkened our door.  For Sarah Cushing loved me—that’s\nthe root of the business—she loved me until all her love turned\nto poisonous hate when she knew that I thought more of my wife’s\nfootmark in the mud than I did of her whole body and soul.",
        "“’There were three sisters altogether.  The old one was just a\ngood woman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel.\nSarah was thirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married.\nWe were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house\ntogether, and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my\nMary.  And then we asked Sarah up for a week, and the week grew\ninto a month, and one thing led to another, until she was just\none of ourselves.",
        "“’I was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little\nmoney by, and all was as bright as a new dollar.  My God, whoever\nwould have thought that it cold have come to this?  Whoever would\nhave dreamed it?",
        "“’I used to be home for the week-ends very often, and sometimes\nif the ship were held back for cargo I would have a whole week at\na time, and in this way I saw a deal of my sister-in-law, Sarah.\nShe was a fine tall woman, black and quick and fierce, with a\nproud way of carrying her head, and a glint from her eye like a\nspark from a flint. But when little Mary was there I had never a\nthought of her, and that I swear as I hope for God’s mercy.",
        "“’It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with\nme, or to coax me out for a walk with her, but I had never\nthought anything of that.  But one evening my eyes were opened.\nI had come up from the ship and found my wife out, but Sarah at\nhome.  “Where’s Mary?” I asked.  “Oh, she has gone to pay some\naccounts.”  I was impatient and paced up and down the room.\n\"Can’t you be happy for five minutes without Mary, Jim?” says\nshe.  “It’s a bad compliment to me that you can’t be contented\nwith my society for so short a time.”  “That’s all right, my\nlass,” said I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way,\nbut she had it in both hers in an instant, and they burned as if\nthey were in a fever.  I looked into her eyes and I read it all\nthere.  There was no need for her to speak, nor for me either.  I\nfrowned and drew my hand away.  Then she stood by my side in\nsilence for a bit, and then put up her hand and patted me on the\nshoulder.  “Steady old Jim!” said she, and with a kind o’ mocking\nlaugh, she ran out of the room.",
        "“’Well, from that time Sarah hated me with her whole heart and\nsoul, and she is a woman who can hate, too. I was a fool to let\nher go on biding with us—a besotted fool—but I never said a\nword to Mary, for I knew it would grieve her.  Things went on\nmuch as before, but after a time I began to find that there was a\nbit of a change in Mary herself.  She had always been so trusting\nand so innocent, but now she became queer and suspicious, wanting\nto know where I had been and what I had been doing, and whom my\nletters were from, and what I had in my pockets, and a thousand\nsuch follies.  Day by day she grew queerer and more irritable,\nand we had ceaseless rows about nothing.  I was fairly puzzled by\nit all.  Sarah avoided me now, but she and Mary were just\ninseparable.  I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and\npoisoning my wife’s mind against me, but I was such a blind\nbeetle that I could not understand it at the time.  Then I broke\nmy blue ribbon and began to drink again, but I think I should not\nhave done it if Mary had been the same as ever. She had some\nreason to be disgusted with me now, and the gap between us began\nto be wider and wider.  And then this Alec Fairbairn chipped in,\nand things became a thousand times blacker.",
        "“’It was to see Sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it\nwas to see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made\nfriends wherever he went.  He was a dashing, swaggering chap,\nsmart and curled, who had seen half the world and could talk of\nwhat he had seen.  He was good company, I won’t deny it, and he\nhad wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man, so that I\nthink there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop\nthan the forecastle.  For a month he was in and out of my house,\nand never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his\nsoft, tricky ways.  And then at last something made me suspect,\nand from that day my peace was gone forever.",
        "“’It was only a little thing, too.  I had come into the parlour\nunexpected, and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of\nwelcome on my wife’s face.  But as she saw who it was it faded\nagain, and she turned away with a look of disappointment.  That\nwas enough for me.  There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose\nstep she could have mistaken for mine.  If I could have seen him\nthen I should have killed him, for I have always been like a\nmadman when my temper gets loose.  Mary saw the devil’s light in\nmy eyes, and she ran forward with her hands on my sleeve.\n\"Don’t, Jim, don’t!” says she.  “Where’s Sarah?” I asked.  “In\nthe kitchen,” says she.  “Sarah,” says I as I went in, “this man\nFairbairn is never to darken my door again.”  “Why not?” says\nshe.  “Because I order it.”  “Oh!” says she, “if my friends are\nnot good enough for this house, then I am not good enough for it\neither.”  “You can do what you like,” says I, “but if Fairbairn\nshows his face here again I’ll send you one of his ears for a\nkeepsake.”  She was frightened by my face, I think, for she never\nanswered a word, and the same evening she left my house.",
        "“’Well, I don’t know now whether it was pure devilry on the part\nof this woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me\nagainst my wife by encouraging her to misbehave.  Anyway, she\ntook a house just two streets off and let lodgings to sailors.\nFairbairn used to stay there, and Mary would go round to have tea\nwith her sister and him.  How often she went I don’t know, but I\nfollowed her one day, and as I broke in at the door Fairbairn got\naway over the back garden wall, like the cowardly skunk that he\nwas.  I swore to my wife that I would kill her if I found her in\nhis company again, and I led her back with me, sobbing and\ntrembling, and as white as a piece of paper.  There was no trace\nof love between us any longer.  I could see that she hated me and\nfeared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she\ndespised me as well.",
        "“’Well, Sarah found that she could not make a living in\nLiverpool, so she went back, as I understand, to live with her\nsister in Croydon, and things jogged on much the same as ever at\nhome.  And then came this week and all the misery and ruin.",
        "“’It was in this way.  We had gone on the May Day for a round\nvoyage of seven days, but a hogshead got loose and started one of\nour plates, so that we had to put back into port for twelve\nhours.  I left the ship and came home, thinking what a surprise\nit would be for my wife, and hoping that maybe she would be glad\nto see me so soon.  The thought was in my head as I turned into\nmy own street, and at that moment a cab passed me, and there she\nwas, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two chatting and\nlaughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching them\nfrom the footpath.",
        "“’I tell you, and I give you my word for it, that from that\nmoment I was not my own master, and it is all like a dim dream\nwhen I look back on it.  I had been drinking hard of late, and\nthe two things together fairly turned my brain.  There’s\nsomething throbbing in my head now, like a docker’s hammer, but\nthat morning I seemed to have all Niagara whizzing and buzzing in\nmy ears.",
        "“’Well, I took to my heels, and I ran after the cab.  I had a\nheavy oak stick in my hand, and I tell you I saw red from the\nfirst; but as I ran I got cunning, too, and hung back a little to\nsee them without being seen.  They pulled up soon at the railway\nstation.  There was a good crowd round the booking-office, so I\ngot quite close to them without being seen.  They took tickets\nfor New Brighton.  So did I, but I got in three carriages behind\nthem.  When we reached it they walked along the Parade, and I was\nnever more than a hundred yards from them.  At last I saw them\nhire a boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot day, and\nthey thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water.",
        "“’It was just as if they had been given into my hands.  There was\na bit of a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred\nyards.  I hired a boat for myself, and I pulled after them.  I\ncould see the blur of their craft, but they were going nearly as\nfast as I, and they must have been a long mile from the shore\nbefore I caught them up.  The haze was like a curtain all round\nus, and there were we three in the middle of it.  My God, shall I\never forget their faces when they saw who was in the boat that\nwas closing in upon them?  She screamed out.  He swore like a\nmadman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death\nin my eyes.  I got past it and got one in with my stick that\ncrushed his head like an egg.  I would have spared her, perhaps,\nfor all my madness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out\nto him, and calling him “Alec.”  I struck again, and she lay\nstretched beside him.  I was like a wild beast then that had\ntasted blood.  If Sarah had been there, by the Lord, she should\nhave joined them.  I pulled out my knife, and—well, there! I’ve\nsaid enough.  It gave me a kind of savage joy when I thought how\nSarah would feel when she had such signs as these of what her\nmeddling had brought about.  Then I tied the bodies into the\nboat, stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk.  I knew\nvery well that the owner would think that they had lost their\nbearings in the haze, and had drifted off out to sea.  I cleaned\nmyself up, got back to land, and joined my ship without a soul\nhaving a suspicion of what had passed.  That night I made up the\npacket for Sarah Cushing, and next day I sent it from Belfast.",
        "“’There you have the whole truth of it.  You can hang me, or do\nwhat you like with me, but you cannot punish me as I have been\npunished already.  I cannot shut my eyes but I see those two\nfaces staring at me—staring at me as they stared when my boat\nbroke through the haze.  I killed them quick, but they are\nkilling me slow; and if I have another night of it I shall be\neither mad or dead before morning.  You won’t put me alone into a\ncell, sir?  For pity’s sake don’t, and may you be treated in your\nday of agony as you treat me now.’",
        "“What is the meaning of it, Watson?” said Holmes solemnly as he\nlaid down the paper.  “What object is served by this circle of\nmisery and violence and fear?  It must tend to some end, or else\nour universe is ruled by chance, which is unthinkable.  But what\nend?  There is the great standing perennial problem to which\nhuman reason is as far from an answer as ever.”",
