        "It was a strange ending to a voyage that had commenced in a most\nauspicious manner. The transatlantic steamship `La Provence’ was\na swift and comfortable vessel, under the command of a most\naffable man. The passengers constituted a select and delightful\nsociety. The charm of new acquaintances and improvised amusements\nserved to make the time pass agreeably. We enjoyed the pleasant\nsensation of being separated from the world, living, as it were,\nupon an unknown island, and consequently obliged to be sociable\nwith each other.",
        "Have you ever stopped to consider how much originality and\nspontaneity emanate from these various individuals who, on the\npreceding evening, did not even know each other, and who are now,\nfor several days, condemned to lead a life of extreme intimacy,\njointly defying the anger of the ocean, the terrible onslaught of\nthe waves, the violence of the tempest and the agonizing monotony\nof the calm and sleepy water? Such a life becomes a sort of\ntragic existence, with its storms and its grandeurs, its monotony\nand its diversity; and that is why, perhaps, we embark upon that\nshort voyage with mingled feelings of pleasure and fear.",
        "But, during the past few years, a new sensation had been added to\nthe life of the transatlantic traveler. The little floating\nisland is now attached to the world from which it was once quite\nfree. A bond united them, even in the very heart of the watery\nwastes of the Atlantic. That bond is the wireless telegraph, by\nmeans of which we receive news in the most mysterious manner. We\nknow full well that the message is not transported by the medium\nof a hollow wire. No, the mystery is even more inexplicable, more\nromantic, and we must have recourse to the wings of the air in\norder to explain this new miracle. During the first day of the\nvoyage, we felt that we were being followed, escorted, preceded\neven, by that distant voice, which, from time to time, whispered\nto one of us a few words from the receding world. Two friends\nspoke to me. Ten, twenty others sent gay or somber words of\nparting to other passengers.",
        "On the second day, at a distance of five hundred miles from the\nFrench coast, in the midst of a violent storm, we received the\nfollowing message by means of the wireless telegraph:",
        "“Arsene Lupin is on your vessel, first cabin, blonde hair, wound\nright fore-arm, traveling alone under name of R........”",
        "At that moment, a terrible flash of lightning rent the stormy\nskies. The electric waves were interrupted. The remainder of the\ndispatch never reached us. Of the name under Arsene Lupin was\nconcealing himself, we knew only the initial.",
        "If the news had been of some other character, I have no doubt that\nthe secret would have been carefully guarded by the telegraphic\noperator as well as by the officers of the vessel. But it was one\nof those events calculated to escape from the most rigorous\ndiscretion. The same day, no one knew how, the incident became a\nmatter of current gossip and every passenger was aware that the\nfamous Arsene Lupin was hiding in our midst.",
        "Arsene Lupin in our midst! the irresponsible burglar whose\nexploits had been narrated in all the newspapers during the past\nfew months! the mysterious individual with whom Ganimard, our\nshrewdest detective, had been engaged in an implacable conflict\namidst interesting and picturesque surroundings. Arsene Lupin,\nthe eccentric gentleman who operates only in the chateaux and\nsalons, and who, one night, entered the residence of Baron\nSchormann, but emerged empty-handed, leaving, however, his card on\nwhich he had scribbled these words: “Arsene Lupin, gentleman-\nburglar, will return when the furniture is genuine.” Arsene\nLupin, the man of a thousand disguises: in turn a chauffer,\ndetective, bookmaker, Russian physician, Spanish bull-fighter,\ncommercial traveler, robust youth, or decrepit old man.",
        "Then consider this startling situation: Arsene Lupin was wandering\nabout within the limited bounds of a transatlantic steamer; in\nthat very small corner of the world, in that dining saloon, in\nthat smoking room, in that music room! Arsene Lupin was, perhaps,\nthis gentleman....or that one....my neighbor at the table....\nthe sharer of my stateroom....",
        "“And this condition of affairs will last for five days!” exclaimed\nMiss Nelly Underdown, next morning. “It is unbearable! I hope he\nwill be arrested.”",
        "Then, addressing me, she added:",
        "“And you, Monsieur d’Andrezy, you are on intimate terms with the\ncaptain; surely you know something?”",
        "I should have been delighted had I possessed any information that\nwould interest Miss Nelly. She was one of those magnificent\ncreatures who inevitably attract attention in every assembly.\nWealth and beauty form an irresistible combination, and Nelly\npossessed both.",
        "Educated in Paris under the care of a French mother, she was now\ngoing to visit her father, the millionaire Underdown of Chicago.\nShe was accompanied by one of her friends, Lady Jerland.",
        "At first, I had decided to open a flirtation with her; but, in the\nrapidly growing intimacy of the voyage, I was soon impressed by\nher charming manner and my feelings became too deep and\nreverential for a mere flirtation. Moreover, she accepted my\nattentions with a certain degree of favor. She condescended to\nlaugh at my witticisms and display an interest in my stories. Yet\nI felt that I had a rival in the person of a young man with quiet\nand refined tastes; and it struck me, at times, that she preferred\nhis taciturn humor to my Parisian frivolity. He formed one in the\ncircle of admirers that surrounded Miss Nelly at the time she\naddressed to me the foregoing question. We were all comfortably\nseated in out deck-chairs. The storm of the preceding evening had\ncleared the sky. The weather was now delightful.",
        "“I have no definite knowledge, mademoiselle,” I replied, “but can\nnot we, ourselves, investigate the mystery quite as well as the\ndetective Ganimard, the personal enemy of Arsene Lupin?”",
        "“Oh! oh! you are progressing very fast, monsieur.”",
        "“Not at all, mademoiselle. In the first place, let me ask, do you\nfind the problem a complicated one?”",
        "“Very complicated.”",
        "“Have you forgotten the key we hold for the solution to the\nproblem?”",
        "“What key?”",
        "“In the first place, Lupin calls himself Monsieur R-------.”",
        "“Rather vague information,” she replied.",
        "“Secondly, he is traveling alone.”",
        "“Does that help you?” she asked.",
        "“Thirdly, he is blonde.”",
        "“Well?”",
        "“Then we have only to peruse the passenger-list, and proceed by\nprocess of elimination.”",
        "I had that list in my pocket. I took it out and glanced through\nit. Then I remarked:",
        "“I find that there are only thirteen men on the passenger-list\nwhose names begin with the letter R.”",
        "“Only thirteen?”",
        "“Yes, in the first cabin. And of those thirteen, I find that nine\nof them are accompanied by women, children or servants. That\nleaves only four who are traveling alone. First, the Marquis de\nRaverdan----”",
        "“Secretary to the American Ambassador,” interrupted Miss Nelly.\n\"I know him.”",
        "“Major Rawson,” I continued.",
        "“He is my uncle,” some one said.",
        "“Mon. Rivolta.”",
        "“Here!” exclaimed an Italian, whose face was concealed beneath a\nheavy black beard.",
        "Miss Nelly burst into laughter, and exclaimed: “That gentleman can\nscarcely be called a blonde.”",
        "“Very well, then,” I said, “we are forced to the conclusion that\nthe guilty party is the last one on the list.”",
        "“What is his name?”",
        "“Mon. Rozaine. Does anyone know him?”",
        "No one answered. But Miss Nelly turned to the taciturn young man,\nwhose attentions to her had annoyed me, and said:",
        "“Well, Monsieur Rozaine, why do you not answer?”",
        "All eyes were now turned upon him. He was a blonde. I must\nconfess that I myself felt a shock of surprise, and the profound\nsilence that followed her question indicated that the others\npresent also viewed the situation with a feeling of sudden alarm.\nHowever, the idea was an absurd one, because the gentleman in\nquestion presented an air of the most perfect innocence.",
        "“Why do I not answer?” he said. “Because, considering my name, my\nposition as a solitary traveler and the color of my hair, I have\nalready reached the same conclusion, and now think that I should\nbe arrested.”",
        "He presented a strange appearance as he uttered these words. His\nthin lips were drawn closer than usual and his face was ghastly\npale, whilst his eyes were streaked with blood. Of course, he was\njoking, yet his appearance and attitude impressed us strangely.",
        "“But you have not the wound?” said Miss Nelly, naively.",
        "“That is true,” he replied, “I lack the wound.”",
        "Then he pulled up his sleeve, removing his cuff, and showed us his\narm. But that action did not deceive me. He had shown us his\nleft arm, and I was on the point of calling his attention to the\nfact, when another incident diverted our attention. Lady Jerland,\nMiss Nelly’s friend, came running towards us in a state of great\nexcitement, exclaiming:",
        "“My jewels, my pearls! Some one has stolen them all!”",
        "No, they were not all gone, as we soon found out. The thief had\ntaken only part of them; a very curious thing. Of the diamond\nsunbursts, jeweled pendants, bracelets and necklaces, the thief\nhad taken, not the largest but the finest and most valuable\nstones. The mountings were lying upon the table. I saw them\nthere, despoiled of their jewels, like flowers from which the\nbeautiful colored petals had been ruthlessly plucked. And this\ntheft must have been committed at the time Lady Jerland was taking\nher tea; in broad daylight, in stateroom opening on a much\nfrequented corridor; moreover, the thief had been obliged to force\nopen the door of the stateroom, search for the jewel-case, which\nwas hidden at the bottom of a hat-box, open it, select his booty\nand remove it from the mountings.",
        "Of course, all the passengers instantly reached the same\nconclusion; it was the work of Arsene Lupin.",
        "That day, at the dinner table, the seats to the right and left of\nRozaine remained vacant; and, during the evening, it was rumored\nthat the captain had placed him under arrest, which information\nproduced a feeling of safety and relief. We breathed once more.\nThat evening, we resumed our games and dances. Miss Nelly,\nespecially, displayed a spirit of thoughtless gayety which\nconvinced me that if Rozaine’s attentions had been agreeable to\nher in the beginning, she had already forgotten them. Her charm\nand good-humor completed my conquest. At midnight, under a bright\nmoon, I declared my devotion with an ardor that did not seem to\ndisplease her.",
        "But, next day, to our general amazement, Rozaine was at liberty.\nWe learned that the evidence against him was not sufficient. He\nhad produced documents that were perfectly regular, which showed\nthat he was the son of a wealthy merchant of Bordeaux. Besides,\nhis arms did not bear the slightest trace of a wound.",
        "“Documents! Certificates of birth!” exclaimed the enemies of\nRozaine, “of course, Arsene Lupin will furnish you as many as you\ndesire. And as to the wound, he never had it, or he has removed\nit.”",
        "Then it was proven that, at the time of the theft, Rozaine was\npromenading on the deck. To which fact, his enemies replied that\na man like Arsene Lupin could commit a crime without being\nactually present. And then, apart from all other circumstances,\nthere remained one point which even the most skeptical could not\nanswer: Who except Rozaine, was traveling alone, was a blonde, and\nbore a name beginning with R? To whom did the telegram point, if\nit were not Rozaine?",
        "And when Rozaine, a few minutes before breakfast, came boldly\ntoward our group, Miss Nelly and Lady Jerland arose and walked\naway.",
        "An hour later, a manuscript circular was passed from hand to hand\namongst the sailors, the stewards, and the passengers of all\nclasses. It announced that Mon. Louis Rozaine offered a reward of\nten thousand francs for the discovery of Arsene Lupin or other\nperson in possession of the stolen jewels.",
        "“And if no one assists me, I will unmask the scoundrel myself,\"\ndeclared Rozaine.",
        "Rozaine against Arsene Lupin, or rather, according to current\nopinion, Arsene Lupin himself against Arsene Lupin; the contest\npromised to be interesting.",
        "Nothing developed during the next two days. We saw Rozaine\nwandering about, day and night, searching, questioning,\ninvestigating. The captain, also, displayed commendable activity.\nHe caused the vessel to be searched from stern to stern; ransacked\nevery stateroom under the plausible theory that the jewels might\nbe concealed anywhere, except in the thief’s own room.",
        "“I suppose they will find out something soon,” remarked Miss Nelly\nto me. “He may be a wizard, but he cannot make diamonds and\npearls become invisible.”",
        "“Certainly not,” I replied, “but he should examine the lining of\nour hats and vests and everything we carry with us.”",
        "Then, exhibiting my Kodak, a 9x12 with which I had been\nphotographing her in various poses, I added: “In an apparatus no\nlarger than that, a person could hide all of Lady Jerland’s\njewels. He could pretend to take pictures and no one would\nsuspect the game.”",
        "“But I have heard it said that every thief leaves some clue behind\nhim.”",
        "“That may be generally true,” I replied, “but there is one\nexception: Arsene Lupin.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because he concentrates his thoughts not only on the theft, but\non all the circumstances connected with it that could serve as a\nclue to his identity.”",
        "“A few days ago, you were more confident.”",
        "“Yes, but since I have seen him at work.”",
        "“And what do you think about it now?” she asked.",
        "“Well, in my opinion, we are wasting our time.”",
        "And, as a matter of fact, the investigation had produced no\nresult. But, in the meantime, the captain’s watch had been\nstolen. He was furious. He quickened his efforts and watched\nRozaine more closely than before. But, on the following day, the\nwatch was found in the second officer’s collar box.",
        "This incident caused considerable astonishment, and displayed the\nhumorous side of Arsene Lupin, burglar though he was, but\ndilettante as well. He combined business with pleasure. He\nreminded us of the author who almost died in a fit of laughter\nprovoked by his own play. Certainly, he was an artist in his\nparticular line of work, and whenever I saw Rozaine, gloomy and\nreserved, and thought of the double role that he was playing, I\naccorded him a certain measure of admiration.",
        "On the following evening, the officer on deck duty heard groans\nemanating from the darkest corner of the ship. He approached and\nfound a man lying there, his head enveloped in a thick gray scarf\nand his hands tied together with a heavy cord. It was Rozaine.\nHe had been assaulted, thrown down and robbed. A card, pinned to\nhis coat, bore these words: “Arsene Lupin accepts with pleasure\nthe ten thousand francs offered by Mon. Rozaine.” As a matter of\nfact, the stolen pocket-book contained twenty thousand francs.",
        "Of course, some accused the unfortunate man of having simulated\nthis attack on himself. But, apart from the fact that he could\nnot have bound himself in that manner, it was established that the\nwriting on the card was entirely different from that of Rozaine,\nbut, on the contrary, resembled the handwriting of Arsene Lupin as\nit was reproduced in an old newspaper found on board.",
        "Thus it appeared that Rozaine was not Arsene Lupin; but was\nRozaine, the son of a Bordeaux merchant. And the presence of\nArsene Lupin was once more affirmed, and that in a most alarming\nmanner.",
        "Such was the state of terror amongst the passengers that none\nwould remain alone in a stateroom or wander singly in unfrequented\nparts of the vessel. We clung together as a matter of safety.\nAnd yet the most intimate acquaintances were estranged by a mutual\nfeeling of distrust. Arsene Lupin was, now, anybody and\neverybody. Our excited imaginations attributed to him miraculous\nand unlimited power. We supposed him capable of assuming the most\nunexpected disguises; of being, by turns, the highly respectable\nMajor Rawson or the noble Marquis de Raverdan, or even--for we no\nlonger stopped with the accusing letter of R--or even such or such\na person well known to all of us, and having wife, children and\nservants.",
        "The first wireless dispatches from America brought no news; at\nleast, the captain did not communicate any to us. The silence was\nnot reassuring.",
        "Our last day on the steamer seemed interminable. We lived in\nconstant fear of some disaster. This time, it would not be a\nsimple theft or a comparatively harmless assault; it would be a\ncrime, a murder. No one imagined that Arsene Lupin would confine\nhimself to those two trifling offenses. Absolute master of the\nship, the authorities powerless, he could do whatever he pleased;\nour property and lives were at his mercy.",
        "Yet those were delightful hours for me, since they secured to me\nthe confidence of Miss Nelly. Deeply moved by those startling\nevents and being of a highly nervous nature, she spontaneously\nsought at my side a protection and security that I was pleased to\ngive her. Inwardly, I blessed Arsene Lupin. Had he not been the\nmeans of bringing me and Miss Nelly closer to each other? Thanks\nto him, I could now indulge in delicious dreams of love and\nhappiness--dreams that, I felt, were not unwelcome to Miss Nelly.\nHer smiling eyes authorized me to make them; the softness of her\nvoice bade me hope.",
        "As we approached the American shore, the active search for the\nthief was apparently abandoned, and we were anxiously awaiting the\nsupreme moment in which the mysterious enigma would be explained.\nWho was Arsene Lupin? Under what name, under what disguise was\nthe famous Arsene Lupin concealing himself? And, at last, that\nsupreme moment arrived. If I live one hundred years, I shall not\nforget the slightest details of it.",
        "“How pale you are, Miss Nelly,” I said to my companion, as she\nleaned upon my arm, almost fainting.",
        "“And you!” she replied, “ah! you are so changed.”",
        "“Just think! this is a most exciting moment, and I am delighted to\nspend it with you, Miss Nelly. I hope that your memory will\nsometimes revert---”",
        "But she was not listening. She was nervous and excited. The\ngangway was placed in position, but, before we could use it, the\nuniformed customs officers came on board. Miss Nelly murmured:",
        "“I shouldn’t be surprised to hear that Arsene Lupin escaped from\nthe vessel during the voyage.”",
        "“Perhaps he preferred death to dishonor, and plunged into the\nAtlantic rather than be arrested.”",
        "“Oh, do not laugh,” she said.",
        "Suddenly I started, and, in answer to her question, I said:",
        "“Do you see that little old man standing at the bottom of the\ngangway?”",
        "“With an umbrella and an olive-green coat?”",
        "“It is Ganimard.”",
        "“Ganimard?”",
        "“Yes, the celebrated detective who has sworn to capture Arsene\nLupin. Ah! I can understand now why we did not receive any news\nfrom this side of the Atlantic. Ganimard was here! and he always\nkeeps his business secret.”",
        "“Then you think he will arrest Arsene Lupin?”",
        "“Who can tell? The unexpected always happens when Arsene Lupin is\nconcerned in the affair.”",
        "“Oh!” she exclaimed, with that morbid curiosity peculiar to women,\n\"I should like to see him arrested.”",
        "“You will have to be patient. No doubt, Arsene Lupin has already\nseen his enemy and will not be in a hurry to leave the steamer.”",
        "The passengers were now leaving the steamer. Leaning on his\numbrella, with an air of careless indifference, Ganimard appeared\nto be paying no attention to the crowd that was hurrying down the\ngangway. The Marquis de Raverdan, Major Rawson, the Italian\nRivolta, and many others had already left the vessel before\nRozaine appeared. Poor Rozaine!",
        "“Perhaps it is he, after all,” said Miss Nelly to me. “What do\nyou think?”",
        "“I think it would be very interesting to have Ganimard and Rozaine\nin the same picture. You take the camera. I am loaded down.”",
        "I gave her the camera, but too late for her to use it. Rozaine\nwas already passing the detective. An American officer, standing\nbehind Ganimard, leaned forward and whispered in his ear. The\nFrench detective shrugged his shoulders and Rozaine passed on.\nThen, my God, who was Arsene Lupin?",
        "“Yes,” said Miss Nelly, aloud, “who can it be?”",
        "Not more than twenty people now remained on board. She\nscrutinized them one by one, fearful that Arsene Lupin was not\namongst them.",
        "“We cannot wait much longer,” I said to her.",
        "She started toward the gangway. I followed. But we had not taken\nten steps when Ganimard barred out passage.",
        "“Well, what is it?” I exclaimed.",
        "“One moment, monsieur. What’s your hurry?”",
        "“I am escorting mademoiselle.”",
        "“One moment,” he repeated, in a tone of authority. Then, gazing\ninto my eyes, he said:",
        "“Arsene Lupin, is it not?”",
        "I laughed, and replied: “No, simply Bernard d’Andrezy.”",
        "“Bernard d’Andrezy died in Macedonia three years ago.”",
        "“If Bernard d’Andrezy were dead, I should not be here. But you\nare mistaken. Here are my papers.”",
        "“They are his; and I can tell you exactly how they cam into your\npossession.”",
        "“You are a fool!” I exclaimed. “Arsene Lupin sailed under the\nname of R---”",
        "“Yes, another of your tricks; a false scent that deceived them at\nHavre. You play a good game, my boy, but this time luck is\nagainst you.”",
        "I hesitated a moment. Then he hit me a sharp blow on the right\narm, which caused me to utter a cry of pain. He had struck the\nwound, yet unhealed, referred to in the telegram.",
        "I was obliged to surrender. There was no alternative. I turned\nto Miss Nelly, who had heard everything. Our eyes met; then she\nglanced at the Kodak I had placed in her hands, and made a gesture\nthat conveyed to me the impression that she understood everything.\nYes, there, between the narrow folds of black leather, in the\nhollow centre of the small object that I had taken the precaution\nto place in her hands before Ganimard arrested me, it was there I\nhad deposited Rozaine’s twenty thousand francs and Lady Jerland’s\npearls and diamonds.",
        "Oh! I pledge my oath that, at that solemn moment, when I was in\nthe grasp of Ganimard and his two assistants, I was perfectly\nindifferent to everything, to my arrest, the hostility of the\npeople, everything except this one question: what will Miss Nelly\ndo with the things I had confided to her?",
        "In the absence of that material and conclusive proof, I had\nnothing to fear; but would Miss Nelly decide to furnish that\nproof? Would she betray me? Would she act the part of an enemy\nwho cannot forgive, or that of a woman whose scorn is softened by\nfeelings of indulgence and involuntary sympathy?",
        "She passed in front of me. I said nothing, but bowed very low.\nMingled with the other passengers, she advanced to the gangway\nwith my kodak in her hand. It occurred to me that she would not\ndare to expose me publicly, but she might do so when she reached a\nmore private place. However, when she had passed only a few feet\ndown the gangway, with a movement of simulated awkwardness, she\nlet the camera fall into the water between the vessel and the\npier. Then she walked down the gangway, and was quickly lost to\nsight in the crowd. She had passed out of my life forever.",
        "For a moment, I stood motionless. Then, to Ganimard’s great\nastonishment, I muttered:",
        "“What a pity that I am not an honest man!”",
        "Such was the story of his arrest as narrated to me by Arsene Lupin\nhimself. The various incidents, which I shall record in writing\nat a later day, have established between us certain ties....shall\nI say of friendship? Yes, I venture to believe that Arsene Lupin\nhonors me with his friendship, and that it is through friendship\nthat he occasionally calls on me, and brings, into the silence of\nmy library, his youthful exuberance of spirits, the contagion of\nhis enthusiasm, and the mirth of a man for whom destiny has naught\nbut favors and smiles.",
        "His portrait? How can I describe him? I have seen him twenty\ntimes and each time he was a different person; even he himself\nsaid to me on one occasion: “I no longer know who I am. I cannot\nrecognize myself in the mirror.” Certainly, he was a great actor,\nand possessed a marvelous faculty for disguising himself. Without\nthe slightest effort, he could adopt the voice, gestures and\nmannerisms of another person.",
        "“Why,” said he, “why should I retain a definite form and feature?\nWhy not avoid the danger of a personality that is ever the same?\nMy actions will serve to identify me.”",
        "Then he added, with a touch of pride:",
        "“So much the better if no one can ever say with absolute\ncertainty: There is Arsene Lupin! The essential point is that the\npublic may be able to refer to my work and say, without fear of\nmistake: Arsene Lupin did that!”",
        "There is no tourist worthy of the name who does not know the banks\nof the Seine, and has not noticed, in passing, the little feudal\ncastle of the Malaquis, built upon a rock in the centre of the\nriver. An arched bridge connects it with the shore. All around\nit, the calm waters of the great river play peacefully amongst the\nreeds, and the wagtails flutter over the moist crests of the\nstones.",
        "The history of the Malaquis castle is stormy like its name, harsh\nlike its outlines. It has passed through a long series of\ncombats, sieges, assaults, rapines and massacres. A recital of\nthe crimes that have been committed there would cause the stoutest\nheart to tremble. There are many mysterious legends connected\nwith the castle, and they tell us of a famous subterranean tunnel\nthat formerly led to the abbey of Jumieges and to the manor of\nAgnes Sorel, mistress of Charles VII.",
        "In that ancient habitation of heroes and brigands, the Baron\nNathan Cahorn now lived; or Baron Satan as he was formerly called\non the Bourse, where he had acquired a fortune with incredible\nrapidity. The lords of Malaquis, absolutely ruined, had been\nobliged to sell the ancient castle at a great sacrifice. It\ncontained an admirable collection of furniture, pictures, wood\ncarvings, and faience. The Baron lived there alone, attended by\nthree old servants. No one ever enters the place. No one had\never beheld the three Rubens that he possessed, his two Watteau,\nhis Jean Goujon pulpit, and the many other treasures that he had\nacquired by a vast expenditure of money at public sales.",
        "Baron Satan lived in constant fear, not for himself, but for the\ntreasures that he had accumulated with such an earnest devotion\nand with so much perspicacity that the shrewdest merchant could\nnot say that the Baron had ever erred in his taste or judgment.\nHe loved them--his bibelots. He loved them intensely, like a\nmiser; jealously, like a lover. Every day, at sunset, the iron\ngates at either end of the bridge and at the entrance to the court\nof honor are closed and barred. At the least touch on these\ngates, electric bells will ring throughout the castle.",
        "One Thursday in September, a letter-carrier presented himself at\nthe gate at the head of the bridge, and, as usual, it was the\nBaron himself who partially opened the heavy portal. He\nscrutinized the man as minutely as if he were a stranger, although\nthe honest face and twinkling eyes of the postman had been\nfamiliar to the Baron for many years. The man laughed, as he\nsaid:",
        "“It is only I, Monsieur le Baron. It is not another man wearing\nmy cap and blouse.”",
        "“One can never tell,” muttered the Baron.",
        "The man handed him a number of newspapers, and then said:",
        "“And now, Monsieur le Baron, here is something new.”",
        "“Something new?”",
        "“Yes, a letter. A registered letter.”",
        "Living as a recluse, without friends or business relations, the\nbaron never received any letters, and the one now presented to him\nimmediately aroused within him a feeling of suspicion and\ndistrust. It was like an evil omen. Who was this mysterious\ncorrespondent that dared to disturb the tranquility of his\nretreat?",
        "“You must sign for it, Monsieur le Baron.”",
        "He signed; then took the letter, waited until the postman had\ndisappeared beyond the bend in the road, and, after walking\nnervously to and fro for a few minutes, he leaned against the\nparapet of the bridge and opened the envelope. It contained a\nsheet of paper, bearing this heading: Prison de la Sante, Paris.\nHe looked at the signature: Arsene Lupin. Then he read:",
        " “Monsieur le Baron:",
        " “There is, in the gallery in your castle, a picture of Philippe\n de Champaigne, of exquisite finish, which pleases me beyond\n measure. Your Rubens are also to my taste, as well as your\n smallest Watteau. In the salon to the right, I have noticed the\n Louis XIII cadence-table, the tapestries of Beauvais, the Empire\n gueridon signed `Jacob,’ and the Renaissance chest. In the salon\n to the left, all the cabinet full of jewels and miniatures.",
        " “For the present, I will content myself with those articles that\n can be conveniently removed. I will therefore ask you to pack\n them carefully and ship them to me, charges prepaid, to the\n station at Batignolles, within eight days, otherwise I shall be\n obliged to remove them myself during the night of 27 September;\n but, under those circumstances, I shall not content myself with\n the articles above mentioned.",
        " “Accept my apologies for any inconvenience I may cause you, and\n believe me to be your humble servant,\n           “Arsene Lupin.”",
        " “P. S.--Please do not send the largest Watteau. Although you\n paid thirty thousand francs for it, it is only a copy, the\n original having been burned, under the Directoire by Barras,\n during a night of debauchery. Consult the memoirs of Garat.",
        " “I do not care for the Louis XV chatelaine, as I doubt its\n authenticity.”",
        "That letter completely upset the baron. Had it borne any other\nsignature, he would have been greatly alarmed--but signed by Arsene\nLupin!",
        "As an habitual reader of the newspapers, he was versed in the\nhistory of recent crimes, and was therefore well acquainted with\nthe exploits of the mysterious burglar. Of course, he knew that\nLupin had been arrested in America by his enemy Ganimard and was\nat present incarcerated in the Prison de la Sante. But he knew\nalso that any miracle might be expected from Arsene Lupin.\nMoreover, that exact knowledge of the castle, the location of the\npictures and furniture, gave the affair an alarming aspect. How\ncould he have acquired that information concerning things that no\none had ever seen?",
        "The baron raised his eyes and contemplated the stern outlines of\nthe castle, its steep rocky pedestal, the depth of the surrounding\nwater, and shrugged his shoulders. Certainly, there was no\ndanger. No one in the world could force an entrance to the\nsanctuary that contained his priceless treasures.",
        "No one, perhaps, but Arsene Lupin! For him, gates, walls and\ndrawbridges did not exist. What use were the most formidable\nobstacles or the most careful precautions, if Arsene Lupin had\ndecided to effect an entrance?",
        "That evening, he wrote to the Procurer of the Republique at Rouen.\nHe enclosed the threatening letter and solicited aid and\nprotection.",
        "The reply cam at once to the effect that Arsene Lupin was in\ncustody in the Prison de la Sante, under close surveillance, with\nno opportunity to write such a letter, which was, no doubt, the\nwork of some imposter. But, as an act of precaution, the Procurer\nhad submitted the letter to an expert in handwriting, who declared\nthat, in spite of certain resemblances, the writing was not that\nof the prisoner.",
        "But the words “in spite of certain resemblances” caught the\nattention of the baron; in them, he read the possibility of a\ndoubt which appeared to him quite sufficient to warrant the\nintervention of the law. His fears increased. He read Lupin’s\nletter over and over again. “I shall be obliged to remove them\nmyself.” And then there was the fixed date: the night of 27\nSeptember.",
        "To confide in his servants was a proceeding repugnant to his\nnature; but now, for the first time in many years, he experienced\nthe necessity of seeking counsel with some one. Abandoned by the\nlegal official of his own district, and feeling unable to defend\nhimself with his own resources, he was on the point of going to\nParis to engage the services of a detective.",
        "Two days passed; on the third day, he was filled with hope and joy\nas he read the following item in the `Reveil de Caudebec’, a\nnewspaper published in a neighboring town:",
        "“We have the pleasure of entertaining in our city, at the present\ntime, the veteran detective Mon. Ganimard who acquired a world-\nwide reputation by his clever capture of Arsene Lupin. He has\ncome here for rest and recreation, and, being an enthusiastic\nfisherman, he threatens to capture all the fish in our river.”",
        "Ganimard! Ah, here is the assistance desired by Baron Cahorn!\nWho could baffle the schemes of Arsene Lupin better than Ganimard,\nthe patient and astute detective? He was the man for the place.",
        "The baron did not hesitate. The town of Caudebec was only six\nkilometers from the castle, a short distance to a man whose step\nwas accelerated by the hope of safety.",
        "After several fruitless attempts to ascertain the detective’s\naddress, the baron visited the office of the `Reveil,’ situated on\nthe quai. There he found the writer of the article who,\napproaching the window, exclaimed:",
        "“Ganimard? Why, you are sure to see him somewhere on the quai\nwith his fishing-pole. I met him there and chanced to read his\nname engraved on his rod. Ah, there he is now, under the trees.”",
        "“That little man, wearing a straw hat?”",
        "“Exactly. He is a gruff fellow, with little to say.”",
        "Five minutes later, the baron approached the celebrated Ganimard,\nintroduced himself, and sought to commence a conversation, but\nthat was a failure. Then he broached the real object of his\ninterview, and briefly stated his case. The other listened,\nmotionless, with his attention riveted on his fishing-rod. When\nthe baron had finished his story, the fisherman turned, with an\nair of profound pity, and said:",
        "“Monsieur, it is not customary for thieves to warn people they are\nabout to rob. Arsene Lupin, especially, would not commit such a\nfolly.”",
        "“But---”",
        "“Monsieur, if I had the least doubt, believe me, the pleasure of\nagain capturing Arsene Lupin would place me at your disposal.\nBut, unfortunately, that young man is already under lock and key.”",
        "“He may have escaped.”",
        "“No one ever escaped from the Sante.”",
        "“But, he---”",
        "“He, no more than any other.”",
        "“Yet---”",
        "“Well, if he escapes, so much the better. I will catch him again.\nMeanwhile, you go home and sleep soundly. That will do for the\npresent. You frighten the fish.”",
        "The conversation was ended. The baron returned to the castle,\nreassured to some extent by Ganimard’s indifference. He examined\nthe bolts, watched the servants, and, during the next forty-eight\nhours, he became almost persuaded that his fears were groundless.\nCertainly, as Ganimard had said, thieves do not warn people they\nare about to rob.",
        "The fateful day was close at hand. It was now the twenty-sixth of\nSeptember and nothing had happened. But at three o’clock the bell\nrang. A boy brought this telegram:",
        "“No goods at Batignolles station. Prepare everything for tomorrow\nnight. Arsene.”",
        "This telegram threw the baron into such a state of excitement that\nhe even considered the advisability of yielding to Lupin’s\ndemands.",
        "However, he hastened to Caudebec. Ganimard was fishing at the\nsame place, seated on a campstool. Without a word, he handed him\nthe telegram.",
        "“Well, what of it?” said the detective.",
        "“What of it? But it is tomorrow.”",
        "“What is tomorrow?”",
        "“The robbery! The pillage of my collections!”",
        "Ganimard laid down his fishing-rod, turned to the baron, and\nexclaimed, in a tone of impatience:",
        "“Ah! Do you think I am going to bother myself about such a silly\nstory as that!”",
        "“How much do you ask to pass tomorrow night in the castle?”",
        "“Not a sou. Now, leave me alone.”",
        "“Name your own price. I am rich and can pay it.”",
        "This offer disconcerted Ganimard, who replied, calmly:",
        "“I am here on a vacation. I have no right to undertake such\nwork.”",
        "“No one will know. I promise to keep it secret.”",
        "“Oh! nothing will happen.”",
        "“Come! three thousand francs. Will that be enough?”",
        "The detective, after a moment’s reflection, said:",
        "“Very well. But I must warn you that you are throwing your money\nout of the window.”",
        "“I do not care.”",
        "“In that case...but, after all, what do we know about this devil\nLupin! He may have quite a numerous band of robbers with him.\nAre you sure of your servants?”",
        "“My faith---”",
        "“Better not count on them. I will telegraph for two of my men to\nhelp me. And now, go! It is better for us not to be seen\ntogether. Tomorrow evening about nine o’clock.”",
        "The following day--the date fixed by Arsene Lupin--Baron Cahorn\narranged all his panoply of war, furbished his weapons, and, like\na sentinel, paced to and fro in front of the castle. He saw\nnothing, heard nothing. At half-past eight o’clock in the\nevening, he dismissed his servants. They occupied rooms in a wing\nof the building, in a retired spot, well removed from the main\nportion of the castle. Shortly thereafter, the baron heard the\nsound of approaching footsteps. It was Ganimard and his two\nassistants--great, powerful fellows with immense hands, and necks\nlike bulls. After asking a few questions relating to the location\nof the various entrances and rooms, Ganimard carefully closed and\nbarricaded all the doors and windows through which one could gain\naccess to the threatened rooms. He inspected the walls, raised\nthe tapestries, and finally installed his assistants in the\ncentral gallery which was located between the two salons.",
        "“No nonsense! We are not here to sleep. At the slightest sound,\nopen the windows of the court and call me. Pay attention also to\nthe water-side. Ten metres of perpendicular rock is no obstacle\nto those devils.”",
        "Ganimard locked his assistants in the gallery, carried away the\nkeys, and said to the baron:",
        "“And now, to our post.”",
        "He had chosen for himself a small room located in the thick outer\nwall, between the two principal doors, and which, in former years,\nhad been the watchman’s quarters. A peep-hole opened upon the\nbridge; another on the court. In one corner, there was an opening\nto a tunnel.",
        "“I believe you told me, Monsieur le Baron, that this tunnel is the\nonly subterranean entrance to the castle and that it has been\nclosed up for time immemorial?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Then, unless there is some other entrance, known only to Arsene\nLupin, we are quite safe.”",
        "He placed three chairs together, stretched himself upon them,\nlighted his pipe and sighed:",
        "“Really, Monsieur le Baron, I feel ashamed to accept your money\nfor such a sinecure as this. I will tell the story to my friend\nLupin. He will enjoy it immensely.”",
        "The baron did not laugh. He was anxiously listening, but heard\nnothing save the beating of his own heart. From time to time, he\nleaned over the tunnel and cast a fearful eye into its depths. He\nheard the clock strike eleven, twelve, one.",
        "Suddenly, he seized Ganimard’s arm. The latter leaped up,\nawakened from his sleep.",
        "“Do you hear?” asked the baron, in a whisper.",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“What is it?”",
        "“I was snoring, I suppose.”",
        "“No, no, listen.”",
        "“Ah! yes, it is the horn of an automobile.”",
        "“Well?”",
        "“Well! it is very improbable that Lupin would use an automobile\nlike a battering-ram to demolish your castle. Come, Monsieur le\nBaron, return to your post. I am going to sleep. Good-night.”",
        "That was the only alarm. Ganimard resumed his interrupted\nslumbers, and the baron heard nothing except the regular snoring\nof his companion. At break of day, they left the room. The\ncastle was enveloped in a profound calm; it was a peaceful dawn on\nthe bosom of a tranquil river. They mounted the stairs, Cahorn\nradiant with joy, Ganimard calm as usual. They heard no sound;\nthey saw nothing to arouse suspicion.",
        "“What did I tell you, Monsieur le Baron? Really, I should not\nhave accepted your offer. I am ashamed.”",
        "He unlocked the door and entered the gallery. Upon two chairs,\nwith drooping heads and pendent arms, the detective’s two\nassistants were asleep.",
        "“Tonnerre de nom d’un chien!” exclaimed Ganimard. At the same\nmoment, the baron cried out:",
        "“The pictures! The credence!”",
        "He stammered, choked, with arms outstretched toward the empty\nplaces, toward the denuded walls where naught remained but the\nuseless nails and cords. The Watteau, disappeared! The Rubens,\ncarried away! The tapestries taken down! The cabinets, despoiled\nof their jewels!",
        "“And my Louis XVI candelabra! And the Regent chandelier!...And\nmy twelfth-century Virgin!”",
        "He ran from one spot to another in wildest despair. He recalled\nthe purchase price of each article, added up the figures, counted\nhis losses, pell-mell, in confused words and unfinished phrases.\nHe stamped with rage; he groaned with grief. He acted like a\nruined man whose only hope is suicide.",
        "If anything could have consoled him, it would have been the\nstupefaction displayed by Ganimard. The famous detective did not\nmove. He appeared to be petrified; he examined the room in a\nlistless manner. The windows?....closed. The locks on the\ndoors?....intact. Not a break in the ceiling; not a hole in the\nfloor. Everything was in perfect order. The theft had been\ncarried out methodically, according to a logical and inexorable\nplan.",
        "“Arsene Lupin....Arsene Lupin,” he muttered.",
        "Suddenly, as if moved by anger, he rushed upon his two assistants\nand shook them violently. They did not awaken.",
        "“The devil!” he cried. “Can it be possible?”",
        "He leaned over them and, in turn, examined them closely. They\nwere asleep; but their response was unnatural.",
        "“They have been drugged,” he said to the baron.",
        "“By whom?”",
        "“By him, of course, or his men under his discretion. That work\nbears his stamp.”",
        "“In that case, I am lost--nothing can be done.”",
        "“Nothing,” assented Ganimard.",
        "“It is dreadful; it is monstrous.”",
        "“Lodge a complaint.”",
        "“What good will that do?”",
        "“Oh; it is well to try it. The law has some resources.”",
        "“The law! Bah! it is useless. You represent the law, and, at\nthis moment, when you should be looking for a clue and trying to\ndiscover something, you do not even stir.”",
        "“Discover something with Arsene Lupin! Why, my dear monsieur,\nArsene Lupin never leaves any clue behind him. He leaves nothing\nto chance. Sometimes I think he put himself in my way and simply\nallowed me to arrest him in America.”",
        "“Then, I must renounce my pictures! He has taken the gems of my\ncollection. I would give a fortune to recover them. If there is\nno other way, let him name his own price.”",
        "Ganimard regarded the baron attentively, as he said:",
        "“Now, that is sensible. Will you stick to it?”",
        "“Yes, yes. But why?”",
        "“An idea that I have.”",
        "“What is it?”",
        "“We will discuss it later--if the official examination does not\nsucceed. But, not one word about me, if you wish my assistance.”",
        "He added, between his teeth:",
        "“It is true I have nothing to boast of in this affair.”",
        "The assistants were gradually regaining consciousness with the\nbewildered air of people who come out of an hypnotic sleep. They\nopened their eyes and looked about them in astonishment. Ganimard\nquestioned them; they remembered nothing.",
        "“But you must have seen some one?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Can’t you remember?”",
        "“No, no.”",
        "“Did you drink anything?”",
        "They considered a moment, and then one of them replied:",
        "“Yes, I drank a little water.”",
        "“Out of that carafe?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“So did I,” declared the other.",
        "Ganimard smelled and tasted it. It had no particular taste and no\nodor.",
        "“Come,” he said, “we are wasting our time here. One can’t decide\nan Arsene Lupin problem in five minutes. But, morbleau! I swear\nI will catch him again.”",
        "The same day, a charge of burglary was duly performed by Baron\nCahorn against Arsene Lupin, a prisoner in the Prison de la Sante.",
        "The baron afterwards regretted making the charge against Lupin\nwhen he saw his castle delivered over to the gendarmes, the\nprocureur, the judge d’instruction, the newspaper reporters and\nphotographers, and a throng of idle curiosity-seekers.",
        "The affair soon became a topic of general discussion, and the name\nof Arsene Lupin excited the public imagination to such an extent\nthat the newspapers filled their columns with the most fantastic\nstories of his exploits which found ready credence amongst their\nreaders.",
        "But the letter of Arsene Lupin that was published in the `Echo de\nFrance’ (no once ever knew how the newspaper obtained it), that\nletter in which Baron Cahorn was impudently warned of the coming\ntheft, caused considerable excitement. The most fabulous theories\nwere advanced. Some recalled the existence of the famous\nsubterranean tunnels, and that was the line of research pursued by\nthe officers of the law, who searched the house from top to\nbottom, questioned every stone, studied the wainscoting and the\nchimneys, the window-frames and the girders in the ceilings. By\nthe light of torches, they examined the immense cellars where the\nlords of Malaquis were wont to store their munitions and\nprovisions. They sounded the rocky foundation to its very centre.\nBut it was all in vain. They discovered no trace of a subterranean\ntunnel. No secret passage existed.",
        "But the eager public declared that the pictures and furniture\ncould not vanish like so many ghosts. They are substantial,\nmaterial things and require doors and windows for their exits and\ntheir entrances, and so do the people that remove them. Who were\nthose people? How did they gain access to the castle? And how\ndid they leave it?",
        "The police officers of Rouen, convinced of their own impotence,\nsolicited the assistance of the Parisian detective force. Mon.\nDudouis, chief of the Surete, sent the best sleuths of the iron\nbrigade. He himself spent forty-eight hours at the castle, but\nmet with no success. Then he sent for Ganimard, whose past\nservices had proved so useful when all else failed.",
        "Ganimard listened, in silence, to the instructions of his\nsuperior; then, shaking his head, he said:",
        "“In my opinion, it is useless to ransack the castle. The solution\nof the problem lies elsewhere.”",
        "“Where, then?”",
        "“With Arsene Lupin.”",
        "“With Arsene Lupin! To support that theory, we must admit his\nintervention.”",
        "“I do admit it. In fact, I consider it quite certain.”",
        "“Come, Ganimard, that is absurd. Arsene Lupin is in prison.”",
        "“I grant you that Arsene Lupin is in prison, closely guarded; but\nhe must have fetters on his feet, manacles on his wrists, and gag\nin his mouth before I change my opinion.”",
        "“Why so obstinate, Ganimard?”",
        "“Because Arsene Lupin is the only man in France of sufficient\ncalibre to invent and carry out a scheme of that magnitude.”",
        "“Mere words, Ganimard.”",
        "“But true ones. Look! What are they doing? Searching for\nsubterranean passages, stones swinging on pivots, and other nonsense\nof that kind. But Lupin doesn’t employ such old-fashioned methods.\nHe is a modern cracksman, right up to date.”",
        "“And how would you proceed?”",
        "“I should ask your permission to spend an hour with him.”",
        "“In his cell?”",
        "“Yes. During the return trip from America we became very\nfriendly, and I venture to say that if he can give me any\ninformation without compromising himself he will not hesitate to\nsave me from incurring useless trouble.”",
        "It was shortly after noon when Ganimard entered the cell of Arsene\nLupin. The latter, who was lying on his bed, raised his head and\nuttered a cry of apparent joy.",
        "“Ah! This is a real surprise. My dear Ganimard, here!”",
        "“Ganimard himself.”",
        "“In my chosen retreat, I have felt a desire for many things, but\nmy fondest wish was to receive you here.”",
        "“Very kind of you, I am sure.”",
        "“Not at all. You know I hold you in the highest regard.”",
        "“I am proud of it.”",
        "“I have always said: Ganimard is our best detective. He is\nalmost,--you see how candid I am!--he is almost as clever as\nSherlock Holmes. But I am sorry that I cannot offer you anything\nbetter than this hard stool. And no refreshments! Not even a\nglass of beer! Of course, you will excuse me, as I am here only\ntemporarily.”",
        "Ganimard smiled, and accepted the proffered seat. Then the\nprisoner continued:",
        "“Mon Dieu, how pleased I am to see the face of an honest man. I\nam so tired of those devils of spies who come here ten times a day\nto ransack my pockets and my cell to satisfy themselves that I am\nnot preparing to escape. The government is very solicitous on my\naccount.”",
        "“It is quite right.”",
        "“Why so? I should be quite contented if they would allow me to\nlive in my own quiet way.”",
        "“On other people’s money.”",
        "“Quite so. That would be so simple. But here, I am joking, and\nyou are, no doubt, in a hurry. So let us come to business,\nGanimard. To what do I owe the honor of this visit?",
        "“The Cahorn affair,” declared Ganimard, frankly.",
        "“Ah! Wait, one moment. You see I have had so many affairs!\nFirst, let me fix in my mind the circumstances of this particular\ncase....Ah! yes, now I have it. The Cahorn affair, Malaquis\ncastle, Seine-Inferieure....Two Rubens, a Watteau, and a few\ntrifling articles.”",
        "“Trifling!”",
        "“Oh! ma foi, all that is of slight importance. But it suffices to\nknow that the affair interests you. How can I serve you,\nGanimard?”",
        "“Must I explain to you what steps the authorities have taken in\nthe matter?”",
        "“Not at all. I have read the newspapers and I will frankly state\nthat you have made very little progress.”",
        "“And that is the reason I have come to see you.”",
        "“I am entirely at your service.”",
        "“In the first place, the Cahorn affair was managed by you?”",
        "“From A to Z.”",
        "“The letter of warning? the telegram?”",
        "“All mine. I ought to have the receipts somewhere.”",
        "Arsene opened the drawer of a small table of plain white wood\nwhich, with the bed and stool, constituted all the furniture in\nhis cell, and took therefrom two scraps of paper which he handed\nto Ganimard.",
        "“Ah!” exclaimed the detective, in surprise, “I though you were\nclosely guarded and searched, and I find that you read the\nnewspapers and collect postal receipts.”",
        "“Bah! these people are so stupid! They open the lining of my\nvest, they examine the soles of my shoes, they sound the walls of\nmy cell, but they never imagine that Arsene Lupin would be foolish\nenough to choose such a simple hiding place.”",
        "Ganimard laughed, as he said:",
        "“What a droll fellow you are! Really, you bewilder me. But, come\nnow, tell me about the Cahorn affair.”",
        "“Oh! oh! not quite so fast! You would rob me of all my secrets;\nexpose all my little tricks. That is a very serious matter.”",
        "“Was I wrong to count on your complaisance?”",
        "“No, Ganimard, and since you insist---”",
        "Arsene Lupin paced his cell two or three times, then, stopping\nbefore Ganimard, he asked:",
        "“What do you think of my letter to the baron?”",
        "“I think you were amusing yourself by playing to the gallery.”",
        "“Ah! playing to the gallery! Come, Ganimard, I thought you knew\nme better. Do I, Arsene Lupin, ever waste my time on such\npuerilities? Would I have written that letter if I could have\nrobbed the baron without writing to him? I want you to understand\nthat the letter was indispensable; it was the motor that set the\nwhole machine in motion. Now, let us discuss together a scheme\nfor the robbery of the Malaquis castle. Are you willing?”",
        "“Yes, proceed.”",
        "“Well, let us suppose a castle carefully closed and barricaded\nlike that of the Baron Cahorn. Am I to abandon my scheme and\nrenounce the treasures that I covet, upon the pretext that the\ncastle which holds them is inaccessible?”",
        "“Evidently not.”",
        "“Should I make an assault upon the castle at the head of a band of\nadventurers as they did in ancient times?”",
        "“That would be foolish.”",
        "“Can I gain admittance by stealth or cunning?”",
        "“Impossible.”",
        "“Then there is only one way open to me. I must have the owner of\nthe castle invite me to it.”",
        "“That is surely an original method.”",
        "“And how easy! Let us suppose that one day the owner receives a\nletter warning him that a notorious burglar known as Arsene Lupin\nis plotting to rob him. What will he do?”",
        "“Send a letter to the Procureur.”",
        "“Who will laugh at him, because the said Arsene Lupin is actually\nin prison. Then, in his anxiety and fear, the simple man will\nask the assistance of the first-comer, will he not?”",
        "“Very likely.”",
        "“And if he happens to read in a country newspaper that a\ncelebrated detective is spending his vacation in a neighboring\ntown---”",
        "“He will seek that detective.”",
        "“Of course. But, on the other hand, let us presume that, having\nforeseen that state of affairs, the said Arsene Lupin has\nrequested one of his friends to visit Caudebec, make the\nacquaintance of the editor of the `Reveil,’ a newspaper to which\nthe baron is a subscriber, and let said editor understand that\nsuch person is the celebrated detective--then, what will happen?”",
        "“The editor will announce in the `Reveil’ the presence in Caudebec\nof said detective.”",
        "“Exactly; and one of two things will happen: either the fish--I\nmean Cahorn--will not bite, and nothing will happen; or, what is\nmore likely, he will run and greedily swallow the bait. Thus,\nbehold my Baron Cahorn imploring the assistance of one of my\nfriends against me.”",
        "“Original, indeed!”",
        "“Of course, the pseudo-detective at first refuses to give any\nassistance. On top of that comes the telegram from Arsene Lupin.\nThe frightened baron rushes once more to my friend and offers him\na definite sum of money for his services. My friend accepts and\nsummons two members of our band, who, during the night, whilst\nCahorn is under the watchful eye of his protector, removes certain\narticles by way of the window and lowers them with ropes into a\nnice little launch chartered for the occasion. Simple, isn’t it?”",
        "“Marvelous! Marvelous!” exclaimed Ganimard. “The boldness of the\nscheme and the ingenuity of all its details are beyond criticism.\nBut who is the detective whose name and fame served as a magnet to\nattract the baron and draw him into your net?”",
        "“There is only one name could do it--only one.”",
        "“And that is?”",
        "“Arsene Lupin’s personal enemy--the most illustrious Ganimard.”",
        "“I?”",
        "“Yourself, Ganimard. And, really, it is very funny. If you go\nthere, and the baron decides to talk, you will find that it will\nbe your duty to arrest yourself, just as you arrested me in\nAmerica. Hein! the revenge is really amusing: I cause Ganimard to\narrest Ganimard.”",
        "Arsene Lupin laughed heartily. The detective, greatly vexed, bit\nhis lips; to him the joke was quite devoid of humor. The arrival\nof a prison guard gave Ganimard an opportunity to recover himself.\nThe man brought Arsene Lupin’s luncheon, furnished by a\nneighboring restaurant. After depositing the tray upon the table,\nthe guard retired. Lupin broke his bread, ate a few morsels, and\ncontinued:",
        "“But, rest easy, my dear Ganimard, you will not go to Malaquis. I\ncan tell you something that will astonish you: the Cahorn affair\nis on the point of being settled.”",
        "“Excuse me; I have just seen the Chief of the Surete.”",
        "“What of that? Does Mon. Dudouis know my business better than I\ndo myself? You will learn that Ganimard--excuse me--that the\npseudo-Ganimard still remains on very good terms with the baron.\nThe latter has authorized him to negotiate a very delicate\ntransaction with me, and, at the present moment, in consideration\nof a certain sum, it is probable that the baron has recovered\npossession of his pictures and other treasures. And on their\nreturn, he will withdraw his complaint. Thus, there is no longer\nany theft, and the law must abandon the case.”",
        "Ganimard regarded the prisoner with a bewildered air.",
        "“And how do you know all that?”",
        "“I have just received the telegram I was expecting.”",
        "“You have just received a telegram?”",
        "“This very moment, my dear friend. Out of politeness, I did not\nwish to read it in your presence. But if you will permit me---”",
        "“You are joking, Lupin.”",
        "“My dear friend, if you will be so kind as to break that egg, you\nwill learn for yourself that I am not joking.”",
        "Mechanically, Ganimard obeyed, and cracked the egg-shell with the\nblade of a knife. He uttered a cry of surprise. The shell\ncontained nothing but a small piece of blue paper. At the request\nof Arsene he unfolded it. It was a telegram, or rather a portion\nof a telegram from which the post-marks had been removed. It read\nas follows:",
        "“Contract closed. Hundred thousand balls delivered. All well.”",
        "“One hundred thousand balls?” said Ganimard.",
        "“Yes, one hundred thousand francs. Very little, but then, you\nknow, these are hard times....And I have some heavy bills to meet.\nIf you only knew my budget....living in the city comes very high.”",
        "Ganimard arose. His ill humor had disappeared. He reflected for\na moment, glancing over the whole affair in an effort to discover\na weak point; then, in a tone and manner that betrayed his\nadmiration of the prisoner, he said:",
        "“Fortunately, we do not have a dozen such as you to deal with; if\nwe did, we would have to close up shop.”",
        "Arsene Lupin assumed a modest air, as he replied:",
        "“Bah! a person must have some diversion to occupy his leisure\nhours, especially when he is in prison.”",
        "“What!” exclaimed Ganimard, “your trial, your defense, the\nexamination--isn’t that sufficient to occupy your mind?”",
        "“No, because I have decided not to be present at my trial.”",
        "“Oh! oh!”",
        "Arsene Lupin repeated, positively:",
        "“I shall not be present at my trial.”",
        "“Really!”",
        "“Ah! my dear monsieur, do you suppose I am going to rot upon the\nwet straw? You insult me. Arsene Lupin remains in prison just as\nlong as it pleases him, and not one minute more.”",
        "“Perhaps it would have been more prudent if you had avoided\ngetting there,” said the detective, ironically.",
        "“Ah! monsieur jests? Monsieur must remember that he had the honor\nto effect my arrest. Know then, my worthy friend, that no one,\nnot even you, could have placed a hand upon me if a much more\nimportant event had occupied my attention at that critical\nmoment.”",
        "“You astonish me.”",
        "“A woman was looking at me, Ganimard, and I loved her. Do you\nfully understand what that means: to be under the eyes of a woman\nthat one loves? I cared for nothing in the world but that. And\nthat is why I am here.”",
        "“Permit me to say: you have been here a long time.”",
        "“In the first place, I wished to forget. Do not laugh; it was a\ndelightful adventure and it is still a tender memory. Besides, I\nhave been suffering from neurasthenia. Life is so feverish these\ndays that it is necessary to take the `rest cure’ occasionally,\nand I find this spot a sovereign remedy for my tired nerves.”",
        "“Arsene Lupin, you are not a bad fellow, after all.”",
        "“Thank you,” said Lupin. “Ganimard, this is Friday. On Wednesday\nnext, at four o’clock in the afternoon, I will smoke my cigar at\nyour house in the rue Pergolese.”",
        "“Arsene Lupin, I will expect you.”",
        "They shook hands like two old friends who valued each other at\ntheir true worth; then the detective stepped to the door.",
        "“Ganimard!”",
        "“What is it?” asked Ganimard, as he turned back.",
        "“You have forgotten your watch.”",
        "“My watch?”",
        "“Yes, it strayed into my pocket.”",
        "He returned the watch, excusing himself”",
        "“Pardon me....a bad habit. Because they have taken mine is nor\nreason why I should take yours. Besides, I have a chronometer\nhere that satisfies me fairly well.”",
        "He took from the drawer a large gold watch and heavy chain.",
        "“From whose pocket did that come?” asked Ganimard.",
        "Arsene Lupin gave a hasty glance at the initials engraved on the\nwatch.",
        "“J.B.....Who the devil can that be?....Ah! yes, I remember. Jules\nBouvier, the judge who conducted my examination. A charming\nfellow!....”",
        "Arsene Lupin had just finished his repast and taken from his\npocket and excellent cigar, with a gold band, which he was\nexamining with unusual care, when the door of his cell was opened.\nHe had barely time to throw the cigar into the drawer and move\naway from the table. The guard entered. It was the hour for\nexercise.",
        "“I was waiting for you, my dear boy,” exclaimed Lupin, in his\naccustomed good humor.",
        "They went out together. As soon as they had disappeared at a turn\nin the corridor, two men entered the cell and commenced a minute\nexamination of it. One was Inspector Dieuzy; the other was\nInspector Folenfant. They wished to verify their suspicion that\nArsene Lupin was in communication with his accomplices outside of\nthe prison. On the preceding evening, the `Grand Journal’ had\npublished these lines addressed to its court reporter:",
        "“Monsieur:\n\"In a recent article you referred to me in most unjustifiable\nterms. Some days before the opening of my trial I will call you\nto account.       Arsene Lupin.”",
        "The handwriting was certainly that of Arsene Lupin. Consequently,\nhe sent letters; and, no doubt, received letters. It was certain\nthat he was preparing for that escape thus arrogantly announced by\nhim.",
        "The situation had become intolerable. Acting in conjunction with\nthe examining judge, the chief of the Surete, Mon. Dudouis, had\nvisited the prison and instructed the gaoler in regard to the\nprecautions necessary to insure Lupin’s safety. At the same time,\nhe sent the two men to examine the prisoner’s cell. They raised\nevery stone, ransacked the bed, did everything customary in such a\ncase, but they discovered nothing, and were about to abandon their\ninvestigation when the guard entered hastily and said:",
        "“The drawer....look in the table-drawer. When I entered just now\nhe was closing it.”",
        "They opened the drawer, and Dieuzy exclaimed:",
        "“Ah! we have him this time.”",
        "Folenfant stopped him.",
        "“Wait a moment. The chief will want to make an inventory.”",
        "“This is a very choice cigar.”",
        "“Leave it there, and notify the chief.”",
        "Two minutes later Mon. Dudouis examined the contents of the\ndrawer. First he discovered a bundle of newspaper clippings\nrelating to Arsene Lupin taken from the `Argus de la Presse,’ then\na tobacco-box, a pipe, some paper called “onion-peel,” and two\nbooks. He read the titles of the books. One was an English\nedition of Carlyle’s “Hero-worship\"; the other was a charming\nelzevir, in modern binding, the “Manual of Epictetus,” a German\ntranslation published at Leyden in 1634. On examining the books,\nhe found that all the pages were underlined and annotated. Were\nthey prepared as a code for correspondence, or did they simply\nexpress the studious character of the reader? Then he examined\nthe tobacco-box and the pipe. Finally, he took up the famous\ncigar with its gold band.",
        "“Fichtre!” he exclaimed. “Our friend smokes a good cigar. It’s a\nHenry Clay.”",
        "With the mechanical action of an habitual smoker, he placed the\ncigar close to his ear and squeezed it to make it crack.\nImmediately he uttered a cry of surprise. The cigar had yielded\nunder the pressure of his fingers. He examined it more closely,\nand quickly discovered something white between the leaves of\ntobacco. Delicately, with the aid of a pin, he withdrew a roll of\nvery thin paper, scarcely larger than a toothpick. It was a\nletter. He unrolled it, and found these words, written in a\nfeminine handwriting:",
        "“The basket has taken the place of the others. Eight out of ten\nare ready. On pressing the outer foot the plate goes downward.\nFrom twelve to sixteen every day, H-P will wait. But where?\nReply at once. Rest easy; your friend is watching over you.”",
        "Mon. Dudouis reflected a moment, then said:",
        "“It is quite clear....the basket....the eight compartments....\nFrom twelve to sixteen mean from twelve to four o’clock.”",
        "“But this H-P, that will wait?”",
        "“H-P must mean automobile. H-P, horsepower, is the way they\nindicate strength of the motor. A twenty-four H-P is an\nautomobile of twenty-four horsepower.”",
        "Then he rose, and asked:",
        "“Had the prisoner finished his breakfast?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“And as he has not yet read the message, which is proved by the\ncondition of the cigar, it is probable that he had just received\nit.”",
        "“How?”",
        "“In his food. Concealed in his bread of in a potato, perhaps.”",
        "“Impossible. His food was allowed to be brought in simply to trap\nhim, but we have never found anything in it.”",
        "“We will look for Lupin’s reply this evening. Detain him outside\nfor a few minutes. I shall take this to the examining judge, and,\nif he agrees with me, we will have the letter photographed at\nonce, and in an hour you can replace the letter in the drawer in a\ncigar similar to this. The prisoner must have no cause for\nsuspicion.”",
        "It was not without a certain curiosity that Mon. Dudouis returned\nto the prison in the evening, accompanied by Inspector Dieuzy.\nThree empty plates were sitting on the stove in the corner.",
        "“He has eaten?”",
        "“Yes,” replied the guard.",
        "“Dieuzy, please cut that macaroni into very small pieces, and open\nthat bread-roll....Nothing?”",
        "“No, chief.”",
        "Mon. Dudouis examined the plates, the fork, the spoon, and the\nknife--an ordinary knife with a rounded blade. He turned the\nhandle to the left; then to the right. It yielded and unscrewed.\nThe knife was hollow, and served as a hiding-place for a sheet of\npaper.",
        "“Peuh!” he said, “that is not very clever for a man like Arsene.\nBut we mustn’t lose any time. You, Dieuzy, go and search the\nrestaurant.”",
        "Then he read the note:",
        "“I trust to you, H-P will follow at a distance every day. I will\ngo ahead. Au revoir, dear friend.”",
        "“At last,” cried Mon. Dudouis, rubbing his hands gleefully, “I\nthink we have the affair in our own hands. A little strategy on\nour part, and the escape will be a success in so far as the arrest\nof his confederates are concerned.”",
        "“But if Arsene Lupin slips through your fingers?” suggested the\nguard.",
        "“We will have a sufficient number of men to prevent that. If,\nhowever, he displays too much cleverness, ma foi, so much the\nworse for him! As to his band of robbers, since the chief refuses\nto speak, the others must.”",
        "And, as a matter of fact, Arsene Lupin had very little to say.\nFor several months, Mon. Jules Bouvier, the examining judge, had\nexerted himself in vain. The investigation had been reduced to a\nfew uninteresting arguments between the judge and the advocate,\nMaitre Danval, one of the leaders of the bar. From time to time,\nthrough courtesy, Arsene Lupin would speak. One day he said:",
        "“Yes, monsieur, le judge, I quite agree with you: the robbery of\nthe Credit Lyonnais, the theft in the rue de Babylone, the issue\nof the counterfeit bank-notes, the burglaries at the various\nchateaux, Armesnil, Gouret, Imblevain, Groseillers, Malaquis, all\nmy work, monsieur, I did it all.”",
        "“Then will you explain to me---”",
        "“It is useless. I confess everything in a lump, everything and\neven ten times more than you know nothing about.”",
        "Wearied by his fruitless task, the judge had suspended his\nexaminations, but he resumed them after the two intercepted\nmessages were brought to his attention; and regularly, at mid-day,\nArsene Lupin was taken from the prison to the Depot in the\nprison-van with a certain number of other prisoners. They\nreturned about three or four o’clock.",
        "Now, one afternoon, this return trip was made under unusual\nconditions. The other prisoners not having been examined, it was\ndecided to take back Arsene Lupin first, thus he found himself\nalone in the vehicle.",
        "These prison-vans, vulgarly called “panniers a salade\"--or salad-\nbaskets--are divided lengthwise by a central corridor from which\nopen ten compartments, five on either side. Each compartment is\nso arranged that the occupant must assume and retain a sitting\nposture, and, consequently, the five prisoners are seated one upon\nthe other, and yet separated one from the other by partitions. A\nmunicipal guard, standing at one end, watches over the corridor.",
        "Arsene was placed in the third cell on the right, and the heavy\nvehicle started. He carefully calculated when they left the quai\nde l’Horloge, and when they passed the Palais de Justice. Then,\nabout the centre of the bridge Saint Michel, with his outer foot,\nthat is to say, his right foot, he pressed upon the metal place\nthat closed his cell. Immediately something clicked, and the\nmetal plate moved. He was able to ascertain that he was located\nbetween the two wheels.",
        "He waited, keeping a sharp look-out. The vehicle was proceeding\nslowly along the boulevard Saint Michel. At the corner of Saint\nGermain it stopped. A truck horse had fallen. The traffic having\nbeen interrupted, a cast throng of fiacres and omnibuses had\ngathered there. Arsene Lupin looked out. Another prison-van had\nstopped close to the one he occupied. He moved the plate still\nfarther, put his foot on one of the spokes of the wheel and leaped\nto the ground. A coachman saw him, roared with laughter, then\ntried to raise an outcry, but his voice was lost in the noise of\nthe traffic that had commenced to move again. Moreover, Arsene\nLupin was already far away.",
        "He had run for a few steps; but, once upon the sidewalk, he turned\nand looked around; he seemed to scent the wind like a person who\nis uncertain which direction to take. Then, having decided, he\nput his hands in his pockets, and, with the careless air of an\nidle stroller, he proceeded up the boulevard. It was a warm,\nbright autumn day, and the cafes were full. He took a seat on the\nterrace of one of them. He ordered a bock and a package of\ncigarettes. He emptied his glass slowly, smoked one cigarette and\nlighted a second. Then he asked the waiter to send the proprietor\nto him. When the proprietor came, Arsene spoke to him in a voice\nloud enough to be heard by everyone:",
        "“I regret to say, monsieur, I have forgotten my pocketbook.\nPerhaps, on the strength of my name, you will be pleased to give\nme credit for a few days. I am Arsene Lupin.”",
        "The proprietor looked at him, thinking he was joking. But Arsene\nrepeated:",
        "“Lupin, prisoner at the Sante, but now a fugitive. I venture to\nassume that the name inspires you with perfect confidence in me.”",
        "And he walked away, amidst shouts of laughter, whilst the\nproprietor stood amazed.",
        "Lupin strolled along the rue Soufflot, and turned into the rue\nSaint Jacques. He pursued his way slowly, smoking his cigarettes\nand looking into the shop-windows. At the Boulevard de Port Royal\nhe took his bearings, discovered where he was, and then walked in\nthe direction of the rue de la Sante. The high forbidding walls\nof the prison were now before him. He pulled his hat forward to\nshape his face; then, approaching the sentinel, he asked:",
        "“It this the prison de la Sante?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“I wish to regain my cell. The van left me on the way, and I\nwould not abuse--”",
        "“Now, young man, move along--quick!” growled the sentinel.",
        "“Pardon me, but I must pass through that gate. And if you prevent\nArsene Lupin from entering the prison it will cost you dear, my\nfriend.”",
        "“Arsene Lupin! What are you talking about!”",
        "“I am sorry I haven’t a card with me,” said Arsene, fumbling in\nhis pockets.",
        "The sentinel eyed him from head to foot, in astonishment. Then,\nwithout a word, he rang a bell. The iron gate was partly opened,\nand Arsene stepped inside. Almost immediately he encountered the\nkeeper of the prison, gesticulating and feigning a violent anger.\nArsene smiled and said:",
        "“Come, monsieur, don’t play that game with me. What! they take\nthe precaution to carry me alone in the van, prepare a nice little\nobstruction, and imagine I am going to take to my heels and rejoin\nmy friends. Well, and what about the twenty agents of the Surete\nwho accompanied us on foot, in fiacres and on bicycles? No, the\narrangement did not please me. I should not have got away alive.\nTell me, monsieur, did they count on that?”",
        "He shrugged his shoulders, and added:",
        "“I beg of you, monsieur, not to worry about me. When I wish to\nescape I shall not require any assistance.”",
        "On the second day thereafter, the `Echo de France,’ which had\napparently become the official reporter of the exploits of Arsene\nLupin, it was said that he was one of its principal shareholders--\npublished a most complete account of this attempted escape. The\nexact wording of the messages exchanged between the prisoner and\nhis mysterious friend, the means by which correspondence was\nconstructed, the complicity of the police, the promenade on the\nBoulevard Saint Michel, the incident at the cafe Soufflot,\neverything was disclosed. It was known that the search of the\nrestaurant and its waiters by Inspector Dieuzy had been fruitless.\nAnd the public also learned an extraordinary thing which\ndemonstrated the infinite variety of resources that Lupin\npossessed: the prison-van, in which he was being carried, was\nprepared for the occasion and substituted by his accomplices for\none of the six vans which did service at the prison.",
        "The next escape of Arsene Lupin was not doubted by anyone. He\nannounced it himself, in categorical terms, in a reply to Mon.\nBouvier on the day following his attempted escape. The judge\nhaving made a jest about the affair, Arsene was annoyed, and,\nfirmly eyeing the judge, he said, emphatically:",
        "“Listen to me, monsieur! I give you my word of honor that this\nattempted flight was simply preliminary to my general plan of\nescape.”",
        "“I do not understand,” said the judge.",
        "“It is not necessary that you should understand.”",
        "And when the judge, in the course of that examination which was\nreported at length in the columns of the `Echo de France,’ when\nthe judge sought to resume his investigation, Arsene Lupin\nexclaimed, with an assumed air of lassitude:",
        "“Mon Dieu, Mon Dieu, what’s the use! All these questions are of\nno importance!”",
        "“What! No importance?” cried the judge.",
        "“No; because I shall not be present at the trial.”",
        "“You will not be present?”",
        "“No; I have fully decided on that, and nothing will change my\nmind.”",
        "Such assurance combined with the inexplicable indiscretions that\nArsene committed every day served to annoy and mystify the\nofficers of the law. There were secrets known only to Arsene\nLupin; secrets that he alone could divulge. But for what purpose\ndid he reveal them? And how?",
        "Arsene Lupin was changed to another cell. The judge closed his\npreliminary investigation. No further proceedings were taken in\nhis case for a period of two months, during which time Arsene was\nseen almost constantly lying on his bed with his face turned\ntoward the wall. The changing of his cell seemed to discourage\nhim. He refused to see his advocate. He exchanged only a few\nnecessary words with his keepers.",
        "During the fortnight preceding his trial, he resumed his vigorous\nlife. He complained of want of air. Consequently, early every\nmorning he was allowed to exercise in the courtyard, guarded by\ntwo men.",
        "Public curiosity had not died out; every day it expected to be\nregaled with news of his escape; and, it is true, he had gained a\nconsiderable amount of public sympathy by reason of his verve, his\ngayety, his diversity, his inventive genius and the mystery of his\nlife. Arsene Lupin must escape. It was his inevitable fate. The\npublic expected it, and was surprised that the event had been\ndelayed so long. Every morning the Prefect of Police asked his\nsecretary:",
        "“Well, has he escaped yet?”",
        "“No, Monsieur le Prefect.”",
        "“To-morrow, probably.”",
        "And, on the day before the trial, a gentleman called at the office\nof the `Grand Journal,’ asked to see the court reporter, threw his\ncard in the reporter’s face, and walked rapidly away. These words\nwere written on the card: “Arsene Lupin always keeps his\npromises.”",
        "It was under these conditions that the trial commenced. An\nenormous crowd gathered at the court. Everybody wished to see the\nfamous Arsene Lupin. They had a gleeful anticipation that the\nprisoner would play some audacious pranks upon the judge.\nAdvocates and magistrates, reporters and men of the world,\nactresses and society women were crowded together on the benches\nprovided for the public.",
        "It was a dark, sombre day, with a steady downpour of rain. Only a\ndim light pervaded the courtroom, and the spectators caught a very\nindistinct view of the prisoner when the guards brought him in.\nBut his heavy, shambling walk, the manner in which he dropped into\nhis seat, and his passive, stupid appearance were not at all\nprepossessing. Several times his advocate--one of Mon. Danval’s\nassistants--spoke to him, but he simply shook his head and said\nnothing.",
        "The clerk read the indictment, then the judge spoke:",
        "“Prisoner at the bar, stand up. Your name, age, and occupation?”",
        "Not receiving any reply, the judge repeated:",
        "“Your name? I ask you your name?”",
        "A thick, slow voice muttered:",
        "“Baudru, Desire.”",
        "A murmur of surprise pervaded the courtroom. But the judge\nproceeded:",
        "“Baudru, Desire? Ah! a new alias! Well, as you have already\nassumed a dozen different names and this one is, no doubt, as\nimaginary as the others, we will adhere to the name of Arsene\nLupin, by which you are more generally known.”",
        "The judge referred to his notes, and continued:",
        "“For, despite the most diligent search, your past history remains\nunknown. Your case is unique in the annals of crime. We know not\nwhom you are, whence you came, your birth and breeding--all is a\nmystery to us. Three years ago you appeared in our midst as\nArsene Lupin, presenting to us a strange combination of\nintelligence and perversion, immorality and generosity.\nOur knowledge of your life prior to that date is vague and\nproblematical. It may be that the man called Rostat who, eight\nyears ago, worked with Dickson, the prestidigitator, was none\nother than Arsene Lupin. It is probably that the Russian student\nwho, six years ago, attended the laboratory of Doctor Altier at\nthe Saint Louis Hospital, and who often astonished the doctor by\nhis ingenuity of his hypotheses on subjects of bacteriology and\nthe boldness of his experiments in diseases of the skin, was none\nother than Arsene Lupin. It is probable, also, that Arsene Lupin\nwas the professor who introduced the Japanese art of jiu-jitsu to\nthe Parisian public. We have some reason to believe that Arsene\nLupin was the bicyclist who won the Grand Prix de l’Exposition,\nreceived his ten thousand francs, and was never heard of again.\nArsene Lupin may have been, also, the person who saved so many\nlives through the little dormer-window at the Charity Bazaar;\nand, at the same time, picked their pockets.”",
        "The judge paused for a moment, then continued:",
        "“Such is that epoch which seems to have been utilized by you in a\nthorough preparation for the warfare you have since waged against\nsociety; a methodical apprenticeship in which you developed your\nstrength, energy and skill to the highest point possible. Do you\nacknowledge the accuracy of these facts?”",
        "During this discourse the prisoner had stood balancing himself,\nfirst on one foot, then on the other, with shoulders stooped and\narms inert. Under the strongest light one could observe his\nextreme thinness, his hollow cheeks, his projecting cheek-bones,\nhis earthen-colored face dotted with small red spots and framed in\na rough, straggling beard. Prison life had caused him to age and\nwither. He had lost the youthful face and elegant figure we had\nseen portrayed so often in the newspapers.",
        "It appeared as if he had not heard the question propounded by the\njudge. Twice it was repeated to him. Then he raised his eyes,\nseemed to reflect, then, making a desperate effort, he murmured:",
        "“Baudru, Desire.”",
        "The judge smiled, as he said:",
        "“I do not understand the theory of your defense, Arsene Lupin. If\nyou are seeking to avoid responsibility for your crimes on the\nground of imbecility, such a line of defense is open to you. But\nI shall proceed with the trial and pay no heed to your vagaries.”",
        "He then narrated at length the various thefts, swindles and\nforgeries charged against Lupin. Sometimes he questioned the\nprisoner, but the latter simply grunted or remained silent. The\nexamination of witnesses commenced. Some of the evidence given\nwas immaterial; other portions of it seemed more important, but\nthrough all of it there ran a vein of contradictions and\ninconsistencies. A wearisome obscurity enveloped the proceedings,\nuntil Detective Ganimard was called as a witness; then interest\nwas revived.",
        "From the beginning the actions of the veteran detective appeared\nstrange and unaccountable. He was nervous and ill at ease.\nSeveral times he looked at the prisoner, with obvious doubt and\nanxiety. Then, with his hands resting on the rail in front of\nhim, he recounted the events in which he had participated,\nincluding his pursuit of the prisoner across Europe and his\narrival in America. He was listened to with great avidity, as his\ncapture of Arsene Lupin was well known to everyone through the\nmedium of the press. Toward the close of his testimony, after\nreferring to his conversations with Arsene Lupin, he stopped,\ntwice, embarrassed and undecided. It was apparent that he was\npossessed of some thought which he feared to utter. The judge\nsaid to him, sympathetically:",
        "“If you are ill, you may retire for the present.”",
        "“No, no, but---”",
        "He stopped, looked sharply at the prisoner, and said:",
        "“I ask permission to scrutinize the prisoner at closer range.\nThere is some mystery about him that I must solve.”",
        "He approached the accused man, examined him attentively for\nseveral minutes, then returned to the witness-stand, and, in an\nalmost solemn voice, he said:",
        "“I declare, on oath, that the prisoner now before me is not Arsene\nLupin.”",
        "A profound silence followed the statement. The judge, nonplused\nfor a moment, exclaimed:",
        "“Ah! What do you mean? That is absurd!”",
        "The detective continued:",
        "“At first sight there is a certain resemblance, but if you\ncarefully consider the nose, the mouth, the hair, the color of\nskin, you will see that it is not Arsene Lupin. And the eyes!\nDid he ever have those alcoholic eyes!”",
        "“Come, come, witness! What do you mean? Do you pretend to say\nthat we are trying the wrong man?”",
        "“In my opinion, yes. Arsene Lupin has, in some manner, contrived\nto put this poor devil in his place, unless this man is a willing\naccomplice.”",
        "This dramatic denouement caused much laughter and excitement\namongst the spectators. The judge adjourned the trial, and sent\nfor Mon. Bouvier, the gaoler, and guards employed in the prison.",
        "When the trial was resumed, Mon. Bouvier and the gaoler examined\nthe accused and declared that there was only a very slight\nresemblance between the prisoner and Arsene Lupin.",
        "“Well, then!” exclaimed the judge, “who is this man? Where does\nhe come from? What is he in prison for?”",
        "Two of the prison-guards were called and both of them declared\nthat the prisoner was Arsene Lupin. The judged breathed once\nmore.",
        "But one of the guards then said:",
        "“Yes, yes, I think it is he.”",
        "“What!” cried the judge, impatiently, “you think it is he! What\ndo you mean by that?”",
        "“Well, I saw very little of the prisoner. He was placed in my\ncharge in the evening and, for two months, he seldom stirred, but\nlaid on his bed with his face to the wall.”",
        "“What about the time prior to those two months?”",
        "“Before that he occupied a cell in another part of the prison. He\nwas not in cell 24.”",
        "Here the head gaoler interrupted, and said:",
        "“We changed him to another cell after his attempted escape.”",
        "“But you, monsieur, you have seen him during those two months?”",
        "“I had no occasion to see him. He was always quiet and orderly.”",
        "“And this prisoner is not Arsene Lupin?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Then who is he?” demanded the judge.",
        "“I do not know.”",
        "“Then we have before us a man who was substituted for Arsene\nLupin, two months ago. How do you explain that?”",
        "“I cannot.”",
        "In absolute despair, the judge turned to the accused and addressed\nhim in a conciliatory tone:",
        "“Prisoner, can you tell me how, and since when, you became an\ninmate of the Prison de la Sante?”",
        "The engaging manner of the judge was calculated to disarm the\nmistrust and awaken the understanding of the accused man. He\ntried to reply. Finally, under clever and gentle questioning, he\nsucceeded in framing a few phrases from which the following story\nwas gleaned: Two months ago he had been taken to the Depot,\nexamined and released. As he was leaving the building, a free\nman, he was seized by two guards and placed in the prison-van.\nSince then he had occupied cell 24. He was contented there,\nplenty to eat, and he slept well--so he did not complain.",
        "All that seemed probable; and, amidst the mirth and excitement of\nthe spectators, the judge adjourned the trial until the story\ncould be investigated and verified.",
        "The following facts were at once established by an examination of\nthe prison records: Eight weeks before a man named Baudru Desire\nhad slept at the Depot. He was released the next day, and left\nthe Depot at two o’clock in the afternoon. On the same day at two\no’clock, having been examined for the last time, Arsene Lupin left\nthe Depot in a prison-van.",
        "Had the guards made a mistake? Had then been deceived by the\nresemblance and carelessly substituted this man for their\nprisoner?",
        "Another question suggested itself: Had the substitution been\narranged in advance? In that event Baudru must have been an\naccomplice and must have caused his own arrest for the express\npurpose of taking Lupin’s place. But then, by what miracle had\nsuch a plan, based on a series of improbable chances, been carried\nto success?",
        "Baudru Desire was turned over to the anthropological service; they\nhad never seen anything like him. However, they easily traced his\npast history. He was known at Courbevois, at Asnieres and at\nLevallois. He lived on alms and slept in one of those rag-picker’s\nhuts near the barrier de Ternes. He had disappeared from there a\nyear ago.",
        "Had he been enticed away by Arsene Lupin? There was no evidence to\nthat effect. And even if that was so, it did not explain the\nflight of the prisoner. That still remained a mystery. Amongst\ntwenty theories which sought to explain it, not one was\nsatisfactory. Of the escape itself, there was no doubt; an escape\nthat was incomprehensible, sensational, in which the public, as\nwell as the officers of the law, could detect a carefully prepared\nplan, a combination of circumstances marvelously dove-tailed,\nwhereof the denouement fully justified the confident prediction of\nArsene Lupin: “I shall not be present at my trial.”",
        "After a month of patient investigation, the problem remained\nunsolved. The poor devil of a Baudru could not be kept in prison\nindefinitely, and to place him on trial would be ridiculous. There\nwas no charge against him. Consequently, he was released; but the\nchief of the Surete resolved to keep him under surveillance. This\nidea originated with Ganimard. From his point of view there was\nneither complicity nor chance. Baudru was an instrument upon which\nArsene Lupin had played with his extraordinary skill. Baudru, when\nset at liberty, would lead them to Arsene Lupin or, at least, to\nsome of his accomplices. The two inspectors, Folenfant and Dieuzy,\nwere assigned to assist Ganimard.",
        "One foggy morning in January the prison gates opened and Baudru\nDesire stepped forth--a free man. At first he appeared to be quite\nembarrassed, and walked like a person who has no precise idea\nwhither he is going. He followed the rue de la Sante and the rue\nSaint Jacques. He stopped in front of an old-clothes shop, removed\nhis jacket and his vest, sold his vest on which he realized a few\nsous; then, replacing his jacket, he proceeded on his way. He\ncrossed the Seine. At the Chatelet an omnibus passed him. He\nwished to enter it, but there was no place. The controller advised\nhim to secure a number, so he entered the waiting-room.",
        "Ganimard called to his two assistants, and, without removing his\neyes from the waiting room, he said to them:",
        "“Stop a carriage....no, two. That will be better. I will go with\none of you, and we will follow him.”",
        "The men obeyed. Yet Baudru did not appear. Ganimard entered the\nwaiting-room. It was empty.",
        "“Idiot that I am!” he muttered, “I forgot there was another exit.”",
        "There was an interior corridor extending from the waiting-room to\nthe rue Saint Martin. Ganimard rushed through it and arrived just\nin time to observe Baudru upon the top of the Batignolles-Jardin de\nPlates omnibus as it was turning the corner of the rue de Rivoli.\nHe ran and caught the omnibus. But he had lost his two assistants.\nHe must continue the pursuit alone. In his anger he was inclined\nto seize the man by the collar without ceremony. Was it not with\npremeditation and by means of an ingenious ruse that his pretended\nimbecile had separated him from his assistants?",
        "He looked at Baudru. The latter was asleep on the bench, his head\nrolling from side to side, his mouth half-opened, and an incredible\nexpression of stupidity on his blotched face. No, such an\nadversary was incapable of deceiving old Ganimard. It was a stroke\nof luck--nothing more.",
        "At the Galleries-Lafayette, the man leaped from the omnibus and\ntook the La Muette tramway, following the boulevard Haussmann and\nthe avenue Victor Hugo. Baudru alighted at La Muette station; and,\nwith a nonchalant air, strolled into the Bois de Boulogne.",
        "He wandered through one path after another, and sometimes retraced\nhis steps. What was he seeking? Had he any definite object? At\nthe end of an hour, he appeared to be faint from fatigue, and,\nnoticing a bench, he sat down. The spot, not far from Auteuil, on\nthe edge of a pond hidden amongst the trees, was absolutely\ndeserted. After the lapse of another half-hour, Ganimard became\nimpatient and resolved to speak to the man. He approached and took\na seat beside Baudru, lighted a cigarette, traced some figures in\nthe sand with the end of his cane, and said:",
        "“It’s a pleasant day.”",
        "No response. But, suddenly the man burst into laughter, a happy,\nmirthful laugh, spontaneous and irresistible. Ganimard felt his\nhair stand on end in horror and surprise. It was that laugh, that\ninfernal laugh he knew so well!",
        "With a sudden movement, he seized the man by the collar and looked\nat him with a keen, penetrating gaze; and found that he no longer\nsaw the man Baudru. To be sure, he saw Baudru; but, at the same\ntime, he saw the other, the real man, Lupin. He discovered the\nintense life in the eyes, he filled up the shrunken features, he\nperceived the real flesh beneath the flabby skin, the real mouth\nthrough the grimaces that deformed it. Those were the eyes and\nmouth of the other, and especially his keen, alert, mocking\nexpression, so clear and youthful!",
        "“Arsene Lupin, Arsene Lupin,” he stammered.",
        "Then, in a sudden fit of rage, he seized Lupin by the throat and\ntried to hold him down. In spite of his fifty years, he still\npossessed unusual strength, whilst his adversary was apparently in\na weak condition. But the struggle was a brief one. Arsene Lupin\nmade only a slight movement, and, as suddenly as he had made the\nattack, Ganimard released his hold. His right arm fell inert,\nuseless.",
        "“If you had taken lessons in jiu-jitsu at the quai des Orfevres,\"\nsaid Lupin, “you would know that that blow is called udi-shi-ghi in\nJapanese. A second more, and I would have broken your arm and that\nwould have been just what you deserve. I am surprised that you, an\nold friend whom I respect and before whom I voluntarily expose my\nincognito, should abuse my confidence in that violent manner. It\nis unworthy--Ah! What’s the matter?”",
        "Ganimard did not reply. That escape for which he deemed himself\nresponsible--was it not he, Ganimard, who, by his sensational\nevidence, had led the court into serious error? That escape\nappeared to him like a dark cloud on his professional career. A\ntear rolled down his cheek to his gray moustache.",
        "“Oh! mon Dieu, Ganimard, don’t take it to heart. If you had not\nspoken, I would have arranged for some one else to do it. I\ncouldn’t allow poor Baudru Desire to be convicted.”",
        "“Then,” murmured Ganimard, “it was you that was there? And now you\nare here?”",
        "“It is I, always I, only I.”",
        "“Can it be possible?”",
        "“Oh, it is not the work of a sorcerer. Simply, as the judge\nremarked at the trial, the apprenticeship of a dozen years that\nequips a man to cope successfully with all the obstacles in life.”",
        "“But your face? Your eyes?”",
        "“You can understand that if I worked eighteen months with Doctor\nAltier at the Saint-Louis hospital, it was not out of love for the\nwork. I considered that he, who would one day have the honor of\ncalling himself Arsene Lupin, ought to be exempt from the ordinary\nlaws governing appearance and identity. Appearance? That can be\nmodified at will. For instance, a hypodermic injection of\nparaffine will puff up the skin at the desired spot. Pyrogallic\nacid will change your skin to that of an Indian. The juice of the\ngreater celandine will adorn you with the most beautiful eruptions\nand tumors. Another chemical affects the growth of your beard and\nhair; another changes the tone of your voice. Add to that two\nmonths of dieting in cell 24; exercises repeated a thousand times\nto enable me to hold my features in a certain grimace, to carry my\nhead at a certain inclination, and adapt my back and shoulders to a\nstopping posture. Then five drops of atropine in the eyes to make\nthem haggard and wild, and the trick is done.”",
        "“I do not understand how you deceived the guards.”",
        "“The change was progressive. The evolution was so gradual that\nthey failed to notice it.”",
        "“But Baudru Desire?\"\n\"Baudru exists. He is a poor, harmless fellow whom I met last\nyear; and, really, he bears a certain resemblance to me.\nConsidering my arrest as a possible event, I took charge of Baudru\nand studied the points wherein we differed in appearance with a\nview to correct them in my own person. My friends caused him to\nremain at the Depot overnight, and to leave there next day about\nthe same hour as I did--a coincidence easily arranged. Of course,\nit was necessary to have a record of his detention at the Depot in\norder to establish the fact that such a person was a reality;\notherwise, the police would have sought elsewhere to find out my\nidentity. But, in offering to them this excellent Baudru, it was\ninevitable, you understand, inevitable that they would seize\nupon him, and, despite the insurmountable difficulties of a\nsubstitution, they would prefer to believe in a substitution than\nconfess their ignorance.”",
        "“Yes, yes, of course,” said Ganimard.",
        "“And then,” exclaimed Arsene Lupin, “I held in my hands a trump-\ncard: an anxious public watching and waiting for my escape. And\nthat is the fatal error into which you fell, you and the others, in\nthe course of that fascinating game pending between me and the\nofficers of the law wherein the stake was my liberty. And you\nsupposed that I was playing to the gallery; that I was intoxicated\nwith my success. I, Arsene Lupin, guilty of such weakness! Oh,\nno! And, no longer ago than the Cahorn affair, you said: “When\nArsene Lupin cries from the housetops that he will escape, he has\nsome object in view.” But, sapristi, you must understand that in\norder to escape I must create, in advance, a public belief that\nescape, a belief amounting to an article of faith, an absolute\nconviction, a reality as glittering as the sun. And I did create\nthat belief that Arsene Lupin would escape, that Arsene Lupin would\nnot be present at his trial. And when you gave your evidence and\nsaid: “That man is not Arsene Lupin,” everybody was prepared to\nbelieve you. Had one person doubted it, had any one uttered this\nsimple restriction: Suppose it is Arsene Lupin?--from that moment, I\nwas lost. If anyone had scrutinized my face, not imbued with the\nidea that I was not Arsene Lupin, as you and the others did at my\ntrial, but with the idea that I might be Arsene Lupin; then,\ndespite all my precautions, I should have been recognized. But I\nhad no fear. Logically, psychologically, no once could entertain\nthe idea that I was Arsene Lupin.”",
        "He grasped Ganimard’s hand.",
        "“Come, Ganimard, confess that on the Wednesday after our\nconversation in the prison de la Sante, you expected me at your\nhouse at four o’clock, exactly as I said I would go.”",
        "“And your prison-van?” said Ganimard, evading the question.",
        "“A bluff! Some of my friends secured that old unused van and wished\nto make the attempt. But I considered it impractical without the\nconcurrence of a number of unusual circumstances. However, I found\nit useful to carry out that attempted escape and give it the widest\npublicity. An audaciously planned escape, though not completed,\ngave to the succeeding one the character of reality simply by\nanticipation.”",
        "“So that the cigar....”",
        "“Hollowed by myself, as well as the knife.”",
        "“And the letters?”",
        "“Written by me.”",
        "“And the mysterious correspondent?”",
        "“Did not exist.”",
        "Ganimard reflected a moment, then said:",
        "“When the anthropological service had Baudru’s case under\nconsideration, why did they not perceive that his measurements\ncoincided with those of Arsene Lupin?”",
        "“My measurements are not in existence.”",
        "“Indeed!”",
        "“At least, they are false. I have given considerable attention to\nthat question. In the first place, the Bertillon system of records\nthe visible marks of identification--and you have seen that they are\nnot infallible--and, after that, the measurements of the head, the\nfingers, the ears, etc. Of course, such measurements are more or\nless infallible.”",
        "“Absolutely.”",
        "“No; but it costs money to get around them. Before we left\nAmerica, one of the employees of the service there accepted so much\nmoney to insert false figures in my measurements. Consequently,\nBaudru’s measurements should not agree with those of Arsene Lupin.”",
        "After a short silence, Ganimard asked:",
        "“What are you going to do now?”",
        "“Now,” replied Lupin, “I am going to take a rest, enjoy the best of\nfood and drink and gradually recover my former healthy condition.\nIt is all very well to become Baudru or some other person, on\noccasion, and to change your personality as you do your shirt, but\nyou soon grow weary of the change. I feel exactly as I imagine the\nman who lost his shadow must have felt, and I shall be glad to be\nArsene Lupin once more.”",
        "He walked to and fro for a few minutes, then, stopping in front of\nGanimard, he said:",
        "“You have nothing more to say, I suppose?”",
        "“Yes. I should like to know if you intend to reveal the true state\nof facts connected with your escape. The mistake that I made---”",
        "“Oh! no one will ever know that it was Arsene Lupin who was\ndischarged. It is to my own interest to surround myself with\nmystery, and therefore I shall permit my escape to retain its\nalmost miraculous character. So, have no fear on that score, my\ndear friend. I shall say nothing. And now, good-bye. I am going\nout to dinner this evening, and have only sufficient time to\ndress.”",
        "“I though you wanted a rest.”",
        "“Ah! there are duties to society that one cannot avoid. To-morrow,\nI shall rest.”",
        "“Where do you dine to-night?”",
        "“With the British Ambassador!”",
        "The evening before, I had sent my automobile to Rouen by the\nhighway. I was to travel to Rouen by rail, on my way to visit some\nfriends that live on the banks of the Seine.",
        "At Paris, a few minutes before the train started, seven gentlemen\nentered my compartment; five of them were smoking. No matter that\nthe journey was a short one, the thought of traveling with such a\ncompany was not agreeable to me, especially as the car was built\non the old model, without a corridor. I picked up my overcoat, my\nnewspapers and my time-table, and sought refuge in a neighboring\ncompartment.",
        "It was occupied by a lady, who, at sight of me, made a gesture of\nannoyance that did not escape my notice, and she leaned toward a\ngentleman who was standing on the step and was, no doubt, her\nhusband. The gentleman scrutinized me closely, and, apparently, my\nappearance did not displease him, for he smiled as he spoke to his\nwife with the air of one who reassures a frightened child. She\nsmiled also, and gave me a friendly glance as if she now\nunderstood that I was one of those gallant men with whom a woman\ncan remain shut up for two hours in a little box, six feet square,\nand have nothing to fear.",
        "Her husband said to her:",
        "“I have an important appointment, my dear, and cannot wait any\nlonger. Adieu.”",
        "He kissed her affectionately and went away. His wife threw him a\nfew kisses and waved her handkerchief. The whistle sounded, and\nthe train started.",
        "At that precise moment, and despite the protests of the guards,\nthe door was opened, and a man rushed into our compartment. My\ncompanion, who was standing and arranging her luggage, uttered a\ncry of terror and fell upon the seat. I am not a coward--far from\nit--but I confess that such intrusions at the last minute are\nalways disconcerting. They have a suspicious, unnatural aspect.",
        "However, the appearance of the new arrival greatly modified the\nunfavorable impression produced by his precipitant action. He was\ncorrectly and elegantly dressed, wore a tasteful cravat, correct\ngloves, and his face was refined and intelligent. But, where the\ndevil had I seen that face before? Because, beyond all possible\ndoubt, I had seen it. And yet the memory of it was so vague and\nindistinct that I felt it would be useless to try to recall it at\nthat time.",
        "Then, directing my attention to the lady, I was amazed at the\npallor and anxiety I saw in her face. She was looking at her\nneighbor--they occupied seats on the same side of the compartment--\nwith an expression of intense alarm, and I perceived that one of\nher trembling hands was slowly gliding toward a little traveling\nbag that was lying on the seat about twenty inches from her. She\nfinished by seizing it and nervously drawing it to her. Our eyes\nmet, and I read in hers so much anxiety and fear that I could not\nrefrain from speaking to her:",
        "“Are you ill, madame? Shall I open the window?”",
        "Her only reply was a gesture indicating that she was afraid of our\ncompanion. I smiled, as her husband had done, shrugged my\nshoulders, and explained to her, in pantomime, that she had\nnothing to fear, that I was there, and, besides, the gentleman\nappeared to be a very harmless individual. At that moment, he\nturned toward us, scrutinized both of us from head to foot, then\nsettled down in his corner and paid us no more attention.",
        "After a short silence, the lady, as if she had mustered all her\nenergy to perform a desperate act, said to me, in an almost\ninaudible voice:",
        "“Do you know who is on our train?”",
        "“Who?”",
        "“He....he....I assure you....”",
        "“Who is he?”",
        "“Arsene Lupin!”",
        "She had not taken her eyes off our companion, and it was to him\nrather than to me that she uttered the syllables of that\ndisquieting name. He drew his hat over his face. Was that to\nconceal his agitation or, simply, to arrange himself for sleep?\nThen I said to her:",
        "“Yesterday, through contumacy, Arsene Lupin was sentenced to\ntwenty years’ imprisonment at hard labor. Therefore it is\nimprobable that he would be so imprudent, to-day, as to show\nhimself in public. Moreover, the newspapers have announced his\nappearance in Turkey since his escape from the Sante.”",
        "“But he is on this train at the present moment,” the lady\nproclaimed, with the obvious intention of being heard by our\ncompanion; “my husband is one of the directors in the penitentiary\nservice, and it was the stationmaster himself who told us that a\nsearch was being made for Arsene Lupin.”",
        "“They may have been mistaken---”",
        "“No; he was seen in the waiting-room. He bought a first-class\nticket for Rouen.”",
        "“He has disappeared. The guard at the waiting-room door did not\nsee him pass, and it is supposed that he had got into the express\nthat leaves ten minutes after us.”",
        "“In that case, they will be sure to catch him.”",
        "“Unless, at the last moment, he leaped from that train to come\nhere, into our train....which is quite probable....which is\nalmost certain.”",
        "“If so, he will be arrested just the same; for the employees and\nguards would no doubt observe his passage from one train to the\nother, and, when we arrive at Rouen, they will arrest him there.”",
        "“Him--never! He will find some means of escape.”",
        "“In that case, I wish him ’bon voyage.’”",
        "“But, in the meantime, think what he may do!”",
        "“What?”",
        "“I don’t know. He may do anything.”",
        "She was greatly agitated, and, truly, the situation justified, to\nsome extent, her nervous excitement. I was impelled to say to her:",
        "“Of course, there are many strange coincidences, but you need have\nno fear. Admitting that Arsene Lupin is on this train, he will not\ncommit any indiscretion; he will be only too happy to escape the\nperil that already threatens him.”",
        "My words did not reassure her, but she remained silent for a time.\nI unfolded my newspapers and read reports of Arsene Lupin’s trial,\nbut, as they contained nothing that was new to me, I was not\ngreatly interested. Moreover, I was tired and sleepy. I felt my\neyelids close and my head drop.",
        "“But, monsieur, you are not going to sleep!”",
        "She seized my newspaper, and looked at me with indignation.",
        "“Certainly not,” I said.",
        "“That would be very imprudent.”",
        "“Of course,” I assented.",
        "I struggled to keep awake. I looked through the window at the\nlandscape and the fleeting clouds, but in a short time all that\nbecame confused and indistinct; the image of the nervous lady and\nthe drowsy gentleman were effaced from my memory, and I was buried\nin the soothing depths of a profound sleep. The tranquility of my\nresponse was soon disturbed by disquieting dreams, wherein a\ncreature that had played the part and bore the name of Arsene\nLupin held an important place. He appeared to me with his black\nladen with articles of value; he leaped over walls, and plundered\ncastles. But the outlines of that creature, who was no longer\nArsene Lupin, assumed a more definite form. He came toward me,\ngrowing larger and larger, leaped into the compartment with\nincredible agility, and landed squarely on my chest. With a cry of\nfright and pain, I awoke. The man, the traveller, our companion,\nwith his knee on my breast, held me by the throat.",
        "My sight was very indistinct, for my eyes were suffused with\nblood. I could see the lady, in a corner of the compartment,\nconvulsed with fright. I tried even not to resist. Besides, I did\nnot have the strength. My temples throbbed; I was almost\nstrangled. One minute more, and I would have breathed my last. The\nman must have realized it, for he relaxed his grip, but did not\nremove his had. Then he took a cord, in which he had prepared a\nslip-knot, and tied my wrists together. In an instant, I was\nbound, gagged, and helpless.",
        "Certainly, he accomplished the trick with an ease and skill that\nrevealed the hand of a master; he was, no doubt, a professional\nthief. Not a word, not a nervous movement; only coolness and\naudacity. And I was there, lying on the bench, bound like a mummy,\nI--Arsene Lupin!",
        "It was anything but a laughing matter, and yet, despite the\ngravity of the situation, I keenly appreciated the humor and irony\nthat it involved. Arsene Lupin seized and bound like a novice!\nrobbed as if I were an unsophisticated rustic--for, you must\nunderstand, the scoundrel had deprived me of my purse and wallet!\nArsene Lupin, a victim, duped, vanquished....What an adventure!",
        "The lady did not move. He did not even notice her. He contented\nhimself with picking up her traveling-bag that had fallen to the\nfloor and taking from it the jewels, purse, and gold and silver\ntrinkets that it contained. The lady opened her eyes, trembled\nwith fear, drew the rings from her fingers and handed them to the\nman as if she wished to spare him unnecessary trouble. He took the\nrings and looked at her. She swooned.",
        "Then, quite unruffled, he resumed his seat, lighted a cigarette,\nand proceeded to examine the treasure that he had acquired. The\nexamination appeared to give him perfect satisfaction.",
        "But I was not so well satisfied. I do not speak of the twelve\nthousand francs of which I had been unduly deprived: that was only\na temporary loss, because I was certain that I would recover\npossession of that money after a very brief delay, together with\nthe important papers contained in my wallet: plans, specifications,\naddresses, lists of correspondents, and compromising letters.\nBut, for the moment, a more immediate and more serious question\ntroubled me: How would this affair end? What would be the outcome\nof this adventure?",
        "As you can imagine, the disturbance created by my passage through\nthe Saint-Lazare station has not escaped my notice. Going to visit\nfriends who knew me under the name of Guillaume Berlat, and\namongst whom my resemblance to Arsene Lupin was a subject of many\ninnocent jests, I could not assume a disguise, and my presence had\nbeen remarked. So, beyond question, the commissary of police at\nRouen, notified by telegraph, and assisted by numerous agents,\nwould be awaiting the train, would question all suspicious\npassengers, and proceed to search the cars.",
        "Of course, I had foreseen all that, but it had not disturbed me,\nas I was certain that the police of Rouen would not be any\nshrewder than the police of Paris and that I could escape\nrecognition; would it not be sufficient for me to carelessly\ndisplay my card as “depute,” thanks to which I had inspired\ncomplete confidence in the gate-keeper at Saint-Lazare?--But the\nsituation was greatly changed. I was no longer free. It was\nimpossible to attempt one of my usual tricks. In one of the\ncompartments, the commissary of police would find Mon. Arsene\nLupin, bound hand and foot, as docile as a lamb, packed up, all\nready to be dumped into a prison-van. He would have simply to\naccept delivery of the parcel, the same as if it were so much\nmerchandise or a basket of fruit and vegetables. Yet, to avoid\nthat shameful denouement, what could I do?--bound and gagged, as I\nwas? And the train was rushing on toward Rouen, the next and only\nstation.",
        "Another problem was presented, in which I was less interested, but\nthe solution of which aroused my professional curiosity. What were\nthe intentions of my rascally companion? Of course, if I had been\nalone, he could, on our arrival at Rouen, leave the car slowly and\nfearlessly. But the lady? As soon as the door of the compartment\nshould be opened, the lady, now so quiet and humble, would scream\nand call for help. That was the dilemma that perplexed me! Why had\nhe not reduced her to a helpless condition similar to mine? That\nwould have given him ample time to disappear before his double\ncrime was discovered.",
        "He was still smoking, with his eyes fixed upon the window that was\nnow being streaked with drops of rain. Once he turned, picked up\nmy time-table, and consulted it.",
        "The lady had to feign a continued lack of consciousness in order\nto deceive the enemy. But fits of coughing, provoked by the smoke,\nexposed her true condition. As to me, I was very uncomfortable,\nand very tired. And I meditated; I plotted.",
        "The train was rushing on, joyously, intoxicated with its own\nspeed.",
        "Saint Etienne!....At that moment, the man arose and took two steps\ntoward us, which caused the lady to utter a cry of alarm and fall\ninto a genuine swoon. What was the man about to do? He lowered the\nwindow on our side. A heavy rain was now falling, and, by a\ngesture, the man expressed his annoyance at his not having an\numbrella or an overcoat. He glanced at the rack. The lady’s\numbrella was there. He took it. He also took my overcoat and put\nit on.",
        "We were now crossing the Seine. He turned up the bottoms of his\ntrousers, then leaned over and raised the exterior latch of the\ndoor. Was he going to throw himself upon the track? At that speed,\nit would have been instant death. We now entered a tunnel. The man\nopened the door half-way and stood on the upper step. What folly!\nThe darkness, the smoke, the noise, all gave a fantastic\nappearance to his actions. But suddenly, the train diminished its\nspeed. A moment later it increased its speed, then slowed up\nagain. Probably, some repairs were being made in that part of the\ntunnel which obliged the trains to diminish their speed, and the\nman was aware of the fact. He immediately stepped down to the\nlower step, closed the door behind him, and leaped to the ground.\nHe was gone.",
        "The lady immediately recovered her wits, and her first act was to\nlament the loss of her jewels. I gave her an imploring look. She\nunderstood, and quickly removed the gag that stifled me. She\nwished to untie the cords that bound me, but I prevented her.",
        "“No, no, the police must see everything exactly as it stands. I\nwant them to see what the rascal did to us.”",
        "“Suppose I pull the alarm-bell?”",
        "“Too late. You should have done that when he made the attack on\nme.”",
        "“But he would have killed me. Ah! monsieur, didn’t I tell you that\nhe was on this train. I recognized him from his portrait. And now\nhe has gone off with my jewels.”",
        "“Don’t worry. The police will catch him.”",
        "“Catch Arsene Lupin! Never.”",
        "“That depends on you, madame. Listen. When we arrive at Rouen, be\nat the door and call. Make a noise. The police and the railway\nemployees will come. Tell what you have seen: the assault made on\nme and the flight of Arsene Lupin. Give a description of him--soft\nhat, umbrella--yours--gray overcoat....”",
        "“Yours,” said she.",
        "“What! mine? Not at all. It was his. I didn’t have any.”",
        "“It seems to me he didn’t have one when he came in.”",
        "“Yes, yes....unless the coat was one that some one had forgotten\nand left in the rack. At all events, he had it when he went away,\nand that is the essential point. A gray overcoat--remember!....Ah!\nI forgot. You must tell your name, first thing you do. Your\nhusband’s official position will stimulate the zeal of the\npolice.”",
        "We arrived at the station. I gave her some further instructions in\na rather imperious tone:",
        "“Tell them my name--Guillaume Berlat. If necessary, say that you\nknow me. That will save time. We must expedite the preliminary\ninvestigation. The important thing is the pursuit of Arsene Lupin.\nYour jewels, remember! Let there be no mistake. Guillaume Berlat,\na friend of your husband.”",
        "“I understand....Guillaume Berlat.”",
        "She was already calling and gesticulating. As soon as the train\nstopped, several men entered the compartment. The critical moment\nhad come.",
        "Panting for breath, the lady exclaimed:",
        "“Arsene Lupin....he attacked us....he stole my jewels....I am\nMadame Renaud....my husband is a director of the penitentiary\nservice....Ah! here is my brother, Georges Ardelle, director of\nthe Credit Rouennais....you must know....”",
        "She embraced a young man who had just joined us, and whom the\ncommissary saluted. Then she continued, weeping:",
        "“Yes, Arsene Lupin....while monsieur was sleeping, he seized him\nby the throat....Mon. Berlat, a friend of my husband.”",
        "The commissary asked:",
        "“But where is Arsene Lupin?”",
        "“He leaped from the train, when passing through the tunnel.”",
        "“Are you sure that it was he?”",
        "“Am I sure! I recognized him perfectly. Besides, he was seen at\nthe Saint-Lazare station. He wore a soft hat---”",
        "“No, a hard felt, like that,” said the commissary, pointing to my\nhat.",
        "“He had a soft hat, I am sure,” repeated Madame Renaud, “and a\ngray overcoat.”",
        "“Yes, that is right,” replied the commissary, “the telegram says\nhe wore a gray overcoat with a black velvet collar.”",
        "“Exactly, a black velvet collar,” exclaimed Madame Renaud,\ntriumphantly.",
        "I breathed freely. Ah! the excellent friend I had in that little\nwoman.",
        "The police agents had now released me. I bit my lips until they\nran blood. Stooping over, with my handkerchief over my mouth, an\nattitude quite natural in a person who has remained for a long\ntime in an uncomfortable position, and whose mouth shows the\nbloody marks of the gag, I addressed the commissary, in a weak\nvoice:",
        "“Monsieur, it was Arsene Lupin. There is no doubt about that. If\nwe make haste, he can be caught yet. I think I may be of some\nservice to you.”",
        "The railway car, in which the crime occurred, was detached from\nthe train to serve as a mute witness at the official investigation.\nThe train continued on its way to Havre. We were then conducted to\nthe station-master’s office through a crowd of curious spectators.",
        "Then, I had a sudden access of doubt and discretion. Under some\npretext or other, I must gain my automobile, and escape. To remain\nthere was dangerous. Something might happen; for instance, a\ntelegram from Paris, and I would be lost.",
        "Yes, but what about my thief? Abandoned to my own resources, in an\nunfamiliar country, I could not hope to catch him.",
        "“Bah! I must make the attempt,” I said to myself. “It may be a\ndifficult game, but an amusing one, and the stake is well worth\nthe trouble.”",
        "And when the commissary asked us to repeat the story of the\nrobbery, I exclaimed:",
        "“Monsieur, really, Arsene Lupin is getting the start of us. My\nautomobile is waiting in the courtyard. If you will be so kind as\nto use it, we can try....”",
        "The commissary smiled, and replied:",
        "“The idea is a good one; so good, indeed, that it is already being\ncarried out. Two of my men have set out on bicycles. They have\nbeen gone for some time.”",
        "“Where did they go?”",
        "“To the entrance of the tunnel. There, they will gather evidence,\nsecure witnesses, and follow on the track of Arsene Lupin.”",
        "I could not refrain from shrugging my shoulders, as I replied:",
        "“Your men will not secure any evidence or any witnesses.”",
        "“Really!”",
        "“Arsene Lupin will not allow anyone to see him emerge from the\ntunnel. He will take the first road---”",
        "“To Rouen, where we will arrest him.”",
        "“He will not go to Rouen.”",
        "“Then he will remain in the vicinity, where his capture will be\neven more certain.”",
        "“He will not remain in the vicinity.”",
        "“Oh! oh! And where will he hide?”",
        "I looked at my watch, and said:",
        "“At the present moment, Arsene Lupin is prowling around the\nstation at Darnetal. At ten fifty, that is, in twenty-two minutes\nfrom now, he will take the train that goes from Rouen to Amiens.”",
        "“Do you think so? How do you know it?”",
        "“Oh! it is quite simple. While we were in the car, Arsene Lupin\nconsulted my railway guide. Why did he do it? Was there, not far\nfrom the spot where he disappeared, another line of railway, a\nstation upon that line, and a train stopping at that station? On\nconsulting my railway guide, I found such to be the case.”",
        "“Really, monsieur,” said the commissary, “that is a marvelous\ndeduction. I congratulate you on your skill.”",
        "I was now convinced that I had made a mistake in displaying so\nmuch cleverness. The commissary regarded me with astonishment, and\nI though a slight suspicion entered his official mind....Oh!\nscarcely that, for the photographs distributed broadcast by the\npolice department were too imperfect; they presented an Arsene\nLupin so different from the one he had before him, that he could\nnot possibly recognize me by it. But, all the same, he was\ntroubled, confused and ill-at-ease.",
        "“Mon Dieu! nothing stimulates the comprehension so much as the\nloss of a pocketbook and the desire to recover it. And it seems to\nme that if you will give me two of your men, we may be able....”",
        "“Oh! I beg of you, monsieur le commissaire,” cried Madame Renaud,\n\"listen to Mon. Berlat.”",
        "The intervention of my excellent friend was decisive. Pronounced\nby her, the wife of an influential official, the name of Berlat\nbecame really my own, and gave me an identity that no mere\nsuspicion could affect. The commissary arose, and said:",
        "“Believe me, Monsieur Berlat, I shall be delighted to see you\nsucceed. I am as much interested as you are in the arrest of\nArsene Lupin.”",
        "He accompanied me to the automobile, and introduced two of his men,\nHonore Massol and Gaston Delivet, who were assigned to assist me.\nMy chauffer cranked up the car and I took my place at the wheel. A\nfew seconds later, we left the station. I was saved.",
        "Ah! I must confess that in rolling over the boulevards that\nsurrounded the old Norman city, in my swift thirty-five horse-power\nMoreau-Lepton, I experienced a deep feeling of pride, and the motor\nresponded, sympathetically to my desires. At right and left, the\ntrees flew past us with startling rapidity, and I, free, out of\ndanger, had simply to arrange my little personal affairs with the\ntwo honest representatives of the Rouen police who were sitting\nbehind me. Arsene Lupin was going in search of Arsene Lupin!",
        "Modest guardians of social order--Gaston Delivet and Honore Massol--\nhow valuable was your assistance! What would I have done without\nyou? Without you, many times, at the cross-roads, I might have\ntaken the wrong route! Without you, Arsene Lupin would have made a\nmistake, and the other would have escaped!",
        "But the end was not yet. Far from it. I had yet to capture the\nthief and recover the stolen papers. Under no circumstances must\nmy two acolytes be permitted to see those papers, much less to\nseize them. That was a point that might give me some difficulty.",
        "We arrived at Darnetal three minutes after the departure of the\ntrain. True, I had the consolation of learning that a man wearing\na gray overcoat with a black velvet collar had taken the train at\nthe station. He had bought a second-class ticket for Amiens.\nCertainly, my debut as detective was a promising one.",
        "Delivet said to me:",
        "“The train is express, and the next stop is Monterolier-Buchy in\nnineteen minutes. If we do not reach there before Arsene Lupin, he\ncan proceed to Amiens, or change for the train going to Cleres,\nand, from that point, reach Dieppe or Paris.”",
        "“How far to Monterolier?”",
        "“Twenty-three kilometres.”",
        "“Twenty-three kilometres in nineteen minutes....We will be there\nahead of him.”",
        "We were off again! Never had my faithful Moreau-Repton responded\nto my impatience with such ardor and regularity. It participated\nin my anxiety. It indorsed my determination. It comprehended my\nanimosity against that rascally Arsene Lupin. The knave! The\ntraitor!",
        "“Turn to the right,” cried Delivet, “then to the left.”",
        "We fairly flew, scarcely touching the ground. The mile-stones\nlooked like little timid beasts that vanished at our approach.\nSuddenly, at a turn of the road, we saw a vortex of smoke. It was\nthe Northern Express. For a kilometre, it was a struggle, side by\nside, but an unequal struggle in which the issue was certain. We\nwon the race by twenty lengths.",
        "In three seconds we were on the platform standing before the\nsecond-class carriages. The doors were opened, and some passengers\nalighted, but not my thief. We made a search through the\ncompartments. No sign of Arsene Lupin.",
        "“Sapristi!” I cried, “he must have recognized me in the automobile\nas we were racing, side by side, and he leaped from the train.”",
        "“Ah! there he is now! crossing the track.”",
        "I started in pursuit of the man, followed by my two acolytes, or\nrather followed by one of them, for the other, Massol, proved\nhimself to be a runner of exceptional speed and endurance. In a\nfew moments, he had made an appreciable gain upon the fugitive.\nThe man noticed it, leaped over a hedge, scampered across a meadow,\nand entered a thick grove. When we reached this grove, Massol was\nwaiting for us. He went no farther, for fear of losing us.",
        "“Quite right, my dear friend,” I said. “After such a run, our\nvictim must be out of wind. We will catch him now.”",
        "I examined the surroundings with the idea of proceeding alone in\nthe arrest of the fugitive, in order to recover my papers,\nconcerning which the authorities would doubtless ask many\ndisagreeable questions. Then I returned to my companions, and\nsaid:",
        "“It is all quite easy. You, Massol, take your place at the left;\nyou, Delivet, at the right. From there, you can observe the entire\nposterior line of the bush, and he cannot escape without you seeing\nhim, except by that ravine, and I shall watch it. If he does not\ncome out voluntarily, I will enter and drive him out toward one or\nthe other of you. You have simply to wait. Ah! I forgot: in case\nI need you, a pistol shot.”",
        "Massol and Delivet walked away to their respective posts. As soon\nas they had disappeared, I entered the grove with the greatest\nprecaution so as to be neither seen nor heard. I encountered dense\nthickets, trough which narrow paths had been cut, but the\noverhanging boughs compelled me to adopt a stooping posture. One\nof these paths led to a clearing in which I found footsteps upon\nthe wet grass. I followed them; they led me to the foot of a mound\nwhich was surmounted by a deserted, dilapidated hovel.",
        "“He must be there,” I said to myself. “It is a well-chosen\nretreat.”",
        "I crept cautiously to the side of the building. A slight noise\ninformed me that he was there; and, then, through an opening, I saw\nhim. His back was turned toward me. In two bounds, I was upon\nhim. He tried to fire a revolver that he held in his hand. But he\nhad no time. I threw him to the ground, in such a manner that his\narms were beneath him, twisted and helpless, whilst I held him down\nwith my knee on his breast.",
        "“Listen, my boy,” I whispered in his ear. “I am Arsene Lupin. You\nare to deliver over to me, immediately and gracefully, my\npocketbook and the lady’s jewels, and, in return therefore, I will\nsave you from the police and enroll you amongst my friends. One\nword: yes or no?”",
        "“Yes,” he murmured.",
        "“Very good. Your escape, this morning, was well planned. I\ncongratulate you.”",
        "I arose. He fumbled in his pocket, drew out a large knife and\ntried to strike me with it.",
        "“Imbecile!” I exclaimed.",
        "With one hand, I parried the attack; with the other, I gave him a\nsharp blow on the carotid artery. He fell--stunned!",
        "In my pocketbook, I recovered my papers and bank-notes. Out of\ncuriosity, I took his. Upon an envelope, addressed to him, I read\nhis name: Pierre Onfrey. It startled me. Pierre Onfrey, the\nassassin of the rue Lafontaine at Auteuil! Pierre Onfrey, he who\nhad cut the throats of Madame Delbois and her two daughters. I\nleaned over him. Yes, those were the features which, in the\ncompartment, had evoked in me the memory of a face I could not then\nrecall.",
        "But time was passing. I placed in an envelope two bank-notes of\none hundred francs each, with a card bearing these words: “Arsene\nLupin to his worthy colleagues Honore Massol and Gaston Delivet, as\na slight token of his gratitude.” I placed it in a prominent spot\nin the room, where they would be sure to find it. Beside it, I\nplaced Madame Renaud’s handbag. Why could I not return it to the\nlady who had befriended me? I must confess that I had taken from\nit everything that possessed any interest or value, leaving there\nonly a shell comb, a stick of rouge Dorin for the lips, and an\nempty purse. But, you know, business is business. And then,\nreally, her husband is engaged in such a dishonorable vocation!",
        "The man was becoming conscious. What was I to do? I was unable to\nsave him or condemn him. So I took his revolver and fired a shot\nin the air.",
        "“My two acolytes will come and attend to his case,” I said to\nmyself, as I hastened away by the road through the ravine. Twenty\nminutes later, I was seated in my automobile.",
        "At four o’clock, I telegraphed to my friends at Rouen that an\nunexpected event would prevent me from making my promised visit.\nBetween ourselves, considering what my friends must now know, my\nvisit is postponed indefinitely. A cruel disillusion for them!",
        "At six o’clock I was in Paris. The evening newspapers informed me\nthat Pierre Onfrey had been captured at last.",
        "Next day,--let us not despise the advantages of judicious\nadvertising,--the `Echo de France’ published this sensational item:",
        "“Yesterday, near Buchy, after numerous exciting incidents, Arsene\nLupin effected the arrest of Pierre Onfrey. The assassin of the\nrue Lafontaine had robbed Madame Renaud, wife of the director in\nthe penitentiary service, in a railway carriage on the Paris-Havre\nline. Arsene Lupin restored to Madame Renaud the hand-bag that\ncontained her jewels, and gave a generous recompense to the two\ndetectives who had assisted him in making that dramatic arrest.”",
        "Two or three times each year, on occasions of unusual importance,\nsuch as the balls at the Austrian Embassy or the soirees of Lady\nBillingstone, the Countess de Dreux-Soubise wore upon her white\nshoulders “The Queen’s Necklace.”",
        "It was, indeed, the famous necklace, the legendary necklace that\nBohmer and Bassenge, court jewelers, had made for Madame Du Barry;\nthe veritable necklace that the Cardinal de Rohan-Soubise intended\nto give to Marie-Antoinette, Queen of France; and the same that the\nadventuress Jeanne de Valois, Countess de la Motte, had pulled to\npieces one evening in February, 1785, with the aid of her husband\nand their accomplice, Retaux de Villette.",
        "To tell the truth, the mounting alone was genuine. Retaux de\nVillette had kept it, whilst the Count de la Motte and his wife\nscattered to the four winds of heaven the beautiful stones so\ncarefully chosen by Bohmer. Later, he sold the mounting to Gaston\nde Dreux-Soubise, nephew and heir of the Cardinal, who re-purchased\nthe few diamonds that remained in the possession of the English\njeweler, Jeffreys; supplemented them with other stones of the same\nsize but of much inferior quality, and thus restored the marvelous\nnecklace to the form in which it had come from the hands of Bohmer\nand Bassenge.",
        "For nearly a century, the house of Dreux-Soubise had prided itself\nupon the possession of this historic jewel. Although adverse\ncircumstances had greatly reduced their fortune, they preferred to\ncurtail their household expenses rather than part with this relic\nof royalty. More particularly, the present count clung to it as a\nman clings to the home of his ancestors. As a matter of prudence,\nhe had rented a safety-deposit box at the Credit Lyonnais in which\nto keep it. He went for it himself on the afternoon of the day on\nwhich his wife wished to wear it, and he, himself, carried it back\nnext morning.",
        "On this particular evening, at the reception given at the Palais de\nCastille, the Countess achieved a remarkable success; and King\nChristian, in whose honor the fete was given, commented on her\ngrace and beauty. The thousand facets of the diamond sparkled and\nshone like flames of fire about her shapely neck and shoulders, and\nit is safe to say that none but she could have borne the weight of\nsuch an ornament with so much ease and grace.",
        "This was a double triumph, and the Count de Dreux was highly elated\nwhen they returned to their chamber in the old house of the\nfaubourg Saint-Germain. He was proud of his wife, and quite as\nproud, perhaps, of the necklace that had conferred added luster to\nhis noble house for generations. His wife, also, regarded the\nnecklace with an almost childish vanity, and it was not without\nregret that she removed it from her shoulders and handed it to her\nhusband who admired it as passionately as if he had never seen it\nbefore. Then, having placed it in its case of red leather, stamped\nwith the Cardinal’s arms, he passed into an adjoining room which\nwas simply an alcove or cabinet that had been cut off from their\nchamber, and which could be entered only by means of a door at the\nfoot of their bed. As he had done on previous occasions, he hid it\non a high shelf amongst hat-boxes and piles of linen. He closed\nthe door, and retired.",
        "Next morning, he arose about nine o’clock, intending to go to the\nCredit Lyonnais before breakfast. He dressed, drank a cup of\ncoffee, and went to the stables to give his orders. The condition\nof one of the horses worried him. He caused it to be exercised in\nhis presence. Then he returned to his wife, who had not yet left\nthe chamber. Her maid was dressing her hair. When her husband\nentered, she asked:",
        "“Are you going out?”",
        "“Yes, as far as the bank.”",
        "“Of course. That is wise.”",
        "He entered the cabinet; but, after a few seconds, and without any\nsign of astonishment, he asked:",
        "“Did you take it, my dear?”",
        "“What?....No, I have not taken anything.”",
        "“You must have moved it.”",
        "“Not at all. I have not even opened that door.”",
        "He appeared at the door, disconcerted, and stammered, in a scarcely\nintelligible voice:",
        "“You haven’t....It wasn’t you?....Then....”",
        "She hastened to his assistance, and, together, they made a thorough\nsearch, throwing the boxes to the floor and overturning the piles\nof linen. Then the count said, quite discouraged:",
        "“It is useless to look any more. I put it here, on this shelf.”",
        "“You must be mistaken.”",
        "“No, no, it was on this shelf--nowhere else.”",
        "They lighted a candle, as the room was quite dark, and then carried\nout all the linen and other articles that the room contained. And,\nwhen the room was emptied, they confessed, in despair, that the\nfamous necklace had disappeared. Without losing time in vain\nlamentations, the countess notified the commissary of police, Mon.\nValorbe, who came at once, and, after hearing their story, inquired\nof the count:",
        "“Are you sure that no one passed through your chamber during the\nnight?”",
        "“Absolutely sure, as I am a very light sleeper. Besides, the\nchamber door was bolted, and I remember unbolting it this morning\nwhen my wife rang for her maid.”",
        "“And there is no other entrance to the cabinet?”",
        "“None.”",
        "“No windows?”",
        "“Yes, but it is closed up.”",
        "“I will look at it.”",
        "Candles were lighted, and Mon. Valorbe observed at once that the\nlower half of the window was covered by a large press which was,\nhowever, so narrow that it did not touch the casement on either\nside.",
        "“On what does this window open?”",
        "“A small inner court.”",
        "“And you have a floor above this?”",
        "“Two; but, on a level with the servant’s floor, there is a close\ngrating over the court. That is why this room is so dark.”",
        "When the press was moved, they found that the window was fastened,\nwhich would not have been the case if anyone had entered that way.",
        "“Unless,” said the count, “they went out through our chamber.”",
        "“In that case, you would have found the door unbolted.”",
        "The commissary considered the situation for a moment, then asked\nthe countess:",
        "“Did any of your servants know that you wore the necklace last\nevening?”",
        "“Certainly; I didn’t conceal the fact. But nobody knew that it was\nhidden in that cabinet.”",
        "“No one?”",
        "“No one....unless....”",
        "“Be quite sure, madam, as it is a very important point.”",
        "She turned to her husband, and said:",
        "“I was thinking of Henriette.”",
        "“Henriette? She didn’t know where we kept it.”",
        "“Are you sure?”",
        "“Who is this woman Henriette?” asked Mon. Valorbe.",
        "“A school-mate, who was disowned by her family for marrying beneath\nher. After her husband’s death, I furnished an apartment in this\nhouse for her and her son. She is clever with her needle and has\ndone some work for me.”",
        "“What floor is she on?”",
        "“Same as ours....at the end of the corridor....and I think....\nthe window of her kitchen....”",
        "“Opens on this little court, does it not?”",
        "“Yes, just opposite ours.”",
        "Mon. Valorbe then asked to see Henriette. They went to her\napartment; she was sewing, whilst her son Raoul, about six years\nold, was sitting beside her, reading. The commissary was surprised\nto see the wretched apartment that had been provided for the woman.\nIt consisted of one room without a fireplace, and a very small room\nthat served as a kitchen. The commissary proceeded to question\nher. She appeared to be overwhelmed on learning of the theft.\nLast evening she had herself dressed the countess and placed the\nnecklace upon her shoulders.",
        "“Good God!” she exclaimed, “it can’t be possible!”",
        "“And you have no idea? Not the least suspicion? Is it possible\nthat the thief may have passed through your room?”",
        "She laughed heartily, never supposing that she could be an object\nof suspicion.",
        "“But I have not left my room. I never go out. And, perhaps, you\nhave not seen?”",
        "She opened the kitchen window, and said:",
        "“See, it is at least three metres to the ledge of the opposite\nwindow.”",
        "“Who told you that we supposed the theft might have been committed\nin that way?”",
        "“But....the necklace was in the cabinet, wasn’t it?”",
        "“How do you know that?”",
        "“Why, I have always known that it was kept there at night. It had\nbeen mentioned in my presence.”",
        "Her face, though still young, bore unmistakable traces of sorrow\nand resignation. And it now assumed an expression of anxiety as if\nsome danger threatened her. She drew her son toward her. The\nchild took her hand, and kissed it affectionately.",
        "When they were alone again, the count said to the commissary:",
        "“I do not suppose you suspect Henriette. I can answer for her.\nShe is honesty itself.”",
        "“I quite agree with you,” replied Mon. Valorbe. “At most, I\nthought there might have been an unconscious complicity. But I\nconfess that even that theory must be abandoned, as it does not\nhelp solve the problem now before us.”",
        "The commissary of police abandoned the investigation, which was now\ntaken up and completed by the examining judge. He questioned the\nservants, examined the condition of the bolt, experimented with the\nopening and closing of the cabinet window, and explored the little\ncourt from top to bottom. All was in vain. The bolt was intact.\nThe window could not be opened or closed from the outside.",
        "The inquiries especially concerned Henriette, for, in spite of\neverything, they always turned in her direction. They made a\nthorough investigation of her past life, and ascertained that,\nduring the last three years, she had left the house only four\ntimes, and her business, on those occasions, was satisfactorily\nexplained. As a matter of fact, she acted as chambermaid and\nseamstress to the countess, who treated her with great strictness\nand even severity.",
        "At the end of a week, the examining judge had secured no more\ndefinite information than the commissary of police. The judge\nsaid:",
        "“Admitting that we know the guilty party, which we do not, we are\nconfronted by the fact that we do not know hoe the theft was\ncommitted. We are brought face to face with two obstacles: a door\nand a window--both closed and fastened. It is thus a double\nmystery. How could anyone enter, and, moreover, how could any one\nescape, leaving behind him a bolted door and a fastened window?”",
        "At the end of four months, the secret opinion of the judge was that\nthe count and countess, being hard pressed for money, which was\ntheir normal condition, had sold the Queen’s Necklace. He closed\nthe investigation.",
        "The loss of the famous jewel was a severe blow to the Dreux-\nSoubise. Their credit being no longer propped up by the reserve\nfund that such a treasure constituted, they found themselves\nconfronted by more exacting creditors and money-lenders. They were\nobliged to cut down to the quick, to sell or mortgage every article\nthat possessed any commercial value. In brief, it would have been\ntheir ruin, if two large legacies from some distant relatives had\nnot saved them.",
        "Their pride also suffered a downfall, as if they had lost a\nquartering from their escutcheon. And, strange to relate, it was\nupon her former schoolmate, Henriette, that the countess vented her\nspleen. Toward her, the countess displayed the most spiteful\nfeelings, and even openly accused her. First, Henriette was\nrelegated to the servants’ quarters, and, next day, discharged.",
        "For some time, the count and countess passed an uneventful life.\nThey traveled a great deal. Only one incident of record occurred\nduring that period. Some months after the departure of Henriette,\nthe countess was surprised when she received and read the following\nletter, signed by Henriette:",
        "“Madame,\"\n\"I do not know how to thank you; for it was you, was it not, who\nsent me that? It could not have been anyone else. No one but you\nknows where I live. If I am wrong, excuse me, and accept my\nsincere thanks for your past favors....”",
        "What did the letter mean? The present or past favors of the\ncountess consisted principally of injustice and neglect. Why,\nthen, this letter of thanks?",
        "When asked for an explanation, Henriette replied that she had\nreceived a letter, through the mails, enclosing two bank-notes of\none thousand francs each. The envelope, which she enclosed with\nher reply, bore the Paris post-mark, and was addressed in a\nhandwriting that was obviously disguised. Now, whence came those\ntwo thousand francs? Who had sent them? And why had they sent\nthem?",
        "Henriette received a similar letter and a like sum of money twelve\nmonths later. And a third time; and a fourth; and each year for a\nperiod of six years, with this difference, that in the fifth and\nsixth years the sum was doubled. There was another difference:\nthe post-office authorities having seized one of the letters under\nthe pretext that it was not registered, the last two letters were\nduly sent according to the postal regulations, the first dated from\nSaint-Germain, the other from Suresnes. The writer signed the\nfirst one, “Anquety\"; and the other, “Pechard.” The addresses that\nhe gave were false.",
        "At the end of six years, Henriette dies, and the mystery remained\nunsolved.",
        "All these events are known to the public. The case was one of\nthose which excite public interest, and it was a strange\ncoincidence that this necklace, which had caused such a great\ncommotion in France at the close of the eighteenth century, should\ncreate a similar commotion a century later. But what I am about to\nrelate is known only to the parties directly interested and a few\nothers from whom the count exacted a promise of secrecy. As it is\nprobable that some day or other that promise will be broken, I have\nno hesitation in rending the veil and thus disclosing the key to\nthe mystery, the explanation of the letter published in the morning\npapers two days ago; an extraordinary letter which increased, if\npossible, the mists and shadows that envelope this inscrutable\ndrama.",
        "Five days ago, a number of guests were dining with the Count de\nDreux-Soubise. There were several ladies present, including his\ntwo nieces and his cousin, and the following gentlemen: the\npresident of Essaville, the deputy Bochas, the chevalier Floriani,\nwhom the count had known in Sicily, and General Marquis de\nRouzieres, and old club friend.",
        "After the repast, coffee was served by the ladies, who gave the\ngentlemen permission to smoke their cigarettes, provided they would\nnot desert the salon. The conversation was general, and finally\none of the guests chanced to speak of celebrated crimes. And that\ngave the Marquis de Rouzieres, who delighted to tease the count, an\nopportunity to mention the affair of the Queen’s Necklace, a\nsubject that the count detested.",
        "Each one expressed hi own opinion of the affair; and, of course,\ntheir various theories were not only contradictory but impossible.",
        "“And you, monsieur,” said the countess to the chevalier Floriani,\n\"what is your opinion?”",
        "“Oh! I--I have no opinion, madame.”",
        "All the guests protested; for the chevalier had just related in an\nentertaining manner various adventures in which he had participated\nwith his father, a magistrate at Palermo, and which established his\njudgment and taste in such manners.",
        "“I confess,” said he, “I have sometimes succeeded in unraveling\nmysteries that the cleverest detectives have renounced; yet I do\nnot claim to be Sherlock Holmes. Moreover, I know very little\nabout the affair of the Queen’s Necklace.”",
        "Everybody now turned to the count, who was thus obliged, quite\nunwillingly, to narrate all the circumstances connected with the\ntheft. The chevalier listened, reflected, asked a few questions,\nand said:",
        "“It is very strange....at first sight, the problem appears to be a\nvery simple one.”",
        "The count shrugged his shoulders. The others drew closer to the\nchevalier, who continued, in a dogmatic tone:",
        "“As a general rule, in order to find the author of a crime or a\ntheft, it is necessary to determine how that crime or theft was\ncommitted, or, at least, how it could have been committed. In the\npresent case, nothing is more simple, because we are face to face,\nnot with several theories, but with one positive fact, that is to\nsay: the thief could only enter by the chamber door or the window\nof the cabinet. Now, a person cannot open a bolted door from the\noutside. Therefore, he must have entered through the window.”",
        "“But it was closed and fastened, and we fount it fastened\nafterward,” declared the count.",
        "“In order to do that,” continued Floriani, without heeding the\ninterruption, “he had simply to construct a bridge, a plank or a\nladder, between the balcony of the kitchen and the ledge of the\nwindow, and as the jewel-case---”",
        "“But I repeat that the window was fastened,” exclaimed the count,\nimpatiently.",
        "This time, Floriani was obliged to reply. He did so with\nthe greatest tranquility, as if the objection was the most\ninsignificant affair in the world.",
        "“I will admit that it was; but is there not a transom in the upper\npart of the window?”",
        "“How do you know that?”",
        "“In the first place, that was customary in houses of that date;\nand, in the second place, without such a transom, the theft cannot\nbe explained.”",
        "“Yes, there is one, but it was closed, the same as the window.\nConsequently, we did not pay attention to it.”",
        "“That was a mistake; for, if you had examined it, you would have\nfound that it had been opened.”",
        "“But how?”",
        "“I presume that, like all others, it opens by means of a wire with\na ring on the lower end.”",
        "“Yes, but I do not see---”",
        "“Now, through a hole in the window, a person could, by the aid of\nsome instrument, let us say a poker with a hook at the end, grip\nthe ring, pull down, and open the transom.”",
        "The count laughed and said:",
        "“Excellent! excellent! Your scheme is very cleverly constructed,\nbut you overlook one thing, monsieur, there is no hole in the\nwindow.”",
        "“There was a hole.”",
        "“Nonsense, we would have seen it.”",
        "“In order to see it, you must look for it, and no one has looked.\nThe hole is there; it must be there, at the side of the window, in\nthe putty. In a vertical direction, of course.”",
        "The count arose. He was greatly excited. He paced up and down the\nroom, two or three times, in a nervous manner; then, approaching\nFloriani, said:",
        "“Nobody has been in that room since; nothing has been changed.”",
        "“Very well, monsieur, you can easily satisfy yourself that my\nexplanation is correct.”",
        "“It does not agree with the facts established by the examining\njudge. You have seen nothing, and yet you contradict all that we\nhave seen and all that we know.”",
        "Floriani paid no attention to the count’s petulance. He simply\nsmiled and said:",
        "“Mon Dieu, monsieur, I submit my theory; that is all. If I am\nmistaken, you can easily prove it.”",
        "“I will do so at once....I confess that you assurance---”",
        "The count muttered a few more words; then suddenly rushed to the\ndoor and passed out. Not a word was uttered in his absence; and\nthis profound silence gave the situation an air of almost tragic\nimportance. Finally, the count returned. He was pale and nervous.\nHe said to his friends, in a trembling voice:",
        "“I beg your pardon....the revelations of the chevalier were so\nunexpected....I should never have thought....”",
        "His wife questioned him, eagerly:",
        "“Speak....what is it?”",
        "He stammered: “The hole is there, at the very spot, at the side of\nthe window---”",
        "He seized the chevalier’s arm, and said to him in an imperious\ntone:",
        "“Now, monsieur, proceed. I admit that you are right so far, but\nnow....that is not all....go on....tell us the rest of it.”",
        "Floriani disengaged his arm gently, and, after a moment, continued:",
        "“Well, in my opinion, this is what happened. The thief, knowing\nthat the countess was going to wear the necklace that evening, had\nprepared his gangway or bridge during you absence. He watched you\nthrough the window and saw you hide the necklace. Afterward, he\ncut the glass and pulled the ring.”",
        "“Ah! but the distance was so great that it would be impossible for\nhim to reach the window-fastening through the transom.”",
        "“Well, then, if he could not open the window by reaching through\nthe transom, he must have crawled through the transom.”",
        "“Impossible; it is too small. No man could crawl through it.”",
        "“Then it was not a man,” declared Floriani.",
        "“What!”",
        "“If the transom is too small to admit a man, it must have been a\nchild.”",
        "“A child!”",
        "“Did you not say that your friend Henriette had a son?”",
        "“Yes; a son named Raoul.”",
        "“Then, in all probability, it was Raoul who committed the theft.”",
        "“What proof have you of that?”",
        "“What proof! Plenty of it....For instance---”",
        "He stopped, and reflected for a moment, then continued:",
        "“For instance, that gangway or bridge. It is improbable that the\nchild could have brought it in from outside the house and carried\nit away again without being observed. He must have used something\nclose at hand. In the little room used by Henriette as a kitchen,\nwere there not some shelves against the wall on which she placed\nher pans and dishes?”",
        "“Two shelves, to the best of my memory.”",
        "“Are you sure that those shelves are really fastened to the wooden\nbrackets that support them? For, if they are nor, we could be\njustified in presuming that the child removed them, fastened them\ntogether, and thus formed his bridge. Perhaps, also, since there\nwas a stove, we might find the bent poker that he used to open the\ntransom.”",
        "Without saying a word, the count left the room; and, this time,\nthose present did not feel the nervous anxiety they had experienced\nthe first time. They were confident that Floriani was right, and\nno one was surprised when the count returned and declared:",
        "“It was the child. Everything proves it.”",
        "“You have seen the shelves and the poker?”",
        "“Yes. The shelves have been unnailed, and the poker is there yet.”",
        "But the countess exclaimed:",
        "“You had better say it was his mother. Henriette is the guilty\nparty. She must have compelled her son---”",
        "“No,” declared the chevalier, “the mother had nothing to do with\nit.”",
        "“Nonsense! they occupied the same room. The child could not have\ndone it without the mother’s knowledge.”",
        "“True, they lived in the same room, but all this happened in the\nadjoining room, during the night, while the mother was asleep.”",
        "“And the necklace?” said the count. “It would have been found\namongst the child’s things.”",
        "“Pardon me! He had been out. That morning, on which you found him\nreading, he had just come from school, and perhaps the commissary\nof police, instead of wasting his time on the innocent mother,\nwould have been better employed in searching the child’s desk\namongst his school-books.”",
        "“But how do you explain those two thousand francs that Henriette\nreceived each year? Are they not evidence of her complicity?”",
        "“If she had been an accomplice, would she have thanked you for that\nmoney? And then, was she not closely watched? But the child,\nbeing free, could easily go to a neighboring city, negotiate with\nsome dealer and sell him one diamond or two diamonds, as he might\nwish, upon condition that the money should be sent from Paris, and\nthat proceeding could be repeated from year to year.”",
        "An indescribable anxiety oppressed the Dreux-Soubise and their\nguests. There was something in the tone and attitude of Floriani--\nsomething more that the chevalier’s assurance which, from the\nbeginning, had so annoyed the count. There was a touch of irony,\nthat seemed rather hostile than sympathetic. But the count\naffected to laugh, as he said:",
        "“All that is very ingenious and interesting, and I congratulate you\nupon your vivid imagination.”",
        "“No, not at all,” replied Floriani, with the utmost gravity, “I\nimagine nothing. I simply describe the events as they must have\noccurred.”",
        "“But what do you know about them?”",
        "“What you yourself have told me. I picture to myself the life of\nthe mother and child down there in the country; the illness of the\nmother, the schemes of and inventions of the child sell the\nprecious stones in order to save his mother’s life, or, at least,\nsoothe her dying moments. Her illness overcomes her. She dies.\nYears roll on. The child becomes a man; and then--and now I will\ngive my imagination a free rein--let us suppose that the man feels a\ndesire to return to the home of his childhood, that he does so, and\nthat he meets there certain people who suspect and accuse his\nmother....do you realize the sorrow and anguish of such an\ninterview in the very house wherein the original drama was played?”",
        "His words seemed to echo for a few seconds in the ensuing silence,\nand one could read upon the faces of the Count and Countess de\nDreux a bewildered effort to comprehend his meaning and, at the\nsame time, the fear and anguish of such a comprehension. The count\nspoke at last, and said:",
        "“Who are you, monsieur?”",
        "“I? The chevalier Floriani, whom you met at Palermo, and whom you\nhave been gracious enough to invite to your house on several\noccasions.”",
        "“Then what does this story mean?”",
        "“Oh! nothing at all! It is simply a pastime, so far as I am\nconcerned. I endeavor to depict the pleasure that Henriette’s son,\nif he still lives, would have in telling you that he was the guilty\nparty, and that he did it because his mother was unhappy, as she\nwas on the point of losing the place of a....servant, by which she\nlived, and because the child suffered at sight of his mother’s\nsorrow.”",
        "He spoke with suppressed emotion, rose partially and inclined\ntoward the countess. There could be no doubt that the chevalier\nFloriani was Henriette’s son. His attitude and words proclaimed\nit. Besides, was it not his obvious intention and desire to be\nrecognized as such?",
        "The count hesitated. What action would he take against the\naudacious guest? Ring? Provoke a scandal? Unmask the man who had\nonce robbed him? But that was a long time ago! And who would\nbelieve that absurd story about the guilty child? No; better far\nto accept the situation, and pretend not to comprehend the true\nmeaning of it. So the count, turning to Floriani, exclaimed:",
        "“Your story is very curious, very entertaining; I enjoyed it much.\nBut what do you think has become of this young man, this model son?\nI hope he has not abandoned the career in which he made such a\nbrilliant debut.”",
        "“Oh! certainly not.”",
        "“After such a debut! To steal the Queen’s Necklace at six years of\nage; the celebrated necklace that was coveted by Marie-Antoinette!”",
        "“And to steal it,” remarked Floriani, falling in with the count’s\nmood, “without costing him the slightest trouble, without anyone\nthinking to examine the condition of the window, or to observe that\nthe window-sill was too clean--that window-sill which he had wiped\nin order to efface the marks he had made in the thick dust. We\nmust admit that it was sufficient to turn the head of a boy at that\nage. It was all so easy. He had simply to desire the thing, and\nreach out his hand to get it.”",
        "“And he reached out his hand.”",
        "“Both hands,” replied the chevalier, laughing.",
        "His companions received a shock. What mystery surrounded the life\nof the so-called Floriani? How wonderful must have been the life\nof that adventurer, a thief at six years of age, and who, to-day,\nin search of excitement or, at most, to gratify a feeling of\nresentment, had come to brave his victim in her own house,\naudaciously, foolishly, and yet with all the grace and delicacy of\na courteous guest!",
        "He arose and approached the countess to bid her adieu. She\nrecoiled, unconsciously. He smiled.",
        "“Oh! Madame, you are afraid of me! Did I pursue my role of parlor-\nmagician a step too far?”",
        "She controlled herself, and replied, with her accustomed ease:",
        "“Not at all, monsieur. The legend of that dutiful son interested\nme very much, and I am pleased to know that my necklace had such a\nbrilliant destiny. But do you not think that the son of that\nwoman, that Henriette, was the victim of hereditary influence in\nthe choice of his vocation?”",
        "He shuddered, feeling the point, and replied:",
        "“I am sure of it; and, moreover, his natural tendency to crime must\nhave been very strong or he would have been discouraged.”",
        "“Why so?”",
        "“Because, as you must know, the majority of the diamonds were\nfalse. The only genuine stones were the few purchased from the\nEnglish jeweler, the others having been sold, one by one, to meet\nthe cruel necessities of life.”",
        "“It was still the Queen’s Necklace, monsieur,” replied the\ncountess, haughtily, “and that is something that he, Henriette’s\nson, could not appreciate.”",
        "“He was able to appreciate, madame, that, whether true or false,\nthe necklace was nothing more that an object of parade, an emblem\nof senseless pride.”",
        "The count made a threatening gesture, but his wife stopped him.",
        "“Monsieur,” she said, “if the man to whom you allude has the\nslightest sense of honor---”",
        "She stopped, intimidated by Floriani’s cool manner.",
        "“If that man has the slightest sense of honor,” he repeated.",
        "She felt that she would not gain anything by speaking to him in\nthat manner, and in spite of her anger and indignation, trembling\nas she was from humiliated pride, she said to him, almost politely:",
        "“Monsieur, the legend says that Retaux de Villette, when in\npossession of the Queen’s Necklace, did not disfigure the mounting.\nHe understood that the diamonds were simply the ornament, the\naccessory, and that the mounting was the essential work, the\ncreation of the artist, and he respected it accordingly. Do you\nthink that this man had the same feeling?”",
        "“I have no doubt that the mounting still exists. The child\nrespected it.”",
        "“Well, monsieur, if you should happen to meet him, will you tell\nhim that he unjustly keeps possession of a relic that is the\nproperty and pride of a certain family, and that, although the\nstones have been removed, the Queen’s necklace still belongs to the\nhouse of Dreux-Soubise. It belongs to us as much as our name or\nour honor.”",
        "The chevalier replied, simply:",
        "“I shall tell him, madame.”",
        "He bowed to her, saluted the count and the other guests, and\ndeparted.",
        "Four days later, the countess de Dreux found upon the table in her\nchamber a red leather case bearing the cardinal’s arms. She opened\nit, and found the Queen’s Necklace.",
        "But as all things must, in the life of a man who strives for unity\nand logic, converge toward the same goal--and as a little\nadvertising never does any harm--on the following day, the `Echo de\nFrance’ published these sensational lines:",
        "“The Queen’s Necklace, the famous historical jewelry stolen from\nthe family of Dreux-Soubise, has been recovered by Arsene Lupin,\nwho hastened to restore it to its rightful owner. We cannot too\nhighly commend such a delicate and chivalrous act.”",
        "I am frequently asked this question: “How did you make the\nacquaintance of Arsene Lupin?”",
        "My connection with Arsene Lupin was well known. The details that I\ngather concerning that mysterious man, the irrefutable facts that I\npresent, the new evidence that I produce, the interpretation that I\nplace on certain acts of which the public has seen only the\nexterior manifestations without being able to discover the secret\nreasons or the invisible mechanism, all establish, if not an\nintimacy, at least amicable relations and regular confidences.",
        "But how did I make his acquaintance? Why was I selected to be his\nhistoriographer? Why I, and not some one else?",
        "The answer is simple: chance alone presided over my choice; my\nmerit was not considered. It was chance that put me in his way.\nIt was by chance that I was participant in one of his strangest and\nmost mysterious adventures; and by chance that I was an actor in a\ndrama of which he was the marvelous stage director; an obscure and\nintricate drama, bristling with such thrilling events that I feel a\ncertain embarrassment in undertaking to describe it.",
        "The first act takes place during that memorable night of 22 June,\nof which so much has already been said. And, for my part, I\nattribute the anomalous conduct of which I was guilty on that\noccasion to the unusual from of mind in which I found myself on my\nreturn home. I had dined with some friends at the Cascade\nrestaurant, and, the entire evening, whilst we smoked and the\norchestra played melancholy waltzes, we talked only of crimes and\nthefts, and dark and frightful intrigues. That is always a poor\noverture to a night’s sleep.",
        "The Saint-Martins went away in an automobile. Jean Daspry--that\ndelightful, heedless Daspry who, six months later, was killed in\nsuch a tragic manner on the frontier of Morocco--Jean Daspry and I\nreturned on foot through the dark, warm night. When we arrived in\nfront of the little house in which I had lived for a year at\nNeuilly, on the boulevard Maillot, he said to me:",
        "“Are you afraid?”",
        "“What an idea!”",
        "“But this house is so isolated....no neighbors....vacant\nlots....Really, I am not a coward, and yet---”",
        "“Well, you are very cheering, I must say.”",
        "“Oh! I say that as I would say anything else. The Saint-Martins\nhave impressed me with their stories of brigands and thieves.”",
        "We shook hands and said good-night. I took out my key and opened\nthe door.",
        "“Well, that is good,” I murmured, “Antoine has forgotten to light a\ncandle.”",
        "Then I recalled the fact that Antoine was away; I had given him a\nshort leave of absence. Forthwith, I was disagreeably oppressed by\nthe darkness and silence of the night. I ascended the stairs on\ntiptoe, and reached my room as quickly as possible; then, contrary\nto my usual habit, I turned the key and pushed the bolt.",
        "The light of my candle restored my courage. Yet I was careful to\ntake my revolver from its case--a large, powerful weapon--and place\nit beside my bed. That precaution completed my reassurance. I\nlaid down and, as usual, took a book from my night-table to read\nmyself to sleep. Then I received a great surprise. Instead of the\npaper-knife with which I had marked my place on the preceding, I\nfound an envelope, closed with five seals of red wax. I seized it\neagerly. It was addressed to me, and marked: “Urgent.”",
        "A letter! A letter addressed to me! Who could have put it in that\nplace? Nervously, I tore open the envelope, and read:",
        "“From the moment you open this letter, whatever happens, whatever\nyou may hear, do not move, do not utter one cry. Otherwise you are\ndoomed.”",
        "I am not a coward, and, quite as well as another, I can face real\ndanger, or smile at the visionary perils of imagination. But, let\nme repeat, I was in an anomalous condition of mind, with my nerves\nset on edge by the events of the evening. Besides, was there not,\nin my present situation, something startling and mysterious,\ncalculated to disturb the most courageous spirit?",
        "My feverish fingers clutched the sheet of paper, and I read and re-\nread those threatening words: “Do not move, do not utter one cry.\nOtherwise, you are doomed.”",
        "“Nonsense!” I thought. “It is a joke; the work of some cheerful\nidiot.”",
        "I was about to laugh--a good loud laugh. Who prevented me? What\nhaunting fear compressed my throat?",
        "At least, I would blow out the candle. No, I could not do it. “Do\nnot move, or you are doomed,” were the words he had written.",
        "These auto-suggestions are frequently more imperious than the most\npositive realities; but why should I struggle against them? I had\nsimply to close my eyes. I did so.",
        "At that moment, I heard a slight noise, followed by crackling\nsounds, proceeding from a large room used by me as a library. A\nsmall room or antechamber was situated between the library and my\nbedchamber.",
        "The approach of an actual danger greatly excited me, and I felt a\ndesire to get up, seize my revolver, and rush into the library. I\ndid not rise; I saw one of the curtains of the left window move.\nThere was no doubt about it: the curtain had moved. It was still\nmoving. And I saw--oh! I saw quite distinctly--in the narrow space\nbetween the curtains and the window, a human form; a bulky mass\nthat prevented the curtains from hanging straight. And it is\nequally certain that the man saw me through the large meshes of the\ncurtain. Then, I understood the situation. His mission was to\nguard me while the others carried away their booty. Should I rise\nand seize my revolver? Impossible! He was there! At the least\nmovement, at the least cry, I was doomed.",
        "Then came a terrific noise that shook the house; this was followed\nby lighter sounds, two or three together, like those of a hammer\nthat rebounded. At least, that was the impression formed in my\nconfused brain. These were mingled with other sounds, thus\ncreating a veritable uproar which proved that the intruders were\nnot only bold, but felt themselves secure from interruption.",
        "They were right. I did not move. Was it cowardice? No, rather\nweakness, a total inability to move any portion of my body,\ncombined with discretion; for why should I struggle? Behind that\nman, there were ten others who would come to his assistance.\nShould I risk my life to save a few tapestries and bibelots?",
        "Throughout the night, my torture endured. Insufferable torture,\nterrible anguish! The noises had stopped, but I was in constant\nfear of their renewal. And the man! The man who was guarding me,\nweapon in hand. My fearful eyes remained cast in his direction.\nAnd my heart beat! And a profuse perspiration oozed from every\npore of my body!",
        "Suddenly, I experienced an immense relief; a milk-wagon, whose\nsound was familiar to me, passed along the boulevard; and, at the\nsame time, I had an impression that the light of a new day was\ntrying to steal through the closed window-blinds.",
        "At last, daylight penetrated the room; other vehicles passed along\nthe boulevard; and all the phantoms of the night vanished. Then I\nput one arm out of the bed, slowly and cautiously. My eyes were\nfixed upon the curtain, locating the exact spot at which I must\nfire; I made an exact calculation of the movements I must make;\nthen, quickly, I seized my revolver and fired.",
        "I leaped from my bed with a cry of deliverance, and rushed to the\nwindow. The bullet had passed through the curtain and the window-\nglass, but it had not touched the man--for the very good reason that\nthere was none there. Nobody! Thus, during the entire night, I\nhad been hypnotized by a fold of the curtain. And, during that\ntime, the malefactors....Furiously, with an enthusiasm that nothing\ncould have stopped, I turned the key, opened the door, crossed the\nantechamber, opened another door, and rushed into the library. But\namazement stopped me on the threshold, panting, astounded, more\nastonished than I had been by the absence of the man. All the\nthings that I supposed had been stolen, furniture, books, pictures,\nold tapestries, everything was in its proper place.",
        "It was incredible. I could not believe my eyes. Notwithstanding\nthat uproar, those noises of removal....I made a tour, I inspected\nthe walls, I made a mental inventory of all the familiar objects.\nNothing was missing. And, what was more disconcerting, there was\nno clue to the intruders, not a sign, not a chair disturbed, not\nthe trace of a footstep.",
        "“Well! Well!” I said to myself, pressing my hands on my bewildered\nhead, “surely I am not crazy! I hear something!”",
        "Inch by inch, I made a careful examination of the room. It was in\nvain. Unless I could consider this as a discovery: Under a small\nPersian rug, I found a card--an ordinary playing card. It was the\nseven of hearts; it was like any other seven of hearts in French\nplaying-cards, with this slight but curious exception: The extreme\npoint of each of the seven red spots or hearts was pierced by a\nhole, round and regular as if made with the point of an awl.",
        "Nothing more. A card and a letter found in a book. But was not\nthat sufficient to affirm that I had not been the plaything of a\ndream?",
        "Throughout the day, I continued my searches in the library. It was\na large room, much too large for the requirements of such a house,\nand the decoration of which attested the bizarre taste of its\nfounder. The floor was a mosaic of multicolored stones, formed\ninto large symmetrical designs. The walls were covered with a\nsimilar mosaic, arranged in panels, Pompeiian allegories, Byzantine\ncompositions, frescoes of the Middle Ages. A Bacchus bestriding a\ncask. An emperor wearing a gold crown, a flowing beard, and\nholding a sword in his right hand.",
        "Quite high, after the style of an artist’s studio, there was a\nlarge window--the only one in the room. That window being always\nopen at night, it was probable that the men had entered through it,\nby the aid of a ladder. But, again, there was no evidence. The\nbottom of the ladder would have left some marks in the soft earth\nbeneath the window; but there were none. Nor were there any traces\nof footsteps in any part of the yard.",
        "I had no idea of informing the police, because the facts I had\nbefore me were so absurd and inconsistent. They would laugh at me.\nHowever, as I was then a reported on the staff of the `Gil Blas,’ I\nwrote a lengthy account of my adventure and it was published in the\npaper on the second day thereafter. The article attracted some\nattention, but no one took it seriously. They regarded it as a\nwork of fiction rather than a story of real life. The Saint-\nMartins rallied me. But Daspry, who took an interest in such\nmatters, came to see me, made a study of the affair, but reached no\nconclusion.",
        "A few mornings later, the door-bell rang, and Antoine came to\ninform me that a gentleman desired to see me. He would not give\nhis name. I directed Antoine to show him up. He was a man of\nabout forty years of age with a very dark complexion, lively\nfeatures, and whose correct dress, slightly frayed, proclaimed a\ntaste that contrasted strangely with his rather vulgar manners.\nWithout any preamble, he said to me--in a rough voice that confirmed\nmy suspicion as to his social position:",
        "“Monsieur, whilst in a cafe, I picked up a copy of the `Gil Blas,’\nand read your article. It interested me very much.",
        "“Thank you.”",
        "“And here I am.”",
        "“Ah!”",
        "“Yes, to talk to you. Are all the facts related by you quite\ncorrect?”",
        "“Absolutely so.”",
        "“Well, in that case, I can, perhaps, give you some information.”",
        "“Very well; proceed.”",
        "“No, not yet. First, I must be sure that the facts are exactly as\nyou have related them.”",
        "“I have given you my word. What further proof do you want?”",
        "“I must remain alone in this room.”",
        "“I do not understand,” I said, with surprise.",
        "“It’s an idea that occurred to me when reading your article.\nCertain details established an extraordinary coincidence with\nanother case that came under my notice. If I am mistaken, I shall\nsay nothing more. And the only means of ascertaining the truth is\nby my remaining in the room alone.”",
        "What was at the bottom of this proposition? Later, I recalled that\nthe man was exceedingly nervous; but, at the same time, although\nsomewhat astonished, I found nothing particularly abnormal about\nthe man or the request he had made. Moreover, my curiosity was\naroused; so I replied:",
        "“Very well. How much time do you require?”",
        "“Oh! three minutes--not longer. Three minutes, from now, I will\nrejoin you.”",
        "I left the room, and went downstairs. I took out my watch. One\nminute passed. Two minutes. Why did I feel so depressed? Why did\nthose moments seem so solemn and weird? Two minutes and a\nhalf....Two minutes and three quarters. Then I heard a pistol\nshot.",
        "I bounded up the stairs and entered the room. A cry of horror\nescaped me. In the middle of the room, the man was lying on his\nleft side, motionless. Blood was flowing from a wound in his\nforehead. Near his hand was a revolver, still smoking.",
        "But, in addition to this frightful spectacle, my attention was\nattracted by another object. At two feet from the body, upon the\nfloor, I saw a playing-card. It was the seven of hearts. I picked\nit up. The lower extremity of each of the seven spots was pierced\nwith a small round hole.",
        "A half-hour later, the commissary of police arrived, then the\ncoroner and the chief of the Surete, Mon. Dudouis. I had been\ncareful not to touch the corpse. The preliminary inquiry was very\nbrief, and disclosed nothing. There were no papers in the pockets\nof the deceased; no name upon his clothes; no initial upon his\nlinen; nothing to give any clue to his identity. The room was in\nthe same perfect order as before. The furniture had not been\ndisturbed. Yet this man had not come to my house solely for the\npurpose of killing himself, or because he considered my place the\nmost convenient one for his suicide! There must have been a motive\nfor his act of despair, and that motive was, no doubt, the result\nof some new fact ascertained by him during the three minutes he was\nalone.",
        "What was that fact? What had he seen? What frightful secret had\nbeen revealed to him? There was no answer to these questions.\nBut, at the last moment, an incident occurred that appeared to us\nof considerable importance. As two policemen were raising the body\nto place it on a stretcher, the left hand thus being disturbed, a\ncrumpled card fell from it. The card bore these words: “Georges\nAndermatt, 37 Rue de Berry.”",
        "What did that mean? Georges Andermatt was a rich banker in Paris,\nthe founder and president of the Metal Exchange which had given\nsuch an impulse to the metallic industries in France. He lived in\nprincely style; was the possessor of numerous automobiles, coaches,\nand an expensive racing-stable. His social affairs were very\nselect, and Madame Andermatt was noted for her grace and beauty.",
        "“Can that be the man’s name?” I asked.",
        "---------------",
        "The chief of the Surete leaned over him.",
        "“It is not he. Mon. Andermatt is a thin man, and slightly grey.”",
        "“But why this card?”",
        "“Have you a telephone, monsieur?”",
        "“Yes, in the vestibule. Come with me.”",
        "He looked in the directory, and then asked for number 415.21.",
        "“Is Mon. Andermatt at home?....Please tell him that Mon. Dudouis\nwished him to come at once to 102 Boulevard Maillot. Very\nimportant.”",
        "Twenty minutes later, Mon. Andermatt arrived in his automobile.\nAfter the circumstances had been explained to him, he was taken in\nto see the corpse. He displayed considerable emotion, and spoke,\nin a low tone, and apparently unwillingly:",
        "“Etienne Varin,” he said.",
        "“You know him?”",
        "“No....or, at least, yes....by sight only. His brother....”",
        "“Ah! he has a brother?”",
        "“Yes, Alfred Varin. He came to see me once on some matter of\nbusiness....I forget what it was.”",
        "“Where does he live?”",
        "“The two brothers live together--rue de Provence, I think.”",
        "“Do you know any reason why he should commit suicide?”",
        "“None.”",
        "“He held a card in his hand. It was your card with your address.”",
        "“I do not understand that. It must have been there by some chance\nthat will be disclosed by the investigation.”",
        "A very strange chance, I thought; and I felt that the others\nentertained the same impression.",
        "I discovered the same impression in the papers next day, and\namongst all my friends with whom I discussed the affair. Amid the\nmysteries that enveloped it, after the double discovery of the\nseven of hearts pierced with seven holes, after the two inscrutable\nevents that had happened in my house, that visiting card promised\nto throw some light on the affair. Through it, the truth may be\nrevealed. But, contrary to our expectations, Mon. Andermatt\nfurnished no explanation. He said:",
        "“I have told you all I know. What more can I do? I am greatly\nsurprised that my card should be found in such a place, and I\nsincerely hope the point will be cleared up.”",
        "It was not. The official investigation established that the Varin\nbrothers were of Swiss origin, had led a shifting life under\nvarious names, frequenting gambling resorts, associating with a\nband of foreigners who had been dispersed by the police after a\nseries of robberies in which their participation was established\nonly by their flight. At number 24 rue de Provence, where the\nVarin brothers had lived six years before, no one knew what had\nbecome of them.",
        "I confess that, for my part, the case seemed to me so complicated\nand so mysterious that I did not think the problem would ever be\nsolved, so I concluded to waste no more time upon it. But Jean\nDaspry, whom I frequently met at that period, became more and more\ninterested in it each day. It was he who pointed out to me that\nitem from a foreign newspaper which was reproduced and commented\nupon by the entire press. It was as follows:",
        "“The first trial of a new model of submarine boat, which is\nexpected to revolutionize naval warfare, will be given in presence\nof the former Emperor at a place that will be kept secret until the\nlast minute. An indiscretion has revealed its name; it is called\n`The Seven-of-Hearts.’”",
        "The Seven-of-Hearts! That presented a new problem. Could a\nconnection be established between the name of the sub-marine and\nthe incidents which we have related? But a connection of what\nnature? What had happened here could have no possible relation\nwith the sub-marine.",
        "“What do you know about it?” said Daspry to me. “The most diverse\neffects often proceed from the same cause.”",
        "Two days later, the following foreign news item was received and\npublished:",
        "“It is said that the plans of the new sub-marine `Seven-of-Hearts’\nwere prepared by French engineers, who, having sought, in vain, the\nsupport of their compatriots, subsequently entered into\nnegotiations with the British Admiralty, without success.”",
        "I do not wish to give undue publicity to certain delicate matters\nwhich once provoked considerable excitement. Yet, since all danger\nof injury therefrom has now come to an end, I must speak of the\narticle that appeared in the `Echo de France,’ which aroused so\nmuch comment at that time, and which threw considerable light upon\nthe mystery of the Seven-of-Hearts. This is the article as it was\npublished over the signature of Salvator:",
        " “THE AFFAIR OF THE SEVEN-OF-HEARTS.",
        " “A CORNER OF THE VEIL RAISED.",
        " “We will be brief. Ten years ago, a young mining engineer, Louis\n Lacombe, wishing to devote his time and fortune to certain studies,\n resigned his position he then held, and rented number 102 boulevard\n Maillot, a small house that had been recently built and decorated\n for an Italian count. Through the agency of the Varin brothers of\n Lausanne, one of whom assisted in the preliminary experiments and\n the other acted as financial agent, the young engineer was\n introduced to Georges Andermatt, the founder of the Metal Exchange.",
        " “After several interviews, he succeeded in interesting the banker\n in a sub-marine boat on which he was working, and it was agreed\n that as soon as the invention was perfected, Mon. Andermatt would\n use his influence with the Minister of Marine to obtain a series of\n trials under the direction of the government. For two years, Louis\n Lacombe was a frequent visitor at Andermatt’s house, and he\n submitted to the banker the various improvements he made upon his\n original plans, until one day, being satisfied with the perfection\n of his work, he asked Mon. Andermatt to communicate with the\n Minister of Marine. That day, Louis Lacombe dined at Mon.\n Andermatt’s house. He left there about half-past eleven at night.\n He has not been seen since.",
        " “A perusal of the newspapers of that date will show that the\n young man’s family caused every possible inquiry to be made, but\n without success; and it was the general opinion that Louis Lacombe--\n who was known as an original and visionary youth--had quietly left\n for parts unknown.",
        " “Let us accept that theory--improbable, though it be,--and let us\n consider another question, which is a most important one for our\n country: What has become of the plans of the sub-marine? Did Louis\n Lacombe carry them away? Are they destroyed?",
        " “After making a thorough investigation, we are able to assert,\n positively, that the plans are in existence, and are now in the\n possession of the two brothers Varin. How did they acquire such a\n possession? That is a question not yet determined; nor do we know\n why they have not tried to sell them at an earlier date. Did they\n fear that their title to them would be called in question? If so,\n they have lost that fear, and we can announce definitely, that the\n plans of Louis Lacombe are now the property of foreign power, and\n we are in a position to publish the correspondence that passed\n between the Varin brothers and the representative of that power.\n The `Seven-of-Hearts’ invented by Louis Lacombe has been actually\n constructed by our neighbor.",
        " “Will the invention fulfill the optimistic expectations of those\n who were concerned in that treacherous act?”",
        "And a post-script adds:",
        " “Later.--Our special correspondent informs us that the preliminary\n trial of the `Seven-of-Hearts’ has not been satisfactory. It is\n quite likely that the plans sold and delivered by the Varin\n brothers did not include the final document carried by Louis\n Lacombe to Mon. Andermatt on the day of his disappearance, a\n document that was indispensable to a thorough understanding of the\n invention. It contained a summary of the final conclusions of the\n inventor, and estimates and figures not contained in the other\n papers. Without this document, the plans are incomplete; one the\n other hand, without the plans, the document is worthless.",
        " “Now is the time to act and recover what belongs to us. It may\n be a difficult matter, but we rely upon the assistance of Mon.\n Andermatt. It will be to his interest to explain his conduct which\n has hitherto been so strange and inscrutable. He will explain not\n only why he concealed these facts at the time of the suicide of\n Etienne Varin, but also why he has never revealed the disappearance\n of the paper--a fact well known to him. He will tell why, during\n the last six years, he paid spies to watch the movements of the\n Varin brothers. We expect from him, not only words, but acts. And\n at once. Otherwise---”",
        "The threat was plainly expressed. But of what did it consist?\nWhat whip was Salvator, the anonymous writer of the article,\nholding over the head of Mon. Andermatt?",
        "An army of reporters attacked the banker, and ten interviewers\nannounced the scornful manner in which they were treated.\nThereupon, the `Echo de France’ announced its position in these\nwords:",
        "“Whether Mon. Andermatt is willing or not, he will be, henceforth,\nour collaborator in the work we have undertaken.”",
        "Daspry and I were dining together on the day on which that\nannouncement appeared. That evening, with the newspapers spread\nover my table, we discussed the affair and examined it from every\npoint of view with that exasperation that a person feels when\nwalking in the dark and finding himself constantly falling over the\nsame obstacles. Suddenly, without any warning whatsoever, the door\nopened and a lady entered. Her face was hidden behind a think\nveil. I rose at once and approached her.",
        "“Is it you, monsieur, who lives here?” she asked.",
        "“Yes, madame, but I do not understand---”",
        "“The gate was not locked,” she explained.",
        "“But the vestibule door?”",
        "She did not reply, and it occurred to me that she had used the\nservants’ entrance. How did she know the way? Then there was a\nsilence that was quite embarrassing. She looked at Daspry, and I\nwas obliged to introduce him. I asked her to be seated and explain\nthe object of her visit. She raised her veil, and I saw that she\nwas a brunette with regular features and, though not handsome, she\nwas attractive--principally, on account of her sad, dark eyes.",
        "“I am Madame Andermatt,” she said.",
        "“Madame Andermatt!” I repeated, with astonishment.",
        "After a brief pause, she continued with a voice and manner that\nwere quite easy and natural:",
        "“I have come to see you about that affair--you know. I thought I\nmight be able to obtain some information---”",
        "“Mon Dieu, madame, I know nothing but what has already appeared in\nthe papers. But if you will point out in what way I can help you. ...”",
        "“I do not know....I do not know.”",
        "Not until then did I suspect that her calm demeanor was assumed,\nand that some poignant grief was concealed beneath that air of\ntranquility. For a moment, we were silent and embarrassed. Then\nDaspry stepped forward, and said:",
        "“Will you permit me to ask you a few questions?”",
        "“Yes, yes,” she cried. “I will answer.”",
        "“You will answer....whatever those questions may be?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Did you know Louis Lacombe?” he asked.",
        "“Yes, through my husband.”",
        "“When did you see him for the last time?”",
        "“The evening he dined with us.”",
        "“At that time, was there anything to lead you to believe that you\nwould never see him again?”",
        "“No. But he had spoken of a trip to Russia--in a vague way.”",
        "“Then you expected to see him again?”",
        "“Yes. He was to dine with us, two days later.”",
        "“How do you explain his disappearance?”",
        "“I cannot explain it.”",
        "“And Mon. Andermatt?”",
        "“I do not know.”",
        "“Yet the article published in the `Echo de France’ indicates---”",
        "“Yes, that the Varin brothers had something to do with his\ndisappearance.”",
        "“Is that your opinion?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“On what do you base your opinion?”",
        "“When he left our house, Louis Lacombe carried a satchel containing\nall the papers relating to his invention. Two days later, my\nhusband, in a conversation with one of the Varin brothers, learned\nthat the papers were in their possession.”",
        "“And he did not denounce them?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Why not?”",
        "“Because there was something else in the satchel--something besides\nthe papers of Louis Lacombe.”",
        "“What was it?”",
        "She hesitated; was on the point of speaking, but, finally, remained\nsilent. Daspry continued:",
        "“I presume that is why your husband has kept a close watch over\ntheir movements instead of informing the police. He hoped to\nrecover the papers and, at the same time, that compromising article\nwhich has enabled the two brothers to hold over him threats of\nexposure and blackmail.”",
        "“Over him, and over me.”",
        "“Ah! over you, also?”",
        "“Over me, in particular.”",
        "She uttered the last words in a hollow voice. Daspry observed it;\nhe paced to and fro for a moment, then, turning to her, asked:",
        "“Had you written to Louis Lacombe?”",
        "“Of course. My husband had business with him--”",
        "“Apart from those business letters, had you written to Louis\nLacombe....other letters? Excuse my insistence, but it is\nabsolutely necessary that I should know the truth. Did you write\nother letters?”",
        "“Yes,” she replied, blushing.",
        "“And those letters came into the possession of the Varin brothers?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Does Mon. Andermatt know it?”",
        "“He has not seen them, but Alfred Varin has told him of their\nexistence and threatened to publish them if my husband should take\nany steps against him. My husband was afraid....of a scandal.”",
        "“But he has tried to recover the letters?”",
        "“I think so; but I do not know. You see, after that last interview\nwith Alfred Varin, and after some harsh words between me and my\nhusband in which he called me to account--we live as strangers.”",
        "“In that case, as you have nothing to lose, what do you fear?”",
        "“I may be indifferent to him now, but I am the woman that he has\nloved, the one he would still love--oh! I am quite sure of that,\"\nshe murmured, in a fervent voice, “he would still love me if he had\nnot got hold of those cursed letters----”",
        "“What! Did he succeed?....But the two brothers still defied\nhim?”",
        "“Yes, and they boasted of having a secure hiding-place.”",
        "“Well?”",
        "“I believe my husband discovered that hiding-place.”",
        "“Well?”",
        "“I believe my husband has discovered that hiding-place.”",
        "“Ah! where was it?”",
        "“Here.”",
        "“Here!” I cried in alarm.",
        "“Yes. I always had that suspicion. Louis Lacombe was very\ningenious and amused himself in his leisure hours, by making safes\nand locks. No doubt, the Varin brothers were aware of that fact\nand utilized one of Lacombe’s safes in which to conceal the\nletters....and other things, perhaps.”",
        "“But they did not live here,” I said.",
        "“Before you came, four months ago, the house had been vacant for\nsome time. And they may have thought that your presence here would\nnot interfere with them when they wanted to get the papers. But\nthey did not count on my husband, who came here on the night of 22\nJune, forced the safe, took what he was seeking, and left his card\nto inform the two brothers that he feared them no more, and that\ntheir positions were now reversed. Two days later, after reading\nthe article in the `Gil Blas,’ Etienne Varin came here, remained\nalone in this room, found the safe empty, and....killed\nhimself.”",
        "After a moment, Daspry said:",
        "“A very simple theory....Has Mon. Andermatt spoken to you since\nthen?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Has his attitude toward you changed in any way? Does he appear\nmore gloomy, more anxious?”",
        "“No, I haven’t noticed any change.”",
        "“And yet you think he has secured the letters. Now, in my opinion,\nhe has not got those letters, and it was not he who came here on\nthe night of 22 June.”",
        "“Who was it, then?”",
        "“The mysterious individual who is managing this affair, who holds\nall the threads in his hands, and whose invisible but far-reaching\npower we have felt from the beginning. It was he and his friends\nwho entered this house on 22 June; it was he who discovered the\nhiding-place of the papers; it was he who left Mon. Andermatt’s\ncard; it is he who now holds the correspondence and the evidence of\nthe treachery of the Varin brothers.”",
        "“Who is he?” I asked, impatiently.",
        "“The man who writes letters to the `Echo de France’....\nSalvator! Have not convincing evidence of that fact? Does he not\nmention in his letters certain details that no one could know,\nexcept the man who had thus discovered the secrets of the two\nbrothers?”",
        "“Well, then,” stammered Madame Andermatt, in great alarm, “he has\nmy letters also, and it is he who now threatens my husband. Mon\nDieu! What am I to do?”",
        "“Write to him,” declared Daspry. “Confide in him without reserve.\nTell him all you know and all you may hereafter learn. Your\ninterest and his interest are the same. He is not working against\nMon. Andermatt, but against Alfred Varin. Help him.”",
        "“How?”",
        "“Has your husband the document that completes the plans of Louis\nLacombe?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Tell that to Salvator, and, if possible, procure the document for\nhim. Write to him at once. You risk nothing.”",
        "The advice was bold, dangerous even at first sight, but Madame\nAndermatt had no choice. Besides, as Daspry had said, she ran no\nrisk. If the unknown writer were an enemy, that step would not\naggravate the situation. If he were a stranger seeking to\naccomplish a particular purpose, he would attach to those letters\nonly a secondary importance. Whatever might happen, it was the\nonly solution offered to her, and she, in her anxiety, was only too\nglad to act on it. She thanked us effusively, and promised to keep\nus informed.",
        "In fact, two days later, she sent us the following letter that she\nhad received from Salvator:",
        "“Have not found the letter, but I will get them. Rest easy. I am\nwatching everything. S.”",
        "I looked at the letter. It was in the same handwriting as the note\nI found in my book on the night of 22 June.",
        "Daspry was right. Salvator was, indeed, the originator of that\naffair.",
        "We were beginning to see a little light coming out of the darkness\nthat surrounded us, and an unexpected light was thrown on certain\npoints; but other points yet remained obscure--for instance, the\nfinding of the two seven-of-hearts. Perhaps I was unnecessarily\nconcerned about those two cards whose seven punctured spots had\nappeared to me under such startling circumstances! Yet I could not\nrefrain from asking myself: What role will they play in the drama?\nWhat importance do they bear? What conclusion must be drawn from\nthe fact that the submarine constructed from the plans of Louis\nLacombe bore the name of `Seven-of-Hearts’?",
        "Daspry gave little thought to the other two cards; he devoted all\nhis attention to another problem which he considered more urgent;\nhe was seeking the famous hiding-place.",
        "“And who know,” said he, “I may find the letters that Salvator did\nnot find--by inadvertence, perhaps. It is improbable that the Varin\nbrothers would have removed from a spot, which they deemed\ninaccessible, the weapon which was so valuable to them.”",
        "And he continued to search. In a short time, the large room held\nno more secrets for him, so he extended his investigations to the\nother rooms. He examined the interior and the exterior, the stones\nof the foundation, the bricks in the walls; he raised the slates of\nthe roof.",
        "One day, he came with a pickaxe and a spade, gave me the spade,\nkept the pickaxe, pointed to the adjacent vacant lots, and said:\n\"Come.”",
        "I followed him, but I lacked his enthusiasm. He divided the vacant\nland into several sections which he examined in turn. At last, in\na corner, at the angle formed by the walls of two neighboring\nproprietors, a small pile of earth and gravel, covered with briers\nand grass, attracted his attention. He attacked it. I was obliged\nto help him. For an hour, under a hot sun, we labored without\nsuccess. I was discouraged, but Daspry urged me on. His ardor was\nas strong as ever.",
        "At last, Daspry’s pickaxe unearthed some bones--the remains of a\nskeleton to which some scraps of clothing still hung. Suddenly, I\nturned pale. I had discovered, sticking in the earth, a small\npiece of iron cut in the form of a rectangle, on which I thought I\ncould see red spots. I stooped and picked it up. That little iron\nplate was the exact size of a playing-card, and the red spots, made\nwith red lead, were arranged upon it in a manner similar to the\nseven-of-hearts, and each spot was pierced with a round hole\nsimilar to the perforations in the two playing cards.",
        "“Listen, Daspry, I have had enough of this. You can stay if it\ninterests you. But I am going.”",
        "Was that simply the expression of my excited nerves? Or was it the\nresult of a laborious task executed under a burning sun? I know\nthat I trembled as I walked away, and that I went to bed, where I\nremained forty-eight hours, restless and feverish, haunted by\nskeletons that danced around me and threw their bleeding hearts at\nmy head.",
        "Daspry was faithful to me. He came to my house every day, and\nremained three or four hours, which he spent in the large room,\nferreting, thumping, tapping.",
        "“The letters are here, in this room,” he said, from time to time,\n\"they are here. I will stake my life on it.”",
        "On the morning of the third day I arose--feeble yet, but cured. A\nsubstantial breakfast cheered me up. But a letter that I received\nthat afternoon contributed, more than anything else, to my complete\nrecovery, and aroused in me a lively curiosity. This was the\nletter:",
        " “Monsieur,",
        " “The drama, the first act of which transpired on the night of 22\n June, is now drawing to a close. Force of circumstances compel me\n to bring the two principal actors in that drama face to face, and I\n wish that meeting to take place in your house, if you will be so\n kind as to give me the use of it for this evening from nine o’clock\n to eleven. It will be advisable to give your servant leave of\n absence for the evening, and, perhaps, you will be so kind as to\n leave the field open to the two adversaries. You will remember\n that when I visited your house on the night of 22 June, I took\n excellent care of your property. I feel that I would do you an\n injustice if I should doubt, for one moment, your absolute\n discretion in this affair. Your devoted,",
        "         “SALVATOR.”",
        "I was amused at the facetious tone of his letter and also at the\nwhimsical nature of his request. There was a charming display of\nconfidence and candor in his language, and nothing in the world\ncould have induced me to deceive him or repay his confidence with\ningratitude.",
        "I gave my servant a theatre ticket, and he left the house at eight\no’clock. A few minutes later, Daspry arrived. I showed him the\nletter.",
        "“Well?” said he.",
        "“Well, I have left the garden gate unlocked, so anyone can enter.”",
        "“And you--are you going away?”",
        "“Not at all. I intend to stay right here.”",
        "“But he asks you to go---”",
        "“But I am not going. I will be discreet, but I am resolved to see\nwhat takes place.”",
        "“Ma foi!” exclaimed Daspry, laughing, “you are right, and I shall\nstay with you. I shouldn’t like to miss it.”",
        "We were interrupted by the sound of the door-bell.",
        "“Here already?” said Daspry, “twenty minutes ahead of time!\nIncredible!”",
        "I went to the door and ushered in the visitor. It was Madame\nAndermatt. She was faint and nervous, and in a stammering voice,\nshe ejaculated:",
        "“My husband....is coming....he has an appointment....\nthey intend to give him the letters....”",
        "“How do you know?” I asked.",
        "“By chance. A message came for my husband while we were at dinner.\nThe servant gave it to me by mistake. My husband grabbed it\nquickly, but he was too late. I had read it.”",
        "“You read it?”",
        "“Yes. It was something like this: `At nine o’clock this evening,\nbe at Boulevard Maillot with the papers connected with the affair.\nIn exchange, the letters.’ So, after dinner, I hastened here.”",
        "“Unknown to your husband?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“What do you think about it?” asked Daspry, turning to me.",
        "“I think as you do, that Mon. Andermatt is one of the invited\nguests.”",
        "“Yes, but for what purpose?”",
        "“That is what we are going to find out.”",
        "I led the m to a large room. The three of us could hide\ncomfortably behind the velvet chimney-mantle, and observe all that\nshould happen in the room. We seated ourselves there, with Madame\nAndermatt in the centre.",
        "The clock struck nine. A few minutes later, the garden gate\ncreaked upon its hinges. I confess that I was greatly agitated. I\nwas about to learn the key to the mystery. The startling events of\nthe last few weeks were about to be explained, and, under my eyes,\nthe last battle was going to be fought. Daspry seized the hand of\nMadame Andermatt, and said to her:",
        "“Not a word, not a movement! Whatever you may see or hear, keep\nquiet!”",
        "Some one entered. It was Alfred Varin. I recognized him at once,\nowing to the close resemblance he bore to his brother Etienne.\nThere was the same slouching gait; the same cadaverous face covered\nwith a black beard.",
        "He entered with the nervous air of a man who is accustomed to fear\nthe presence of traps and ambushes; who scents and avoids them. He\nglanced about the room, and I had the impression that the chimney,\nmasked with a velvet portiere, did not please him. He took three\nsteps in our direction, when something caused him to turn and walk\ntoward the old mosaic king, with the flowing beard and flamboyant\nsword, which he examined minutely, mounting on a chair and\nfollowing with his fingers the outlines of the shoulders and head\nand feeling certain parts of the face. Suddenly, he leaped from\nthe chair and walked away from it. He had heard the sound of\napproaching footsteps. Mon. Andermatt appeared at the door.",
        "“You! You!” exclaimed the banker. “Was it you who brought me\nhere?”",
        "“I? By no means,” protested Varin, in a rough, jerky voice that\nreminded me of his brother, “on the contrary, it was your letter\nthat brought me here.”",
        "“My letter?”",
        "“A letter signed by you, in which you offered---”",
        "“I never wrote to you,” declared Mon. Andermatt.",
        "“You did not write to me!”",
        "Instinctively, Varin was put on his guard, not against the banker,\nbut against the unknown enemy who had drawn him into this trap. A\nsecond time, he looked in our direction, then walked toward the\ndoor. But Mon. Andermatt barred his passage.",
        "“Well, where are you going, Varin?”",
        "“There is something about this affair I don’t like. I am going\nhome. Good evening.”",
        "“One moment!”",
        "“No need of that, Mon. Andermatt. I have nothing to say to you.”",
        "“But I have something to say to you, and this is a good time to say\nit.”",
        "“Let me pass.”",
        "“No, you will not pass.”",
        "Varin recoiled before the resolute attitude of the banker, as he\nmuttered:",
        "“Well, then, be quick about it.”",
        "One thing astonished me; and I have no doubt my two companions\nexperienced a similar feeling. Why was Salvator not there? Was he\nnot a necessary party at this conference? Or was he satisfied to\nlet these two adversaries fight it out between themselves? At all\nevents, his absence was a great disappointment, although it did not\ndetract from the dramatic strength of the situation.",
        "After a moment, Mon. Andermatt approached Varin and, face to face,\neye to eye, said:",
        "“Now, after all these years and when you have nothing more to fear,\nyou can answer me candidly: What have you done with Louis Lacombe?”",
        "“What a question! AS if I knew anything about him!”",
        "“You do know! You and your brother were his constant companions,\nalmost lived with him in this very house. You knew all about his\nplans and his work. And the last night I ever saw Louis Lacombe,\nwhen I parted with him at my door, I saw two men slinking away in\nthe shadows of the trees. That, I am ready to swear to.”",
        "“Well, what has that to do with me?”",
        "“The two men were you and your brother.”",
        "“Prove it.”",
        "“The best proof is that, two days later, you yourself showed me the\npapers and the plans that belonged to Lacombe and offered to sell\nthem. How did these papers come into your possession?”",
        "“I have already told you, Mon. Andermatt, that we found them on\nLouis Lacombe’s table, the morning after his disappearance.”",
        "“That is a lie!”",
        "“Prove it.”",
        "“The law will prove it.”",
        "“Why did you not appeal to the law?”",
        "“Why? Ah! Why---,” stammered the banker, with a slight display of\nemotion.",
        "“You know very well, Mon. Andermatt, if you had the least certainty\nof our guilt, our little threat would not have stopped you.”",
        "“What threat? Those letters? Do you suppose I ever gave those\nletters a moment’s thought?”",
        "“If you did not care for the letters, why did you offer me\nthousands of francs for their return? And why did you have my\nbrother and me tracked like wild beasts?”",
        "“To recover the plans.”",
        "“Nonsense! You wanted the letters. You knew that as soon as you\nhad the letters in your possession, you could denounce us. Oh! no,\nI couldn’t part with them!”",
        "He laughed heartily, but stopped suddenly, and said:",
        "“But, enough of this! We are merely going over old ground. We\nmake no headway. We had better let things stand as they are.”",
        "“We will not let them stand as they are,” said the banker, “and\nsince you have referred to the letters, let me tell you that you\nwill not leave this house until you deliver up those letters.”",
        "“I shall go when I please.”",
        "“You will not.”",
        "“Be careful, Mon. Andermatt. I warn you---”",
        "“I say, you shall not go.”",
        "“We will see about that,” cried Varin, in such a rage that Madame\nAndermatt could not suppress a cry of fear. Varin must have heard\nit, for he now tried to force his way out. Mon. Andermatt pushed\nhim back. Then I saw him put his hand into his coat pocket.",
        "“For the last time, let me pass,” he cried.",
        "“The letters, first!”",
        "Varin drew a revolver and, pointing it at Mon. Andermatt, said:",
        "“Yes or no?”",
        "The banker stooped quickly. There was the sound of a pistol-shot.\nThe weapon fell from Varin’s hand. I was amazed. The shot was\nfired close to me. It was Daspry who had fired it at Varin,\ncausing him to drop the revolver. In a moment, Daspry was standing\nbetween the two men, facing Varin; he said to him, with a sneer:",
        "“You were lucky, my friend, very lucky. I fired at your hand and\nstruck only the revolver.”",
        "Both of them looked at him, surprised. Then he turned to the\nbanker, and said:",
        "“I beg your pardon, monsieur, for meddling in your business; but,\nreally, you play a very poor game. Let me hold the cards.”",
        "Turning again to Varin, Daspry said:",
        "“It’s between us two, comrade, and play fair, if you please.\nHearts are trumps, and I play the seven.”",
        "Then Daspry held up, before Varin’s bewildered eyes, the little\niron plate, marked with the seven red spots. It was a terrible\nshock to Varin. With livid features, staring eyes, and an air of\nintense agony, the man seemed to be hypnotized at the sight of it.",
        "“Who are you?” he gasped.",
        "“One who meddles in other people’s business, down to the very\nbottom.”",
        "“What do you want?”",
        "“What you brought here tonight.”",
        "“I brought nothing.”",
        "“Yes, you did, or you wouldn’t have come. This morning, you\nreceived an invitation to come here at nine o’clock, and bring with\nyou all the papers held by you. You are here. Where are the\npapers?”",
        "There was in Daspry’s voice and manner a tone of authority that I\ndid not understand; his manner was usually quite mild and\nconciliatory. Absolutely conquered, Varin placed his hand on one\nof his pockets, and said:",
        "“The papers are here.”",
        "“All of them?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“All that you took from Louis Lacombe and afterwards sold to Major\nvon Lieben?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Are these the copies or the originals?”",
        "“I have the originals.”",
        "“How much do you want for them?”",
        "“One hundred thousand francs.”",
        "“You are crazy,” said Daspry. “Why, the major gave you only twenty\nthousand, and that was like money thrown into the sea, as the boat\nwas a failure at the preliminary trials.”",
        "“They didn’t understand the plans.”",
        "“The plans are not complete.”",
        "“Then, why do you ask me for them?”",
        "“Because I want them. I offer you five thousand francs--not a sou\nmore.”",
        "“Ten thousand. Not a sou less.”",
        "“Agreed,” said Daspry, who now turned to Mon. Andermatt, and said:",
        "“Monsieur will kindly sign a check for the amount.”",
        "“But....I haven’t got---”",
        "“Your check-book? Here it is.”",
        "Astounded, Mon. Andermatt examined the check-book that Daspry\nhanded to him.",
        "“It is mine,” he gasped. “How does that happen?”",
        "“No idle words, monsieur, if you please. You have merely to sign.”",
        "The banker took out his fountain pen, filled out the check and\nsigned it. Varin held out his hand for it.",
        "“Put down your hand,” said Daspry, “there is something more.\"\nThen, to the banker, he said: “You asked for some letters, did you\nnot?”",
        "“Yes, a package of letters.”",
        "“Where are they, Varin?”",
        "“I haven’t got them.”",
        "------------------",
        "“Where are they, Varin?”",
        "“I don’t know. My brother had charge of them.”",
        "“They are hidden in this room.”",
        "“In that case, you know where they are.”",
        "“How should I know?”",
        "“Was it not you who found the hiding-place? You appear to be as\nwell informed....as Salvator.”",
        "“The letters are not in the hiding-place.”",
        "“They are.”",
        "“Open it.”",
        "Varin looked at him, defiantly. Were not Daspry and Salvator the\nsame person? Everything pointed to that conclusion. If so, Varin\nrisked nothing in disclosing a hiding-place already known.",
        "“Open it,” repeated Daspry.",
        "“I have not got the seven of hearts.”",
        "“Yes, here it is,” said Daspry, handing him the iron plate. Varin\nrecoiled in terror, and cried:",
        "“No, no, I will not.”",
        "“Never mind,” replied Daspry, as he walked toward the bearded king,\nclimbed on a chair and applied the seven of hearts to the lower\npart of the sword in such a manner that the edges of the iron plate\ncoincided exactly with the two edges of the sword. Then, with the\nassistance of an awl which he introduced alternately into each of\nthe seven holes, he pressed upon seven of the little mosaic stones.\nAs he pressed upon the seventh one, a clicking sound was heard, and\nthe entire bust of the King turned upon a pivot, disclosing a large\nopening lined with steel. It was really a fire-proof safe.",
        "“You can see, Varin, he safe is empty.”",
        "“So I see. Then, my brother has taken out the letters.”",
        "Daspry stepped down from the chair, approached Varin, and said:",
        "“Now, no more nonsense with me. There is another hiding-place.\nWhere is it?”",
        "“There is none.”",
        "“Is it money you want? How much?”",
        "“Ten thousand.”",
        "“Monsieur Andermatt, are those letters worth then thousand francs\nto you?”",
        "“Yes,” said the banker, firmly.",
        "Varin closed the safe, took the seven of hearts and placed it again\non the sword at the same spot. He thrust the awl into each of the\nseven holes. There was the same clicking sound, but this time,\nstrange to relate, it was only a portion of the safe that revolved\non the pivot, disclosing quite a small safe that was built within\nthe door of the larger one. The packet of letters was here, tied\nwith a tape, and sealed. Varin handed the packet to Daspry. The\nlatter turned to the banker, and asked:",
        "“Is the check ready, Monsieur Andermatt?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“And you have also the last document that you received from Louis\nLacombe--the one that completes the plans of the sub-marine?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "The exchange was made. Daspry pocketed the document and the\nchecks, and offered the packet of letters to Mon. Andermatt.",
        "“This is what you wanted, Monsieur.”",
        "The banker hesitated a moment, as if he were afraid to touch those\ncursed letters that he had sought so eagerly. Then, with a nervous\nmovement, he took them. Close to me, I heard a moan. I grasped\nMadame Andermatt’s hand. It was cold.",
        "“I believe, monsieur,” said Daspry to the banker, “that our\nbusiness is ended. Oh! no thanks. It was only by a mere chance\nthat I have been able to do you a good turn. Good-night.”",
        "Mon. Andermatt retired. He carried with him the letters written by\nhis wife to Louis Lacombe.",
        "“Marvelous!” exclaimed Daspry, delighted. “Everything is coming\nour way. Now, we have only to close our little affair, comrade.\nYou have the papers?”",
        "“Here they are--all of them.”",
        "Daspry examined them carefully, and then placed them in his pocket.",
        "“Quite right. You have kept your word,” he said.",
        "“But---”",
        "“But what?”",
        "“The two checks? The money?” said Varin, eagerly.",
        "“Well, you have a great deal of assurance, my man. How dare you\nask such a thing?”",
        "“I ask only what is due to me.”",
        "“Can you ask pay for returning papers that you stole? Well, I\nthink not!”",
        "Varin was beside himself. He trembled with rage; his eyes were\nbloodshot.",
        "“The money....the twenty thousand....” he stammered.",
        "“Impossible! I need it myself.”",
        "“The money!”",
        "“Come, be reasonable, and don’t get excited. It won’t do you any\ngood.”",
        "Daspry seized his arm so forcibly, that Varin uttered a cry of\npain. Daspry continued:",
        "“Now, you can go. The air will do you good. Perhaps you want me\nto show you the way. Ah! yes, we will go together to the vacant lot\nnear here, and I will show you a little mound of earth and stones\nand under it---”",
        "“That is false! That is false!”",
        "“Oh! no, it is true. That little iron plate with the seven spots\non it came from there. Louis Lacombe always carried it, and you\nburied it with the body--and with some other things that will prove\nvery interesting to a judge and jury.”",
        "Varin covered his face with his hands, and muttered:",
        "“All right, I am beaten. Say no more. But I want to ask you one\nquestion. I should like to know---”",
        "“What is it?”",
        "“Was there a little casket in the large safe?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“Was it there on the night of 22 June?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“What did it contain?”",
        "“Everything that the Varin brothers had put in it--a very pretty\ncollection of diamonds and pearls picked up here and there by the\nsaid brothers.”",
        "“And did you take it?”",
        "“Of course I did. Do you blame me?”",
        "“I understand....it was the disappearance of that casket that\ncaused my brother to kill himself.”",
        "“Probably. The disappearance of your correspondence was not a\nsufficient motive. But the disappearance of the casket....Is\nthat all you wish to ask me?”",
        "“One thing more: your name?”",
        "“You ask that with an idea of seeking revenge.”",
        "“Parbleu! The tables may be turned. Today, you are on top.\nTo-morrow---”",
        "“It will be you.”",
        "“I hope so. Your name?”",
        "“Arsene Lupin.”",
        "“Arsene Lupin!”",
        "The man staggered, as though stunned by a heavy blow. Those two\nwords had deprived him of all hope.",
        "Daspry laughed, and said:",
        "“Ah! did you imagine that a Monsieur Durand or Dupont could manage\nan affair like this? No, it required the skill and cunning of\nArsene Lupin. And now that you have my name, go and prepare your\nrevenge. Arsene Lupin will wait for you.”",
        "Then he pushed the bewildered Varin through the door.",
        "“Daspry! Daspry!” I cried, pushing aside the curtain. He ran to\nme.",
        "“What? What’s the matter?”",
        "“Madame Andermatt is ill.”",
        "He hastened to her, caused her to inhale some salts, and, while\ncaring for her, questioned me:",
        "“Well, what did it?”",
        "“The letters of Louis Lacombe that you gave to her husband.”",
        "He struck his forehead and said:",
        "“Did she think that I could do such a thing!...But, of course\nshe would. Imbecile that I am!”",
        "Madame Andermatt was now revived. Daspry took from his pocket a\nsmall package exactly similar to the one that Mon. Andermatt had\ncarried away.",
        "“Here are your letters, Madame. These are the genuine letters.”",
        "“But....the others?”",
        "“The others are the same, rewritten by me and carefully worded.\nYour husband will not find anything objectionable in them, and will\nnever suspect the substitution since they were taken from the safe\nin his presence.”",
        "“But the handwriting---”",
        "“There is no handwriting that cannot be imitated.”",
        "She thanked him in the same words she might have used to a man in\nher own social circle, so I concluded that she had not witnessed\nthe final scene between Varin and Arsene Lupin. But the surprising\nrevelation caused me considerable embarrassment. Lupin! My club\ncompanion was none other than Arsene Lupin. I could not realize\nit. But he said, quite at his ease:",
        "“You can say farewell to Jean Daspry.”",
        "“Ah!”",
        "“Yes, Jean Daspry is going on a long journey. I shall send him to\nMorocco. There, he may find a death worth of him. I may say that\nthat is his expectation.”",
        "“But Arsene Lupin will remain?”",
        "“Oh! Decidedly. Arsene Lupin is simply at the threshold of his\ncareer, and he expects---”",
        "I was impelled by curiosity to interrupt him, and, leading him away\nfrom the hearing of Madame Andermatt, I asked:",
        "“Did you discover the smaller safe yourself--the one that held the\nletters?”",
        "“Yes, after a great deal of trouble. I found it yesterday\nafternoon while you were asleep. And yet, God knows it was simple\nenough! But the simplest things are the ones that usually escape\nour notice.” Then, showing me the seven-of-hearts, he added: “Of\ncourse I had guessed that, in order to open the larger safe, this\ncard must be placed on the sword of the mosaic king.”",
        "“How did you guess that?”",
        "“Quite easily. Through private information, I knew that fact when\nI came here on the evening of 22 June---”",
        "“After you left me---”",
        "“Yes, after turning the subject of our conversation to stories of\ncrime and robbery which were sure to reduce you to such a nervous\ncondition that you would not leave your bed, but would allow me to\ncomplete my search uninterrupted.”",
        "“The scheme worked perfectly.”",
        "“Well, I knew when I came here that there was a casket concealed in\na safe with a secret lock, and that the seven-of-hearts was the key\nto that lock. I had merely to place the card upon the spot that\nwas obviously intended for it. An hour’s examination showed me\nwhere the spot was.”",
        "“One hour!”",
        "“Observe the fellow in mosaic.”",
        "“The old emperor?”",
        "“That old emperor is an exact representation of the king of hearts\non all playing cards.”",
        "“That’s right. But how does the seven of hearts open the larger\nsafe at one time and the smaller safe at another time? And why did\nyou open only the larger safe in the first instance? I mean on the\nnight of 22 June.”",
        "“Why? Because I always placed the seven of hearts in the same way.\nI never changed the position. But, yesterday, I observed that by\nreversing the card, by turning it upside down, the arrangement of\nthe seven spots on the mosaic was changed.”",
        "“Parbleu!”",
        "“Of course, parbleu! But a person has to think of those things.”",
        "“There is something else: you did not know the history of those\nletters until Madame Andermatt---”",
        "“Spoke of them before me? No. Because I found in the safe, besides\nthe casket, nothing but the correspondence of the two brothers\nwhich disclosed their treachery in regard to the plans.”",
        "“Then it was by chance that you were led, first, to investigate the\nhistory of the two brothers, and then to search for the plans and\ndocuments relating to the sub-marine?”",
        "“Simply by chance.”",
        "“For what purpose did you make the search?”",
        "“Mon Dieu!” exclaimed Daspry, laughing, “how deeply interested you\nare!”",
        "“The subject fascinates me.”",
        "“Very well, presently, after I have escorted Madame Andermatt to a\ncarriage, and dispatched a short story to the `Echo de France,’ I\nwill return and tell you all about it.”",
        "He sat down and wrote one of those short, clear-cut articles which\nserved to amuse and mystify the public. Who does not recall the\nsensation that followed that article produced throughout the entire\nworld?",
        "“Arsene Lupin has solved the problem recently submitted by\nSalvator. Having acquired possession of all the documents and\noriginal plans of the engineer Louis Lacombe, he has placed them in\nthe hands of the Minister of Marine, and he has headed a\nsubscription list for the purpose of presenting to the nation the\nfirst submarine constructed from those plans. His subscription is\ntwenty thousand francs.”",
        "“Twenty thousand francs! The checks of Mon. Andermatt?” I\nexclaimed, when he had given me the paper to read.",
        "“Exactly. It was quite right that Varin should redeem his\ntreachery.”",
        "And that is how I made the acquaintance of Arsene Lupin. That is\nhow I learned that Jean Daspry, a member of my club, was none other\nthan Arsene Lupin, gentleman-thief. That is how I formed very\nagreeable ties of friendship with that famous man, and, thanks to\nthe confidence with which he honored me, how I became his very\nhumble and faithful historiographer.",
        "At three o’clock in the morning, there were still half a dozen\ncarriages in front of one of those small houses which form only the\nside of the boulevard Berthier. The door of that house opened, and\na number of guests, male and female, emerged. The majority of them\nentered their carriages and were quickly driven away, leaving\nbehind only two men who walked down Courcelles, where they parted,\nas one of them lived in that street. The other decided to return\non foot as far as the Porte-Maillot. It was a beautiful winter’s\nnight, clear and cold; a night on which a brisk walk is agreeable\nand refreshing.",
        "But, at the end of a few minutes, he had the disagreeable\nimpression that he was being followed. Turning around, he saw a\nman sulking amongst the trees. He was not a coward; yet he felt it\nadvisable to increase his speed. Then his pursuer commenced to\nrun; and he deemed it prudent to draw his revolver and face him.\nBut he had no time. The man rushed at him and attacked him\nviolently. Immediately, they were engaged in a desperate struggle,\nwherein he felt that his unknown assailant had the advantage. He\ncalled for help, struggled, and was thrown down on a pile of\ngravel, seized by the throat, and gagged with a handkerchief that\nhis assailant forced into his mouth. His eyes closed, and the man\nwho was smothering him with his weight arose to defend himself\nagainst an unexpected attack. A blow from a cane and a kick from a\nboot; the man uttered two cries of pain, and fled, limping and\ncursing. Without deigning to pursue the fugitive, the new arrival\nstooped over the prostrate man and inquired:",
        "“Are you hurt, monsieur?”",
        "He was not injured, but he was dazed and unable to stand. His\nrescuer procured a carriage, placed him in it, and accompanied him\nto his house on the avenue de la Grande-Armee. On his arrival\nthere, quite recovered, he overwhelmed his saviour with thanks.",
        "“I owe you my life, monsieur, and I shall not forget it. I do not\nwish to alarm my wife at this time of night, but, to-morrow, she\nwill be pleased to thank you personally. Come and breakfast with\nus. My name is Ludovic Imbert. May I ask yours?”",
        "“Certainly, monsieur.”",
        "And he handed Mon. Imbert a card bearing the name: “Arsene Lupin.”",
        "At that time, Arsene Lupin did not enjoy the celebrity which the\nCahorn affair, his escape from the Prison de la Sante, and other\nbrilliant exploits, afterwards gained for him. He had not even\nused the name of Arsene Lupin. The name was specially invented to\ndesignate the rescuer of Mon. Imbert; that is to say, it was in\nthat affair that Arsene Lupin was baptized. Fully armed and ready\nfor the fray, it is true, but lacking the resources and authority\nwhich command success, Arsene Lupin was then merely an apprentice\nin a profession wherein he soon became a master.",
        "With what a thrill of joy he recalled the invitation he received\nthat night! At last, he had reached his goal! At last, he had\nundertaken a task worth of his strength and skill! The Imbert\nmillions! What a magnificent feast for an appetite like his!",
        "He prepared a special toilet for the occasion; a shabby frock-coat,\nbaggy trousers, a frayed silk hat, well-worn collar and cuffs, all\nquite correct in form, but bearing the unmistakable stamp of\npoverty. His cravat was a black ribbon pinned with a false\ndiamond. Thus accoutred, he descended the stairs of the house in\nwhich he lived at Montmartre. At the third floor, without\nstopping, he rapped on a closed door with the head of his cane. He\nwalked to the exterior boulevards. A tram-car was passing. He\nboarded it, and some one who had been following him took a seat\nbeside him. It was the lodger who occupied the room on the third\nfloor. A moment later, this man said to Lupin:",
        "“Well, governor?”",
        "“Well, it is all fixed.”",
        "“How?”",
        "“I am going there to breakfast.”",
        "“You breakfast--there!”",
        "“Certainly. Why not? I rescued Mon. Ludovic Imbert from certain\ndeath at your hands. Mon. Imbert is not devoid of gratitude. He\ninvited me to breakfast.”",
        "There was a brief silence. Then the other said:",
        "“But you are not going to throw up the scheme?”",
        "“My dear boy,” said Lupin, “When I arranged that little case of\nassault at battery, when I took the trouble at three o’clock in the\nmorning, to rap you with my cane and tap you with my boot at the\nrisk of injuring my only friend, it was not my intention to forego\nthe advantages to be gained from a rescue so well arranged and\nexecuted. Oh! no, not at all.”",
        "“But the strange rumors we hear about their fortune?”",
        "“Never mind about that. For six months, I have worked on this\naffair, investigated it, studied it, questioned the servants, the\nmoney-lenders and men of straw; for six months, I have shadowed the\nhusband and wife. Consequently, I know what I am talking about.\nWhether the fortune came to them from old Brawford, as they\npretend, or from some other source, I do not care. I know that it\nis a reality; that it exists. And some day it will be mine.”",
        "“Bigre! One hundred millions!”",
        "“Let us say ten, or even five--that is enough! They have a safe\nfull of bonds, and there will be the devil to pay if I can’t get my\nhands on them.”",
        "The tram-car stopped at the Place de l’Etoile. The man whispered\nto Lupin:",
        "“What am I to do now?”",
        "“Nothing, at present. You will hear from me. There is no hurry.”",
        "Five minutes later, Arsene Lupin was ascending the magnificent\nflight of stairs in the Imbert mansion, and Mon. Imbert introduced\nhim to his wife. Madame Gervaise Imbert was a short plump woman,\nand very talkative. She gave Lupin a cordial welcome.",
        "“I desired that we should be alone to entertain our saviour,” she\nsaid.",
        "From the outset, they treated “our saviour” as an old and valued\nfriend. By the time dessert was served, their friendship was well\ncemented, and private confidences were being exchanged. Arsene\nrelated the story of his life, the life of his father as a\nmagistrate, the sorrows of his childhood, and his present\ndifficulties. Gervaise, in turn, spoke of her youth, her marriage,\nthe kindness of the aged Brawford, the hundred millions that she\nhad inherited, the obstacles that prevented her from obtaining the\nenjoyment of her inheritance, the moneys she had been obliged to\nborrow at an exorbitant rate of interest, here endless contentions\nwith Brawford’s nephews, and the litigation! the injunctions! in\nfact, everything!",
        "“Just think of it, Monsieur Lupin, the bonds are there, in my\nhusband’s office, and if we detach a single coupon, we lose\neverything! They are there, in our safe, and we dare not touch\nthem.”",
        "Monsieur Lupin shivered at the bare idea of his proximity to so\nmuch wealth. Yet he felt quite certain that Monsieur Lupin would\nnever suffer from the same difficulty as his fair hostess who\ndeclared she dare not touch the money.",
        "“Ah! they are there!” he repeated, to himself; “they are there!”",
        "A friendship formed under such circumstances soon led to closer\nrelations. When discreetly questioned, Arsene Lupin confessed his\npoverty and distress. Immediately, the unfortunate young man was\nappointed private secretary to the Imberts, husband and wife, at a\nsalary of one hundred francs a month. He was to come to the house\nevery day and receive orders for his work, and a room on the second\nfloor was set apart as his office. This room was directly over\nMon. Imbert’s office.",
        "Arsene soon realized that his position as secretary was essentially\na sinecure. During the first two months, he had only four\nimportant letters to recopy, and was called only once to Mon.\nImbert’s office; consequently, he had only one opportunity to\ncontemplate, officially, the Imbert safe. Moreover, he noticed\nthat the secretary was not invited to the social functions of the\nemployer. But he did not complain, as he preferred to remain,\nmodestly, in the shade and maintain his peace and freedom.",
        "However, he was not wasting any time. From the beginning, he made\nclandestine visits to Mon. Imbert’s office, and paid his respects\nto the safe, which was hermetically closed. It was an immense\nblock of iron and steel, cold and stern in appearance, which could\nnot be forced open by the ordinary tools of the burglar’s trade.\nBut Arsene Lupin was not discouraged.",
        "“Where force fails, cunning prevails,” he said to himself. “The\nessential thing is to be on the spot when the opportunity occurs.\nIn the meantime, I must watch and wait.”",
        "He made immediately some preliminary preparations. After careful\nsoundings made upon the floor of his room, he introduced a lead\npipe which penetrated the ceiling of Mon. Imbert’s office at a\npoint between the two screeds of the cornice. By means of this\npipe, he hoped to see and hear what transpired in the room below.",
        "Henceforth, he passed his days stretched at full length upon the\nfloor. He frequently saw the Imberts holding a consultation in\nfront of the safe, investigating books and papers. When they\nturned the combination lock, he tried to learn the figures and the\nnumber of turns they made to the right and left. He watched their\nmovements; he sought to catch their words. There was also a key\nnecessary to complete the opening of the safe. What did they do\nwith it? Did they hide it?",
        "One day, he saw them leave the room without locking the safe. He\ndescended the stairs quickly, and boldly entered the room. But\nthey had returned.",
        "“Oh! excuse me,” said, “I made a mistake in the door.”",
        "“Come in, Monsieur Lupin, come in,” cried Madame Imbert, “are you\nnot at home here? We want your advice. What bonds should we sell?\nThe foreign securities or the government annuities?”",
        "“But the injunction?” said Lupin, with surprise.",
        "“Oh! it doesn’t cover all the bonds.”",
        "She opened the door of the safe and withdrew a package of bonds.\nBut her husband protested.",
        "“No, no, Gervaise, it would be foolish to sell the foreign bonds.\nThey are going up, whilst the annuities are as high as they ever\nwill be. What do you think, my dear friend?”",
        "The dear friend had no opinion; yet he advised the sacrifice of the\nannuities. Then she withdrew another package and, from it, she\ntook a paper at random. It proved to be a three-per-cent annuity\nworth two thousand francs. Ludovic placed the package of bonds in\nhis pocket. That afternoon, accompanied by his secretary, he sold\nthe annuities to a stock-broker and realized forty-six thousand\nfrancs.",
        "Whatever Madame Imbert might have said about it, Arsene Lupin did\nnot feel at home in the Imbert house. On the contrary, his\nposition there was a peculiar one. He learned that the servants\ndid not even know his name. They called him “monsieur.” Ludovic\nalways spoke of him in the same way: “You will tell monsieur. Has\nmonsieur arrived?” Why that mysterious appellation?",
        "Moreover, after their first outburst of enthusiasm, the Imberts\nseldom spoke to him, and, although treating him with the\nconsideration due to a benefactor, they gave him little or no\nattention. They appeared to regard him as an eccentric character\nwho did not like to be disturbed, and they respected his isolation\nas if it were a stringent rule on his part. On one occasion, while\npassing through the vestibule, he heard Madame Imbert say to the\ntwo gentlemen:",
        "“He is such a barbarian!”",
        "“Very well,” he said to himself, “I am a barbarian.”",
        "And, without seeking to solve the question of their strange\nconduct, he proceeded with the execution of his own plans. He had\ndecided that he could not depend on chance, nor on the negligence\nof Madame Imbert, who carried the key of the safe, and who, on\nlocking the safe, invariably scattered the letters forming the\ncombination of the lock. Consequently, he must act for himself.",
        "Finally, and incident precipitated matters; it was the vehement\ncampaign instituted against the Imberts by certain newspapers that\naccused the Imberts of swindling. Arsene Lupin was present at\ncertain family conferences when this new vicissitude was discussed.\nHe decided that if he waited much longer, he would lose everything.\nDuring the next five days, instead of leaving the house about six\no’clock, according to his usual habit, he locked himself in his\nroom. It was supposed that he had gone out. But he was lying on\nthe floor surveying the office of Mon. Imbert. During those five\nevenings, the favorable opportunity that he awaited did not take\nplace. He left the house about midnight by a side door to which he\nheld the key.",
        "But on the sixth day, he learned that the Imberts, actuated by the\nmalevolent insinuations of their enemies, proposed to make an\ninventory of the contents of the safe.",
        "“They will do it to-night,” thought Lupin.",
        "And truly, after dinner, Imbert and his wife retired to the office\nand commenced to examine the books of account and the securities\ncontained in the safe. Thus, one hour after another passed away.\nHe heard the servants go upstairs to their rooms. No one now\nremained on the first floor. Midnight! The Imberts were still at\nwork.",
        "“I must get to work,” murmured Lupin.",
        "He opened his window. It opened on a court. Outside, everything\nwas dark and quiet. He took from his desk a knotted rope, fastened\nit to the balcony in front of his window, and quietly descended as\nfar as the window below, which was that of the of Imbert’s office.\nHe stood upon the balcony for a moment, motionless, with attentive\near and watchful eye, but the heavy curtains effectually concealed\nthe interior of the room. He cautiously pushed on the double\nwindow. If no one had examined it, it ought to yield to the\nslightest pressure, for, during the afternoon, he had so fixed the\nbolt that it would not enter the staple.",
        "The window yielded to his touch. Then, with infinite care, he\npushed it open sufficiently to admit his head. He parted the\ncurtains a few inches, looked in, and saw Mon. Imbert and his wife\nsitting in front of the safe, deeply absorbed in their work and\nspeaking softly to each other at rare intervals.",
        "He calculated the distance between him and them, considered the\nexact movements he would require to make in order to overcome them,\none after the other, before they could call for help, and he was\nabout to rush upon them, when Madame Imbert said:",
        "“Ah! the room is getting quite cold. I am going to bed. And you,\nmy dear?”",
        "He calculated the distance between him and them, considered the\nexact movements he would require to make in order to overcome them,\none after the other, before they could call for help, and he was\nabout to rush upon them, when Madame Imbert said:",
        "“Ah! the room is getting quite cold. I am going to bed. And you,\nmy dear?”",
        "“I shall stay and finish.”",
        "“Finish! Why, that will take you all night.”",
        "“Not at all. An hour, at the most.”",
        "She retired. Twenty minutes, thirty minutes passed. Arsene pushed\nthe window a little farther open. The curtains shook. He pushed\nonce more. Mon. Imbert turned, and, seeing the curtains blown by\nthe wind, he rose to close the window.",
        "There was not a cry, not the trace of struggle. With a few precise\nmoments, and without causing him the least injury, Arsene stunned\nhim, wrapped the curtain about his head, bound him hand and foot,\nand did it all in such a manner that Mon. Imbert had no opportunity\nto recognize his assailant.",
        "Quickly, he approached the safe, seized two packages that he placed\nunder his arm, left the office, and opened the servants’ gate. A\ncarriage was stationed in the street.",
        "“Take that, first--and follow me,” he said to the coachman. He\nreturned to the office, and, in two trips, they emptied the safe.\nThen Arsene went to his own room, removed the rope, and all other\ntraces of his clandestine work.",
        "A few hours later, Arsene Lupin and his assistant examined the\nstolen goods. Lupin was not disappointed, as he had foreseen that\nthe wealth of the Imberts had been greatly exaggerated. It did not\nconsist of hundreds of millions, nor even tens of millions. Yet it\namounted to a very respectable sum, and Lupin expressed his\nsatisfaction.",
        "“Of course,” he said, “there will be a considerable loss when we\ncome to sell the bonds, as we will have to dispose of them\nsurreptitiously at reduced prices. In the meantime, they will rest\nquietly in my desk awaiting a propitious moment.”",
        "Arsene saw no reason why he should not go to the Imbert house the\nnext day. But a perusal of the morning papers revealed this\nstartling fact: Ludovic and Gervaise Imbert had disappeared.",
        "When the officers of the law seized the safe and opened it, they\nfound there what Arsene Lupin had left--nothing.",
        "Such are the facts; and I learned the sequel to them, one day, when\nArsene Lupin was in a confidential mood. He was pacing to and fro\nin my room, with a nervous step and a feverish eye that were\nunusual to him.”",
        "“After all,” I said to him, “it was your most successful venture.”",
        "Without making a direct reply, he said:",
        "“There are some impenetrable secrets connected with that affair;\nsome obscure points that escape my comprehension. For instance:\nWhat caused their flight? Why did they not take advantage of the\nhelp I unconsciously gave them? It would have been so simple to\nsay: `The hundred millions were in the safe. They are no longer\nthere, because they have been stolen.’”",
        "“They lost their nerve.”",
        "“Yes, that is it--they lost their nerve...On the other hand, it\nis true---”",
        "“What is true?”",
        "“Oh! nothing.”",
        "What was the meaning of Lupin’s reticence? It was quite obvious\nthat he had not told me everything; there was something he was\nloath to tell. His conduct puzzled me. It must indeed be a very\nserious matter to cause such a man as Arsene Lupin even a momentary\nhesitation. I threw out a few questions at random.",
        "“Have you seen them since?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“And have you never experienced the slightest degree of pity for\nthose unfortunate people?”",
        "“I!” he exclaimed, with a start.",
        "His sudden excitement astonished me. Had I touched him on a sore\nspot? I continued:",
        "“Of course. If you had not left them alone, they might have been\nable to face the danger, or, at least, made their escape with full\npockets.”",
        "“What do you mean?” he said, indignantly. “I suppose you have an\nidea that my soul should be filled with remorse?”",
        "“Call it remorse or regrets--anything you like---”",
        "“They are not worth it.”",
        "“Have you no regrets or remorse for having stolen their fortune?”",
        "“What fortune?”",
        "“The packages of bonds you took from their safe.”",
        "“Oh! I stole their bonds, did I? I deprived them of a portion of\ntheir wealth? Is that my crime? Ah! my dear boy, you do not know\nthe truth. You never imagined that those bonds were not worth the\npaper they were written on. Those bonds were false--they were\ncounterfeit--every one of them--do you understand? THEY WERE\nCOUNTERFEIT!”",
        "I looked at him, astounded.",
        "“Counterfeit! The four or five millions?”",
        "“Yes, counterfeit!” he exclaimed, in a fit of rage. “Only so many\nscraps of paper! I couldn’t raise a sou on the whole of them! And\nyou ask me if I have any remorse. THEY are the ones who should\nhave remorse and pity. They played me for a simpleton; and I fell\ninto their trap. I was their latest victim, their most stupid\ngull!”",
        "He was affected by genuine anger--the result of malice and wounded\npride. He continued:",
        "“From start to finish, I got the worst of it. Do you know the part\nI played in that affair, or rather the part they made me play?\nThat of Andre Brawford! Yes, my boy, that is the truth, and I\nnever suspected it. It was not until afterwards, on reading the\nnewspapers, that the light finally dawned in my stupid brain.\nWhilst I was posing as his “saviour,” as the gentleman who had\nrisked his life to rescue Mon. Imbert from the clutches of an\nassassin, they were passing me off as Brawford. Wasn’t that\nsplendid? That eccentric individual who had a room on the second\nfloor, that barbarian that was exhibited only at a distance, was\nBrawford, and Brawford was I! Thanks to me, and to the confidence\nthat I inspired under the name of Brawford, they were enabled to\nborrow money from the bankers and other money-lenders. Ha! what an\nexperience for a novice! And I swear to you that I shall profit by\nthe lesson!”",
        "He stopped, seized my arm, and said to me, in a tone of\nexasperation:",
        "“My dear fellow, at this very moment, Gervaise Imbert owes me\nfifteen hundred francs.”",
        "I could not refrain from laughter, his rage was so grotesque. He\nwas making a mountain out of a molehill. In a moment, he laughed\nhimself, and said:",
        "“Yes, my boy, fifteen hundred francs. You must know that I had not\nreceived one sou of my promised salary, and, more than that, she\nhad borrowed from me the sum of fifteen hundred francs. All my\nyouthful savings! And do you know why? To devote the money to\ncharity! I am giving you a straight story. She wanted it for some\npoor people she was assisting--unknown to her husband. And my hard-\nearned money was wormed out of me by that silly pretense! Isn’t it\namusing, hein? Arsene Lupin done out of fifteen hundred francs by\nthe fair lady from whom he stole four millions in counterfeit\nbonds! And what a vast amount of time and patience and cunning I\nexpended to achieve that result! It was the first time in my life\nthat I was played for a fool, and I frankly confess that I was\nfooled that time to the queen’s taste!”",
        "A violent ringing of the bell awakened the concierge of number\nnine, avenue Hoche. She pulled the doorstring, grumbling:",
        "“I thought everybody was in. It must be three o’clock!”",
        "“Perhaps it is some one for the doctor,” muttered her husband.",
        "“Third floor, left. But the doctor won’t go out at night.”",
        "“He must go to-night.”",
        "The visitor entered the vestibule, ascended to the first floor, the\nsecond, the third, and, without stopping at the doctor’s door, he\ncontinued to the fifth floor. There, he tried two keys. One of\nthem fitted the lock.",
        "“Ah! good!” he murmured, “that simplifies the business wonderfully.\nBut before I commence work I had better arrange for my retreat.\nLet me see....have I had sufficient time to rouse the doctor\nand be dismissed by him? Not yet....a few minutes more.”",
        "At the end of ten minutes, he descended the stairs, grumbling\nnoisily about the doctor. The concierge opened the door for him\nand heard it click behind him. But the door did not lock, as the\nman had quickly inserted a piece of iron in the lock in such a\nmanner that the bolt could not enter. Then, quietly, he entered\nthe house again, unknown to the concierge. In case of alarm, his\nretreat was assured. Noiselessly, he ascended to the fifth floor\nonce more. In the antechamber, by the light of his electric\nlantern, he placed his hat and overcoat on one of the chairs, took\na seat on another, and covered his heavy shows with felt slippers.",
        "“Ouf! Here I am--and how simple it was! I wonder why more people do\nnot adopt the profitable and pleasant occupation of burglar. With\na little care and reflection, it becomes a most delightful\nprofession. Not too quiet and monotonous, of course, as it would\nthen become wearisome.”",
        "He unfolded a detailed plan of the apartment.",
        "“Let me commence by locating myself. Here, I see the vestibule in\nwhich I am sitting. On the street front, the drawing-room, the\nboudoir and dinning-room. Useless to waste any time there, as it\nappears that the countess has a deplorable taste....not a\nbibelot of any value!...Now, let’s get down to business!...\nAh! here is a corridor; it must lead to the bed chambers. At a\ndistance of three metres, I should come to the door of the\nwardrobe-closet which connects with the chamber of the countess.\"\nHe folded his plan, extinguished his lantern, and proceeded down\nthe corridor, counting his distance, thus:",
        "“One metre....two metres....three metres....Here is\nthe door....Mon Dieu, how easy it is! Only a small, simple bolt\nnow separates me from the chamber, and I know that the bolt is\nlocated exactly one metre, forty-three centimeters, from the floor.\nSo that, thanks to a small incision I am about to make, I can soon\nget rid of the bolt.”",
        "He drew from his pocket the necessary instruments. Then the\nfollowing idea occurred to him:",
        "“Suppose, by chance, the door is not bolted. I will try it first.”",
        "He turned the knob, and the door opened.",
        "“My brave Lupin, surely fortune favors you....What’s to be\ndone now? You know the situation of the rooms; you know the place\nin which the countess hides the black pearl. Therefore, in order\nto secure the black pearl, you have simply to be more silent than\nsilence, more invisible than darkness itself.”",
        "Arsene Lupin was employed fully a half-hour in opening the second\ndoor--a glass door that led to the countess’ bedchamber. But he\naccomplished it with so much skill and precaution, that even had\nhad the countess been awake, she would not have heard the slightest\nsound. According to the plan of the rooms, that he holds, he has\nmerely to pass around a reclining chair and, beyond that, a small\ntable close to the bed. On the table, there was a box of letter-\npaper, and the black pearl was concealed in that box. He stooped\nand crept cautiously over the carpet, following the outlines of the\nreclining-chair. When he reached the extremity of it, he stopped\nin order to repress the throbbing of his heart. Although he was\nnot moved by any sense of fear, he found it impossible to overcome\nthe nervous anxiety that one usually feels in the midst of profound\nsilence. That circumstance astonished him, because he had passed\nthrough many more solemn moments without the slightest trace of\nemotion. No danger threatened him. Then why did his heart throb\nlike an alarm-bell? Was it that sleeping woman who affected him?\nWas it the proximity of another pulsating heart?",
        "He listened, and thought he could discern the rhythmical breathing\nof a person asleep. It gave him confidence, like the presence of a\nfriend. He sought and found the armchair; then, by slow, cautious\nmovements, advanced toward the table, feeling ahead of him with\noutstretched arm. His right had touched one of the feet of the\ntable. Ah! now, he had simply to rise, take the pearl, and escape.\nThat was fortunate, as his heart was leaping in his breast like a\nwild beast, and made so much noise that he feared it would waken\nthe countess. By a powerful effort of the will, he subdued the\nwild throbbing of his heart, and was about to rise from the floor\nwhen his left hand encountered, lying on the floor, an object which\nhe recognized as a candlestick--an overturned candlestick. A moment\nlater, his hand encountered another object: a clock--one of those\nsmall traveling clocks, covered with leather.",
        "Well! What had happened? He could not understand. That\ncandlestick, that clock; why were those articles not in their\naccustomed placed? Ah! what had happened in the dread silence of\nthe night?",
        "Suddenly a cry escaped him. He had touched--oh! some strange,\nunutterable thing! “No! no!” he thought, “it cannot be. It is\nsome fantasy of my excited brain.” For twenty seconds, thirty\nseconds, he remained motionless, terrified, his forehead bathed\nwith perspiration, and his fingers still retained the sensation of\nthat dreadful contact.",
        "Making a desperate effort, he ventured to extend his arm again.\nOnce more, his hand encountered that strange, unutterable thing.\nHe felt it. He must feel it and find out what it is. He found\nthat it was hair, human hair, and a human face; and that face was\ncold, almost icy.",
        "However frightful the circumstances may be, a man like Arsene Lupin\ncontrols himself and commands the situation as soon as he learns\nwhat it is. So, Arsene Lupin quickly brought his lantern into use.\nA woman was lying before him, covered with blood. Her neck and\nshoulders were covered with gaping wounds. He leaned over her and\nmade a closer examination. She was dead.",
        "“Dead! Dead!” he repeated, with a bewildered air.",
        "He stared at those fixed eyes, that grim mouth, that livid flesh,\nand that blood--all that blood which had flowed over the carpet and\ncongealed there in thick, black spots. He arose and turned on the\nelectric lights. Then he beheld all the marks of a desperate\nstruggle. The bed was in a state of great disorder. One the\nfloor, the candlestick, and the clock, with the hands pointing to\ntwenty minutes after eleven; then, further away, an overturned\nchair; and, everywhere, there was blood, spots of blood and pools\nof blood.",
        "“And the black pearl?” he murmured.",
        "The box of letter-paper was in its place. He opened it, eagerly.\nThe jewel-case was there, but it was empty.",
        "“Fichtre!” he muttered. “You boasted of your good fortune much too\nsoon, my friend Lupin. With the countess lying cold and dead, and\nthe black pearl vanished, the situation is anything but pleasant.\nGet out of here as soon as you can, or you may get into serious\ntrouble.”",
        "Yet, he did not move.",
        "“Get out of here? Yes, of course. Any person would, except Arsene\nLupin. He has something better to do. Now, to proceed in an\norderly way. At all events, you have a clear conscience. Let us\nsuppose that you are the commissary of police and that you are\nproceeding to make an inquiry concerning this affair----Yes, but\nin order to do that, I require a clearer brain. Mine is muddled\nlike a ragout.”",
        "He tumbled into an armchair, with his clenched hands pressed\nagainst his burning forehead.",
        "The murder of the avenue Hoche is one of those which have recently\nsurprised and puzzled the Parisian public, and, certainly, I should\nnever have mentioned the affair if the veil of mystery had not been\nremoved by Arsene Lupin himself. No one knew the exact truth of\nthe case.",
        "Who did not know--from having met her in the Bois--the fair Leotine\nZalti, the once-famous cantatrice, wife and widow of the Count\nd’Andillot; the Zalti, whose luxury dazzled all Paris some twenty\nyears ago; the Zalti who acquired an European reputation for the\nmagnificence of her diamonds and pearls? It was said that she wore\nupon her shoulders the capital of several banking houses and the\ngold mines of numerous Australian companies. Skilful jewelers\nworked for Zelti as they had formerly wrought for kings and queens.\nAnd who does not remember the catastrophe in which all that wealth\nwas swallowed up? Of all that marvelous collection, nothing\nremained except the famous black pearl. The black pearl! That is\nto say a fortune, if she had wished to part with it.",
        "But she preferred to keep it, to live in a commonplace apartment\nwith her companion, her cook, and a man-servant, rather than sell\nthat inestimable jewel. There was a reason for it; a reason she\nwas not afraid to disclose: the black pearl was the gift of an\nemperor! Almost ruined, and reduced to the most mediocre\nexistence, she remained faithful to the companion of her happy and\nbrilliant youth. The black pearl never left her possession. She\nwore it during the day, and, at night, concealed it in a place\nknown to her alone.",
        "All these facts, being republished in the columns of the public\npress, served to stimulate curiosity; and, strange to say, but\nquite obvious to those who have the key to the mystery, the arrest\nof the presumed assassin only complicated the question and\nprolonged the excitement. Two days later, the newspapers published\nthe following item:",
        "“Information has reached us of the arrest of Victor Danegre, the\nservant of the Countess d’Andillot. The evidence against him is\nclear and convincing. On the silken sleeve of his liveried\nwaistcoat, which chief detective Dudouis found in his garret\nbetween the mattresses of his bed, several spots of blood were\ndiscovered. In addition, a cloth-covered button was missing from\nthat garment, and this button was found beneath the bed of the\nvictim.",
        "“It is supposed that, after dinner, in place of going to his own\nroom, Danegre slipped into the wardrobe-closet, and, through the\nglass door, had seen the countess hide the precious black pearl.\nThis is simply a theory, as yet unverified by any evidence. There\nis, also, another obscure point. At seven o’clock in the morning,\nDanegre went to the tobacco-shop on the Boulevard de Courcelles;\nthe concierge and the shop-keeper both affirm this fact. On the\nother hand, the countess’ companion and cook, who sleep at the end\nof the hall, both declare that, when they arose at eight o’clock,\nthe door of the antechamber and the door of the kitchen were\nlocked. These two persons have been in the service of the countess\nfor twenty years, and are above suspicion. The question is: How\ndid Danegre leave the apartment? Did he have another key? These\nare matters that the police will investigate.”",
        "As a matter of fact, the police investigation threw no light on the\nmystery. It was learned that Victor Danegre was a dangerous\ncriminal, a drunkard and a debauchee. But, as they proceeded with\nthe investigation, the mystery deepened and new complications\narose. In the first place, a young woman, Mlle. De Sincleves, the\ncousin and sole heiress of the countess, declared that the\ncountess, a month before her death, had written a letter to her and\nin it described the manner in which the black pearl was concealed.\nThe letter disappeared the day after she received it. Who had\nstolen it?",
        "Again, the concierge related how she had opened the door for a\nperson who had inquired for Doctor Harel. On being questioned, the\ndoctor testified that no one had rung his bell. Then who was that\nperson? And accomplice?",
        "The theory of an accomplice was thereupon adopted by the press and\npublic, and also by Ganimard, the famous detective.",
        "“Lupin is at the bottom of this affair,” he said to the judge.",
        "“Bah!” exclaimed the judge, “you have Lupin on the brain. You see\nhim everywhere.”",
        "“I see him everywhere, because he is everywhere.”",
        "“Say rather that you see him every time you encounter something you\ncannot explain. Besides, you overlook the fact that the crime was\ncommitted at twenty minutes past eleven in the evening, as is shown\nby the clock, while the nocturnal visit, mentioned by the\nconcierge, occurred at three o’clock in the morning.”",
        "Officers of the law frequently form a hasty conviction as to the\nguilt of a suspected person, and then distort all subsequent\ndiscoveries to conform to their established theory. The deplorable\nantecedents of Victor Danegre, habitual criminal, drunkard and\nrake, influenced the judge, and despite the fact that nothing new\nwas discovered in corroboration of the early clues, his official\nopinion remained firm and unshaken. He closed his investigation,\nand, a few weeks later, the trial commenced. It proved to be slow\nand tedious. The judge was listless, and the public prosecutor\npresented the case in a careless manner. Under those circumstances,\nDanegre’s counsel had an easy task. He pointed out the defects and\ninconsistencies of the case for the prosecution, and argued that the\nevidence was quite insufficient to convict the accused. Who had made\nthe key, the indispensable key without which Danegre, on leaving the\napartment, could not have locked the door behind him? Who had ever\nseen such a key, and what had become of it? Who had seen the\nassassin’s knife, and where is it now?",
        "“In any event,” argued the prisoner’s counsel, “the prosecution\nmust prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the prisoner\ncommitted the murder. The prosecution must show that the\nmysterious individual who entered the house at three o’clock in the\nmorning is not the guilty party. To be sure, the clock indicated\neleven o’clock. But what of that? I contend, that proves nothing.\nThe assassin could turn the hands of the clock to any hour he\npleased, and thus deceive us in regard to the exact hour of the\ncrime.”",
        "Victor Danegre was acquitted.",
        "He left the prison on Friday about dusk in the evening, weak and\ndepressed by his six months’ imprisonment. The inquisition, the\nsolitude, the trial, the deliberations of the jury, combined to\nfill him with a nervous fear. At night, he had been afflicted with\nterrible nightmares and haunted by weird visions of the scaffold.\nHe was a mental and physical wreck.",
        "Under the assumed name of Anatole Dufour, he rented a small room on\nthe heights of Montmartre, and lived by doing odd jobs wherever he\ncould find them. He led a pitiful existence. Three times, he\nobtained regular employment, only to be recognized and then\ndischarged. Sometimes, he had an idea that men were following him--\ndetectives, no doubt, who were seeking to trap and denounce him.\nHe could almost feel the strong hand of the law clutching him by\nthe collar.",
        "One evening, as he was eating his dinner at a neighboring\nrestaurant, a man entered and took a seat at the same table. He\nwas a person about forty years of age, and wore a frock-coat of\ndoubtful cleanliness. He ordered soup, vegetables, and a bottle of\nwine. After he had finished his soup, he turned his eyes on\nDanegre, and gazed at him intently. Danegre winced. He was\ncertain that this was one of the men who had been following him for\nseveral weeks. What did he want? Danegre tried to rise, but\nfailed. His limbs refused to support him. The man poured himself\na glass of wine, and then filled Danegre’s glass. The man raised\nhis glass, and said:",
        "“To your health, Victor Danegre.”",
        "Victor started in alarm, and stammered:",
        "“I!....I!....no, no....I sweat to you....”",
        "“You will swear what? That you are not yourself? The servant of\nthe countess?”",
        "“What servant? My name is Dufour. Ask the proprietor.”",
        "“Yes, Anatole Dufour to the proprietor of this restaurant, but\nVictor Danegre to the officers of the law.”",
        "“That’s not true! Some one has lied to you.”",
        "The new-comer took a card from his pocket and handed it to Victor,\nwho read on it: “Grimaudan, ex-inspector of the detective force.\nPrivate business transacted.” Victor shuddered as he said:",
        "“You are connected with the police?”",
        "“No, not now, but I have a liking for the business and I continue\nto work at it in a manner more--profitable. From time to time I\nstrike upon a golden opportunity--such as your case presents.”",
        "“My case?”",
        "“Yes, yours. I assure you it is a most promising affair, provided\nyou are inclined to be reasonable.”",
        "“But if I am not reasonable?”",
        "“Oh! my good fellow, you are not in a position to refuse me\nanything I may ask.”",
        "“What is it....you want?” stammered Victor, fearfully.",
        "“Well, I will inform you in a few words. I am sent by Mademoiselle\nde Sincleves, the heiress of the Countess d’Andillot.”",
        "“What for?”",
        "“To recover the black pearl.”",
        "“Black pearl?”",
        "“That you stole.”",
        "“But I haven’t got it.”",
        "“You have it.”",
        "“If I had, then I would be the assassin.”",
        "“You are the assassin.”",
        "Danegre showed a forced smile.",
        "“Fortunately for me, monsieur, the Assizecourt was not of your\nopinion. The jury returned an unanimous verdict of acquittal. And\nwhen a man had a clear conscience and twelve good men in his favor--\n”",
        "The ex-inspector seized him by the arm and said:",
        "“No fine phrases, my boy. Now, listen to me and weigh my words\ncarefully. You will find they are worthy of your consideration.\nNow, Danegre, three weeks before the murder, you abstracted the\ncook’s key to the servants’ door, and had a duplicate key made by a\nlocksmith named Outard, 244 rue Oberkampf.”",
        "“It’s a lie--it’s a lie!” growled Victor. “No person has seen that\nkey. There is no such key.”",
        "“Here it is.”",
        "After a silence, Grimaudan continued:",
        "“You killed the countess with a knife purchased by you at the Bazar\nde la Republique on the same day as you ordered the duplicate key.\nIt has a triangular blade with a groove running from end to end.”",
        "“That is all nonsense. You are simply guessing at something you\ndon’t know. No one ever saw the knife.”",
        "“Here it is.”",
        "Victor Danegre recoiled. The ex-inspector continued:",
        "“There are some spots of rust upon it. Shall I tell you how they\ncame there?”",
        "“Well!....you have a key and a knife. Who can prove that they\nbelong to me?”",
        "“The locksmith, and the clerk from whom you bought the knife. I\nhave already refreshed their memories, and, when you confront them,\nthey cannot fail to recognize you.”",
        "His speech was dry and hard, with a tone of firmness and precision.\nDanegre was trembling with fear, and yet he struggled desperately\nto maintain an air of indifference.",
        "“Is that all the evidence you have?”",
        "“Oh! no, not at all. I have plenty more. For instance, after the\ncrime, you went out the same way you had entered. But, in the\ncentre of the wardrobe-room, being seized by some sudden fear, you\nleaned against the wall for support.”",
        "“How do you know that? No one could know such a thing,” argues the\ndesperate man.",
        "“The police know nothing about it, of course. They never think of\nlighting a candle and examining the walls. But if they had done\nso, they would have found on the white plaster a faint red spot,\nquite distinct, however, to trace in it the imprint of your thumb\nwhich you had pressed against the wall while it was wet with blood.\nNow, as you are well aware, under the Bertillon system, thumb-marks\nare one of the principal means of identification.”",
        "Victor Danegre was livid; great drops of perspiration rolled down\nhis face and fell upon the table. He gazed, with a wild look, at\nthe strange man who had narrated the story of his crime as\nfaithfully as if he had been an invisible witness to it. Overcome\nand powerless, Victor bowed his head. He felt that it was useless\nto struggle against this marvelous man. So he said:",
        "“How much will you give me, if I give you the pearl?”",
        "“Nothing.”",
        "“Oh! you are joking! Or do you mean that I should give you an\narticle worth thousands and hundreds of thousands and get nothing\nin return?”",
        "“You will get your life. Is that nothing?”",
        "The unfortunate man shuddered. Then Grimaudan added, in a milder\ntone:",
        "“Come, Danegre, that pearl has no value in your hands. It is quite\nimpossible for you to sell it; so what is the use of your keeping\nit?”",
        "“There are pawnbrokers....and, some day, I will be able to get\nsomething for it.”",
        "“But that day may be too late.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Because by that time you may be in the hands of the police, and,\nwith the evidence that I can furnish--the knife, the key, the thumb-\nmark--what will become of you?”",
        "Victor rested his head on his hands and reflected. He felt that he\nwas lost, irremediably lost, and, at the same time, a sense of\nweariness and depression overcame him. He murmured, faintly:",
        "“When must I give it to you?”",
        "“To-night---within an hour.”",
        "“If I refuse?”",
        "“If you refuse, I shall post this letter to the Procureur of the\nRepublic; in which letter Mademoiselle de Sincleves denounces you\nas the assassin.”",
        "Danegre poured out two glasses of wine which he drank in rapid\nsuccession, then, rising, said:",
        "“Pay the bill, and let us go. I have had enough of the cursed\naffair.”",
        "Night had fallen. The two men walked down the rue Lepic and\nfollowed the exterior boulevards in the direction of the Place de\nl’Etoile. They pursued their way in silence; Victor had a stooping\ncarriage and a dejected face. When they reached the Parc Monceau,\nhe said:",
        "“We are near the house.”",
        "“Parbleu! You only left the house once, before your arrest, and\nthat was to go to the tobacco-shop.”",
        "“Here it is,” said Danegre, in a dull voice.",
        "They passed along the garden wall of the countess’ house, and\ncrossed a street on a corner of which stood the tobacco-shop. A\nfew steps further on, Danegre stopped; his limbs shook beneath him,\nand he sank to a bench.",
        "“Well! what now?” demanded his companion.",
        "“It is there.”",
        "“Where? Come, now, no nonsense!”",
        "“There--in front of us.”",
        "“Where?”",
        "“Between two paving-stones.”",
        "“Which?”",
        "“Look for it.”",
        "“Which stones?”",
        "Victor made no reply.",
        "“Ah; I see!” exclaimed Grimaudan, “you want me to pay for the\ninformation.”",
        "“No....but....I am afraid I will starve to death.”",
        "“So! that is why you hesitate. Well, I’ll not be hard on you. How\nmuch do you want?”",
        "“Enough to buy a steerage pass to America.”",
        "“All right.”",
        "“And a hundred francs to keep me until I get work there.”",
        "“You shall have two hundred. Now, speak.”",
        "“Count the paving-stones to the right from the sewer-hole. The\npearl is between the twelfth and thirteenth.”",
        "“In the gutter?”",
        "“Yes, close to the sidewalk.”",
        "Grimaudan glanced around to see if anyone were looking. Some tram-\ncars and pedestrians were passing. But, bah, they will not suspect\nanything. He opened his pocketknife and thrust it between the\ntwelfth and thirteenth stones.",
        "“And if it is not there?” he said to Victor.",
        "“It must be there, unless someone saw me stoop down and hide it.”",
        "Could it be possible that the back pearl had been cast into the mud\nand filth of the gutter to be picked up by the first comer? The\nblack pearl--a fortune!",
        "“How far down?” he asked.",
        "“About ten centimetres.”",
        "He dug up the wet earth. The point of his knife struck something.\nHe enlarged the hole with his finger. Then he abstracted the black\npearl from its filthy hiding-place.",
        "“Good! Here are your two hundred francs. I will send you the\nticket for America.”",
        "On the following day, this article was published in the `Echo de\nFrance,’ and was copied by the leading newspapers throughout the\nworld:",
        " “Yesterday, the famous black pearl came into the possession of\n Arsene Lupin, who recovered it from the murderer of the Countess\n d’Andillot. In a short time, fac-similes of that precious jewel\n will be exhibited in London, St. Petersburg, Calcutta, Buenos Ayres\n and New York.",
        " “Arsene Lupin will be pleased to consider all propositions\n submitted to him through his agents.”",
        "“And that is how crime is always punished and virtue rewarded,\"\nsaid Arsene Lupin, after he had told me the foregoing history of\nthe black pearl.",
        "“And that is how you, under the assumed name of Grimaudan,\nex-inspector of detectives, were chosen by fate to deprive the\ncriminal of the benefit of his crime.”",
        "“Exactly. And I confess that the affair gives me infinite\nsatisfaction and pride. The forty minutes that I passed in the\napartment of the Countess d’Andillot, after learning of her death,\nwere the most thrilling and absorbing moments of my life. In those\nforty minutes, involved as I was in a most dangerous plight, I\ncalmly studied the scene of the murder and reached the conclusion\nthat the crime must have been committed by one of the house\nservants. I also decided that, in order to get the pearl, that\nservant must be arrested, and so I left the wainscoat button; it\nwas necessary, also, for me to hold some convincing evidence of his\nguilt, so I carried away the knife which I found upon the floor,\nand the key which I found in the lock. I closed and locked the\ndoor, and erased the finger-marks from the plaster in the wardrobe-\ncloset. In my opinion, that was one of those flashes--”",
        "“Of genius,” I said, interrupting.",
        "“Of genius, if you wish. But, I flatter myself, it would not have\noccurred to the average mortal. To frame, instantly, the two\nelements of the problem--an arrest and an acquittal; to make use of\nthe formidable machinery of the law to crush and humble my victim,\nand reduce him to a condition in which, when free, he would be\ncertain to fall into the trap I was laying for him!”",
        "“Poor devil--”",
        "“Poor devil, do you say? Victor Danegre, the assassin! He might\nhave descended to the lowest depths of vice and crime, if he had\nretained the black pearl. Now, he lives! Think of that: Victor\nDanegre is alive!”",
        "“And you have the black pearl.”",
        "He took it out of one of the secret pockets of his wallet, examined\nit, gazed at it tenderly, and caressed it with loving fingers, and\nsighed, as he said:",
        "“What cold Russian prince, what vain and foolish rajah may some day\npossess this priceless treasure! Or, perhaps, some American\nmillionaire is destined to become the owner of this morsel of\nexquisite beauty that once adorned the fair bosom of Leontine\nZalti, the Countess d’Andillot.”",
        "It is really remarkable, Velmont, what a close resemblance you bear\nto Arsene Lupin!”",
        "“How do you know?”",
        "“Oh! like everyone else, from photographs, no two of which are\nalike, but each of them leaves the impression of a face....\nsomething like yours.”",
        "Horace Velmont displayed some vexation.",
        "“Quite so, my dear Devanne. And, believe me, you are not the first\none who has noticed it.”",
        "“It is so striking,” persisted Devanne, “that if you had not been\nrecommended to me by my cousin d’Estevan, and if you were not the\ncelebrated artist whose beautiful marine views I so admire, I have\nno doubt I should have warned the police of your presence in\nDieppe.”",
        "This sally was greeted with an outburst of laughter. The large\ndining-hall of the Chateau de Thibermesnil contained on this\noccasion, besides Valmont, the following guests: Father Gelis, the\nparish priest, and a dozen officers whose regiments were quartered\nin the vicinity and who had accepted the invitation of the banker\nGeorges Devanne and his mother. One of the officers then remarked:",
        "“I understand that an exact description of Arsene Lupin has been\nfurnished to all the police along this coast since his daring\nexploit on the Paris-Havre express.”",
        "“I suppose so,” said Devanne. “That was three months ago; and a\nweek later, I made the acquaintance of our friend Velmont at the\ncasino, and, since then, he has honored me with several visits--an\nagreeable preamble to a more serious visit that he will pay me one\nof these days--or, rather, one of these nights.”",
        "This speech evoked another round of laughter, and the guests then\npassed into the ancient “Hall of the Guards,” a vast room with a\nhigh ceiling, which occupied the entire lower part of the Tour\nGuillaume--William’s Tower--and wherein Georges Devanne had collected\nthe incomparable treasures which the lords of Thibermesnil had\naccumulated through many centuries. It contained ancient chests,\ncredences, andirons and chandeliers. The stone walls were overhung\nwith magnificent tapestries. The deep embrasures of the four\nwindows were furnished with benches, and the Gothic windows were\ncomposed of small panes of colored glass set in a leaden frame.\nBetween the door and the window to the left stood an immense\nbookcase of Renaissance style, on the pediment of which, in letters\nof gold, was the world “Thibermesnil,” and, below it, the proud\nfamily device: “Fais ce que veulx” (Do what thou wishest). When\nthe guests had lighted their cigars, Devanne resumed the\nconversation.",
        "“And remember, Velmont, you have no time to lose; in fact, to-night\nis the last chance you will have.”",
        "“How so?” asked the painter, who appeared to regard the affair as a\njoke. Devanne was about to reply, when his mother mentioned to him\nto keep silent, but the excitement of the occasion and a desire to\ninterest his guests urged him to speak.",
        "“Bah!” he murmured. “I can tell it now. It won’t do any harm.”",
        "The guests drew closer, and he commenced to speak with the\nsatisfied air of a man who has an important announcement to make.",
        "“To-morrow afternoon at four o’clock, Sherlock Holmes, the famous\nEnglish detective, for whom such a thing as mystery does not exist;\nSherlock Holmes, the most remarkable solver of enigmas the world\nhas ever known, that marvelous man who would seem to be the\ncreation of a romantic novelist--Sherlock Holmes will be my guest!”",
        "Immediately, Devanne was the target of numerous eager questions.\n\"Is Sherlock Holmes really coming?” “Is it so serious as that?\"\n\"Is Arsene Lupin really in this neighborhood?”",
        "“Arsene Lupin ad his bad are not far away. Besides the robbery of\nthe Baron Cahorn, he is credited with the thefts at Montigny,\nGruchet and Crasville.”",
        "“Has he sent you a warning, as he did to Baron Cahorn?”",
        "“No,” replied Devanne, “he can’t work the same trick twice.”",
        "“What then?”",
        "“I will show you.”",
        "He rose, and pointing to a small empty space between the two\nenormous folios on one of the shelves of the bookcase, he said:",
        "“There used to be a book there--a book of the sixteenth century\nentitled `Chronique de Thibermesnil,’ which contained the history\nof the castle since its construction by Duke Rollo on the site of a\nformer feudal fortress. There were three engraved plates in the\nbook; one of which was a general view of the whole estate; another,\nthe plan of the buildings; and the third--I call your attention to\nit, particularly--the third was the sketch of a subterranean\npassage, on entrance to which is outside the first line of\nramparts, while the other end of the passage is here, in this very\nroom. Well, that book disappeared a month ago.”",
        "“The deuce!” said Velmont, “that looks bad. But it doesn’t seem to\nbe a sufficient reason for sending for Sherlock Holmes.”",
        "“Certainly, that was not sufficient in itself, but another incident\nhappened that gives the disappearance of the book a special\nsignificance. There was another cop of this book in the National\nLibrary at Paris, and the two books differed in certain details\nrelating to the subterranean passage; for instance, each of them\ncontained drawings and annotations, not printed, but written in ink\nand more or less effaced. I knew those facts, and I knew that the\nexact location of the passage could be determined only by a\ncomparison of the two books. Now, the day after my book\ndisappeared, the book was called for in the National Library by a\nreader who carried it away, and no one knows how the theft was\neffected.”",
        "The guests uttered many exclamations of surprise.",
        "“Certainly, the affair looks serious,” said one.",
        "“Well, the police investigated the matter, and, as usual,\ndiscovered no clue whatever.”",
        "“They never do, when Arsene Lupin is concerned in it.”",
        "“Exactly; and so I decided to ask the assistance of Sherlock\nHolmes, who replied that he was ready and anxious to enter the\nlists with Arsene Lupin.”",
        "“What glory for Arsene Lupin!” said Velmont. “But if our national\nthief, as they call him, has no evil designs on your castle,\nSherlock Holmes will have his trip in vain.”",
        "“There are other things that will interest him, such as the\ndiscovery of the subterranean passage.”",
        "“But you told us that one end of the passage was outside the\nramparts and the other was in this very room!”",
        "“Yes, but in what part of the room? The line which represents the\npassage on the charts ends here, with a small circle marked with\nthe letters `T.G.,’ which no doubt stand for `Tour Guillaume.’ But\nthe tower is round, and who can tell the exact spot at which the\npassage touches the tower?”",
        "Devanne lighted a second cigar and poured himself a glass of\nBenedictine. His guests pressed him with questions and he was\npleased to observe the interest that his remarks had created. The\nhe continued:",
        "“The secret is lost. No one knows it. The legend is to the effect\nthat the former lords of the castle transmitted the secret from\nfather to son on their deathbeds, until Geoffroy, the last of the\nrace, was beheaded during the Revolution in his nineteenth year.”",
        "“That is over a century ago. Surely, someone has looked for it\nsince that time?”",
        "“Yes, but they failed to find it. After I purchased the castle, I\nmade a diligent search for it, but without success. You must\nremember that this tower is surrounded by water and connected with\nthe castle only by a bridge; consequently, the passage must be\nunderneath the old moat. The plan that was in the book in the\nNational Library showed a series of stairs with a total of forty-\neight steps, which indicates a depth of more than ten meters. You\nsee, the mystery lies within the walls of this room, and yet I\ndislike to tear them down.”",
        "“Is there nothing to show where it is?”",
        "“Nothing.”",
        "“Mon. Devanne, we should turn our attention to the two quotations,\"\nsuggested Father Gelis.",
        "“Oh!” exclaimed Mon. Devanne, laughing, “our worthy father is fond\nof reading memoirs and delving into the musty archives of the\ncastle. Everything relating to Thibermesnil interests him greatly.\nBut the quotations that he mentions only serve to complicate the\nmystery. He has read somewhere that two kings of France have known\nthe key to the puzzle.”",
        "“Two kings of France! Who were they?”",
        "“Henry the Fourth and Louis the Sixteenth. And the legend runs\nlike this: On the eve of the battle of Arques, Henry the Fourth\nspent the night in this castle. At eleven o’clock in the evening,\nLouise de Tancarville, the prettiest woman in Normandy, was brought\ninto the castle through the subterranean passage by Duke Edgard,\nwho, at the same time, informed the king of the secret passage.\nAfterward, the king confided the secret to his minister Sully, who,\nin turn, relates the story in his book, “Royales Economies d’Etat,\"\nwithout making any comment upon it, but linking with it this\nincomprehensible sentence: `Turn one eye on the bee that shakes,\nthe other eye will lead to God!’”",
        "After a brief silence, Velmont laughed and said:",
        "“Certainly, it doesn’t throw a dazzling light upon the subject.”",
        "“No; but Father Gelis claims that Sully concealed the key to the\nmystery in this strange sentence in order to keep the secret from\nthe secretaries to whom he dictated his memoirs.”",
        "“That is an ingenious theory,” said Velmont.",
        "“Yes, and it may be nothing more; I cannot see that it throws any\nlight on the mysterious riddle.”",
        "“And was it also to receive the visit of a lady that Louis the\nSixteenth caused the passage to be opened?”",
        "“I don’t know,” said Mon. Devanne. All I can say is that the king\nstopped here one night in 1784, and that the famous Iron Casket\nfound in the Louvre contained a paper bearing these words in the\nking’s own writing: `Thibermesnil 3-4-11.’”",
        "Horace Velmont laughed heartily, and exclaimed:",
        "“At last! And now that we have the magic key, where is the man who\ncan fit it to the invisible lock?”",
        "“Laugh as much as you please, monsieur,” said Father Gelis, “but I\nam confident the solution is contained in those two sentences, and\nsome day we will find a man able to interpret them.”",
        "“Sherlock Holmes is the man,” said Mon. Devanne, “unless Arsene\nLupin gets ahead of him. What is your opinion, Velmont?”",
        "Velmont arose, placed his hand on Devanne’s shoulder, and declared:",
        "“I think that the information furnished by your book and the book\nof the National Library was deficient in a very important detail\nwhich you have now supplied. I thank you for it.”",
        "“What is it?”",
        "“The missing key. Now that I have it, I can go to work at once,\"\nsaid Velmont.",
        "“Of course; without losing a minute,” said Devanne, smiling.",
        "“Not even a second!” replied Velmont. “To-night, before the\narrival of Sherlock Holmes, I must plunder your castle.”",
        "“You have no time to lose. Oh! by the way, I can drive you over\nthis evening.”",
        "“To Dieppe?”",
        "“Yes. I am going to meet Monsieur and Madame d’Androl and a young\nlady of their acquaintance who are to arrive by the midnight\ntrain.”",
        "Then addressing the officers, Devanne added:",
        "“Gentlemen, I shall expect to see all of you at breakfast to-\nmorrow.”",
        "The invitation was accepted. The company dispersed, and a few\nmoments later Devanne and Velmont were speeding toward Dieppe in an\nautomobile. Devanne dropped the artist in front of the Casino, and\nproceeded to the railway station. At twelve o’clock his friends\nalighted from the train. A half hour later the automobile was at\nthe entrance to the castle. At one o’clock, after a light supper,\nthey retired. The lights were extinguished, and the castle was\nenveloped in the darkness and silence of the night.",
        "The moon appeared through a rift in the clouds, and filled the\ndrawing-room with its bright white light. But only for a moment.\nThen the moon again retired behind its ethereal draperies, and\ndarkness and silence reigned supreme. No sound could be heard,\nsave the monotonous ticking of the clock. It struck two, and then\ncontinued its endless repetitions of the seconds. Then, three\no’clock.",
        "Suddenly, something clicked, like the opening and closing of a\nsignal-disc that warns the passing train. A thin stream of light\nflashed to every corner of the room, like an arrow that leaved\nbehind it a trail of light. It shot forth from the central fluting\nof a column that supported the pediment of the bookcase. It rested\nfor a moment on the panel opposite like a glittering circle of\nburnished silver, then flashed in all directions like a guilty eye\nthat scrutinizes every shadow. It disappeared for a short time,\nbur burst forth again as a whole section of the bookcase revolved\non a picot and disclosed a large opening like a vault.",
        "A man entered, carrying an electric lantern. He was followed by a\nsecond man, who carried a coil of rope and various tools. The\nleader inspected the room, listened a moment, and said:\nA man entered, carrying an electric lantern. He was followed by a\nsecond man, who carried a coil of rope and various tools. The\nleader inspected the room, listened a moment, and said:",
        "“Call the others.”",
        "Then eight men, stout fellows with resolute faces, entered the\nroom, and immediately commenced to remove the furnishings. Arsene\nLupin passed quickly from one piece of furniture to another,\nexamined each, and, according to its size or artistic value, he\ndirected his men to take it or leave it. If ordered to be taken,\nit was carried to the gaping mouth of the tunnel, and ruthlessly\nthrust into the bowels of the earth. Such was the fate of six\narmchairs, six small Louis XV chairs, a quantity of Aubusson\ntapestries, some candelabra, paintings by Fragonard and Nattier, a\nbust by Houdon, and some statuettes. Sometimes, Lupin would linger\nbefore a beautiful chest or a superb picture, and sigh:",
        "“That is too heavy....too large....what a pity!”",
        "In forty minutes the room was dismantled; and it had been\naccomplished in such an orderly manner and with as little noise as\nif the various articles had been packed and wadded for the\noccasion.",
        "Lupin said to the last man who departed by way of the tunnel:",
        "“You need not come back. You understand, that as soon as the auto-\nvan is loaded, you are to proceed to the grange at Roquefort.”",
        "“But you, patron?”",
        "“Leave me the motor-cycle.”",
        "When the mad had disappeared, Arsene Lupin pushed the section of\nthe bookcase back into its place, carefully effaced the traces of\nthe men’s footsteps, raised a portiere, and entered a gallery,\nwhich was the only means of communication between the tower and the\ncastle. In the center of this gallery there was a glass cabinet\nwhich had attracted Lupin’s attentions. It contained a valuable\ncollection of watches, snuff-boxes, rings, chatelaines and\nminiatures of rare and beautiful workmanship. He forced the lock\nwith a small jimmy, and experienced a great pleasure in handling\nthose gold and silver ornaments, those exquisite and delicate works\nof art.",
        "He carried a large linen bag, specially prepared for the removal of\nsuch knick-knacks. He filled it. Then he filled the pockets of\nhis coat, waistcoat and trousers. And he was just placing over his\nleft arm a number of pearl reticules when he heard a slight sound.\nHe listened. No, he was not deceived. The noise continued. Then\nhe remembered that, at one end of the gallery, there was a stairway\nleading to an unoccupied apartment, but which was probably occupied\nthat night by the young lady whom Mon. Devanne had brought from\nDieppe with his other visitors.",
        "Immediately he extinguished his lantern, and had scarcely gained\nthe friendly shelter of a window-embrasure, when the door at the\ntop of the stairway was opened and a feeble light illuminated the\ngallery. He could feel--for, concealed by a curtain, he could not\nsee--that a woman was cautiously descending the upper steps of the\nstairs. He hoped she would come no closer. Yet, she continued to\ndescend, and even advanced some distance into the room. Then she\nuttered a faint cry. No doubt she had discovered the broken and\ndismantled cabinet.",
        "She advanced again. Now he could smell the perfume, and hear the\nthrobbing of her heart as she drew closer to the window where he\nwas concealed. She passed so close that her skirt brushed against\nthe window-curtain, and Lupin felt that she suspected the presence\nof another, behind her, in the shadow, within reach of her hand.\nHe thought: “She is afraid. She will go away.” But she did not\ngo. The candle, that she carried in her trembling hand, grew\nbrighter. She turned, hesitated a moment, appeared to listen, then\nsuddenly drew aside the curtain.",
        "They stood face to face. Arsene was astounded. He murmured,\ninvoluntarily:",
        "“You--you--mademoiselle.”",
        "It was Miss Nelly. Miss Nelly! his fellow passenger on the\ntransatlantic steamer, who had been the subject of his dreams on\nthat memorable voyage, who had been a witness to his arrest, and\nwho, rather than betray him, had dropped into the water the kodak\nin which he had concealed the bank-notes and diamonds. Miss Nelly!\nthat charming creature, the memory of whose face has sometimes\nsheered, sometimes saddened the long hours of imprisonment.",
        "It was such an unexpected encounter that brought them face to face\nin that castle at that hour of the night, that they could not move,\nnor utter a word; they were amazed, hypnotized, each at the sudden\napparition of the other. Trembling with emotion, Miss Nelly\nstaggered to a seat. He remained standing in front of her.",
        "Gradually, he realized the situation and conceived the impression\nhe must have produced at that moment with his arms laden with\nknick-knacks, and his pockets and a linen sack overflowing with\nplunder. He was overcome with confusion, and he actually blushed\nto find himself in the position of a thief caught in the act. To\nher, henceforth, he was a thief, a man who puts his hand in\nanother’s pocket, who steals into houses and robs people while they\nsleep.",
        "A watch fell upon the floor; then another. These were followed by\nother articles which slipped from his grasp one by one. Then,\nactuated by a sudden decision, he dropped the other articles into\nan armchair, emptied his pockets and unpacked his sack. He felt\nvery uncomfortable in Nelly’s presence, and stepped toward her with\nthe intention of speaking to her, but she shuddered, rose quickly\nand fled toward the salon. The portiere closed behind her. He\nfollowed her. She was standing trembling and amazed at the sight\nof the devastated room. He said to her, at once:",
        "“To-morrow, at three o’clock, everything will be returned. The\nfurniture will be brought back.”",
        "She made no reply, so he repeated:",
        "“I promise it. To-morrow, at three o’clock. Nothing in the world\ncould induce me to break that promise....To-morrow, at three\no’clock.”",
        "Then followed a long silence that he dared not break, whilst the\nagitation of the young girl caused him a feeling of genuine regret.\nQuietly, without a word, he turned away, thinking: “I hope she will\ngo away. I can’t endure her presence.” But the young girl\nsuddenly spoke, and stammered:",
        "“Listen....footsteps....I hear someone....”",
        "He looked at her with astonishment. She seemed to be overwhelmed\nby the thought of approaching peril.",
        "“I don’t hear anything,” he said.",
        "“But you must go--you must escape!”",
        "“Why should I go?”",
        "“Because--you must. Oh! do not remain here another minute. Go!”",
        "She ran, quickly, to the door leading to the gallery and listened.\nNo, there was no one there. Perhaps the noise was outside. She\nwaited a moment, then returned reassured.",
        "But Arsene Lupin had disappeared.",
        "As soon as Mon. Devanne was informed of the pillage of his castle,\nhe said to himself: It was Velmont who did it, and Velmont is\nArsene Lupin. That theory explained everything, and there was no\nother plausible explanation. And yet the idea seemed preposterous.\nIt was ridiculous to suppose that Velmont was anyone else than\nVelmont, the famous artist, and club-fellow of his cousin\nd’Estevan. So, when the captain of the gendarmes arrived to\ninvestigate the affair, Devanne did not even think of mentioning\nhis absurd theory.",
        "Throughout the forenoon there was a lively commotion at the castle.\nThe gendarmes, the local police, the chief of police from Dieppe,\nthe villagers, all circulated to and fro in the halls, examining\nevery nook and corner that was open to their inspection. The\napproach of the maneuvering troops, the rattling fire of the\nmusketry, added to the picturesque character of the scene.",
        "The preliminary search furnished no clue. Neither the doors nor\nwindows showed any signs of having been disturbed. Consequently,\nthe removal of the goods must have been effected by means of the\nsecret passage. Yet, there were no indications of footsteps on the\nfloor, nor any unusual marks upon the walls.",
        "Their investigations revealed, however, one curious fact that\ndenoted the whimsical character of Arsene Lupin: the famous\nChronique of the sixteenth century had been restored to its\naccustomed place in the library and, beside it, there was a similar\nbook, which was none other than the volume stolen from the National\nLibrary.",
        "At eleven o’clock the military officers arrived. Devanne welcomed\nthem with his usual gayety; for, no matter how much chagrin he\nmight suffer from the loss of his artistic treasures, his great\nwealth enabled him to bear his loss philosophically. His guests,\nMonsieur and Madame d’Androl and Miss Nelly, were introduced; and\nit was then noticed that one of the expected guests had not\narrived. It was Horace Velmont. Would he come? His absence had\nawakened the suspicions of Mon. Devanne. But at twelve o’clock he\narrived. Devanne exclaimed:",
        "“Ah! here you are!”",
        "“Why, am I not punctual?” asked Velmont.",
        "“Yes, and I am surprised that you are....after such a busy night!\nI suppose you know the news?”",
        "“What news?”",
        "“You have robbed the castle.”",
        "“Nonsense!” exclaimed Velmont, smiling.",
        "“Exactly as I predicted. But, first escort Miss Underdown to the\ndining-room. Mademoiselle, allow me--”",
        "He stopped, as he remarked the extreme agitation of the young girl.\nThen, recalling the incident, he said:",
        "“Ah! of course, you met Arsene Lupin on the steamer, before his\narrest, and you are astonished at the resemblance. Is that it?”",
        "She did not reply. Velmont stood before her, smiling. He bowed.\nShe took his proffered arm. He escorted her to her place, and took\nhis seat opposite her. During the breakfast, the conversation\nrelated exclusively to Arsene Lupin, the stolen goods, the secret\npassage, and Sherlock Holmes. It was only at the close of the\nrepast, when the conversation had drifted to other subjects, that\nVelmont took any part in it. Then he was, by turns, amusing and\ngrave, talkative and pensive. And all his remarks seemed to be\ndirected to the young girl. But she, quite absorbed, did not\nappear to hear them.",
        "Coffee was served on the terrace overlooking the court of honor and\nthe flower garden in front of the principal facade. The regimental\nband played on the lawn, and scores of soldiers and peasants\nwandered through the park.",
        "Miss Nelly had not forgotten, for one moment, Lupin’s solemn\npromise: “To-morrow, at three o’clock, everything will be\nreturned.”",
        "At three o’clock! And the hands of the great clock in the right\nwing of the castle now marked twenty minutes to three. In spite of\nherself, her eyes wandered to the clock every minute. She also\nwatched Velmont, who was calmly swinging to and fro in a\ncomfortable rocking chair.",
        "Ten minutes to three!....Five minutes to three!....Nelly was\nimpatient and anxious. Was it possible that Arsene Lupin would\ncarry out his promise at the appointed hour, when the castle, the\ncourtyard, and the park were filled with people, and at the very\nmoment when the officers of the law were pursuing their\ninvestigations? And yet....Arsene Lupin had given her his solemn\npromise. “It will be exactly as he said,” thought she, so deeply\nwas she impressed with the authority, energy and assurance of that\nremarkable man. To her, it no longer assumed the form of a\nmiracle, but, on the contrary, a natural incident that must occur\nin the ordinary course of events. She blushed, and turned her\nhead.",
        "Three o’clock! The great clock struck slowly:\none....two....three....Horace Velmont took out his watch, glanced\nat the clock, then returned the watch to his pocket. A few seconds\npassed in silence; and then the crowd in the courtyard parted to\ngive passage to two wagons, that had just entered the park-gate,\neach drawn by two horses. They were army-wagons, such as are used\nfor the transportation of provisions, tents, and other necessary\nmilitary stores. They stopped in front of the main entrance, and a\ncommissary-sergeant leaped from one of the wagons and inquired for\nMon. Devanne. A moment later, that gentleman emerged from the\nhouse, descended the steps, and, under the canvas covers of the\nwagons, beheld his furniture, pictures and ornaments carefully\npackaged and arranged.",
        "When questioned, the sergeant produced an order that he had\nreceived from the officer of the day. By that order, the second\ncompany of the fourth battalion were commanded to proceed to the\ncrossroads of Halleux in the forest of Arques, gather up the\nfurniture and other articles deposited there, and deliver same to\nMonsieur Georges Devanne, owner of the Thibermesnil castle, at\nthree o’clock. Signed: Col. Beauvel.",
        "“At the crossroads,” explained the sergeant, “we found everything\nready, lying on the grass, guarded by some passers-by. It seemed\nvery strange, but the order was imperative.”",
        "One of the officers examined the signature. He declared it a\nforgery; but a clever imitation. The wagons were unloaded, and the\ngoods restored to their proper placed in the castle.",
        "During this commotion, Nelly had remained alone at the extreme end\nof the terrace, absorbed by confused and distracted thoughts.\nSuddenly, she observed Velmont approaching her. She would have\navoided him, but the balustrade that surrounded the terrace cut off\nher retreat. She was cornered. She could not move. A gleam of\nsunshine, passing through the scant foliage of a bamboo, lighted up\nher beautiful golden hair. Some one spoke to her in a low voice:",
        "“Have I not kept my promise?”",
        "Arsene Lupin stood close to her. No one else was near. He\nrepeated, in a calm, soft voice:",
        "“Have I not kept my promise?”",
        "He expected a word of thanks, or at least some slight movement that\nwould betray her interest in the fulfillment of his promise. But\nshe remained silent.",
        "Her scornful attitude annoyed Arsene Lupin; and he realized the\nvast distance that separated him from Miss Nelly, now that she had\nlearned the truth. He would gladly have justified himself in her\neyes, or at least pleaded extenuating circumstances, but he\nperceived the absurdity and futility of such an attempt. Finally,\ndominated by a surging flood of memories, he murmured:",
        "“Ah! how long ago that was! You remember the long hours on the\ndeck of the `Provence.’ Then, you carried a rose in your hand, a\nwhite rose like the one you carry to-day. I asked you for it. You\npretended you did not hear me. After you had gone away, I found\nthe rose--forgotten, no doubt--and I kept it.”",
        "She made no reply. She seemed to be far away. He continued:",
        "“In memory of those happy hours, forget what you have learned\nsince. Separate the past from the present. Do not regard me as\nthe man you saw last night, but look at me, if only for a moment,\nas you did in those far-off days when I was Bernard d’Andrezy, for\na short time. Will you, please?”",
        "She raised her eyes and looked at him as he had requested. Then,\nwithout saying a word, she pointed to a ring he was wearing on his\nforefinger. Only the ring was visible; but the setting, which was\nturned toward the palm of his hand, consisted of a magnificent\nruby. Arsene Lupin blushed. The ring belonged to Georges Devanne.\nHe smiled bitterly, and said:",
        "“You are right. Nothing can be changed. Arsene Lupin is now and\nalways will be Arsene Lupin. To you, he cannot be even so much as\na memory. Pardon me....I should have known that any attention I\nmay now offer you is simply an insult. Forgive me.”",
        "He stepped aside, hat in hand. Nelly passed before him. He was\ninclined to detain her and beseech her forgiveness. But his\ncourage failed, and he contented himself by following her with his\neyes, as he had done when she descended the gangway to the pier at\nNew York. She mounted the steps leading to the door, and\ndisappeared within the house. He saw her no more.",
        "A cloud obscured the sun. Arsene Lupin stood watching the imprints\nof her tiny feet in the sand. Suddenly, he gave a start. Upon the\nbox which contained the bamboo, beside which Nelly had been\nstanding, he saw the rose, the white rose which he had desired but\ndared not ask for. Forgotten, no doubt--it, also! But how--\ndesignedly or through distraction? He seized it eagerly. Some of\nits petals fell to the ground. He picked them up, one by one, like\nprecious relics. 64-LUPIN-Mitchell.",
        "“Come!” he said to himself, “I have nothing more to do here. I\nmust think of my safety, before Sherlock Holmes arrives.”",
        "The park was deserted, but some gendarmes were stationed at the\npark-gate. He entered a grove of pine trees, leaped over the wall,\nand, as a short cut to the railroad station, followed a path across\nthe fields. After walking about ten minutes, he arrived at a spot\nwhere the road grew narrower and ran between two steep banks. In\nthis ravine, he met a man traveling in the opposite direction. It\nwas a man about fifty years of age, tall, smooth-shaven, and\nwearing clothes of a foreign cut. He carried a heavy cane, and a\nsmall satchel was strapped across his shoulder. When they met, the\nstranger spoke, with a slight English accent:",
        "“Excuse me, monsieur, is this the way to the castle?”",
        "“Yes, monsieur, straight ahead, and turn to the left when you come\nto the wall. They are expecting you.”",
        "“Ah!”",
        "“Yes, my friend Devanne told us last night that you were coming,\nand I am delighted to be the first to welcome you. Sherlock Holmes\nhas no more ardent admirer than....myself.”",
        "There was a touch of irony in his voice that he quickly regretted,\nfor Sherlock Holmes scrutinized him from head to foot with such a\nkeen, penetrating eye that Arsene Lupin experienced the sensation\nof being seized, imprisoned and registered by that look more\nthoroughly and precisely than he had ever been my a camera.",
        "“My negative is taken now,” he thought, “and it will be useless to\nuse a disguise with that man. He would look right through it.\nBut, I wonder, has he recognized me?”",
        "They bowed to each other as if about to part. But, at that moment,\nthey heard a sound of horses’ feet, accompanied by a clinking of\nsteel. It was the gendarmes. The two men were obliged to draw\nback against the embankment, amongst the brushes, to avoid the\nhorses. The gendarmes passed by, but, as they followed each other\nat a considerable distance, they were several minutes in doing so.\nAnd Lupin was thinking:",
        "“It all depends on that question: has he recognized me? If so, he\nwill probably take advantage of the opportunity. It is a trying\nsituation.”",
        "When the last horseman had passed, Sherlock Holmes stepped forth\nand brushed the dust from his clothes. Then, for a moment, he and\nArsene Lupin gazed at each other; and, if a person could have seen\nthem at that moment, it would have been an interesting sight, and\nmemorable as the first meeting of two remarkable men, so strange,\nso powerfully equipped, both of superior quality, and destined by\nfate, through their peculiar attributes, to hurl themselves one at\nthe other like two equal forces that nature opposes, one against\nthe other, in the realms of space.",
        "Then the Englishman said: “Thank you, monsieur.”",
        "They parted. Lupin went toward the railway station, and Sherlock\nHolmes continued on his way to the castle.",
        "The local officers had given up the investigation after several\nhours of fruitless efforts, and the people at the castle were\nawaiting the arrival of the English detective with a lively\ncuriosity. At first sight, they were a little disappointed on\naccount of his commonplace appearance, which differed so greatly\nfrom the pictures they had formed of him in their own minds. He\ndid not in any way resemble the romantic hero, the mysterious and\ndiabolical personage that the name of Sherlock Holmes had evoked in\ntheir imaginations. However, Mon. Devanne exclaimed with much\ngusto:",
        "“Ah! monsieur, you are here! I am delighted to see you. It is a\nlong-deferred pleasure. Really, I scarcely regret what has\nhappened, since it affords me the opportunity to meet you. But,\nhow did you come?”",
        "“By the train.”",
        "“But I sent my automobile to meet you at the station.”",
        "“An official reception, eh? with music and fireworks! Oh! no, not\nfor me. That is not the way I do business, grumbled the\nEnglishman.",
        "This speech disconcerted Devanne, who replied, with a forced smile:",
        "“Fortunately, the business has been greatly simplified since I\nwrote to you.”",
        "“In what way?”",
        "“The robbery took place last night.”",
        "“If you had not announced my intended visit, it is probably the\nrobbery would not have been committed last night.”",
        "“When, then?”",
        "“To-morrow, or some other day.”",
        "“And in that case?”",
        "“Lupin would have been trapped,” said the detective.",
        "“And my furniture?”",
        "“Would not have been carried away.”",
        "“Ah! but my goods are here. They were brought back at three\no’clock.”",
        "“By Lupin.”",
        "“By two army-wagons.”",
        "Sherlock Holmes put on his cap and adjusted his satchel. Devanne\nexclaimed, anxiously:",
        "“But, monsieur, what are you going to do?”",
        "“I am going home.”",
        "“Why?”",
        "“Your goods have been returned; Arsene Lupin is far away--there is\nnothing for me to do.”",
        "“Yes, there is. I need your assistance. What happened yesterday,\nmay happen again to-morrow, as we do not know how he entered, or\nhow he escaped, or why, a few hours later, he returned the goods.”",
        "“Ah! you don’t know--”",
        "The idea of a problem to be solved quickened the interest of\nSherlock Holmes.",
        "“Very well, let us make a search--at once--and alone, if possible.”",
        "Devanne understood, and conducted the Englishman to the salon. In\na dry, crisp voice, in sentences that seemed to have been prepared\nin advance, Holmes asked a number of questions about the events of\nthe preceding evening, and enquired also concerning the guests and\nthe members of the household. Then he examined the two volumes of\nthe “Chronique,” compared the plans of the subterranean passage,\nrequested a repetition of the sentences discovered by Father Gelis,\nand then asked:",
        "“Was yesterday the first time you have spoken hose two sentences to\nany one?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“You had never communicated then to Horace Velmont?”",
        "“No.”",
        "“Well, order the automobile. I must leave in an hour.”",
        "“In an hour?”",
        "“Yes; within that time, Arsene Lupin solved the problem that you\nplaced before him.”",
        "“I....placed before him--”",
        "“Yes, Arsene Lupin or Horace Velmont--same thing.”",
        "“I thought so. Ah! the scoundrel!”",
        "“Now, let us see,” said Holmes, “last night at ten o’clock, you\nfurnished Lupin with the information that he lacked, and that he\nhad been seeking for many weeks. During the night, he found time\nto solve the problem, collect his men, and rob the castle. I shall\nbe quite as expeditious.”",
        "He walked from end to end of the room, in deep thought, then sat\ndown, crossed his long legs and closed his eyes.",
        "Devanne waited, quite embarrassed. Thought he: “Is the man asleep?\nOr is he only meditating?” However, he left the room to give some\norders, and when he returned he found the detective on his knees\nscrutinizing the carpet at the foot of the stairs in the gallery.",
        "“What is it?” he enquired.",
        "“Look....there....spots from a candle.”",
        "“You are right--and quite fresh.”",
        "“And you will also find them at the top of the stairs, and around\nthe cabinet that Arsene Lupin broke into, and from which he took\nthe bibelots that he afterward placed in this armchair.”",
        "“What do you conclude from that?”",
        "“Nothing. These facts would doubtless explain the cause for the\nrestitution, but that is a side issue that I cannot wait to\ninvestigate. The main question is the secret passage. First, tell\nme, is there a chapel some two or three hundred metres from the\ncastle?”",
        "“Yes, a ruined chapel, containing the tomb of Duke Rollo.”",
        "“Tell your chauffer to wait for us near that chapel.”",
        "“My chauffer hasn’t returned. If he had, they would have informed\nme. Do you think the secret passage runs to the chapel? What\nreason have--”",
        "“I would ask you, monsieur,” interrupted the detective, “to furnish\nme with a ladder and a lantern.”",
        "“What! do you require a ladder and a lantern?”",
        "“Certainly, or I shouldn’t have asked for them.”",
        "Devanne, somewhat disconcerted by this crude logic, rang the bell.\nThe two articles were given with the sternness and precision of\nmilitary commands.",
        "“Place the ladder against the bookcase, to the left of the word\nThibermesnil.”",
        "Devanne placed the ladder as directed, and the Englishman\ncontinued:",
        "“More to the left....to the right....There!....Now, climb up....\nAll the letters are in relief, aren’t they?”",
        "“Yes.”",
        "“First, turn the letter I one way or the other.”",
        "“Which one? There are two of them.”",
        "“The first one.”",
        "Devanne took hold of the letter, and exclaimed:",
        "“Ah! yes, it turns toward the right. Who told you that?”",
        "Sherlock Holmes did not reply to the question, but continued his\ndirections:",
        "“Now, take the letter B. Move it back and forth as you would a\nbolt.”",
        "Devanne did so, and, to his great surprise, it produced a clicking\nsound.",
        "“Quite right,” said Holmes. “Now, we will go to the other end of\nthe word Thibermesnil, try the letter I, and see if it will open\nlike a wicket.”",
        "With a certain degree of solemnity, Devanne seized the letter. It\nopened, but Devanne fell from the ladder, for the entire section of\nthe bookcase, lying between the first and last letters of the\nwords, turned on a picot and disclosed the subterranean passage.",
        "Sherlock Holmes said, coolly:",
        "“You are not hurt?”",
        "“No, no,” said Devanne, as he rose to his feet, “not hurt, only\nbewildered. I can’t understand now....those letters turn....the\nsecret passage opens....”",
        "“Certainly. Doesn’t that agree exactly with the formula given by\nSully? Turn one eye on the bee that shakes, the other eye will\nlead to God.”",
        "“But Louis the sixteenth?” asked Devanne.",
        "“Louis the sixteenth was a clever locksmith. I have read a book he\nwrote about combination locks. It was a good idea on the part of\nthe owner of Thibermesnil to show His Majesty a clever bit of\nmechanism. As an aid to his memory, the king wrote: 3-4-11, that\nis to say, the third, fourth and eleventh letters of the word.”",
        "“Exactly. I understand that. It explains how Lupin got out of the\nroom, but it does not explain how he entered. And it is certain he\ncame from the outside.”",
        "Sherlock Holmes lighted his lantern, and stepped into the passage.",
        "“Look! All the mechanism is exposed here, like the works of a\nclock, and the reverse side of the letters can be reached. Lupin\nworked the combination from this side--that is all.”",
        "“What proof is there of that?”",
        "“Proof? Why, look at that puddle of oil. Lupin foresaw that the\nwheels would require oiling.”",
        "“Did he know about the other entrance?”",
        "“As well as I know it,” said Holmes. “Follow me.”",
        "“Into that dark passage?”",
        "“Are you afraid?”",
        "“No, but are you sure you can find the way out?”",
        "“With my eyes closed.”",
        "At first, they descended twelve steps, then twelve more, and,\nfarther on, two other flights of twelve steps each. Then they\nwalked through a long passageway, the brick walls of which showed\nthe marks of successive restorations, and, in spots, were dripping\nwith water. The earth, also, was very damp.",
        "“We are passing under the pond,” said Devanne, somewhat nervously.",
        "At last, they came to a stairway of twelve steps, followed by three\nothers of twelve steps each, which they mounted with difficulty,\nand then found themselves in a small cavity cut in the rock. They\ncould go no further.",
        "“The deuce!” muttered Holmes, “nothing but bare walls. This is\nprovoking.”",
        "“Let us go back,” said Devanne. “I have seen enough to satisfy\nme.”",
        "But the Englishman raised his eye and uttered a sigh of relief.\nThere, he saw the same mechanism and the same word as before. He\nhad merely to work the three letters. He did so, and a block of\ngranite swung out of place. On the other side, this granite block\nformed the tombstone of Duke Rollo, and the word “Thibermesnil” was\nengraved on it in relief. Now, they were in the little ruined\nchapel, and the detective said:",
        "“The other eye leads to God; that means, to the chapel.”",
        "“It is marvelous!” exclaimed Devanne, amazed at the clairvoyance\nand vivacity of the Englishman. “Can it be possible that those few\nwords were sufficient for you?”",
        "“Bah!” declared Holmes, “they weren’t even necessary. In the chart\nin the book of the National Library, the drawing terminates at the\nleft, as you know, in a circle, and at the right, as you do not\nknow, in a cross. Now, that cross must refer to the chapel in\nwhich we now stand.”",
        "Poor Devanne could not believe his ears. It was all so new, so\nnovel to him. He exclaimed:",
        "“It is incredible, miraculous, and yet of a childish simplicity!\nHow is it that no one has ever solved the mystery?”",
        "“Because no one has ever united the essential elements, that is to\nsay, the two books and the two sentences. No one, but Arsene Lupin\nand myself.”",
        "“But, Father Gelis and I knew all about those things, and,\nlikewise--”",
        "Holmes smiled, and said:",
        "“Monsieur Devanne, everybody cannot solve riddles.”",
        "“I have been trying for ten years to accomplish what you did in ten\nminutes.”",
        "“Bah! I am used to it.”",
        "They emerged from the chapel, and found an automobile.",
        "“Ah! there’s an auto waiting for us.”",
        "“Yes, it is mine,” said Devanne.",
        "“Yours? You said your chauffeur hadn’t returned.”",
        "They approached the machine, and Mon. Devanne questioned the\nchauffer:",
        "“Edouard, who gave you orders to come here?”",
        "“Why, it was Monsieur Velmont.”",
        "“Mon. Velmont? Did you meet him?”",
        "“Near the railway station, and he told me to come to the chapel.”",
        "“To come to the chapel! What for?”",
        "“To wait for you, monsieur, and your friend.”",
        "Devanne and Holmes exchanged looks, and Mon. Devanne said:",
        "“He knew the mystery would be a simple one for you. It is a\ndelicate compliment.”",
        "A smile of satisfaction lighted up the detective’s serious features\nfor a moment. The compliment pleased him. He shook his head, as\nhe said:",
        "“A clever man! I knew that when I saw him.”",
        "“Have you seen him?”",
        "“I met him a short time ago--on my way from the station.”",
        "“And you knew it was Horace Velmont--I mean, Arsene Lupin?”",
        "“That is right. I wonder how it came--”",
        "“No, but I supposed it was--from a certain ironical speech he made.”",
        "“And you allowed him to escape?”",
        "“Of course I did. And yet I had everything on my side, such as\ngive gendarmes who passed us.”",
        "“Sacrableu!” cried Devanne. “You should have taken advantage of\nthe opportunity.”",
        "“Really, monsieur,” said the Englishman, haughtily, “when I\nencounter an adversary like Arsene Lupin, I do not take advantage\nof chance opportunities, I create them.”",
        "But time pressed, and since Lupin had been so kind as to send the\nautomobile, they resolved to profit by it. They seated themselves\nin the comfortable limousine; Edouard took his place at the wheel,\nand away they went toward the railway station. Suddenly, Devanne’s\neyes fell upon a small package in one of the pockets of the\ncarriage.",
        "“Ah! what is that? A package! Whose is it? Why, it is for you.”",
        "“For me?”",
        "“Yes, it is addressed: Sherlock Holmes, from Arsene Lupin.”",
        "The Englishman took the package, opened it, and found that it\ncontained a watch.",
        "“Ah!” he exclaimed, with an angry gesture.",
        "“A watch,” said Devanne. “How did it come there?”",
        "The detective did not reply.",
        "“Oh! it is your watch! Arsene Lupin returns your watch! But, in\norder to return it, he must have taken it. Ah! I see! He took\nyour watch! That is a good one! Sherlock Holmes’ watch stolen by\nArsene Lupin! Mon Dieu! that is funny! Really....you must excuse\nme....I can’t help it.”",
        "He roared with laughter, unable to control himself. After which,\nhe said, in a tone of earnest conviction:",
        "“A clever man, indeed!”",
        "The Englishman never moved a muscle. On the way to Dieppe, he\nnever spoke a word, but fixed his gaze on the flying landscape.\nHis silence was terrible, unfathomable, more violent than the\nwildest rage. At the railway station, he spoke calmly, but in a\nvoice that impressed one with the vast energy and will power of\nthat famous man. He said:",
        "“Yes, he is a clever man, but some day I shall have the pleasure of\nplacing on his shoulder the hand I now offer to you, Monsieur\nDevanne. And I believe that Arsene Lupin and Sherlock Holmes will\nmeet again some day. Yes, the world is too small--we will meet--we\nmust meet--and then--”",
