        "We arrived in Verona day before yesterday. Most every one has heard of the\nTwo Gentlemen of Verona. This is the place they came from. They have never\nreturned. Verona is not noted for its gentlemen now. Perhaps that is the\nreason I was regarded as such a curiosity when I came here.",
        "Verona is a good deal older town than Chicago, but the two cities have\npoints of resemblance after all. When the southern simoon from the stock\nyards is wafted across the vinegar orchards of Chicago, and a load of\nMormon emigrants get out at the Rock Island depot and begin to move around\nand squirm and emit the fragrance of crushed Limburger cheese, it reminds\none of Verona.",
        "The sky is similar, too. At night, when it is raining hard, the sky of\nChicago and Verona is not dissimilar. Chicago is the largest place,\nhowever, and my sympathies are with her. Verona has about 68,000 people\nnow, aside from myself. This census includes foreigners and Indians not\ntaxed.",
        "Verona has an ancient skating rink, known in history as the amphitheatre,\nIt is 404-1/2 feet by 516 in size, and the wall is still 100 feet high in\nplaces. The people of Verona wanted me to lecture there, but I refrained.\nI was afraid that some late comers might elbow their way in and leave one\nend of the amphitheatre open and then there would be a draft. I will speak\nmore fully on the subject of amphitheatres in another letter. There isn’t\nroom in this one.",
        "Verona is noted for the Capitular library, as it is called. This is said\nto be the largest collection of rejected manuscripts in the world. I stood\nin with the librarian and he gave me an opportunity to examine this\nwonderful store of literary work. I found a Virgil that was certainly over\n1,600 years old. I also found a well preserved copy of “Beautiful Snow.” I\nread it. It was very touching indeed. Experts said it was 1,700 years old,\nwhich is no doubt correct. I am no judge of the age of MSS. Some can look\nat the teeth of a literary production and tell within two weeks how old it\nis, but I can’t. You can also fool me on the age of wine. My rule used to\nbe to observe how old I felt the next day and to fix that as the age of\nthe wine, but this rule I find is not infallible. One time I found myself\nfeeling the next day as though I might be 138 years old, but on\ninvestigation we found that the wine was extremely new, having been made\nat a drug store in Cheyenne that same day.",
        "Looking these venerable MSS. over, I noticed that the custom of writing\nwith a violet pencil on both sides of the large foolscap sheet, and then\nfolding it in sixteen directions and carrying it around in the pocket for\ntwo or three centuries, is not a late American invention, as I had been\nled to suppose. They did it in Italy fifteen centuries ago. I was\npermitted also to examine the celebrated institutes of Gaius. Gaius was a\npoor penman, and I am convinced from a close examination of his work that\nhe was in the habit of carrying his manuscript around in his pocket with\nhis smoking tobacco. The guide said that was impossible, for smoking\ntobacco was not introduced into Italy until a comparatively late day.\nThat’s all right, however. You can’t fool me much on the odor of smoking\ntobacco.",
        "The churches of Verona are numerous, and although they seem to me a little\ndifferent from our own in many ways, they resemble ours in others. One\nthing that pleased me about the churches of Verona was the total absence\nof the church fair and festival as conducted in America. Salvation seems\nto be handed out in Verona without ice cream and cake, and the odor of\nsancity and stewed oysters do not go inevitably hand in hand. I have\nalready been in the place more than two days and I have not yet been\ninvited to help lift the old church debt on the cathedral. Perhaps they\nthink I am not wealthy, however. In fact there is nothing about my dress\nor manner that would betray my wealth. I have been in Europe now six weeks\nand have kept my secret well. Even my most intimate traveling companions\ndo not know that I am the Laramie City postmaster in disguise.",
        "The cathedral is a most imposing and massive pile. I quote this from the\nguide book. This beautiful structure contains a baptismal font cut out of\none solid block of stone and made for immersion, with an inside diameter\nof ten feet. A man nine feet high could be baptized there without injury.\nThe Venetians have a great respect for water. They believe it ought not to\nbe used for anything else but to wash away sins, and even then they are\nvery economical about it.",
        "There is a nice picture here by Titian. It looks as though it had been\nleft in the smoke house 900 years and overlooked. Titian painted a great\ndeal. You find his works here ever and anon. He must have had all he could\ndo in Italy in an early day, when the country was new. I like his pictures\nfirst rate, but I haven’t found one yet that I could secure at anything\nlike a bed rock price.",
