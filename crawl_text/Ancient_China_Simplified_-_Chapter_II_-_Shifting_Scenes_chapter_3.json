        "Having now seen how the Chinese people, taking advantage of the\nmaterial and moral growth naturally following upon a settled\nindustrial existence, and above all upon the exclusive possession\nof a written character, gradually imposed themselves as rulers\nupon the ignorant tribes around them, let us see to what families\nthese Chinese emigrant adventurers or colonial satraps belonged.\nTo begin with the semi-Tartar power in the River Wei Valley–\ndestined six hundred years later to conquer the whole of China as\nwe know it to-day–the ruling caste claimed descent from the most\nancient (and of course partly mythological) Emperors of China; but\nfor over a thousand years previous to 842 B.C. this remote branch\nof the Chinese race had become scattered and almost lost amongst\nthe Tartars. However, a generation or two before our opening\nperiod, one of these princes had served the then ruling imperial\ndynasty as a sort of guardian to the western frontier, as a rearer\nof horses for the metropolitan stud, and perhaps even as a guide\non the occasion of imperial expeditions into Tartarland. The\nsuccessor of the Emperor who was driven from his capital in 842\nB.C. about twenty years later employed this western satrap to\nchastise the Tartar nomads whose revolt had in part led to the\nimperial flight. After suffering some disasters, the conductors of\nthis series of expeditions were at last successful, and in 815\nB.C. the title of “Warden of the Western Marches” was officially\nconferred on the ruler for the time being of this western state,\nwho in 777 B.C. had the further honour of seeing one of his\ndaughters married to the Emperor himself. This political move on\nthe part of the Emperor was unwise, for it led indirectly to the\nTartars, who were frequently engaged in war with the Warden,\ninterfering in the quarrels about the imperial succession, in\nwhich question the Tartars naturally thought they had a right to\ninterfere in the interests of their own people. The upshot of it\nwas that in 771 B.C. the Emperor was killed by the Tartars in\nbattle, and it was only by securing the military assistance of the\nsemi-Tartar Warden of the Marches that the imperial dynasty was\nsaved. As it was, the Emperor’s capital was permanently moved east\nfrom the immediate neighbourhood of what we call Si-ngan Fu in\nShen Si province to the immediate neighbourhood of Ho-nan Fu in\nthe modern Ho Nan province; and as a reward for his services the\nWarden was granted nearly the whole of the original imperial\npatrimony west of the Yellow River bend and on both sides of the\nWei Valley. This was also in the year 771 B.C., and this is really\none of the great pivot-points in Chinese history, of equal weight\nwith the almost contemporaneous founding of Rome, and the gradual\nsubstitution of a Roman centre for a Greek centre in the\ndevelopment and civilization of the Far West. The new capital was\nnot, however, a new city. Shortly after the imperial dynasty\ngained the possession of China in 1122 B.C., it had been surveyed,\nand some of the regalia had been taken thither; this, with a view\nof making it one of the capitals at least, if not the sole\ncapital.",
        "As Chinese names sound uncouth to our Western ears, and will,\ntherefore, in these introductory Chapters only be used sparingly\nand gradually, it becomes correspondingly difficult to explain\nhistorical phenomena adequately whilst endeavouring to avoid as\nfar as possible the use of such unintelligible names: it will be\nwell, then, to sum up the situation, and even repeat a little, so\nthat the reader may assimilate the main points without fatigue or\nrepulsion. The reigning dynasty of Chou had secured the adhesion\nof the thousand or more of Chinese vassal princes in 1122 B.C.,\nand had in other words “conquered” China by invitation, much in\nthe same way, and for very much the same general reasons, that\nWilliam III. had’ accepted the conquest of the British Isles; that\nis to say, because the people were dissatisfied with their\nlegitimate ruler and his house. But, before this conquest, the\nvassal princes of Chou had occupied practically the same\nterritory, and had stood in the same relation to the imperial\ndynasty subsequently ousted by them in 1122, that the Wardens of\nthe Marches occupied and stood in when the imperial house of Chou\nin turn fled east in 771 B.C. The Shang dynasty thus ousted by the\nChou princes in 1122, had for like misgovernment driven out the\nHia dynasty in 1766 B.C. Thus, at the time when the Wardens of the\nMarches (whose real territorial title was Princes of Ts’in)\npractically put the imperial power into commission in 771 B.C.,\nthe two old-fashioned dynasties of Shang and Chou had already\nruled patriarchally for almost exactly one thousand years, and\nnothing of either a very startling, or a very definite, character\nhad taken place at all within the comparatively narrow area\ndescribed in our first Chapter.",
        "From this date of 771 B.C., and for five hundred years more down\nto 250 B.C., when the Chou dynasty was extinguished, the rule of\nthe feudal Emperors of China was almost purely nominal, and except\nin so far as this or that powerful vassal made use of the moral,\nand even occasionally of the military power of the metropolitan\ndistrict when it suited his purpose, the imperial ruler was\nchiefly exercised in matters of form and ritual; for under all\nthree patriarchal dynasties it was on form and ritual that the\nidea of government had always been based. Of course the other\npowerful satraps–especially the more distant ones, those not\nbearing the imperial clan-name, and those more or less tinged with\nbarbarian usages–learning by degrees what a helpless and\npowerless personage the Emperor had now become, lost no time in\nturning the novel situation to their own advantage: it is\nconsequently now that begins the “tyrant period,” or the period of\nthe “Five Dictators,” as the Chinese historians loosely term it:\nthat is to say, the period during which each satrap who had the\npower to do so took the lead of the satrap body in general, and\ngave out that he was restoring the imperial prestige, representing\nthe Emperor’s majesty, carrying out the behests of reason,\ncompelling the other vassals to do their duty, keeping up the\nlegitimist sacrifices, and so on. In other words, the population\nof China had grown so enormously, both by peaceful in-breeding and\nby imperceptible absorption of kindred races, that more elbow-room\nwas needed; more freedom from the shackles of ritual, rank, and\nfeudal caste; more independence, and more liberty to take\nadvantage of local or changed traditions. Besides all this, the\nart of writing, though still clumsy, expensive, and confined in\nits higher and literary aspects to the governing classes, had\nrecently become simplified and improved; the salt trade, iron\ntrade, fish industry, silk industry, grain trade, and art of usury\nhad spread from one state to the other, and had developed: though\nthe land roads were bad or non-existent, there were great numbers\nof itinerant dealers in cattle and army provisions. In a word,\nmaterial civilization had made great strides during the thousand\nyears of patriarchal rule immediately preceding the critical\nperiod comprised between the year 842 B.C. and the year 771 B.C.\nThe voices of the advocates and the preachers of ancient\npatriarchal virtues were as of men crying in a wilderness of\nsubstantial prosperity and manly ambition. Thus political and\nnatural forces combined with each other to prepare the way for a\nradical change, and this period of incipient revolution is\nprecisely the period (722-480) treated of in Confucius’ history,\nthe first history of China–meagre though it be–which deals with\ndefinite human facts, instead of “beating the air” (as the Chinese\nsay) with sermons and ritualistic exhortations.",
