        "The New War Chief",
        "Caleb had been very busy all the day before doing no one knew what,\nand Saryann was busy, too. She had been very busy for long, but now\nshe was bustling. Then, it seems, Caleb had gone to Mrs. Raften, and\nshe was very busy, and Guy made a flying visit to Mrs. Burns, and\nshe had become busy. Thus they turned the whole neighbourhood into a\n“bee.”",
        "For this was Sanger, where small gatherings held the same place as the\nclub, theatre and newspaper do in the lives of city folk. No matter\nwhat the occasion, a christening, wedding or funeral, a logging, a\nthreshing, a home-coming or a parting, the finishing of a new house\nor the buying of a new harness or fanning-mill, any one of these was\nample grounds for one of their “talking bees\"; so it was easy to set\nthe wheels a-running.",
        "At three o’clock three processions might have been seen wending\nthrough the woods. One was from Burns’s, including the whole family;\none from Raften’s, comprising the family and the hired men; one from\nCaleb’s, made up of Saryann and many of the Boyles. All brought\nbaskets.",
        "They were seated in a circle on the pleasant grassy bank of the\npond. Caleb and Sam took charge of the ceremonies. First, there were\nfoot-races, in which Yan won in spite of his wounded arm, the city boy\nmaking a good second; then target-shooting and “Deer-hunting,” that\nYan could not take part in. It was not in the programme, but Raften\ninsisted on seeing Yan measure the height of a knot in a tree without\ngoing to it, and grinned with delight when he found it was accurate.",
        "“Luk at that for eddication, Sam!” he roared. “When will ye be able to\ndo the like? Arrah, but ye’re good stuff, Yan, an’ I’ve got something\nhere’ll plase ye.”",
        "Raften now pulled out his purse and as magistrate paid over with\nevident joy the $5 bounty due for killing the Lynx. Then he added:\n“An’ if it turns out as ye all claim” [and it did] “that this yer\nbeast is the Sheep-killer instid av old Turk, I’ll add that other\ntin.”",
        "Thus Yan came into the largest sum be had ever owned in his life.",
        "Then the Indians went into their teepees. Caleb set up a stake in the\nground and on that a new shield of wood covered with rawhide; over the\nrawhide was lightly fastened a piece of sacking.",
        "The guests were in a circle around this; at one side were some\nskins–Yan’s Lynx and Coon–and the two stuffed Owls.",
        "Then the drum was heard, “Túm-tum–túm-tum–túm-tum–túm-tum––\"\nThere was a volley of war-whoops, and out of the teepees dashed the\nSanger Indians in full war paint.",
        "  “Ki ki–ki yi–ki yi yi yi\n  Ki yi–ki yi–ki yi yi yi!”",
        "They danced in exact time to the two-measure of the drum that was\npounded by Blackhawk. Three times round the central post with the\nshield they danced, then the drum stopped, and they joined in a grand\nfinal war-whoop and squatted in a circle within that of the guests.",
        "The Great Woodpecker now arose–his mother had to be told who it\nwas–and made a characteristic speech:",
        "“Big Chiefs, Little Chiefs, and Squapooses of the Sanger Indians: A\nnumber of things has happened to rob this yer nation of its noble Head\nChief; they kin never again expect to have his equal, but this yer\nassembly is for to pick out a new one. We had a kind of whack at it\nthe other day, but couldn’t agree. Since then we had a hard trip, and\nthings has cleared up some, same as puttin’ Kittens in a pond will\ntell which one is the swimmer, an’ we’re here to-day to settle it.”",
        "Loud cries of “How–how–how–how–” while Blackhawk pounded the drum\nvigorously.",
        "“O’ course different ones has different gifts. Now who in all this\nTribe is the best runner? That’s Little Beaver.”",
        "(\"How–how–how–how–how–” and drum.)",
        "“That’s my drum, Ma!” said Guy aside, forgetting to applaud.",
        "“Who is the best trailer and climber? Little Beaver, again, I reckon.”",
        "(\"How–how–how–how–” and drum.)",
        "(\"He can’t see worth a cent!” whispered Guy to his mother.)",
        "“Who was it won the trial of grit at Garney’s grave? Why, it was\nLittle Beaver.”",
        "(\"An’ got pretty badly scared doin’ it!” was Guy’s aside.)",
        "“But who was it shot the Cat-Owl plumb in the heart, an’ fit the Lynx\nhand to hand, not to speak of the Coon? Little Beaver every time.”",
        "(\"He never killed a Woodchuck in his life, Ma!”)",
        "“Then, again, which of us can lay all the others on his back? Little\nBeaver, I s’pose.”",
        "(\"Well, I can lick Char-less, any time,” was Guy’s aside.)",
        "“Which of us has most grand coups and scalps?”",
        "“Ye’re forgittin’ his eddication,” put in Raften to be scornfully\nignored; even Little Beaver resented this as un-Indian.",
        "“Which has most scalps?” Sam repeated with sternness. “Here’s a scalp\nwon in battle with the inimy,” Woodpecker held it up, and the Medicine\nMan fastened it on the edge of the shield that hung from the post.",
        "“Here is one tuk from the Head Chief of the hostiles,” and Caleb\nfastened that to the shield. “Here is another tuk from the Second\nChief of the hostiles,” and Caleb placed it. “Here is one tuk from the\nGreat Head War Chief of the Sangers, and here is one from the Head\nChief of the Boilers, and another tuk in battle. Six scalps from six\nfamous warriors. This yere is the record for the whole Tribe, an’\nLittle Beaver done it; besides which, he draws pictures, writes\npoethry and cooks purty good, an’ I say Little Beaver is the one for\nChief! What says the rest?” and with one voice they shouted, “Hoorah\nfor Little Beaver!”",
        "“How–how–how–how–how–thump, thump, thump, thump.”",
        "“Any feller anything to say agin it?”",
        "“I eh–” Guy began.",
        "–\"has got to lick the Chief,” Sam continued, and Guy did not complete\nhis objection, though he whispered to his mother, “If it was Char-less\nI bet I’d show him.”",
        "[Illustration: The shield]",
        "Caleb now pulled the cover off the shield that he fastened the scalps\nto, and it showed the white Buffalo of the Sangers with a Little\nBeaver above it. Then he opened a bundle lying near and produced a\ngorgeous war-shirt of buff leather, a pair of leggins and moccasins,\nall fringed, beaded and painted, made by Saryann under Caleb’s\nguidance. They were quickly put on the new Chief; his war bonnet,\nsplendid with the plumes of his recent exploits, was all ready; and\nproud and happy in his new-found honours, not least of which were his\nwounds, he stepped forward.",
        "[Illustration: Little Beaver, the New War Chief]",
        "Caleb viewed him with paternal pride and said: “I knowed ye was the\nstuff the night ye went to Garney’s grave, an’ I knowed it again when\nye crossed the Big Swamp. Yan, ye could travel anywhere that man could\ngo,” and in that sentence the boy’s happiness was complete. He surely\nwas a Woodcrafter now. He stammered in a vain attempt to say something\nappropriate, till Sam relieved him by: “Three cheers for the Head War\nChief!” and when the racket was over the women opened their baskets\nand spread the picnic feast. Raften, who had been much gratified by\nhis son’s flow of speech, recorded a new vow to make him study law,\nbut took advantage of the first gap in the chatter to say:",
        "“Bhise, ye’r two weeks’ holiday with wan week extension was up at noon\nto-day. In wan hour an’ a half the Pigs is fed.”",
