        "This Cheyenne war chief was a contemporary of Dull Knife.  He was\nnot so strong a character as the other, and was inclined to be\npompous and boastful; but with all this he was a true type of\nnative American in spirit and bravery.",
        "While Dull Knife was noted in warfare among Indians, Roman\nNose made his record against the whites, in defense of territory\nembracing the Republican and Arickaree rivers.  He was killed on\nthe latter river in 1868, in the celebrated battle with General\nForsythe.",
        "Save Chief Gall and Washakie in the prime of their manhood,\nthis chief had no peer in bodily perfection and masterful\npersonality.  No Greek or Roman gymnast was ever a finer model of\nphysical beauty and power.  He thrilled his men to frenzied action\nwhen he came upon the field.  It was said of him that he sacrificed\nmore youths by his personal influence in battle than any other\nleader, being very reckless himself in grand-stand charges.  He was\nkilled needlessly in this manner.",
        "Roman Nose always rode an uncommonly fine, spirited horse, and\nwith his war bonnet and other paraphernalia gave a wonderful\nexhibition.  The Indians used to say that the soldiers must gaze at\nhim rather than aim at him, as they so seldom hit him even when\nrunning the gantlet before a firing line.",
        "He did a remarkable thing once when on a one-arrow-to-kill\nbuffalo hunt with his brother-in-law.  His companion had selected\nhis animal and drew so powerfully on his sinew bowstring that it\nbroke.  Roman Nose had killed his own cow and was whipping up close\nto the other when the misfortune occurred.  Both horses were going\nat full speed and the arrow jerked up in the air.  Roman Nose\ncaught it and shot the cow for him.",
        "Another curious story told of him is to the effect that he had\nan intimate Sioux friend who was courting a Cheyenne girl, but\nwithout success.  As the wooing of both Sioux and Cheyennes was\npretty much all effected in the night time, Roman Nose told his\nfriend to let him do the courting for him.  He arranged with the\nyoung woman to elope the next night and to spend the honeymoon\namong his Sioux friends.  He then told his friend what to do. The\nSioux followed instructions and carried off the Cheyenne maid, and\nnot until morning did she discover her mistake.  It is said she\nnever admitted it, and that the two lived happily together to a\ngood old age, so perhaps there was no mistake after all.",
        "Perhaps no other chief attacked more emigrants going west on\nthe Oregon Trail between 1860 and 1868.  He once made an attack on\na large party of Mormons, and in this instance the Mormons had time\nto form a corral with their wagons and shelter their women,\nchildren, and horses.  The men stood outside and met the Indians\nwith well-aimed volleys, but they circled the wagons with whirlwind\nspeed, and whenever a white man fell, it was the signal for Roman\nNose to charge and count the “coup.”  The hat of one of the dead\nmen was off, and although he had heavy hair and beard, the top of\nhis head was bald from the forehead up.  As custom required such a\ndeed to be announced on the spot, the chief yelled at the top of\nhis voice:",
        "“Your Roman Nose has counted the first coup on the\nlongest-faced white man who was ever killed!”",
        "When the Northern Cheyennes under this daring leader attacked\na body of scouting troops under the brilliant officer General\nForsythe, Roman Nose thought that he had a comparatively easy task. \nThe first onset failed, and the command entrenched itself on a\nlittle island.  The wily chief thought he could stampede them and\nurged on his braves with the declaration that the first to reach\nthe island should be entitled to wear a trailing war bonnet. \nNevertheless he was disappointed, and his men received such a warm\nreception that none succeeded in reaching it. In order to inspire\nthem to desperate deeds he had led them in person, and with him\nthat meant victory or death.  According to the army accounts, it\nwas a thrilling moment, and might well have proved disastrous to\nthe Forsythe command, whose leader was wounded and helpless.  The\ndanger was acute until Roman Nose fell, and even then his\nlieutenants were bent upon crossing at any cost, but some of the\nolder chiefs prevailed upon them to withdraw.",
        "Thus the brilliant war chief of the Cheyennes came to his\ndeath.  If he had lived until 1876, Sitting Bull would have had\nanother bold ally.",
