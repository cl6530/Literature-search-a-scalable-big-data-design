        "As soon as Dete had disappeared the old man went back to his\nbench, and there he remained seated, staring on the ground\nwithout uttering a sound, while thick curls of smoke floated\nupward from his pipe. Heidi, meanwhile, was enjoying herself in\nher new surroundings; she looked about till she found a shed,\nbuilt against the hut, where the goats were kept; she peeped in,\nand saw it was empty. She continued her search and presently\ncame to the fir trees behind the hut. A strong breeze was blowing\nthrough them, and there was a rushing and roaring in their\ntopmost branches, Heidi stood still and listened. The sound\ngrowing fainter, she went on again, to the farther corner of the\nhut, and so round to where her grandfather was sitting. Seeing\nthat he was in exactly the same position as when she left him,\nshe went and placed herself in front of the old man, and putting\nher hands behind her back, stood and gazed at him. Her\ngrandfather looked up, and as she continued standing there\nwithout moving, “What is it you want?” he asked.",
        "“I want to see what you have inside the house,” said Heidi.",
        "“Come then!” and the grandfather rose and went before her\ntowards the hut.",
        "“Bring your bundle of clothes in with you,” he bid her as she\nwas following.",
        "“I shan’t want them any more,” was her prompt answer.",
        "The old man turned and looked searchingly at the child, whose\ndark eyes were sparkling in delighted anticipation of what she\nwas going to see inside. “She is certainly not wanting in\nintelligence,” he murmured to himself. “And why shall you not\nwant them any more?” he asked aloud.",
        "“Because I want to go about like the goats with their thin light\nlegs.”",
        "“Well, you can do so if you like,” said her grandfather, “but\nbring the things in, we must put them in the cupboard.”",
        "Heidi did as she was told. The old man now opened the door and\nHeidi stepped inside after him; she found herself in a good-\nsized room, which covered the whole ground floor of the hut. A\ntable and a chair were the only furniture; in one corner stood\nthe grandfather’s bed, in another was the hearth with a large\nkettle hanging above it; and on the further side was a large door\nin the wall–this was the cupboard. The grandfather opened it;\ninside were his clothes, some hanging up, others, a couple of\nshirts, and some socks and handkerchiefs, lying on a shelf; on a\nsecond shelf were some plates and cups and glasses, and on a\nhigher one still, a round loaf, smoked meat, and cheese, for\neverything that Alm-Uncle needed for his food and clothing was\nkept in this cupboard. Heidi, as soon as it was opened, ran\nquickly forward and thrust in her bundle of clothes, as far back\nbehind her grandfather’s things as possible, so that they might\nnot easily be found again. She then looked carefully round the\nroom, and asked, “Where am I to sleep, grandfather?”",
        "“Wherever you like,” he answered.",
        "Heidi was delighted, and began at once to examine all the nooks\nand corners to find out where it would be pleasantest to sleep.\nIn the corner near her grandfather’s bed she saw a short ladder\nagainst the wall; up she climbed and found herself in the\nhayloft. There lay a large heap of fresh sweet-smelling hay,\nwhile through a round window in the wall she could see right\ndown the valley.",
        "“I shall sleep up here, grandfather,” she called down to him,\n“It’s lovely, up here. Come up and see how lovely it is!”",
        "“Oh, I know all about it,” he called up in answer.",
        "“I am getting the bed ready now,” she called down again, as she\nwent busily to and fro at her work, “but I shall want you to\nbring me up a sheet; you can’t have a bed without a sheet, you\nwant it to lie upon.”",
        "“All right,” said the grandfather, and presently he went to the\ncupboard, and after rummaging about inside for a few minutes he\ndrew out a long, coarse piece of stuff, which was all he had to\ndo duty for a sheet. He carried it up to the loft, where he\nfound Heidi had already made quite a nice bed. She had put an\nextra heap of hay at one end for a pillow, and had so arranged it\nthat, when in bed, she would be able to see comfortably out\nthrough the round window.",
        "“That is capital,” said her grandfather; “now we must put on the\nsheet, but wait a moment first,” and he went and fetched another\nlarge bundle of hay to make the bed thicker, so that the child\nshould not feel the hard floor under her–\"there, now bring it\nhere.” Heidi had got hold of the sheet, but it was almost too\nheavy for her to carry; this was a good thing, however, as the\nclose thick stuff would prevent the sharp stalks of the hay\nrunning through and pricking her. The two together now spread\nthe sheet over the bed, and where it was too long or too broad,\nHeidi quickly tucked it in under the hay. It looked now as tidy\nand comfortable a bed as you could wish for, and Heidi stood\ngazing thoughtfully at her handiwork.",
        "“We have forgotten something now, grandfather,” she said after a\nshort silence.",
        "“What’s that?” he asked.",
        "“A coverlid; when you get into bed, you have to creep in between\nthe sheets and the coverlid.”",
        "“Oh, that’s the way, is it? But suppose I have not got a\ncoverlid?” said the old man.",
        "“Well, never mind, grandfather,” said Heidi in a consoling tone\nof voice, “I can take some more hay to put over me,” and she was\nturning quickly to fetch another armful from the heap, when her\ngrandfather stopped her. “Wait a moment,” he said, and he\nclimbed down the ladder again and went towards his bed. He\nreturned to the loft with a large, thick sack, made of flax,\nwhich he threw down, exclaiming, “There, that is better than hay,\nis it not?”",
        "Heidi began tugging away at the sack with all her little might,\nin her efforts to get it smooth and straight, but her small\nhands were not fitted for so heavy a job. Her grandfather came to\nher assistance, and when they had got it tidily spread over the\nbed, it all looked so nice and warm and comfortable that Heidi\nstood gazing at it in delight. “That is a splendid coverlid,” she\nsaid, “and the bed looks lovely altogether! I wish it was night,\nso that I might get inside it at once.”",
        "“I think we might have something to eat first,” said the\ngrandfather, “what do you think?”",
        "Heidi in the excitement of bed-making had forgotten everything\nelse; but now when she began to think about food she felt\nterribly hungry, for she had had nothing to eat since the piece\nof bread and little cup of thin coffee that had been her\nbreakfast early that morning before starting on her long, hot\njourney. So she answered without hesitation, “Yes, I think so\ntoo.”",
        "“Let us go down then, as we both think alike,” said the old man,\nand he followed the child down the ladder. Then he went up to\nthe hearth, pushed the big kettle aside, and drew forward the\nlittle one that was hanging on the chain, and seating himself on\nthe round-topped, three-legged stool before the fire, blew it up\ninto a clear bright flame. The kettle soon began to boil, and\nmeanwhile the old man held a large piece of cheese on a long\niron fork over the fire, turning it round and round till it was\ntoasted a nice golden yellow color on each side. Heidi watched\nall that was going on with eager curiosity. Suddenly some new\nidea seemed to come into her head, for she turned and ran to the\ncupboard, and then began going busily backwards and forwards.\nPresently the grandfather got up and came to the table with a\njug and the cheese, and there he saw it already tidily laid with\nthe round loaf and two plates and two knives each in its right\nplace; for Heidi had taken exact note that morning of all that\nthere was in the cupboard, and she knew which things would be\nwanted for their meal.",
        "“Ah, that’s right,” said the grandfather, “I am glad to see that\nyou have some ideas of your own,” and as he spoke he laid the\ntoasted cheese on a layer of bread, “but there is still\nsomething missing.”",
        "Heidi looked at the jug that was steaming away invitingly, and\nran quickly back to the cupboard. At first she could only see a\nsmall bowl left on the shelf, but she was not long in\nperplexity, for a moment later she caught sight of two glasses\nfurther back, and without an instant’s loss of time she returned\nwith these and the bowl and put them down on the table.",
        "“Good, I see you know how to set about things; but what will you\ndo for a seat?” The grandfather himself was sitting on the only\nchair in the room. Heidi flew to the hearth, and dragging the\nthree-legged stool up to the table, sat herself down upon it.",
        "“Well, you have managed to find a seat for yourself, I see, only\nrather a low one I am afraid,” said the grandfather, “but you\nwould not be tall enough to reach the table even if you sat in\nmy chair; the first thing now, however, is to have something to\neat, so come along.”",
        "With that he stood up, filled the bowl with milk, and placing it\non the chair, pushed it in front of Heidi on her little three-\nlegged stool, so that she now had a table to herself. Then he\nbrought her a large slice of bread and a piece of the golden\ncheese, and told her to eat. After which he went and sat down on\nthe corner of the table and began his own meal. Heidi lifted the\nbowl with both hands and drank without pause till it was empty,\nfor the thirst of all her long hot journey had returned upon\nher. Then she drew a deep breath–in the eagerness of her thirst\nshe had not stopped to breathe–and put down the bowl.",
        "“Was the milk nice?” asked her grandfather.",
        "“I never drank any so good before,” answered Heidi.",
        "“Then you must have some more,” and the old man filled her bowl\nagain to the brim and set it before the child, who was now\nhungrily beginning her bread having first spread it with the\ncheese, which after being toasted was soft as butter; the two\ntogether tasted deliciously, and the child looked the picture of\ncontent as she sat eating, and at intervals taking further\ndraughts of milk. The meal being over, the grandfather went\noutside to put the goat-shed in order, and Heidi watched with\ninterest while he first swept it out, and then put fresh straw\nfor the goats to sleep upon. Then he went to the little well-\nshed, and there he cut some long round sticks, and a small round\nboard; in this he bored some holes and stuck the sticks into\nthem, and there, as if made by magic, was a three-legged stool\njust like her grandfather’s, only higher. Heidi stood and looked\nat it, speechless with astonishment.",
        "“What do you think that is?” asked her grandfather.",
        "“It’s my stool, I know, because it is such a high one; and it\nwas made all of a minute,” said the child, still lost in wonder\nand admiration.",
        "“She understands what she sees, her eyes are in the right\nplace,” remarked the grandfather to himself, as he continued his\nway round the hut, knocking in a nail here and there, or making\nfast some part of the door, and so with hammer and nails and\npieces of wood going from spot to spot, mending or clearing away\nwherever work of the kind was needed. Heidi followed him step by\nstep, her eyes attentively taking in all that he did, and\neverything that she saw was a fresh source of pleasure to her.",
        "And so the time passed happily on till evening. Then the wind\nbegan to roar louder than ever through the old fir trees; Heidi\nlistened with delight to the sound, and it filled her heart so\nfull of gladness that she skipped and danced round the old\ntrees, as if some unheard of joy had come to her. The grandfather\nstood and watched her from the shed.",
        "Suddenly a shrill whistle was heard. Heidi paused in her\ndancing, and the grandfather came out. Down from the heights\nabove the goats came springing one after another, with Peter in\ntheir midst. Heidi sprang forward with a cry of joy and rushed\namong the flock, greeting first one and then another of her old\nfriends of the morning. As they neared the hut the goats stood\nstill, and then two of their number, two beautiful slender\nanimals, one white and one brown, ran forward to where the\ngrandfather was standing and began licking his hands, for he was\nholding a little salt which he always had ready for his goats on\ntheir return home. Peter disappeared with the remainder of his\nflock. Heidi tenderly stroked the two goats in turn, running\nfirst to one side of them and then the other, and jumping about\nin her glee at the pretty little animals. “Are they ours,\ngrandfather? Are they both ours? Are you going to put them in the\nshed? Will they always stay with us?”",
        "Heidi’s questions came tumbling out one after the other, so that\nher grandfather had only time to answer each of them with “Yes,\nyes.” When the goats had finished licking up the salt her\ngrandfather told her to go and fetch her bowl and the bread.",
        "Heidi obeyed and was soon back again. The grandfather milked the\nwhite goat and filled her basin, and then breaking off a piece\nof bread, “Now eat your supper,” he said, “and then go up to bed.\nCousin Dete left another little bundle for you with a nightgown\nand other small things in it, which you will find at the bottom\nof the cupboard if you want them. I must go and shut up the\ngoats, so be off and sleep well.”",
        "“Good-night, grandfather! good-night. What are their names,\ngrandfather, what are their names?” she called out as she ran\nafter his retreating figure and the goats.",
        "“The white one is named Little Swan, and the brown one Little\nBear,” he answered.",
        "“Good-night, Little Swan, good-night, Little Bear!” she called\nagain at the top of her voice, for they were already inside the\nshed. Then she sat down on the seat and began to eat and drink,\nbut the wind was so strong that it almost blew her away; so she\nmade haste and finished her supper and then went indoors and\nclimbed up to her bed, where she was soon lying as sweetly and\nsoundly asleep as any young princess on her couch of silk.",
        "Not long after, and while it was still twilight, the grandfather\nalso went to bed, for he was up every morning at sunrise, and\nthe sun came climbing up over the mountains at a very early hour\nduring these summer months. The wind grew so tempestuous during\nthe night, and blew in such gusts against the walls, that the\nhut trembled and the old beams groaned and creaked. It came\nhowling and wailing down the chimney like voices of those in\npain, and it raged with such fury among the old fir trees that\nhere and there a branch was snapped and fell. In the middle of\nthe night the old man got up. “The child will be frightened,” he\nmurmured half aloud. He mounted the ladder and went and stood by\nthe child’s bed.",
        "Outside the moon was struggling with the dark, fast-driving\nclouds, which at one moment left it clear and shining, and the\nnext swept over it, and all again was dark. Just now the\nmoonlight was falling through the round window straight on to\nHeidi’s bed. She lay under the heavy coverlid, her cheeks rosy\nwith sleep, her head peacefully resting on her little round arm,\nand with a happy expression on her baby face as if dreaming of\nsomething pleasant. The old man stood looking down on the\nsleeping child until the moon again disappeared behind the\nclouds and he could see no more, then he went back to bed.",
