        "The historical books to be found in the Bible, the Apocrypha, and the\nHellenistic literature prove that the Hebrew genius was not unfitted for\nthe presentation of the facts of Jewish life. These older works, as well\nas the writings of Josephus, also show a faculty for placing local\nrecords in relation to the wider facts of general history. After the\ndispersion of the Jews, however, the local was the only history in which\nthe Jews could bear a part. The Jews read history as a mere commentary\non their own fate, and hence they were unable to take the wide outlook\ninto the world required for the compilation of objective histories.\nThus, in their aim to find religious consolation for their sufferings in\nthe Middle Ages, the Jewish historians sought rather to trace the hand\nof Providence than to analyze the human causes of the changes in the\naffairs of mankind.",
        "But in another sense the Jews were essentially gifted with the\nhistorical spirit. The great men of Israel were not local heroes. Just\nas Plutarch’s Lives were part of the history of the world’s politics, so\nJewish biographies of learned men were part of the history of the\nworld’s civilization. With the “Order of the Tannaim and Amoraim\"\n(written about the year 1100) begins a series of such biographical\nworks, in which more appreciation of sober fact is displayed than might\nhave been expected from the period. In the same way the famous Letter of\nSherira Gaon on the compilation of the Rabbinical literature (980)\nmarked great progress in the critical examination of historical\nproblems. Later works did not maintain the same level.",
        "In the Middle Ages, Jewish histories mostly took the form of uncritical\nChronicles, which included legends and traditions as well as assured\nfacts. Their interest and importance lie in the personal and communal\ndetails with which they abound. Sometimes they are confessedly local.\nThis is the case with the “Chronicle of Achimaaz,” written by him in\n1055 in rhymed prose. In an entertaining style, he tells of the early\nsettlements of the Jews in Southern Italy, and throws much light on the\nintercommunication between the scattered Jewish congregations of his\ntime. A larger canvas was filled by Abraham Ibn Daud, the physician and\nphilosopher who was born in Toledo in 1110, and met a martyr’s end at\nthe age of seventy. His “Book of Tradition” (Sefer ha-Kabbalah),\nwritten in 1161, was designed to present, in opposition to the Karaites,\nthe chain of Jewish tradition as a series of unbroken links from the\nage of Moses to Ibn Baud’s own times. Starting with the Creation, his\nhistory ends with the anti-Karaitic crusade of Judah Ibn Ezra in Granada\n(1150). Abraham Ibn Daud shows in this work considerable critical power,\nbut in his two other histories, one dealing with the history of Rome\nfrom its foundation to the time of King Reccared in Spain, the other a\nnarrative of the history of the Jews during the Second Temple, the\nauthor relied entirely on “Josippon.” This was a medieval concoction\nwhich long passed as the original Josephus. “Josippon” was a romance\nrather than a history. Culled from all sources, from Strabo, Lucian, and\nEusebius, as well as from Josephus, this marvellous book exercised\nstrong influence on the Jewish imagination, and supplied an antidote to\nthe tribulations of the present by the consolations of the past and the\nvivid hopes for the future.",
        "For a long period Abraham Ibn Daud found no imitators. Jewish history\nwas written as part of the Jewish religion. Yet, incidentally, many\nhistorical passages were introduced in the works of Jewish scholars and\ntravellers, and the liturgy was enriched by many beautiful historical\nElegies, which were a constant call to heroism and fidelity. These\nElegies, or Selichoth, were composed throughout the Middle Ages, and\ntheir passionate outpourings of lamentation and trust give them a high\nplace in Jewish poetry. They are also important historically, and fully\njustify the fine utterance with which Zunz introduces them, an utterance\nwhich was translated by George Eliot as follows:",
        "     If there are ranks in suffering, Israel takes precedence of\n     all the nations–if the duration of sorrows and the patience\n     with which they are borne ennoble, the Jews are among the\n     aristocracy of every land–if a literature is called rich in\n     the possession of a few classic tragedies, what shall we say\n     to a National Tragedy lasting for fifteen hundred years, in\n     which the poets and the actors were also the heroes?",
        "The story of the medieval section of this pathetic martyrdom is written\nin the Selichoth and in the more prosaic records known as “Memorial\nBooks” (in German, Memorbücher), which are lists of martyrs and brief\neulogies of their careers.",
        "For the next formal history we must pass to Abraham Zacuto. In his old\nage he employed some years of comparative quiet, after a stormy and\nunhappy life, in writing a “Book of Genealogies” (Yuchasin). He had\nbeen exiled from Spain in 1492, and twelve years later composed his\nhistorical work in Tunis. Like Abraham Ibn Baud’s book, it opens with\nthe Creation, and ends with the author’s own day. Though Zacuto’s work\nis more celebrated than historical, it nevertheless had an important\nshare in reawaking the dormant interest of Jews in historical research.\nThus we find Elijah Kapsali of Candia writing, in 1523, a “History of\nthe Ottoman Empire,” and Joseph Cohen, of Avignon, a “History of France\nand Turkey,” in 1554, in which he included an account of the rebellion\nof Fiesco in Genoa, where the author was then residing.",
        "The sixteenth century witnessed the production of several popular Jewish\nhistories. At that epoch the horizon of the world was extending under\nnew geographical and intellectual discoveries. Israel, on the other\nhand, seemed to be sinking deeper and deeper into the slough of despond.\nSome of the men who had themselves been the victims of persecution saw\nthat the only hope lay in rousing the historical consciousness of their\nbrethren. History became the consolation of the exiles from Spain who\nfound themselves pent up within the walls of the Ghettos, which were\nfirst built in the sixteenth century. Samuel Usque was a fugitive from\nthe Inquisition, and his dialogues, “Consolations for the Tribulations\nof Israel” (written in Portuguese, in 1553), are a long drawn-out sigh\nof pain passing into a sigh of relief. Usque opens with a passionate\nidyl in which the history of Israel in the near past is told by the\nshepherd Icabo. To him Numeo and Zicareo offer consolation, and they\npour balm into his wounded heart. The vividness of Usque’s style, his\nhistorical insight, his sturdy optimism, his poetical force in\ninterpreting suffering as the means of attaining the highest life in\nGod, raise his book above the other works of its class and age.",
        "Usque’s poem did not win the same popularity as two other elegiac\nhistories of the same period. These were the “Rod of Judah” (Shebet\nJehudah) and the “Valley of Tears” (Emek ha-Bachah). The former was\nthe work of three generations of the Ibn Verga family. Judah died before\nthe expulsion from Spain, but his son Solomon participated in the final\ntroubles of the Spanish Jews, and was even forced to join the ranks of\nthe Marranos. The grandson, Joseph Ibn Verga, became Rabbi in\nAdrianople, and was cultured in classical as well as Jewish lore. Their\ncomposite work, “The Rod of Judah,” was completed in 1554. It is a\nwell-written but badly arranged martyrology, and over all its pages\nmight be inscribed the Talmudical motto, that God’s chastisements of\nIsrael are chastisements of love. The other work referred to is Joseph\nCohen’s “Valley of Tears,” completed in 1575. The author was born in\nAvignon in 1496, four years after his father had shared in the exile\nfrom Spain. He himself suffered expatriation, for, though a\ndistinguished physician and the private doctor of the Doge Andrea Doria,\nhe was expelled with the rest of the Jews from Genoa in 1550. Settled in\nthe little town of Voltaggio, he devoted himself to writing the annals\nof European and Jewish history. His style is clear and forcible, and\nrecalls the lucid simplicity of the historical books of the Bible.",
        "The only other histories that need be critically mentioned here are the\n“Branch of David” (Zemach David), the “Chain of Tradition\"\n(Shalsheleth ha-Kabbalah), and the “Light of the Eyes” (Meör\nEnayim). Abraham de Porta Leone’s “Shields of the Mighty” (Shilte\nha-Gibborim, printed in Mantua in 1612); Leon da Modena’s “Ceremonies\nand Customs of the Jews,” (printed in Paris in 1637); David Conforte’s\n“Call of the Generations” (Kore ha-Doroth, written in Palestine in\nabout 1670); Yechiel Heilprin’s “Order of Generations” (Seder\nha-Doroth, written in Poland in 1725); and Chayim Azulai’s “Name of the\nGreat Ones” (written in Leghorn in 1774), can receive only a bare\nmention.",
        "The author of the “Branch of David,” David Cans, was born in Westphalia\nin about 1540. He was the first German Jew of his age to take real\ninterest in the study of history. He was a man of scientific culture,\ncorresponded with Kepler, and was a personal friend of Tycho Brahe. For\nthe latter Cans made a German translation of parts of the Hebrew\nversion of the Tables of Alfonso, originally compiled in 1260. Cans\nwrote works on mathematical and physical geography, and treatises on\narithmetic and geometry. His history, “Branch of David,” was extremely\npopular. For a man of his scientific training it shows less critical\npower than might have been expected, but the German Jews did not begin\nto apply criticism to history till after the age of Mendelssohn. In one\nrespect, however, the “Branch of David” displays the width of the\nauthor’s culture. Not only does he tell the history of the Jews, but in\nthe second part of his work he gives an account of many lands and\ncities, especially of Bohemia and Prague, and adds a striking\ndescription of the secret courts (Vehmgerichte) of Westphalia.",
        "It is hard to think that the authors of the “Chain of Tradition” and of\nthe “Light of the Eyes” were contemporaries. Azariah di Rossi\n(1514-1588), the writer of the last mentioned book, was the founder of\nhistorical criticism among the Jews. Elias del Medigo (1463-1498) had\nled in the direction, but di Rossi’s work anticipated the methods, of\nthe German school of “scientific” Jewish writers, who, at the beginning\nof the present century, applied scientific principles to the study of\nJewish traditions. On the other hand, Gedaliah Ibn Yachya (1515-1587)\nwas so utterly uncritical that his “Chain of Tradition” was nicknamed by\nJoseph Delmedigo the “Chain of Lies.” Gedaliah was a man of wealth, and\nhe expended his means in the acquisition of books and in making journeys\nin search of sacred and profane knowledge. Yet Gedaliah made up in style\nfor his lack of historical method. The “Chain of Tradition” is a\npicturesque and enthralling book, it is a warm and cheery retrospect,\nand even deserves to be called a prose epic. Besides, many of his\nstatements that were wont to be treated as altogether unauthentic have\nbeen vindicated by later research. Azariah di Rossi, on the other hand,\nis immortalized by his spirit rather than his actual contributions to\nhistorical literature. He came of an ancient family said to have been\ncarried to Rome by Titus, and lived in Ferrara, where, in 1574, he\nproduced his “Light of the Eyes.” This is divided into three parts, the\nfirst devoted to general history, the second to the Letter of Aristeas,\nthe third to the solution of several historical problems, all of which\nhad been neglected by Jews and Christians alike. Azariah di Rossi was\nthe first critic to open up true lines of research into the Hellenistic\nliterature of the Jews of Alexandria. With him the true historical\nspirit once more descended on the Jewish genius.",
