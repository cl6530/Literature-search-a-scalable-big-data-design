        "We kept up a constant connection with the Presidio, and by the close\nof the summer I had added much to my vocabulary, beside having made\nthe acquaintance of nearly everybody in the place, and acquired some\nknowledge of the character and habits of the people, as well as of\nthe institutions under which they live.",
        "California was first discovered in 1536, by Cortes, and was subsequently\nvisited by numerous other adventurers as well as commissioned voyagers\nof the Spanish crown.  It was found to be inhabited by numerous tribes\nof Indians, and to be in many parts extremely fertile; to which, of course,\nwas added rumors of gold mines, pearl fishery, etc.  No sooner was the\nimportance of the country known, than the Jesuits obtained leave to\nestablish themselves in it, to Christianize and enlighten the Indians.\nThey established missions in various parts of the country toward the\nclose of the seventeenth century, and collected the natives about them,\nbaptizing them into the church, and teaching them the arts of civilized\nlife.  To protect the Jesuits in their missions, and at the same time\nto support the power of the crown over the civilized Indians, two\nforts were erected and garrisoned, one at San Diego, and the other\nat Monterey.  These were called Presidios, and divided the command of\nthe whole country between them.  Presidios have since been established\nat Santa Barbara and San Francisco; thus dividing the country into\nfour large districts, each with its presidio, and governed by the\ncommandant.  The soldiers, for the most part, married civilized\nIndians; and thus, in the vicinity of each presidio, sprung up,\ngradually, small towns.  In the course of time, vessels began to\ncome into the ports to trade with the missions, and received hides\nin return; and thus began the great trade of California.  Nearly all\nthe cattle in the country belonged to the missions, and they employed\ntheir Indians, who became, in fact, their slaves, in tending their\nvast herds.  In the year 1793, when Vancouver visited San Diego,\nthe mission had obtained great wealth and power, and are accused of\nhaving depreciated the country with the sovereign, that they might\nbe allowed to retain their possessions.  On the expulsion of the\nJesuits from the Spanish dominions, the missions passed into the\nhands of the Franciscans, though without any essential change in\ntheir management.  Ever since the independence of Mexico, the missions\nhave been going down; until, at last, a law was passed, stripping them\nof all their possessions, and confining the priests to their spiritual\nduties; and at the same time declaring all the Indians free and independent\nRancheros.  The change in the condition of the Indians was, as may be\nsupposed, only nominal: they are virtually slaves, as much as they\never were.  But in the missions, the change was complete.  The priests\nhave now no power, except in their religious character, and the great\npossessions of the missions are given over to be preyed upon by the\nharpies of the civil power, who are sent there in the capacity of\nadministradores, to settle up the concerns; and who usually end,\nin a few years, by making themselves fortunes, and leaving their\nstewardships worse than they found them.  The dynasty of the priests\nwas much more acceptable to the people of the country, and indeed,\nto every one concerned with the country, by trade or otherwise,\nthan that of the administradores.  The priests were attached\nperpetually to one mission, and felt the necessity of keeping up\nits credit.  Accordingly, their debts were regularly paid, and the\npeople were, in the main, well treated, and attached to those who\nhad spent their whole lives among them. But the administradores are\nstrangers sent from Mexico, having no interest in the country;\nnot identified in any way with their charge, and, for the most\npart, men of desperate fortunes–broken down politicians and\nsoldiers–whose only object is to retrieve their condition in\nas short a time as possible.  The change had been made but a few\nyears before our arrival upon the coast, yet, in that short time,\nthe trade was much diminished, credit impaired, and the venerable\nmissions going rapidly to decay.  The external arrangements remain\nthe same.  There are four presidios, having under their protection\nthe various missions, and pueblos, which are towns formed by the\ncivil power, and containing no mission or presidio.  The most\nnortherly presidio is San Francisco; the next Monterey; the next\nSanta Barbara; including the mission of the same, St. Louis Obispo,\nand St. Buenaventura, which is the finest mission in the whole\ncountry, having very fertile soil and rich vineyards.  The last,\nand most southerly, is San Diego, including the mission of the same,\nSan Juan Campestrano, the Pueblo de los Angelos, the largest town in\nCalifornia, with the neighboring mission of San Gabriel.  The priests\nin spiritual matters are subject to the Archbishop of Mexico, and in\ntemporal matters to the governor-general, who is the great civil and\nmilitary head of the country.",
        "The government of the country is an arbitrary democracy; having no\ncommon law, and no judiciary.  Their only laws are made and unmade at\nthe caprice of the legislature, and are as variable as the legislature\nitself.  They pass through the form of sending representatives to the\ncongress at Mexico, but as it takes several months to go and return,\nand there is very little communication between the capital and this\ndistant province, a member usually stays there, as permanent member,\nknowing very well that there will be revolutions at home before he\ncan write and receive an answer; if another member should be sent,\nhe has only to challenge him, and decide the contested election in\nthat way.",
        "Revolutions are matters of constant occurrence in California.\nThey are got up by men who are at the foot of the ladder and in\ndesperate circumstances, just as a new political party is started\nby such men in our own country.  The only object, of course, is the\nloaves and fishes; and instead of caucusing, paragraphing, libelling,\nfeasting, promising, and lying, as with us, they take muskets and\nbayonets, and seizing upon the presidio and custom-house, divide the\nspoils, and declare a new dynasty.  As for justice, they know no law\nbut will and fear.  A Yankee, who had been naturalized, and become a\nCatholic, and had married in the country, was sitting in his house at\nthe Pueblo de los Angelos, with his wife and children, when a Spaniard,\nwith whom he had had a difficulty, entered the house, and stabbed\nhim to the heart before them all.  The murderer was seized by some\nYankees who had settled there, and kept in confinement until a\nstatement of the whole affair could be sent to the governor-general.\nHe refused to do anything about it, and the countrymen of the\nmurdered man, seeing no prospect of justice being administered,\nmade known that if nothing was done, they should try the man\nthemselves.  It chanced that, at this time, there was a company\nof forty trappers and hunters from Kentucky, with their rifles,\nwho had made their head-quarters at the Pueblo; and these,\ntogether with the Americans and Englishmen in the place, who were\nbetween twenty and thirty in number, took possession of the town,\nand waiting a reasonable time, proceeded to try the man according to\nthe forms in their own country.  A judge and jury were appointed,\nand he was tried, convicted, sentenced to be shot, and carried out\nbefore the town, with his eyes blindfolded.  The names of all\nthe men were then put into a hat and each one pledging himself\nto perform his duty, twelve names were drawn out, and the men\ntook their stations with their rifles, and, firing at the word,\nlaid him dead.  He was decently buried, and the place was restored\nquietly to the proper authorities.  A general, with titles enough\nfor an hidalgo, was at San Gabriel, and issued a proclamation\nas long as the fore-top-bowline, threatening destruction to\nthe rebels, but never stirred from his fort; for forty Kentucky\nhunters, with their rifles, were a match for a whole regiment of\nhungry, drawling, lazy half-breeds.  This affair happened while\nwe were at San Pedro, (the port of the Pueblo,) and we had all\nthe particulars directly from those who were on the spot.  A few\nmonths afterwards, another man, whom we had often seen in San Diego,\nmurdered a man and his wife on the high road between the Pueblo and\nSan Louis Rey, and the foreigners not feeling themselves called upon\nto act in this case, the parties being all natives, nothing was done\nabout it; and I frequently afterwards saw the murderer in San Diego,\nwhere he was living with his wife and family.",
        "When a crime has been committed by Indians, justice, or rather\nvengeance, is not so tardy.  One Sunday afternoon, while I was\nat San Diego, an Indian was sitting on his horse, when another,\nwith whom he had had some difficulty, came up to him, drew a long knife,\nand plunged it directly into the horse’s heart.  The Indian sprang\nfrom his falling horse, drew out the knife, and plunged it into\nthe other Indian’s breast, over his shoulder, and laid him dead.\nThe poor fellow was seized at once, clapped into the calabozo,\nand kept there until an answer could be received from Monterey.\nA few weeks afterwards, I saw the poor wretch, sitting on the\nbare ground, in front of the calabozo, with his feet chained to\na stake, and handcuffs about his wrists.  I knew there was very\nlittle hope for him.  Although the deed was done in hot blood,\nthe horse on which he was sitting being his own, and a great\nfavorite, yet he was an Indian, and that was enough.  In about a\nweek after I saw him, I heard that he had been shot.  These few\ninstances will serve to give one a notion of the distribution of\njustice in California.",
        "In their domestic relations, these people are no better than in their\npublic.  The men are thriftless, proud, and extravagant, and very\nmuch given to gaming; and the women have but little education,\nand a good deal of beauty, and their morality, of course, is none of\nthe best; yet the instances of infidelity are much less frequent than\none would at first suppose.  In fact, one vice is set over against\nanother; and thus, something like a balance is obtained.  The women\nhave but little virtue, but then the jealousy of their husbands is\nextreme, and their revenge deadly and almost certain.  A few inches\nof cold steel has been the punishment of many an unwary man, who has\nbeen guilty, perhaps, of nothing more than indiscretion of manner.\nThe difficulties of the attempt are numerous, and the consequences\nof discovery fatal.  With the unmarried women, too, great watchfulness\nis used.  The main object of the parents is to marry their daughters\nwell, and to this, the slightest slip would be fatal.  The sharp eyes\nof a dueña, and the cold steel of a father or brother, are a protection\nwhich the characters of most of them–men and women–render by no means\nuseless; for the very men who would lay down their lives to avenge the\ndishonor of their own family, would risk the same lives to complete\nthe dishonor of another.",
        "Of the poor Indians, very little care is taken.  The priests,\nindeed, at the missions, are said to keep them very strictly,\nand some rules are usually made by the alcaldes to punish their\nmisconduct; but it all amounts to but little.  Indeed, to show the\nentire want of any sense of morality or domestic duty among them,\nI have frequently known an Indian to bring his wife, to whom he\nwas lawfully married in the church, down to the beach, and carry\nher back again, dividing with her the money which she had got\nfrom the sailors.  If any of the girls were discovered by the\nalcalde to be open evil-livers, they were whipped, and kept at\nwork sweeping the square of the presidio, and carrying mud and\nbricks for the buildings; yet a few reáls would generally buy\nthem off.  Intemperance, too, is a common vice among the Indians.\nThe Spaniards, on the contrary, are very abstemious, and I do not\nremember ever having seen a Spaniard intoxicated.",
        "Such are the people who inhabit a country embracing four or five\nhundred miles of sea-coast, with several good harbors; with fine\nforests in the north; the waters filled with fish, and the plains\ncovered with thousands of herds of cattle; blessed with a climate,\nthan which there can be no better in the world; free from all\nmanner of diseases, whether epidemic or endemic; and with a soil\nin which corn yields from seventy to eighty fold.  In the hands\nof an enterprising people, what a country this might be! we are\nready to say.  Yet how long would a people remain so, in such a\ncountry?  The Americans (as those from the United States are\ncalled) and Englishmen, who are fast filling up the principal\ntowns, and getting the trade into their hands, are indeed more\nindustrious and effective than the Spaniards; yet their children\nare brought up Spaniards, in every respect, and if the “California\nfever” (laziness) spares the first generation, it always attacks\nthe second.",
