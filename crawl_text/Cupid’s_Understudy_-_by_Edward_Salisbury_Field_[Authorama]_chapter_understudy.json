        "If Dad had been a coal baron, like Mr. Tudor Carstairs, or a stock-\nwatering captain of industry, like Mrs. Sanderson-Spear’s husband,\nor descended from a long line of whisky distillers, like Mrs.\nCarmichael Porter, why, then his little Elizabeth would have been\nallowed the to sit in seat of the scornful with the rest of the Four\nHundred, and this story would never have been written. But Dad\nwasn’t any of these things; he was just an old love who had made\nseven million dollars by the luckiest fluke in the world.",
        "Everybody in southern California knew it was a fluke, too, so the\nseven millions came in for all the respect that would otherwise have\nfallen to Dad. Of course we were celebrities, in a way, but in a\nvery horrid way. Dad was Old Tom Middleton, who used to keep a\nlivery-stable in San Bernardino, and I was Old Tom Middleton’s girl,\n\"who actually used to live over a livery-stable, my dear!” It sounds\nfearfully sordid, doesn’t it?",
        "But it wasn’t sordid, really, for I never actually lived over a\nstable. Indeed, we had the sweetest cottage in all San Bernardino. I\nremember it so well: the long, cool porch, the wonderful gold-of-\nOphir roses, the honeysuckle where the linnets nested, the mocking\nbirds that sang all night long; the perfume of the jasmine, of the\norange-blossoms, the pink flame of the peach trees in April, the\never-changing color of the mountains. And I remember Ninette, my\nlittle Creole mother, gay as a butterfly, carefree as a meadow-lark.\n’Twas she who planted the jasmine.",
        "My little mother died when I was seven years old. Dad and I and my\nold black mammy, Rachel, stayed on in the cottage. The mocking-birds\nstill sang, and the linnets still nested in the honeysuckle, but\nnothing was ever quite the same again. It was like a different\nworld; it was a different world. There were gold-of-Ophir roses,\nand, peach blossoms in April, but there was no more jasmine; Dad had\nit all dug up. To this day he turns pale at the sight of it—poor\nDad!",
        "When I was twelve years old, Dad sold out his hardware business,\nintending to put his money in an orange grove at Riverside, but the\nnicest livery-stable in San Bernardino happened to be for sale just\nthen, so he bought that instead, for he was always crazy about\nhorses.",
        "To see me trotting about in Paquin gowns and Doucet models, you’d\nnever think I owed them to three owlish little burros, would you?\nBut it’s a fact. When Dad took over the livery-stable, he found he\nwas the proud possessor of three donkeys, as well as some twenty-odd\nhorses, and a dozen or so buggies, buckboards and surries. The\nburros ate their solemn heads off all winter, but in May it had been\nthe custom to send them to Strawberry Valley in charge of a Mexican\nwho hired them out to the boarders at the summer hotel there.\nLuckily for us, when Fortune came stalking down the main street of\nSan Bernardino to knock at the door of the Golden Eagle Stables,\nboth dad and the burros were at home. If either had been out, we\nmight be poor this very minute.",
        "It is generally understood that when Fortune goes a-visiting, she\ngoes disguised, so it’s small wonder Dad didn’t recognize her at\nfirst. She wasn’t even a “her\"; she was a he, a great, awkward Swede\nwith mouse-colored hair and a Yon Yonsen accent—you know the kind—\nslow to anger; slow to everything, without “j” in his alphabet—by\nthe name of Olaf Knutsen.",
        "Now Olaf was a dreamer. Not the conventional sort of a dreamer, who\nsees beauty in everything but an honest day’s work, but a brawny,\npick-swinging dreamer who had dug holes in the ground at the end of\nmany rainbows. That he had never yet uncovered the elusive pot of\ngold didn’t seem to bother him in the least; for him, that tender\nplant called Hope flowered perennially. And now he was bent on\nfollowing another rainbow; a rainbow which; arching over the\nmountains, ended in that arid, pitiless waste known in the south\ncountry as Death Valley.",
        "He wouldn’t fail this time. No, by Yimminy! With Dad’s three burros,\nand plenty of bacon and beans and water—it was to be a grub-stake,\nof course—he would make both their fortunes. And the beautiful part\nabout it was, he did.",
        "No doubt you have heard of the famous Golden Eagle mine. Well,\nthat’s what Olaf and the three burros found in Death Valley. Good\nold Olaf! He named the mine after Dad’s livery-stable in San\nBernardino, and he insisted on keeping only a half interest, even\nthough Dad fought him about it. You see, Dad didn’t have the\nreputation of being the squarest man in San Bernardino for nothing.",
        "My mother’s family had never approved of her marriage with Dad, but\nDad, poor and running a hardware shop or a livery-stable, and Dad\nwith a fortune in his hands were two very different people—from\ntheir standpoint, at least; so as soon as Olaf and the three burros\nstruck it rich, Dad sold his livery-stable, and mammy Rachel and I\nwere bundled off to Ninette’s relations in New Orleans. I didn’t\nlike it a bit at first, but one can get used to anything in time.\nNinette’s maiden sister, Miss Marie Madeline Antoinette Hortense\nPrevost, was awfully nice to me; so was grandmere Prevost. I lived\nwith them till I was sixteen, when I was sent to France.",
        "If I wanted to (and you would let me) I could personally conduct you\nto Paris, where if you were ten feet tall and not averse to staring,\nyou could look over a certain gray stone wall on the Boulevard des\nInvalides, and see me pacing sedately up and down the gravel walks\nin the garden of the Convent of the Sacred Heart. That is, you could\nhave seen me three years ago. I’m not there now, thank goodness! I’m\nin California.",
        "And just one word before we go any further any further. I don’t want\nyou to think for a minute that I came back from Paris a little\nFrenchified miss. No, indeed! I’m as American as they make them.\nWhen I boasted to the other girls, whether in Paris or New Orleans,\nI always boasted about two things: Dad and California. And I’ve an\nidea I’ll go on boasting about them till my dying day.",
        "Of course, when I returned from Paris, Dad met me in New York. It\nwas a good thing he was rich, for it took a lot of money to get me\nand my seven trunks through the custom-house. It might have taken\nmore, though, if it hadn’t been for a young man who came over on the\nsame boat.",
        "He was such a good-looking young man; tall and broad-shouldered and\nfair, with light-brown hair, and the nicest eyes you ever saw. It\nwasn’t their color so much (his eyes were blue) as the way they\nlooked at you that made them so attractive. He was awfully well\nbred, too! He noticed me a lot on the boat (I had a perfect love of\na Redfern coat to wear on deck), but he didn’t try to scrape\nacquaintance with me. He worshipped from afar (a woman can always\ntell when a man’s thinking about her), and while I wouldn’t have had\nhim act otherwise for the world, I was crazy to have him speak to\nme.",
        "Our boat docked at Hoboken, and by tipping right and left I managed\nto be the very first passenger down the gangway. I half ran, half\nslid, but I landed in Dad’s arms.",
        "My boxes and bags passed through the custom-house with flying\ncolors. But my trunks—I couldn’t even find them all. Five of them\nwere stacked in the “M” division, but the other two. . . . Then\nthere was my maid’s trunk to look for under the “V’s” (her name is\nValentine). Dad and I were commencing at “A,” prepared to got\nthrough the whole alphabet, if necessary, when the nice young man\nstepped up and, raising his hat, asked if he might be of any\nservice. He asked Dad, but he looked at me.",
        "“Oh, If you please!” I said “I’ve lost two trunks. My brand is a\nwhite, ’M’ in a red circle.”",
        "“I noticed them in the ’R’ pile” he replied. “I’ll have them moved\nto the ’M’s’ right away.”",
        "“Now that’s what I call being decent,” said Dad, as soon as the\nyoung man had left us. “Did you notice, he didn’t wear a uniform?\nProbably an inspector, or something of the sort, eh, Elizabeth?”",
        "“Well—er—not exactly,” I managed to say. “The fact is, Dad, he\ncame over on the boat with me, and—”",
        "Dad looked thoughtful.",
        "“He never spoke to me once the whole trip,” I added hastily.",
        "Dad looked less thoughtful.",
        "“It was nice of him to wait till I had you with me, wasn’t it?”",
        "Dad smiled. “If you think it was, it probably was, my dear,” he\nsaid.",
        "The nice young man did more than find my missing trunks; he found a\ncustom-house officer, and, after asking me privately which trunks\ncontained my most valuable possessions and how much I had thought of\ndeclaring, he succeeded in having them passed through on my own\nvaluation without any undue exposure of their contents.",
        "By this time Dad had grown very respectful. To see his little\nElizabeth treated like a queen, while on all sides angry women were\nhaving their best gowns pawed over and mussed; was a most wholesome\nlesson. He paid the thousand and odd dollars duty like a little man.",
        "We’d been saved a lot of bother, and nobody hates a lot of bother\nmore than Dad. So when the trunks were locked and strapped and ready\nto be sent to our hotel, Dad went up to the nice young man and said:\n\"I’m Tom Middleton, from California, and this is my daughter\nElizabeth. We’re both very grateful to you, and if you should ever\nhappen to come to California, I hope you’ll look us up.”",
        "That’s Dad all over!",
        "I never saw anybody look so pleased as the young man: “My name’s\nPorter,” he said, “Blakely Porter. If my mother were in New York I\nwould ask if she might call on Miss Middleton, but, as it happens,\nshe’s in California, where I intend to join her, so I shall look\nforward to seeing you there.”",
        "Then Dad did just the right thing. “What’s the use of waiting till\nwe get to California?” he said. “Why not dine with us to-night!”",
        "There are people, merely conventional people, who could never\nappreciate the fine directness and simplicity, of Dad’s nature—not\nif they lived to be a thousand years old. But Mr. Blakely Porter\nunderstood perfectly; I know he did, for he told me so afterwards.\n\"It was the greatest compliment I ever had paid me in my life,” he\nsaid. “Your father knew nothing about me, absolutely nothing, yet he\ninvited me to dine with him—and you. It was splendid, splendid!”",
        "The dear boy didn’t know, perhaps, that honesty shone in his eyes,\nthat one could not look at him and deny he was a gentleman. And, of\ncourse, I didn’t enlighten him, for it is well for men,\nparticularly, young men, to feel grateful, and the least bit humble;\nit keeps them from being spoiled.",
        "But to return to the dinner invitation: Mr. Porter accepted it\neagerly. “It is more than kind of you,” he said. “My mother is away,\nand her house is closed. It is my first home-coming in four years,\nand I should have been lonely to-night.”",
        "And poor Dad, who has been lonely—oh, so lonely!—ever since\nNinette died, shook hands with him, and said: “If my daughter and I\ncan keep you from feeling lonely, we shall be so. glad. We are\nstopping at The Plaza, and we dine at half past seven.”",
        "Then Mr. Porter found us a taxi-cab, and away we went.",
        "It was good to be in America again. I made Dad stop the car, and\nhave the top put back, even though it was freezing cold, for I had\nnever been in New York before (when I’d gone to France, I had sailed\nfrom New Orleans) and I wanted to see everything. The tall\nbuildings, the elevated, even the bad paving till we got to Fifth\nAvenue, interested me immensely, as they would any one to whom.\nParis had been home, and New York a foreign city. Not that I had\never thought of Paris as my real home; home was, where my heart was-\n-with Dad. I tried to make him understand how, happy I was to be\nwith him, how I had missed him, and California.",
        "“So you missed your old father; did you, girlie?”",
        "“Yes, Dad.”",
        "“And you’ll be glad to go to California?”",
        "“Oh, so glad!”",
        "“Then,” said Dad, “we’ll start tomorrow.”",
        "Our rooms at the hotel were perfect; there was a bed room and bath\nfor me a bed room and bath for Dad, with a sitting room between, all\nfacing the Park. And there were roses everywhere; huge American\nBeauties, dear, wee, pink roses, roses of flaming red. I turned to\nDad, who was standing in the middle of the sitting room, beaming at\nme. “You delightful old spendthrift!” I cried. “What do you mean by\nbuying millions of roses? And in the middle of January too! You\ndeserve to be disciplined, and you shall be.”",
        "“Discipline is an excellent thing; even if it does disturb the set\nof one’s tie,” Dad remarked thoughtfully, a moment later.",
        "“I couldn’t help hugging you, Daddy.”",
        "“My dear, that hug of yours was the sweetest thing that has happened\nto your dad in many a long year.”",
        "And then, of course, I had to hug him again.",
        "After luncheon (we had it in our sitting room) Dad asked if I would\nenjoy a drive through the Park.",
        "“I should enjoy it immensely,” I said, “but I can’t possibly go.”",
        "You see, there was a trunk to unpack, the one holding my prettiest\ndinner gown. Of course Valentine was quite capable of attending to\nthe unpacking. Still, one likes to inspect everything one is to\nwear, especially when one is expecting a guest to dinner. “Then,\"\nsaid Dad, “I think I’ll order dinner, and go for a walk., shall we\nhave dinner here?”",
        "“Oh, by all means! This is so much more homelike than a public\ndining room.”",
        "“I’ll not be gone more than an hour or two. . . Hullo! Come in.”",
        "A small boy entered, carrying a box quite as big as himself. “For\nMiss Middleton,” he said.",
        "“Another present from you, Dad?”",
        "“Open it, my dear.”",
        "“I thought so,” he remarked, as the removal of the cover displayed\nmore American Beauties. (There were five dozen;) I counted them\nafter Dad had gone. Another million roses and in the middle of\nJanuary! “Who’s the spendthrift this time, Elizabeth?”",
        "“His name,” I said, slipping a card: from the envelope that lay on a\nhuge bow of red ribbon, “is Mr. Blakely Porter.”",
        "Although I know, now, there are many things more beautiful, I\nbelieved, then, that nothing more beautiful had ever happened; for\nit was the first time a man had ever sent me roses. Nineteen years\nold, and my first roses! They made me so happy. Paris seemed very\nfar away; the convent was a mythical place I had seen in a dream;\nnothing was real but Dad, and America, and the roses somebody, had\nsent. Somebody!",
        "Mr. Porter arrived on time to the minute, looking perfectly splendid\nin a wonderful furlined coat. And if his eyes were anxious, and his\nmanner a bit constrained at first, it didn’t last long; Dad’s\ngreeting was too cordial, not to make him feel at home. Indeed, he\ntalked delightfully all through dinner, and with the coffee, half\nlaughingly, half apologizingly told us the story of his life. “For,\"\nsaid he, “although I feel as if I’d known you always,” (he looked at\nDad, but I was sure he meant me, too) “you may not feel the same in\nregard to me—and I want you to.”",
        "It was sweet to see Dad grow almost boyish in his insistence that he\nfelt as Mr. Porter did. “Nonsense!” he said. “It seems the most\nnatural thing in the world to have you here. Doesn’t it Elizabeth!”",
        "It was rather embarrassing to be asked such a question in Mr.\nPorter’s presence, but I managed to murmur a weak “Yes, indeed!\"\nInside, though, I felt just as Dad did, and I was fearfully\ninterested in Mr. Porter’s account of himself. I could see, too,\nthat he belittled the real things, and magnified the unimportant.\nAccording to his narrative, the unimportant things were that he was\na civil engineer, that he had been in Peru building a railroad for\nan English; syndicate, and that the railroad was now practically\ncompleted; he seemed, however, to attach great importance to the\ncable that had called him to London to appear before a board of\ndirectors, for that had been the indirect means of his taking\npassage on the same ship with me. Then there was the wonderful fact\nthat he was to see us in California. He had been in harness now for\nfour years, he said, and he felt as if he’d earned a vacation. At\nall events, he meant to take one.",
        "As neither he nor Dad would hear of my leaving them to their cigars,\nI sat by and listened, and loved it all, every minute of it. I\ndidn’t know, then (I don’t know to this day) whether I liked Mr.\nPorter best for being so boyish, or so manly. But manly men who\nretain all the enthusiasms of youth have a certain charm one likes\ninstinctively, I think.",
        "There is no doubt that Mr. Porter quite captivated Dad. “You make me\nfeel like a boy,” he said, after listening to a delightfully\nwhimsical account of conditions in Peru. “By George, that’s a\ncountry for you! And Ecuador, I’ve always thought that must be an\ninteresting place. Have you ever been there?”",
        "Yes, Mr. Porter had been to Ecuador. And there was a certain rail-\nroad in India he had helped put through. India! Now that WAS a\nplace! Had Dad ever been to India?",
        "No, Dad had never been to India, but . . . “Good Lord, boy, how old\nare you, anyway?”",
        "“Thirty-two.”",
        "“Well, I never would have guessed it. Would you, Elizabeth?”",
        "This, too, was rather embarrassing, but I managed to say I thought\nMr. Porter didn’t look a day over twenty-eight.",
        "“It’s the life he leads,” Dad declared with an air of\nproprietorship—\"out of doors all day long. It must be great!”",
        "“It IS interesting. But I think I like it best for what it has done\nfor one; you see, I was supposed to have lungs once, long ago. Now\nI’m as sound as a dollar.”",
        "“He looks it, doesn’t he, Elizabeth!”",
        "If Dad hadn’t been such a dear, I should have been annoyed by his\nconstant requests for my opinion where it was so obviously\nunnecessary. But Dad is such a dear. To make it worse, Mr. Porter\nseemed to consider that whether he was, or was not, as sound as a\ndollar, depended entirely on my answer.",
        "“One would think I was a sort of supreme court from the way Dad\nrefers all questions to me. But I warn you, Mr. Porter; my ’yes’ or\n’no’ makes little difference in his opinions.”",
        "“You are my supreme court, and they do,” declared Dad.",
        "“I’m sure they do,” said Mr. Porter,",
        "“When the novelty of having me with you has worn off, you’ll be your\nsame old domineering self, Daddy dear.”",
        "“Domineering! Hear the minx! I’m a regular lamb, Porter. That\nreminds me: When are you going to California!”",
        "“I hadn’t thought. That is, I had thought . . . That is, I’ve wished\n. . . I mean I’ve wondered . . . I hope you won’t think me\npresumptuous, Mr. Middleton, but I’ve wondered if you’d allow me to\ngo on the same train with you and Miss Middleton.”",
        "“Why, my dear boy, we’d be delighted. Wouldn’t we, Elizabeth!”",
        "Mr. Porter turned to me. “You see, Miss Middleton, you are the\nsupreme court, after all,” his lips said. But his eyes told me why\nhe wanted to go on the same train with Dad and me, told me plainer\nthan words. Perhaps I should have remembered I had never spoken to\nhim till that morning, but . . .",
        "“The supreme court congratulates the inferior court on the wisdom of\nits decision,” I said, with an elaborate bow to Dad to hide my\nconfusion.",
        "“It’s settled!” cried Dad. “This is quite the nicest thing that ever\nhappened,” said Mr. Porter. “If only you knew how grateful I am. I\nfeel like—like giving three cheers, and tossing my hat in the air.”",
        "“The inferior court rules against hat-tossing as irrelevant,\nimmaterial, and incompetent.”",
        "“Ruling sustained,” I said.",
        "“And they call this a free country!”",
        "“The newspapers don’t. Read the newspapers my boy.”",
        "“At any rate, I now belong to the privileged class. When do we\nleave, Mr. Middleton?”",
        "“Elizabeth says to-morrow. We go by rather a slow train.”",
        "“But why?” I began.",
        "“Because, my dear, an all-wise Providence has decreed that express\ntrains shall not haul private cars.”",
        "“Oh, I say!” exclaimed Mr. Porter. “That makes all the difference in\nthe world.”",
        "“Only a day’s difference.”",
        "“I mean . . .”",
        "“You’re going as our guest, you know.”",
        "“But really, Mr. Middleton, I never . . .”",
        "“Don’t be absurd, my boy.”",
        "“No,” said Mr. Blakely Porter, “I won’t be absurd. I shall be more\nthan glad to go as your guest.”",
        "“That’s the way it should be. Isn’t it, Elizabeth!”",
        "“I didn’t know you owned a private car, Dad.”",
        "“Pshaw!” said Dad. “What’s a private car?”",
        "I smiled at what I was pleased to term “Dad’s magnificence,” little\nthinking I was soon to look on private cars as one of the most\ndelectable of modern inventions.",
        "Our train left Grand Central Station at two o’clock next afternoon;\nit was bitter cold, I remember, and I drove to the station,\nsmothered in furs. But our car was wonderfully cozy and comfortable,\nand it warmed my heart to see how proud Dad was of it: I must\ninspect the kitchen; this was my stateroom, did I like it? I mustn’t\njudge Amos by his appearance, but the way he could cook—he was a\nwonder at making griddle cakes. Did I still like griddle cakes? “And\ndo look at the books and magazines Mr. Porter brought. And a box of\nchocolates, too. Wasn’t it kind of him?” Dear Dad! He was like a\nchild with a new toy.",
        "I’m sure he enjoyed every minute of the trip. Mr. Porter played\ncribbage with him (Dad adores cribbage) by the hour; they talked\nrailroads, and politics, and mining—I don’t think Dad had been so\nhappy in years. I know I had never been so happy, for I was sure Mr.\nPorter loved me. I couldn’t help being sure; his heart was in his\neyes every time he looked at me.",
        "When we started from New York, we were Mr. Middleton, and Mr.\nPorter, and Miss Middleton to one another; at Chicago, it was Tom,\nand Blakely, and Miss Middleton; I became Elizabeth in Utah (I made\nhim call me that. And when we reached Nevada . . .",
        "It happened so naturally, so sweetly. Dad was taking a nap after\nluncheon, and Blakely and I were sitting on the rear platform of our\ncar, the last car in the train. It was a heavenly day of blue sky\nand sunshine; the desert was fresh from recent rain. And then a few,\ndear, faltered words changed the desert into a garden that reached\nto the rim of the world.",
        "“I love you. I didn’t mean to tell you quite yet, but I . . .\nI . . .”",
        "“I know. And it makes me so happy.”",
        "You never saw anybody so delighted as Dad was when we told him.\n\"This makes me glad clear through,” he said. “Blakely, boy, I\ncouldn’t love you more if you were my own son. Elizabeth, girl, come\nand kiss your old Daddy.”",
        "“And you aren’t surprised, Dad?”",
        "“Not a bit.”",
        "“He’s known I’ve loved you, all along. Haven’t you, Tom?”",
        "“I may have suspected it.”",
        "“But I’m sure he never dreamed I could possibly care for you,” I\nsaid. And then, because I was too happy to do anything else, I went\nto my state-room, and had a good cry.",
        "I have read somewhere that Love would grow old were it not for the\ntears of happy women.",
        "When we flew down the grade into California, everything seemed settled;\nwe were going to Santa Barbara where Dad was building a little palace\nfor his Elizabeth as a grand surprise (Blakely’s mother was in Santa\nBarbara); we would take rooms at the same hotel; I would be presented\nto Mrs. Porter, and as soon as the palace on the hill was completed—a\nmatter of two or three months—Blakely, and Dad, and I would move into\nit. Only, first, Blakely and I were going to San Bernardino on our\nwedding trip.",
        "Wasn’t that sweet of Blakely? When I told him about San Bernardino,\nand the livery-stable, and the cottage where Dad and I used to live,\nhe said he’d rather spend our honeymoon there than any place in the\nworld. Of course Dad had never sold the cottage, and it was touching\nto see how pleased he was with our plan.",
        "“You’ll find everything in first-class condition,” he said; “I go\nthere often myself. I built a little house in one corner of the\ngarden for the caretakers. You should see that gold-of-Ophir rose,\nElizabeth; it has grown beyond belief.”",
        "When we reached Oakland—where our car had to be switched off and\nattached to a coast line, train—we found we had four hours to kill,\nso Dad and Blakely and I (it was Blakely’s idea) caught the boat\nacross to San Francisco.",
        "What do you suppose that dear boy wanted us to go over there for?\nAnd where do you suppose he took us? He took us straight to\nShreve’s, and he and Dad spent a beautiful two hours in choosing an\nengagement ring for me. So when we finally landed in Santa Barbara I\nwas wearing a perfect love of a ruby on the third finger of my left\nhand. I was wearing my heart on my sleeve, too; I didn’t care if all\nthe world saw that I adored Blakely. We arrived in Santa Barbara in\nthe morning, and it was arranged that Blakely should lunch with his\nmother and devote himself to her during the afternoon, but he was to\ndine with us in our rooms. Naturally, I had a lot to do, supervising\nthe unpacking of my clothes, and straightening things about in our\nsitting-room so that it wouldn’t look too hotelish. Then Dad\nwouldn’t be happy till I’d inspected my new palace on the hill.",
        "It was an alarming looking pile. If anybody but Dad had been\nresponsible for it, I should have said it was hideous. Poor old Dad!\nHe knows absolutely nothing about architecture. But of course I\nraved over it, and, really, when I came to examine it closer, I\nfound it had its good points. Covered with vines, it would have been\nactually beautiful. Virginia creeper grows like mad in California\nand with English ivy and Lady Banksia roses to help out, I was sure\nI could transform my palace into a perfect. bower in almost no time.\nI was awfully glad I had seen it first, for now. I could break the\nbad news gently to Blakely. If I were a man, I couldn’t love a girl\nwho owned such a hideous house.",
        "But I didn’t have a chance to talk house to Blakely for some time.\nWhen he came in to dinner that night he looked awfully depressed; he\nbrightened up a lot, though, when he saw me. I had on my most\nbecoming gown, and Dad had ordered a grand dinner, including his own\nspecial brand of Burgundy. If Dad knew as much about architecture as\nhe does about wine, they’d insist on his designing all the buildings\nfor the next world’s fair.",
        "All through dinner Blakely wasn’t quite himself—I could see it; I\nthink Dad saw it, too-but I knew he would tell us what was the\nmatter as soon as he had an opportunity. One, of the sweetest things\nabout Blakely is his perfect frankness. I couldn’t love a man who\nwasn’t frank with me. That is, I suppose I could, but I should hate\nto; it would break my heart. Well, after dinner, when Dad had\nlighted his cigar, and Blakely his cigarette, it all came out.",
        "“Tom!”",
        "“Yes, my boy.” (I think Dad loved to hear Blakely say Tom almost as\nmuch as I loved to hear him say Elizabeth.)",
        "“Tom, I’ve got you and Elizabeth into a deuce of an unpleasant\nposition. I’ve told you what a fine woman my mother is, and how\nshe’d welcome Elizabeth with open arms, and now I find I was all\nwrong. My mother isn’t a fine woman; she’s an ancestor-worshiping,\nheartless, selfish snob. I’m ashamed of her, Tom. She refuses to\nmeet Elizabeth.”",
        "I never was so sorry for anybody in my whole life as I was for\nBlakely; I would have done anything to have saved him the bitterness\nand humiliation of that moment. As for Dad, he couldn’t understand\nit at all. That Blakely’s mother should refuse to meet his Elizabeth\nwas quite beyond his comprehension.",
        "“This is very strange,” he said, “very strange. There must be some\nmistake. Why shouldn’t she meet Elizabeth?”",
        "“There is no reason in the world,” Blakely answered.",
        "“Then why—?”",
        "“She probably has other plans for her son, Daddy dear,” I said. “And\nno doubt she has heard that we’re fearfully vulgar.”",
        "“Well, we ain’t,” said Dad in a relieved voice; “and as for those\nplans of hers, I reckon she’ll have to outgrow them. Buck up, my\nboy! One look at Elizabeth will show her she’s mistaken”",
        "“You don’t know my mother,” Blakely replied; “I feel that I haven’t\nknown her till now. It’s out of the question, our staying here after\nwhat has happened. Let’s go up to Del Monte, and let’s not wait four\nmonths for the wedding. Why can’t we be married this week? I’m done\nwith my mother and with the whole tribe of Porters; they’re not my\nkind, and you and Elizabeth are.”",
        "“Tom, I never felt, that I had a father till I found you. Elizabeth,\ngirl, I never knew what happiness was till you told me you loved me.\nMy mother says she would never consent to her son’s marrying the\ndaughter of a man who has kept a livery-stable. I say that I’m done\nwith a family that made its money out of whisky. My mother’s father\nwas a distiller, her grandfather was a distiller, and if there’s any\nshame, it’s mine, for by all the standards of decency, a livery-\nstable is a hundred times more respectable than a warehouse full of\nwhisky. You made your money honestly, but ours has been wrung out of\nthe poor, the sick, the ragged, the distressed. The whisky business\nis a rotten business, Tom, rotten!”",
        "“It was whisky that bought an ambassadorship for my mother’s\nbrother; it was whisky that paid for the French count my sister\nmarried; it was whisky that sent me to college. Whisky, whisky-\nalways whisky!”",
        "“I never thought twice about it before, but I’ve done some tall\nthinking today. I’m done with the Porters, root and branch.\nElizabeth and I are going to start a little family tree, of our own,\nand we’re not going to root it in a whisky barrel, either. We’re—\nwe’re—”",
        "“There, there!” said Dad. “It’s all right, Blakely, boy. It ain’t so\nbad as you think. You ain’t going to throw your mother over and your\nmother ain’t going to throw you over. I take it that all mothers are\nalike; they love their sons. Naturally, you’re sore and disappointed\nnow, but I reckon that mother of yours is sore and disappointed,\ntoo. As for our going to Del Monte, I never heard of a Middleton yet\nthat cut and ran at a time like this, and Elizabeth and I ain’t\ngoing to start any precedent.”",
        "“No, my boy, we’re going to stay right here, and you’re going to\nstay here with us. There’s lots of good times ahead for you and\nElizabeth, and in the meantime, I want you to be mighty sweet to\nthat mother of yours. She’s the only mother you’ve got, boy. You\ndon’t know what it means for us old folks to be disappointed in our\nchildren. Now, don’t disappoint me, lad. You be nice to that mother\nof yours, and keep on loving Elizabeth, and it will all come right,\nyou see if it don’t. If it don’t come one way, it will come another;\nyou can take my word for it.” As if Dad knew anything about it. He\nthought then that every woman possessed a sweet mind and a loving\nheart; he thinks so now. But one glimpse of Blakely’s mother was\nenough for me. She had a heart of stone; everything about her was\nmilitant, uncompromising; her eyes were of a piercing, steely blue;\nthe gowns she wore were insolently elegant; she radiated a superb\nself-satisfaction. When she looked at you through her lorgnette, you\nfelt as if you were on trial for your life. When she ceased looking,\nyou knew you were sentenced to mount the social scaffold. If it\nhadn’t been for Blakely and Dad, I should have died of rage during\nthe first two weeks of our stay in Santa Barbara.",
        "It was a cruel position for me, and it didn’t make it easier that\nbefore we had been there three days the whole hotel was talking\nabout it. Of course, every woman in the hotel who had been snubbed\nby Blakely’s mother instantly took my part, and as there were only\ntwo women who hadn’t been snubbed by her—Mrs. Tudor Carstairs and\nMrs. Sanderson-Spear—I was simply overwhelmed with unsolicited\nadvice and undesirable attention. Indeed, it was all I could do to\nsteer a dignified course between that uncompromising Scylla,\nBlakely’s mother, and the compromising Charybdis of my self-elected\nchampions. But I managed it, somehow. Dad bought me a stunning big\nautomobile in Los Angeles, and Blakely taught me how to run it;\nthen, Blakely was awfully fond of golf; and we spent loads of time\nat the Country Club. And of course there was the palace on the hill\nto be inspected every little while.",
        "Poor Blakely! How he did hate it all! Again and again he begged Dad\nto give his consent to our marrying at once. But Dad, as unconscious\nof what was going on round him as a two-months-old baby, would\nalways insist that everything would come out all right.",
        "“Give her time, my boy,” he would say, “give her time. Your mother\nisn’t used to our Western way of rushing things, and she wants a\nlittle time to get used to it.”",
        "“What if she never gets used to it?” Blakely would ask.",
        "Then Dad would answer: “You’re impatient, boy; all lovers are\nimpatient. Don’t I know?”",
        "“But things can’t go on this way forever.”",
        "“Of course they can’t,” Dad would agree. “When I think things have\ngone long enough, I’ll have a little talk with your mother myself.\nShe’s a dashed fine-looking woman, your mother—a dashed fine-\nlooking woman! Be patient with her, boy.”",
        "Poor Dad! Blakely and I were resolved that he should never have that\nlittle talk he spoke of with so much confidence. Ideals are awfully\nin the way sometimes, but nobody with a speck of decency can bear to\nstand by and see them destroyed. Dad’s deals had to be preserved at\nany price.",
        "And so another two weeks passed. Then, one day, a comet of amazing\nbrilliancy shot suddenly into our social orbit, and things happened.\nThat this interesting stellar phenomenon was a Russian grand duke, a\nnephew of the Czar, but added to the piquancy of the situation.",
        "The hotel was all in a flutter; the manager was beside himself with\njoy; bell-boys danced jig steps in the corridors; chambermaids went\nabout with a distracted air—and all because the grand duke,\nAlexander Melovich, was to arrive on the morrow. It was an epoch-\nmaking event. It was better than a circus, for it was free. Copies\nof the Almanach de Gotha appeared, as if by magic. Everybody was\ninterested. Everybody was charmed, until—",
        "The rumor flew rapidly along the verandas. It was denied by the head\nwaiter, it was confirmed by the chief clerk; it was referred to the\nmanager himself and again confirmed. Alas, it was true! The Grand\nDuke Alexander was coming, not to honor the hotel, but to honor Mrs.\nCarmichael Porter; she would receive him as her guest, she would pay\nthe royal hotel bill, she would pay the bills of the royal suite.\nYes, Blakely’s mother had captured the grand duke.",
        "A wave of indignation swept the columns of the rank and file. They\ndidn’t want the grand duke themselves, but they didn’t want\nBlakely’s mother to have him; Blakely’s mother and Mrs. Sanderson-\nSpear, and Mrs. Tudor Carstairs. In a way, it was better than a\ncomic opera; it was fearfully amusing.",
        "The grand duke, accompanied, according to the newspapers, “by the\nRoyal Suite and the Choicest Flower of San Francisco Society,\"\narrived on a special train direct from Del Monte. Having captured a\ngrand duke, these “Choicest Flowers” (ten in number) were loath to\nlose him, so they accompanied him. They did more; they paid for the\nspecial train. Blakely’s mother greeted them, one and all, in a most\nfriendly manner. There was an aristocratic air about the whole\nproceeding that was distinctly uplifting.",
        "And now began a round of gaieties, the first being a tea were real\nRussian samovars were in evidence, and sandwiches of real Russian\ncaviar were served. Real Russian cigarettes were smoked, real\nRussian vodka was sipped; the Czar’s health was drunk; no bombs were\nthrown, no bonds were offered for sale, the Russian loan was not\ndiscussed; the Japanese servants were not present, having been given\na half holiday. Oh, it was a little triumph, that tea! Blakely’s\nmother was showered with congratulations. The “Choicest Flowers\"\nvied with one another in assurances of their distinguished approval.",
        "Indeed, they were all crazy about it—except the grand duke. Blakely\nsaid the grand duke was bored to death, and that he had led him off\nto the bar and given him a whisky-and-soda out of sheer pity. From\nthat time on the duke stuck to him like a postage stamp, so that\nBlakely had an awful time escaping that night to dine with Dad and\nme. He told us all about the tea at dinner, and I was surprised to\nlearn (I hadn’t seen him yet) that the duke was just Blakely’s age,\nand, as Blakely put it, “a very decent sort.” Not that there is any\nreason why a grand duke shouldn’t be a decent sort, but Rumor was\nbusy just then proclaiming that this particular grand duke was a\nperfect pig.",
        "The next day I had a chance to judge for myself. It seems the duke\nnoticed me as I got into my automobile for my morning ride, and\nafter finding out who I was, sent for Blakely and demanded that I be\npresented to him.",
        "Blakely was awfully angry. He said: “Look here, I don’t know what\nyou’ve been used to, but in this country, where a man wishes to meet\na young lady, he asks to be presented to her. Not only that, but he\ndoesn’t take it for granted that she’ll be honored by the request.\nMiss Middleton is my fiancee. I don’t know whether she cares to meet\nyou or not. If she does, I’ll let you know.” The duke was terribly\nmortified. He apologized beautifully.",
        "Then Blakely apologized for getting angry, and they became better\nfriends than ever, with the result that the duke was presented to me\nthat very afternoon.",
        "The Grand Duke Alexander was short and fat and fair, with a yellow\nmustache of the Kaiser Wilhelm variety. It was rather a shock to me,\nfor I had expected a dashing black-haired person with flashing eyes\nand a commanding presence. No, he wasn’t at all my idea of what a\ngrand duke should look like; he looked much more like a little\nbrother to the ox (a well-bred, well-dressed, bath-loving little\nbrother, of course) than a member of an imperial family. Not that he\ndidn’t have his points: he had nice hands and nice feet, and his\nsmile was charming.",
        "You should have seen his face light up when he found I spoke French.\nThe poor fellow wasn’t a bit at home in the English language and the\neagerness with which he plunged into French was really pathetic.\nLuckily, Blakely spoke French, too—not very well, but he understood\nit lots better than he spoke it—so we three spent a pleasant hour\ntogether on the veranda. Of course, in a way, it was a little\ntriumph for me; the women whom Blakely’s mother had snubbed enjoyed\nthe sight immensely, and when she appeared, accompanied by Mrs.\nSanderson-Spear and some of the “Choicest Flowers,” and saw what was\nhappening to her duke, she was too angry for words. Heavens, how\nthat woman did hate me that afternoon!",
        "The next morning six more “Choicest Flowers” arrived from San\nFrancisco (rare orchids whose grandfathers had come over from\nIreland in the steerage). The third son of an English baronet who\nowned a chicken-ranch near Los Angeles and a German count who sold\nRhine wines to the best families also appeared; for that night\nBlakely’s mother was to give such a dinner as had never before been\ngiven in Santa Barbara.",
        "Under the heading:",
        "SANTA BARBARA NOW THE MOST COSMOPOLITAN CITY IN AMERICA",
        "an enterprising Los Angeles newspaper devoted a whole page to the\ncoming event. Adjective was piled on adjective, split infinitive on\nsplit infinitive. The dinner was to be given in the ballroom of the\nhotel.... The bank accounts of the assembled guests would total\n$4oo,ooo,ooo.... The terrapin had been specially imported from\nBaltimore.... The decorations were to be magnificent beyond the\nwildest dream.... The duke was to sit on the right of his\nhostess.... Mr. Sanderson-Spear, the Pierpont Morgan of\nPennsylvania, who would arrive that morning from Pittsburg in his\nprivate car, would sit on her left.... Count Boris Beljaski,\nintimate friend and traveling companion of the grand duke, would\nappear in the uniform of the imperial guard.... The Baroness\nReinstadt was hurrying from San Diego, in her automobile.... As a\nwinter resort, Santa Barbara was, as usual, eclipsing Florida,\netc.,... Blakely and I read the paper together; we laughed over it\ntill we cried.",
        "“It would be lots funnier if it wasn’t my mother who was making such\na holy show of herself,” Blakely said. “Do you know, my dear—”",
        "He was silent for a moment. When he did speak, there was a wicked\ngleam in his eyes. “By Jove,” he cried, “I’ll do it!”",
        "“Do what?” I asked.",
        "“Oh, nothing much. I’ll tell you all about it later—if there’s\nanything to tell. Now I must run away. Good-by, dear.”",
        "At a quarter to four I received a note from Blakely saying it would\nbe impossible for him to come in to tea as he had planned. It was\nthe first time he had ever broken an engagement with me, and I was a\nwee bit unhappy over it, though I knew, of course, there must be\nsome good reason why he couldn’t come. Still, his absence rather put\nme out of humor with tea, so I sent Valentine for a box of\nchocolates. When she returned I sat down with them and a novel,\nprepared to spend the rest of the afternoon alone.",
        "The novel wasn’t half as silly as some I’ve read—the hero reminded\nme of Blakely—and the chocolates were unusually good; I was having\na much better time than I had expected. Then some one knocked at the\ndoor.",
        "“Bother!” I thought. “It can’t be anybody I wish to see; I’ll not\nlet them in.”",
        "The knock, was repeated. It suddenly occurred to me that maybe\nBlakely had changed his plans and had come for tea after all.",
        "“Come in,” I called.",
        "The door opened slowly, and there, standing on the threshold, was—\nHad I gone quite mad? I rose from my chair and stared unbelievingly-\n-at Blakely’s mother.",
        "“May I come in?” she asked in her even, well-bred voice.",
        "“Why—yes,” I faltered.",
        "Closing the door behind her, she walked over to the fireplace.",
        "“Won’t you sit down?” I asked. “No, I thank you. This is not an\nafternoon call, Miss Middleton, it is—But of course you\nunderstand.”",
        "I didn’t understand at all, and her manner of saying I did made me\nfurious.",
        " “Perhaps I am very stupid,” I said, “but I cannot imagine why you\nare here.”",
        "“Do you know where my son is?”",
        "“I do not.”",
        "“You have no idea?”",
        "“I have no idea where your son is, nor why you are here.”",
        "She eyed me intently. How cold and determined she looked and how\nhandsome she was.",
        "“If I thought you were telling the truth—”",
        "“Mrs. Porter!”",
        "She handed me a letter. “Please read that,” she said.",
        "“I will not read it,” I replied. “I must beg that you leave me.”",
        "“There, there, child, I did not mean to be rude.”",
        "“You are more than rude, you are insolent.”",
        "“I am distracted, child. Please read the letter.”",
        "“Very well,” I said, “I’ll read it.”",
        "This was the letter:",
        "“MY DEAR MOTHER: This will be handed to you at four o’clock. At\nthat hour I shall be in Ventura, accompanied by the Grand Duke\nAlexander, and, as we are making the trip by automobile, it may be\nthat we shall neither of us return in time for your dinner this\nevening.”",
        "“If, however, on reading this you will wire me at Ventura your full\nconsent to my marriage with Miss Middleton, I think I can guarantee\nthat your dinner party will be a success.”",
        "“I shall be in Ventura till half past four. Should I fail to hear\nfrom you by that time, we shall continue our journey toward Los\nAngeles as fast as our six-cylinders will take us.”",
        "“It grieves me more than I can tell you to employ this cavalier\nmethod against you, but my softer appeals have been in vain.”",
        "“While not a party to the plot, the duke, I find is something of a\nphilosopher; I do not look for any resistance on his part. If he\ndoes resist, so much the worse for him.”",
        "“Your affectionate son, BLAKELY PORTER.”",
        "“P. S. Please do not think that Miss Middleton has any knowledge of\nthis plan. She has not.”",
        "“P. S. Remember! We leave Ventura for Los Angeles at 4:50 p.m.\nsharp.”",
        "“Mrs. Porter,” I said when I had finished reading the letter, “I am\ndeeply humiliated that Blakely should have done this.”",
        "“Still, I suppose you would marry him if I gave my consent.”",
        "“I would not,” I replied hotly. “I might marry him without your\nconsent, for I love him dearly; but I would never consider you had\ngiven your consent if it were forced from you by trickery.”",
        "“You wouldn’t?”",
        "“I would not.”",
        "“But if he doesn’t bring the duke back my dinner will be ruined.”",
        "“I will telegraph him myself,” I said.",
        "“Supposing he won’t come?”",
        "“Blakely will come if I ask him to.”",
        "“And you will do this for me?”",
        "“No; I am not doing it for you.”",
        "“Then why—”",
        "“Because I cannot bear to have Blakely act so ungenerously toward\nhis mother.”",
        "“He has but used my own weapons against me,” she remarked\nthoughtfully.",
        "“Your weapons are quite unworthy of him, Mrs. Porter.” “The telegram\nmust be dispatched at once,” she announced, glancing impatiently at\nher watch.",
        "“If you will call the office and ask them to send up a boy with some\nforms, I will think over what I wish to say,” I said.",
        "When the boy arrived I had decided upon my message. It was:",
        "“BLAKELY PORTER, Ventura.”",
        "“If you do not return at once with your captive I shall consider\nthat we have never met.”",
        "“ELIZABETH.”",
        "I wrote it out on a form and handed it to Mrs. Porter. “Will that\ndo?” I asked.",
        "She read it at a glance. “Yes,” she said, “it will do. Here, boy,\nsee that this is rushed.”",
        "“I’m glad it was satisfactory,” I said. “Good afternoon, Mrs.\nPorter.”",
        "“My dear girl . . .”",
        "“Good afternoon, Mrs. Porter.”",
        "Still she did not go. I realized her predicament, and was childish\nenough to enjoy it, for Blakely’s mother could not bear to accept a\nfavor from a social inferior. Had I been a child, she would have\npatted me on the head and presented me with a sugar plum. As matters\nstood she was quite at sea; she wished to do something gracious—she\ndidn’t know how.",
        "To make her position more impossible, who should come stalking into\nthe room but Dad,—dear, unsuspecting Dad. When he saw Mrs. Porter\nhe immediately jumped at a whole row of conclusions.",
        "“Well, well well!” he said. “This is a sight that does me good. I’m\nvery glad indeed to see you, Mrs. Porter. Your son has had an idea\nthat you were opposed to meeting Elizabeth; but I knew he couldn’t\nbe right. And here you are; calling on her? Well, well, well!\nElizabeth, haven’t you any tea to offer Blakely’s mother!”",
        "“Mrs. Porter was just leaving” I managed to say. “She has been here\nsome time.”",
        "Dad beamed on us both.",
        "“I told Blakely, Elizabeth couldn’t marry him until you consented,\"\nhe blundered on, “but now I suppose it is all arranged. These\nchildren of ours are wonderfully impatient. I’m as fond of Blakely\nas if he were my own son, and you’ll feel the same about Elizabeth\nwhen you’ve known her longer.”",
        "“Don’t let Dad keep you, Mrs. Porter,” I said. “I’m sure you have\nmany things to attend to.”",
        "Blakely’s mother who had been standing like one in a dream, now woke\nup.",
        "“Yes,” she said, “I must be going. I called informally on Elizabeth\nto beg you both to come to my dinner to-night.”",
        "“I told her we couldn’t possibly come,” I began. “Nonsense! Of\ncourse we can come,” Dad declared. “It will quite upset Blakely if\nyou don’t come, and I shall be so disappointed.”",
        "“There, there,” said Dad, “you’re not going to disappoint Blakely’s\nmother by refusing.”",
        "“No,” I replied. “If Mrs. Porter really wants us we shall be\ndelighted to come.”",
        "“If either of you fails me it will make me most unhappy” she said,\nand there was a note of sincerity, in her voice that was\nunmistakable.",
        "“Thank you,” I murmured. “We shall not fail you.”",
        "When Blakely returned with the grand duke, he came straight to me.\nWhat he expected was an explanation; what he actually received was\nthe worst scolding of his life. But the poor boy was so apologetic\nand so humble, I finally relented, and kissed him, and told him all\nabout his mother’s call, and its surprising consequences.",
        "“I suppose I should be grateful,” I said, “but the idea of going to\nthe ducal dinner fills me with rage.”",
        "“Let’s be ill, and dine together.”",
        "“I can’t, I’ve given my word. And then there’s Dad; he feels now\nthat all the prophecies he has uttered in regard to your mother have\nat last come true. It’s only my wicked pride that’s talking, dear.\nPlease don’t pay any attention to it.”",
        "And then Blakely said one of the sweetest things he ever said to me.\nOf course, it wasn’t true but it made me so happy. “Dearest,” he\nsaid “everything I should love best to be, you are.”",
        "Before dressing for dinner, Dad came to my room “to talk things\nover,” as he put it. He was so superbly satisfied with himself and\nthe world, I could hardly forbear a smile.",
        "“Naturally, I should be the last person to say ’I told you so’,\nElizabeth, but you see what patience has done. It is always best to\nbe patient, my child.”",
        "“Yes, Dad.” “Blakely’s mother has acted very handsomely toward us,\nconsidering—”",
        "“Very handsomely, CONSIDERING,” I agreed.",
        "“And we must try to meet her half way.” “Yes, Dad.”",
        "“No doubt she had her reasons for behaving as she did.”",
        "“I’m sure of it.”",
        "“You see, my dear, I’ve understood the situation from the very\nfirst.”",
        "“You sweet old simpleton, of course you have! But here it is half\npast seven, and you haven’t begun to dress. Be off with you.”",
        "Although, at first, I had felt it would be all but impossible for me\nto attend Mrs. Porter’s dinner, my talk with Blakely had so raised\nmy spirits that now I was able to face the ordeal with something\nvery like serenity. What did it matter? What did anything matter, so\nlong as Blakely loved me? Then, too, I knew I was looking my very\nbest; my white lace gown was a dream; Valentine had never done my\nhair so becomingly.",
        "When Blakely called at our rooms for Dad and me, I was not at all\nunhappy. And the dear boy was so relieved to see it! I will confess,\nhowever, to one moment of real terror as we approached the drawing\nroom where we were to join our hostess. But her greeting was most\ncordial and reassuring. And when she begged me to stand up with her,\nand help her receive her guests, I almost felt at home, for I knew\nit meant her surrender was unconditional.",
        "After, that, it was like a beautiful dream. Except that some of the\n\"Choicest Flowers” of San Francisco society were fearfully and\nfashionably late, nothing occurred to disturb the social atmosphere.\nAnd when, on entering the dining room, I saw how the guests were\nplaced, I could have hugged Blakely’s mother. For where do you\nsuppose she had put Dad? On her left! Of course the duke, as guest\nof honor, was on her right; and I sat next to the duke, and Blakely\nsat next to me.",
        "By placing us so, Mrs. Porter had supplied the balance of the table\nwith a topic of conversation, always a desirable addition to a\ndinner party; I noted with amusement the lifted eyebrows, the\nexpressions of wonder and resentment on the faces of some of the\nguests. Nor did it seem to add to their pleasure that their hostess\ndevoted herself to Dad, while the duke and Blakely developed a\nspirited, though friendly, rivalry as to which should monopolize\nlittle Mimi.",
        "But the real sensation was to occur when the champagne was poured.\n(I could hardly believe my eyes, of my ears, either). For who should\nrise in his place but Dad! Yes, there he stood, the old darling, a\nbrimming champagne glass in his hand, a beatific expression on his\nface. And this is what he was saying:",
        "“Our hostess has asked me to do something, which is to announce the\nengagement of my daughter and her son. Let us drink to their\nhappiness.”",
        "“Bravo!” cried the Duke. “I give the American three cheers: Rah,\nrah, rah!” “How delightfully boyish the dear Duke is,” observed Mrs.\nSanderson-Spear, beaming at him from across the table.",
        "“So ingenious, I mean so ingenuous,” assented a languid lady from\nSan Francisco. “But we must stand up; toute le monde is standing up,\nmy dear.”",
        "And so it was, standing up to drink our healths, Blakely’s and mine,\nwhile Blakely held my hand under the table.",
        "“Bravo!” cried the Duke. “It ees delightful. I cannot make the\nspeech, mais, mademoiselle, monsieur—I drink your health.” He\ndrained his glass, then flung it, with a magnificent gesture, over\nhis shoulder. “It ees so we drink to royalty,” he said.",
        "Such a noble example naturally had its effect; there followed a\nperfect shower of glasses. Indeed, I think every one at table\nindulged in this pretty piece of extravagance except the third son\nof an English baronet, who was too busy explaining how it was done\nat home: “Purely a British custom, you understand—the wardroom of a\nman-of-war, d’ye see.—They were officers of a Scotch regiment, and\nthey drank it standing on their chairs, with one foot on the table.\nAnd, by gad, I didn’t care for it!\"—No doubt I should have learned\nmore concerning this purely British custom if the Pierpont Morgan of\nPennsylvania hadn’t called on Blakely for a speech, just then. Poor\nBlakely! He didn’t know at all how to make a speech. Thought I must\nsay I was rather glad of it; the most tiresome thing about Americans\nis their eternal speechmaking, I think.",
        "Blakely having faltered his few words of thanks, some one proposed\nthe duke’s health; but that had to wait till new glasses were\nbrought in and filled. Altogether, then, instead of being a solemn,\ndignified affair, such as one might have expected, it was a\ntremendously jolly dinner—a little rowdy, perhaps, but delightfully\nfriendly. If I had entered the dining room as Old Tom Middleton’s\ndaughter, “who actually used to live over a livery stable, my dear,\"\nit was not so I left it; for the nimbus of the sacred name of Porter\nhad already begun to shed its beautiful light on my many graces and\nsocial accomplishments. Indeed, when I retired with my hostess to\nthe drawing room, it was to hold a sort of reception; Mrs. Tudor\nCarstairs vied with Mrs. Sanderson-Spear in assurances of regard,\n\"Choicest Flowers” expressed approval, the German baroness, bless\nher, conferred the distinction of a motherly kiss. And Blakely’s\nmother was so gracious, so kind and considerate, it was hard to\nbelieve we had faced each other, five hours before, with something\nvery like hatred in our eyes.",
        "When Blakely and Dad, and the other men joined us, I was so happy I\ncould have kicked both my slippers to the ceiling. I might have\ndisgraced myself doing it, too, if the third son of the English\nbaronet hadn’t come up just then to felicitate me. He would. have\ndone it charmingly if he hadn’t felt constrained to add that\nAmericans always say “dook” instead of “duke,” that nobody present\nseemed to realize the proper way to address a nephew of the Czar was\nto call him Monseigneur, that the Olympic games in London had been\nconducted admirably, arid that he didn’t believe in marriage,\nanyway.",
        "But the sweetest thing to me of all that wonderful evening was to\nsee the love and gratitude in Blakely’s eyes when he looked at his\nmother; for a man who doesn’t love his mother misses much, and I\nlove Blakely so tenderly, I couldn’t bear to have him miss the last\nthen that makes for contentment and happiness.",
        "When I awoke, late next morning, it was to find myself, if not\nfamous, at least conspicuous; in the Los Angeles newspaper Valentine\nbrought me with my coffee, much space was devoted to the ducal\ndinner.",
        "GRAND DUKE SMASHES CHAMPAGNE GLASSES",
        "Miss Middleton Toasted in Truly Royal Fashion by Distinguished\nNephew of Russia’s Reigning Czar.",
        "Brilliant Dinner Reaches Climax in Shower of Costly Crystal While\nHostess Smiles Approval.",
        " Disgusting as it was, I couldn’t help laughing at the pen-and-ink\nsketch which accompanied it—a sketch of the duke, with crowned\nhead, and breast covered with decorations, smiling fatuously from\nwithin a rakish bordef, of broken champagne glasses.",
        "But there was worse to come. On another page under the heading:",
        "WHIRLWIND WOOING WINS WESTERN GIRL",
        "a distorted Cupid supported pictures of Blakely and me, while\nbeneath our pictures, a most fulsome chronicle of untruths was\npresented. “Mr. Porter first met his fiancee on shipboard . . .\nBeing of that fine old New York stock which never takes ’no’ for an\nanswer, he followed her to Santa Barbara . . . If rumor is to be\ncredited, the Grand Duke Alexander, as well as Cupid, was concerned\nin this singularly up-to-date love affair . . . Mr. Porter’s sister,\nthe Countess de Bienville, is a well-known leader in exclusive\nParisian circles . . . Miss Middleton an only daughter of Thomas\nMiddleton, the mining magnate . . . Although slightly indisposed,\nHis Imperial Highness granted an interview to our representative\nlate last evening. If the time-worn adage, in vino veritas, is to be\nbelieved; it is certain that the wedding will not only take place\nsoon, but that the favorite nephew of the Czar of all the Russias\nwill himself appear in this charming romance of throbbing hearts,\nplaying the role of best man.”",
        "It was really too dreadful; my cheeks burned with mortification and\nanger.",
        "People had assured me the horrid little American newspaper published\nin Paris was not typical of America—that it was no more than a paid\npanderer to seekers after notoriety. Yet here in California, my own\ndear California, a newspaper had dared print my picture without my\nconsent, had thrown its ugly light on the sweet story of my love\nserving it up in yellow paragraphs for the benefit of the bootblack,\nthe butcher, the waiter in cheap restaurants. What a hideous world!",
        "Pleading a sick headache, I stayed in my room till tea time.",
        "We had tea at five, Blakely and I, on the roof of the hotel. I\nlooked across the channel to the distant islands, followed the sweet\ncontour of the shore, watched the aimless flight of sea-gulls;\nturning, I scanned the friendly hills, the mountains painted in the\ntender colors of late afternoon—I looked into Blakely’s eyes. It\nwas a beautiful world, after all. “Let’s try and forget that awful\nnewspaper,” I said.",
        "“I forgot it long ago, dear.”",
        "“You also seem to have forgotten that some one may appear any\nminute.”",
        "“Let’s try and forget that some one may appear any minute.”",
        "“I can’t.”",
        "“You shouldn’t say ’I can’t,’ Elizabeth; you should say ’I’ll try’.”",
        "It is really surprising what one can do when one tries.",
        "“What would we have done with-out the duke`?” I murmured a moment\nlater.",
        "“There’s a more important question than that to be answered,” said\nBlakely; “we have still to decide what we shall do with the duke.”",
        "“I don’t understand.”",
        "“It’s my charming way of breaking news gently, sweetheart.”",
        "“Bad news?”",
        "“Not exactly. It may annoy you.”",
        "“It annoys me that you seems afraid to tell it,” I said.",
        "“I’m not afraid, not the least bit. I’m, a little ashamed, though.\nYou see mother is . . .”",
        "“Don’t dare adopt an apologizing attitude towards your mother.\nHasn’t she done everything in the world for us?”",
        "“There are some things one would rather do for oneself, girlie. I\nhad quite set my heart on Perry Arnold being best man at our\nwedding.”",
        "“And so he shall be.”",
        "“I wrote him a week ago, and his answer came this morning. He was\ndelighted, poor chap! He’s in Denver, now, and could be here in\nthree days.” “You won’t need him for three months,” I warned. “But\nwhy can’t you have him, dear?”",
        "“Because mother has already engaged the duke in that capacity.”",
        "“Not really?”",
        "“It’s the gospel truth. Perry will think me no end of a snob. I\nwon’t know what explanation to make.”",
        "“Nonsense! I’ll explain it to him myself.”",
        "“Then you feel I ought to accept mother’s arrangements?”",
        "“You must, if it will make her happy.”",
        "“She assured me she would be most miserable if I didn’t.”",
        "“Then it’s settled,” I said.",
        "“That’s not all, Elizabeth; the duke is sailing for Japan on the\ntwenty-sixth of February.”",
        "“And this is the twentieth!” I gasped.",
        "“Yes, sweetheart. And mother has arranged our wedding for the\ntwenty-fourth.”",
        "I was silent from sheer indignation.",
        "“I told mother you wouldn’t like it. But will you . . .? Do you . . .?\nWould you mind very much being married on the twenty-fourth?”",
        "“Would you mind?” I asked.",
        "“Mind? I should love it above everything! Life is so uncertain, each\nday is so precious, and I’ve waited so long for you, Elizabeth.”",
        "“You’ve only known me a little over a month.”",
        "“But I’ve waited years for you;”",
        "“Yes,” I said, “I believe you have: It shall be as you wish, dear.”",
        "And then, as a woman’s greatest happiness lies in making the man she\nloves happy, and as no one ever looked so radiantly happy as\nBlakely, I was so glad I had said “yes,” I didn’t know what to do.",
        "But Blakely knew exactly what to do; he kissed me.",
