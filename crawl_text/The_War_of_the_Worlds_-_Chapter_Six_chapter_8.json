        "It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able\nto slay men so swiftly and so silently.  Many think that in\nsome way they are able to generate an intense heat in a\nchamber of practically absolute non-conductivity.  This intense\nheat they project in a parallel beam against any object they\nchoose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown\ncomposition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse\nprojects a beam of light.  But no one has absolutely proved\nthese details.  However it is done, it is certain that a beam of\nheat is the essence of the matter.  Heat, and invisible, instead\nof visible, light.  Whatever is combustible flashes into flame\nat its touch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and\nmelts glass, and when it falls upon water, incontinently that\nexplodes into steam.",
        "That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about\nthe pit, charred and distorted beyond recognition, and all\nnight long the common from Horsell to Maybury was deserted\nand brightly ablaze.",
        "The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham,\nWoking, and Ottershaw about the same time.  In Woking the\nshops had closed when the tragedy happened, and a number\nof people, shop people and so forth, attracted by the stories\nthey had heard, were walking over the Horsell Bridge and\nalong the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon\nthe common.  You may imagine the young people brushed up\nafter the labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they\nwould make any novelty, the excuse for walking together and\nenjoying a trivial flirtation.  You may figure to yourself the\nhum of voices along the road in the gloaming. . . .",
        "As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that\nthe cylinder had opened, though poor Henderson had sent a\nmessenger on a bicycle to the post office with a special wire\nto an evening paper.",
        "As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open,\nthey found little knots of people talking excitedly and peering\nat the spinning mirror over the sand pits, and the new-comers\nwere, no doubt, soon infected by the excitement of the oc-\ncasion.",
        "By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed,\nthere may have been a crowd of three hundred people or\nmore at this place, besides those who had left the road to\napproach the Martians nearer.  There were three policemen\ntoo, one of whom was mounted, doing their best, under\ninstructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter\nthem from approaching the cylinder.  There was some booing\nfrom those more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a\ncrowd is always an occasion for noise and horse-play.",
        "Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a\ncollision, had telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as\nsoon as the Martians emerged, for the help of a company of\nsoldiers to protect these strange creatures from violence.\nAfter that they returned to lead that ill-fated advance.  The\ndescription of their death, as it was seen by the crowd, tallies\nvery closely with my own impressions: the three puffs of\ngreen smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of\nflame.",
        "But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than\nmine.  Only the fact that a hummock of heathery sand inter-\ncepted the lower part of the Heat-Ray saved them.  Had the\nelevation of the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher,\nnone could have lived to tell the tale.  They saw the flashes\nand the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the\nbushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight.  Then,\nwith a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit,\nthe beam swung close over their heads, lighting the tops of\nthe beech trees that line the road, and splitting the bricks,\nsmashing the windows, firing the window frames, and bring-\ning down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of the\nhouse nearest the corner.",
        "In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees,\nthe panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly\nfor some moments.  Sparks and burning twigs began to fall\ninto the road, and single leaves like puffs of flame.  Hats and\ndresses caught fire.  Then came a crying from the common.\nThere were shrieks and shouts, and suddenly a mounted\npoliceman came galloping through the confusion with his\nhands clasped over his head, screaming.",
        "“They’re coming!” a woman shrieked, and incontinently\neveryone was turning and pushing at those behind, in order\nto clear their way to Woking again.  They must have bolted\nas blindly as a flock of sheep.  Where the road grows narrow\nand black between the high banks the crowd jammed, and a\ndesperate struggle occurred.  All that crowd did not escape;\nthree persons at least, two women and a little boy, were\ncrushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror\nand the darkness.",
