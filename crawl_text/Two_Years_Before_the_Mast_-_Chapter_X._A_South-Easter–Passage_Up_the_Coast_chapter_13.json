        "This night, after sundown, it looked black at the southward and\neastward, and we were told to keep a bright look-out.  Expecting\nto be called up, we turned in early.  Waking up about midnight,\nI found a man who had just come down from his watch, striking a light.\nHe said that it was beginning to puff up from the south-east, and that\nthe sea was rolling in, and he had called the captain; and as he threw\nhimself down on his chest with all his clothes on, I knew that he\nexpected to be called.  I felt the vessel pitching at her anchor,\nand the chain surging and snapping, and lay awake, expecting an\ninstant summons.  In a few minutes it came–three knocks on the\nscuttle, and “All hands ahoy! bear-a-hand up and make sail.\"\nWe sprang up for our clothes, and were about halfway dressed,\nwhen the mate called out, down the scuttle, “Tumble up here, men!\ntumble up! before she drags her anchor.”  We were on deck in an instant.\n“Lay aloft and loose the topsails!” shouted the captain, as soon as\nthe first man showed himself.  Springing into the rigging, I saw that\nthe Ayacucho’s topsails were loosed, and heard her crew singing-out\nat the sheets as they were hauling them home.  This had probably\nstarted our captain; as “old Wilson” (the captain of the Ayacucho)\nhad been many years on the coast, and knew the signs of the weather.\nWe soon had the topsails loosed; and one hand remaining, as usual,\nin each top, to overhaul the rigging and light the sail out, the rest\nof us laid down to man the sheets.  While sheeting home, we saw the\nAyacucho standing athwart our bows, sharp upon the wind, cutting through\nthe head sea like a knife, with her raking masts and sharp bows running\nup like the head of a greyhound.  It was a beautiful sight.  She was\nlike a bird which had been frightened and had spread her wings in flight.\nAfter the topsails had been sheeted home, the head yards braced aback,\nthe fore-top-mast staysail hoisted, and the buoys streamed, and all\nready forward, for slipping, we went aft and manned the slip-rope\nwhich came through the stern port with a turn round the timber-heads.\n“All ready forward?” asked the captain.  “Aye, aye, sir; all ready,\"\nanswered the mate.  “Let go!”  “All gone, sir;” and the iron cable\ngrated over the windlass and through the hawse-hole, and the little\nvessel’s head swinging off from the wind under the force of her backed\nhead sails, brought the strain upon the slip-rope.  “Let go aft!” \nInstantly all was gone, and we were under weigh.  As soon as she was\nwell off from the wind, we filled away the head yards, braced all\nup sharp, set the foresail and trysail, and left our anchorage well\nastern, giving the point a good berth.  “Nye’s off too,” said the\ncaptain to the mate; and looking astern, we could just see the\nlittle hermaphrodite brig under sail standing after us.",
        "It now began to blow fresh; the rain fell fast, and it grew very\nblack; but the captain would not take in sail until we were well\nclear of the point.  As soon as we left this on our quarter, and were\nstanding out to sea, the order was given, and we sprang aloft,\ndouble reefed each topsail, furled the foresail, and double reefed\nthe trysail, and were soon under easy sail.  In those cases of\nslipping for south-easters, there is nothing to be done, after you\nhave got clear of the coast, but to lie-to under easy sail, and wait\nfor the gale to be over, which seldom lasts more than two days,\nand is often over in twelve hours; but the wind never comes back\nto the southward until there has been a good deal of rain fallen.\n“Go below the watch,” said the mate; but here was a dispute which\nwatch it should be, which the mate soon however settled by sending\nhis watch below, saying that we should have our turn the next time\nwe got under weigh.  We remained on deck till the expiration of\nthe watch, the wind blowing very fresh and the rain coming down in\ntorrents.  When the watch came up, we wore ship, and stood on the\nother tack, in towards land.  When we came up again, which was at\nfour in the morning, it was very dark, and there was not much wind,\nbut it was raining as I thought I had never seen it rain before.\nWe had on oil-cloth suits and south-wester caps, and had nothing to\ndo but to stand bolt upright and let it pour down upon us.  There are\nno umbrellas, and no sheds to go under, at sea.",
        "While we were standing about on deck, we saw the little brig\ndrifting by us, hove to under her fore topsail double reefed;\nand she glided by like a phantom.  Not a word was spoken, and we\nsaw no one on deck but the man at the wheel.  Toward morning the\ncaptain put his head out of the companion-way and told the second\nmate, who commanded our watch, to look out for a change of wind,\nwhich usually followed a calm and heavy rain; and it was well\nthat he did; for in a few minutes it fell dead calm, the vessel\nlost her steerage-way, and the rain ceased.  We hauled up the\ntrysail and courses, squared the after yards, and waited for the\nchange, which came in a few minutes, with a vengeance, from the\nnorth-west, the opposite point of the compass.  Owing to our\nprecautions, we were not taken aback, but ran before the wind\nwith square yards.  The captain coming on deck, we braced up a\nlittle and stood back for our anchorage.  With the change of wind\ncame a change of weather, and in two hours the wind moderated into\nthe light steady breeze, which blows down the coast the greater\npart of the year, and, from its regularity, might be called a\ntrade-wind.  The sun came up bright, and we set royals, skysails,\nand studding-sails, and were under fair way for Santa Barbara.\nThe little Loriotte was astern of us, nearly out of sight; but we\nsaw nothing of the Ayacucho.  In a short time she appeared,\nstanding out from Santa Rosa Island, under the lee of which she\nhad been hove to, all night.  Our captain was anxious to get in\nbefore her, for it would be a great credit to us, on the coast,\nto beat the Ayacucho, which had been called the best sailer in\nthe North Pacific, in which she had been known as a trader for\nsix years or more.  We had an advantage over her in light winds,\nfrom our royals and skysails which we carried both at the fore\nand main, and also in our studding-sails; for Captain Wilson\ncarried nothing above top-gallant-sails, and always unbent his\nstudding-sails when on the coast.  As the wind was light and fair,\nwe held our own, for some time, when we were both obliged to brace\nup and come upon a taught bowline, after rounding the point; and here\nhe had us on fair ground, and walked away from us, as you would haul\nin a line.  He afterwards said that we sailed well enough with the\nwind free, but that give him a taught bowline, and he would beat us,\nif we had all the canvas of the Royal George.",
        "The Ayacucho got to the anchoring ground about half an hour before us,\nand was furling her sails when we came up to it.  This picking up your\ncables is a very nice piece of work.  It requires some seamanship to\ndo it, and come to at your former moorings, without letting go another\nanchor.  Captain Wilson was remarkable, among the sailors on the coast,\nfor his skill in doing this; and our captain never let go a second\nanchor during all the time that I was with him.  Coming a little to\nwindward of our buoy, we clewed up the light sails, backed our main\ntopsail, and lowered a boat, which pulled off, and made fast a spare\nhawser to the buoy on the end of the slip-rope.  We brought the other\nend to the captain, and hove in upon it until we came to the slip-rope,\nwhich we took to the windlass, and walked her up to her chain, the captain\nhelping her by backing and filling the sails.  The chain is then passed\nthrough the hawse-hole and round the windlass, and bitted, the slip-rope\ntaken round outside and brought into the stern port, and she is safe\nin her old berth.  After we had got through, the mate told us that\nthis was a small touch of California, the like of which we must\nexpect to have through the winter.",
        "After we had furled the sails and got dinner, we saw the Loriotte\nnearing, and she had her anchor before night.  At sun-down we went\nashore again, and found the Loriotte’s boat waiting on the beach.\nThe Sandwich Islander who could speak English, told us that he had\nbeen up to the town; that our agent, Mr. R––-, and some other\npassengers, were going to Monterey with us, and that we were to\nsail the same night.  In a few minutes Captain T––-, with two\ngentlemen and one female, came down, and we got ready to go off.\nThey had a good deal of baggage, which we put into the bows of\nthe boat, and then two of us took the señora in our arms, and waded\nwith her through the water, and put her down safely in the stern.\nShe appeared much amused with the transaction, and her husband was\nperfectly satisfied, thinking any arrangement good which saved his\nwetting his feet.  I pulled the after oar, so that I heard the\nconversation, and learned that one of the men, who, as well as I\ncould see in the darkness, was a young-looking man, in the European\ndress, and covered up in a large cloak, was the agent of the firm\nto which our vessel belonged; and the other, who was dressed in the\nSpanish dress of the country, was a brother of our captain, who had\nbeen many years a trader on the coast, and had married the lady who\nwas in the boat.  She was a delicate, dark-complexioned young woman,\nand of one of the best families in California.  I also found that\nwe were to sail the same night.  As soon as we got on board,\nthe boats were hoisted up, the sails loosed, the windlass manned,\nthe slip-ropes and gear cast off; and after about twenty minutes\nof heaving at the windlass, making sail, and bracing yards, we were\nwell under weigh, and going with a fair wind up the coast to Monterey.\nThe Loriotte got under weigh at the same time, and was also bound up\nto Monterey, but as she took a different course from us, keeping the\nland aboard, while we kept well out to sea, we soon lost sight of her.\nWe had a fair wind, which is something unusual when going up, as the\nprevailing wind is the north, which blows directly down the coast;\nwhence the northern are called the windward, and the southern the\nleeward ports.",
