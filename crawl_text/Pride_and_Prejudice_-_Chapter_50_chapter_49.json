        "Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life\nthat, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an\nannual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his\nwife, if she survived him.  He now wished it more than ever.\nHad he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been\nindebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could\nnow be purchased for her.  The satisfaction of prevailing on\none of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her\nhusband might then have rested in its proper place.",
        "He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage\nto anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his\nbrother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out\nthe extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation\nas soon as he could.",
        "When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be\nperfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.  The\nson was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should\nbe of age, and the widow and younger children would by that\nmeans be provided for.  Five daughters successively entered the\nworld, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many\nyears after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he would.  This\nevent had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to\nbe saving.  Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\nhusband’s love of independence had alone prevented their\nexceeding their income.",
        "Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\nBennet and the children.  But in what proportions it should be\ndivided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\nThis was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was\nnow to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in\nacceding to the proposal before him.  In terms of grateful\nacknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil\nthe engagements that had been made for him.  He had never before\nsupposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his\ndaughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to\nhimself as by the present arrangement.  He would scarcely be\nten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid\nthem; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the\ncontinual presents in money which passed to her through her\nmother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within\nthat sum.",
        "That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,\ntoo, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present\nwas to have as little trouble in the business as possible.  When\nthe first transports of rage which had produced his activity in\nseeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former\nindolence.  His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory\nin undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.  He\nbegged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to\nhis brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message\nto her.",
        "The good news spread quickly through the house, and with\nproportionate speed through the neighbourhood.  It was borne\nin the latter with decent philosophy.  To be sure, it would\nhave been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia\nBennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative,\nbeen secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse.\nBut there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the\ngood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded\nbefore from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a\nlittle of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because\nwith such an husband her misery was considered certain.",
        "It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on\nthis happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,\nand in spirits oppressively high.  No sentiment of shame gave\na damp to her triumph.  The marriage of a daughter, which had\nbeen the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was\nnow on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her\nwords ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine\nmuslins, new carriages, and servants.  She was busily searching\nthrough the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her\ndaughter, and, without knowing or considering what their\nincome might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\nimportance.",
        "“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it–or\nthe great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;  but\nAshworth is too far off!  I could not bear to have her ten miles\nfrom me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”",
        "Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while\nthe servants remained.  But when they had withdrawn, he said\nto her: “Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses\nfor your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.\nInto one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have\nadmittance.  I will not encourage the impudence of either,\nby receiving them at Longbourn.”",
        "A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was\nfirm.  It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\namazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a\nguinea to buy clothes for his daughter.  He protested that she\nshould receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the\noccasion.  Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it.  That his\nanger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which\nher marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could\nbelieve possible.  She was more alive to the disgrace which her\nwant of new clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than\nto any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a\nfortnight before they took place.",
        "Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the\ndistress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted\nwith their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would\nso shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they\nmight hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those\nwho were not immediately on the spot.",
        "She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.\nThere were few people on whose secrecy she would have more\nconfidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one\nwhose knowledge of a sister’s frailty would have mortified her\nso much–not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it\nindividually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf\nimpassable between them.  Had Lydia’s marriage been concluded\non the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\nMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every\nother objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship\nof the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.",
        "From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.\nThe wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself\nof his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation\nsurvive such a blow as this.  She was humbled, she was grieved;\nshe repented, though she hardly knew of what.  She became jealous\nof his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.\nShe wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of\ngaining intelligence.  She was convinced that she could have been\nhappy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.",
        "What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know\nthat the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four\nmonths ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully\nreceived!  He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most\ngenerous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a\ntriumph.",
        "She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man\nwho, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.  His\nunderstanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have\nanswered all her wishes.  It was an union that must have been\nto the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind\nmight have been softened, his manners improved; and from his\njudgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\nhave received benefit of greater importance.",
        "But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring\nmultitude what connubial felicity really was.  An union of a\ndifferent tendency, and precluding the possibility of the\nother, was soon to be formed in their family.",
        "How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\nindependence, she could not imagine.  But how little of\npermanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only\nbrought together because their passions were stronger than\ntheir virtue, she could easily conjecture.",
        "                          * * * * *",
        "Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.  To Mr. Bennet’s\nacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his\neagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and\nconcluded with entreaties that the subject might never be\nmentioned to him again.  The principal purport of his letter was\nto inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the\nmilitia.",
        "“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as\nsoon as his marriage was fixed on.  And I think you will agree\nwith me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly\nadvisable, both on his account and my niece’s.  It is Mr. Wickham’s\nintention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends,\nthere are still some who are able and willing to assist him in\nthe army.  He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ––’s\nregiment, now quartered in the North.  It is an advantage to have\nit so far from this part of the kingdom.  He promises fairly; and\nI hope among different people, where they may each have a character\nto preserve, they will both be more prudent.  I have written to\nColonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to\nrequest that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\nin and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which\nI have pledged myself.  And will you give yourself the trouble of\ncarrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom\nI shall subjoin a list according to his information?  He has\ngiven in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.\nHaggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.\nThey will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to\nLongbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is\nvery desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South.  She\nis well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and your\nmother.–Yours, etc.,",
        "“E. Gardiner.”",
        "Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s\nremoval from the ––shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.\nBut Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it.  Lydia’s being\nsettled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and\npride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan\nof their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment;\nand, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from\na regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so\nmany favourites.",
        "“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite\nshocking to send her away!  And there are several of the young\nmen, too, that she likes very much.  The officers may not be so\npleasant in General––’s regiment.”",
        "His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being\nadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\nreceived at first an absolute negative.  But Jane and Elizabeth,\nwho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and\nconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her\nparents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly,\nto receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they\nwere married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought,\nand act as they wished.  And their mother had the satisfaction\nof knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter\nin the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North.  When\nMr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his\npermission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon\nas the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.\nElizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent\nto such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination,\nany meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.",
