        "  While Hsi Jen is busy embroidering mandarin ducks, Pao-yü receives, in\n      the Chiang Yün Pavilion, an omen from a dream.\n  Pao-yü apprehends that there is a destiny in affections, when his\n      feelings are aroused to a sense of the situation in the Pear\n      Fragrance court.",
        "Ever since dowager lady Chia’s return from Madame Wang’s quarters, for\nwe will now take up the string of our narrative, she naturally felt\nhappier in her mind as she saw that Pao-yü improved from day to day; but\nnervous lest Chia Cheng should again in the future send for him, she\nlost no time in bidding a servant summon a head-page, a constant\nattendant upon Chia Cheng, to come to her, and in impressing upon him\nvarious orders. “Should,” she enjoined him, “anything turn up\nhenceforward connected with meeting guests, entertaining visitors and\nother such matters, and your master mean to send for Pao-yü, you can\ndispense with going to deliver the message. Just you tell him that I say\nthat after the severe thrashing he has had, great care must be first\ntaken of him during several months before he can be allowed to walk; and\nthat, secondly, his constellation is unpropitious and that he could not\nsee any outsider, while sacrifices are being offered to the stars; that\nI won’t have him therefore put his foot beyond the second gate before\nthe expiry of the eighth moon.”",
        "The head-page listened patiently to her instructions, and, assenting to\nall she had to say, he took his leave.",
        "Old lady Chia thereupon also sent for nurse Li, Hsi Jen and the other\nwaiting-maids and recommended them to tell Pao-yü about her injunctions\nso that he might be able to quiet his mind.",
        "Pao-yü had always had a repugnance for entertaining high officials and\nmen in general, and the greatest horror of going in official hat and\nceremonial dress, to offer congratulations, or express condolences, to\npay calls, return visits, or perform other similar conventionalities,\nbut upon receipt on the present occasion of this message, he became so\nmuch the more confirmed in his dislikes that not only did he suspend all\nintercourse with every single relative and friend, but even went so far\nas to study more than he had ever done before, his own caprices in the\nfulfilment of those morning and evening salutations due to the senior\nmembers of his family. Day after day he spent in the garden, doing\nnothing else than loafing about, sitting down here, or reclining there.\nOf a morning, he would, as soon as it was day, stroll as far as the\nquarters of dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang, to repair back, however,\nin no time. Yet ever ready was he every day that went by to perform\nmenial services for any of the waiting-maids. He, in fact, wasted away\nin the most complete dolce far niente days as well as months. If\nperchance Pao-ch’ai or any other girl of the same age as herself found\nat any time an opportunity to give him advice, he would, instead of\ntaking it in good part, fly into a huff. “A pure and spotless maiden,\"\nhe would say, “has likewise gone and deliberately imitated those\npersons, whose aim is to fish for reputation and to seek praise; that\nset of government thieves and salaried devils. This result entirely\narises from the fact that there have been people in former times, who\nhave uselessly stirred up trouble and purposely fabricated stories with\nthe primary object of enticing the filthy male creatures, who would\nspring up in future ages, to follow in their steps! And who would have\nthought it, I have had the misfortune of being born a masculine being!\nBut, even those beautiful girls, in the female apartments, have been so\ncontaminated by this practice that verily they show themselves\nungrateful for the virtue of Heaven and Earth, in endowing them with\nperception, and in rearing them with so much comeliness.”",
        "Seeing therefore what an insane mania possessed him, not one of his\ncousins came forward to tender him one proper word of counsel. Lin\nTai-yü was the only one of them, who, from his very infancy, had never\nonce admonished him to strive and make a position and attain fame, so\nthus it was that he entertained for Tai-yü profound consideration. But\nenough of minor details.",
        "We will now turn our attention to lady Feng. Soon after the news of Chin\nCh’uan-erh’s death reached her, she saw that domestics from various\nbranches of the family paid her frequent visits at most unexpected\nhours, and presented her a lot of things, and that they courted her\npresence at most unseasonable moments, to pay their compliments and\nadulate her, and she begun to harbour suspicions, in her own mind, as\nshe little knew what their object could possibly be. On this date, she\nagain noticed that some of them had brought their gifts, so, when\nevening arrived, and no one was present, she felt compelled to inquire\njocosely of P’ing Erh what their aim could be.",
        "“Can’t your ladyship fathom even this?” P’ing Erh answered with a\nsardonic smile. “Why, their daughters must, I fancy, be servant-girls in\nMadame Wang’s apartments! For her ladyship’s rooms four elderly girls\nare at present allotted with a monthly allowance of one tael; the rest\nsimply receiving several hundreds of cash each month; so now that Chin\nCh’uan-erh is dead and gone, these people must, of course, be anxious to\ntry their tricks and get this one-tael job!”",
        "Hearing this, lady Feng smiled a significant smile. “That’s it. Yes,\nthat’s it!” she exclaimed. “You’ve really suggested the idea to my mind!\nFrom all appearances, these people are a most insatiable lot; for they\nmake quite enough in the way of money! And as for any business that\nrequires a little exertion, why they are never ready to bear a share of\nit! They make use of their girls as so many tools to shove their own\nduties upon. Yet one overlooks that. But must they too have designs upon\nthis job? Never mind! These people cannot easily afford to spend upon me\nthe money they do. But they bring this upon their own selves, so I’ll\nkeep every bit of thing they send. I’ve, after all, resolved how to act\nin the matter!”",
        "Having arrived at this decision, lady Feng purely and simply protracted\nthe delay until all the women had sent her enough to satisfy her, when\nshe at last suited her own convenience and spoke to Madame Wang (on the\nsubject of the vacant post).",
        "Mrs. Hsüeh and her daughter were sitting one day, at noon, in Madame\nWang’s quarters, together with Lin Tai-yü and the other girls, when lady\nFeng found an opportunity and broached the topic with Madame Wang. “Ever\nsince,” she said, “sister Chin Ch’uan-erh’s death, there has been one\nservant less in your ladyship’s service. But you may possibly have set\nyour choice upon some girl; if so, do let me know who it is, so that I\nmay be able to pay her her monthly wages.”",
        "This reminder made Madame Wang commune with her own self. “I fancy,” she\nremarked; “that the custom is that there should be four or five of them;\nbut as long as there are enough to wait upon me, I don’t mind, so we can\nreally dispense with another.”",
        "“What you say is, properly speaking, perfectly correct,” smiled lady\nFeng; “but it’s an old established custom. There are still a couple to\nbe found in other people’s rooms and won’t you, Madame, conform with the\nrule? Besides, the saving of a tael is a small matter.”",
        "After this argument, Madame Wang indulged in further thought. “Never\nmind,” she then observed, “just you bring over this allowance and pay it\nto me. And there will be no need to supply another girl. I’ll hand over\nthis tael to her younger sister, Yü Ch’uan-erh, and finish with it. Her\nelder sister came to an unpleasant end, after a long term of service\nwith me; so if the younger sister, she leaves behind in my employ,\nreceives a double share, it won’t be any too excessive.”",
        "Lady Feng expressed her approval and turning round she said smilingly to\nYü Ch’uan-erh: “I congratulate you, I congratulate you!”",
        "Yü Ch’uan-erh thereupon crossed over and prostrated herself.",
        "“I just want to ask you,” Madame Wang went on to inquire, “how much Mrs.\nChao and Mrs. Chou are allowed monthly?”",
        "“They have a fixed allowance,” answered lady Feng, “each of them draws\ntwo taels. But Mrs. Chao gets two taels for cousin Chia Huan, so hers\namounts in all to four taels; besides these, four strings of cash.”",
        "“Are they paid in full month after month?” Madame Wang inquired.",
        "Lady Feng thought the question so very strange that she hastened to\nexclaim by way of reply: “How are they not paid in full?”",
        "“The other day,” Madame Wang proceeded, “I heard a faint rumour that\nthere was some one, who complained in an aggrieved way that she had got\na string short. How and why is this?”",
        "“The monthly allowances of the servant-girls, attached to the secondary\nwives,” lady Feng hurriedly added with a smile, “amounted originally to\na tiao each, but ever since last year, it was decided, by those people\noutside, that the shares of each of those ladies’ girls should be\nreduced by half, that is, each to five hundred cash; and, as each lady\nhas a couple of servant-girls, they receive therefore a tiao short. But\nfor this, they can’t bear me a grudge. As far as I’m concerned, I would\nonly be too glad to let them have it; but our people outside will again\ndisallow it; so is it likely that I can authorise any increase, pray? In\nthis matter of payments I merely receive the money, and I’ve nothing to\ndo with how it comes and how it goes. I nevertheless recommended, on two\nor three occasions, that it would be better if these two shares were\nagain raised to the old amount; but they said that there’s only that\nmuch money, so that I can’t very well volunteer any further suggestions!\nNow that the funds are paid into my hands, I give them to them every\nmonth, without any irregularity of even so much as a day. When payments\nhitherto were effected outside, what month were they not short of money?\nAnd did they ever, on any single instance, obtain their pay at the\nproper time and date?”",
        "Having heard this explanation, Madame Wang kept silent for a while.\nNext, she proceeded to ask, how many girls there were with dowager lady\nChia drawing one tael.",
        "“Eight of them,” rejoined lady Feng, “but there are at present only\nseven; the other one is Hsi Jen.”",
        "“Quite right,” assented Madame Wang. “But your cousin Pao-yü hasn’t any\nmaid at one tael; for Hsi Jen is still a servant belonging to old lady\nChia’s household.”",
        "“Hsi Jen,” lady Feng smiled, “is still our dear ancestor’s servant;\nshe’s only lent to cousin Pao-yü; so that she still receives this tael\nin her capacity of maid to our worthy senior. Any proposal, therefore,\nthat might now be made, that this tael should, as Hsi Jen is Pao-yü’s\nservant, be curtailed, can, on no account, be entertained. Yet, were it\nsuggested that another servant should be added to our senior’s staff,\nthen in this way one could reduce the tael she gets. But if this be not\ncurtailed, it will be necessary to also add a servant in cousin Chia\nHuan’s rooms, in order that there should be a fair apportionment. In\nfact, Ch’ing Wen, She Yüeh and the others, numbering seven senior maids,\nreceive each a tiao a month; and Chiao Hui and the rest of the junior\nmaids, eight in all, get each five hundred cash per mensem; and this was\nrecommended by our venerable ancestor herself; so how can any one be\nangry and feel displeasure?”",
        "“Just listen,” laughed Mrs. Hsüeh, “to that girl Feng’s mouth! It\nrattles and rattles like a cart laden with walnuts, which has turned\ntopsy-turvy! Yet, her accounts are, from what one can gather, clear\nenough, and her arguments full of reason.”",
        "“Aunt,” rejoined lady Feng smiling, “was I likely, pray, wrong in what I\nsaid?”",
        "“Who ever said you were wrong?” Mrs. Hsüeh smiled. “But were you to talk\na little slower, wouldn’t it be a saving of exertion for you?”",
        "Lady Feng was about to laugh, but hastily checking herself, she lent an\near to what Madame Wang might have to tell her.",
        "Madame Wang indulged in thought for a considerable time. Afterwards,\nfacing lady Feng, “You’d better,” she said, “select a waiting-maid\ntomorrow and send her over to our worthy senior to fill up Hsi Jen’s\nplace. Then, discontinue that allowance, which Hsi Jen draws, and keep\nout of the sum of twenty taels, allotted to me monthly, two taels and a\ntiao, and give them to Hsi Jen. So henceforward what Mrs. Chao and Mrs.\nChou will get, Hsi Jen will likewise get, with the only difference that\nthe share granted to Hsi Jen, will be entirely apportioned out of my own\nallowance. Mind, therefore, there will be no necessity to touch the\npublic funds!”",
        "Lady Feng acquiesced to each one of her recommendations, and, pushing\nMrs. Hsüeh, “Aunt,” she inquired, “have you heard her proposal? What\nhave I all along maintained? Well, my words have actually come out true\nto-day!”",
        "“This should have been accomplished long ago,” Mrs. Hsüeh answered. “For\nwithout, of course, making any allusion to her looks, her way of doing\nbusiness is liberal; her speech and her relations with people are always\nprompted by an even temper, while inwardly she has plenty of singleness\nof heart and eagerness to hold her own. Indeed, such a girl is not easy\nto come across!”",
        "Madame Wang made every effort to conceal her tears. “How could you\npeople ever rightly estimate Hsi Jen’s qualities?” she observed. “Why,\nshe’s a hundred times better than my own Pao-yü. How fortunate, in\nreality, Pao-yü is! Well would it be if he could have her wait upon him\nfor the whole length of his life!”",
        "“In that case,” lady Feng suggested, “why, have her face shaved at once,\nand openly place her in his room as a secondary wife. Won’t this be a\ngood plan?”",
        "“This won’t do!” Madame Wang retorted. “For first and foremost he’s of\ntender years. In the second place, my husband won’t countenance any such\nthing! In the third, so long as Pao-yü sees that Hsi Jen is his\nwaiting-maid, he may, in the event of anything occurring from his having\nbeen allowed to run wild, listen to any good counsel she might give him.\nBut were she now to be made his secondary wife, Hsi Jen would not\nventure to tender him any extreme advice, even when it’s necessary to do\nso. It’s better, therefore, to let things stand as they are for the\npresent, and talk about them again, after the lapse of another two or\nthree years.”",
        "At the close of these arguments, lady Feng could not put in a word, by\nway of reply, to refute them, so turning round, she left the room. She\nhad no sooner, however, got under the verandah, than she discerned the\nwives of a number of butlers, waiting for her to report various matters\nto her. Seeing her issue out of the room, they with one consent smiled.\n“What has your ladyship had to lay before Madame Wang,” they remarked,\n“that you’ve been talking away this length of time? Didn’t you find it\nhot work?”",
        "Lady Feng tucked up her sleeves several times. Then resting her foot on\nthe step of the side door, she laughed and rejoined: “The draft in this\npassage is so cool, that I’ll stop, and let it play on me a bit before I\ngo on. You people,” she proceeded to tell them, “say that I’ve been\ntalking to her all this while, but Madame Wang conjured up all that has\noccurred for the last two hundred years and questioned me about it; so\ncould I very well not have anything to say in reply? But from this day\nforth,” she added with a sarcastic smile, “I shall do several mean\nthings, and should even (Mrs. Chao and Mrs. Chou) go, out of any\nill-will, and tell Madame Wang, I won’t know what fear is for such\nstupid, glib-tongued, foul-mouthed creatures as they, who are bound not\nto see a good end! It isn’t for them to indulge in those fanciful dreams\nof becoming primary wives, for there, will come soon a day when the\nwhole lump sum of their allowance will be cut off! They grumble against\nus for having now reduced the perquisites of the servant-maids, but they\ndon’t consider whether they deserve to have so many as three girls to\ndance attendance on them!”",
        "While heaping abuse on their heads, she started homewards, and went all\nalone in search of some domestic to go and deliver a message to old lady\nChia.",
        "But without any further reference to her, we will take up the thread of\nour narrative with Mrs. Hsüeh, and the others along with her. During\nthis interval they finished feasting on melons. After some more gossip,\neach went her own way; and Pao-ch’ai, Tai-yü and the rest of the cousins\nreturned into the garden. Pao-ch’ai then asked Tai-yü to repair with her\nto the O Hsiang Arbour. But Tai-yü said that she was just going to have\nher bath, so they parted company, and Pao-ch’ai walked back all by\nherself. On her way, she stepped into the I Hung Yüan, to look up Pao-yü\nand have a friendly hobnob with him, with the idea of dispelling her\nmid-day lassitude; but, contrary to her expectations, the moment she put\nher foot into the court, she did not so much as catch the caw of a crow.\nEven the two storks stood under the banana trees, plunged in sleep.\nPao-ch’ai proceeded along the covered passage and entered the rooms.\nHere she discovered the servant-girls sleeping soundly on the bed of the\nouter apartment; some lying one way, some another; so turning round the\ndecorated screen, she wended her steps into Pao-yü’s chamber. Pao-yü was\nasleep in bed. Hsi Jen was seated by his side, busy plying her needle.\nNext to her, lay a yak tail. Pao-ch’ai advanced up to her. “You’re\nreally far too scrupulous,” she said smilingly in an undertone. “Are\nthere still flies or mosquitos in here? and why do yet use that fly-flap\nfor, to drive what away?”",
        "Hsi Jen was quite taken by surprise. But hastily raising her head, and\nrealising that it was Pao-ch’ai, she hurriedly put down her needlework.\n“Miss,” she whispered with a smile, “you came upon me so unawares that\nyou gave me quite a start! You don’t know, Miss, that though there be no\nflies or mosquitoes there is, no one would believe it, a kind of small\ninsect, which penetrates through the holes of this gauze; it is scarcely\nto be detected, but when one is asleep, it bites just like ants do!”",
        "“It isn’t to be wondered at,” Pao-ch’ai suggested, “for the back of\nthese rooms adjoins the water; the whole place is also one mass of\nfragrant flowers, and the interior of this room is, too, full of their\naroma. These insects grow mostly in the core of flowers, so no sooner do\nthey scent the smell of any than they at once rush in.”",
        "Saying this, she cast a look on the needlework she (Hsi Jen) held in her\nhands. It consisted, in fact, of a belt of white silk, lined with red,\nand embroidered on the upper part with designs representing mandarin\nducks, disporting themselves among some lotus. The lotus flowers were\nred, the leaves green, the ducks of variegated colours.",
        "“Ai-yah!” ejaculated Pao-ch’ai, “what very beautiful work! For whom is\nthis, that it’s worth your while wasting so much labour on it?”",
        "Hsi Jen pouted her lips towards the bed.",
        "“Does a big strapping fellow like this,” Pao-ch’ai laughed, “still wear\nsuch things?”",
        "“He would never wear any before,” Hsi Jen smiled, “that’s why such a\nnice one was specially worked for him, in order that when he was allowed\nto see it, he should not be able to do otherwise than use it. With the\npresent hot weather, he goes to sleep anyhow, but as he has been coaxed\nto wear it, it doesn’t matter if even he doesn’t cover himself well at\nnight. You say that I bestow much labour upon this, but you haven’t yet\nseen the one he has on!”",
        "“It is a lucky thing,” Pao-ch’ai observed, smiling, “that you’re gifted\nwith such patience.”",
        "“I’ve done so much of it to-day,” remarked Hsi Jen, “that my neck is\nquite sore from bending over it. My dear Miss,” she then urged with a\nbeaming countenance, “do sit here a little. I’ll go out for a turn. I’ll\nbe back shortly.”",
        "With these words, she sallied out of the room.",
        "Pao-ch’ai was intent upon examining the embroidery, so in her\nabsentmindedness, she, with one bend of her body, settled herself on the\nvery same spot, which Hsi Jen had recently occupied. But she found, on\nsecond scrutiny, the work so really admirable, that impulsively picking\nup the needle, she continued it for her. At quite an unforeseen\nmoment–for Lin Tai-yü had met Shih Hsiang-yün and asked her to come\nalong with her and present her congratulations to Hsi Jen–these two\ngirls made their appearance in the court. Finding the whole place\nplunged in silence, Hsiang-yün turned round and betook herself first\ninto the side-rooms in search of Hsi Jen. Lin Tai-yü, meanwhile, walked\nup to the window from outside, and peeped in through the gauze frame. At\na glance, she espied Pao-yü, clad in a silvery-red coat, lying\ncarelessly on the bed, and Pao-ch’ai, seated by his side, busy at some\nneedlework, with a fly-brush resting by her side.",
        "As soon as Lin Tai-yü became conscious of the situation, she immediately\nslipped out of sight, and stopping her mouth with one hand, as she did\nnot venture to laugh aloud, she waved her other hand and beckoned to\nHsiang-yün. The moment Hsiang-yün saw the way she went on, she concluded\nthat she must have something new to impart to her, and she approached\nher with all promptitude. At the sight, which opened itself before her\neyes, she also felt inclined to laugh. Yet the sudden recollection of\nthe kindness, with which Pao-ch’ai had always dealt towards her, induced\nher to quickly seal her lips. And knowing well enough that Tai-yü never\nspared any one with her mouth, she was seized with such fear lest she\nshould jeer at them, that she immediately dragged her past the window.\n“Come along!” she observed. “Hsi Jen, I remember, said that she would be\ngoing at noon to wash some clothes at the pond. I presume she’s there\nalready so let’s go and join her.”",
        "Tai-yü inwardly grasped her meaning, but, after indulging in a couple of\nsardonic smiles, she had no alternative but to follow in her footsteps.",
        "Pao-ch’ai had, during this while, managed to embroider two or three\npetals, when she heard Pao-yü begin to shout abusingly in his dreams.\n“How can,” he cried, “one ever believe what bonzes and Taoist priests\nsay? What about a match between gold and jade? My impression is that\nit’s to be a union between a shrub and a stone!”",
        "Hsüeh Pao-ch’ai caught every single word uttered by him and fell\nunconsciously in a state of excitement. Of a sudden, however, Hsi Jen\nappeared on the scene. “Hasn’t he yet woke up?” she inquired.",
        "Pao-ch’ai nodded her head by way of reply.",
        "“I just came across,” Hsi Jen smiled, “Miss Lin and Miss Shih. Did they\nhappen to come in?”",
        "“I didn’t see them come in,” Pao-ch’ai answered. “Did they tell you\nanything?” she next smilingly asked of Hsi Jen.",
        "Hsi Jen blushed and laughed significantly. “They simply came out with\nsome of those jokes of theirs,” she explained. “What decent things could\nsuch as they have had to tell me?”",
        "“They made insinuations to-day,” Pao-ch’ai laughed, “which are anything\nbut a joke! I was on the point of telling you them, when you rushed away\nin an awful hurry.”",
        "But no sooner had she concluded, than she perceived a servant, come over\nfrom lady Feng’s part to fetch Hsi Jen. “It must be on account of what\nthey hinted,” Pao-ch’ai smilingly added.",
        "Hsi Jen could not therefore do otherwise than arouse two servant-maids\nand go. She proceeded, with Pao-ch’ai, out of the I Hung court, and then\nrepaired all alone to lady Feng’s on this side. It was indeed to\ncommunicate to her what had been decided about her, and to explain to\nher, as well, that though she could go and prostrate herself before\nMadame Wang, she could dispense with seeing dowager lady Chia. This news\nmade Hsi Jen feel very awkward; to such an extent, that no sooner had\nshe got through her visit to Madame Wang, than she returned in a hurry\nto her rooms.",
        "Pao-yü had already awoke. He asked the reason why she had been called\naway, but Hsi Jen temporised by giving him an evasive answer. And only\nat night, when every one was quiet, did Hsi Jen at length give him a\nfull account of the whole matter. Pao-yü was delighted beyond measure.\n“I’ll see now,” he said, with a face beaming with smiles, “whether\nyou’ll go back home or not. On your return, after your last visit to\nyour people, you stated that your brother wished to redeem you, adding\nthat this place was no home for you, and that you didn’t know what would\nbecome of you in the long run. You freely uttered all that language\ndevoid of feeling and reason, and enough too to produce an estrangement\nbetween us, in order to frighten me; but I’d like to see who’ll\nhenceforward have the audacity to come and ask you to leave!”",
        "Hsi Jen, upon hearing this, smiled a smile full of irony. “You shouldn’t\nsay such things!” she replied. “From henceforward I shall be our Madame\nWang’s servant, so that, if I choose to go I needn’t even breathe a word\nto you. All I’ll have to do will be to tell her, and then I shall be\nfree to do as I like.”",
        "“But supposing that I behaved improperly,” demurred Pao-yü laughingly,\n“and that you took your leave after letting mother know, you yourself\nwill be placed in no nice fix, when people get wind that you left on\naccount of my having been improper.”",
        "“What no nice fix!” smiled Hsi Jen. “Is it likely that I am bound to\nserve even highway robbers? Well, failing anything else, I can die; for\nhuman beings may live a hundred years, but they’re bound, in the long\nrun, to fall a victim to death! And when this breath shall have\ndeparted, and I shall have lost the sense of hearing and of seeing, all\nwill then be well!”",
        "When her rejoinder fell on his ear, Pao-yü promptly stopped her mouth\nwith both his hands. “Enough! enough! that will do,” he shouted.\n“There’s no necessity for you to utter language of this kind.”",
        "Hsi Jen was well aware that Pao-yü was gifted with such a peculiar\ntemperament, that he even looked upon flattering or auspicious phrases\nwith utter aversion, treating them as meaningless and consequently\ninsincere, so when, after listening to those truths, she had spoken with\nsuch pathos, he, lapsed into another of his melancholy moods, she blamed\nherself for the want of consideration she had betrayed. Hastily\ntherefore putting on a smile, she tried to hit upon some suitable\nremarks, with which to interrupt the conversation. Her choice fell upon\nthose licentious and immodest topics, which had ever been a relish to\nthe taste of Pao-yü; and from these the conversation drifted to the\nsubject of womankind. But when, subsequently, reference was made to the\nexcellency of the weak sex, they somehow or other also came to touch\nupon the mortal nature of women, and Hsi Jen promptly closed her lips in\nsilence.",
        "Noticing however that now that the conversation had reached a point so\nfull of zest for him, she had nothing to say for herself, Pao-yü\nsmilingly remarked: “What human being is there that can escape death?\nBut the main thing is to come to a proper end! All that those abject\nmale creatures excel in is, the civil officers, to sacrifice their lives\nby remonstrating with the Emperor; and, the military, to leave their\nbones on the battlefield. Both these deaths do confer, after life is\nextinct, the fame of great men upon them; but isn’t it, in fact, better\nfor them not to die? For as it is absolutely necessary that there should\nbe a disorderly Emperor before they can afford any admonition, to what\nfuture fate do they thus expose their sovereign, if they rashly throw\naway their lives, with the sole aim of reaping a fair name for\nthemselves? War too must supervene before they can fight; but if they go\nand recklessly lay down their lives, with the exclusive idea of gaining\nthe reputation of intrepid warriors, to what destiny will they abandon\ntheir country by and bye? Hence it is that neither of these deaths can\nbe looked upon as a legitimate death.”",
        "“Loyal ministers,” Hsi Jen argued, “and excellent generals simply die\nbecause it isn’t in their power to do otherwise.”",
        "“Military officers,” Pao-yü explained, “place such entire reliance upon\nbrute force that they become lax in their stratagems and faulty in their\nplans. It’s because they don’t possess any inherent abilities that they\nlose their lives. Could one therefore, pray, say that they had no other\nalternative? Civil officials, on the other hand, can still less compare\nwith military officers. They read a few passages from books, and commit\nthem to memory; and, on the slightest mistake made by the Emperor,\nthey’re at once rash enough to remonstrate with him, prompted by the\nsole idea of attaining the fame of loyalty and devotion. But, as soon as\ntheir stupid notions have bubbled over, they forfeit their lives, and is\nit likely that it doesn’t lie within their power to do otherwise? Why,\nthey should also bear in mind that the Emperor receives his decrees from\nHeaven; and, that were he not a perfect man, Heaven itself would, on no\naccount whatever, confer upon him a charge so extremely onerous. This\nmakes it evident therefore that the whole pack and parcel of those\nofficers, who are dead and gone, have invariably fallen victims to their\nendeavours to attain a high reputation, and that they had no knowledge\nwhatever of the import of the great principle of right! Take me as an\ninstance now. Were really mine the good fortune of departing life at a\nfit time, I’d avail myself of the present when all you girls are alive,\nto pass away. And could I get you to shed such profuse tears for me as\nto swell out into a stream large enough to raise my corpse and carry it\nto some secluded place, whither no bird even has ever wended its flight,\nand could I become invisible like the wind, and nevermore from this\ntime, come into existence as a human being, I shall then have died at a\nproper season.”",
        "Hsi Jen suddenly awoke to the fact that he was beginning to give vent to\na lot of twaddle, and speedily, pleading fatigue, she paid no further\nnotice to him. This compelled Pao-yü to at last be quiet and go to\nsleep. By the morrow, all recollection of the discussion had vanished\nfrom his mind.",
        "One day, Pao-yü was feeling weary at heart, after strolling all over the\nplace, when remembering the song of the “Peony Pavilion,” he read it\nover twice to himself; but still his spirits continued anything but\njoyous. Having heard, however, that among the twelve girls in the Pear\nFragrance Court there was one called Ling Kuan, who excelled in singing,\nhe purposely issued forth by a side gate and came in search of her. But\nthe moment he got there, he discovered Pao Kuan, and Yü Kuan in the\ncourt. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yü, they, with one consent,\nsmiled and urged him to take a seat. Pao-yü then inquired where Ling\nKuan was. Both girls explained that she was in her room, so Pao-yü\nhastened in. Here he found Ling Kuan alone, reclining against a pillow.\nThough perfectly conscious of his arrival, she did not move a muscle.\nPao-yü ensconced himself next to her. He had always been in the habit of\nplaying with the rest of the girls, so thinking that Ling Kuan was like\nthe others, he felt impelled to draw near her and to entreat her, with a\nforced smile, to get up and sing part of the “Niao Ch’ing Ssu.” But his\nhopes were baffled; for as soon as Ling Kuan perceived him sit down, she\nimpetuously raised herself and withdrew from his side. “I’m hoarse,” she\nrejoined with a stern expression on her face. “The Empress the other day\ncalled us into the palace; but I couldn’t sing even then.”",
        "Seeing her sit bolt upright, Pao-yü went on to pass her under a minute\nsurvey. He discovered that it was the girl, whom he had, some time ago\nbeheld under the cinnamon roses, drawing the character “Ch’iang.” But\nseeing the reception she accorded him, who had never so far known what\nit was to be treated contemptuously by any one, he blushed crimson,\nwhile muttering some abuse to himself, and felt constrained to quit the\nroom.",
        "Pao Kuan and her companion could not fathom why he was so red and\ninquired of him the reason. Pao-yü told them. “Wait a while,” Pao Kuan\nsaid, “until Mr. Ch’iang Secundus comes; and when he asks her to sing,\nshe is bound to sing.”",
        "Pao-yü at these words felt very sad within himself. “Where’s brother\nCh’iang gone to?” he asked.",
        "“He’s just gone out,” Pao Kuan answered. “Of course, Ling Kuan must have\nwanted something or other, and he’s gone to devise ways and means to\nbring it to her.”",
        "Pao-yü thought this remark very extraordinary. But after standing about\nfor a while, he actually saw Chia Ch’iang arrive from outside, carrying\na cage, with a tiny stage inserted at the top, and a bird as well; and\nwend his steps, in a gleeful mood, towards the interior to join Ling\nKuan. The moment, however, he noticed Pao-yü, he felt under the\nnecessity of halting.",
        "“What kind of bird is that?” Pao-yü asked. “Can it hold a flag in its\nbeak, or do any tricks?”",
        "“It’s the ’jade-crested and gold-headed bird,’” smiled Chia Ch’iang.",
        "“How much did you give for it?” Pao-yü continued.",
        "“A tael and eight mace,” replied Chia Ch’iang.",
        "But while replying to his inquiries, he motioned to Pao-yü to take a\nseat, and then went himself into Ling Kuan’s apartment.",
        "Pao-yü had, by this time, lost every wish of hearing a song. His sole\ndesire was to find what relations existed between his cousin and Ling\nKuan, when he perceived Chia Ch’iang walk in and laughingly say to her,\n“Come and see this thing.”",
        "“What’s it?” Ling Kuan asked, rising.",
        "“I’ve bought a bird for you to amuse yourself with,” Chia Ch’iang added,\n“so that you mayn’t daily feel dull and have nothing to distract\nyourself with. But I’ll first play with it and let you see.”",
        "With this prelude, he took a few seeds and began to coax the bird, until\nit, in point of fact, performed various tricks, on the stage, clasping\nin its beak a mask and a flag.",
        "All the girls shouted out: “How nice;” with the sole exception of Ling\nKuan, who gave a couple of apathetic smirks, and went in a huff to lie\ndown. Again Chia Ch’iang, however, kept on forcing smiles, and inquiring\nof her whether she liked it or not.",
        "“Isn’t it enough,” Ling Kuan observed, “that your family entraps a fine\nlot of human beings like us and coops us up in this hole to study this\nstuff and nonsense, but do you also now go and get a bird, which\nlikewise is, as it happens, up to this sort of thing? You distinctly\nfetch it to make fun of us, and mimick us, and do you still ask me\nwhether I like it or not?”",
        "Hearing this reproach, Chia Ch’iang of a sudden sprang to his feet with\nalacrity and vehemently endeavoured by vowing and swearing to establish\nhis innocence. “How ever could I have been such a fool to-day,” he\nproceeded, “as to go and throw away a tael or two to purchase this bird?\nI really did it in the hope that it would afford you amusement. I never\nfor a moment entertained such thoughts as those you credit me with. But\nnever mind; I’ll let it go, and save you all this misery!”",
        "So saying, he verily gave the bird its liberty; and, with one blow, he\nsmashed the cage to atoms.",
        "“This bird,” still argued Ling Kuan, “differs, it’s true, from a human\nbeing; but it too has a mother and father in its nest, and could you\nhave had the heart to bring it here to perform these silly pranks? In\ncoughing to-day, I expectorated two mouthfuls of blood, and Madame Wang\nsent some one here to find you so as to tell you to ask the doctor round\nto minutely diagnose my complaint, and have you instead brought this to\nmock me with? But it so happens that I, who have not a soul to look\nafter me, or to care for me, also have the fate to fall ill!”",
        "Chia Ch’iang listened to her. “Yesterday evening,” he eagerly explained,\n“I asked the doctor about it. He said that it was nothing at all, that\nyou should take a few doses of medicine, and that he would be coming\nagain in a day or two to see how you were getting on. But who’d have\nthought it, you have again to-day expectorated blood. I’ll go at once\nand invite him to come round.”",
        "Speaking the while, he was about to go immediately when Ling Kuan cried\nout and stopped him. “Do you go off in a tantrum in this hot broiling\nsun?” she said. “You may ask him to come, but I won’t see him.”",
        "When he heard her resolution, Chia Ch’iang had perforce to stand still.",
        "Pao-yü, perceiving what transpired between them, fell unwittingly in a\ndull reverie. He then at length got an insight into the deep import of\nthe tracing of the character “Ch’iang.” But unable to bear the ordeal\nany longer, he forthwith took himself out of the way. So absorbed,\nhowever, was Chia Ch’iang’s whole mind with Ling Kuan that he could not\neven give a thought to escorting any one; and it was, in fact, the rest\nof the singing-girls who saw (Pao-yü) out.",
        "Pao-yü’s heart was gnawed with doubts and conjectures. In an imbecile\nframe of mind, he came to the I Hung court. Lin Tai-yü was, at the\nmoment, sitting with Hsi Jen, and chatting with her. As soon as Pao-yü\nentered his quarters, he addressed himself to Hsi Jen, with a long sigh.\n“I was very wrong in what I said yesterday evening,” he remarked. “It’s\nno matter of surprise that father says that I am so narrow-minded that I\nlook at things through a tube and measure them with a clam-shell. I\nmentioned something last night about having nothing but tears, shed by\nall of you girls, to be buried in. But this was a mere delusion! So as I\ncan’t get the tears of the whole lot of you, each one of you can\nhenceforward keep her own for herself, and have done.”",
        "Hsi Jen had flattered herself that the words he had uttered the previous\nevening amounted to idle talk, and she had long ago dispelled all\nthought of them from her mind, but when Pao-yü unawares made further\nallusion to them, she smilingly rejoined: “You are verily somewhat\ncracked!”",
        "Pao-yü kept silent, and attempted to make no reply. Yet from this time\nhe fully apprehended that the lot of human affections is, in every\ninstance, subject to predestination, and time and again he was wont to\nsecretly muse, with much anguish: “Who, I wonder, will shed tears for\nme, at my burial?”",
        "Lin Tai-yü, for we will now allude to her, noticed Pao-yü’s behaviour,\nbut readily concluding that he must have been, somewhere or other, once\nmore possessed by some malignant spirit, she did not feel it advisable\nto ask many questions. “I just saw,” she consequently observed, “my\nmaternal aunt, who hearing that to-morrow is Miss Hsüeh’s birthday, bade\nme come at my convenience to ask you whether you’ll go or not, (and to\ntell you) to send some one ahead to let them know what you mean to do.”",
        "“I didn’t go the other day, when it was Mr. Chia She’s birthday, so I\nwon’t go now.” Pao-yü answered. “If it is a matter of meeting any one, I\nwon’t go anywhere. On a hot day like this to again don my ceremonial\ndress! No, I won’t go. Aunt is not likely to feel displeased with me!”",
        "“What are you driving at?” Hsi Jen speedily ventured. “She couldn’t be\nput on the same footing as our senior master! She lives close by here.\nBesides she’s a relative. Why, if you don’t go, won’t you make her\nimagine things? Well, if you dread the heat, just get up at an early\nhour and go over and prostrate yourself before her, and come back again,\nafter you’ve had a cup of tea. Won’t this look well?”",
        "Before Pao-yü had time to say anything by way of response, Tai-yü\nanticipated him. “You should,” she smiled, “go as far as there for the\nsake of her, who drives the mosquitoes away from you.”",
        "Pao-yü could not make out the drift of her insinuation. “What about\ndriving mosquitoes away?” he vehemently inquired.",
        "Hsi Jen then explained to him how while he was fast asleep the previous\nday and no one was about to keep him company, Miss Pao-ch’ai had sat\nwith him for a while.",
        "“It shouldn’t have been done!” Pao-yü promptly exclaimed, after hearing\nher explanations. “But how did I manage to go to sleep and show such\nutter discourtesy to her? I must go to-morrow!” he then went on to add.\nBut while these words were still on his lips, he unexpectedly caught\nsight of Shih Hsian-yün walk in in full dress, to bid them adieu, as she\nsaid that some one had been sent from her home to fetch her away.",
        "The moment Pao-yü and Tai-yü heard what was the object of her visit,\nthey quickly rose to their feet and pressed her to take a seat. But Shih\nHsiang-yün would not sit down, so Pao-yü and Tai-yü were compelled to\nescort her as far as the front part of the mansion.",
        "Shih Hsiang-yün’s eyes were brimming with tears; but realising that\nseveral people from her home were present, she did not have the courage\nto give full vent to her feelings. But when shortly Pao-ch’ai ran over\nto find her, she felt so much the more drawn towards them, that she\ncould not brook to part from them. Pao-ch’ai, however, inwardly\nunderstood that if her people told her aunt anything on their return,\nthere would again be every fear of her being blown up, as soon as she\ngot back home, and she therefore urged her to start on her way. One and\nall then walked with her up to the second gate, and Pao-yü wished to\naccompany her still further outside, but Shih Hsiang-yün deterred him.\nPresently, they turned to go back. But once more, she called Pao-yü to\nher, and whispered to him in a soft tone of voice: “Should our venerable\nsenior not think of me do often allude to me, so that she should depute\nsome one to fetch me.”",
        "Pao-yü time after time assured her that he would comply with her wishes.\nAnd having followed her with their eyes, while she got into her curricle\nand started, they eventually retraced their steps towards the inner\ncompound. But, reader, if you like to follow up the story, peruse the\ndetails contained in the chapter below.",
