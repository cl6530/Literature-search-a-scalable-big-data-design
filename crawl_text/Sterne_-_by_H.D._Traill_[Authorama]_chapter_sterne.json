        "The materials for a biography of Sterne are by no means abundant.\nOf the earlier years of his life the only existing record is that\npreserved in the brief autobiographical memoir which, a few months\nbefore his death, he composed, in the usual quaint staccato style of\nhis familiar correspondence, for the benefit of his daughter. Of his\nchildhood; of his school-days; of his life at Cambridge, and in his\nYorkshire vicarage; of his whole history, in fact, up to the age of\nforty-six, we know nothing more than he has there jotted down. He\nattained that age in the year 1759; and at this date begins that\nseries of his Letters, from which, for those who have the patience\nto sort them out of the chronological confusion in which his daughter\nand editress involved them, there is, no doubt, a good deal to be\nlearnt. These letters, however, which extend down to 1768, the year\nof the writer’s death, contain pretty nearly all the contemporary\nmaterial that we have to depend on. Freely as Sterne mixed in the best\nliterary society, there is singularly little to be gathered about him,\neven in the way of chance allusion and anecdote, from the memoirs and\nana of his time. Of the many friends who would have been competent\nto write his biography while the facts were yet fresh, but one, John\nWilkes, ever entertained–if he did seriously entertain–the idea\nof performing this pious work; and he, in spite of the entreaties of\nSterne’s widow and daughter, then in straitened circumstances, left\nunredeemed his promise to do so. The brief memoir by Sir Walter Scott,\nwhich is prefixed to many popular editions of Tristram Shandy and\nthe Sentimental Journey, sets out the so-called autobiography in\nfull, but for the rest is mainly critical; Thackeray’s well-known\nlecture essay is almost wholly so; and nothing, worthy to be dignified\nby the name of a Life of Sterne, seems ever to have been published,\nuntil the appearance of Mr. Percy Fitzgerald’s two stout volumes,\nunder this title, some eighteen years ago. Of this work it is hardly\ntoo much to say that it contains (no doubt with the admixture of a\ngood deal of superfluous matter) nearly all the information as to the\nfacts of Sterne’s life that is now ever likely to be recovered. The\nevidence for certain of its statements of fact is not as thoroughly\nsifted as it might have been; and with some of its criticism I, at\nleast, am unable to agree. But no one interested in the subject of\nthis memoir can be insensible of his obligations to Mr. Fitzgerald\nfor the fruitful diligence with which he has laboured in a too long\nneglected field.",

        "Towards the close of the month of November, 1713, one of the last of\nthe English regiments which had been detained in Flanders to supervise\nthe execution of the treaty of Utrecht arrived at Clonmel from\nDunkirk. The day after its arrival the regiment was disbanded; and\nyet a few days later, on the 24th of the month, the wife of one of its\nsubalterns gave birth to a son. The child who thus early displayed the\nperversity of his humour by so inopportune an appearance was Laurence\nSterne. “My birthday,” he says, in the slipshod, loosely-strung\nnotes by which he has been somewhat grandiloquently said to have\n\"anticipated the labours” of the biographer–\"my birthday was ominous\nto my poor father, who was the day after our arrival, with many other\nbrave officers, broke and sent adrift into the wide world with a wife\nand two children.”",
        "Roger Sterne, however, now late ensign of the 34th, or Chudleigh’s\nregiment of foot, was after all in less evil case than were many,\nprobably, of his comrades. He had kinsmen to whom he could look for,\nat any rate, temporary assistance, and his mother was a wealthy widow.\nThe Sternes, originally of a Suffolk stock, had passed from that\ncounty to Nottinghamshire, and thence into Yorkshire, and were at\nthis time a family of position and substance in the last-named county.\nRoger’s grandfather had been Archbishop of York, and a man of more\nnote, if only through the accident of the times upon which he\nfell, than most of the incumbents of that see. He had played an\nexceptionally energetic part even for a Cavalier prelate in the great\npolitical struggle of the seventeenth century, and had suffered with\nfortitude and dignity in the royal cause. He had, moreover, a further\nclaim to distinction in having been treated with common gratitude\nat the Restoration by the son of the monarch whom he had served. As\nMaster of Jesus College, Cambridge, he had “been active in sending the\nUniversity plate to his Majesty,” and for this offence he was seized\nby Cromwell and carried in military custody to London, whence, after\nundergoing imprisonment in various goals, and experiencing other\nforms of hardship, he was at length permitted to retire to an obscure\nretreat in the country, there to commune with himself until that\ntyranny should be overpast. On the return of the exiled Stuarts\nDr. Sterne was made Bishop of Carlisle, and a few years later was\ntranslated to the see of York. He lived to the age of eighty-six, and\nso far justified Burnet’s accusation against him of “minding chiefly\nenriching himself,” that he seems to have divided no fewer than four\nlanded estates among his children. One of these, Simon Sterne,\na younger son of the Archbishop, himself married an heiress, the\ndaughter of Sir Roger Jaques of Elvington; and Roger, the father of\nLaurence Sterne, was the seventh and youngest of the issue of this\nmarriage. At the time when the double misfortune above recorded befell\nhim at the hands of Lucina and the War Office, his father had been\nsome years dead; but Simon Sterne’s widow was still mistress of\nthe property which she had brought with her at her marriage, and to\nElvington, accordingly, “as soon,” writes Sterne, “as I was able to be\ncarried,” the compulsorily retired ensign betook himself with his wife\nand his two children. He was not, however, compelled to remain long\ndependent on his mother. The ways of the military authorities were as\ninscrutable to the army of that day as they are in our day to our\nown. Before a year had passed the regiment was ordered to be\nre-established, and “our household decamped with bag and baggage for\nDublin.” This was in the autumn of 1714, and from that time onward,\nfor some eleven years, the movements and fortunes of the Sterne\nfamily, as detailed in the narrative of its most famous member, form a\nhistory in which the ludicrous struggles strangely with the pathetic.",
        "A husband, condemned to be the Ulysses-like plaything of adverse gods\nat the War Office; an indefatigably prolific wife; a succession of\nweak and ailing children; misfortune in the seasons of journeying;\nmisfortune in the moods of the weather by sea and land–under all this\ncombination of hostile chances and conditions was the struggle to\nbe carried on. The little household was perpetually “on the move\"–a\nlittle household which was always becoming and never remaining\nbigger–continually increased by births, only to be again reduced by\ndeaths–until the contest between the deadly hardships of travel and\nthe fatal fecundity of Mrs. Sterne was brought by events to a natural\nclose. Almost might the unfortunate lady have exclaimed, Quae regio\nin terris nostri non plena laboris? She passes from Ireland to\nEngland, and from England to Ireland, from inland garrison to sea-port\ntown and back again, incessantly bearing and incessantly burying\nchildren–until even her son in his narrative begins to speak of\nlosing one infant at this place, and “leaving another behind” on that\njourney, almost as if they were so many overlooked or misdirected\narticles of luggage. The tragic side of the history, however,\novershadows the grotesque. When we think how hard a business was\ntravel even under the most favourable conditions in those days,\nand how serious even in our own times, when travel is easy, are the\ndiscomforts of the women and children of a regiment on the march–we\nmay well pity these unresting followers of the drum. As to Mrs. Sterne\nherself, she seems to have been a woman of a pretty tough fibre, and\nshe came moreover of a campaigning stock. Her father was a “noted\nsuttler” of the name of Nuttle, and her first husband–for she was a\nwidow when Roger Sterne married her–had been a soldier also. She\nhad, therefore, served some years’ apprenticeship to the military life\nbefore these wanderings began; and she herself was destined to live to\na good old age. But somehow or other she failed to endow her offspring\nwith her own robust constitution and powers of endurance. “My father’s\nchildren were,” as Laurence Sterne grimly puts it, “not made to last\nlong;” but one cannot help suspecting that it was the hardships of\nthose early years which carried them off in their infancy with such\npainful regularity and despatch, and that it was to the same cause\nthat their surviving brother owed the beginnings of that fatal malady\nby which his own life was cut short.",
        "The diary of their travels–for the early part of Sterne’s memoirs\namounts to scarcely more–is the more effective for its very brevity\nand abruptness. Save for one interval of somewhat longer sojourn than\nusual at Dublin, the reader has throughout it all the feeling of\nthe traveller who never finds time to unpack his portmanteau. On\nthe re-enrolment of the regiment in 1714, “our household,” says the\nnarrative, “decamped from York with bag and baggage for Dublin. Within\na month my father left us, being ordered to Exeter; where, in a sad\nwinter, my mother and her two children followed him, travelling from\nLiverpool, by land, to Plymouth.” At Plymouth Mrs. Sterne gave birth\nto a son, christened Joram; and, “in twelve months time we were all\nsent back to Dublin. My mother,” with her three children, “took ship\nat Bristol for Ireland, and had a narrow escape from being cast away\nby a leak springing up in the vessel. At length, after many perils\nand struggles, we got to Dublin.” Here intervenes the short\nbreathing-space, of which mention has been made–an interval\nemployed by Roger Sterne in “spending a great deal of money” on a\n\"large house,” which he hired and furnished; and then “in the year one\nthousand seven hundred and nineteen, all unhinged again.” The regiment\nhad been ordered off to the Isle of Wight, thence to embark for Spain,\non “the Vigo Expedition,” and “we,” who accompanied it, “were driven\ninto Milford Haven, but afterwards landed at Bristol, and thence by\nland to Plymouth again, and to the Isle of Wight;” losing on this\nexpedition “poor Joram, a pretty boy, who died of the smallpox.” In\nthe Isle of Wight, Mrs. Sterne and her family remained till the Vigo\nExpedition returned home; and during her stay there “poor Joram’s loss\nwas supplied by the birth of a girl, Anne,” a “pretty blossom,” but\ndestined to fall “at the age of three years.” On the return of the\nregiment to Wicklow, Roger Sterne again sent to collect his family\naround him. “We embarked for Dublin, and had all been cast away by a\nmost violent storm; but, through the intercession of my mother, the\ncaptain was prevailed upon to turn back into Wales, where we stayed\na month, and at length got into Dublin, and travelled by land to\nWicklow, where my father had, for some weeks, given us over for lost.\"\nHere a year passed, and another child, Devijeher–so called after the\ncolonel of the regiment–was born. “From thence we decamped to stay\nhalf a year with Mr. Fetherston, a clergyman, about seven miles from\nWicklow, who, being a relative of my mother’s, invited us to his\nparsonage at Animo.[1]” From thence, again, “we followed the regiment\nto Dublin,” where again “we lay in the barracks a year.” In 1722 the\nregiment was ordered to Carrickfergus. “We all decamped, but got no\nfurther than Drogheda; thence ordered to Mullingar, forty miles west,\nwhere, by Providence, we stumbled upon a kind relation, a collateral\ndescendant from Archbishop Sterne, who took us all to his castle, and\nkindly entertained us for a year.” Thence, by “a most rueful journey,\"\nto Carrickfergus, where “we arrived in six or seven days.” Here, at\nthe age of three, little Devijeher obtained a happy release from his\nname; and “another child, Susan, was sent to fill his place, who also\nleft us behind in this weary journey.” In the “autumn of this year, or\nthe spring of the next\"–Sterne’s memory failing in exactitude at the\nvery point where we should have expected it to be most precise–\"my\nfather obtained permission of his colonel to fix me at school;” and\nhenceforth the boy’s share in the family wanderings was at an end. But\nhis father had yet to be ordered from Carrickfergus to Londonderry,\nwhere at last a permanent child, Catherine, was born; and thence to\nGibraltar, to take part in the Defence of that famous Rock, where the\nmuch-enduring campaigner was run through the body in a duel, “about\na goose” (a thoroughly Shandian catastrophe); and thence to Jamaica,\nwhere, “with a constitution impaired” by the sword-thrust earned in\nhis anserine quarrel, he was defeated in a more deadly duel with the\n\"country fever,” and died. “His malady,” writes his son, with a touch\nof feeling struggling through his dislocated grammar, “took away his\nsenses first, and made a child of him; and then in a month or two\nwalking about continually without complaining, till the moment he sat\ndown in an arm-chair and breathed his last.”",
        "[Footnote 1: “It was in this parish,” says Sterne, “that I had that\nwonderful escape in falling through a mill race while the mill was\ngoing, and being taken up unhurt; the story is incredible, but known\nto all that part of Ireland, where hundreds of the common people\nflocked to seeme.” More incredible still does it seem that Thoresby\nshould relate the occurrence of an accident of precisely the same kind\nto Sterne’s great-grandfather, the Archbishop. “Playing near a mill,\nhe fell within a claw; there was but one board or bucket wanting in\nthe whole wheel, but a gracious Providence so ordered it that the void\nplace came down at that moment, else he had been crushed to death; but\nwas reserved to be a grand benefactor afterwards.” (Thoresby, ii. 15.)\nBut what will probably strike the reader as more extraordinary even\nthan this coincidence is that Sterne should have been either unaware\nof it, or should have omitted mention of it in the above passage.]",
        "There is, as has been observed, a certain mixture of the comic and the\npathetic in the life-history of this obscure father of a famous\nson. His life was clearly not a fortunate one, so far as external\ncircumstances go; but its misfortunes had no sort of consoling dignity\nabout them. Roger Sterne’s lot in the world was not so much an unhappy\nas an uncomfortable one; and discomfort earns little sympathy, and\nabsolutely no admiration, for its sufferers. He somehow reminds us\nof one of those Irish heroes–good-natured, peppery, debt-loaded,\nlight-hearted, shiftless–whose fortunes we follow with mirthful and\nhalf-contemptuous sympathy in the pages of Thackeray. He was obviously\na typical specimen of that class of men who are destitute alike of the\nvirtues and failings of the “respectable” and successful; whom many\npeople love and no one respects; whom everybody pities in their\nstruggles and difficulties, but whom few pity without a smile.",
        "It is evident, however, that he succeeded in winning the affection of\none who had not too much affection of the deeper kind to spare for any\none. The figure of Roger Sterne alone stands out with any clearness by\nthe side of the ceaselessly flitting mother and phantasmal children of\nLaurence Sterne’s Memoir; and it is touched in with strokes so vivid\nand characteristic that critics have been tempted to find in it\nthe original of the most famous portrait in the Shandy gallery. “My\nfather,” says Sterne, “was a little, smart man, active to the last\ndegree in all exercises, most patient of fatigue and disappointments,\nof which it pleased God to give him full measure. He was, in his\ntemper, somewhat rapid and hasty, but of a kindly, sweet disposition,\nvoid of all design, and so innocent in his own intentions, that he\nsuspected no one; so that you might have cheated him ten times a\nday, if nine had not been sufficient for your purpose.” This is a\ncaptivating little picture; and it no doubt presents traits which may\nhave impressed themselves early and deeply on the imagination which\nwas afterwards to give birth to “My Uncle Toby.” The simplicity of\nnature and the “kindly, sweet disposition” are common to both the\nensign of real life and to the immortal Captain Shandy of fiction; but\nthe criticism which professes to find traces of Roger Sterne’s “rapid\nand hasty temper” in my Uncle Toby is compelled to strain itself\nconsiderably. And, on the whole, there seems no reason to believe that\nSterne borrowed more from the character of his father than any\nwriter must necessarily, and perhaps unconsciously, borrow from his\nobservation of the moral and mental qualities of those with whom he\nhas come into most frequent contact.",
        "That Laurence Sterne passed the first eleven years of his life with\nsuch an exemplar of these simple virtues of kindliness, guilelessness,\nand courage ever before him, is perhaps the best that can be said\nfor the lot in which his early days were cast. In almost all other\nrespects there could hardly have been–for a quick-witted, precocious,\nimitative boy–a worse bringing-up. No one, I should imagine, ever\nmore needed discipline in his youth than Sterne; and the camp is a\nplace of discipline for the soldier only. To all others whom necessity\nattaches to it, and to the young especially, it is rather a school of\nlicense and irregularity. It is fair to remember these disadvantages\nof Sterne’s early training, in judging of the many defects as a man,\nand laxities as a writer, which marked his later life; though, on the\nother hand, there is no denying the reality and value of some of\nthe countervailing advantages which came to him from his boyish\nsurroundings. The conception of my Uncle Toby need not have been taken\nwhole from Roger Sterne, or from any one actual captain of a marching\nregiment; but the constant sight of, and converse with, many captains\nand many corporals may undoubtedly have contributed much to the vigour\nand vitality of Toby Shandy and Corporal Trim. So far as the externals\nof portraiture were concerned, there can be no doubt that his art\nbenefited much from his early military life. His soldiers have the\ntrue stamp of the soldier about them in air and language; and when\nhis captain and corporal fight their Flemish battles over again we are\nthoroughly conscious that we are listening, under the dramatic form,\nto one who must himself have heard many a chapter of the same splendid\nstory from the lips of the very men who had helped to break the pride\nof the Grand Monarque under Marlborough and Eugene.",
        "(1723-1738.)",
        "It was not–as we have seen from the Memoir–till the autumn of 1723,\n\"or the spring of the following year,” that Roger Sterne obtained\nleave of his colonel to “fix” his son at school; and this would bring\nLaurence to the tolerably advanced age of ten before beginning his\neducation in any systematic way. He records, under date of 1721, that\n\"in this year I learned to write, &c.;” but it is not probable that\nthe “&c.\"–that indolent symbol of which Sterne makes such irritating\nuse in all his familiar writing–covers, in this case, any wide extent\nof educational advance. The boy, most likely, could just read and\nwrite, and no more, at the time when he was fixed at school, “near\nHalifax, with an able master:” a judicious selection, no doubt, both\nof place as well as teacher. Mr. Fitzgerald, to whose researches we\nowe as much light as is ever likely to be thrown upon this obscure and\nprobably not very interesting period of Sterne’s life, has pointed out\nthat Richard Sterne, eldest son of the late Simon Sterne, and uncle,\ntherefore, of Laurence, was one of the governors of Halifax Grammar\nSchool, and that he may have used his interest to obtain his nephew’s\nadmission to the foundation as the grandson of a Halifax man, and so,\nconstructively, a child of the parish. But, be this as it may, it\nis more than probable that from the time when he was sent to Halifax\nSchool the whole care and cost of the boy’s education was borne by his\nYorkshire relatives. The Memoir says that, “by God’s care of me, my\ncousin Sterne, of Elvington, became a father to me, and sent me to\nthe University, &c., &c.;” and it is to be inferred from this that the\nbenevolent guardianship of Sterne’s uncle Richard (who died in 1732,\nthe year before Laurence was admitted of Jesus College, Cambridge)\nmust have been taken up by his son. Of his school course–though it\nlasted for over seven years–the autobiographer has little to say;\nnothing, indeed, except that he “cannot omit mentioning” that anecdote\nwith which everybody, I suppose, who has ever come across the briefest\nnotice of Sterne’s life is familiar. The schoolmaster “had the ceiling\nof the schoolroom new-whitewashed, and the ladder remained there. I,\none unlucky day, mounted it, and wrote with a brush, in large capital\nletters, LAU. STERNE for which the usher severely whipped me. My\nmaster was very much hurt at this, and said before me that never\nshould that name be effaced, for I was a boy of genius, and he was\nsure I should come to preferment. This expression made me forget the\nblows I had received.” It is hardly to be supposed, of course, that\nthis story is pure romance; but it is difficult, on the other hand,\nto believe that the incident has been related by Sterne exactly as it\nhappened. That the recorded prediction may have been made in jest–or\neven in earnest (for penetrating teachers have these prophetic moments\nsometimes)–is, of course, possible; but that Sterne’s master was\n\"very much hurt” at the boy’s having been justly punished for an act\nof wanton mischief, or that he recognized it as the natural privilege\nof nascent genius to deface newly-whitewashed ceilings, must have been\na delusion of the humourist’s later years. The extreme fatuity which\nit would compel us to attribute to the schoolmaster seems inconsistent\nwith the power of detecting intellectual capacity in any one else. On\nthe whole, one inclines to suspect that the remark belonged to that\norder of half sardonic, half kindly jest which a certain sort\nof pedagogue sometimes throws off, for the consolation of a\nrecently-caned boy; and that Sterne’s vanity, either then or\nafterwards (for it remained juvenile all his life), translated it into\na serious prophecy. In itself, however, the urchin’s freak was only\ntoo unhappily characteristic of the man. The trick of befouling what\nwas clean (and because it was clean) clung to him most tenaciously all\nhis days; and many a fair white surface–of humour, of fancy, or of\nsentiment–was to be disfigured by him in after-years with stains\nand splotches in which we can all too plainly decipher the literary\nsignature of Laurence Sterne.",
        "At Halifax School the boy, as has been said, remained for about eight\nyears; that is, until he was nearly nineteen, and for some months\nafter his father’s death at Port Antonio, which occurred in March,\n1731. “In the year ’32,” says the Memoir, “my cousin sent me to the\nUniversity, where I stayed some time.” In the course of his first year\nhe read for and obtained a sizarship, to which the college records\nshow that he was duly admitted on the 6th of July, 1733. The selection\nof Jesus College was a natural one: Sterne’s great-grandfather,\nthe afterwards Archbishop, had been its Master, and had founded\nscholarships there, to one of which the young sizar was, a year after\nhis admission, elected. No inference can, of course, be drawn from\nthis as to Sterne’s proficiency, or even industry, in his academical\nstudies: it is scarcely more than a testimony to the fact of decent\nand regular behaviour. He was bene natus, in the sense of being\nrelated to the right man, the founder; and in those days he need\nbe only very modicé doctus indeed in order to qualify himself for\nadmission to the enjoyment of his kinsman’s benefactions. Still he\nmust have been orderly and well-conducted in his ways; and this he\nwould also seem to have been, from the fact of his having passed\nthrough his University course without any apparent break or hitch, and\nhaving been admitted to his Bachelor’s degree after no more than the\nnormal period of residence. The only remark which, in the Memoir, he\nvouchsafes to bestow upon his academical career is, that “’twas there\nthat I commenced a friendship with Mr. H––, which has been lasting\non both sides;” and it may, perhaps, be said that this was, from one\npoint of view, the most important event of his Cambridge life. For Mr.\nH–– was John Hall, afterwards John Hall Stevenson, the “Eugenius” of\nTristram Shandy, the master of Skelton Castle, at which Sterne was,\nthroughout life, to be a frequent and most familiar visitor; and,\nunfortunately, also a person whose later reputation, both as a man and\na writer, became such as seriously to compromise the not very robust\nrespectability of his clerical comrade. Sterne and Hall were distant\ncousins, and it may have been the tie of consanguinity which first\ndrew them together. But there was evidently a thorough congeniality of\nthe most unlucky sort between them; and from their first meeting, as\nundergraduates at Jesus, until the premature death of the elder, they\ncontinued to supply each other’s minds with precisely that sort of\noccupation and stimulus of which each by the grace of nature stood\nleast in need. That their close intimacy was ill-calculated to raise\nSterne’s reputation in later years may be inferred from the fact\nthat Hall Stevenson afterwards obtained literary notoriety by the\npublication of Crazy Tales, a collection of comic but extremely\nbroad ballads, in which his clerical friend was quite unjustly\nsuspected of having had a hand. Mr. Hall was also reported,\nwhether truly or falsely, to have been a member of Wilkes’s famous\nconfraternity of Medmenham Abbey; and from this it was an easy step\nfor gossip to advance to the assertion that the Rev. Mr. Sterne had\nhimself been admitted to that unholy order.",
        "Among acquaintances which the young sizar of Jesus might have more\nprofitably made at Cambridge, but did not, was that of a student\ndestined, like himself, to leave behind him a name famous in English\nletters. Gray, born three years later than Sterne, had entered a\nyear after him at Cambridge as a pensioner of Peterhouse, and the two\nstudents went through their terms together, though the poet at the\ntime took no degree. There was probably little enough in common\nbetween the shy, fastidious, slightly effeminate pensioner of\nPeterhouse, and a scholar of Jesus, whose chief friend and comrade was\na man like Hall; and no close intimacy between the two men, if they\nhad come across each other, would have been very likely to arise.\nBut it does not appear that they could have ever met or heard of each\nother, for Gray writes of Sterne, after Tristram Shandy had made\nhim famous, in terms which clearly show that he did not recall his\nfellow-undergraduate.",
        "In January, 1736, Sterne took his B.A. degree, and quitted Cambridge\nfor York, where another of his father’s brothers now makes his\nappearance as his patron. Dr. Jacques Sterne was the second son of\nSimon Sterne, of Elvington, and a man apparently of more marked and\nvigorous character than any of his brothers. What induced him now to\ntake notice of the nephew, whom in boyhood and early youth he had left\nto the unshared guardianship of his brother, and brother’s son,\ndoes not appear; but the personal history of this energetic\npluralist–Prebendary of Durham, Archdeacon of Cleveland, Canon\nResidentiary, Precentor, Prebendary, and Archdeacon of York, Rector of\nRise, and Rector of Hornsey-cum-Riston–suggests the surmise that he\ndetected qualities in the young Cambridge graduate which would\nmake him useful. For Dr. Sterne was a typical specimen of the\nChurchman-politician, in days when both components of the compound\nword meant a good deal more than they do now. The Archdeacon was a\ndevoted Whig, a Hanoverian to the backbone; and he held it his duty\nto support the Protestant succession, not only by the spiritual but by\nthe secular arm. He was a great electioneerer, as befitted times when\nthe claims of two rival dynasties virtually met upon the hustings, and\nhe took a prominent part in the great Yorkshire contest of the year\n1734. His most vigorous display of energy, however, was made, as was\nnatural, in “the ’45.” The Whig Archdeacon, not then Archdeacon of\nthe East Riding, nor as yet quite buried under the mass of preferments\nwhich he afterwards accumulated, seems to have thought that this\nindeed was the crisis of his fortunes, and that, unless he was\nprepared to die a mere prebendary, canon, and rector of one or two\nbenefices, now was the time to strike a blow for his advancement\nin the Church. His bustling activity at this trying time was indeed\nportentous, and at last took the form of arresting the unfortunate\nDr. Burton (the original of Dr. Slop), on suspicion of holding\ncommunication with the invading army of the Pretender, then on its\nmarch southward from Edinburgh. The suspect, who was wholly innocent,\nwas taken to London and kept in custody for nearly a year before\nbeing discharged, after which, by way of a slight redress, a letter\nof reprimand for his trop de zèle was sent by direction of\nLord Carteret to the militant dignitary. But the desired end was\nnevertheless attained, and Dr. Sterne succeeded in crowning the\nedifice of his ecclesiastical honours.[1]",
        "[Footnote 1: A once-familiar piece of humorous verse describes the\nupset of a coach containing a clerical pluralist:",
        "  “When struggling on the ground was seen\n  A Rector, Vicar, Canon, Dean;\n  You might have thought the coach was full,\n  But no! ’twas only Dr. Bull.”",
        "Dr. Jacques Sterne, however, might have been thrown out of one of the\nmore capacious vehicles of the London General Omnibus Company, with\nalmost the same misleading effect upon those who only heard of the\nmishap.]",
        "There can be little doubt that patronage extended by such an uncle to\nsuch a nephew received its full equivalent in some way or other, and\nindeed the Memoir gives us a clue to the mode in which payment was\nmade. “My uncle,” writes Sterne, describing their subsequent rupture,\n\"quarrelled with me because I would not write paragraphs in the\nnewspapers; though he was a party-man, I was not, and detested such\ndirty work, thinking it beneath me. From that time he became my\nbitterest enemy.” The date of this quarrel cannot be precisely fixed;\nbut we gather from an autograph letter (now in the British Museum)\nfrom Sterne to Archdeacon Blackburne that by the year 1750 the two men\nhad for some time ceased to be on friendly terms. Probably, however,\nthe breach occurred subsequently to the rebellion of ’45, and it may\nbe that it arose out of the excess of partisan zeal which Dr. Sterne\ndeveloped in that year, and which his nephew very likely did not, in\nhis opinion, sufficiently share. But this is quite consistent with the\nyounger man’s having up to that time assisted the elder in his party\npolemics. He certainly speaks in his “Letters” of his having “employed\nhis brains for an ungrateful person,” and the remark is made in a way\nand in a connexion which seems to imply that the services rendered\nto his uncle were mainly literary. If so, his declaration that he\n\"would not write paragraphs in the newspapers” can only mean that\nhe would not go on writing them. Be this as it may, however, it\nis certain that the Archdeacon for some time found his account in\nmaintaining friendly relations with his nephew, and that during that\nperiod he undoubtedly did a good deal for his advancement. Sterne was\nordained deacon by the Bishop of Lincoln in March, 1736, only three\nmonths after taking his B.A. degree, and took priest’s orders in\nAugust, 1738, whereupon his uncle immediately obtained for him the\nliving of Sutton-on-the-Forest, into which he was inducted a few days\nafterwards. Other preferments followed, to be noted hereafter; and\nit must be admitted that until the quarrel occurred about the “party\nparagraphs” the Archdeacon did his duty by his nephew after the\npeculiar fashion of that time. When that quarrel came, however, it\nseems to have snapped more ties than one, for in the Memoir Sterne\nspeaks of his youngest sister Catherine as “still living, but most\nunhappily estranged from me by my uncle’s wickedness and her own\nfolly.” Of his elder sister Mary, who was born at Lille a year before\nhimself, he records that “she married one Weemans in Dublin, who used\nher most unmercifully, spent his substance, became a bankrupt, and\nleft my poor sister to shift for herself, which she was able to do but\nfor a few months, for she went to a friend’s house in the country and\ndied of a broken heart.” Truly an unlucky family.[1] Only three to\nsurvive the hardships among which the years of their infancy were\npassed, and this to be the history of two out of the three survivors!",
        "[Footnote 1: The mother, Mrs. Sterne, makes her appearance once more\nfor a moment in or about the year 1758. Horace Walpole, and after him\nByron, accused Sterne of having “preferred whining over a dead ass to\nrelieving a living mother,” and the former went so far as to declare\n\"on indubitable authority” that Mrs. Sterne, “who kept a school (in\nIreland), having run in debt on account of an extravagant daughter,\nwould have rotted in a gaol if the parents of her scholars had not\nraised a subscription for her.” Even “the indubitable authority,\"\nhowever, does not positively assert–whatever may be meant to be\ninsinuated–that Sterne himself did nothing to assist his mother, and\nMr. Fitzgerald justly points out that to pay the whole debts of a\nbankrupt school might well have been beyond a Yorkshire clergyman’s\nmeans. Anyhow there is evidence that Sterne at a later date than this\nwas actively concerning himself about his mother’s interests. She\nafterwards came to York, whither he went to meet her; and he then\nwrites to a friend: “I trust my poor mother’s affair is by this time\nended to our comfort and hers.\"]",
        "(1738-1759.)",
        "Great writers who spring late and suddenly from obscurity into fame\nand yet die early, must always form more or less perplexing subjects\nof literary biography. The processes of their intellectual and\nartistic growth lie hidden in nameless years; their genius is not\nrevealed to the world until it has reached its full maturity, and many\naspects of it, which, perhaps, would have easily explained themselves\nif the gradual development had gone on before men’s eyes, remain\noften unexplained to the last. By few, if any, of the more celebrated\nEnglish men of letters is this observation so forcibly illustrated as\nit is in the case of Sterne: the obscure period of his life so greatly\nexceeded in duration the brief season of his fame, and its obscurity\nwas so exceptionally profound. He was forty-seven years of age when,\nat a bound, he achieved celebrity; he was not five-and-fifty when he\ndied. And though it might be too much to say that the artist sprang,\nlike the reputation, full-grown into being, it is nevertheless true\nthat there are no marks of positive immaturity to be detected even in\nthe earliest public displays of his art. His work grows, indeed, most\nmarvellously in vividness and symmetry as he proceeds, but there\nare no visible signs of growth in the workman’s skill. Even when the\nhighest point of finish is attained we cannot say that the hand is any\nmore cunning than it was from the first. As well might we say that the\nlast light touches of the sculptor’s chisel upon the perfected statue\nare more skilful than its first vigorous strokes upon the shapeless\nblock.",
        "It is certain, however, that Sterne must have been storing up his\nmaterial of observation, secreting his reflections on life and\ncharacter, and consciously or unconsciously maturing his powers of\nexpression, during the whole of those silent twenty years which have\nnow to be passed under brief review. With one exception, to be noted\npresently, the only known writings of his which belong to this\nperiod are sermons, and these–a mere “scratch” collection of pulpit\ndiscourses, which, as soon as he had gained the public ear, he\nhastened in characteristic fashion to rummage from his desk and carry\nto the book-market–throw no light upon the problem before us. There\nare sermons of Sterne which alike in manner and matter disclose the\nauthor of Tristram Shandy; but they are not among those which he\npreached or wrote before that work was given to the world. They\nare not its ancestors but its descendants. They belong to the\npost-Shandian period, and are in obvious imitation of the Shandian\nstyle; while in none of the earlier ones–not even in that famous\nhomily on a Good Conscience, which did not succeed till Corporal Trim\npreached it before the brothers Shandy and Dr. Slop–can we trace\neither the trick of style or the turn of thought that give piquancy to\nthe novel. Yet the peculiar qualities of mind, and the special faculty\nof workmanship of which this turn of thought and trick of style were\nthe product, must of course have been potentially present from the\nbeginning. Men do not blossom forth as wits, humourists, masterly\ndelineators of character, and skilful performers on a highly-strung\nand carefully-tuned sentimental instrument all at once, after entering\ntheir “forties;” and the only wonder is that a possessor of these\npowers–some of them of the kind which, as a rule, and in most men,\nseeks almost as irresistibly for exercise as even the poetic instinct\nitself–should have been held so long unemployed. There is, however,\none very common stimulus to literary exertions which in Sterne’s case\nwas undoubtedly wanting–a superabundance of unoccupied time. We\nhave little reason, it is true, to suppose that this light-minded\nand valetudinarian Yorkshire parson was at any period of his life an\nindustrious “parish priest;” but it is probable, nevertheless, that\ntime never hung very heavily upon his hands. In addition to the\nfavourite amusements which he enumerates in the Memoir, he was all\nhis days addicted to one which is, perhaps, the most absorbing of\nall–flirtation. Philandering, and especially philandering of the\nPlatonic and ultra-sentimental order, is almost the one human\npastime of which its votaries never seem to tire; and its constant\nministrations to human vanity may serve, perhaps, to account for their\nunwearied absorption in its pursuit. Sterne’s first love affair–an\naffair of which, unfortunately, the consequences were more lasting\nthan the passion–took place immediately upon his leaving Cambridge.\nTo relate it as he relates it to his daughter: “At York I became\nacquainted with your mother, and courted her for two years. She owned\nshe liked me, but thought herself not rich enough or me too poor to\nbe joined together. She went to her sister’s in Staffordshire, and I\nwrote to her often. I believe then she was partly determined to have\nme, but would not say so. At her return she fell into a consumption,\nand one evening that I was sitting by her, with an almost broken heart\nto see her so ill, she said: ’My dear Laury, I never can be yours, for\nI verily believe I have not long to live! But I have left you every\nshilling of my fortune.’ Upon that she showed me her will. This\ngenerosity overpowered me. It pleased God that she recovered, and we\nwere married in 1741.” The name of this lady was Elizabeth Lumley, and\nit was to her that Sterne addressed those earliest letters which his\ndaughter included in the collection published by her some eight years\nafter her father’s death. They were added, the preface tells us, “in\njustice to Mr. Sterne’s delicate feelings;” and in our modern usage\nof the word “delicate,” as equivalent to infirm of health and probably\nshort of life, they no doubt do full justice to the passion which they\nare supposed to express. It would be unfair, of course, to judge any\nlove-letters of that period by the standard of sincerity applied in\nour own less artificial age. All such compositions seem frigid and\nformal enough to us of to-day; yet in most cases of genuine attachment\nwe usually find at least a sentence here and there in which the\nnatural accents of the heart make themselves heard above the affected\nmodulations of the style. But the letters of Sterne’s courtship\nmaintain the pseudo-poetic, shepherd-and-shepherdess strain\nthroughout; or, if the lover ever abandons it, it is only to make\nsomewhat maudlin record of those “tears” which flowed a little too\neasily at all times throughout his life. These letters, however, have\na certain critical interest in their bearing upon those sensibilities\nwhich Sterne afterwards learned to cultivate in a forcing-frame, with\na view to the application of their produce to the purposes of an\nart of pathetic writing which simulates nature with such admirable\nfidelity at its best, and descends to such singular bathos at its\nworst.",
        "The marriage preluded by this courtship did not take place till\nSterne had already been three years Vicar of Sutton-on-the-Forest, the\nbenefice which had been procured for him by his uncle the Archdeacon;\nthrough whose interest also he was appointed successively to two\nprebends–preferments which were less valuable to him for their\nemolument than for the ecclesiastical status which they conferred upon\nhim, for the excuse which they gave him for periodical visits to the\ncathedral city to fulfil the residential conditions of his offices,\nand for the opportunity thus afforded him of mixing in and studying\nthe society of the Close. Upon his union with Miss Lumley, and, in a\nsomewhat curious fashion, by her means, he obtained in addition the\nliving of Stillington. “A friend of hers in the South had promised her\nthat if she married a clergyman in Yorkshire, when the living became\nvacant he would make her a compliment of it;” and made accordingly\nthis singular “compliment” was. At Sutton Sterne remained nearly\ntwenty years, doing duty at both places, during which time\n\"books, painting, fiddling, and shooting were,” he says, “my chief\namusements.” With what success he shot, and with what skill he\nfiddled, we know not. His writings contain not a few musical\nmetaphors and allusions to music, which seem to indicate a competent\nacquaintance with its technicalities; but the specimen of his\npowers as an artist, which Mr. Fitzgerald has reproduced from his\nillustrations of a volume of poems by Mr. Woodhull, does not dispose\none to rate highly his proficiency in this accomplishment. We may\nexpect that, after all, it was the first-mentioned of his amusements\nin which he took the greatest delight, and that neither the brush,\nthe bow, nor the fowling-piece was nearly so often in his hand as\nthe book. Within a few miles of Sutton, at Skelton Castle, an almost\nunique Roman stronghold, since modernized by Gothic hands, dwelt\nhis college-friend John Hall Stevenson, whose well-stocked library\ncontained a choice but heterogeneous collection of books–old French\n\"ana,” and the learning of mediaeval doctors–books intentionally and\nbooks unintentionally comic, the former of which Sterne read with an\nonly too retentive a memory for their jests, and the latter with an\nacutely humorous appreciation of their solemn trifling. Later on it\nwill be time to note the extent to which he utilized these results of\nhis widely discursive reading, and to examine the legitimacy of the\nmode in which he used them: here it is enough to say generally that\nthe materials for many a burlesque chapter of Tristram Shandy must\nhave been unconsciously storing themselves in his mind in many an\namused hour passed by Sterne in the library of Skelton Castle.",
        "But before finally quitting this part of my subject it may be as well,\nperhaps, to deal somewhat at length with a matter which will doubtless\nhave to be many times incidentally referred to in the course of this\nstudy, but which I now hope to relieve myself from the necessity of\ndoing more than touch upon hereafter. I refer of course to Sterne’s\nperpetually recurring flirtations. This is a matter almost as\nimpossible to omit from any biography of Sterne as it would be to omit\nit from any biography of Goethe. The English humourist did not, it\nis true, engage in the pastime in the serious, not to say scientific,\nspirit of the German philosopher-poet; it was not deliberately made by\nthe former as by the latter to contribute to his artistic development;\nbut it is nevertheless hardly open to doubt that Sterne’s philandering\npropensities did exercise an influence upon his literary character and\nwork in more ways than one. That his marriage was an ill-assorted and\nunhappy union was hardly so much the cause of his inconstancy as its\neffect. It may well be, of course, that the “dear L.,” whose moral and\nmental graces her lover had celebrated in such superfine, sentimental\nfashion, was a commonplace person enough. That she was really a woman\nof the exquisite stolidity of Mrs. Shandy, and that her exasperating\nfeats as an assentatrix did, as has been suggested, supply the model\nfor the irresistibly ludicrous colloquies between the philosopher\nand his wife, there is no sufficient warrant for believing. But it\nis quite possible that the daily companion of one of the most\nindefatigable jesters that ever lived may have been unable to see\na joke; that she regarded her husband’s wilder drolleries as mere\nhorse-collar grimacing, and that the point of his subtler humour\nescaped her altogether. But even if it were so, it is, to say the\nleast of it, doubtful whether Sterne suffered at all on this ground\nfrom the wounded feelings of the mari incompris, while it is next to\ncertain that it does not need the sting of any such disappointment\nto account for his alienation. He must have had plenty of time and\nopportunity to discover Miss Lumley’s intellectual limitations during\nthe two years of his courtship; and it is not likely that, even if\nthey were as well marked as Mrs. Shandy’s own, they would have\ndone much of themselves to estrange the couple. Sympathy is not the\nnecessity to the humourist which the poet finds, or imagines, it to be\nto himself: the humourist, indeed, will sometimes contrive to extract\nfrom the very absence of sympathy in those about him a keener relish\nfor his reflections. With sentiment, indeed, and still more with\nsentimentalism, the case would of course be different; but as for Mr.\nSterne’s demands for sympathy in that department of his life and art,\none may say without the least hesitation that they would have been\nbeyond the power of any one woman, however distinguished a disciple of\nthe “Laura Matilda” school, to satisfy. “I must ever,” he frankly\nsays in one of the “Yorick to Eliza” letters, “I must ever have some\nDulcinea in my head: it harmonizes the soul;” and he might have added\nthat he found it impossible to sustain the harmony without frequently\nchanging the Dulcinea. One may suspect that Mrs. Sterne soon had cause\nfor jealousy, and it is at least certain that several years before\nSterne’s emergence into notoriety their estrangement was complete. One\ndaughter was born to them in 1745, but lived scarcely mare than long\nenough to be rescued from the limbus infantium by the prompt\nrites of the Church. The child was christened Lydia, and died on the\nfollowing day. Its place was filled in 1747 by a second daughter, also\nchristened Lydia, who lived to become the wife of M. de Medalle, and\nthe not very judicious editress of the posthumous “Letters.” For\nher as she grew up Sterne conceived a genuine and truly fatherly\naffection, and it is in writing to her and of her that we see him at\nhis best; or rather one might say it is almost only then that we can\ndistinguish the true notes of the heart through that habitual falsetto\nof sentimentalism which distinguishes most of Sterne’s communications\nwith the other sex. There was no subsequent issue of the marriage,\nand, from one of the letters most indiscreetly included in Madame de\nMedalle’s collection, it is to be ascertained that some four years or\nso after Lydia’s birth the relations between Sterne and Mrs. Sterne\nceased to be conjugal, and never again resumed that character.",
        "It is, however, probable, upon the husband’s own confessions, that he\nhad given his wife earlier cause for jealousy, and certainly from the\ntime when he begins to reveal himself in correspondence there seems to\nbe hardly a moment when some such cause was not in existence–in the\nperson of this, that, or the other lackadaisical damsel or coquettish\nmatron. From Miss Fourmantelle, the “dear, dear Kitty,” to whom Sterne\nwas making violent love in 1759, the year of the York publication\nof Tristram Shandy, down to Mrs. Draper, the heroine of the famous\n\"Yorick to Eliza” letters, the list of ladies who seem to have kindled\nflames in that susceptible breast is almost as long and more real\nthan the roll of mistresses immortalized by Horace. How Mrs. Sterne at\nfirst bore herself under her husband’s ostentatious neglect there\nis no direct evidence to show. That she ultimately took refuge in\nindifference we can perceive, but it is to be feared that she was not\nalways able to maintain the attitude of contemptuous composure. So, at\nleast, we may suspect from the evidence of that Frenchman who met\n\"le bon et agréable Tristram,” and his wife, at Montpellier, and who,\ncharacteristically sympathizing with the inconstant husband, declared\nthat his wife’s incessant pursuit of him made him pass “d’assez\nmauvais moments,” which he bore “with the patience of an angel.\"\nBut, on the whole, Mrs. Sterne’s conduct seems by her husband’s own\nadmissions to have been not wanting in dignity.",
        "As to the nature of Sterne’s love-affairs I have come, though not\nwithout hesitation, to the conclusion that they were most, if not all\nof them, what is called, somewhat absurdly, Platonic. In saying this,\nhowever, I am by no means prepared to assert that they would all of\nthem have passed muster before a prosaic and unsentimental British\njury as mere indiscretions, and nothing worse. Sterne’s relations\nwith Miss Fourmantelle, for instance, assumed at last a profoundly\ncompromising character, and it is far from improbable that the worst\nconstruction would have been put upon them by one of the plain-dealing\ntribunals aforesaid. Certainly a young woman who leaves her mother at\nYork, and comes up to London to reside alone in lodgings, where she is\nconstantly being visited by a lover who is himself living en garçonin the metropolis, can hardly complain if her imprudence is fatal to\nher reputation; neither can he if his own suffers in the same way.\nBut, as I am not of those who hold that the conventionally “innocent\"\nis the equivalent of the morally harmless in this matter, I cannot\nregard the question as worth any very minute investigation. I am\nnot sure that the habitual male flirt, who neglects his wife to sit\ncontinually languishing at the feet of some other woman, gives much\nless pain and scandal to others, or does much less mischief to himself\nand the objects of his adoration, than the thorough-going profligate;\nand I even feel tempted to risk the apparent paradox that, from\nthe artistic point of view, Sterne lost rather than gained by the\ngenerally Platonic character of his amours. For, as it was, the\nrestraint of one instinct of his nature implied the over-indulgence\nof another which stood in at least as much need of chastenment. If his\nlove-affairs stopped short of the gratification of the senses, they\ninvolved a perpetual fondling and caressing of those effeminate\nsensibilities of his into that condition of hyper-aesthesia which,\nthough Sterne regarded it as the strength, was in reality the\nweakness, of his art.",
        "Injurious, however, as was the effect which Sterne’s philanderings\nexercised upon his personal and literary character, it is not likely\nthat, at least at this period of his life at Sutton, they had in any\ndegree compromised his reputation. For this he had provided in\nother ways, and principally by his exceedingly injudicious choice\nof associates. “As to the squire of the parish,” he remarks in the\nMemoir, “I cannot say we were on a very friendly footing, but at\nStillington the family of the C[rofts] showed us every kindness: ’twas\nmost agreeable to be within a mile and a half of an amiable family who\nwere ever cordial friends;” and who, it may be added, appear to have\nbeen Sterne’s only reputable acquaintances. For the satisfaction of\nall other social needs he seems to have resorted to a companionship\nwhich it was hardly possible for a clergyman to frequent without\nscandal–that, namely, of John Hall Stevenson and the kindred spirits\nwhom he delighted to collect around him at Skelton–familiarly known\nas “Crazy” Castle. The club of the “Demoniacs,” of which Sterne makes\nmention in his letters, may have had nothing very diabolical about it\nexcept the name; but, headed as it was by the suspected ex-comrade\nof Wilkes and his brother monks of Medmenham, and recruited by gay\nmilitaires like Colonels Hall and Lee, and “fast” parsons like the\nRev. “Panty” Lascelles (mock godson of Pantagruel), it was certainly\na society in which the Vicar of Sutton could not expect to enroll\nhimself without offence. We may fairly suppose, therefore, that it\nwas to his association with these somewhat too “jolly companions” that\nSterne owed that disfavour among decorous country circles, of which\nhe shows resentful consciousness in the earlier chapters of Tristram\nShandy.\nBut before we finally cross the line which separates the life of the\nobscure country parson from the life of the famous author, a word or\ntwo must be said of that piece of writing which was alluded to a few\npages back as the only known exception to the generally “professional\"\ncharacter of all Sterne’s compositions of the pre-Shandian era. This\nwas a piece in the allegoric-satirical style, which, though not very\nremarkable in itself, may not improbably have helped to determine its\nauthor’s thoughts in the direction of more elaborate literary efforts.\nIn the year 1758 a dispute had arisen between a certain Dr. Topham, an\necclesiastical lawyer in large local practice, and Dr. Fountayne, the\nthen Dean of York. This dispute had originated in an attempt on the\npart of the learned civilian, who appears to have been a pluralist of\nan exceptionally insatiable order, to obtain the reversion of one of\nhis numerous offices for his son, alleging a promise made to him on\nthat behalf by the Archbishop. This promise–which had, in fact, been\ngiven–was legally impossible of performance, and upon the failure\nof his attempt the disappointed Topham turned upon the Dean, and\nmaintained that by him, at any rate, he had been promised another\nplace of the value of five guineas per annum, and appropriately known\nas the “Commissaryship of Pickering and Pocklington.” This the Dean\ndenied, and thereupon Dr. Topham fired off a pamphlet setting forth\nthe circumstances of the alleged promise, and protesting against the\nwrong inflicted upon him by its non-performance. At this point Sterne\ncame to Dr. Fountayne’s assistance with a sarcastic apologue entitled\nthe “History of a good Warm Watchcoat,” which had “hung up many years\nin the parish vestry,” and showing how this garment had so excited\nthe cupidity of Trim, the sexton, that “nothing would serve him but\nhe must take it home, to have it converted into a warm under-petticoat\nfor his wife and a jerkin for himself against the winter.” The\nsymbolization of Dr. Topham’s snug “patent place,” which he wished\nto make hereditary, under the image of the good warm watchcoat, is of\ncourse plain enough; and there is some humour in the way in which the\nparson (the Archbishop) discovers that his incautious assent to Trim’s\nrequest had been given ultra vires. Looking through the parish\nregister, at the request of a labourer who wished to ascertain his\nage, the parson finds express words of bequest leaving the watch-coat\n\"for the sole use of the sextons of the church for ever, to be worn by\nthem respectively on winterly cold nights,” and at the moment when he\nis exclaiming, “Just Heaven! what an escape have I had! Give this\nfor a petticoat to Trim’s wife!” he is interrupted by Trim himself\nentering the vestry with “the coat actually ript and cut out” ready\nfor conversion into a petticoat for his wife. And we get a foretaste\nof the familiar Shandian impertinence in the remark which follows,\nthat “there are many good similes subsisting in the world, but which I\nhave neither time to recollect nor look for,” which would give you an\nidea of the parson’s astonishment at Trim’s impudence. The emoluments\nof “Pickering and Pocklington” appear under the figure of a “pair of\nblack velvet plush breeches” which ultimately “got into the possession\nof one Lorry Slim (Sterne himself, of course), an unlucky wight, by\nwhom they are still worn: in truth, as you will guess, they are very\nthin by this time.”",
        "The whole thing is the very slightest of “skits;” and the quarrel\nhaving been accommodated before it could be published, it was\nnot given to the world until after its author’s death. But it is\ninteresting, as his first known attempt in this line of composition,\nand the grasping sexton deserves remembrance, if only as having handed\ndown his name to a far more famous descendant.",
        "(1759-1760.)",
        "Hitherto we have had to construct our conception of Sterne out of\nmaterials of more or less plausible conjecture. We are now at last\napproaching the region of positive evidence, and henceforward, down\nalmost to the last scene of all, Sterne’s doings will be chronicled,\nand his character revealed, by one who happens, in this case, to be\nthe best of all possible biographers–the man himself. Not that such\nrecords are by any means always the most trustworthy of evidence.\nThere are some men whose real character is never more effectually\nconcealed than in their correspondence. But it is not so with Sterne.\nThe careless, slipshod letters which Madame de Medalle “pitchforked\"\ninto the book-market, rather than edited, are highly valuable as\npieces of autobiography. They are easy, naïve, and natural, rich in\nsimple self-disclosure in almost every page; and if they have more\nto tell us about the man than the writer, they are yet not wanting\nin instructive hints as to Sterne’s methods of composition and his\ntheories of art.",
        "It was in the year 1759 that the Vicar of Sutton and Prebendary of\nYork–already, no doubt, a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence\nto many worthy people in the county–conceived the idea of astonishing\nand scandalizing them still further after a new and original fashion.\nHis impulses to literary production were probably various, and not all\nof them, or perhaps the strongest of them, of the artistic order. The\nfirst and most urgent was, it may be suspected, the simplest and most\ncommon of all such motive forces. Sterne, in all likelihood, was in\nwant of money. He was not, perhaps, under the actual instruction of\nthat magister artium whom the Roman satirist has celebrated; for he\ndeclared, indeed, afterwards, that “he wrote not to be fed, but to be\nfamous.” But the context of the passage shows that he only meant to\ndeny any absolute compulsion to write for mere subsistence. Between\nthis sort of constraint and that gentler form of pressure which arises\nfrom the wish to increase an income sufficient for one’s needs, but\ninadequate to one’s desires, there is a considerable difference; and\nto repudiate the one is not to disclaim the other. It is, at any\nrate, certain that Sterne engaged at one time of his life in a rather\nspeculative sort of farming, and we have it from himself in a passage\nin one of his letters, which may be jest, but reads more like\nearnest, that it was his losses in this business that first turned his\nattention to literature.[1] His thoughts once set in that direction,\nhis peculiar choice of subject and method of treatment are easily\ncomprehensible. Pantagruelic burlesque came to him, if not naturally,\nat any rate by “second nature.” He had a strong and sedulously\ncultivated taste for Rabelaisian humour; his head was crammed with all\nsorts of out-of-the-way learning constantly tickling his comic sense\nby its very uselessness; he relished more keenly than any man the\nsolemn futilities of mediaeval doctors, and the pedantic indecencies\nof casuist fathers; and, along with all these temptations to an\nenterprise of the kind upon which he entered, he had been experiencing\na steady relaxation of deterrent restraints. He had fallen out with\nhis uncle some years since,[2] and the quarrel had freed him from at\nleast one influence making for clerical propriety of behaviour. His\nincorrigible levities had probably lost him the countenance of most of\nhis more serious acquaintances; his satirical humour had as probably\ngained him personal enemies not a few, and it may be that he had\ngradually contracted something of that “naughty-boy” temper, as we\nmay call it, for which the deliberate and ostentatious repetition of\noffences has an inexplicable charm. It seems clear, too, that, growth\nfor growth with this spirit of bravado, there had sprung up–in\nsomewhat incongruous companionship, perhaps–a certain sense of wrong.\nAlong with the impulse to give an additional shock to the prejudices\nhe had already offended, Sterne felt impelled to vindicate what he\nconsidered the genuine moral worth underlying the indiscretions of the\noffender. What, then, could better suit him than to compose a novel\nin which he might give full play to his simious humour, startle more\nhideously than ever his straighter-laced neighbours, defiantly defend\nhis own character, and caricature whatever eccentric figure in the\nsociety around him might offer the most tempting butt for ridicule?",
        "[Footnote 1: “I was once such a puppy myself,” he writes to a certain\nbaronet whom he is attempting to discourage from speculative farming\nof this sort, “and had my labour for my pains and two hundred pounds\nout of pocket. Curse on farming! (I said). Let us see if the pen will\nnot succeed better than the spade.\"]",
        "[Footnote 2: He himself, indeed, makes a particular point of this in\nexplaining his literary venture. “Now for your desire,” he writes to\na correspondent in 1759, “of knowing the reason of my turning author?\nwhy, truly I am tired of employing my brains for other people’s\nadvantage. ’Tis a foolish sacrifice I have made for some years for an\nungrateful person.\"–Letters, i. 82.]",
        "All the world knows how far he ultimately advanced beyond the\nsimplicity of the conception, and into what far higher regions of art\nits execution led him. But I find no convincing reason for believing\nthat Tristram Shandy had at the outset any more seriously artistic\npurpose than this; and much indirect evidence that this, in fact, it\nwas.",
        "The humorous figure of Mr. Shandy is, of course, the Cervantic centre\nof the whole; and it was out of him and his crotchets that Sterne,\nno doubt, intended from the first to draw the materials of that often\nunsavoury fun which was to amuse the light-minded and scandalize the\ndemure. But it can hardly escape notice that the two most elaborate\nportraits in Vol. I.–the admirable but very flatteringly idealized\nsketch of the author himself in Yorick, and the Gilrayesque caricature\nof Dr. Slop–are drawn with a distinctly polemical purpose, defensive\nin the former case and offensive in the latter. On the other hand,\nwith the disappearance of Dr. Slop caricature of living persons\ndisappears also; while, after the famous description of Yorick’s\ndeath-bed, we meet with no more attempts at self-vindication. It\nseems probable, therefore, that long before the first two volumes\nwere completed Sterne had discovered the artistic possibilities of\n\"My Uncle Toby” and “Corporal Trim,” and had realized the full\npotentialities of humour contained in the contrast between the\ntwo brothers Shandy. The very work of sharpening and deepening the\noutlines of this humorous antithesis, while it made the crack-brained\nphilosopher more and more of a burlesque unreality, continually added\nnew touches of life and nature to the lineaments of the simple-minded\nsoldier; and it was by this curious and half-accidental process that\nthere came to be added to the gallery of English fiction one of the\nmost perfect and delightful portraits that it possesses.",
        "We know from internal evidence that Tristram Shandy was begun in the\nearly days of 1759; and the first two volumes were probably completed\nby about the middle of the year. “In the year 1760,” writes Sterne, “I\nwent up to London to publish my two first volumes of Shandy.” And it\nis stated in a note to this passage, as cited in Scott’s memoir, that\nthe first edition was published “the year before” in York. There is,\nhowever, no direct proof that it was in the hands of the public before\nthe beginning of 1760, though it is possible that the date of its\npublication may just have fallen within the year. But, at all\nevents, on the 1st of January, 1760, an advertisement in the Public\nAdvertiser informed the world that “this day” was “published, printed\non superfine writing-paper, &c., The Life and Opinions of Tristram\nShandy. York. Printed for and sold by John Hinxham, Bookseller in\nStonegate.” The great London publisher, Dodslecy, to whom the book\nhad been offered, and who had declined the venture, figures in the\nadvertisement as the principal London bookseller from whom it was\nto be obtained. It seems that only a few copies were in the first\ninstance sent up to the London market; but they fell into good hands,\nfor there is evidence that Tristram Shandy had attracted the notice\nof at least one competent critic in the capital before the month of\nJanuary was out. But though the metropolitan success of the book\nwas destined to be delayed for still a month or two, in York it had\nalready created a furore in more senses than one. For, in fact,\nand no wonder, it had in many quarters given the deepest offence. Its\nRabelaisian license of incident and allusion was calculated to offend\nthe proprieties–the provincial proprieties especially–even in that\nfree-spoken age; and there was that in the book, moreover, which a\nprovincial society may be counted on to abominate, with a keener\nif less disinterested abhorrence than any sins against decency. It\ncontained, or was supposed to contain, a broadly ludicrous caricature\nof one well-known local physician; and an allusion, brief, indeed, and\ncovert, but highly scandalous, to a certain “droll foible” attributed\nto another personage of much wider celebrity in the scientific\nworld. The victim in the latter case was no longer living; and this\ncircumstance brought upon Sterne a remonstrance from a correspondent,\nto which he replied in a letter so characteristic in many respects as\nto be worth quoting. His correspondent was a Dr. * * * * * (asterisks\nfor which it is now impossible to substitute letters); and the burden\nof what seem to have been several communications in speech and writing\non the subject was the maxim, “De mortuis nil nisi bonum.” With such\nseriousness and severity had his correspondent dwelt upon this adage,\nthat “at length,” writes Sterne, “you have made me as serious and as\nsevere as yourself; but, that the humours you have stirred up might\nnot work too potently within me, I have waited four days to cool\nmyself before I could set pen to paper to answer you.” And thus he\nsets forth the results of his four days’ deliberation:",
        "“’De mortuis nil nisi bonum.’ I declare I have considered the wisdom\nand foundation of it over and over again as dispassionately and\ncharitably as a good Christian can, and, after all, I can find nothing\nin it, or make more of it than a nonsensical lullaby of some nurse,\nput into Latin by some pedant, to be chanted by some hypocrite to the\nend of the world for the consolation of departing lechers. ’Tis, I\nown, Latin, and I think that is all the weight it has, for, in plain\nEnglish, ’tis a loose and futile position below a dispute. ’You are\nnot to speak anything of the dead but what is good.’ Why so? Who\nsays so? Neither reason nor Scripture. Inspired authors have done\notherwise, and reason and common sense tell me that, if the characters\nof past ages and men are to be drawn at all, they are to be drawn like\nthemselves, that is, with their excellences and their foibles; and it\nas much a piece of justice to the world, and to virtue, too, to do the\none as the other. The ruling passion, et les égarements du coeur,\nare the very things which mark and distinguish a man’s character,\nin which I would as soon leave out a man’s head as his hobby-horse.\nHowever, if, like the poor devil of a painter, we must conform to the\npious canon, ’De mortuis,’ &c., which I own has a spice of piety in\nthe sound of it, and be obliged to paint both our angels and our\ndevils out of the same pot, I then infer that our Sydenhams and our\nSangrados, our Lucretias and our Messalinas, our Somersets and our\nBolingbrokes, are alike entitled to statues, and all the historians or\nsatirists who have said otherwise since they departed this life,\nfrom Sallust to S––e, are guilty of the crimes you charge me with,\n’cowardice and injustice.’ But why cowardice? ’Because ’tis not\ncourage to attack a dead man who can’t defend himself.’ But why do you\ndoctors attack such a one with your incision knife? Oh! for the good\nof the living. ’Tis my plea.”",
        "And, having given this humorous twist to his argument, he glides off\ninto extenuatory matter. He had not even, he protests, made as much as\na surgical incision into his victim (Dr. Richard Mead, the friend of\nBentley and of Newton, and a physician and physiologist of high repute\nin his day); he had but just scratched him, and that scarce skin-deep.\nAs to the “droll foible” of Dr. Mead, which he had made merry with,\n\"it was not first reported (even to the few who can understand the\nhint) by me, but known before by every chambermaid and footman within\nthe bills of mortality\"–a somewhat daring assertion, one would\nimagine, considering what the droll foible was; and Dr. Mead,\ncontinues Sterne, great man as he was, had, after all, not fared worse\nthan “a man of twice his wisdom\"–to wit Solomon, of whom the same\nremark had been made, that “they were both great men, and, like all\nmortal men, had each their ruling passion.”",
        "The mixture of banter and sound reasoning in this reply is, no doubt,\nvery skilful. But, unfortunately, neither the reasoning nor the\nbanter happens to meet the case of this particular defiance of the\n\"De mortuis” maxim, and as a serious defence against a serious charge\n(which was what the occasion required) Sterne’s answer is altogether\nfutile. For the plea of “the good of the living,” upon which, after\nall, the whole defence, considered seriously, rests, was quite\ninapplicable as an excuse for the incriminated passage. The only\nliving persons who could possibly be affected by it, for good or\nevil, were those surviving friends of the dead man, to whom Sterne’s\nallusion to what he called Dr. Mead’s “droll foible” was calculated to\ncause the deepest pain and shame.",
        "The other matter of offence to Sterne’s Yorkshire readers was of a\nmuch more elaborate kind. In the person of Dr. Slop, the grotesque\nman-midwife, who was to have assisted, but missed assisting, at\nTristram’s entry into the world, the good people of York were not slow\nto recognize the physical peculiarities and professional antecedents\nof Dr. Burton, the local accoucheur, whom Archdeacon Sterne had\narrested as a Jacobite. That the portrait was faithful to anything\nbut the external traits of the original, or was intended to reproduce\nanything more than these, Sterne afterwards denied; and we have\ncertainly no ground for thinking that Burton had invited ridicule on\nany other than the somewhat unworthy ground of the curious ugliness\nof his face and figure. It is most unlikely that his success as a\npractitioner in a branch of the medical art in which imposture is the\nmost easily detected, could have been earned by mere quackery; and\nhe seems, moreover, to have been a man of learning in more kinds than\none. The probability is that the worst that could be alleged against\nhim was a tendency to scientific pedantry in his published\nwritings, which was pretty sure to tickle the fancy of Mr. Sterne.\nUnscrupulously, however, as he was caricatured, the sensation which\nappears to have been excited in the county by the burlesque portrait\ncould hardly have been due to any strong public sympathy with the\ninvoluntary sitter. Dr. Burton seems, as a suspected Jacobite, to have\nbeen no special favourite with the Yorkshire squirearchy in general,\nbut rather the reverse thereof. Ucalegon, however, does not need to be\npopular to arouse his neighbour’s interest in his misfortunes; and the\ncaricature of Burton was doubtless resented on the proximus ardetprinciple by many who feared that their turn was coming next.",
        "To all the complaints and protests which reached him on the subject\nSterne would in any case, probably, have been indifferent; but he was\nsoon to receive encouragement which would have more than repaid a\nman of his temper for twice the number of rebukes. For London cared\nnothing for Yorkshire susceptibilities and Yorkshire fears. Provincial\nnotables might be libelled, and their friends might go in fear\nof similar treatment, but all that was nothing to “the town,” and\nTristram Shandy had taken the town by storm. We gather from a\npassage in the letter above quoted that as early as January 30\nthe book had “gained the very favourable opinion” of Mr. Garrick,\nafterwards to become the author’s intimate friend; and it is certain\nthat by the time of Sterne’s arrival in London, in March, 1760,\nTristram Shandy had become the rage.",
        "To say of this extraordinary work that it defies analysis would be the\nmerest inadequacy of commonplace. It was meant to defy analysis; it\nis of the very essence of its scheme and purpose that it should do so;\nand the mere attempt to subject it systematically to any such process\nwould argue an altogether mistaken conception of the author’s intent.\nIts full “official\" style and title is The Life and Opinions of\nTristram Shandy, Gent., and it is difficult to say which it contains\nthe less about–the opinions of Tristram Shandy or the events of\nhis life. As a matter of fact, its proper description would be “The\nOpinions of Tristram Shandy’s Father, with some Passages from the Life\nof his Uncle.” Its claim to be regarded as a biography of its nominal\nhero is best illustrated by the fact that Tristram is not born till\nthe third volume, and not breeched till the sixth; that it is not till\nthe seventh that he begins to play any active part in the narrative,\nappearing then only as a completely colourless and unindividualized\nfigure, a mere vehicle for the conveyance of Sterne’s own Continental\nimpressions de voyage; and that in the last two volumes, which\nare entirely taken up with the incident of his uncle’s courtship, he\ndisappears from the story altogether. It is to be presumed, perhaps,\nthough not very confidently, that the reader would have seen more\nof him if the tale had been continued; but how much or how little\nis quite uncertain. The real hero of the book is at the outset Mr.\nShandy, senior, who is, later on, succeeded in this place of dignity\nby my Uncle Toby. It not only served Sterne’s purpose to confine\nhimself mainly to these two characters, as the best whereon to display\nhis powers, but it was part of his studied eccentricity to do so. It\nwas a “point” to give as little as possible about Tristram Shandy in\na life of Tristram Shandy; just as it was a point to keep the reader\nwaiting throughout the year 1760 for their hero to be so much as born.\nIn the first volume, therefore, the author does literally everything\nbut make the slightest progress with his story. Starting off abruptly\nwith a mock physiologic disquisition upon the importance of a\nproper ordering of their mental states on the part of the intending\nprogenitors of children, he philosophizes gravely on this theme for\ntwo or three chapters; and then wanders away into an account of the\nlocal midwife, upon whose sole services Mrs. Shandy, in opposition\nto her husband, was inclined to rely. From the midwife it is an easy\ntransition to her patron and protector, the incumbent of the parish,\nand this, in its turn, suggests a long excursus on the character,\nhabits, appearance, home, friends, enemies, and finally death, burial,\nand epitaph of the Rev. Mr. Yorick. Thence we return to Mr. and Mrs.\nShandy, and are made acquainted, in absurdly minute detail, with an\nagreement entered into between them with reference to the place of\nsojourn to be selected for the lady’s accouchement, the burlesque\ndeed which records this compact being actually set out at full length.\nThence, again, we are beckoned away by the jester to join him in\nelaborate and not very edifying ridicule of the Catholic doctrine\nof ante-natal baptism; and thence–but it would be useless to follow\nfurther the windings and doublings of this literary hare.",
        "Yet though the book, as one thus summarizes it, may appear a mere\nfarrago of digressions, it nevertheless, after its peculiar fashion,\nadvances. Such definite purpose as underlies the tricks and grimaces\nof its author is by degrees accomplished; and before we reach the end\nof the first volume the highly humorous, if extravagantly idealized,\nfigure of Mr. Shandy takes bodily shape and consistency before our\neyes. It is a mistake, I think, of Sir Walter Scott’s to regard the\nportrait of this eccentric philosopher as intended for a satire upon\nperverted and deranged erudition–as the study of a man “whom too much\nand too miscellaneous learning had brought within a step or two of\nmadness.” Sterne’s conception seems to me a little more subtle and\nless commonplace than that. Mr. Shandy, I imagine, is designed to\npersonify not “crack-brained learning” so much as “theory run mad.” He\nis possessed by a sort of Demon of the Deductive, ever impelling him\nto push his premises to new conclusions without ever allowing him time\nto compare them with the facts. No doubt we are meant to regard him as\na learned man; but his son gives us to understand distinctly and very\nearly in the book that his crotchets were by no means those of a weak\nreceptive mind, overladen with more knowledge than it could digest,\nbut rather those of an over-active intelligence, far more deeply and\nconstantly concerned with its own processes than with the thoughts\nof others. Tristram, indeed, dwells pointedly on the fact that his\nfather’s dialectical skill was not the result of training, and that he\nowed nothing to the logic of the schools. “He was certainly,” says his\nson, “irresistible both in his orations and disputations,” but\nthat was because “he was born an orator ([Greek: Theodidaktos]).\nPersuasion hung upon his lips, and the elements of logic and rhetoric\nwere so blended in him, and withal he had so shrewd a guess at the\nweaknesses and passions of his respondent, that Nature might have\nstood up and said, ’This man is eloquent.’ And yet,” continues the\nfilial panegyric,",
        "  “He had never read Cicero nor Quintilian de Oratore, nor Aristotle,\n  nor Longinus among the ancients, nor Vossius, nor Skioppius, nor\n  Ramus, nor Farnaby among the moderns: and what is more astonishing\n  he had never in his whole life the least light or spark of subtilty\n  struck into his mind by one single lecture upon Crackenthorpe or\n  Burgersdicius or any Dutch commentator: he knew not so much as\n  in what the difference of an argument ad ignorantiam and an argument\n  ad hominem consisted; and when he went up along with me to\n  enter my name at Jesus College, in * * * *, it was a matter of just\n  wonder with my worthy tutor and two or three Fellows of that learned\n  society that a man who knew not so much as the names of his tools\n  should be able to work after that fashion with them.”",
        "Surely we all know men of this kind, and the\nconsternation–comparable only to that of M. Jourdain under the\nimpromptu carte-and-tierce of his servant-maid–which their sturdy\nif informal dialectic will often spread among many kinds of “learned\nsocieties.” But such men are certainly not of the class which Scott\nsupposed to have been ridiculed in the character of Walter Shandy.",
        "Among the crotchets of this born dialectician was a theory as to the\nimportance of Christian names in determining the future behaviour\nand destiny of the children to whom they are given; and, whatever\nadmixture of jest there might have been in some of his other fancies,\nin this his son affirms he was absolutely serious. He solemnly\nmaintained the opinion “that there was a strange kind of magic bias\nwhich good or bad names, as he called them, irresistibly impressed\nupon our character and conduct.” How many Caesars and Pompeys, he\nwould say, by mere inspiration of their names have been rendered\nworthy of them! And how many, he would add, are there who might have\ndone exceeding well in the world had not their characters and spirits\nbeen totally depressed and Nicodemus’d into nothing! He was astonished\nat parents failing to perceive that “when once a vile name was\nwrongfully or injudiciously given, ’twas not like a case of a man’s\ncharacter, which, when wronged, might afterwards be cleared; and\npossibly some time or other, if not in the man’s life, at least after\nhis death, be somehow or other set to rights with the world.” This\nname-giving injury, he would say, “could never be undone; nay, he\ndoubted whether an Act of Parliament could reach it; he knew, as well\nas you, that the Legislature assumed a power over surnames; but for\nvery strong reasons, which he could give, it had never yet adventured,\nhe would say, to go a step further.”",
        "With all this extravagance, however, there was combined an admirable\naffectation of sobriety. Mr. Shandy would have us believe that he\nwas no blind slave to his theory. He was quite willing to admit the\nexistence of names which could not affect the character either\nfor good or evil–Jack, Dick, and Tom, for instance; and such the\nphilosopher styled “neutral names,” affirming of them, “without a\nsatire, that there had been as many knaves and fools at least as wise\nand good men since the world began, who had indifferently borne them,\nso that, like equal forces acting against each other in contrary\ndirections, he thought they mutually destroyed each other’s\neffects; for which reason he would often declare he would not give a\ncherry-stone to choose among them. Bob, which was my brother’s name,\nwas another of these neutral kinds of Christian names which operated\nvery little either way; and as my father happened to be at Epsom when\nit was given him, he would ofttimes thank Heaven it was no worse.\"\nForewarned of this peculiarity of Mr.",
        "Shandy’s, the reader is, of course, prepared to hear that of all\nthe names in the universe the philosopher had the most unconquerable\naversion for Tristram, “the lowest and most contemptible opinion of it\nof anything in the world.” He would break off in the midst of one\nof his frequent disputes on the subject of names, and “in a spirited\nepiphonema, or rather erotesis,” demand of his antagonist “whether he\nwould take upon him to say he had ever remembered, whether he had\never read, or whether he had ever heard tell of a man called Tristram\nperforming anything great or worth recording. No, he would say.\nTristram! the thing is impossible.” It only remained that he should\nhave published a book in defence of the belief, and sure enough “in\nthe year sixteen,” two years before the birth of his second son, “he\nwas at the pains of writing an express dissertation simply upon the\nword Tristram, showing the world with great candour and modesty the\ngrounds of his great abhorrence to the name.” And with this idea\nSterne continues to amuse himself at intervals till the end of the\nchapter.",
        "That he does not so persistently amuse the reader it is, of course,\nscarcely necessary to say. The jest has not substance enough–few of\nSterne’s jests have–to stand the process of continual attrition to\nwhich he subjects it. But the mere historic gravity with which the\nvarious turns of this monomania are recorded–to say nothing of the\nseldom failing charm of the easy, gossiping style–prevents the thing\nfrom ever becoming utterly tiresome. On the whole, however, one begins\nto grow impatient for more of the same sort as the three admirable\nchapters on the Rev. Mr. Yorick, and is not sorry to get to the\nopening of the second volume, with its half-tender, half-humorous, and\nwholly delightful account of Uncle Toby’s difficulties in describing\nthe siege operations before Namur, and of the happy chance by which\nthese difficulties made him ultimately the fortunate possessor of a\n\"hobby.”",
        "Throughout this volume there are manifest signs of Sterne’s unceasing\ninterest in his own creations, and of his increasing consciousness of\ncreative power. Captain Toby Shandy is but just lightly sketched-in\nthe first volume, while Corporal Trim has not made his appearance on\nthe scene at all; but before the end of the second we know both of\nthem thoroughly, within and without. Indeed, one might almost say\nthat in the first half-dozen chapters which so excellently recount\nthe origin of the corporal’s fortification scheme, and the wounded\nofficer’s delighted acceptance of it, every trait in the simple\ncharacters–alike yet so different in their simplicity–of master and\nof man becomes definitely fixed in the reader’s mind. And the total\ndifference between the second and the first volume in point of\nfulness, variety, and colour is most marked. The artist, the inventor,\nthe master of dialogue, the comic dramatist, in fact, as distinct from\nthe humorous essayist, would almost seem to have started into being\nas we pass from the one volume to the other. There is nothing in the\ndrolleries of the first volume–in the broad jests upon Mr. Shandy’s\ncrotchets, or even in the subtler humour of the intellectual collision\nbetween these crotchets and his brother’s plain sense–to indicate the\nkind of power displayed in that remarkable colloquy à quatre, which\nbegins with the arrival of Dr. Slop and ends with Corporal Trim’s\nrecital of the Sermon on Conscience. Wit, humour, irony, quaint\nlearning, shrewd judgment of men and things, of these Sterne had\ndisplayed abundance already; but it is not in the earlier but in the\nlater half of the first instalment of Tristram Shandy that we first\nbecome conscious that he is something more than the possessor of all\nthese things; that he is gifted with the genius of creation, and has\nsent forth new beings into that world of immortal shadows which to\nmany of us is more real than our own.",

        "Sterne alighted from the York mail, just as Byron “awoke one morning,\"\nto “find himself famous.” Seldom indeed has any lion so suddenly\ndiscovered been pursued so eagerly and by such a distinguished crowd\nof hunters. The chase was remarkable enough to have left a lasting\nimpression on the spectators; for it was several years after (in 1773)\nthat Dr. Johnson, by way of fortifying his very just remark that “any\nman who has a name or who has the power of pleasing will be generally\ninvited in London,” observed gruffly that “the man Sterne,” he was\ntold, “had had engagements for three months.” And truly it would\nappear from abundant evidence that “the man Sterne” gained such a\nsocial triumph as might well have turned a stronger head than his.\nWithin twenty-four hours after his arrival his lodgings in Pall Mall\nwere besieged by a crowd of fashionable visitors; and in a few weeks\nhe had probably made the acquaintance of “everybody who was anybody\"\nin the London society of that day.",
        "How thoroughly he relished the delights of celebrity is revealed, with\na simple vanity which almost disarms criticism, in many a passage\nof his correspondence. In one of his earliest letters to Miss\nFourmantelle we find him proudly relating to her how already he “was\nengaged to ten noblemen and men of fashion.” Of Garrick, who had\nwarmly welcomed the humourist whose merits he had been the first to\ndiscover, Sterne says that he had “promised him at dinner to numbers\nof great people.” Amongst these great people who sought him out for\nthemselves was that discerning patron of ability in every shape, Lord\nRockingham. In one of the many letters which Madame de Medalle flung\ndateless upon the world, but which from internal evidence we can\nassign to the early months of 1760, Sterne writes that he is about to\n\"set off with a grand retinue of Lord Rockingham’s (in whose suite I\nmove) for Windsor” to witness, it should seem, an installation of\na Knight of the Garter. It is in his letters to Miss Fourmantelle,\nhowever, that his almost boyish exultation at his London triumph\ndiscloses itself most frankly. “My rooms,” he writes, “are filling\nevery hour with great people of the first rank, who strive who shall\nmost honour me.” Never, he believes, had such homage been rendered to\nany man by devotees so distinguished. “The honours paid me were the\ngreatest that were ever known from the great.”",
        "The self-painted portrait is not, it must be confessed, altogether\nan attractive one. It is somewhat wanting in dignity, and its air of\nover-inflated complacency is at times slightly ridiculous. But we must\nnot judge Sterne in this matter by too severe a standard. He was by\nnature neither a dignified nor a self-contained man: he had a head\nparticularly unfitted to stand sudden elevation; and it must be\nallowed that few men’s power of resisting giddiness at previously\nunexplored altitudes was ever so severely tried. It was not only “the\ngreat” in the sense of the high in rank and social distinction by\nwhom he was courted; he was welcomed also by the eminent in genius and\nlearning; and it would be no very difficult task for him to flatter\nhimself that it was the latter form of recognition which, he really\nvalued most. Much, at any rate, in the way of undue elation may be\nforgiven to a country clergyman who suddenly found himself the centre\nof a court, which was regularly attended by statesmen, wits, and\nleaders of fashion, and with whom even bishops condescended to open\ngracious diplomatic communication. “Even all the bishops,” he writes,\n\"have sent their compliments;” and though this can hardly have been\ntrue of the whole Episcopal Bench, it is certain that Sterne received\nsomething more than a compliment from one bishop, who was a host in\nhimself. He was introduced by Garrick to Warburton, and received high\nencouragement from that formidable prelate.[1]",
        "[Footnote 1: It is admitted, moreover, in the correspondence with Miss\nFourmantelle that Sterne received something more substantial from the\nBishop, in the shape of a purse of gold; and this strange present gave\nrise to a scandal on which something will be said hereafter.]",
        "The year 1760, however, was to bring to Sterne more solid gains than\nthat of mere celebrity, or even than the somewhat precarious money\nprofits which depend on literary vogue. Only a few weeks after his\narrival in town he was presented by Lord Falconberg with the curacy of\nCoxwold, “a sweet retirement,” as he describes it, “in comparison of\nSutton,” at which he was in future to pass most of the time spent\nby him in Yorkshire. What obtained him this piece of preferment is\nunknown. It may be that Tristram Shandy drew the Yorkshire peer’s\nattention to the fact that there was a Yorkshireman of genius living\nwithin a few miles of a then vacant benefice in his lordship’s gift,\nand that this was enough for him. But Sterne himself says–in writing\na year or so afterwards to a lady of his acquaintance–\"I hope I have\nbeen of some service to his lordship, and he has sufficiently requited\nme;” and in the face of this plain assertion, confirmed as it is by\nthe fact that Lord Falconberg was on terms of friendly intimacy with\nthe Vicar of Coxwold at a much later date than this, we may dismiss\nidle tales about Sterne’s having “black-mailed” the patron out of a\npresentation to a benefice worth no more, after all, than some 70£ a\nyear net.",
        "There is somewhat more substance, however, in the scandal which got\nabroad with reference to a certain alleged transaction between Sterne\nand Warburton. Before Sterne had been many days in London, and while\nyet his person and doings were the natural subjects of the newest\ngossip, a story found its way into currency to the effect that the\nnew-made Bishop of Gloucester had found it advisable to protect\nhimself against the satiric humour of the author of the Tristram\nShandy by a substantial present of money. Coming to Garrick’s ears,\nit was repeated by him–whether seriously or in jest–to Sterne,\nfrom whom it evoked a curious letter, which in Madame de Medalle’s\ncollection has been studiously hidden away amongst the correspondence\nof seven years later. “’Twas for all the world,” he began, “like a cut\nacross my finger with a sharp pen-knife. I saw the blood–gave it a\nsuck, wrapt it up, and thought no more about it.... The story you told\nme of Tristram’s pretended tutor this morning\"–(the scandal was, that\nWarburton had been threatened with caricature in the next volume of\nthe novel, under the guise of the hero’s tutor)–\"this vile story, I\nsay, though I then saw both how and where it wounded, I felt little\nfrom it at first, or, to speak more honestly (though it ruins my\nsimile), I felt a great deal of pain from it, but affected an air,\nusual in such accidents, of feeling less than I had.” And he goes on\nto repudiate, it will be observed, not so much the moral offence of\ncorruption, in receiving money to spare Warburton, as the intellectual\nsolecism of selecting him for ridicule. “What the devil!” he\nexclaims, “is there no one learned blockhead throughout the schools\nof misapplied science in the Christian world to make a tutor of for\nmy Tristram–are we so run out of stock that there is no one\nlumber-headed, muddle-headed, mortar-headed, pudding-head chap amongst\nour doctors...but I must disable my judgment by choosing a Warburton?\"\nLater on, in a letter to his friend, Mr. Croft, at Stillington, whom\nthe scandal had reached through a “society journal” of the time, he\nasks whether people would suppose he would be “such a fool as to fall\nfoul of Dr. Warburton, my best friend, by representing him so weak a\nman; or by telling such a lie of him as his giving me a purse to buy\noff the tutorship of Tristram–or that I should be fool enough to own\nthat I had taken a purse for that purpose?” It will be remarked that\nSterne does not here deny having received a purse from Warburton,\nbut only his having received it by way of black-mail: and the most\nmysterious part of the affair is that Sterne did actually receive the\nstrange present of a “purse of gold” from Warburton (whom at that time\nhe did not know nor had ever seen); and that he admits as much in one\nof his letters to Miss Fourmantelle. “I had a purse of guineas given\nme yesterday by a Bishop,” he writes, triumphantly, but without\nvolunteering any explanation of this extraordinary gift. Sterne’s\nletter to Garrick was forwarded, it would seem, to Warburton; and the\nBishop thanks Garrick for having procured for him “the confutation of\nan impertinent story the first moment I heard of it.” This, however,\ncan hardly count for much. If Warburton had really wished Sterne to\nabstain from caricaturing him, he would be as anxious–and for much\nthe same reasons–to conceal the fact as to suppress the caricature.\nHe would naturally have the disclosure of it reported to Sterne\nfor formal contradiction, as in fulfilment of a virtual term in the\nbargain between them. The epithet of “irrevocable scoundrel,” which\nhe afterwards applied to Sterne, is of less importance, as proceeding\nfrom Warburton, than it would have been had it come from any one not\nhabitually employing Warburton’s peculiar vocabulary; but it at least\nargues no very cordial feeling on the Bishop’s side. And, on the\nwhole, one regrets to feel, as I must honestly confess that I do feel,\nfar less confident of the groundlessness of this rather unpleasant\nstory than could be wished. It is impossible to forget, however, that\nwhile the ethics of this matter were undoubtedly less strict in those\ndays than they are–or, at any rate, are recognized as being–in our\nown, there is nothing in Sterne’s character to make us suppose him to\nhave been at all in advance of the morality of his time.",
        "The incumbent-designate did not go down at once to take possession of\nhis temporalities. His London triumph had not yet run its course. The\nfirst edition of Vols. I. and II. of Tristram Shandy was exhausted\nin some three months. In April, Dodsley brought out a second; and,\nconcurrently with the advertisement of its issue, there appeared–in\nsomewhat incongruous companionship–the announcement, “Speedily will\nbe published, The Sermons of Mr. Yorick.” The judicious Dodsley, or\npossibly the judicious Sterne himself (acute enough in matters of\nthis kind), had perceived that now was the time to publish a series of\nsermons by the very unclerical lion of the day. There would–they,\nno doubt, thought–be an undeniable piquancy, a distinct flavour of\nsemi-scandalous incongruity in listening to the Word of Life from the\nlips of this loose-tongued droll; and the more staid and serious the\nsermon, the more effective the contrast. There need not have been\nmuch trouble in finding the kind of article required; and we may be\ntolerably sure that, even if Sterne did not perceive that fact for\nhimself, his publisher hastened to inform him that “anything would\ndo.” Two of his pulpit discourses, the Assize Sermon and the Charity\nSermon, had already been thought worthy of publication by their author\nin a separate form; and the latter of these found a place in the\nseries; while the rest seem to have been simply the chance sweepings\nof the parson’s sermon-drawer. The critics who find wit, eccentricity,\nflashes of Shandyism, and what not else of the same sort in these\ndiscourses, must be able–or so it seems to me–to discover these\nphenomena anywhere. To the best of my own judgment the Sermons\nare–with but few and partial exceptions–of the most commonplace\ncharacter; platitudinous with the platitudes of a thousand pulpits,\nand insipid with the crambe repetita of a hundred thousand homilies.\nA single extract will fully suffice for a specimen of Sterne’s\npre-Shandian homiletic style; his post-Shandian manner was very\ndifferent, as we shall see. The preacher is discoursing upon the\nwell-worn subject of the inconsistencies of human character:",
        "  “If such a contrast was only observable in the different stages of\n  a man’s life, it would cease to be either a matter of wonder or of\n  just reproach. Age, experience, and much reflection may naturally\n  enough be supposed to alter a man’s sense of things, and so entirely\n  to transform him that, not only in outward appearance but in the\n  very cast and turn of his mind, he may be as unlike and different\n  from the man he was twenty or thirty years ago as he ever was from\n  anything of his own species. This, I say, is naturally to be accounted\n  for, and in some cases might be praiseworthy too; but the observation\n  is to be made of men in the same period of their lives that in\n  the same day, sometimes on the very same action, they are utterly\n  inconsistent and irreconcilable with themselves. Look at the man in\n  one light, and he shall seem wise, penetrating, discreet, and brave;\n  behold him in another point of view, and you see a creature all over\n  folly and indiscretion, weak and timorous as cowardice and\n  indiscretion can make him. A man shall appear gentle, courteous,\n  and benevolent to all mankind; follow him into his own house,\n  maybe you see a tyrant morose and savage to all whose happiness\n  depends upon his kindness. A third, in his general behaviour,\n  is found to be generous, disinterested, humane, and friendly. Hear\n  but the sad story of the friendless orphans too credulously trusting\n  all their whole substance into his hands, and he shall appear more\n  sordid, more pitiless and unjust than the injured themselves have\n  bitterness to paint him. Another shall be charitable to the poor,\n  uncharitable in his censures and opinions of all the rest of the\n  world besides: temperate in his appetites, intemperate in his tongue;\n  shall have too much conscience and religion to cheat the man who\n  trusts him, and perhaps as far as the business of debtor and creditor\n  extends shall be just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite; yet in\n  matters of full or great concern, where he is to have the handling\n  of the party’s reputation and good name, the dearest, the tenderest\n  property the man has, he will do him irreparable damage, and rob him\n  there without measure or pity.\"–Sermon XI.–On Evil Speaking.",
        "There is clearly nothing particularly striking in all that, even\nconveyed as it is in Sterne’s effective, if loose and careless, style;\nand it is no unfair sample of the whole. The calculation, however, of\nthe author and his shrewd publisher was that, whatever the intrinsic\nmerits or demerits of these sermons, they would “take” on the strength\nof the author’s name; nor, it would seem, was their calculation\ndisappointed. The edition of this series of sermons now lying before\nme is numbered the sixth, and its date is 1764; which represents a\ndemand for a new edition every nine months or so, over a space of\nfour years. They may, perhaps, have succeeded, too, in partially\nreconciling a certain serious-minded portion of the public to the\nauthor. Sterne evidently hoped that they might; for we find him\nsending a copy to Warburton, in the month of June, immediately after\nthe publication of the book, and receiving in return a letter of\ncourteous thanks, and full of excellent advice as to the expediency\nof avoiding scandal by too hazardous a style of writing in the future.\nSterne, in reply, protests that he would “willingly give no offence to\nmortal by anything which could look like the least violation of either\ndecency or good manners;” but–and it is an important “but\"–he cannot\npromise to “mutilate everything” in Tristram “down to the prudish\nhumour of every particular” (individual), though he will do his best;\nbut, in any case, “laugh, my Lord, I will, and as loudly as I can.\"\nAnd laugh he did, and in such Rabelaisian fashion that the Bishop\n(somewhat inconsistently for a critic who had welcomed Sterne on\nthe appearance of the first two volumes expressly as the “English\nRabelais”) remarked of him afterwards with characteristic vigour, in\na letter to a friend, that he fears the fellow is an “irrevocable\nscoundrel.”",
        "The volumes, however, which earned “the fellow” this Episcopal\nbenediction were not given to the world till the next year. At the\nend of May or beginning of June, 1760, Sterne went to his new home\nat Coxwold, and his letters soon begin to show him to us at work upon\nfurther records of Mr. Shandy’s philosophical theory-spinning and the\nsimpler pursuits of his excellent brother. It is probable that this\nyear, 1760, was, on the whole, the happiest year of Sterne’s life.\nHis health, though always feeble, had not yet finally given way;\nand though the “vile cough” which was to bring him more than once to\ndeath’s door, and at last to force it open, was already troubling him,\nhe had that within him which made it easy to bear up against all\nsuch physical ills. His spirits, in fact, were at their highest. His\nworldly affairs were going at least as smoothly as they ever went.\nHe was basking in that sunshine of fame which was so delightful to a\ntemperament differing from that of the average Englishman, as does the\nphysique of the Southern races from that of the hardier children of\nthe North; and lastly, he was exulting in a new-born sense of creative\npower which no doubt made the composition of the earlier volumes of\nTristram a veritable labour of love.",
        "But the witty division of literary spinners into silkworms and\nspiders–those who spin because they are full, and those who do so\nbecause they are empty–is not exhaustive. There are human silk-worms\nwho become gradually transformed into spiders–men who begin writing\nin order to unburden a full imagination, and who, long after that\nprocess has been completely performed, continue writing in order to\nfill an empty belly; and though Sterne did not live long enough to\n\"write himself out,” there are certain indications that he would\nnot have left off writing if and when he felt that this stage of\nexhaustion had arrived. His artistic impulses were curiously combined\nwith a distinct admixture of the “potboiler” spirit; and it was with\nsomething of the complacency of an annuitant that he looked forward to\ngiving the public a couple of volumes of Tristram Shandy every year\nas long as they would stand it. In these early days, however, there\nwas no necessity even to discuss the probable period either of the\nwriter’s inspiration or of the reader’s appetite. At present the\npublic were as eager to consume more Shandyism as Sterne was ready to\nproduce it: the demand was as active as the supply was easy. By the\nend of the year Vols. III. and IV. were in the press, and on January\n27, 1761, they made their appearance. They had been disposed of in\nadvance to Dodsley for 380_l.–no bad terms of remuneration in\nthose days; but it is still likely enough that the publisher made\na profitable bargain. The new volumes sold freely, and the public\nlaughed at them as heartily as their two predecessors. Their author’s\nvogue in London, whither he went in December, 1760, to superintend\npublication, was as great during the next spring as it had been in\nthe last. The tide of visitors again set in all its former force and\nvolume towards the “genteel lodgings.” His dinner list was once more\nfull, and he was feasted and flattered by wits, beaux, courtiers,\npoliticians, and titled-lady lion-hunters as sedulously as ever. His\nletters, especially those to his friends the Crofts, of Stillington,\nabound, as before, in touches of the same amusing vanity. With how\ndelicious a sense of self-importance must he have written these words:\n\"You made me and my friends very merry with the accounts current at\nYork of my being forbad the Court, but they do not consider what a\nconsiderable person they make of me when they suppose either my going\nor not going there is a point that ever enters the K.’s head; and\nfor those about him, I have the honour either to stand so personally\nwell-known to them, or to be so well represented by those of the first\nrank, as to fear no accident of the kind.” Amusing, too, is it to note\nthe familiarity, as of an old habitué of Ministerial antechambers,\nwith which this country parson discusses the political changes of\nthat interesting year; though scarcely more amusing, perhaps, than the\nsolemnity with which his daughter disguises the identity of the new\nPremier under the title B––e; and by a similar use of initials\nattempts to conceal the momentous state secret that the D. of R. had\nbeen removed from the place of Groom of the Chambers, and that Sir\nF.D. had succeeded T. as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Occasionally,\nhowever, the interest of his letters changes from personal to public,\nand we get a glimpse of scenes and personages that have become\nhistorical. He was present in the House of Commons at the first grand\ndebate on the German war after the Great Commoner’s retirement from\noffice–\"the pitched battle,” as Sterne calls it, “wherein Mr. P.\nwas to have entered and thrown down the gauntlet” in defence of his\nmilitary policy. Thus he describes it:",
        "  “There never was so full a House–the gallery full to the top–I\n  was there all the day; when lo! a political fit of the gout seized the\n  great combatant–he entered not the lists. Beckford got up and\n  begged the House, as he saw not his right honourable friend there,\n  to put off the debate–it could not be done: so Beckford rose up\n  and made a most long, passionate, incoherent speech in defence of\n  the German war, but very severe upon the unfrugal manner it was\n  carried on, in which he addressed himself principally to the C[hancellor]\n  of the E[xchequer], and laid on him terribly.... Legge\n  answered Beckford very rationally and coolly. Lord K. spoke long.\n  Sir F. D[ashwood] maintained the German war was most pernicious....\n  Lord B[arrington] at last got up and spoke half an hour\n  with great plainness and temper, explained many hidden things relating\n  to these accounts in favour of the late K., and told two or\n  three conversations which had passed between the K. and himself\n  relative to these expenses, which cast great honour upon the K.’s\n  character. This was with regard to the money the K. had secretly\n  furnished out of his own pocket to lessen the account of the\n  Hanover-score brought us to discharge. Beckford and Barrington\n  abused all who fought for peace and joined in the cry for it,\n  and Beckford added that the reasons of wishing a peace now were\n  the same as at the Peace of Utrecht–that the people behind the\n  curtain could not both maintain the war and their places too, so\n  were for making another sacrifice of the nation to their own interests.\n  After all, the cry for a peace is so general that it will certainly\n  end in one.”",
        "And then the letter, recurring to personal matters towards the close,\nrecords the success of Vols. III. and IV.:",
        "“One half of the town abuse my book as bitterly as the other half cry\nit up to the skies–the best is they abuse and buy it, and at such a\nrate that we are going on with a second edition as fast as possible.\"\nThis was written only in the first week of March, so that the edition\nmust have been exhausted in little more than a month. It was, indeed,\nanother triumph; and all through this spring up to midsummer did\nSterne remain in London to enjoy it. But, with three distinct flocks\nawaiting a renewal of his pastoral ministrations in Yorkshire, it\nwould scarcely have done for him, even in those easy-going days of\nthe Establishment, to take up his permanent abode at the capital; and\nearly in July he returned to Coxwold.",
        "From the middle of this year, 1761, the scene begins to darken, and\nfrom the beginning of the next year onward Sterne’s life was little\nbetter than a truceless struggle with the disease to which he was\ndestined, prematurely, to succumb. The wretched constitution which,\nin common with his short-lived brothers and sisters, he had inherited\nprobably from his father, already began to show signs of breaking\nup. Invalid from the first, it had doubtless been weakened by the\nhardships of Sterne’s early years, and yet further, perhaps, by the\nexcitements and dissipations of his London life; nor was the change\nfrom the gaieties of the capital to hard literary labour in a country\nparsonage calculated to benefit him as much as it might others. Shandy\nHall, as he christened his pretty parsonage at Coxwold, and as the\nhouse, still standing, is called to this day, soon became irksome\nto him. The very reaction begotten of unwonted quietude acted on his\ntemperament with a dispiriting rather than a soothing effect. The\nchange from his full and stimulating life in London to the dull\nround of clerical duties in a Yorkshire village might well have been\ndepressing to a mind better balanced and ballasted than his. To him,\nwith his light, pleasure-loving nature, it was as the return of the\nschoolboy from pantomimes and pony-riding to the more sober delights\nof Dr. Swishtail’s; and, in a letter to Hall Stevenson, Sterne reveals\nhis feelings with all the juvenile frankness of one of the Doctor’s\npupils:",
        "  “I rejoice you are in London–rest you there in peace; here ’tis the\n  devil. You were a good prophet. I wish myself back again, as you\n  told me I should, but not because a thin, death-doing, pestiferous\n  north-east wind blows in a line directly from Crazy Castle turret\n  fresh upon me in this cuckoldly retreat (for I value the north-east\n  wind and all its powers not a straw), but the transition from rapid\n  motion to absolute rest was too violent. I should have walked about\n  the streets of York ten days, as a proper medium to have passed\n  through before I entered upon my rest; I stayed but a moment, and\n  I have been here but a few, to satisfy me. I have not managed my\n  miseries like a wise man, and if God for my consolation had not\n  poured forth the spirit of Shandyism unto me, which will not suffer\n  me to think two moments upon any grave subject, I would else just\n  now lay down and die.”",
        "It is true he adds, in the next sentence, that in half an hour’s time\n\"I’ll lay a guinea I shall be as merry as a monkey, and forget it\nall,” but such sudden revulsions of high spirits can hardly be allowed\nto count for much against the prevailing tone of discontented ennuiwhich pervades this letter.",
        "Apart, moreover, from Sterne’s regrets of London, his country home\nwas becoming from other causes a less pleasant place of abode. His\nrelations with his wife were getting less and less cordial every year.\nWith a perversity sometimes noticeable in the wives of distinguished\nmen, Mrs. Sterne had failed to accept with enthusiasm the rôleof distant and humbly admiring spectator of her brilliant husband’s\ntriumphs. Accept it, of course, she did, being unable, indeed, to help\nherself; but it is clear that when Sterne returned home after one of\nhis six months’ revels in the gaieties of London, his wife, who had\nbeen vegetating the while in the retirement of Yorkshire, was not in\nthe habit of welcoming him with effusion. Perceiving so clearly that\nher husband preferred the world’s society to hers, she naturally,\nperhaps, refused to disguise her preference of her own society to his.\nTheir estrangement, in short, had grown apace, and had already\nbrought them to that stage of mutual indifference which is at once so\ncomfortable and so hopeless–secure alike against the risk of “scenes\"\nand the hope of reconciliation, shut fast in its exemption from\namantium irae against all possibility of redintegratio amoris.To such perfection, indeed, had the feeling been cultivated on both\nsides, that Sterne, in the letter above quoted, can write of his\nconjugal relations in this philosophic strain:",
        "  “As to matrimony I should be a beast to rail at it, for my wife is\n  easy, but the world is not, and had I stayed from her a second longer\n  it would have been a burning shame–else she declares herself\n  happier without me. But not in anger is this declaration made (the\n  most fatal point, of course, about it), but in pure, sober, good sense,\n  built on sound experience. She hopes you will be able to strike a\n  bargain for me before this twelvemonth to lead a bear round Europe,\n  and from this hope from you I verily believe it is that you are\n  so high in her favour at present. She swears you are a fellow of wit,\n  though humorous;[2] a funny, jolly soul, though somewhat splenetic,\n  and (hating the love of women) as honest as gold. How do you\n  like the simile?”",
        "There is, perhaps, a touch of affected cynicism in the suggestion that\nMrs. Sterne’s liking for one of her husband’s friends was wholly based\nupon the expectation that he would rid her of her husband; but mutual\nindifference must, it is clear, have reached a pretty advanced stage\nbefore such a remark could, even half in jest, be possible. And with\none more longing, lingering look at the scenes which he had quitted\nfor a lot like that of the Duke of Buckingham’s dog, upon whom his\nmaster pronounced the maledictory wish that “he were married and lived\nin the country,” this characteristic letter concludes:",
        "  “Oh, Lord! now are you going to Ranelagh to-night, and I am sitting\n  sorrowful as the prophet was when the voice cried out to him\n  and said, ’What do’st thou here, Elijah?’ ’Tis well that the spirit\n  does not make the same at Coxwold, for unless for the few sheep\n  left me to take care of in the wilderness, I might as well, nay, better,\n  be at Mecca. When we find we can, by a shifting of places, run\n  away from ourselves, what think you of a jaunt there before we\n  finally pay a visit to the Vale of Jehoshaphat? As ill a fame as we\n  have, I trust I shall one day or other see you face to face, so tell the\n  two colonels if they love good company to live righteously and soberly,\n  as you do, and then they will have no doubts or dangers within\n  or without them. Present my best and warmest wishes to them,\n  and advise the eldest to prop up his spirits, and get a rich dowager\n  before the conclusion of the peace. Why will not the advice suit\n  both, par nobile fratrum?_”",
        "[Footnote 1: It is curious to note, as a point in the chronology of\nlanguage, how exclusive is Sterne’s employment of the words “humour,\"\n\"humourists,” in their older sense of “whimsicality,” “an eccentric.\"\nThe later change in its meaning gives to the word “though” in the\nabove passage an almost comic effect.]",
        "In conclusion, he tells his friend that the next morning, if Heaven\npermit, he begins the fifth volume of Shandy, and adds, defiantly,\nthat he “cares not a curse for the critics,” but “will load my vehicle\nwith what goods He sends me, and they may take ’em off my hands or let\n’em alone.”",
        "The allusions to foreign travel in this letter were made with,\nsomething more than a jesting intent. Sterne had already begun to be\nseriously alarmed, and not without reason, about the condition of his\nhealth. He shrank from facing another English winter, and meditated\na southward flight so soon as he should have finished his fifth\nand sixth volumes, and seen them safe in the printer’s hands. His\npublisher he had changed, for what reason is not known, and the firm\nof Becket & De Hondt had taken the place of Dodsley. Sterne hoped by\nthe end of the year to be free to depart from England, and already he\nhad made all arrangements with his ecclesiastical superiors for the\nnecessary leave of absence. He seems to have been treated with all\nconsideration in the matter. His Archbishop, on being applied to, at\nonce excused him from parochial work for a year, and promised, if\nit should be necessary, to double that term. Fortified with this\npermission, Sterne bade farewell to his wife and daughter, and betook\nhimself to London, with his now completed volumes, at the setting in\nof the winter. On the 21st of December they made their appearance, and\nin about three weeks from that date their author left England,\nwith the intention of wintering in the South of France. There were\ndifficulties, however, of more kinds than one which had first to be\nfaced–a pecuniary difficulty, which Garrick met by a loan of 20£.,\nand a political difficulty, for the removal of which Sterne had to\nemploy the good offices of new acquaintance later on. He reached Paris\nabout the 17th of January, 1762, and there met with a reception\nwhich interposed, as might have been expected, the most effectual of\nobstacles to his further progress southward. He was received in Paris\nwith open arms, and stepped at once within the charmed circle of the\nphilosophic salons. Again was the old intoxicating cup presented to\nhis lips–this time, too, with more dexterous than English hands–and\nagain did he drink deeply of it. “My head is turned,” he writes to\nGarrick, “with what I see, and the unexpected honour I have met with\nhere. Tristram was almost as much known here as in London, at least\namong your men of condition and learning, and has got me introduced\ninto so many circles (’tis comme à Londres_) I have just now a\nfortnight’s dinners and suppers on my hands.” We may venture to doubt\nwhether French politeness had not been in one respect taken somewhat\ntoo seriously by the flattered Englishman, and whether it was much\nmore than the name and general reputation of Tristram, which was\n\"almost as much known” in Paris as in London. The dinners and suppers,\nhowever, were, at any rate, no figures of speech, but very liberal\nentertainments, at which Sterne appears to have disported himself with\nall his usual unclerical abandon. “I Shandy it away,” he writes in\nhis boyish fashion to Garrick, “fifty times more than I was ever wont,\ntalk more nonsense than ever you heard me talk in all your days,\nand to all sorts of people. ’Qui le diable est cet homme-là?’ said\nChoiseul, t’other day, ’ce Chevalier Shandy?’” [We might be listening\nto one of Thackeray’s Irish heroes.] “You’ll think me as vain as a\ndevil was I to tell you the rest of the dialogue.” But there were\ndistinguished Frenchmen who were ready to render to the English author\nmore important services than that of offering him hospitality and\nflattery. Peace had not been formally concluded between France and\nEngland, and the passport with which Sterne had been graciously\nfurnished by Pitt was not of force enough to dispense him from making\nspecial application to the French Government for permission to remain\nin the country. In this request he was influentially backed. “My\napplication,” he writes, “to the Count de Choiseul goes on swimmingly,\nfor not only M. Pelletière (who by-the-bye sends ten thousand\ncivilities to you and Mrs. G.) has undertaken my affair, but the Count\nde Limbourg. The Baron d’Holbach has offered any security for the\ninoffensiveness of my behaviour in France–’tis more, you rogue! than\nyou will do.” And then the orthodox, or professedly orthodox, English\ndivine, goes on to describe the character and habits of his strange\nnew friend: “This Baron is one of the most learned noblemen here, the\ngreat protector of wits and of the savans who are no wits; keeps\nopen house three days a week–his house is now, as yours was to me, my\nown–he lives at great expense.” Equally communicative is he as to his\nother great acquaintances. Among these were the Count de Bissie, whom\nby an “odd incident” (as it seemed to his unsuspecting vanity) “I\nfound reading Tristram when I was introduced to him, which I was,\"\nhe adds (without perceiving the connexion between this fact and the\n\"incident”), “at his desire;” Mr. Fox and Mr. Macartney (afterwards\nthe Lord Macartney of Chinese celebrity), and the Duke of Orleans (not\nyet Égalité) himself, “who has suffered my portrait to be added to the\nnumber of some odd men in his collection, and has had it taken most\nexpressively at full length by a gentleman who lives with him.” Nor\nwas it only in the delights of society that Sterne was now revelling.\nHe was passionately fond of the theatre, and his letters to\nGarrick are full of eager criticism of the great French performers,\nintermingled with flatteries, sometimes rather full-bodied than\ndelicate, of their famous English rival. Of Clairon, in Iphigénie,\nhe says “she is extremely great. Would to God you had one or two\nlike her. What a luxury to see you with one of such power in the same\ninteresting scene! But ’tis too much.” Again he writes: “The French\ncomedy I seldom visit; they act scarce anything but tragedies; and the\nClairon is great, and Mdlle. Dumesmil in some parts still greater than\nher. Yet I cannot bear preaching–I fancy I got a surfeit of it in my\nyounger days.” And in a later letter:",
        "  “After a vile suspension of three weeks, we are beginning with\n  our comedies and operas. Yours I hear never flourished more; here\n  the comic actors were never so low; the tragedians hold up their\n  heads in all senses. I have known one little man support the theatrical\n  world like a David Atlas upon his shoulders, but Préville can’t\n  do half as much here, though Mad. Clairon stands by him and sets\n  her back to his. She is very great, however, and highly improved\n  since you saw her. She also supports her dignity at table, and has\n  her public day every Thursday, when she gives to eat (as they say\n  here) to all that are hungry and dry. You are much talked of here,\n  and much expected, as soon as the peace will let you. These two\n  last days you have happened to engross the whole conversation at\n  the great houses where I was at dinner. ’Tis the greatest problem\n  in nature in this meridian that one and the same man should possess\n  such tragic and comic powers, and in such an equilibrio as to divide\n  the world for which of the two Nature intended him.”",
        "And while on this subject of the stage let us pause for a moment\nto glance at an incident which connects Sterne with one of the most\nfamous of his French contemporaries. He has been asked “by a lady of\ntalent,” he tells Garrick, “to read a tragedy, and conjecture if it\nwould do for you. ’Tis from the plan of Diderot; and, possibly, half\na translation of it: The Natural Son, or the Triumph of Virtue,\nin five acts. It has too much sentiment in it (at least for me); the\nspeeches too long, and savour too much of preaching. This may be\na second reason it is not to my taste–’tis all love, love, love\nthroughout, without much separation in the characters. So I fear it\nwould not do for your stage, and perhaps for the very reason which\nrecommends it to a French one.” It is curious to see the “adaptator\ncerebrosuga” at work in those days as in these; though not, in this\ninstance, as it seems, with as successful results. The Natural Son,\nor the Triumph of Virtue, is not known to have reached either English\nreaders or English theatrical audiences. The French original, as we\nknow, fared scarcely better. “It was not until 1771,” says Diderot’s\nlatest English biographer, “that the directors of the French Comedy\ncould be induced to place Le Fils Naturel on the stage. The actors\ndetested their task, and, as we can well believe, went sulkily through\nparts which they had not taken the trouble to master. The public felt\nas little interest in the piece as the actors had done, and after one\nor two representations, it was put aside.[1]”",
        "[Footnote 1: Morley: Diderot and the Encyclopaedists, ii. 305.]",
        "Another, and it is to be guessed a too congenial, acquaintance formed\nby Sterne in Paris was that of Crébillon; and with him he concluded “a\nconvention,” unedifying enough, whether in jest or earnest: “As soon\nas I get to Toulouse he has agreed to write me an expostulatory\nletter upon the indecorums of T. Shandy, which is to be answered\nby recrimination upon the liberties in his own works. These are to\nbe printed together–Crébillon against Sterne, Sterne against\nCrébillon–the copy to be sold, and the money equally divided. This\nis good Swiss-policy,” he adds; and the idea (which was never carried\nout) had certainly the merit of ingenuity, if no other.",
        "The words “as soon as I get to Toulouse,” in a letter written from\nParis on the 10th of April, might well have reminded Sterne of the\nstrange way in which he had carried out his intention of “wintering\nin the South.” He insists, however, upon the curative effects of his\nwinter of gaiety in Paris. “I am recovered greatly,” he says; “and if\nI could spend one whole winter at Toulouse, I should be fortified in\nmy inner man beyond all danger of relapsing.” There was another, too,\nfor whom this change of climate had become imperatively necessary.\nFor three winters past his daughter Lydia, now fourteen years old,\nhad been suffering severely from asthma, and needed to try “the last\nremedy of a warmer and softer air.” Her father, therefore, was about\nto solicit passports for his wife and daughter, with a view to their\njoining him at once in Paris, whence, after a month’s stay, they were\nto depart together for the South. This application for passports he\nintended, he said, to make “this week:” and it would seem that the\nintention was carried out; but, for reasons explained in a letter\nwhich Mr. Fitzgerald was the first to publish, it was not till the\nmiddle of the next month that he was able to make preparation for\ntheir joining him. From this letter–written to his Archbishop, to\nrequest an extension of his leave–we learn that while applying for\nthe passports he was attacked with a fever, “which has ended the worst\nway it could for me, in a défluxion (de) poitrine, as the French\nphysicians call it. It is generally fatal to weak lungs, so that I\nhave lost in ten days all I have gained since I came here; and from\na relaxation of my lungs have lost my voice entirely, that ’twill\nbe much if I ever quite recover it. This evil sends me directly to\nToulouse, for which I set out from this place directly my family\narrives.” Evidently there was no time to be lost, and a week after the\ndate of this letter we find him in communication with Mrs. and\nMiss Sterne, and making arrangements for what was, in those days, a\nsomewhat formidable undertaking–the journey of two ladies from the\nNorth of England to the centre of France. The correspondence which\nensued may be said to give us the last pleasant glimpse of Sterne’s\nrelations with his wife. One can hardly help suspecting, of course,\nthat it was his solicitude for the safety and comfort of his\nmuch-loved daughter that mainly inspired the affectionate anxiety\nwhich pervades these letters to Mrs. Sterne; but their writer is, at\nthe very least, entitled to credit for allowing no difference of tone\nto reveal itself in the terms in which he speaks of wife and child.\nAnd, whichever of the two he was mainly thinking of, there is\nsomething very engaging in the thoughtful minuteness of his\ninstructions to the two women travellers, the earnestness of his\nattempts to inspire them with courage for their enterprise, and\nthe sincere fervour of his many commendations of them to the Divine\nkeeping. The mixture of “canny” counsel and pious invocation\nhas frequently a droll effect: as when the advice to “give the\ncustom-house officers what I told you, and at Calais more, if you have\nmuch Scotch snuff;” and “to drink small Rhenish to keep you cool, that\nis, if you like it,” is rounded off by the ejaculation, “So God in\nHeaven prosper and go along with you!” Letter after letter did he\nsend them, full of such reminders as that “they have bad pins and vile\nneedles here,” that it would be advisable to bring with them a strong\nbottle-screw, and a good stout copper tea-kettle; till at last, in\nthe final words of preparation, his language assumes something of the\nsolemnity of a general addressing his army on the eve of a well-nigh\ndesperate enterprise: “Pluck up your spirits–trust in God, in me,\nand yourselves; with this, was you put to it, you would encounter all\nthese difficulties ten times told. Write instantly, and tell me you\ntriumph over all fears–tell me Lydia is better, and a help-mate to\nyou. You say she grows like me: let her show me she does so in her\ncontempt of small dangers, and fighting against the apprehensions of\nthem, which is better still.”",
        "At last this anxiously awaited journey was taken; and, on Thursday,\nJuly 7, Mrs. Sterne and her daughter arrived in Paris. Their stay\nthere was not long–not much extended, probably, beyond the proposed\nweek. For Sterne’s health had, some ten days before the arrival of his\nfamily, again given him warning to depart quickly. He had but a few\nweeks recovered from the fever of which he spoke in his letter to\nthe Archbishop, when he again broke a blood-vessel in his lungs. It\nhappened in the night, and “finding in the morning that I was likely\nto bleed to death, I sent immediately,” he says, in a sentence which\nquaintly brings out the paradox of contemporary medical treatment,\n\"for a surgeon to bleed me at both arms. This saved me\"–i.e. did\nnot kill me–\"and, with lying speechless three days, I recovered upon\nmy back in bed: the breach healed, and in a week after I got out.\"\nBut the weakness which ensued, and the subsequent “hurrying about,” no\ndoubt as cicerone of Parisian sights to his wife and daughter, “made\nme think it high time to haste to Toulouse.” Accordingly, about the\n20th of the month, and “in the midst of such heats that the oldest\nFrenchman never remembers the like,” the party set off by way of Lyons\nand Montpellier for their Pyrenean destination. Their journey seems to\nhave been a journey of many mischances, extraordinary discomfort, and\nincredible length; and it is not till the second week in August that\nwe again take up the broken thread of his correspondence. Writing to\nMr. Foley, his banker in Paris, on the 14th of that month, he speaks\nof its having taken him three weeks to reach Toulouse; and adds that\n\"in our journey we suffered so much from the heats, it gives me pain\nto remember it. I never saw a cloud from Paris to Nismes half as\nbroad as a twenty-four sols piece. Good God! we were toasted, roasted,\ngrilled, stewed, carbonaded, on one side or other, all the way: and\nbeing all done through (_assez cuits_) in the day, we were eat up at\nnight by bugs and other unswept-out vermin, the legal inhabitants, if\nlength of possession give right, at every inn on the way.” A few miles\nfrom Beaucaire he broke a hind wheel of his carriage, and was obliged\nin consequence “to sit five hours on a gravelly road without one\ndrop of water, or possibility of getting any;” and here, to mend the\nmatter, he was cursed with “two dough-hearted fools” for postilions,\nwho “fell a-crying ’nothing was to be done!’” and could only be\nrecalled to a worthier and more helpful mood by Sterne’s “pulling off\nhis coat and waistcoat,” and “threatening to thrash them both within\nan inch of their lives.”",
        "The longest journey, however, must come to an end; and the party found\nmuch to console them at Toulouse for the miseries of travel. They were\nfortunate enough to secure one of those large, old comfortable houses\nwhich were and, here and there, perhaps, still are to be hired on the\noutskirts of provincial towns, at a rent which would now be thought\nabsurdly small; and Sterne writes in terms of high complacency of\nhis temporary abode. “Excellent,” “well furnished,” “elegant beyond\nanything I ever looked for,” are some of the expressions of praise\nwhich it draws from him. He observes with pride that the “very great\nsalle à compagnie is as large as Baron d’Holbach’s;” and he records\nwith great satisfaction–as well he might–that for the use of this\nand a country house two miles out of town, “besides the enjoyment of\ngardens, which the landlord engaged to keep in order,” he was to pay\nno more than thirty pounds a year. “All things,” he adds, “are cheap\nin proportion: so we shall live here for a very, very little.”",
        "And this, no doubt, was to Sterne a matter of some moment at this\ntime. The expenses of his long and tedious journey must have been\nheavy; and the gold-yielding vein of literary popularity, which he\nhad for three years been working, had already begun to show signs of\nexhaustion. Tristram Shandy had lost its first vogue; and the fifth\nand sixth volumes, the copyright of which he does not seem to have\ndisposed of, were “going off” but slowly.",
        "RETURN TO ENGLAND.–VOLS. VII. AND VIII.–SECOND\nSET OF SERMONS.",
        "The diminished appetite of the public for the humours of Mr. Shandy\nand his brother is, perhaps, not very difficult to understand. Time\nwas simply doing its usual wholesome work in sifting the false from\nthe true–in ridding Sterne’s audience of its contingent of sham\nadmirers. This is not to say, of course, that there might not have\nbeen other and better grounds for a partial withdrawal of popular\nfavour. A writer who systematically employs Sterne’s peculiar methods\nmust lay his account with undeserved loss as well as with unmerited\ngain. The fifth and sixth volumes deal quite largely enough in mere\neccentricity to justify the distaste of any reader upon whom mere\neccentricity had begun to pall. But if this were the sole explanation\nof the book’s declining popularity, we should have to admit that the\nadverse judgment of the public had been delayed too long for justice,\nand had passed over the worst to light upon the less heinous offences.\nFor the third volume, though its earlier pages contain some good\ntouches, drifts away into mere dull, uncleanly equivoque in its\nconcluding chapters; and the fifth and sixth volumes may, at any rate,\nquite safely challenge favourable comparison with the fourth–the\npoorest, I venture to think, of the whole series. There is nothing\nin these two later volumes to compare, for instance, with that most\nwearisome exercise in double entendre, Slawkenbergius’s Tale;\nnothing to match that painfully elaborate piece of low comedy, the\nconsultation of philosophers and its episode of Phutatorius’s mishap\nwith the hot chestnut; no such persistent resort, in short, to those\nmechanical methods of mirth-making upon which Sterne, throughout a\ngreat part of the fourth volume, almost exclusively relies. The humour\nof the fifth is, to a far larger extent, of the creative and dramatic\norder; the ever-delightful collision of intellectual incongruities in\nthe persons of the two brothers Shandy gives animation to the volume\nalmost from beginning to end. The arrival of the news of Bobby\nShandy’s death, and the contrast of its reception by the philosophic\nfather and the simple-minded uncle, form a scene of inimitable\nabsurdity, and the “Tristrapaedia,” with its ingenious project for\nopening up innumerable “tracks of inquiry” before the mind of the\npupil by sheer skill in the manipulation of the auxiliary verbs, is\nin the author’s happiest vein. The sixth volume, again, which contains\nthe irresistible dialogue between Mr. and Mrs. Shandy on the great\nquestion of the “breeching of Tristram,” and the much-admired, if not\nwholly admirable, episode of Le Fevre’s death, is fully entitled to\nrank beside its predecessors. On the whole, therefore, it must be said\nthat the colder reception accorded to this instalment of the novel,\nas compared with the previous one, can hardly be justified on sound\ncritical grounds. But that literary shortcomings were not, in fact,\nthe cause of Tristram’s declining popularity may be confidently\ninferred from the fact that the seventh volume, with its admirably\nvivid and spirited scenes of Continental travel, and the eighth and\nninth, with their charming narrative of Captain Shandy’s love affair,\nwere but slightly more successful. The readers whom this, the third\ninstalment of the novel, had begun to repel, were mainly, I imagine,\nthose who had never felt any intelligent admiration for the former;\nwho had been caught by the writer’s eccentricity, without appreciating\nhis insight into character and his graphic power, and who had seen no\nother aspects of his humour than those buffooneries and puerilities\nwhich, after first amusing, had begun, in the natural course of\nthings, to weary them.",
        "Meanwhile, however, and with spirits restored by the Southern warmth\nto that buoyancy which never long deserted them, Sterne had begun to\nset to work upon a new volume. His letters show that this was not\nthe seventh but the eighth; and Mr. Fitzgerald’s conjecture, that\nthe materials ultimately given to the world in the former volume were\noriginally designed for another work, appears exceedingly probable.\nBut for some time after his arrival at Toulouse he was unable, it\nwould seem, to resume his literary labours in any form. Ever liable,\nthrough his weakly constitution, to whatever local maladies might\nanywhere prevail, he had fallen ill, he writes to Hall Stevenson, “of\nan epidemic vile fever which killed hundreds about me. The physicians\nhere,” he adds, “are the arrantest charlatans in Europe, or the most\nignorant of all pretending fools. I withdrew what was left of me out\nof their hands, and recommended my affairs entirely to Dame Nature.\nShe (dear goddess) has saved me in fifty different pinching bouts, and\nI begin to have a kind of enthusiasm now in her favour and my own, so\nthat one or two more escapes will make me believe I shall leave you\nall at last by translation, and not by fair death.” Having now become\n\"stout and foolish again as a man can wish to be, I am,” he says,\n\"busy playing the fool with my Uncle Toby, whom I have got soused over\nhead and ears in love.” Now, it is not till the eighth volume that\nthe Widow Wadman begins to weave her spells around Captain Shandy’s\ningenuous heart; while the seventh volume is mainly composed of that\nseries of travel-pictures in which Sterne has manifestly recorded\nhis own impressions of Northern France in the person of the youthful\nTristram. It is scarcely doubtful, therefore, that it is these\nsketches, and the use which he then proposed to make of them, that\nhe refers to, when speaking in this letter of “hints and projects\nfor other works.” Originally intended to form a part of the volume\nafterwards published as the Sentimental Journey, it was found\nnecessary–under pressure, it is to be supposed, of insufficient\nmatter–to work them up instead into an interpolated seventh volume\nof Tristram Shandy. At the moment, however, he no doubt as little\nforesaw this as he did the delay which was to take place before any\ncontinuation of the novel appeared. He clearly contemplated no very\nlong absence from England. “When I have reaped the benefit of the\nwinter at Toulouse, I cannot see I have anything more to do with it.\nTherefore, after having gone with my wife and girl to Bagnères, I\nshall return from whence I came.” Already, however, one can perceive\nsigns of his having too presumptuously marked out his future. “My\nwife wants to stay another year, to save money; and this opposition of\nwishes, though it will not be as sour as lemon, yet ’twill not be as\nsweet as sugar.” And again: “If the snows will suffer me, I propose to\nspend two or three months at Barége or Bagnères; but my dear wife is\nagainst all schemes of additional expense, which wicked propensity\n(though not of despotic power) yet I cannot suffer–though,\nby-the-bye, laudable enough. But she may talk; I will go my own way,\nand she will acquiesce without a word of debate on the subject. Who\ncan say so much in praise of his wife? Few, I trow.” The tone of\ncontemptuous amiability shows pretty clearly that the relations\nbetween husband and wife had in nowise improved. But wives do not\nalways lose all their influence over husbands’ wills along with the\npower over their affections; and it will be seen that Sterne did notmake his projected winter trip to Bagnères, and that he did remain\nat Toulouse for a considerable part of the second year for which Mrs.\nSterne desired to prolong their stay. The place, however, was not to\nhis taste; and he was not the first traveller in France who, delighted\nwith the gaiety of Paris, has been disappointed at finding that French\nprovincial towns can be as dull as dulness itself could require. It is\nin the somewhat unjust mood which is commonly begotten of disillusion\nthat Sterne discovers the cause of his ennui in “the eternal\nplatitude of the French character,” with its “little variety and no\noriginality at all.” “They are very civil,” he admits, “but civility\nitself so thus uniform wearies and bothers me to death. If I do\nnot mind I shall grow most stupid and sententious.” With such\napprehensions it is not surprising that he should have eagerly\nwelcomed any distraction that chance might offer, and in December we\nfind him joyfully informing his chief correspondent of the period,\nMr. Foley–who to his services as Sterne’s banker seems to have added\nthose of a most helpful and trusted friend–that “there are a company\nof English strollers arrived here who are to act comedies all the\nChristmas, and are now busy in making dresses and preparing some of\nour best comedies.” These so-called strollers were, in fact, certain\nmembers of the English colony in Toulouse, and their performances were\namong the first of those “amateur theatrical” entertainments which\nnow-a-days may be said to rival the famous “morning drum-beat” of\nDaniel Webster’s oration, in marking the ubiquity of British boredom,\nas the reveil does that of British power over all the terrestrial\nglobe. “The next week,” writes Sterne, “with a grand orchestra, we\nplay The Busybody, and the Journey to London the week after; but\nI have some thought of adapting it to our situation, and making it the\nJourney to Toulouse, which, with the change of half-a-dozen scenes,\nmay be easily done. Thus, my dear Foley, for want of something better\nwe have recourse to ourselves, and strike out the best amusements we\ncan from such materials.” “Recourse to ourselves,” however, means,\nin strict accuracy, “recourse to each other;” and when the amateur\nplayers had played themselves out, and exhausted their powers of\ncontributing to each others’ amusement, it is probable that\n\"recourse to ourselves,” in the exact sense of the phrase, was found\nineffective–in Sterne’s case, at any rate–to stave off ennui.\nTo him, with his copiously if somewhat oddly furnished mind, and his\nnatural activity of imagination, one could hardly apply the line of\nPersius,",
        "  “Tecum habita et noris quam sit tibi curta supellex;”",
        "but it is yet evident enough that Sterne’s was one of that numerous\norder of intellects which are the convivial associates, rather than\nthe fireside companions, of their owners, and which, when deprived\nof the stimulus of external excitement, are apt to become very dull\ncompany indeed. Nor does he seem to have obtained much diversion of\nmind from his literary work–a form of intellectual enjoyment which,\nindeed, more often presupposes than begets good spirits in such\ntemperaments as his. He declares, it is true, that he “sports much\nwith my Uncle Toby” in the volume which he is now “fabricating for the\nlaughing part of the world;” but if so he must have sported only after\na very desultory and dilatory fashion. On the whole one cannot escape\na very strong impression that Sterne was heartily bored by his sojourn\nin Toulouse, and that he eagerly longed for the day of his return to\n\"the dalliance and the wit, the flattery and the strife,” which he had\nleft behind him in the two great capitals in which he had shone.",
        "His stay, however, was destined to be very prolonged. The winter of\n1762 went by, and the succeeding year had run nearly half its course,\nbefore he changed his quarters. “The first week in June,” he writes in\nApril to Mr. Foley, “I decamp like a patriarch, with all my household,\nto pitch our tents for three months at the foot of the Pyrenean hills\nat Bagnères, where I expect much health and much amusement from all\ncorners of the earth.” He talked too at this time of spending the\nwinter at Florence, and, after a visit to Leghorn, returning home the\nfollowing April by way of Paris; “but this,” he adds, “is a sketch\nonly,” and it remained only a sketch. Toulouse, however, he was in\nany case resolved to quit. He should not, he said, be tempted to spend\nanother winter there. It did not suit his health, as he had hoped: he\ncomplained that it was too moist, and that he could not keep clear of\nague. In June, 1763, he quitted it finally for Bagnères; whence after\na short, and, as we subsequently learn, a disappointed, sojourn, he\npassed on to Marseilles, and later to Aix, for both of which places\nhe expressed dislike; and by October he had gone again into winter\nquarters at Montpellier, where “my wife and daughter,” he writes,\n\"purpose to stay at least a year behind me.” His own intention was to\nset out in February for England, “where my heart has been fled these\nsix months.” Here again, however, there are traces of that periodic,\nor rather, perhaps, that chronic conflict of inclination between\nhimself and Mrs. Sterne, of which he speaks with such a tell-tale\naffectation of philosophy. “My wife,” he writes in January, “returns\nto Toulouse, and proposes to spend the summer at Bagnères. I, on the\ncontrary, go to visit my wife the church in Yorkshire. We all live the\nlonger, at least the happier, for having things our own way. This is\nmy conjugal maxim. I own ’tis not the best of maxims, but I maintain\n’tis not the worst.” It was natural enough that Sterne, at any rate,\nshould wish to turn his back on Montpellier. Again had the unlucky\ninvalid been attacked by a dangerous illness; the “sharp air” of the\nplace disagreed with him, and his physicians, after having him under\ntheir hands more than a month, informed him coolly that if he stayed\nany longer in Montpellier it would be fatal to him. How soon after\nthat somewhat late warning he took his departure there is no record\nto show; but it is not till the middle of May that we find him writing\nfrom Paris to his daughter. And since he there announces his intention\nof leaving for England in a few days, it is a probable conjecture that\nhe had arrived at the French capital some fortnight or so before.",
        "His short stay in Paris was marked by two incidents–trifling in\nthemselves, but too characteristic of the man to be omitted. Lord\nHertford, the British Ambassador, had just taken a magnificent hotel\nin Paris, and Sterne was asked to preach the first sermon in its\nchapel. The message was brought him, he writes, “when I was playing\na sober game of whist with Mr. Thornhill; and whether I was called\nabruptly from my afternoon amusement to prepare myself for the\nbusiness on the next day, or from what other cause, I do not pretend\nto determine; but that unlucky kind of fit seized me which you know\nI am never able to resist, and a very unlucky text did come into my\nhead.” The text referred to was 2 Kings XX. 15–Hezekiah’s admission\nof that ostentatious display of the treasures of his palace to the\nambassadors of Babylon for which Isaiah rebuked him by prophesying the\nBabylonian captivity of Judah. Nothing, indeed, as Sterne protests,\ncould have been more innocent than the discourse which he founded\nupon the mal-à-propos text; but still it was unquestionably a fair\nsubject for “chaff,” and the preacher was rallied upon it by no less\na person than David Hume. Gossip having magnified this into a dispute\nbetween the parson and the philosopher, Sterne disposes of the idle\nstory in a passage deriving an additional interest from its tribute to\nthat sweet disposition which had an equal charm for two men so utterly\nunlike as the author of Tristram Shandy and the author of the\nWealth of Nations. “I should,” he writes, “be exceedingly surprised\nto hear that David ever had an unpleasant contention with any man; and\nif I should ever be made to believe that such an event had happened,\nnothing would persuade me that his opponent was not in the wrong, for\nin my life did I never meet with a being of a more placid and gentle\nnature; and it is this amiable turn of his character which has given\nmore consequence and force to his scepticism than all the arguments of\nhis sophistry.” The real truth of the matter was that, meeting Sterne\nat Lord Hertford’s table on the day when he had preached at the\nEmbassy Chapel, “David was disposed to make a little merry with the\nparson, and in return the parson was equally disposed to make a little\nmerry with the infidel. We laughed at one another, and the company\nlaughed with us both.” It would be absurd, of course, to identify\nSterne’s latitudinarian bonhomie with the higher order of tolerance;\nbut many a more confirmed and notorious Gallio than the clerical\nhumourist would have assumed prudish airs of orthodoxy in such a\npresence, and the incident, if it does not raise one’s estimate of\nSterne’s dignity, displays him to us as laudably free from hypocrisy.",
        "But the long holiday of somewhat dull travel, with its short last act\nof social gaiety, was drawing to a close. In the third or fourth week\nof May Sterne quitted Paris; and after a stay of a few weeks in London\nhe returned to the Yorkshire parsonage, from which he had been absent\nsome thirty months.",
        "Unusually long as was the interval which had elapsed since the\npublication of the last instalment of Tristram Shandy, the new one\nwas far from ready; and even in the “sweet retirement” of Coxwold\nhe seems to have made but slow progress with it. Indeed, the “sweet\nretirement” itself became soon a little tedious to him. The month of\nSeptember found him already bored with work and solitude; and the fine\nautumn weather of 1764 set him longing for a few days’ pleasure-making\nat what was even then the fashionable Yorkshire watering-place. “I\ndo not think,” he writes, with characteristic incoherence, to Hall\nStevenson–\"I do not think a week or ten days’ playing the good fellow\n(at this very time) so abominable a thing; but if a man could get\nthere cleverly, and every soul in his house in the mind to try what\ncould be done in furtherance thereof, I have no one to consult in\nthese affairs. Therefore, as a man may do worse things, the plain\nEnglish of all which is, that I am going to leave a few poor sheep in\nthe wilderness for fourteen days, and from pride and naughtiness\nof heart to go see what is doing at Scarborough, steadfully meaning\nafterwards to lead a new life and strengthen my faith. Now, some folks\nsay there is much company there, and some say not; and I believe there\nis neither the one nor the other, but will be both if the world will\nhave patience for a month or so.” Of his work he has not much to say:\n\"I go on not rapidly but well enough with my Uncle Toby’s amours.\nThere is no sitting and cudgelling one’s brains whilst the sun shines\nbright. ’Twill be all over in six or seven weeks; and there are dismal\nweeks enow after to endure suffocation by a brimstone fireside.” He\nwas anxious that his boon companion should join him at Scarborough;\nbut that additional pleasure was denied him, and he had to content\nhimself with the usual gay society of the place. Three weeks, it\nseems, were passed by him in this most doubtfully judicious form of\nbodily and mental relaxation–weeks which he spent, he afterwards\nwrites, in “drinking the waters, and receiving from them marvellous\nstrength, had I not debilitated it as fast as I got it by playing\nthe good fellow with Lord Granby and Co. too much.” By the end of the\nmonth he was back again at Coxwold, “returned to my Philosophical Hut\nto finish Tristram, which I calculate will be ready for the\nworld about Christmas, at which time I decamp from hence and fix\nmy headquarters at London for the winter, unless my cough pushes me\nforward to your metropolis” (he is writing to Foley, in Paris), “or\nthat I can persuade some gros milord to make a trip to you.\"\nAgain, too, in this letter we get another glimpse at that thoroughly\ndesentimentalized “domestic interior” which the sentimentalist’s\nhousehold had long presented to the view. Writing to request a\nremittance of money to Mrs. Sterne at Montauban–a duty which, to do\nhim justice, he seems to have very watchfully observed–Sterne adds\nhis solicitation to Mr. Foley to “do something equally essential to\nrectify a mistake in the mind of your correspondent there, who, it\nseems, gave her a hint not long ago ’that she was separated from me\nfor life.’ Now, as this is not true, in the first place, and may fix a\ndisadvantageous impression of her to those she lives amongst, ’twould\nbe unmerciful to let her or my daughter suffer by it. So do be so good\nas to undeceive him; for in a year or two she purposes (and I expect\nit with impatience from her) to rejoin me.”",
        "Early in November the two new volumes of Shandy began to approach\ncompletion; for by this time Sterne had already made up his mind to\ninterpolate these notes of his French travels, which now do duty as\nVol. VII. “You will read,” he tells Foley, “as odd a tour through\nFrance as was ever projected or executed by traveller or travel-writer\nsince the world began. ’Tis a laughing, good-tempered satire upon\ntravelling–as puppies travel.” By the 16th of the month he had\n\"finished my two volumes of Tristram,” and looked to be in London at\nChristmas, “whence I have some thoughts of going to Italy this year.\nAt least I shall not defer it above another.” On the 26th of January,\n1765, the two new volumes were given to the world.",
        "Shorter in length than any of the preceding instalments, and filled\nout as it was, even so, by a process of what would now be called\n\"book-making,” this issue will yet bear comparison, I think, with the\nbest of its predecessors. Its sketches of travel, though destined\nto be surpassed in vigour and freedom of draftsmanship by the\nSentimental Journey, are yet excellent, and their very obvious want\nof connexion with the story–if story it can be called–is so little\nfelt that we almost resent the head-and-ears introduction of Mr.\nShandy and his brother, and the Corporal, in apparent concession to\nthe popular prejudice in favour of some sort of coherence between\nthe various parts of a narrative. The first seventeen chapters are,\nperhaps, as freshly delightful reading as anything in Sterne. They are\nliterally filled and brimming over with the exhilaration of travel:\nwritten, or at least prepared for writing, we can clearly see, under\nthe full intoxicant effect which a bewildering succession of new\nsights and sounds will produce, in a certain measure, upon the coolest\nof us, and which would set a head like Sterne’s in an absolute whirl.\nThe contagion of his high spirits is, however, irresistible; and,\nputting aside all other and more solid qualities in them, these\nchapters are, for mere fun–for that kind of clever nonsense which\nonly wins by perfect spontaneity, and which so promptly makes ashamed\nthe moment spontaneity fails–unsurpassed by anything of the same kind\nfrom the same hand. How strange, then, that, with so keen an eye for\nthe humorous, so sound and true a judgment in the highest qualities of\nhumour, Sterne should think it possible for any one who has outgrown\nwhat may be called the dirty stage of boyhood to smile at the story\nwhich begins a few chapters afterwards–that of the Abbess and Novice\nof the Convent of Andouillets! The adult male person is not so much\nshocked at the coarseness of this story as astounded at the bathos of\nits introduction. It is as though some matchless connoisseur in wine,\nafter having a hundred times demonstrated the unerring discrimination\nof his palate for the finest brands, should then produce some vile and\nloaded compound, and invite us to drink it with all the relish with\nwhich he seems to be swallowing it himself. This story of the Abbess\nand Novice almost impels us to turn back to certain earlier chapters,\nor former volumes, and re-examine some of the subtler passages of\nhumour to be found there–in downright apprehension lest we should\nturn out to have read these “good things,” not “in,” but “into,” our\nauthor. The bad wine is so very bad, that we catch ourselves wondering\nwhether the finer brands were genuine, when we see the same palate\nequally satisfied with both. But one should, of course, add that it\nis only in respect of its supposed humour that this story shakes\nits readers’ faith in the gifts of the narrator. As a mere piece of\nstory-telling, and even as a study in landscape and figure-painting,\nit is quite perversely skilful. There is something almost irritating,\nas a waste of powers on unworthy material, in the prettiness of the\npicture which Sterne draws of the preparations for the departure\nof the two religieuses–the stir in the simple village, the\nco-operating labours of the gardener and the tailor, the carpenter and\nthe smith, and all those other little details which bring the whole\nscene before the eye so vividly that Sterne may, perhaps, in\nall seriousness, and not merely as a piece of his characteristic\npersiflage, have thrown in the exclamation, “I declare I am interested\nin this story, and wish I had been there.” Nothing, again, could be\nbetter done than the sketch of the little good-natured, “broad-set\"\ngardener, who acted as the ladies’ muleteer, and the recital of the\nindiscretions by which he was betrayed into temporary desertion of his\nduties. The whole scene is Chaucerian in its sharpness of outline\nand translucency of atmosphere: though there, unfortunately, the\nresemblance ends. Sterne’s manner of saying what we now leave unsaid\nis as unlike Chaucer’s, and as unlike for the worse, as it can\npossibly be.",
        "Still, a certain amount of this element of the non nominandum must\nbe compounded for, one regrets to say, in nearly every chapter that\nSterne ever wrote; and there is certainly less than the average amount\nof it in the seventh volume. Then, again, this volume contains the\nfamous scene with the ass–the live and genuinely touching, and not\nthe dead and fictitiously pathetic, animal; and that perfect piece of\ncomic dialogue–the interview between the puzzled English traveller\nand the French commissary of the posts. To have suggested this scene\nis, perhaps, the sole claim of the absurd fiscal system of the Ancien\nrégime upon the grateful remembrance of the world. A scheme of\ntaxation which exacted posting-charges from a traveller who proposed\nto continue his journey by water, possesses a natural ingredient of\ndrollery infused into its mere vexatiousness; but a whole volume of\nsatire could hardly put its essential absurdity in a stronger\nlight than is thrown upon it in the short conversation between the\nastonished Tristram and the officer of the fisc, who had just handed\nhim a little bill for six livres four sous:",
        "  “’Upon what account?’ said I.",
        "  “’’Tis upon the part of the King,’ said the commissary, heaving\n  up his shoulders.",
        "  “’My good friend,’ quoth I, ’as sure as I am I, and you are you–’",
        "  “’And who are you?’ he said.",
        "  “’Don’t puzzle me,’ said I. ’But it is an indubitable verity,’ I\n  continued, addressing myself to the commissary, changing only the\n  form of my asseveration,’ that I owe the King of France nothing but\n  my good-will, for he is a very honest man, and I wish him all the health\n  and pastime in the world.’",
        "  “’Pardonnez-moi,’ replied the commissary. ’You are indebted to\n  him six livres four sous for the next post from hence to St. Fons, on\n  your route to Avignon, which being a post royal, you pay double for\n  the horses and postilion, otherwise ’twould have amounted to no more\n  than three livres two sous.’",
        "  “’But I don’t go by land,’ said I.",
        "  “’You may if you please,’ replied the commissary.",
        "  “’Your most obedient servant,’ said I, making him a low bow.",
        "  “The commissary, with all the sincerity of grave good-breeding,\n  made me one as low again. I never was more disconcerted by a bow\n  in my life. ’The devil take the serious character of these people,’\n  said I, aside; ’they understand no more of irony than this.’ The\n  comparison was standing close by with her panniers, but something\n  sealed up my lips. I could not pronounce the name.",
        "  “’Sir,’ said I, collecting myself, ’it is not my intention to take\n  post.’",
        "  “’But you may,’ said he, persisting in his first reply. ’You may\n  if you choose.’",
        "  “’And I may take salt to my pickled herring if I choose.[1] But I\n  do not choose.’",
        "  “’But you must pay for it, whether you do or no.’",
        "  “’Ay, for the salt,’ said I, ’I know.’",
        "  “’And for the post, too,’ added he.",
        "  “’Defend me!’ cried I. ’I travel by water. I am going down the\n  Rhone this very afternoon; my baggage is in the boat, and I have\n  actually paid nine livres for my passage.’",
        "  “’C’est tout égal–’tis all one,’ said he.",
        "  “’Bon Dieu! What! pay for the way I go and for the way I do\n  not go?’",
        "  “’C’est tout égal,’ replied the commissary.",
        "  “’The devil it is!’ said I. ’But I will go to ten thousand Bastilles\n  first. O, England! England! thou land of liberty and climate of\n  good-sense! thou tenderest of mothers and gentlest of nurses!’ cried\n  I, kneeling upon one knee as I was beginning my apostrophe–when\n  the director of Madame L. Blanc’s conscience coming in at that instant,\n  and seeing a person in black, with a face as pale as ashes, at\n  his devotions, asked if I stood in want of the aids of the Church.",
        "  “’I go by water,’ said I, ’and here’s another will be for making\n  me pay for going by oil.’”",
        "[Footnote 1: It is the penalty–I suppose the just penalty–paid by\nhabitually extravagant humourists, that meaning not being always\nexpected of them, it is not always sought by their readers with\nsufficient care. Anyhow, it may be suspected that this retort of\nTristram’s is too often passed over as a mere random absurdity\ndesigned for his interlocutor’s mystification, and that its extremely\nfelicitous pertinence to the question in dispute is thus overlooked.\nThe point of it, of course, is that the business in which the\ncommissary was then engaged was precisely analogous to that of\nexacting salt dues from perverse persons who were impoverishing the\nrevenue by possessing herrings already pickled.]",
        "The commissary, of course, remains obdurate, and Tristram protests\nthat the treatment to which he is being subjected is “contrary to the\nlaw of nature, contrary to reason, contrary to the Gospel:”",
        "  “’But not to this,’ said he, putting a printed paper into my hand.",
        "  “’De par le Roi.’ ’’Tis a pithy prolegomenon,’ quoth I, and so\n  read on.... ’By all which it appears,’ quoth I, having read it over\n  a little too rapidly, ’that if a man sets out in a post-chaise for Paris,\n  he must go on travelling in one all the days of his life, or pay for it.’",
        "  “’Excuse me,’ said the commissary, ’the spirit of the ordinance is\n  this, that if you set out with an intention of running post from Paris\n  to Avignon, &c., you shall not change that intention or mode of\n  travelling without first satisfying the fermiers for two posts further\n  than the place you repent at; and ’tis founded,’ continued he, ’upon\n  this, that the revenues are not to fall short through your fickleness.’",
        "  “’O, by heavens!’ cried I, ’if fickleness is taxable in France, we\n  have nothing to do but to make the best peace we can.’",
        "  “And so the peace was made.”",
        "And the volume ends with the dance of villagers on “the road between\nNismes and Lunel, where is the best Muscatto wine in all France\"–that\ncharming little idyll which won the unwilling admiration of the least\nfriendly of Sterne’s critics.[1]",
        "With the close of this volume the shadowy Tristram disappears\naltogether from the scene; and even the clearly-sketched figures of\nMr. and Mrs. Shandy recede somewhat into the background. The courtship\nof my Uncle Toby forms the whole motif and indeed almost the entire\nsubstance, of the next volume. Of this famous episode in the novel a\ngreat deal has been said and written, and much of the praise\nbestowed upon it is certainly deserved. The artful coquetries of the\nfascinating widow, and the gradual capitulation of the Captain, are\nstudied with admirable power of humorous insight, and described with\ninfinite grace and skill. But there is, perhaps, no episode in the\nnovel which brings out what may be called the perversity of Sterne’s\nanimalism in a more exasperating way. It is not so much the amount\nof this element as the time, place, and manner in which it makes its\npresence felt. The senses must, of course, play their part in all\nlove affairs, except those of the angels–or the triangles; and such\nwriters as Byron, for instance, are quite free from the charge of\nover-spiritualizing their description of the passion. Yet one might\nsafely say that there is far less to repel a healthy mind in the\npoet’s account of the amour of Juan and Haidee than is to be found in\nmany a passage in this volume. It is not merely that one is the poetry\nand the other the prose of the sexual passion: the distinction goes\ndeeper, and points to a fundamental difference of attitude towards\ntheir subject in the two writers’ minds.",
        "The success of this instalment of Tristram Shandy appears to have\nbeen slightly greater than that of the preceding one. Writing from\nLondon, where he was once more basking in the sunshine of social\npopularity, to Garrick, then in Paris, he says (March 16, 1765): “I\nhave had a lucrative campaign here. Shandy sells well,” and “I am\ntaxing the public with two more volumes of sermons, which will more\nthan double the gains of Shandy. It goes into the world with a\nprancing list de toute la noblesse, which will bring me in three\nhundred pounds, exclusive of the sale of the copy.” The list was,\nindeed, extensive and distinguished enough to justify the curious\nepithet which he applies to it; but the cavalcade of noble names\ncontinued to “prance” for some considerable time without advancing.\nYet he had good reasons, according to his own account, for wishing to\npush on their publication. His parsonage-house at Button had just been\nburnt down through the carelessness of one of his curate’s household,\nwith a loss to Sterne of some 350_l. “As soon as I can,” he says, “I\nmust rebuild it, but I lack the means at present.” Nevertheless, the\nnew sermons continued to hang fire. Again, in April he describes the\nsubscription list as “the most splendid list which ever pranced before\na book since subscription came into fashion;” but though the volumes\nwhich it was to usher into the world were then spoken of as about to\nbe printed “very soon,” he has again in July to write of them only\nas “forthcoming in September, though I fear not in time to bring them\nwith me” to Paris. And, as a matter of fact, they do not seem to have\nmade their appearance until after Sterne had quitted England on his\nsecond and last Continental journey. The full subscription list may\nhave had the effect of relaxing his energies; but the subscribers had\nno reason to complain when, in 1766, the volumes at last appeared.",
        "The reception given to the first batch of sermons which Sterne had\npublished was quite favourable enough to encourage a repetition of the\nexperiment. He was shrewd enough, however, to perceive that on\nthis second occasion a somewhat different sort of article would be\nrequired. In the first flush of Tristram Shandy’s success, and in\nthe first piquancy of the contrast between the grave profession of the\nwriter and the unbounded license of the book, he could safely reckon\non as large and curious a public for any sermons whatever from the\npen of Mr. Yorick. There was no need that the humourist in his pulpit\nshould at all resemble the humourist at his desk, or, indeed, that\nhe should be in any way an impressive or commanding figure. The great\ndesire of the world was to know what he did resemble in this new\nand incongruous position. Men wished to see what the queer, sly face\nlooked like over a velvet cushion, in the assurance that the sight\nwould be a strange and interesting one, at any rate. Five years\nafterwards, however, the case was different. The public then had\nalready had one set of sermons, and had discovered that the humorous\nMr. Sterne was not a very different man in the pulpit from the dullest\nand most decorous of his brethren. Such discoveries as these are\ninstructive to make, but not attractive to dwell upon; and Sterne was\nfully alive to the probability that there would be no great demand for\na volume of sermons which should only illustrate for the second time\nthe fact that he could be as commonplace as his neighbour. He saw that\nin future the Rev. Mr. Yorick must a little more resemble the author\nof Tristram Shandy, and it is not improbable that from 1760 onwards\nhe composed his parochial sermons with especial attention to this mode\nof qualifying them for republication. There is, at any rate, no slight\ncritical difficulty in believing that the bulk of the sermons of 1766\ncan be assigned to the same literary period as the sermons of 1761.\nThe one set seems as manifestly to belong to the post-Shandian as\nthe other does to the pre-Shandian era; and in some, indeed, of\nthe apparently later productions the daring quaintness of style and\nillustration is carried so far that, except for the fact that Sterne\nhad no time to spare for the composition of sermons not intended for\nprofessional use, one would have been disposed to believe that they\nneither were nor were meant to be delivered from the pulpit at all.[1]\nThroughout all of them, however, Sterne’s new-found literary power\ndisplays itself in a vigour of expression and vivacity of illustration\nwhich at least serve to make the sermons of 1766 considerably more\nentertaining reading than those of 1761. In the first of the latter\nseries, for instance–the sermon on Shimei–a discourse in which there\nare no very noticeable sallies of unclerical humour, the quality of\nliveliness is very conspicuously present. The preacher’s view of the\ncharacter of Shimei, and of his behaviour to David, is hardly that,\nperhaps, of a competent historical critic, and in treating of the\nBenjamite’s insults to the King of Israel he appears to take no\naccount of the blood-feud between the house of David and the clan\nto which the railer belonged; just as in commenting on Shimei’s\nsubsequent and most abject submission to the victorious monarch,\nSterne lays altogether too much stress upon conduct which is\nindicative, not so much of any exceptional meanness of disposition,\nas of the ordinary suppleness of the Oriental put in fear of his life.\nHowever, it makes a more piquant and dramatic picture to represent\nShimei as a type of the wretch of insolence and servility compact,\nwith a tongue ever ready to be loosed against the unfortunate, and a\nknee ever ready to be bent to the strong. And thus he moralizes on his\nconception:",
        "[Footnote 1: Mr. Fitzgerald, indeed, asserts as a fact that some\nat least of these sermons were actually composed in the capacity\nof littérateur and not of divine–for the press and not for the\npulpit.]",
        "  “There is not a character in the world which has so bad an influence\n  upon it as this of Shimei. While power meets with honest\n  checks, and the evils of life with honest refuge, the world will never\n  be undone; but thou, Shimei, hast sapped it at both extremes: for\n  thou corruptest prosperity, and ’tis thou who hast broken the heart\n  of poverty. And so long as worthless spirits can be ambitious ones\n  ’tis a character we never shall want. Oh! it infests the court, the\n  camp, the cabinet; it infests the Church. Go where you will, in\n  every quarter, in every profession, you see a Shimei following the\n  wheels of the fortunate through thick mire and clay. Haste, Shimei,\n  haste! or thou wilt be undone forever. Shimei girdeth up his loins\n  and speedeth after him. Behold the hand which governs everything\n  takes the wheel from his chariot, so that he who driveth, driveth on\n  heavily. Shimei doubles his speed; but ’tis the contrary way: he flies\n  like the wind over a sandy desert.... Stay, Shimei! ’tis your patron,\n  your friend, your benefactor, the man who has saved you from the\n  dunghill. ’Tis all one to Shimei. Shimei is the barometer of every\n  man’s fortune; marks the rise and fall of it, with all the variations\n  from scorching hot to freezing cold upon his countenance that the\n  simile will admit of.[1] Is a cloud upon thy affairs? See, it hangs\n  over Shimei’s brow! Hast thou been spoken for to the king or the\n  captain of the host without success? Look not into the Court Calendar,\n  the vacancy is filled in Shimei’s face. Art thou in debt, though\n  not to Shimei? No matter. The worst officer of the law shall not\n  be more insolent. What, then, Shimei, is the fault of poverty so\n  black? is it of so general concern that thou and all thy family must\n  rise up as one man to reproach it? When it lost everything, did it\n  lose the right to pity too? Or did he who maketh poor as well as\n  maketh rich strip it of its natural powers to mollify the heart and\n  supple the temper of your race? Trust me you have much to answer\n  for. It is this treatment which it has ever met with from spirits\n  like yours which has gradually taught the world to look upon it\n  as the greatest of evils, and shun it as the worst disgrace. And what\n  is it, I beseech you–what is it that men will not do to keep clear of\n  so sore an imputation and punishment? Is it not to fly from this\n  that he rises early, late takes rest, and eats the bread of carefulness?\n  that he plots, contrives, swears, lies, shuffles, puts on all shapes,\n  tries all garments, wears them with this or that side outward, just as\n  it may favour his escape?”",
        "And though the sermon ends in orthodox fashion, with an assurance\nthat, in spite of the Shimeis by whom we are surrounded, it is in\nour power to “lay the foundation of our peace (where it ought to be)\nwithin our own hearts,” yet the preacher can, in the midst of his\nearlier reflections, permit himself the quaintly pessimistic outburst:\n\"O Shimei! would to Heaven, when thou wast slain, that all thy family\nhad been slain with thee, and not one of thy resemblance left! But\nye have multiplied exceedingly, and replenished the earth; and if I\nprophesy rightly, ye will in the end subdue it.”",
        "[Footnote 1: Which are not many in the case of a barometer.]",
        "Nowhere, however, does the man of the world reveal himself with more\nstrangely comical effect under the gown of the divine than in the\nsermon on “The Prodigal Son.” The repentant spendthrift has returned\nto his father’s house, and is about to confess his follies. But–",
        "  “Alas! How shall he tell his story?",
        "  “Ye who have trod this round, tell me in what words he shall give\n  in to his father the sad items of his extravagance and folly: the\n  feasts and banquets which he gave to whole cities in the East; the\n  costs of Asiatic rarities, and of Asiatic cooks to dress them; the\n  expenses of singing men and singing women; the flute, the harp, the\n  sackbut, and all kinds of music; the dress of the Persian Court how\n  magnificent! their slaves how numerous! their chariots, their homes,\n  their pictures, their furniture, what immense sums they had devoured!\n  what expectations from strangers of condition! what exactions!\n  How shall the youth make his father comprehend that he was cheated\n  at Damascus by one of the best men in the world; that he had\n  lent a part of his substance to a friend at Nineveh, who had fled off\n  with it to the Ganges; that a whore of Babylon had swallowed his\n  best pearl, and anointed the whole city with his balm of Gilead; that\n  he had been sold by a man of honour for twenty shekels of silver to\n  a worker in graven images; that the images he had purchased produced\n  him nothing, that they could not be transported across the\n  wilderness, and had been burnt with fire at Shusan; that the apes\n  and peacocks which he had sent for from Tharsis lay dead upon his\n  hands; that the mummies had not been dead long enough which he\n  had brought from Egypt; that all had gone wrong from the day he\n  forsook his father’s house?”",
        "All this, it must be admitted, is pretty lively for a sermon. But hear\nthe reverend gentleman once more, in the same discourse, and observe\nthe characteristic coolness with which he touches, only to drop, what\nmay be called the “professional” moral of the parable, and glides\noff into a train of interesting, but thoroughly mundane, reflections,\nsuggested–or rather, supposed in courtesy to have been suggested–by\nthe text. “I know not,” he says, “whether it would be a subject\nof much edification to convince you here that our Saviour, by the\nProdigal Son, particularly pointed out those who were sinners of the\nGentiles, and were recovered by divine grace to repentance; and that\nby the elder brother he intended manifestly the more forward of the\nJews,” &c. But, whether it would edify you or not, he goes on, in\neffect, to say, I do not propose to provide you with edification in\nthat kind. “These uses have been so ably set forth in so many good\nsermons upon the Prodigal Son that I shall turn aside from them at\npresent, and content myself with some reflections upon that fatal\npassion which led him–and so many thousands after the example–to\ngather all he had together and take his journey into a far country.\"\nIn other words, “I propose to make the parable a peg whereon to hang\na few observations on (what does the reader suppose?) the practice of\nsending young men upon the Grand Tour, accompanied by a ’bear-leader,’\nand herein of the various kinds of bear-leaders, and the services\nwhich they do, and do not, render to their charges; with a few words\non society in Continental cities, and a true view of ’letters of\nintroduction.’” That is literally the substance of the remainder\nof the sermon. And thus pleasantly does the preacher play with his\ncurious subject:",
        "  “But you will send an able pilot with your son–a scholar. If\n  wisdom can speak in no other tongue but Greek or Latin, you do\n  well; or if mathematics will make a man a gentleman, or natural\n  philosophy but teach him to make a bow, he may be of some service\n  in introducing your son into good societies, and supporting him in\n  them when he had done. But the upshot will be generally this, that\n  on the most pressing occasions of addresses, if he is not a mere man\n  of reading, the unhappy youth will have the tutor to carry, and not\n  the tutor to carry him. But (let us say) you will avoid this extreme;\n  he shall be escorted by one who knows the world, not only from\n  books but from his own experience; a man who has been employed\n  on such services, and thrice ’made the tour of Europe with success’–that\n  is, without breaking his own or his pupil’s neck; for if he is\n  such as my eyes have seen, some broken Swiss valet de chambre, some\n  general undertaker, who will perform the journey in so many months,\n  ’if God permit,’ much knowledge will not accrue. Some profit, at\n  least: he will learn the amount to a halfpenny of every stage from\n  Calais to Rome; he will be carried to the best inns, instructed where\n  there is the best wine, and sup a livre cheaper than if the youth had\n  been left to make the tour and the bargain himself. Look at our\n  governor, I beseech you! See, he is an inch taller as he relates the\n  advantages. And here endeth his pride, his knowledge, and his use.\n  But when your son gets abroad he will be taken out of his hand by\n  his society with men of rank and letters, with whom he will pass the\n  greatest part of his time.”",
        "So much for the bear-leader; and now a remark or two on the young\nman’s chances of getting into good foreign society; and then–the\nbenediction:",
        "  “Let me observe, in the first place, that company which is really\n  good is very rare and very shy. But you have surmounted this difficulty,\n  and procured him the best letters of recommendation to the\n  most eminent and respectable in every capital. And I answer that\n  he will obtain all by them which courtesy strictly stands obliged to\n  pay on such occasions, but no more. There is nothing in which we\n  are so much deceived as in the advantages proposed from our connexions\n  and discourse with the literati, &c., in foreign parts, especially\n  if the experiment is made before we are matured by years or\n  study. Conversation is a traffic; and if you enter it without some\n  stock of knowledge to balance the account perpetually betwixt you,\n  the trade drops at once; and this is the reason, however it may be\n  boasted to the contrary, why travellers have so little (especially good)\n  conversation with the natives, owing to their suspicion, or perhaps\n  conviction, that there is nothing to be extracted from the conversation\n  of young itinerants worth the trouble of their bad language, or\n  the interruption of their visits.”",
        "Very true, no doubt, and excellently well put; but we seem to have got\nsome distance, in spirit at any rate, from Luke xv. 13; and it is with\nsomewhat too visible effect, perhaps, that Sterne forces his way\nback into the orthodox routes of pulpit disquisition. The youth,\ndisappointed with his reception by “the literati,” &c., seeks “an\neasier society; and as bad company is always ready, and ever lying in\nwait, the career is soon finished, and the poor prodigal returns–the\nsame object of pity with the prodigal in the Gospel.” Hardly a good\nenough “tag,” perhaps, to reconcile the ear to the “And now to,” &c.,\nas a fitting close to this pointed little essay in the style of the\nChesterfield Letters. There is much internal evidence to show that\nthis so-called sermon was written either after Sterne’s visit to or\nduring his stay in France; and there is strong reason, I think, to\nsuppose that it was in reality neither intended for a sermon nor\nactually delivered from the pulpit.",
        "No other of his sermons has quite so much vivacity as this. But in\nthe famous discourse upon an unlucky text–the sermon preached at\nthe chapel of the English Embassy, in Paris–there are touches of\nunclerical raillery not a few. Thus: “What a noise,” he exclaims,\n\"among the simulants of the various virtues!... Behold Humility,\nbecome so out of mere pride; Chastity, never once in harm’s way; and\nCourage, like a Spanish soldier upon an Italian stage–a bladder full\nof wind. Hush! the sound of that trumpet! Let not my soldier run!’\ntis some good Christian giving alms. O Pity, thou gentlest of human\npassions! soft and tender are thy notes, and ill accord they with so\nloud an instrument.”",
        "Here, again, is a somewhat bold saying for a divine: “But, to avoid\nall commonplace cant as much as I can on this head, I will forbear to\nsay, because I do not think, that ’tis a breach of Christian charity\nto think or speak ill of our neighbour. We cannot avoid it: our\nopinion must follow the evidence,” &c. And a little later on,\ncommenting on the insinuation conveyed in Satan’s question, “Does Job\nserve God for nought?” he says: “It is a bad picture, and done by a\nterrible master; and yet we are always copying it. Does a man from\nreal conviction of heart forsake his vices? The position is not to be\nallowed. No; his vices have forsaken him. Does a pure virgin fear God,\nand say her prayers? She is in her climacteric? Does humility clothe\nand educate the unknown orphan? Poverty, thou hast no genealogies.\nSee! is he not the father of the child?” In another sermon he launches\nout into quaintly contemptuous criticism of a religious movement which\nhe was certainly the last person in the world to understand–to wit,\nMethodism. He asks whether, “when a poor, disconsolated, drooping\ncreature is terrified from all enjoyment, prays without ceasing till\nhis imagination is heated, fasts and mortifies and mopes till his body\nis in as bad a plight as his mind, it is a wonder that the mechanical\ndisturbances and conflicts of an empty belly, interpreted by an empty\nhead, should be mistook for workings of a different kind from what\nthey are?” Other sermons reflect the singularly bitter anti-Catholic\nfeeling which was characteristic even of indifferentism in those\ndays–at any rate amongst Whig divines. But in most of them one is\nliable to come at any moment across one of those strange sallies to\nwhich Gray alluded, when he said of the effect of Sterne’s sermons\nupon a reader that “you often see him tottering on the verge of\nlaughter, and ready to throw his periwig in the face of the audience.”",
        "MEETING WITH WIFE AND DAUGHTER.–RETURN TO\nENGLAND.–\"TRISTRAM SHANDY,” VOL. IX.–\"THE SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY.”",
        "In the first week of October, 1765, or a few days later, Sterne\nset out on what was afterwards to become famous as the “Sentimental\nJourney through France and Italy.” Not, of course, that all the\nmaterials for that celebrated piece of literary travel were collected\non this occasion. From London as far as Lyons his way lay by a route\nwhich he had already traversed three years before, and there is\nreason to believe that at least some of the scenes in the Sentimental\nJourney were drawn from observation made on his former visit. His\nstay in Paris was shorter this year than it had been on the previous\noccasion. A month after leaving England he was at Pont Beauvoisin,\nand by the middle of November he had reached Turin. From this city he\nwrites, with his characteristic simplicity: “I am very happy, and\nhave found my way into a dozen houses already. To-morrow I am to be\npresented to the King, and when that ceremony is over I shall have my\nhands full of engagements.” From Turin he went on, by way of Milan,\nParma, Piacenza, and Bologna, to Florence, where, after three days’\nstay, “to dine with our Plenipo,” he continued his journey to\nRome. Here, and at Naples, he passed the winter of 1765-’66,[1]\nand prolonged his stay in Italy until the ensuing spring was well\nadvanced. In the month of May he was again on his way home, through\nFrance, and had had a meeting, after two years’ separation from them,\nwith his wife and daughter. His account of it to Hall Stevenson is\ncurious: “Never man,” he writes, “has been such a wild-goose chase\nafter his wife as I have been. After having sought her in five or six\ndifferent towns, I found her at last in Franche Comté. Poor woman!\"\nhe adds, “she was very cordial, &c.” The &c. is charming. But\nher cordiality had evidently no tendency to deepen into any more\nimpassioned sentiment, for she “begged to stay another year or so.\"\nAs to “my Lydia\"–the real cause, we must suspect, of Sterne’s having\nturned out of his road–she, he says, “pleases me much. I found her\ngreatly improved in everything I wished her.” As to himself: “I am\nmost unaccountably well, and most accountably nonsensical. ’Tis at\nleast a proof of good spirits, which is a sign and token, in these\nlatter days, that I must take up my pen. In faith, I think I shall\ndie with it in my hand; but I shall live these ten years, my Antony,\nnotwithstanding the fears of my wife, whom I left most melancholy\non that account.” The “fears” and the melancholy were, alas! to be\njustified, rather than the “good spirits;” and the shears of Atropos\nwere to close, not in ten years, but in little more than twenty\nmonths, upon that fragile thread of life.",
        "[Footnote 1: It was on this tour that Sterne picked up the French\nvalet Lafleur, whom he introduced as a character into the Sentimental\nJourney, but whose subsequently published recollections of the tour\n(if, indeed, the veritable Lafleur was the author of the notes from\nwhich Scott quotes so freely) appear, as Mr. Fitzgerald has pointed\nout, from internal evidence to be mostly fictitious.]",
        "By the end of June he was back again in his Yorkshire home, and very\nsoon after had settled down to work upon the ninth and last volume of\nTristram Shandy. He was writing, however, as it should seem,\nunder something more than the usual distractions of a man with two\nestablishments. Mrs. Sterne was just then ill at Marseilles, and her\nhusband–who, to do him justice, was always properly solicitous for\nher material comfort–was busy making provision for her to change her\nquarters to Chalons. He writes to M. Panchaud, at Paris, sending fifty\npounds, and begging him to make her all further advances that might be\nnecessary. “I have,” he says, “such entire confidence in my wife\nthat she spends as little as she can, though she is confined to no\nparticular sum ... and you may rely–in case she should draw for fifty\nor a hundred pounds extraordinary–that it and every demand shall\nbe punctually paid, and with proper thanks; and for this the whole\nShandian family are ready to stand security.” Later on, too, he writes\nthat “a young nobleman is now inaugurating a jaunt with me for six\nweeks, about Christmas, to the Faubourg St. Germain;” and he adds–in\na tone the sincerity of which he would himself have probably found\na difficulty in gauging–\"if my wife should grow worse (having had a\nvery poor account of her in my daughter’s last), I cannot think of her\nbeing without me; and, however expensive the journey would be, I would\nfly to Avignon to administer consolation to her and my poor girl.[1]”",
        "[Footnote 1: There can be few admirers of Sterne’s genius who\nwould not gladly incline, whenever they find it possible, to Mr.\nFitzgerald’s very indulgent estimate of his disposition. But this\nis only one of many instances in which the charity of the\nbiographer appears to me to be, if the expression may be permitted,\nunconscionable. I can, at any rate, find no warrant whatever in the\nabove passage for the too kindly suggestion that “Sterne was actually\nnegotiating a journey to Paris as ’bear-leader’ to a young nobleman\n(an odious office, to which he had special aversion), in order that\nhe might with economy fly over to Avignon.\"]",
        "The necessity for this flight, however, did not arise. Better\naccounts of Mrs. Sterne arrived a few weeks later, and the husband’s\nconsolations were not required.",
        "Meanwhile the idyll of Captain Shandy’s love-making was gradually\napproaching completion; and there are signs to be met with–in\nthe author’s correspondence, that is to say, and not in the work\nitself–that he was somewhat impatient to be done with it, at any rate\nfor the time. “I shall publish,” he says, “late in this year; and the\nnext I shall begin a new work of four volumes, which, when finished,\nI shall continue Tristram with fresh spirit.” The new work in\nfour volumes (not destined to get beyond one) was, of course, the\nSentimental Journey. His ninth volume of Tristram Shandy was\nfinished by the end of the year, and at Christmas he came up to\nLondon, after his usual practice, to see to its publication and enjoy\nthe honours of its reception. The book passed duly through the press,\nand in the last days of January was issued the announcement of its\nimmediate appearance. Of the character of its welcome I can find no\nother evidence than that of Sterne himself, in a letter addressed to\nM. Panchaud some fortnight after the book appeared. “’Tis liked the\nbest of all here;” but, with whatever accuracy this may have expressed\nthe complimentary opinion of friends, or even the well-considered\njudgment of critics, one can hardly believe that it enjoyed anything\nlike the vogue of the former volumes. Sterne, however, would be the\nless concerned for this, that his head was at the moment full of\nhis new venture. “I am going,” he writes, “to publish A Sentimental\nJourney through France and Italy. The undertaking is protected and\nhighly encouraged by all our noblesse. ’Tis subscribed for at a great\nrate ’twill be an original, in large quarto, the subscription half a\nguinea. If you (Panchaud) can procure me the honour of a few names of\nmen of science or fashion, I shall thank you: they will appear in good\ncompany, as all the nobility here have honoured me with their names.\"\nAs was usual with him, however, he postponed commencing it until he\nshould have returned to Coxwold; and, as was equally usual with\nhim, he found it difficult to tear himself away from the delights\nof London. Moreover, there was in the present instance a special\ndifficulty, arising out of an affair upon which, as it has relations\nwith the history of Sterne’s literary work, it would be impossible,\neven in the most strictly critical and least general of biographies,\nto observe complete silence. I refer, of course, to the famous and\nfurious flirtation with Mrs. Draper–the Eliza of the Yorick and Eliza\nLetters. Of the affair itself but little need be said. I have already\nstated my own views on the general subject of Sterne’s love affairs;\nand I feel no inducement to discuss the question of their innocence\nor otherwise in relation to this particular amourette. I will only\nsay that were it technically as innocent as you please, the mean\nwhich must be found between Thackeray’s somewhat too harsh and Mr.\nFitzgerald’s considerably too indulgent judgment on it will lie,\nit seems to me, decidedly nearer to the former than to the latter’s\nextreme. This episode of violently sentimental philandering with an\nIndian “grass widow” was, in any case, an extremely unlovely passage\nin Sterne’s life. On the best and most charitable view of it, the\nflirtation, pursued in the way it was, and to the lengths to which\nit was carried, must be held to convict the elderly lover of the most\ndeplorable levity, vanity, indiscretion, and sickly sentimentalism. It\nwas, to say the least of it, most unbecoming in a man of Sterne’s age\nand profession; and when it is added that Yorick’s attentions to Eliza\nwere paid in so open a fashion as to be brought by gossip to the ears\nof his neglected wife, then living many hundred miles away from him,\nits highly reprehensible character seems manifest enough in all ways.",
        "No sooner, however, had the fascinating widow set sail, than the\nsentimental lover began to feel so strongly the need of a female\nconsoler, that his heart seems to have softened, insensibly, even\ntowards his wife. “I am unhappy,” he writes plaintively to Lydia\nSterne. “Thy mother and thyself at a distance from me–and what can\ncompensate for such a destitution? For God’s sake persuade her to come\nand fix in England! for life is too short to waste in separation;\nand while she lives in one country and I in another, many people will\nsuppose it proceeds from choice\"–a supposition, he seems to imply,\nwhich even my scrupulously discreet conduct in her absence scarcely\nsuffices to refute. “Besides\"–a word in which there is here almost\nas much virtue as in an “if\"–\"I want thee near me, thou child and\ndarling of my heart. I am in a melancholy mood, and my Lydia’s eyes\nwill smart with weeping when I tell her the cause that just now\naffects me.” And then his sensibilities brim over, and into his\ndaughter’s ear he pours forth his lamentations over the loss of her\nmother’s rival. “I am apprehensive the dear friend I mentioned in my\nlast letter is going into a decline. I was with her two days ago, and\nI never beheld a being so altered. She has a tender frame, and looks\nlike a drooping lily, for the roses are fled from her cheeks. I can\nnever see or talk to this incomparable woman without bursting into\ntears. I have a thousand obligations to her, and I love her more than\nher whole sex, if not all the world put together. She has a delicacy,\"\n&c., &c. And after reciting a frigid epitaph which he had written,\n\"expressive of her modest worth,” he winds up with–\"Say all that is\nkind of me to thy mother; and believe me, my Lydia, that I love\nthee most truly.” My excuse for quoting thus fully from this most\ncharacteristic letter, and, indeed, for dwelling at all upon these\nclosing incidents of the Yorick and Eliza episode, is, that in their\nstriking illustration of the soft, weak, spiritually self-indulgent\nnature of the man, they assist us, far more than many pages of\ncriticism would do, to understand one particular aspect of his\nliterary idiosyncrasy. The sentimentalist of real life explains the\nsentimentalist in art.",
        "In the early days of May Sterne managed at last to tear himself away\nfrom London and its joys, and with painful slowness, for he was now in\na wretched state of health, to make his way back to Yorkshire. “I have\ngot conveyed,” he says in a distressing letter from Newark to Hall\nStevenson–\"I have got conveyed thus far like a bale of cadaverous\ngoods consigned to Pluto and Company, lying in the bottom of my chaise\nmost of the route, upon a large pillow which I had the prévoyance to\npurchase before I set out. I am worn out, but pass on to Barnby Moor\nto-night, and if possible to York the next. I know not what is the\nmatter with me, but some derangement presses hard upon this machine.\nStill, I think it will not be overset this bout\"–another of those\nutterances of a cheerful courage under the prostration of pain which\nreveal to us the manliest side of Sterne’s nature. On reaching Coxwold\nhis health appears to have temporarily mended, and in June we find him\ngiving a far better account of himself to another of his friends. The\nfresh Yorkshire air seems to have temporarily revived him, and to his\nfriend, Arthur Lee, a young American, he writes thus: “I am as happy\nas a prince at Coxwold, and I wish you could see in how princely a\nmanner I live. ’Tis a land of plenty. I sit down alone to dinner–fish\nand wild-fowl, or a couple of fowls or ducks, with cream and all the\nsimple plenty which a rich valley under Hamilton Hills can produce,\nwith a clean cloth on my table, and a bottle of wine on my right hand\nto drink your health. I have a hundred hens and chickens about my\nyard; and not a parishioner catches a hare, a rabbit, or a trout but\nhe brings it as an offering to me.” Another of his correspondents at\nthis period was the Mrs. H. of his letters, whose identity I have been\nunable to trace, but who is addressed in a manner which seems to show\nSterne’s anxiety to expel the old flame of Eliza’s kindling by a new\none. There is little, indeed, of the sentimentalizing strain in which\nhe was wont to sigh at the feet of Mrs. Draper, but in its place\nthere is a freedom of a very prominent, and here and there of a highly\nunpleasant, kind. To his friends, Mr. and Mrs. James, too, he writes\nfrequently during this year, chiefly to pour out his soul on the\nsubject of Eliza; and Mrs. James, who is always addressed in company\nwith her husband, enjoys the almost unique distinction of being the\nonly woman outside his own family circle whom Sterne never approaches\nin the language of artificial gallantry, but always in that of simple\nfriendship and respect.[1] Meanwhile, however, the Sentimental\nJourney was advancing at a reasonable rate of speed towards\ncompletion. In July he writes of himself as “now beginning to be truly\nbusy” on it, “the pain and sorrows of this life having retarded its\nprogress.”",
        "[Footnote 1: To this period of Sterne’s life, it may here be remarked,\nis to be assigned the dog-Latin letter (\"and very sad dog-Latin too”)\nso justly animadverted upon by Thackeray, and containing a passage\nof which Madame de Medalle, it is to be charitably hoped, had no\nsuspicion of the meaning. Mr. Fitzgerald, through an oversight in\ntranslation, and understanding Sterne to say that he himself, and\nnot his correspondent, Hall Stevenson, was “quadraginta et plus annos\nnatus,” has referred it to an earlier date. The point, however, is of\nno great importance, as the untranslatable passage in the letter would\nbe little less unseemly in 1754 or 1755 than in 1768, at the beginning\nof which year, since the letter is addressed from London to Hall\nStevenson, then in Yorkshire, it must, in fact, have been written.]",
        "His wife and daughter were about to rejoin him in the autumn, and he\nlooked forward to settling them at a hired house in York before going\nup to town to publish his new volumes. On the 1st of October the two\nladies arrived at York, and the next day the reunited family went on\nto Coxwold. The meeting with the daughter gave Sterne one of the\nfew quite innocent pleasures which he was capable of feeling; and\nhe writes next day to Mr. and Mrs. James in terms of high pride\nand satisfaction of his recovered child. “My girl has returned,\"\nhe writes, in the language of playful affection, “an elegant,\naccomplished little slut. My wife–but I hate,” he adds, with\nremarkable presence of mind, “to praise my wife. ’Tis as much as\ndecency will allow to praise my daughter. I suppose,” he concludes,\n\"they will return next summer to France. They leave me in a month to\nreside at York for the winter, and I stay at Coxwold till the 1st\nof January.” This seems to indicate a little longer delay in the\npublication of the Sentimental Journey than he had at first\nintended; for it seems that the book was finished by the end of\nNovember. On the 28th of that month he writes to the Earl of –– (as\nhis daughter’s foolish mysteriousness has headed the letter), to thank\nhim for his letter of inquiry about Yorick, and to say that Yorick\n\"has worn out both his spirits and body with the Sentimental\nJourney. ’Tis true that an author must feel himself, or his reader\nwill not” (how mistaken a devotion Sterne showed to this Horatian\ncanon will be noted hereafter), “but I have torn my whole frame into\npieces by my feelings. I believe the brain stands as much in need of\nrecruiting as the body; therefore I shall set out for town the 20th of\nnext month, after having recruited myself at York.” Then he adds the\nstrange observation, “I might, indeed, solace myself with my wife (who\nis come from France), but, in fact, I have long been a sentimental\nbeing, whatever your Lordship may think to the contrary. The world\nhas imagined because I wrote Tristram Shandy that I was myself more\nShandian than I really ever was. ’Tis a good-natured world we live\nin, and we are often painted in divers colours, according to the ideas\neach one frames in his head.” It would, perhaps, have been scarcely\npossible for Sterne to state his essentially unhealthy philosophy of\nlife so concisely as in this naïve passage. The connubial affections\nare here, in all seriousness and good faith apparently, opposed to\nthe sentimental emotions–as the lower to the higher. To indulge the\nformer is to be “Shandian,” that is to say, coarse and carnal; to\ndevote oneself to the latter, or, in other words, to spend one’s\ndays in semi-erotic languishings over the whole female sex\nindiscriminately, is to show spirituality and taste.",
        "Meanwhile, however, that fragile abode of sentimentalism–that frame\nwhich had just been “torn to pieces” by the feelings–was becoming\nweaker than its owner supposed. Much of the exhaustion which Sterne\nhad attributed to the violence of his literary emotions was no doubt\ndue to the rapid decline of bodily powers which, unknown to him, were\nalready within a few months of their final collapse. He did not set\nout for London on the 20th of December, as he had promised himself,\nfor on that day he was only just recovering from “an attack of fever\nand bleeding at the lungs,” which had confined him to his room for\nnearly three weeks. “I am worn down to a shadow,” he writes on the\n23rd, “but as my fever has left me, I set off the latter end of next\nweek with my friend, Mr. Hall, for town.” His home affairs had already\nbeen settled. Early in December it had been arranged that his wife\nand daughter should only remain at York during the winter, and should\nreturn to the Continent in the spring. “Mrs. Sterne’s health,” he\nwrites, “is insupportable in England. She must return to France, and\njustice and humanity forbid me to oppose it.” But separation from his\nwife meant separation from his daughter; it was this, of course, which\nwas the really painful parting, and it is to the credit of Sterne’s\ndisinterestedness of affection for Lydia, that in his then state\nof health he brought himself to consent to her leaving him. But he\nrecognized that it was for the advantage of her prospect of settling\nherself in life that she should go with her mother, who seemed\n\"inclined to establish her in France, where she has had many\nadvantageous offers.” Nevertheless “his heart bled,” as he wrote to\nLee, when he thought of parting with his child. “’Twill be like the\nseparation of soul and body, and equal to nothing but what passes at\nthat tremendous moment; and like it in one respect, for she will be in\none kingdom while I am in another.” Thus was this matter settled, and\nby the 1st of January Sterne had arrived in London for the last time,\nwith the two volumes of the Sentimental Journey. He took up his\nquarters at the lodgings in Bond Street (No. 41), which he had\noccupied during his stay in town the previous year, and entered at\nonce upon the arrangements for publication. These occupied two full\nmonths, and on the 27th of February the last work, as it was destined\nto be, of the Rev. Mr. Yorick was issued to the world.",
        "Its success would seem to have been immediate, and was certainly great\nand lasting. In one sense, indeed, it was far greater than had been,\nor than has since been, attained by Tristram Shandy. The compliments\nwhich courteous Frenchmen had paid the author upon his former work,\nand which his simple vanity had swallowed whole and unseasoned,\nwithout the much-needed grain of salt, might, no doubt, have been\nrepeated to him with far greater sincerity as regards the Sentimental\nJourney, had he lived to receive them. Had any Frenchman told him a\nyear or two afterwards that the latter work was “almost as much known\nin Paris as in London, at least among men of condition and learning,\"\nhe would very likely have been telling him no more than the truth. The\nSentimental Journey certainly acquired what Tristram Shandy never\ndid–a European reputation. It has been translated into Italian,\nGerman, Dutch, and even Polish; and into French again and again.\nThe French, indeed, have no doubt whatever of its being Sterne’s\nchef-d’oeuvre; and one has only to compare a French translation of\nit with a rendering of Tristram Shandy into the same language to\nunderstand, and from our neighbours’ point of view even to admit, the\njustice of their preference. The charms of the Journey, its grace,\nwit, and urbanity, are thoroughly congenial to that most graceful of\nlanguages, and reproduce themselves readily enough therein; while,\non the other hand, the fantastic digressions, the elaborate\nmystifications, the farcical interludes of the earlier work, appear\nintolerably awkward and bizzare in their French dress; and, what\nis much more strange, even the point of the double entendres is\nsometimes unaccountably lost. Were it not that the genuine humour of\nTristram Shandy in a great measure evaporates in translation, one\nwould be forced to admit that the work which is the more catholic\nin its appeal to appreciation is the better of the two. But, having\nregard to this disappearance of genuine and unquestionable excellences\nin the process of translation, I see no good reason why those\nEnglishmen–the great majority, I imagine–who prefer Tristram\nShandy to the Sentimental Journey should feel any misgivings as to\nthe soundness of their taste. The humour which goes the deepest\ndown beneath the surface of things is the most likely to become\ninextricably interwoven with those deeper fibres of associations which\nlie at the roots of a language; and it may well happen, therefore,\nthough from the cosmopolitan point of view it is a melancholy\nreflection, that the merit of a book, to those who use the language\nin which it is written, bears a direct ratio to the persistence of its\nrefusal to yield up its charm to men of another tongue.",
        "The favour, however, with which the Sentimental Journey was received\nabroad, and which it still enjoys (the last French translation is\nvery recent), is, as Mr. Fitzgerald says, “worthily merited, if grace,\nnature, true sentiment, and exquisite dramatic power be qualities that\nare to find a welcome. And apart,” he adds, “from these attractions\nit has a unique charm of its own, a flavour, so to speak, a fragrance\nthat belongs to that one book alone. Never was there such a charming\nseries of complete little pictures, which for delicacy seem like the\nseries of medallions done on Sèvres china which we sometimes see in\nold French cabinets.... The figures stand out brightly, and in what\nnumber and variety! Old Calais, with its old inn; M. Dessein, the\nmonk, one of the most artistic figures on literary canvas; the\ncharming French lady whom M. Dessein shut into the carriage with the\ntraveller; the débonnaire French captain, and the English travellers\nreturning, touched in with only a couple of strokes; La Fleur, the\nvalet; the pretty French glove-seller, whose pulse the Sentimental one\nfelt; her husband, who passed through the shop and pulled off his hat\nto Monsieur for the honour he was doing him; the little maid in the\nbookseller’s shop, who put her little present à part; the charming\nGreuze ’grisset,’ who sold him the ruffles; the reduced chevalier\nselling patés; the groups of beggars at Montreuil; the fadeCount de Bissie, who read Shakespeare; and the crowd of minor\ncroquis–postilions, landlords, notaries, soldiers, abbés,\nprécieuses, maids–merely touched, but touched with wonderful art,\nmake up a surprising collection of distinct and graphic characters.”",
        "(1768.)",
        "The end was now fast approaching. Months before, Sterne had written\ndoubtfully of his being able to stand another winter in England, and\nhis doubts were to be fatally justified. One can easily see, however,\nhow the unhappy experiment came to be tried. It is possible that he\nmight have delayed the publication of his book for a while, and taken\nrefuge abroad from the rigours of the two remaining winter months,\nhad it not been in the nature of his malady to conceal its deadly\napproaches. Consumption sported with its victim in the cruel fashion\nthat is its wont. “I continue to mend,” Sterne writes from Bond Street\non the first day of the new year, “and doubt not but this with all\nother evils and uncertainties of life will end for the best.” And\nfor the best perhaps it did end, in the sense in which the resigned\nChristian uses these pious words; but this, one fears, was not the\nsense intended by the dying man. All through January and February he\nwas occupied not only with business, but as it would seem with a fair\namount, though less, no doubt, than his usual share, of pleasure also.\nVastly active was he, it seems, in the great undertaking of obtaining\ntickets for one of Mrs. Cornely’s entertainments–the “thing” to go to\nat that particular time–for his friends the Jameses. He writes them\non Monday that he has not been a moment at rest since writing the\nprevious day about the Soho ticket. “I have been at a Secretary of\nState to get one, have been upon one knee to my friend Sir George\nMacartney, Mr. Lascelles, and Mr. Fitzmaurice, without mentioning\nfive more. I believe I could as soon get you a place at Court, for\neverybody is going; but I will go out and try a new circle, and if\nyou do not hear from me by a quarter to three, you may conclude I\nhave been unfortunate in my supplications.” Whether he was or was not\nunfortunate history does not record. A week or two later the old round\nof dissipation had apparently set in. “I am now tied down neck and\nheels by engagements every night this week, or most joyfully would\nhave trod the old pleasing road from Bond to Gerrard Street. I am\nquite well, but exhausted with a roomful of company every morning till\ndinner.” A little later, and this momentary flash of health had died\nout; and we find him writing what was his last letter to his daughter,\nfull, evidently, of uneasy forebodings as to his approaching end. He\nspeaks of “this vile influenza–be not alarmed. I think I shall get\nthe better of it, and shall be with you both the 1st of May;\"\nthough, he adds, “if I escape, ’twill not be for a long period, my\nchild–unless a quiet retreat and peace of mind can restore me.” But\nthe occasion of this letter was a curious one, and a little more must\nbe extracted from it. Lydia Sterne’s letter to her father had, he\nsaid, astonished him. “She (Mrs. Sterne) could know but little of my\nfeelings to tell thee that under the supposition I should survive\nthy mother I should bequeath thee as a legacy to Mrs. Draper. No, my\nLydia, ’tis a lady whose virtues I wish thee to imitate\"–Mrs.\nJames, in fact, whom he proceeds to praise with much and probably\nwell-deserved warmth. “But,” he adds, sadly, “I think, my Lydia,\nthy mother will survive me; do not deject her spirit with thy\napprehensions on my account. I have sent you a necklace and buckles,\nand the same to your mother. My girl cannot form a wish that is in the\npower of her father that he will not gratify her in; and I cannot in\njustice be less kind to thy mother. I am never alone. The kindness of\nmy friends is ever the same. I wish though I had thee to nurse me, but\nI am denied that. Write to me twice a week at least. God bless thee,\nmy child, and believe me ever, ever, thy affectionate father.”",
        "The despondent tone of this letter was to be only too soon justified.\nThe “vile influenza” proved to be or became a pleurisy. On Thursday,\nMarch 10, he was bled three times, and blistered on the day after.

        "  “From your affectionate friend,                       L. STERNE.”",
        "This pathetic death-bed letter is superscribed “Tuesday.” It seems to\nhave been written on Tuesday, the 15th of March, and three days later\nthe writer breathed his last. But two persons, strangers both, were\npresent at his deathbed, and it is by a singularly fortunate chance,\ntherefore, that one of these–and he not belonging to the class of\npeople who usually leave behind them published records of the events\nof their lives–should have preserved for us an account of the closing\nscene. This, however, is to be found in the Memoirs of John Macdonald,\n\"a cadet of the house of Keppoch,” at that time footman to Mr.\nCrawford, a fashionable friend of Sterne’s. His master had taken a\nhouse in Clifford Street in the spring of 1768; and “about this time,\"\nhe writes, “Mr. Sterne, the celebrated author, was taken ill at the\nsilk-bag shop in Old Bond Street. He was sometimes called Tristram\nShandy and sometimes Yorick, a very great favourite of the gentlemen.\nOne day\"–namely, on the aforesaid 18th of March–\"my master had\ncompany to dinner who were speaking about him–the Duke of Roxburghe,\nthe Earl of March, the Earl of Ossory, the Duke of Grafton, Mr.\nGarrick, Mr. Hume, and a Mr. James.” Many, if not most, of the party,\ntherefore, were personal friends of the man who lay dying in the\nstreet hard by, and naturally enough the conversation turned on his\ncondition. “’John,’ said my master,” the narrative continues, “’go and\ninquire how Mr. Sterne is to-day.’” Macdonald did so; and, in language\nwhich seems to bear the stamp of truth upon it, he thus records the\ngrim story which he had to report to the assembled guests on his\nreturn: “I went to Mr. Sterne’s lodgings; the mistress opened the\ndoor. I enquired how he did; she told me to go up to the nurse. I went\ninto the room, and he was just a-dying. I waited ten minutes; but in\nfive he said, ’Now it is come.’ He put up his hand as if to stop a\nblow, and died in a minute. The gentlemen were all very sorry, and\nlamented him very much.”",
        "Thus, supported by a hired nurse, and under the curious eyes of a\nstranger, Sterne breathed his last. His wife and daughter were far\naway; the convivial associates “who were all very sorry and lamented\nhim very much,” were for the moment represented only by “John;” and\nthe shocking tradition goes that the alien hands by which the “dying\neyes were closed,” and the “decent limbs composed,” remunerated\nthemselves for the pious office by abstracting the gold sleeve-links\nfrom the dead man’s wrists. One may hope, indeed, that this last\ncircumstance is to be rejected as sensational legend, but even without\nit the story of Sterne’s death seems sad enough, no doubt. Yet it is,\nafter all, only by contrast with the excited gaiety of his daily\nlife in London that his end appears so forlorn. From many a “set of\nresidential chambers,” from many of the old and silent inns of the\nlawyers, departures as lonely, or lonelier, are being made around us\nin London every year: the departures of men not necessarily kinless or\nfriendless, but living solitary lives, and dying before their friends\nor kindred can be summoned to their bedsides. Such deaths, no doubt,\nare often contrasted in conventional pathos with that of the husband\nand father surrounded by a weeping wife and children; but the more\nsensible among us construct no tragedy out of a mode of exit which\nmust have many times entered as at least a possibility into the\nprevious contemplation of the dying man. And except, as has been\nsaid, that Sterne associates himself in our minds with the perpetual\nexcitements of lively companionship, there would be nothing\nparticularly melancholy in his end. This is subject, of course, to\nthe assumption that the story of his landlady having stolen the gold\nsleeve-links from his dead body may be treated as mythical; and,\nrejecting this story, there seems no good reason for making much ado\nabout the manner of his death. Of friends, as distinguished from mere\ndinner-table acquaintances, he seems to have had but few in London:\nwith the exception of the Jameses, one knows not with certainty\nof any; and the Jameses do not appear to have neglected him in the\nillness which neither they nor he suspected to be his last. Mr. James\nhad paid him a visit but a day or two before the end came; and it may\nvery likely have been upon his report of his friend’s condition that\nthe message of inquiry was sent from the dinner table at which he was\na guest. No doubt Sterne’s flourish in Tristram Shandy about his\npreferring to die at an inn, untroubled by the spectacle of “the\nconcern of my friends, and the last services of wiping my brows\nand smoothing my pillow,” was a mere piece of bravado; and the more\nprobably so because the reflection is appropriated almost bodily from\nBishop Burnet, who quotes it as a frequent observation of Archbishop\nLeighton. But, considering that Sterne was in the habit of passing\nnearly half of each year alone in London lodgings, the realization of\nhis wish does not strike me, I confess, as so dramatically impressive\na coincidence as it is sometimes represented.",
        "According, however, to one strange story the dramatic element gives\nplace after Sterne’s very burial to melodrama of the darkest kind. The\nfuneral, which pointed, after all, a far sadder moral than the death,\ntook place on Tuesday, March 22, attended by only two mourners, one of\nwhom is said to have been his publisher Becket, and the other probably\nMr. James; and, thus duly neglected by the whole crowd of boon\ncompanions, the remains of Yorick were consigned to the “new\nburying-ground near Tyburn” of the parish of St. George’s, Hanover\nSquare. In that now squalid and long-decayed grave-yard, within sight\nof the Marble Arch and over against the broad expanse of Hyde Park,\nis still to be found a tombstone inscribed with some inferior lines to\nthe memory of the departed humourist, and with a statement, inaccurate\nby eight months, of the date of his death, and a year out as to his\nage. Dying, as has been seen, on the 18th of March, 1768, at the age\nof fifty-four, he is declared on this slab to have died on the 13th of\nNovember, aged fifty-three years. There is more excuse, however, for\nthis want of veracity than sepulchral inscriptions can usually plead.\nThe stone was erected by the pious hands of “two brother Masons,” many\nyears, it is said, after the event which it purports to record; and\nfrom the wording of the epitaph which commences, “Near this place\nlyes the body,” &c., it obviously does not profess to indicate–what,\ndoubtless, there was no longer any means of tracing–the exact spot in\nwhich Sterne’s remains were laid. But, wherever the grave really was,\nthe body interred in it, according to the strange story to which I\nhave referred, is no longer there. That story goes: that two days\nafter the burial, on the night of the 24th of March, the corpse was\nstolen by body-snatchers, and by them disposed of to M. Collignon,\nProfessor of Anatomy at Cambridge; that the Professor invited a few\nscientific friends to witness a demonstration, and that among these\nwas one who had been acquainted with Sterne, and who fainted with\nhorror on recognizing in the already partially dissected “subject” the\nfeatures of his friend. So, at least, this very gruesome and Poe-like\nlegend runs; but it must be confessed that all the evidence which\nMr. Fitzgerald has been able to collect in its favour is of the very\nloosest and vaguest description. On the other hand, it is, of course,\nonly fair to recollect that, in days when respectable surgeons and\ngrave scientific professors had to depend upon the assistance of\nlaw-breakers for the prosecution of their studies and teachings, every\neffort would naturally be made to hush up any such unfortunate affair.\nThere is, moreover, independent evidence to the fact that similar\ndesecrations of this grave-yard had of late been very common; and\nthat at least one previous attempt to check the operations of the\n\"resurrection-men” had been attended with peculiarly infelicitous\nresults. In the St. James’s Chronicle for November 26, 1767, we find\nit recorded that “the Burying Ground in Oxford Road, belonging to the\nParish of St. George’s, Hanover Square, having been lately robbed of\nseveral dead bodies, a Watcher was placed there, attended by a\nlarge mastiff Dog; notwithstanding which, on Sunday night last, some\nVillains found means to steal out another dead Body, and carried off\nthe very Dog.” Body-snatchers so adroit and determined as to contrive\nto make additional profit out of the actual means taken to prevent\ntheir depredations, would certainly not have been deterred by any\nconsiderations of prudence from attempting the theft of Sterne’s\ncorpse. There was no such ceremony about his funeral as would lead\nthem to suppose that the deceased was a person of any importance,\nor one whose body could not be stolen without a risk of creating\nundesirable excitement. On the whole, therefore, it is impossible\nto reject the body-snatching story as certainly fabulous, though\nits truth is far from being proved; and though I can scarcely myself\nsubscribe to Mr. Fitzgerald’s view, that there is a “grim and lurid\nShandyism” about the scene of dissection, yet if others discover an\nappeal to their sense of humour in the idea of Sterne’s body being\ndissected after death, I see nothing to prevent them from holding that\nhypothesis as a “pious opinion.”",
        "THE CHARGE OF PLAGIARISM.–DR. FERRIAR’S\n\"ILLUSTRATIONS.”",
        "Everyday experience suffices to show that the qualities which win\nenduring fame for books and for their authors are not always those\nto which they owe their first popularity. It may with the utmost\nprobability be affirmed that this was the case with Tristram Shandyand with Sterne. We cannot, it is true, altogether dissociate the\npermanent attractions of the novel from those characteristics of it\nwhich have long since ceased to attract at all; the two are united in\na greater or less degree throughout the work; and this being so, it\nis, of course, impossible to prove to demonstration that it was the\nlatter qualities, and not the former, which procured it its immediate\nvogue. But, as it happens, it is possible to show that what may be\ncalled its spurious attractions varied directly, and its real merits\ninversely, as its popularity with the public of its day. In the\nhigher qualities of humour, in dramatic vigour, in skilful and subtle\ndelineation of character, the novel showed no deterioration, but, in\nsome instances, a marked improvement, as it proceeded; yet the second\ninstalment was not more popular, and most of the succeeding ones\nwere distinctly less popular, than the first. They had gained in many\nqualities, while they had lost in only the single one of novelty; and\nwe may infer, therefore, with approximate certainty, that what “took\nthe town” in the first instance was, that quality of the book which\nwas strangest at its first appearance. The mass of the public read,\nand enjoyed, or thought they enjoyed, when they were really\nonly puzzled and perplexed. The wild digressions, the audacious\nimpertinences, the burlesque philosophizing, the broad jests, the\nair of recondite learning, all combined to make the book a nine\ndays’ wonder; and a majority of its readers would probably have been\nprepared to pronounce Tristram Shandy a work as original in scheme\nand conception as it was eccentric. Some there were, no doubt, who\nperceived the influence of Rabelais in the incessant digressions and\nthe burlesque of philosophy; others, it may be, found a reminder of\nBurton in the parade of learning; and yet a few others, the scattered\nstudents of French facetiae of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,\nmay have read the broad jests with a feeling that they had “seen\nsomething like it before.” But no single reader, no single critic of\nthe time, appears to have combined the knowledge necessary for tracing\nthese three characteristics of the novel to their respective sources;\nand none certainly had any suspicion of the extent to which the\nbooks and authors from whom they were imitated had been laid under\ncontribution. No one suspected that Sterne, not content with borrowing\nhis trick of rambling from Rabelais, and his airs of erudition from\nBurton, and his fooleries from Bruscambille, had coolly transferred\nwhole passages from the second of these writers, not only without\nacknowledgment, but with the intention, obviously indicated by his\nmode of procedure, of passing them off as his own. Nay, it was not\ntill full fifty years afterwards that these daring robberies were\ndetected, or, at any rate, revealed to the world; and, with an irony\nwhich Sterne himself would have appreciated, it was reserved for a\nsincere admirer of the humourist to play the part of detective. In\n1812 Dr. John Ferriar published his Illustrations of Sterne, and\nthe prefatory sonnet, in which he solicits pardon for his too minute\ninvestigations, is sufficient proof of the curiously reverent spirit\nin which he set about his damaging task:",
        "  “Sterne, for whose sake I plod through miry ways\n  Of antic wit, and quibbling mazes drear,\n  Let not thy shade malignant censure fear,\n  If aught of inward mirth my search betrays.\n  Long slept that mirth in dust of ancient days,\n  Erewhile to Guise or wanton Valois dear,” &c.",
        "Thus commences Dr. Ferriar’s apology, which, however, can hardly\nbe held to cover his offence; for, as a matter of fact, Sterne’s\nborrowings extend to a good deal besides “mirth;” and some of the\nmost unscrupulous of these forced loans are raised from passages of a\nperfectly serious import in the originals from which they are taken.",
        "Here, however, is the list of authors to whom Dr. Ferriar holds Sterne\nto have been more or less indebted: Rabelais, Beroalde de Verville,\nBouchet, Bruscambille, Scarron, Swift, an author of the name or\npseudonym of “Gabriel John,” Burton, Bacon, Blount, Montaigne, Bishop\nHall. The catalogue is a reasonably long one; but it is not, of\ncourse, to be supposed that Sterne helped himself equally freely from\nevery author named in it. His obligations to some of them are, as Dr.\nFerriar admits, but slight. From Rabelais, besides his vagaries of\nnarrative, Sterne took, no doubt, the idea of the Tristra-paedia(by descent from the “education of Pantagruel,” through “Martinus\nScriblerus”); but though he has appropriated bodily the passage in\nwhich Friar John attributes the beauty of his nose to the pectoral\nconformation of his nurse, he may be said to have constructively\nacknowledged the debt in a reference to one of the characters in the\nRabelaisian dialogue.[1]",
        "[Footnote 1: “There is no cause but one,” said my Uncle Toby, “why\none man’s nose is longer than another, but because that God pleases to\nhave it so.” “That is Grangousier’s solution,” said my father. “’Tis\nHe,” continued my Uncle Toby, “who makes us all, and frames and puts\nus together in such forms ... and for such ends as is agreeable to\nHis infinite wisdom.\"–Tristram Shandy, vol. iii. c. 41. “Par ce,\nrépondit Grangousier, qu’ainsi Dieu l’a voulu, lequel nous fait en\ncette forme et cette fin selon divin arbitre.\"–Rabelais, book i. c.\n41. In another place, however (vol. viii. c. 3), Sterne has borrowed a\nwhole passage from this French humourist without any acknowledgment at\nall.]",
        "Upon Beroalde, again, upon D’Aubigné, and upon Bouchet he has made no\ndirect and verbatim depredations. From Bruscambille he seems to have\ntaken little or nothing but the not very valuable idea of the tedious\nbuffoonery of vol. iii. c. 30, et sqq.; and to Scarron he, perhaps,\nowed the incident of the dwarf at the theatre in the Sentimental\nJourney, an incident which, it must be owned, he vastly improved in\nthe taking. All this, however, does not amount to very much, and it\nis only when we come to Dr. Ferriar’s collations of Tristram Shandywith the Anatomy of Melancholy that we begin to understand what\nfeats Sterne was capable of as a plagiarist. He must, to begin with,\nhave relied with cynical confidence on the conviction that famous\nwriters are talked about and not read, for he sets to work with the\nscissors upon Burton’s first page:",
        "“Man, the most excellent and noble creature of the world, the\nprincipal and mighty work of God; wonder of nature, as Zoroaster calls\nhim; audacis naturae miraculum, the marvel of marvels, as Plato; the\nabridgment and epitome of the world, as Pliny,” &c. Thus Burton; and,\nwith a few additions of his own, and the substitution of Aristotle for\nPlato as the author of one of the descriptions, thus Sterne: “Who made\nMAN with powers which dart him from heaven to earth in a moment–that\ngreat, that most excellent and noble creature of the world, the\nmiracle of nature, as Zoroaster, in his book [Greek: peri phuseos],\ncalled him–the Shekinah of the Divine Presence, as Chrysostom–the\nimage of God, as Moses–the ray of Divinity, as Plato–the marvel\nof marvels, as Aristotle,” &c.[1] And in the same chapter, in the\n\"Fragment upon Whiskers,” Sterne relates how a “decayed kinsman\"\nof the Lady Baussiere “ran begging, bareheaded, on one side of her\npalfrey, conjuring her by the former bonds of friendship, alliance,\nconsanguinity, &c.–cousin, aunt, sister, mother–for virtue’s sake,\nfor your own sake, for mine, for Christ’s sake, remember me! pity me!\"\nAnd again he tells how a “devout, venerable, hoary-headed man” thus\nbeseeched her: “’I beg for the unfortunate. Good my lady, ’tis for\na prison–for an hospital; ’tis for an old man–a poor man undone by\nshipwreck, by suretyship, by fire. I call God and all His angels to\nwitness, ’tis to clothe the naked, to feed the hungry–’tis to comfort\nthe sick and the brokenhearted.’ The Lady Baussiere rode on.[2]”",
        "[Footnote 1: Tristram Shandy, vol. v.c. 1.]",
        "[Footnote 2: Ibid.]",
        "But now compare this passage from the Anatomy of Melancholy:",
        "  “A poor decayed kinsman of his sets upon him by the way, in all\n  his jollity, and runs begging, bareheaded, by him, conjuring him by\n  those former bonds of friendship, alliance, consanguinity, &c., ’uncle,\n  cousin, brother, father, show some pity for Christ’s sake, pity a\n  sick man, an old man,’ &c.; he cares not–ride on: pretend sickness,\n  inevitable loss of limbs, plead suretyship or shipwreck, fire,\n  common calamities, show thy wants and imperfections, take God\n  and all His angels to witness ... put up a supplication to him in\n  the name of a thousand orphans, an hospital, a spittle, a prison, as\n  he goes by  ... ride on.\"[1]",
        "[Footnote 1: Burton: Anat. Mel., p. 269.]",
        "Hardly a casual coincidence this. But it is yet more unpleasant to\nfind that the mock philosophic reflections with which Mr. Shandy\nconsoles himself on Bobby’s death, in those delightful chapters on\nthat event, are not taken, as they profess to be, direct from the\nsages of antiquity, but have been conveyed through, and “conveyed\"\nfrom, Burton.",
        "“When Agrippina was told of her son’s death,” says Sterne, “Tacitus\ninforms us that, not being able to moderate her passions, she abruptly\nbroke off her work.” Tacitus does, it is true, inform us of this. But\nit was undoubtedly Burton (_Anat. Mel., p. 213) who informed Sterne\nof it. So, too, when Mr. Shandy goes on to remark upon death that\n\"’Tis an inevitable chance–the first statute in Magna Charta–it is\nan everlasting Act of Parliament, my dear brother–all must die,” the\nagreement of his views with those of Burton, who had himself said\nof death, “’Tis an inevitable chance–the first statute in Magna\nCharta–an everlasting Act of Parliament–all must die,[2]” is even\ntextually exact.",
        "[Footnote 2: Ibid., p. 215.]",
        "In the next passage, however, the humourist gets the better of the\nplagiarist, and we are ready to forgive the theft for the happily\ncomic turn which he gives to it.",
        "Burton:",
        "  “Tully was much grieved for his daughter Tulliola’s death at first,\n  until such time that he had confirmed his mind by philosophical precepts;\n  then he began to triumph over fortune and grief, and for her\n  reception into heaven to be much more joyed than before he was\n  troubled for her loss.”",
        "Sterne:",
        "“When Tully was bereft of his daughter, at first he laid it to his\nheart, he listened to the voice of nature, and modulated his own unto\nit. O my Tullia! my daughter! my child!–Still, still, still–’twas O\nmy Tullia, my Tullia! Me thinks I see my Tullia, I hear my Tullia, I\ntalk with my Tullia. But as soon as he began to look into the stores\nof philosophy, and consider how many excellent things might be said\nupon the occasion, nobody on earth can conceive, says the great\norator, how happy, how joyful it made me.”",
        "“Kingdoms and provinces, cities and towns,” continues Burton, “have\ntheir periods, and are consumed.” “Kingdoms and provinces, and towns\nand cities,” exclaims Mr. Shandy, throwing the sentence, like\nthe “born orator” his son considered him, into the rhetorical\ninterrogative, “have they not their periods?” “Where,” he proceeds,\n\"is Troy, and Mycenae, and Thebes, and Delos, and Persepolis, and\nAgrigentum? What is become, brother Toby, of Nineveh and Babylon, of\nCyzicum and Mytilene? The fairest towns that ever the sun rose upon\"\n(and all, with the curious exception of Mytilene, enumerated by\nBurton) “are now no more.” And then the famous consolatory letter\nfrom Servius Sulpicius to Cicero on the death of Tullia is laid under\ncontribution–Burton’s rendering of the Latin being followed almost\nword for word. “Returning out of Asia,” declaims Mr. Shandy, “when I\nsailed from Aegina towards Megara” (when can this have been? thought\nmy Uncle Toby), “I began to view the country round about. Aegina\nwas behind me, Megara before,” &c., and so on, down to the final\nreflection of the philosopher, “Remember that thou art but a man;” at\nwhich point Sterne remarks coolly, “Now, my Uncle Toby knew not that\nthis last paragraph was an extract of Servius Sulpicius’s consolatory\nletter to Tully\"–the thing to be really known being that the\nparagraph was, in fact, Servius Sulpicius filtered through Burton.\nAgain, and still quoting from the Anatomy of Melancholy, Mr. Shandy\nremarks how “the Thracians wept when a child was born, and feasted and\nmade merry when a man went out of the world; and with reason.” He then\ngoes on to lay predatory hands on that fine, sad passage in Lucian,\nwhich Burton had quoted before him: “Is it not better not to hunger at\nall, than to eat? not to thirst, than to take physic to cure it?\"\n(why not “than to drink to satisfy thirst?” as Lucian wrote and Burton\ntranslated). “Is it not better to be freed from cares and agues, love\nand melancholy, and the other hot and cold fits of life, than, like a\ngalled traveller who comes weary to his inn, to be bound to begin his\njourney afresh?” Then, closing his Burton and opening his Bacon at the\nEssay on Death; he adds: “There is no terror, brother Toby, in its\n(Death’s) looks but what it borrows from groans and convulsions, and\"\n(here parody forces its way in) “the blowing of noses, and the wiping\naway of tears with the bottoms of curtains in a sick man’s bed-room;\"\nand with one more theft from Burton, after Seneca: “Consider, brother\nToby, when we are, death is not; and when death is, we are not,” this\nextraordinary cento of plagiarisms concludes.",
        "Not that this is Sterne’s only raid upon the quaint old writer of whom\nhe has here made such free use. Several other instances of word\nfor word appropriation might be quoted from this and the succeeding\nvolumes of Tristram Shandy. The apostrophe to “blessed health,\"\nin c. xxxiii. of vol. v. is taken direct from the Anatomy of\nMelancholy; so is the phrase, “He has a gourd for his head and a\npippin for his heart,” in c. ix.; so is the jest about Franciscus\nRibera’s computation of the amount of cubic space required by the\nsouls of the lost; so is Hilarion the hermit’s comparison of his body\nwith its unruly passions to a kicking ass. And there is a passage in\nthe Sentimental Journey, the “Fragment in the Abderitans,” which\nshows, Dr. Ferriar thinks–though it does not seem to me to show\nconclusively–that Sterne was unaware that what he was taking from\nBurton had been previously taken by Burton from Lucian.",
        "There is more excuse, in the opinion of the author of the\nIllustrations, for the literary thefts of the preacher than for\nthose of the novelist; since in sermons, Dr. Ferriar observes drily,\n\"the principal matter must consist of repetitions.”",
        "But it can hardly, I think, be admitted that the kind of “repetitions\"\nto which Sterne had recourse in the pulpit–or, at any rate,\nin compositions ostensibly prepared for the pulpit–are quite\njustifiable. Professor Jebb has pointed out, in a recent volume of\nthis series, that the description of the tortures of the Inquisition,\nwhich so deeply moved Corporal Trim in the famous Sermon on\nConscience, was really the work of Bentley; but Sterne has pilfered\nmore freely from a divine more famous as a preacher than the great\nscholar whose words he appropriated on that occasion. “Then shame and\ngrief go with her,” he exclaims in his singular sermon on “The Levite\nand his Concubine;” “and wherever she seeks a shelter may the hand of\nJustice shut the door against her!” an exclamation which is taken,\nas, no doubt, indeed, was the whole suggestion of the somewhat strange\nsubject, from the Contemplations of Bishop Hall. And so, again, we\nfind in Sterne’s sermon the following:",
        "  “Mercy well becomes the heart of all Thy creatures! but most of\n  Thy servant, a Levite, who offers up so many daily sacrifices to Thee\n  for the transgressions of Thy people. But to little purpose, he would\n  add, have I served at Thy altar, where my business was to sue for\n  mercy, had I not learned to practise it.”",
        "And in Hall’s Contemplations the following:",
        "  “Mercy becomes well the heart of any man, but most of a Levite.\n  He that had helped to offer so many sacrifices to God for the multitude\n  of every Israelite’s sins saw how proportionable it was that man\n  should not hold one sin unpardonable. He had served at the altar\n  to no purpose, if he (whose trade was to sue for mercy) had not at all\n  learned to practise it.”",
        "Sterne’s twelfth sermon, on the Forgiveness of Injuries, is merely\na diluted commentary on the conclusion of Hall’s “Contemplation of\nJoseph.” In the sixteenth sermon, the one on Shimei, we find:",
        "  “There is no small degree of malicious craft in fixing upon a season\n  to give a mark of enmity and ill will: a word, a look, which at\n  one time would make no impression, at another time wounds the\n  heart, and, like a shaft flying with the wind, pierces deep, which,\n  with its own natural force, would scarce have reached the object\n  aimed at.”",
        "This, it is evident, is but slightly altered, and by no means for the\nbetter, from the more terse and vigorous language of the Bishop:",
        "  “There is no small cruelty in the picking out of a time for mischief:\n  that word would scarce gall at one season which at another\n  killeth. The same shaft flying with the wind pierces deep, which\n  against it can hardly find strength to stick upright.”",
        "But enough of these pièces de conviction. Indictments for plagiarism\nare often too hastily laid; but there can be no doubt, I should\nimagine, in the mind of any reasonable being upon the evidence here\ncited, that the offence in this case is clearly proved. Nor, I\nthink, can there be much question as to its moral complexion. For the\npilferings from Bishop Hall, at any rate, no shadow of excuse can,\nso far as I can see, be alleged. Sterne could not possibly plead any\nbetter justification for borrowing Hall’s thoughts and phrases and\npassing them off upon his hearers or readers as original, than\nhe could plead for claiming the authorship of one of the Bishop’s\nbenevolent actions and representing himself to the world as the doer\nof the good deed. In the actual as in the hypothetical case there is\na dishonest appropriation by one man of the credit–in the former\ncase the intellectual, in the latter the moral credit–belonging to\nanother: the offence in the actual case being aggravated by the fact\nthat it involves a fraud upon the purchaser of the sermon, who pays\nmoney for what he may already have in his library. The plagiarisms\nfrom Burton stand upon a slightly different though not, I think, a\nmuch more defensible footing. For in this case it has been urged\nthat Sterne, being desirous of satirizing pedantry, was justified in\nresorting to the actually existent writings of an antique pedant of\nreal life; and that since Mr. Shandy could not be made to talk more\nlike himself than Burton talked like him, it was artistically\nlawful to put Burton’s exact words into Mr. Shandy’s mouth. It makes\na difference, it may be said, that Sterne is not here speaking in his\nown person, as he is in his Sermons, but in the person of one of his\ncharacters. This casuistry, however, does not seem to me to be sound.\nEven as regards the passages from ancient authors, which, while\nquoting them from Burton, he tacitly represents to his readers\nas taken from his own stores of knowledge, the excuse is hardly\nsufficient; while as regards the original reflections of the author of\nthe Anatomy of Melancholy it obviously fails to apply at all. And in\nany case there could be no necessity for the omission to acknowledge\nthe debt. Even admitting that no more characteristic reflections could\nhave been composed for Mr. Shandy than were actually to be found in\nBurton, art is not so exacting a mistress as to compel the artist\nto plagiarize against his will. A scrupulous writer, being also as\ningenious as Sterne, could have found some means of indicating the\nsource from which he was borrowing without destroying the dramatic\nillusion of the scene.",
        "But it seems clear enough that Sterne himself was troubled by no\nconscientious qualms on this subject. Perhaps the most extraordinary\ninstance of literary effrontery which was ever met with is the passage\nin vol. v.c. 1, which even that seasoned detective Dr. Ferriar is\nstartled into pronouncing “singular.” Burton had complained that\nwriters were like apothecaries, who “make new mixtures every day,” by\n\"pouring out of one vessel into another.” “We weave,” he said, “the\nsame web still, twist the same rope again and again.” And Sterne\nincolumi gravitate asks: “Shall we forever make new books as\napothecaries make new mixtures, by pouring only out of one vessel into\nanother? Are we forever to be twisting and untwisting the same rope,\nforever on the same track, forever at the same pace?” And this he\nwrites with the scissors actually opened in his hand for the almost\nbodily abstraction of the passage beginning, “Man, the most excellent\nand noble creature of the world!” Surely this denunciation of\nplagiarism by a plagiarist on the point of setting to work could only\nhave been written by a man who looked upon plagiarism as a good joke.",
        "Apart, however, from the moralities of the matter, it must in fairness\nbe admitted that in most cases Sterne is no servile copyist. He\nappropriates other men’s thoughts and phrases, and with them, of\ncourse, the credit for the wit, the truth, the vigour, or the learning\nwhich characterizes them; but he is seldom found, in Tristram\nShandy, at any rate, to have transferred them to his own pages out\nof a mere indolent inclination to save himself the trouble of\ncomposition. He takes them less as substitutes than as groundwork for\nhis own invention–as so much material for his own inventive powers\nto work upon; and those powers do generally work upon them with\nconspicuous skill of elaboration. The series of cuttings, for\ninstance, which he makes from Burton, on the occasion of Bobby\nShandy’s death, are woven into the main tissue of the dialogue with\nremarkable ingenuity and naturalness; and the bright strands of his\nown unborrowed humour fly flashing across the fabric at every transit\nof the shuttle. Or, to change the metaphor, we may say that in almost\nevery instance the jewels that so glitter in their stolen setting were\ncut and set by Sterne himself. Let us allow that the most expert of\nlapidaries is not justified in stealing his settings; but let us still\nnot forget that the jewels are his, or permit our disapproval of his\nlaxity of principle to make us unjust to his consummate skill.",
        "HUMOUR AND SENTIMENT.",
        "To talk of “the style” of Sterne is almost to play one of those tricks\nwith language of which he himself was so fond. For there is hardly any\ndefinition of the word which can make it possible to describe him as\nhaving any style at all. It is not only that he manifestly recognized\nno external canons whereto to conform the expression of his thoughts,\nbut he had, apparently, no inclination to invent and observe–except,\nindeed, in the most negative of senses–any style of his own. The\n\"style of Sterne,” in short, is as though one should say “the form\nof Proteus.” He was determined to be uniformly eccentric, regularly\nirregular, and that was all. His digressions, his asides, and his\nfooleries in general would, of course, have in any case necessitated\na certain general jerkiness of manner; but this need hardly have\nextended itself habitually to the structure of individual sentences,\nand as a matter of fact he can at times write, as he does for the most\npart in his Sermons, in a style which is not the less vigorous for\nbeing fairly correct. But as a rule his mode of expressing himself is\ndestitute of any pretensions to precision; and in many instances it\nis a perfect marvel of literary slipshod. Nor is there any ground for\nbelieving that the slovenliness was invariably intentional. Sterne’s\ntruly hideous French–French at which even Stratford-atte-Bowe would\nhave stood aghast–is in itself sufficient evidence of a natural\ninsensibility to grammatical accuracy. Here there can be no suspicion\nof designed defiance of rules; and more than one solecism of rather\na serious kind in his use of English words and phrases affords\nconfirmatory testimony to the same point. His punctuation is fearful\nand wonderful, even for an age in which the rationale of punctuation\nwas more imperfectly understood than it is at present; and this,\nthough an apparently slight matter, is not without value as an\nindication of ways of thought. But if we can hardly describe Sterne’s\nstyle as being in the literary sense a style at all, it has a very\ndistinct colloquial character of its own, and as such it is nearly\nas much deserving of praise as from the literary point of view it is\nopen to exception. Chaotic as it is in the syntactical sense, it is\na perfectly clear vehicle for the conveyance of thought: we are as\nrarely at a loss for the meaning of one of Sterne’s sentences as we\nare, for very different reasons, for the meaning of one of Macaulay’s.\nAnd his language is so full of life and colour, his tone so animated\nand vivacious, that we forget we are reading and not listening, and\nwe are as little disposed to be exacting in respect to form as though\nwe were listeners in actual fact. Sterne’s manner, in short, may\nbe that of a bad and careless writer, but it is the manner of a\nfirst-rate talker; and this, of course, enhances rather than detracts\nfrom the unwearying charm of his wit and humour.",
        "To attempt a precise and final distinction between these two\nlast-named qualities in Sterne or any one else would be no very\nhopeful task, perhaps; but those who have a keen perception of either\nfind no great difficulty in discriminating, as a matter of feeling,\nbetween the two. And what is true of the qualities themselves is\ntrue, mutatis mutandis, of the men by whom they have been most\nconspicuously displayed. Some wits have been humourists also; nearly\nall humourists have been also wits; yet the two fall, on the whole,\ninto tolerably well-marked classes, and the ordinary uncritical\njudgment would, probably, enable most men to state with sufficient\ncertainty the class to which each famous name in the world’s\nliterature belongs. Aristophanes, Shakspeare, Cervantes, Molière,\nSwift, Fielding, Lamb, Richter, Carlyle: widely as these writers\ndiffer from each other in style and genius, the least skilled reader\nwould hardly need to be told that the list which includes them all\nis a catalogue of humourists. And Cicero, Lucian, Pascal, Voltaire,\nCongreve, Pope, Sheridan, Courier, Sydney Smith–this, I suppose,\nwould be recognized at once as an enumeration of wits. Some of these\nhumourists, like Fielding, like Richter, like Carlyle, are always, or\nalmost always, humourists alone. Some of these wits, like Pascal,\nlike Pope, like Courier, are wits with no, or but slight, admixture\nof humour; and in the classification of these there is of course\nno difficulty at all. But even with the wits who very often give us\nhumour also, and with the humourists who as often delight us with\ntheir wit, we seldom find ourselves in any doubt as to the real and\nmore essential affinities of each. It is not by the wit which he has\ninfused into his talk, so much as by the humour with which he has\ndelineated the character, that Shakspeare has given his Falstaff an\nabiding place in our memories. It is not the repartees of Benedick and\nBeatrice, but the immortal fatuity of Dogberry, that the name of Much\nAdo About Nothing recalls. None of the verbal quips of Touchstone\ntickle us like his exquisite patronage of William and the fascination\nwhich he exercises over the melancholy Jaques. And it is the same\nthroughout all Shakspeare. It is of the humours of Bottom, and Launce,\nand Shallow, and Sly, and Aguecheek; it is of the laughter that treads\nupon the heels of horror and pity and awe, as we listen to the\nPorter in Macbeth, to the Grave-digger in Hamlet, to the Fool in\nLear–it is of these that we think when we think of Shakspeare in\nany other but his purely poetic mood. Whenever, that is to say, we\nthink of him as anything but a poet, we think of him, not as a wit,\nbut as a humourist. So, too, it is not the dagger-thrusts of the\nDrapier’s Letters, but the broad ridicule of the Voyage to Laputa,\nthe savage irony of the Voyage to the Houyhnhnms, that we associate\nwith the name of Swift. And, conversely, it is the cold, epigrammatic\nglitter of Congreve’s dialogue, the fizz and crackle of the fireworks\nwhich Sheridan serves out with undiscriminating hand to the most\ninsignificant of his characters–it is this which stamps the work of\nthese dramatists with characteristics far more marked than any which\nbelong to them in right of humorous portraiture of human foibles or\ningenious invention of comic incident.",
        "The place of Sterne is unmistakably among writers of the former class.\nIt is by his humour–his humour of character, his dramatic as distinct\nfrom his critical descriptive personal humour–though, of course,\nhe possesses this also, as all humourists must–that he lives and\nwill live. In Tristram Shandy, as in the Sermons, there is a\nsufficiency of wit, and considerably more than a sufficiency of\nhumorous reflection, innuendo, and persiflage; but it is the actors\nin his almost plotless drama who have established their creator in his\nniche in the Temple of Fame. We cannot, indeed, be sure that what has\ngiven him his hold upon posterity is what gave him his popularity with\nhis contemporaries. On the contrary, it is, perhaps, more probable\nthat he owed his first success with the public of his day to\nthose eccentricities which are for us a little too consciously\neccentric–those artifices which fail a little too conspicuously in\nthe ars celandi artem. But however these tricks may have pleased in\ndays when such tricks were new, they much more often weary than divert\nus now; and I suspect that many a man whose delight in the Corporal\nand his master, in Bridget and her mistress, is as fresh as ever,\ndeclines to accompany their creator in those perpetual digressions\ninto nonsense or semi-nonsense the fashion of which Sterne borrowed\nfrom Rabelais, without Rabelais’s excuse for adopting it. To us of\nthis day the real charm and distinction of the book is due to the\nmarvellous combination of vigour and subtlety in its portrayal of\ncharacter, and in the purity and delicacy of its humour. Those last\ntwo apparently paradoxical substantives are chosen advisedly, and\nemployed as the most convenient way of introducing that disagreeable\nquestion which no commentator on Sterne can possibly shirk, but which\nevery admirer of Sterne must approach with reluctance. There is, of\ncourse, a sense in which Sterne’s humour–if, indeed, we may bestow\nthat name on the form of jocularity to which I refer–is the very\nreverse of pure and delicate: a sense in which it is impure and\nindelicate in the highest degree. On this it is necessary, however\nbriefly, to touch; and to the weighty and many-counted indictment\nwhich may be framed against Sterne on this head there is, of course,\nbut one possible plea–the plea of guilty. Nay, the plea must go\nfurther than a mere admission of the offence; it must include an\nadmission of the worst motive, the worst spirit as animating the\noffender. It is not necessary to my purpose, nor doubtless congenial\nto the taste of the reader, that I should enter upon any critical\nanalysis of this quality in the author’s work, or compare him in this\nrespect with the two other great humourists who have been the\nworst offenders in the same way. In one of those highly interesting\ncriticisms of English literature which, even when they most\nconspicuously miss the mark, are so instructive to Englishmen, M.\nTaine has instituted an elaborate comparison–very much, I need hardly\nsay, to the advantage of the latter–between the indecency of Swift\nand that of Rabelais–that “good giant,” as his countryman calls him,\n\"who rolls himself joyously about on his dunghill, thinking no evil.\"\nAnd no doubt the world of literary moralists will always be divided\nupon the question–one mainly of national temperament–whether mere\nanimal spirits or serious satiric purpose is the best justification\nfor offences against cleanliness. It is, of course, only the former\ntheory, if either, which could possibly avail Sterne, and it would\nneed an unpleasantly minute analysis of this characteristic in his\nwritings to ascertain how far M. Taine’s eloquent defence of Rabelais\ncould be made applicable to his case. But the inquiry, one is glad\nto think, is as unnecessary as it would be disagreeable; for,\nunfortunately for Sterne, he must be condemned on a quantitativecomparison of indecency, whatever may be his fate when compared\nwith these other two great writers as regards the quality of their\nrespective transgressions. There can be no denying, I mean, that\nSterne is of all writers the most permeated and penetrated with\nimpurity of thought and suggestion; that in no other writer is its\nlatent presence more constantly felt, even if there be any in whom\nit is more often openly obtruded. The unclean spirit pursues him\neverywhere, disfiguring his scenes of humour, demoralizing his\npassages of serious reflection, debasing even his sentimental\ninterludes. His coarseness is very often as great a blot on his art as\non his morality–a thing which can very rarely be said of either Swift\nor Rabelais; and it is sometimes so distinctly fatal a blemish from\nthe purely literary point of view, that one is amazed at the critical\nfaculty which could have tolerated its presence.",
        "But when all this has been said of Sterne’s humour it still remains\ntrue that, in another sense of the words “purity” and “delicacy,\"\nhe possesses humour more pure and delicate than, perhaps, any other\nwriter in the world can show. For if that humour is the purest and\nmost delicate which is the freest from any admixture of farce,\nand produces its effects with the lightest touch, and the least\nobligations to ridiculous incident, or what may be called the\n\"physical grotesque,” in any shape–then one can point to passages\nfrom Sterne’s pen which, for fulfilment of these conditions, it would\nbe difficult to match elsewhere. Strange as it may seem to say this\nof the literary Gilray who drew the portrait of Dr. Slop, and of the\nliterary Grimaldi who tormented Phutatorius with the hot chestnut,\nit is nevertheless the fact that scene after scene may be cited from\nTristram Shandy, and those the most delightful in the book, which\nare not only free from even the momentary intrusion of either the\nclown or the caricaturist, but even from the presence of “comic\nproperties” (as actors would call them) of any kind: scenes of which\nthe external setting is of the simplest possible character, while the\nhumour is of that deepest and most penetrative kind which springs\nfrom the eternal incongruities of human nature, the ever-recurring\ncross-purposes of human lives.",
        "Carlyle classes Sterne with Cervantes among the great humourists of\nthe world; and from one, and that the most important, point of view\nthe praise is not extravagant. By no other writer besides Sterne,\nperhaps, since the days of the Spanish humourist, have the vast\nincongruities of human character been set forth with so masterly a\nhand. It is in virtue of the new insight which his humour opens to\nus of the immensity and variety of man’s life that Cervantes makes\nus feel that he is great: not delightful merely–not even eternally\ndelightful only, and secure of immortality through the perennial human\nneed of joy–but great, but immortal, in right of that which makes\nShakspeare and the Greek dramatists immortal, namely, the power, not\nalone over the pleasure-loving part of man’s nature, but over that\nequally universal but more enduring element in it, his emotions of\nwonder and of awe. It is to this greater power–this control over a\ngreater instinct than the human love of joy, that Cervantes owes his\ngreatness; and it will be found, though it may seem at first a hard\nsaying, that Sterne shares this power with Cervantes. To pass from\nQuixote and Sancho to Walter and Toby Shandy involves, of course, a\nstartling change of dramatic key–a notable lowering of dramatic\ntone. It is almost like passing from poetry to prose: it is certainly\npassing from the poetic in spirit and surroundings to the profoundly\nprosaic in fundamental conception and in every individual detail.\nBut those who do not allow accidental and external dissimilarities to\nobscure for them the inward and essential resemblances of things, must\noften, I think, have experienced from one of the Shandy dialogues the\nsame sort of impression that they derive from some of the most nobly\nhumorous colloquies between the knight and his squire, and must have\nbeen conscious through all outward differences of key and tone of a\ncommon element in each. It is, of course, a resemblance of relationsand not of personalities; for though there is something of the Knight\nof La Mancha in Mr. Shandy, there is nothing of Sancho about his\nbrother. But the serio-comic game of cross-purposes is the same\nbetween both couples; and what one may call the irony of human\nintercourse is equally profound, and pointed with equal subtlety,\nin each. In the Spanish romance, of course, it is not likely to be\nmissed. It is enough in itself that the deranged brain which takes\nwindmills for giants, and carriers for knights, and Rosinante for a\nBucephalus, has fixed upon Sancho Panza–the crowning proof of its\nmania–as the fitting squire of a knight-errant. To him–to this\ncompound of somnolence, shrewdness, and good nature–to this creature\nwith no more tincture of romantic idealism than a wine-skin, the\nknight addresses, without misgiving, his lofty dissertations on the\nglories and the duties of chivalry–the squire responding after\nhis fashion. And thus these two hold converse, contentedly\nincomprehensible to each other, and with no suspicion that they are as\nincapable of interchanging ideas as the inhabitants of two different\nplanets. With what heart-stirring mirth, and yet with what strangely\ndeeper feeling of the infinite variety of human nature, do we follow\ntheir converse throughout! Yet Quixote and Sancho are not more\nlife-like and human, nor nearer together at one point and farther\napart at another, than are Walter Shandy and his brother. The squat\nlittle Spanish peasant is not more gloriously incapable of following\nthe chivalric vagaries of his master than the simple soldier is of\ngrasping the philosophic crotchets of his brother. Both couples are\nin sympathetic contact absolute and complete at one point; at another\nthey are “poles asunder” both of them. And in both contrasts there\nis that sense of futility and failure, of alienation and\nmisunderstanding–that element of underlying pathos, in short, which\nso strangely gives its keenest salt to humour. In both alike there is\nthe same suggestion of the Infinite of disparity bounding the finite\nof resemblance–of the Incommensurable in man and nature, beside which\nall minor uniformities sink into insignificance.",
        "The pathetic element which underlies and deepens the humour is, of\ncourse, produced in the two cases in two exactly opposite ways. In\nboth cases it is a picture of human simplicity–of a noble and artless\nnature out of harmony with its surroundings–which moves us;\nbut whereas in the Spanish romance the simplicity is that of the\nincompris, in the English novel it is that of the man with whom\nthe incompris consorts. If there is pathos as well as humour, and\ndeepening the humour, in the figure of the distraught knight-errant\ntalking so hopelessly over the head of his attached squire’s morality,\nso too there is pathos, giving depth to the humour of the eccentric\nphilosopher, shooting so hopelessly wide of the intellectual\nappreciation of the most affectionate of brothers. One’s sympathy,\nperhaps, is even more strongly appealed to in the latter than in the\nformer case, because the effort of the good Captain to understand is\nfar greater than that of the Don to make himself understood, and the\nconcern of the former at his failure is proportionately more marked\nthan that of the latter at his. And the general rapport between\none of the two ill-assorted pairs is much closer than that of\nthe other. It is, indeed, the tantalizing approach to a mutual\nunderstanding which gives so much more subtle a zest to the humour\nof the relations between the two brothers Shandy than to that which\narises out of the relations between the philosopher and his wife.\nThe broad comedy of the dialogues between Mr. and Mrs. Shandy is\nirresistible in its way: but it is broad comedy. The philosopher\nknows that his wife does not comprehend him: she knows that she never\nwill; and neither of them much cares. The husband snubs her openly\nfor her mental defects, and she with perfect placidity accepts his\nrebukes. “Master,” as he once complains, “of one of the finest chains\nof reasoning in the world, he is unable for the soul of him to get a\nsingle link of it into the head of his wife;” but we never hear him\nlamenting in this serio-comic fashion over his brother’s inability to\nfollow his processes of reasoning. That is too serious a matter with\nboth of them; their mutual desire to share each other’s ideas and\ntastes is too strong; and each time that the philosopher shows his\nimpatience with the soldier’s fortification-hobby, or the soldier\nbreaks his honest shins over one of the philosopher’s crotchets, the\nregret and remorse on either side is equally acute and sincere. It\nmust be admitted, however, that Captain Shandy is the one who the more\nfrequently subjects himself to pangs of this sort, and who is the more\ninnocent sufferer of the two.",
        "From the broad and deep humour of this central conception of contrast\nflow as from a head-water innumerable rills of comedy through many and\nmany a page of dialogue; but not, of course, from this source alone.\nUncle Toby is ever delightful, even when his brother is not near him\nas his foil; the faithful Corporal brings out another side of his\ncharacter, upon which we linger with equal pleasure of contemplation;\nthe allurements of the Widow Wadman reveal him to us in yet\nanother–but always in a captivating aspect. There is, too, one need\nhardly say, an abundance of humour, of a high, though not the highest,\norder in the minor characters of the story–in Mrs. Shandy, in the\nfascinating widow, and even, under the coarse lines of the physical\ncaricature, in the keen little Catholic, Slop himself. But it is in\nToby Shandy alone that humour reaches that supreme level which it is\nonly capable of attaining when the collision of contrasted qualities\nin a human character produces a corresponding conflict of the emotions\nof mirth and tenderness in the minds of those who contemplate it.",
        "This, however, belongs more rightfully to the consideration of the\ncreative and dramatic element in Sterne’s genius; and an earlier place\nin the analysis is claimed by that power over the emotion of pity upon\nwhich Sterne, beyond question, prided himself more highly than upon\nany other of his gifts. He preferred, we can plainly see, to think of\nhimself, not as the great humourist, but as the great sentimentalist;\nand though the word “sentiment” had something even in his day of the\ndepreciatory meaning which distinguishes it nowadays from “pathos,\"\nthere can be little doubt that the thing appeared to Sterne to be, on\nthe whole, and both in life and literature, rather admirable than the\nreverse.",
        "What, then, were his notions of true “sentiment” in literature?\nWe have seen elsewhere that he repeats–it would appear\nunconsciously–and commends the canon which Horace propounds to the\ntragic poet in the words:",
        "  “Si vis me flere, dolendum\n  Primum ipsi tibi: tunc tua me infortunia laedent.”",
        "And that canon is sound enough, no doubt, in the sense in which it was\nmeant, and in its relation to the person to whom it was addressed. A\ntragic drama, peopled with heroes who set forth their woes in frigid\nand unimpassioned verse, will unquestionably leave its audience as\ncold as itself. Nor is this true of drama alone. All poetry, indeed,\nwhether dramatic or other, presupposes a sympathetic unity of emotion\nbetween the poet and those whom he addresses; and to this extent it\nis obviously true that he must feel before they can. Horace, who was\n(what every literary critic is not) a man of the world and an observer\nof human nature, did not, of course, mean that this capacity for\nfeeling was all, or even the chief part, of the poetic faculty. He\nmust have seen many an “intense” young Roman make that pathetic\nerror of the young in all countries and of all periods–the error of\nmistaking the capacity of emotion for the gift of expression. He did,\nhowever, undoubtedly mean that a poet’s power of affecting others\npresupposes passion in himself; and, as regards the poet, he was\nright. But his criticism takes no account whatever of one form of\nappeal to the emotions which has been brought by later art to a high\npitch of perfection, but with which the personal feeling of the artist\nhas not much more to do than the “passions” of an auctioneer’s clerk\nhave to do with the compilation of his inventory. A poet himself,\nHorace wrote for poets; to him the pathetic implied the ideal, the\nimaginative, the rhetorical; he lived before the age of Realism and\nthe Realists, and would scarcely have comprehended either the men or\nthe method if he could have come across them. Had he done so, however,\nhe would have been astonished to find his canon reversed, and to have\nperceived that the primary condition of the realist’s success, and\nthe distinctive note of those writers who have pressed genius into\nthe service of realism, is that they do not share–that they are\nunalterably and ostentatiously free from–the emotions to which\nthey appeal in their readers. A fortunate accident has enabled us to\ncompare the treatment which the world’s greatest tragic poet and its\ngreatest master of realistic tragedy have respectively applied to\nvirtually the same subject; and the two methods are never likely to\nbe again so impressively contrasted as in King Lear and Le Père\nGoriot. But, in truth, it must be impossible for any one who feels\nBalzac’s power not to feel also how it is heightened by Balzac’s\nabsolute calm–a calm entirely different from that stern composure\nwhich was merely a point of style and not an attitude of the heart\nwith the old Greek tragedians–a calm which, unlike theirs, insulates,\nso to speak, and is intended to insulate, the writer, to the end that\nhis individuality, of which only the electric current of sympathy ever\nmakes a reader conscious, may disappear, and the characters of the\ndrama stand forth the more life-like from the complete concealment of\nthe hand that moves them.",
        "Of this kind of art Horace, as has been said, knew nothing, and his\ncanon only applies to it by the rule of contraries. Undoubtedly, and\nin spite of the marvels which one great genius has wrought with it, it\nis a form lower than the poetic–essentially a prosaic, and in many\nor most hands an unimaginative, form of art; but for this very reason,\nthat it demands nothing of its average practitioner but a keen eye for\nfacts, great and small, and a knack of graphically recording them, it\nhas become a far more commonly and successfully cultivated form of\nart than any other. As to the question who are its practitioners, it\nwould, of course, be the merest dogmatism to commit one’s self to any\nattempt at rigid classification in such a matter. There are few if any\nwriters who can be described without qualification either as realists\nor as idealists. Nearly all of them, probably, are realists at one\nmoment and in one mood, and idealists at other moments and in other\nmoods. All that need be insisted on is that the methods of the two\nforms of art are essentially distinct, and that artistic failure must\nresult from any attempt to combine them; for, whereas the primary\ncondition of success in the one case is that the reader should feel\nthe sympathetic presence of the writer, the primary condition of\nsuccess in the other is that the writer should efface himself from the\nreader’s consciousness altogether. And it is, I think, the defiance of\nthese conditions which explains why so much of Sterne’s deliberately\npathetic writing is, from the artistic point of view, a failure. It is\nthis which makes one feel so much of it to be strained and unnatural,\nand which brings it to pass that some of his most ambitious efforts\nleave the reader indifferent, or even now and then contemptuous. In\nthose passages of pathos in which the effect is distinctly sought\nby realistic means Sterne is perpetually ignoring the “self-denying\nordinance” of his adopted method–perpetually obtruding his own\nindividuality, and begging us, as it were, to turn from the picture to\nthe artist, to cease gazing for a moment at his touching creation, and\nto admire the fine feeling, the exquisitely sympathetic nature of the\nman who created it. No doubt, as we must in fairness remember, it was\npart of his “humour\"–in Ancient Pistol’s sense of the word–to do\nthis; it is true, no doubt (and a truth which Sterne’s most famous\ncritic was too prone to ignore), that his sentiment is not always\nmeant for serious;[1] nay, the very word “sentimental” itself,\nthough in Sterne’s day, of course, it had acquired but a part of its\npresent disparaging significance, is a sufficient proof of that. But\nthere are, nevertheless, plenty of passages, both in Tristram Shandyand the Sentimental Journey, where the intention is wholly and\nunmixedly pathetic–where the smile is not for a moment meant to\ncompete with the tear–which are, nevertheless, it must be owned,\ncomplete failures, and failures traceable with much certainty, or so\nit seems to me, to the artistic error above-mentioned.",
        "[Footnote 1: Surely it was not so meant, for instance, in the passage\nabout the desobligeante, which had been “standing so many months\nunpitied in the corner of Monsieur Dessien’s coach-yard. Much, indeed,\nwas not to be said for it, but something might; and, when a few words\nwill rescue Misery out of her distress, I hate the man who can be\na churl of them.” “Does anybody,” asks Thackeray in a strangely\nmatter-of-fact fashion, “believe that this is a real sentiment? That\nthis luxury of generosity, this gallant rescue of Misery–out of an\nold cab–is genuine feeling?” Nobody, we should say. But, on the other\nhand, does anybody–or did anybody before Thackeray–suggest that it\nwas meant to pass for genuine feeling? Is it not an obvious piece of\nmock pathetic?]",
        "In one famous case, indeed, the failure can hardly be described as\nother than ludicrous. The figure of the distraught Maria of Moulines\nis tenderly drawn; the accessories of the picture–her goat, her dog,\nher pipe, her song to the Virgin–though a little theatrical, perhaps,\nare skilfully touched in; and so long as the Sentimental Traveller\nkeeps our attention fixed upon her and them the scene prospers well\nenough. But, after having bidden us duly note how “the tears trickled\ndown her cheeks,” the Traveller continues: “I sat down close by her,\nand Maria let me wipe them away as they fell with my handkerchief.\nI then steeped it in my own–and then in hers–and then in mine–and\nthen I wiped hers again; and as I did it I felt such undescribable\nemotions within me as, I am sure, could not be accounted for from any\ncombinations of matter and motion.” The reader of this may well ask\nhimself in wonderment whether he is really expected to make a third\nin the lachrymose group. We look at the passage again, and more\ncarefully, to see if, after all, we may not be intended to laugh, and\nnot to cry at it; but on finding, as clearly appears, that we actually\nare intended to cry at it the temptation to laugh becomes almost\nirresistible. We proceed, however, to the account of Maria’s\nwanderings to Rome and back, and we come to the pretty passage which\nfollows:",
        "  “How she had borne it, and how she had got supported, she could\n  not tell; but God tempers the wind, said Maria, to the shorn lamb.\n  Shorn indeed! and to the quick, said I; and wast thou in my own\n  land, where I have a cottage, I would take thee to it, and shelter thee;\n  thou shouldst eat of my own bread and drink of my own cup; I\n  would be kind to thy Sylvio; in all thy weaknesses and wanderings\n  I would seek after thee, and bring thee back. When the sun went\n  down I would say my prayers; and when I had done thou shouldst\n  play thy evening-song upon thy pipe; nor would the incense of my\n  sacrifice be worse accepted for entering heaven along with that of a\n  broken heart.”",
        "But then follows more whimpering:",
        "  “Nature melted within me [continues Sterne] as I said this; and\n  Maria observing, as I took out my handkerchief, that it was steeped\n  too much already to be of use, would needs go wash it in the stream.\n  And where will you dry it, Maria? said I. I’ll dry it in my bosom,\n  said she; ’twill do me good. And is your heart still so warm, Maria?\n  said I. I touched upon the string on which hung all her sorrows.\n  She looked with wistful disorder for some time in my face; and then,\n  without saying anything, took her pipe and played her service to the\n  Virgin.”",
        "Which are we meant to look at–the sorrows of Maria? or the\nsensibilities of the Sentimental Traveller? or the condition of the\npocket-handkerchief? I think it doubtful whether any writer of the\nfirst rank has ever perpetrated so disastrous a literary failure\nas this scene; but the main cause of that failure appears to me not\ndoubtful at all. The artist has no business within the frame of the\npicture, and his intrusion into it has spoilt it. The method adopted\nfrom the commencement is ostentatiously objective: we are taken\nstraight into Maria’s presence, and bidden to look at and to pity the\nunhappy maiden as described by the Traveller who met her. No attempt\nis made to place us at the outset in sympathy with him; he, until he\nthrusts himself before us, with his streaming eyes, and his drenched\npocket-handkerchief, is a mere reporter of the scene before him, and\nhe and his tears are as much out of place as if he were the compositor\nwho set up the type. It is not merely that we don’t want to know how\nthe scene affected him, and that we resent as an impertinence the\nelaborate account of his tender emotions; we don’t wish to be reminded\nof his presence at all. For, as we can know nothing (effectively)\nof Maria’s sorrows except as given in her appearance–the historical\nrecital of them and their cause being too curt and bald to be able to\nmove us–the best chance for moving our compassion for her is to\nmake the illusion of her presence as dramatically real as possible;\na chance which is, therefore, completely destroyed when the author of\nthe illusion insists on thrusting himself between ourselves and the\nscene.",
        "But, in truth, this whole episode of Maria of Moulines was, like more\nthan one of Sterne’s efforts after the pathetic, condemned to failure\nfrom the very conditions of its birth. These abortive efforts are\nno natural growth of his artistic genius; they proceed rather from\ncertain morbidly stimulated impulses of his moral nature which he\nforced his artistic genius to subserve. He had true pathetic power,\nsimple yet subtle, at his command; but it visited him unsought, and by\ninspiration from without. It came when he was in the dramatic and\nnot in the introspective mood; when he was thinking honestly of\nhis characters, and not of himself. But he was, unfortunately, too\nprone–and a long course of moral self-indulgence had confirmed him in\nit–to the habit of caressing his own sensibilities; and the result of\nthis was always to set him upon one of those attempts to be pathetic\nof malice prepense of which Maria of Moulines is one example, and\nthe too celebrated dead donkey of Nampont another. “It is agreeably\nand skilfully done, that dead jackass,” writes Thackeray; “like M. de\nSoubise’s cook on the campaign, Sterne dresses it, and serves it up\nquite tender, and with a very piquante sauce. But tears, and fine\nfeelings, and a white pocket-handkerchief, and a funeral sermon, and\nhorses and feathers, and a procession of mutes, and a hearse with\na dead donkey inside! Psha! Mountebank! I’ll not give thee one\npenny-piece for that trick, donkey and all.” That is vigorous\nridicule, and not wholly undeserved; but, on the other hand, not\nentirely deserved. There is less of artistic trick, it seems to me,\nand more of natural foible, about Sterne’s literary sentiment than\nThackeray was ever willing to believe; and I can find nothing worse,\nthough nothing better, in the dead ass of Nampont than in Maria of\nMoulines. I do not think there is any conscious simulation of\nfeeling in this Nampont scene; it is that the feeling itself is\noverstrained–that Sterne, hugging, as usual, his own sensibilities,\nmistook their value in expression for the purposes of art. The\nSentimental Traveller does not obtrude himself to the same extent as\nin the scene at Moulines; but a little consideration of the scene will\nshow how much Sterne relied on the mere presentment of the fact that\nhere was an unfortunate peasant who had lost his dumb companion, and\nhere a tender-hearted gentleman looking on and pitying him. As for\nany attempts to bring out, by objective dramatic touches, either the\ngrievousness of the bereavement or the grief of the mourner, such\nattempts as are made to do this are either commonplace or “one step\nin advance” of the sublime. Take this, for instance: “The mourner was\nsitting upon a stone bench at the door, with his ass’s pannel and its\nbridle on one side, which he took up from time to time, then laid them\ndown, looked at them, and shook his head. He then took the crust of\nbread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it; held it some time\nin his hand, then laid it upon the bit of his ass’s bridle–looked\nwistfully at the little arrangement he had made–and then gave a sigh.\nThe simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him,” &c. Simplicity,\nindeed, of a marvellous sort which could show itself by so\nextraordinary a piece of acting as this! Is there any critic who\ncandidly thinks it natural–I do not mean in the sense of mere\nevery-day probability, but of conformity to the laws of human\ncharacter? Is it true that in any country, among any people, however\nemotional, grief–real, unaffected, un-selfconscious grief–ever did\nor ever could display itself by such a trick as that of laying a piece\nof bread on the bit of a dead ass’s bridle? Do we not feel that if we\nhad been on the point of offering comfort or alms to the mourner, and\nsaw him go through this extraordinary piece of pantomime, we should\nhave buttoned up our hearts and pockets forthwith? Sentiment,\nagain, sails very near the wind of the ludicrous in the reply to the\nTraveller’s remark that the mourner had been a merciful master to the\ndead ass. “Alas!” the latter says, “I thought so when he was alive,\nbut now that he is dead I think otherwise. I fear the weight of\nmyself and my afflictions have been too much for him.” And the scene\nends flatly enough with the scrap of morality: “’Shame on the world!’\nsaid I to myself. ’Did we love each other as this poor soul loved his\nass, ’twould be something.’”",
        "The whole incident, in short, is one of those examples of the\ndeliberate-pathetic with which Sterne’s highly natural art had\nleast, and his highly artificial nature most, to do. He is never so\nunsuccessful as when, after formally announcing, as it were, that he\nmeans to be touching, he proceeds to select his subject, to marshal\nhis characters, to group his accessories, and with painful and\npainfully apparent elaboration to work up his scene to the weeping\npoint. There is no obviousness of suggestion, no spontaneity of\ntreatment about this “Dead Ass” episode; indeed, there is some reason\nto believe that it was one of those most hopeless of efforts–the\nattempt at the mechanical repetition of a former triumph. It is by no\nmeans improbable, at any rate, that the dead ass of Nampont owes its\npresence in the Sentimental Journey to the reception met with by the\nlive ass of Lyons in the seventh volume of Tristram Shandy. And yet\nwhat an astonishing difference between the two sketches!",
        "  “’Twas a poor ass, who had just turned in, with a couple of large\n  panniers upon his back, to collect eleemosynary turnip-tops and\n  cabbage-leaves, and stood dubious with his two fore-feet on the\n  inside of the threshold, and with his two hinder feet towards the\n  street, as not knowing very well whether he would go in or no.\n  Now, ’tis an animal (be in what hurry I may) I cannot bear to strike.\n  There is a patient endurance of sufferings wrote so unaffectedly in\n  his looks and carriage, which pleads so mightily for him that it\n  always disarms me, and to that degree that I do not like to speak\n  unkindly to him; on the contrary, meet him where I will, in town or\n  country, in cart or under panniers, whether in liberty or bondage,\n  I have ever something civil to say to him on my part; and, as one\n  word begets another (if he has as little to do as I), I generally\n  fall into conversation with him; and surely never is my imagination\n  so busy as in framing his responses from the etchings of his\n  countenance–and where those carry me not deep enough, in flying from\n  my own heart into his, and feeling what is natural for an ass to think,\n  as well as a man, upon the occasion.... Come, Honesty! said I, seeing\n  it was impracticable to pass betwixt him and the gate, art thou for\n  coming in or going out? The ass twisted his head round, to look up the\n  street. Well, replied I, we’ll wait a minute for thy driver. He turned\n  his head thoughtfully about, and looked wistfully the opposite way. I\n  understand thee perfectly, answered I: if thou takest a wrong step\n  in this affair he will cudgel thee to death. Well, a minute is but a\n  minute, and if it saves a fellow-creature a drubbing, it shall not be\n  set down as ill spent. He was eating the stem of an artichoke as\n  this discourse went on, and, in the little peevish contentions of nature\n  betwixt hunger and unsavouriness, had dropped it out of his\n  mouth half a dozen times, and picked it up again. God help thee,\n  Jack! said I, thou hast a bitter breakfast on’t, and many a bitter\n  blow, I fear, for its wages–’tis all, all bitterness to thee, whatever\n  life is to others. And now thy mouth, if one knew the truth of it, is\n  as bitter, I dare say, as soot (for he had cast aside the stem), and\n  thou hast not a friend, perhaps, in all this world that will give thee a\n  macaroon. In saying this I pulled out a paper of ’em, which I had\n  just purchased, and gave him one; and, at this moment that I am\n  telling it, my heart smites me that there was more of pleasantry in\n  the conceit of seeing how an ass would eat a macaroon, than of\n  benevolence in giving him one, which presided in the act. When the\n  ass had eaten his macaroon I pressed him to come in. The poor\n  beast was heavy loaded, his legs seemed to tremble under him, he\n  hung rather backwards, and as I pulled at his halter it broke short\n  in my hand. He looked up pensive in my face. ’Don’t thrash me\n  with it; but if you will, you may.’ ’If I do,’ said I, ’I’ll be d––d.’”",
        "Well might Thackeray say of this passage that, “the critic who refuses\nto see in it wit, humour, pathos, a kind nature speaking, and a real\nsentiment, must be hard indeed to move and to please.” It is, in\ntruth, excellent; and its excellence is due to its possessing nearly\nevery one of those qualities, positive and negative, which the two\nother scenes above quoted are without. The author does not here\nobtrude himself, does not importune us to admire his exquisitely\ncompassionate nature; on the contrary, he at once amuses us and\nenlists our sympathies by that subtly humorous piece of self-analysis,\nin which he shows how large an admixture of curiosity was contained\nin his benevolence. The incident, too, is well chosen. No forced\nconcurrence of circumstances brings it about: it is such as any man\nmight have met with anywhere in his travels, and it is handled in a\nsimple and manly fashion. The reader is with the writer throughout;\nand their common mood of half-humorous pity is sustained, unforced,\nbut unbroken, from first to last.",
        "One can hardly say as much for another of the much-quoted pieces from\nthe Sentimental Journey–the description of the caged starling.\nThe passage is ingeniously worked into its context; and if we were\nto consider it as only intended to serve the purpose of a sudden\nand dramatic discomfiture of the Traveller’s somewhat inconsiderate\nmoralizings on captivity, it would be well enough. But, regarded as\na substantive appeal to one’s emotions, it is open to the criticisms\nwhich apply to most other of Sterne’s too deliberate attempts at the\npathetic. The details of the picture are too much insisted on, and\nthere is too much of self-consciousness in the artist. Even at the\nvery close of the story of Le Fevre’s death–finely told though, as\na whole, it is–there is a jarring note. Even while the dying man is\nbreathing his last our sleeve is twitched as we stand at his bedside,\nand our attention forcibly diverted from the departing soldier to the\nliterary ingenuities of the man who is describing his end:",
        "  “There was a frankness in my Uncle Toby, not the effect of familiarity,\n  but the cause of it, which let you at once into his soul, and\n  showed you the goodness of his nature. To this there was something\n  in his looks, and voice, and manner, superadded, which eternally beckoned\n  to the unfortunate to come and take shelter under him; so that\n  before my Uncle Toby had half finished the kind offers he was making\n  to the father had the son insensibly pressed up close to his knees,\n  and had taken hold of the breast of his coat, and was pulling it towards\n  him. The blood and spirits of Le Fevre, which were waxing\n  cold and slow within him, and were retreating to their last citadel,\n  the heart, rallied back; the film forsook his eyes for a moment; he\n  looked up wishfully in my Uncle Toby’s face, then cast a look upon\n  his boy–and that ligament, fine as it was, was never broken.”",
        "How excellent all that is! and how perfectly would the scene have\nended had it closed with the tender and poetic image which thus\ndescribes the dying soldier’s commendation of his orphan boy to the\ncare of his brother-in-arms! But what of this, which closes the scene,\nin fact?",
        "  “Nature instantly ebbed again; the film returned to its place; the\n  pulse fluttered–stopped–went on–throbbed–stopped again–moved,\n  stopped. Shall I go on? No.”",
        "Let those admire this who can. To me I confess it seems to spoil a\ntouching and simple death-bed scene by a piece of theatrical trickery.",
        "The sum, in fact, of the whole matter appears to be, that the\nsentiment on which Sterne so prided himself–the acute sensibilities\nwhich he regarded with such extraordinary complacency, were, as has\nbeen before observed, the weakness, and not the strength, of his\npathetic style. When Sterne the artist is uppermost, when he is\nsurveying his characters with that penetrating eye of his, and above\nall when he is allowing his subtle and tender humour to play upon them\nunrestrained, he can touch the springs of compassionate emotion in\nus with a potent and unerring hand. But when Sterne the man is\nuppermost–when he is looking inward and not outward, contemplating\nhis own feelings instead of those of his personages, his cunning\nfails him altogether. He is at his best in pathos when he is most\nthe humourist; or rather, we may almost say, his pathos is never good\nunless when it is closely interwoven with his humour. In this, of\ncourse, there is nothing at all surprising. The only marvel is, that a\nman who was such a master of the humorous, in its highest and deepest\nsense, should seem to have so little understood how near together\nlie the sources of tears and laughter on the very way-side of man’s\nmysterious life.",
        "PLACE IN ENGLISH LITERATURE.",
        "Subtle as is Sterne’s humour, and true as, in its proper moods, is\nhis pathos, it is not to these but to the parent gift from which they\nsprang, and perhaps to only one special display of that gift, that he\nowes his immortality. We are accustomed to bestow so lightly this last\nhyperbolic honour–hyperbolic always, even when we are speaking of\na Homer or a Shakspeare, if only we project the vision far enough\nforward through time–that the comparative ease with which it is to be\nearned has itself come to be exaggerated. There are so many “deathless\nones” about–if I may put the matter familiarly–in conversation and\nin literature, that we get into the way of thinking that they are\nreally a considerable body in actual fact, and that the works which\nhave triumphed over death are far more numerous still. The real truth,\nhowever, is, that not only are “those who reach posterity a very\nselect company indeed,” but most of them have come much nearer missing\ntheir destiny than is popularly supposed. Of the dozen or score of\nwriters in one century whom their own contemporaries fondly decree\nimmortal, one-half, perhaps, may be remembered in the next; while of\nthe creations which were honoured with the diploma of immortality a\nvery much smaller proportion as a rule survive. Only some fifty per\ncent, of the prematurely laurel-crowned reach the goal; and often even\nupon their brows there flutter but a few stray leaves of the bay.\nA single poem, a solitary drama–nay, perhaps one isolated figure,\npoetic or dramatic–avails, and but barely avails, to keep the\nimmortal from putting on mortality. Hence we need think it no\ndisparagement to Sterne to say that he lives not so much in virtue\nof his creative power as of one great individual creation. His\nimaginative insight into character in general was, no doubt,\nconsiderable; his draughtsmanship, whether as exhibited in the rough\nsketch or in the finished portrait, is unquestionably most vigorous;\nbut an artist may put a hundred striking figures upon his canvas for\none that will linger in the memory of those who have gazed upon it;\nand it is, after all, I think, the one figure of Captain Tobias Shandy\nwhich has graven itself indelibly on the memory of mankind. To have\nmade this single addition to the imperishable types of human character\nembodied in the world’s literature may seem, as has been said, but\na light matter to those who talk with light exaggeration of the\nachievements of the literary artist; but if we exclude that one\ncreative prodigy among men, who has peopled a whole gallery with\nimaginary beings more real than those of flesh and blood, we shall\nfind that very few archetypal creations have sprung from any single\nhand. Now, My Uncle Toby is as much the archetype of guileless good\nnature, of affectionate simplicity, as Hamlet is of irresolution,\nor Iago of cunning, or Shylock of race-hatred; and he contrives to\npreserve all the characteristics of an ideal type amid surroundings of\nintensely prosaic realism, with which he himself, moreover, considered\nas an individual character in a specific story, is in complete,\naccord. If any one be disposed to underrate the creative and dramatic\npower to which this testifies, let him consider how it has commonly\nfared with those writers of prose fiction who have attempted to\npersonify a virtue in a man. Take the work of another famous English\nhumourist and sentimentalist, and compare Uncle Toby’s manly and\ndignified gentleness of heart with the unreal “gush” of the Brothers\nCheeryble, or the fatuous benevolence of Mr. Pickwick. We do not\nbelieve in the former, and we cannot but despise the latter. But\nCaptain Shandy is reality itself, within and without; and though\nwe smile at his naïveté, and may even laugh outright at his boyish\nenthusiasm for his military hobby, we never cease to respect him for a\nmoment. There is no shirking or softening of the comic aspects of his\ncharacter; there could not be, of course, for Sterne needed him\nmore, and used him more, for his purposes as a humourist than for his\npurposes as a sentimentalist. Nay, it is on the rare occasions when he\ndeliberately sentimentalizes with Captain Shandy that the Captain is\nthe least delightful; it is then that the hand loses its cunning, and\nthe stroke strays; it is then, and only then, that the benevolence\nof the good soldier seems to verge, though ever so little, upon\naffectation. It is a pity, for instance, that Sterne should, in\nillustration of Captain Shandy’s kindness of heart, have plagiarized\n(as he is said to have done) the incident of the tormenting fly,\ncaught and put out of the window with the words “Get thee gone, poor\ndevil! Why should I harm thee? The world is surely large enough for\nthee and me.” There is something too much of self-conscious virtue in\nthe apostrophe. This, we feel, is not the real Uncle Toby of\nSterne’s objective mood; it is the Uncle Toby of the subjectifying\nsentimentalist, surveying his character through the false medium\nof his own hypertrophied sensibilities. These lapses, however, are,\nfortunately, rare. As a rule we see the worthy Captain only as he\nappeared to his creator’s keen dramatic eye, and as he is set before\nus in a thousand exquisite touches of dialogue–the man of simple mind\nand soul, profoundly unimaginative and unphilosophical, but lacking\nnot in a certain shrewd common-sense; exquisitely naïf, and\ndelightfully mal-à-propos in his observations, but always\npardonably, never foolishly, so; inexhaustibly amiable, but with no\nweak amiability; homely in his ways, but a perfect gentleman withal;\nin a word, the most winning and lovable personality that is to be met\nwith, surely, in the whole range of fiction.",
        "It is, in fact, with Sterne’s general delineations of character as\nit is, I have attempted to show, with his particular passages of\nsentiment. He is never at his best and truest–as, indeed, no writer\nof fiction ever is or can be–save when he is allowing his dramatic\nimagination to play the most freely upon his characters, and thinking\nleast about himself. This is curiously illustrated in his handling\nof what is, perhaps, the next most successful of the uncaricatured\nportraits in the Shandy gallery–the presentment of the Rev. Mr.\nYorick. Nothing can be more perfect in its way than the picture of the\n\"lively, witty, sensitive, and heedless parson,” in chapter x. of the\nfirst volume of Tristram Shandy. We seem to see the thin, melancholy\nfigure on the rawboned horse–the apparition which could “never\npresent itself in the village but it caught the attention of old and\nyoung,” so that “labour stood still as he passed, the bucket hung\nsuspended in the middle of the well, the spinning-wheel forgot its\nround; even chuck-farthing and shuffle-cap themselves stood gaping\ntill he was out of sight.” Throughout this chapter Sterne, though\ndescribing himself, is projecting his personality to a distance, as it\nwere, and contemplating it dramatically; and the result is excellent.\nWhen in the next chapter he becomes “lyrical,” so to speak; when the\nreflection upon his (largely imaginary) wrongs impels him to look\ninward, the invariable consequence follows; and though Yorick’s much\nbepraised death-scene, with Eugenius at his bed-side, is redeemed\nfrom entire failure by an admixture of the humorous with its attempted\npathos, we ask ourselves with some wonder what the unhappiness–or the\ndeath itself, for that matter–is “all about.” The wrongs which were\nsupposed to have broken Yorick’s heart are most imperfectly specified\n(a comic proof, by the way, of Sterne’s entire absorption in himself,\nto the confusion of his own personal knowledge with that of the\nreader), and the first conditions of enlisting the reader’s sympathies\nare left unfulfilled.",
        "But it is comparatively seldom that this foible of Sterne obtrudes\nitself upon the strictly narrative and dramatic parts of his work;\nand, next to the abiding charm and interest of his principal figure,\nit is by the admirable life and colour of his scenes that he exercises\nhis strongest powers of fascination over a reader. Perpetual as\nare Sterne’s affectations, and tiresome as is his eternal\nself-consciousness when he is speaking in his own person, yet when\nonce the dramatic instinct fairly lays hold of him there is no writer\nwho ever makes us more completely forget him in the presence of his\ncharacters–none who can bring them and their surroundings, their\nlooks and words, before us with such convincing force of reality.\nOne wonders sometimes whether Sterne himself was aware of the high\ndramatic excellence of many of what actors would call his “carpenter’s\nscenes\"–the mere interludes introduced to amuse us while the stage is\nbeing prepared for one of those more elaborate and deliberate displays\nof pathos or humour, which do not always turn out to be unmixed\nsuccesses when they come. Sterne prided himself vastly upon the\nincident of Le Fevre’s death; but I dare say that there is many a\nmodern reader who would rather have lost this highly-wrought piece of\ndomestic drama, than that other exquisite little scene in the kitchen\nof the inn, when Corporal Trim toasts the bread which the sick\nlieutenant’s son is preparing for his father’s posset, while “Mr.\nYorick’s curate was smoking a pipe by the fire, but said not a word,\ngood or bad, to comfort the youth.” The whole scene is absolute life;\nand the dialogue between the Corporal and the parson, as related by\nthe former to his master, with Captain Shandy’s comments thereon, is\nalmost Shakspearian in its excellence. Says the Corporal:",
        "  “When the lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast he\n  felt himself a little revived, and sent down into the kitchen to let me\n  know that in about ten minutes he should be glad if I would step\n  upstairs, I believe, said the landlord, he is going to say his prayers,\n  for there was a book laid on the chair by the bed-side, and as I\n  shut the door I saw him take up a cushion. I thought, said the curate,\n  that you gentlemen of the army, Mr. Trim, never said your prayers\n  at all. I heard the poor gentleman say his prayers last night,\n  said the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could\n  not have believed it. Are you sure of it? replied the curate. A\n  soldier, an’ please your reverence, said I, prays as often (of his own\n  accord) as a parson; and when he is fighting for his king, and for\n  his own life, and for his honour too, he has the most reason to pray\n  to God of any one in the whole world. ’Twas well said of thee, Trim,\n  said my Uncle Toby. But when a soldier, said I, an’ please your\n  reverence, has been standing for twelve hours together in the trenches,\n  up to his knees in cold water–or engaged, said I, for months together\n  in long and dangerous marches; harassed, perhaps, in his rear today;\n  harassing others to-morrow; detached here; countermanded\n  there; resting this night out upon his arms; beat up in his shirt the\n  next; benumbed in his joints; perhaps without straw in his tent to\n  kneel on, [he] must say his prayers how and when he can. I believe,\n  said I–for I was piqued, quoth the Corporal, for the reputation\n  of the army–I believe, an’t please your reverence, said I, that when\n  a soldier gets time to pray, he prays as heartily as a parson–though\n  not with all his fuss and hypocrisy. Thou shouldst not have said\n  that, Trim, said my Uncle Toby; for God only knows who is a hypocrite\n  and who is not. At the great and general review of us all,\n  corporal, at the day of judgment (and not till then) it will be seen\n  who have done their duties in this world and who have not, and we\n  shall be advanced, Trim, accordingly. I hope we shall, said Trim.\n  It is in the Scripture, said my Uncle Toby, and I will show it thee in\n  the morning. In the meantime, we may depend upon it, Trim, for our\n  comfort, said my Uncle Toby, that God Almighty is so good and just\n  a governor of the world, that if we have but done our duties in it, it\n  will never be inquired into whether we have done them in a red coat\n  or a black one. I hope not, said the Corporal. But go on, said my\n  Uncle Toby, with thy story.”",
        "We might almost fancy ourselves listening to that noble prose colloquy\nbetween the disguised king and his soldiers on the night before\nAgincourt, in Henry V. And though Sterne does not, of course, often\nreach this level of dramatic dignity, there are passages in abundance\nin which his dialogue assumes, through sheer force of individualized\ncharacter, if not all the dignity, at any rate all the impressive\nforce and simplicity, of the “grand style.”",
        "Taken altogether, however, his place in English letters is hard to\nfix, and his tenure in human memory hard to determine. Hitherto he has\nheld his own, with the great writers of his era, but it has been in\nvirtue, as I have attempted to show, of a contribution to the literary\npossessions of mankind which is as uniquely limited in amount as it is\nexceptionally perfect in quality. One cannot but feel that, as regards\nthe sum of his titles to recollection, his name stands far below\neither of those other two which in the course of the last century\nadded themselves to the highest rank among the classics of English\nhumour. Sterne has not the abounding life and the varied human\ninterest of Fielding; and, to say nothing of his vast intellectual\ninferiority to Swift, he never so much as approaches those problems of\neverlasting concernment to man which Swift handles with so terrible\na fascination. Certainly no enthusiastic Gibbon of the future is ever\nlikely to say of Sterne’s “pictures of human manners” that they will\noutlive the palace of the Escurial and the Imperial Eagle of the\nHouse of Austria. Assuredly no one will ever find in this so-called\nEnglish antitype of the Curé of Meudon any of the deeper qualities of\nthat gloomy and commanding spirit which has been finely compared to\nthe “soul of Rabelais habitans in sicco.” Nay, to descend even to\nminor aptitudes, Sterne cannot tell a story as Swift and Fielding\ncan tell one; and his work is not assured of life as Tom Jones and\nGulliver’s Travels, considered as stories alone, would be assured\nof it, even if the one were stripped of its cheerful humour, and the\nother disarmed of its savage allegory. And hence it might be rash to\npredict that Sterne’s days will be as long in the land of literary\nmemory as the two great writers aforesaid. Banked, as he still is,\namong “English classics,” he undergoes, I suspect, even more than an\nEnglish classic’s ordinary share of reverential neglect. Among those\nwho talk about him he has, I should imagine, fewer readers than\nFielding, and very much fewer than Swift. Nor is he likely to increase\ntheir number as time goes on, but rather, perhaps, the contrary.\nIndeed, the only question is whether with the lapse of years he will\nnot, like other writers as famous in their day, become yet more of a\nmere name. For there is still, of course, a further stage to which he\nmay decline. That object of so much empty mouth-honour, the English\nclassic of the last and earlier centuries, presents himself for\nclassification under three distinct categories. There is the class who\nare still read in a certain measure, though in a much smaller measure\nthan is pretended, by the great body of ordinarily well-educated men.\nOf this class, the two authors whose names I have already cited, Swift\nand Fielding, are typical examples; and it may be taken to include\nGoldsmith also. Then comes the class of those whom the ordinarily\nwell-educated public, whatever they may pretend, read really very\nlittle or not at all; and in this class we may couple Sterne with\nAddison, with Smollett, and, except, of course, as to Robinson\nCrusoe–unless, indeed, our blasé boys have outgrown him among\nother pleasures of boyhood–with Defoe. But below this there is yet a\nthird class of writers, who are not only read by none but the critic,\nthe connoisseur, or the historian of literature, but are scarcely read\neven by them, except from curiosity, or “in the way of business.” The\ntype of this class is Richardson; and one cannot, I say, help asking\nwhether he will hereafter have Sterne as a companion of his dusty\nsolitude. Are Tristram Shandy and the Sentimental Journey destined\nto descend from the second class into the third–from the region of\npartial into that of total neglect, and to have their portion with\nClarissa Harlowe and Sir Charles Grandison? The unbounded vogue\nwhich they enjoyed in their time will not save them; for sane and\nsober critics compared Richardson in his day to Shakspeare, and\nDiderot broke forth into prophetic rhapsodies upon the immortality of\nhis works which to us in these days have become absolutely pathetic\nin their felicity of falsified prediction. Seeing, too, that a good\nthree-fourths of the attractions which won Sterne his contemporary\npopularity are now so much dead weight of dead matter, and that the\nvital residuum is in amount so small, the fate of Richardson might\nseem to be but too close behind him. Yet it is difficult to believe\nthat this fate will ever quite overtake him. His sentiment may have\nmostly ceased–it probably has ceased–to stir any emotion at all in\nthese days; but there is an imperishable element in his humour. And\nthough the circle of his readers may have no tendency to increase, one\ncan hardly suppose that a charm, which those who still feel it feel so\nkeenly, will ever entirely cease to captivate; or that time can have\nany power over a perfume which so wonderfully retains the pungent\nfreshness of its fragrance after the lapse of a hundred years.",
