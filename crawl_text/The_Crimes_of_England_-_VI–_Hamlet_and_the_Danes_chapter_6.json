        "In the one classic and perfect literary product that ever came out of\nGermany–I do not mean “Faust,” but Grimm’s Fairy Tales–there is a\ngorgeous story about a boy who went through a number of experiences\nwithout learning how to shudder. In one of them, I remember, he was\nsitting by the fireside and a pair of live legs fell down the chimney\nand walked about the room by themselves. Afterwards the rest fell down\nand joined up; but this was almost an anti-climax. Now that is very\ncharming, and full of the best German domesticity. It suggests truly\nwhat wild adventures the traveller can find by stopping at home. But it\nalso illustrates in various ways how that great German influence on\nEngland, which is the matter of these essays, began in good things and\ngradually turned to bad. It began as a literary influence, in the lurid\ntales of Hoffmann, the tale of “Sintram,” and so on; the revisualising\nof the dark background of forest behind our European cities. That old\nGerman darkness was immeasurably livelier than the new German light. The\ndevils of Germany were much better than the angels. Look at the Teutonic\npictures of “The Three Huntsmen” and observe that while the wicked\nhuntsman is effective in his own way, the good huntsman is weak in every\nway, a sort of sexless woman with a face like a teaspoon. But there is\nmore in these first forest tales, these homely horrors. In the earlier\nstages they have exactly this salt of salvation, that the boy does notshudder. They are made fearful that he may be fearless, not that he may\nfear. As long as that limit is kept, the barbaric dreamland is decent;\nand though individuals like Coleridge and De Quincey mixed it with worse\nthings (such as opium), they kept that romantic rudiment upon the whole.\nBut the one disadvantage of a forest is that one may lose one’s way in\nit. And the one danger is not that we may meet devils, but that we may\nworship them. In other words, the danger is one always associated, by\nthe instinct of folk-lore, with forests; it is enchantment, or the\nfixed loss of oneself in some unnatural captivity or spiritual\nservitude. And in the evolution of Germanism, from Hoffmann to\nHauptmann, we do see this growing tendency to take horror seriously,\nwhich is diabolism. The German begins to have an eerie abstract sympathy\nwith the force and fear he describes, as distinct from their objective.\nThe German is no longer sympathising with the boy against the goblin,\nbut rather with the goblin against the boy. There goes with it, as\nalways goes with idolatry, a dehumanised seriousness; the men of the\nforest are already building upon a mountain the empty throne of the\nSuperman. Now it is just at this point that I for one, and most men who\nlove truth as well as tales, begin to lose interest. I am all for “going\nout into the world to seek my fortune,” but I do not want to find\nit–and find it is only being chained for ever among the frozen figures\nof the Sieges Allees. I do not want to be an idolator, still less an\nidol. I am all for going to fairyland, but I am also all for coming\nback. That is, I will admire, but I will not be magnetised, either by\nmysticism or militarism. I am all for German fantasy, but I will resist\nGerman earnestness till I die. I am all for Grimm’s Fairy Tales; but if\nthere is such a thing as Grimm’s Law, I would break it, if I knew what\nit was. I like the Prussian’s legs (in their beautiful boots) to fall\ndown the chimney and walk about my room. But when he procures a head and\nbegins to talk, I feel a little bored. The Germans cannot really be deep\nbecause they will not consent to be superficial. They are bewitched by\nart, and stare at it, and cannot see round it. They will not believe\nthat art is a light and slight thing–a feather, even if it be from an\nangelic wing. Only the slime is at the bottom of a pool; the sky is on\nthe surface. We see this in that very typical process, the Germanising\nof Shakespeare. I do not complain of the Germans forgetting that\nShakespeare was an Englishman. I complain of their forgetting that\nShakespeare was a man; that he had moods, that he made mistakes, and,\nabove all, that he knew his art was an art and not an attribute of\ndeity. That is what is the matter with the Germans; they cannot “ring\nfancy’s knell\"; their knells have no gaiety. The phrase of Hamlet about\n“holding the mirror up to nature” is always quoted by such earnest\ncritics as meaning that art is nothing if not realistic. But it really\nmeans (or at least its author really thought) that art is nothing if not\nartificial. Realists, like other barbarians, really believe the\nmirror; and therefore break the mirror. Also they leave out the phrase\n“as ’twere,” which must be read into every remark of Shakespeare, and\nespecially every remark of Hamlet. What I mean by believing the mirror,\nand breaking it, can be recorded in one case I remember; in which a\nrealistic critic quoted German authorities to prove that Hamlet had a\nparticular psycho-pathological abnormality, which is admittedly nowhere\nmentioned in the play. The critic was bewitched; he was thinking of\nHamlet as a real man, with a background behind him three dimensions\ndeep–which does not exist in a looking-glass. “The best in this kind\nare but shadows.” No German commentator has ever made an adequate note\non that. Nevertheless, Shakespeare was an Englishman; he was nowhere\nmore English than in his blunders; but he was nowhere more successful\nthan in the description of very English types of character. And if\nanything is to be said about Hamlet, beyond what Shakespeare has said\nabout him, I should say that Hamlet was an Englishman too. He was as\nmuch an Englishman as he was a gentleman, and he had the very grave\nweaknesses of both characters. The chief English fault, especially in\nthe nineteenth century, has been lack of decision, not only lack of\ndecision in action, but lack of the equally essential decision in\nthought–which some call dogma. And in the politics of the last century,\nthis English Hamlet, as we shall see, played a great part, or rather\nrefused to play it.",
        "There were, then, two elements in the German influence; a sort of pretty\nplaying with terror and a solemn recognition of terrorism. The first\npointed to elfland, and the second to–shall we say, Prussia. And by\nthat unconscious symbolism with which all this story develops, it was\nsoon to be dramatically tested, by a definite political query, whether\nwhat we really respected was the Teutonic fantasy or the Teutonic fear.",
        "The Germanisation of England, its transition and turning-point, was well\ntypified by the genius of Carlyle. The original charm of Germany had\nbeen the charm of the child. The Teutons were never so great as when\nthey were childish; in their religious art and popular imagery the\nChrist-Child is really a child, though the Christ is hardly a man. The\nself-conscious fuss of their pedagogy is half-redeemed by the\nunconscious grace which called a school not a seed-plot of citizens, but\nmerely a garden of children. All the first and best forest-spirit is\ninfancy, its wonder, its wilfulness, even its still innocent fear.\nCarlyle marks exactly the moment when the German child becomes the\nspoilt child. The wonder turns to mere mysticism; and mere mysticism\nalways turns to mere immoralism. The wilfulness is no longer liked, but\nis actually obeyed. The fear becomes a philosophy. Panic hardens into\npessimism; or else, what is often equally depressing, optimism.",
        "Carlyle, the most influential English writer of that time, marks all\nthis by the mental interval between his “French Revolution” and his\n“Frederick the Great.” In both he was Germanic. Carlyle was really as\nsentimental as Goethe; and Goethe was really as sentimental as Werther.\nCarlyle understood everything about the French Revolution, except that\nit was a French revolution. He could not conceive that cold anger that\ncomes from a love of insulted truth. It seemed to him absurd that a man\nshould die, or do murder, for the First Proposition of Euclid; should\nrelish an egalitarian state like an equilateral triangle; or should\ndefend the Pons Asinorum as Codes defended the Tiber bridge. But anyone\nwho does not understand that does not understand the French\nRevolution–nor, for that matter, the American Revolution. “We hold\nthese truths to be self-evident”: it was the fanaticism of truism. But\nthough Carlyle had no real respect for liberty, he had a real reverence\nfor anarchy. He admired elemental energy. The violence which repelled\nmost men from the Revolution was the one thing that attracted him to it.\nWhile a Whig like Macaulay respected the Girondists but deplored the\nMountain, a Tory like Carlyle rather liked the Mountain and quite unduly\ndespised the Girondists. This appetite for formless force belongs, of\ncourse, to the forests, to Germany. But when Carlyle got there, there\nfell upon him a sort of spell which is his tragedy and the English\ntragedy, and, in no small degree, the German tragedy too. The real\nromance of the Teutons was largely a romance of the Southern Teutons,\nwith their castles, which are almost literally castles in the air, and\ntheir river which is walled with vineyards and rhymes so naturally to\nwine. But as Carlyle’s was rootedly a romance of conquest, he had to\nprove that the thing which conquered in Germany was really more poetical\nthan anything else in Germany. Now the thing that conquered in Germany\nwas about the most prosaic thing of which the world ever grew weary.\nThere is a great deal more poetry in Brixton than in Berlin. Stella said\nthat Swift could write charmingly about a broom-stick; and poor Carlyle\nhad to write romantically about a ramrod. Compare him with Heine, who\nhad also a detached taste in the mystical grotesques of Germany, but who\nsaw what was their enemy: and offered to nail up the Prussian eagle like\nan old crow as a target for the archers of the Rhine. Its prosaic\nessence is not proved by the fact that it did not produce poets: it is\nproved by the more deadly fact that it did. The actual written poetry of\nFrederick the Great, for instance, was not even German or barbaric, but\nsimply feeble–and French. Thus Carlyle became continually gloomier as\nhis fit of the blues deepened into Prussian blues; nor can there be any\nwonder. His philosophy had brought out the result that the Prussian was\nthe first of Germans, and, therefore, the first of men. No wonder he\nlooked at the rest of us with little hope.",
        "But a stronger test was coming both for Carlyle and England. Prussia,\nplodding, policing, as materialist as mud, went on solidifying and\nstrengthening after unconquered Russia and unconquered England had\nrescued her where she lay prostrate under Napoleon. In this interval the\ntwo most important events were the Polish national revival, with which\nRussia was half inclined to be sympathetic, but Prussia was implacably\ncoercionist; and the positive refusal of the crown of a united Germany\nby the King of Prussia, simply because it was constitutionally offered\nby a free German Convention. Prussia did not want to lead the Germans:\nshe wanted to conquer the Germans. And she wanted to conquer other\npeople first. She had already found her brutal, if humorous, embodiment\nin Bismarck; and he began with a scheme full of brutality and not\nwithout humour. He took up, or rather pretended to take up, the claim of\nthe Prince of Augustenberg to duchies which were a quite lawful part of\nthe land of Denmark. In support of this small pretender he enlisted two\nlarge things, the Germanic body called the Bund and the Austrian Empire.\nIt is possibly needless to say that after he had seized the disputed\nprovinces by pure Prussian violence, he kicked out the Prince of\nAugustenberg, kicked out the German Bund, and finally kicked out the\nAustrian Empire too, in the sudden campaign of Sadowa. He was a good\nhusband and a good father; he did not paint in water colours; and of\nsuch is the Kingdom of Heaven. But the symbolic intensity of the\nincident was this. The Danes expected protection from England; and if\nthere had been any sincerity in the ideal side of our Teutonism they\nought to have had it. They ought to have had it even by the pedantries\nof the time, which already talked of Latin inferiority: and were never\nweary of explaining that the country of Richelieu could not rule and the\ncountry of Napoleon could not fight. But if it was necessary for\nwhosoever would be saved to be a Teuton, the Danes were more Teuton than\nthe Prussians. If it be a matter of vital importance to be descended\nfrom Vikings, the Danes really were descended from Vikings, while the\nPrussians were descended from mongrel Slavonic savages. If Protestantism\nbe progress, the Danes were Protestant; while they had attained quite\npeculiar success and wealth in that small ownership and intensive\ncultivation which is very commonly a boast of Catholic lands. They had\nin a quite arresting degree what was claimed for the Germanics as\nagainst Latin revolutionism: quiet freedom, quiet prosperity, a simple\nlove of fields and of the sea. But, moreover, by that coincidence which\ndogs this drama, the English of that Victorian epoch had found their\nfreshest impression of the northern spirit of infancy and wonder in the\nworks of a Danish man of genius, whose stories and sketches were so\npopular in England as almost to have become English. Good as Grimm’s\nFairy Tales were, they had been collected and not created by the modern\nGerman; they were a museum of things older than any nation, of the\ndateless age of once-upon-a-time. When the English romantics wanted to\nfind the folk-tale spirit still alive, they found it in the small\ncountry of one of those small kings, with whom the folk-tales are almost\ncomically crowded. There they found what we call an original writer, who\nwas nevertheless the image of the origins. They found a whole fairyland\nin one head and under one nineteenth-century top hat. Those of the\nEnglish who were then children owe to Hans Andersen more than to any of\ntheir own writers, that essential educational emotion which feels that\ndomesticity is not dull but rather fantastic; that sense of the\nfairyland of furniture, and the travel and adventure of the farmyard.\nHis treatment of inanimate things as animate was not a cold and awkward\nallegory: it was a true sense of a dumb divinity in things that are.\nThrough him a child did feel that the chair he sat on was something like\na wooden horse. Through him children and the happier kind of men did\nfeel themselves covered by a roof as by the folded wings of some vast\ndomestic fowl; and feel common doors like great mouths that opened to\nutter welcome. In the story of “The Fir Tree” he transplanted to\nEngland a living bush that can still blossom into candles. And in his\ntale of “The Tin Soldier” he uttered the true defence of romantic\nmilitarism against the prigs who would forbid it even as a toy for the\nnursery. He suggested, in the true tradition of the folk-tales, that the\ndignity of the fighter is not in his largeness but rather in his\nsmallness, in his stiff loyalty and heroic helplessness in the hands of\nlarger and lower things. These things, alas, were an allegory. When\nPrussia, finding her crimes unpunished, afterwards carried them into\nFrance as well as Denmark, Carlyle and his school made some effort to\njustify their Germanism, by pitting what they called the piety and\nsimplicity of Germany against what they called the cynicism and ribaldry\nof France. But nobody could possibly pretend that Bismarck was more\npious and simple than Hans Andersen; yet the Carlyleans looked on with\nsilence or approval while the innocent toy kingdom was broken like a\ntoy. Here again, it is enormously probable that England would have\nstruck upon the right side, if the English people had been the English\nGovernment. Among other coincidences, the Danish princess who had\nmarried the English heir was something very like a fairy princess to the\nEnglish crowd. The national poet had hailed her as a daughter of the\nsea-kings; and she was, and indeed still is, the most popular royal\nfigure in England. But whatever our people may have been like, our\npoliticians were on the very tamest level of timidity and the fear of\nforce to which they have ever sunk. The Tin Soldier of the Danish army\nand the paper boat of the Danish navy, as in the story, were swept away\ndown the great gutter, down that colossal cloaca that leads to the\nvast cesspool of Berlin.",
        "Why, as a fact, did not England interpose? There were a great many\nreasons given, but I think they were all various inferences from one\nreason; indirect results and sometimes quite illogical results, of what\nwe have called the Germanisation of England. First, the very insularity\non which we insisted was barbaric, in its refusal of a seat in the\ncentral senate of the nations. What we called our splendid isolation\nbecame a rather ignominious sleeping-partnership with Prussia. Next, we\nwere largely trained in irresponsibility by our contemporary historians,\nFreeman and Green, teaching us to be proud of a possible descent from\nKing Arthur’s nameless enemies and not from King Arthur. King Arthur\nmight not be historical, but at least he was legendary. Hengist and\nHorsa were not even legendary, for they left no legend. Anybody could\nsee what was obligatory on the representative of Arthur; he was bound to\nbe chivalrous, that is, to be European. But nobody could imagine what\nwas obligatory on the representative of Horsa, unless it were to be\nhorsy. That was perhaps the only part of the Anglo-Saxon programme that\nthe contemporary English really carried out. Then, in the very real\ndecline from Cobbett to Cobden (that is, from a broad to a narrow\nmanliness and good sense) there had grown up the cult of a very curious\nkind of peace, to be spread all over the world not by pilgrims, but by\npedlars. Mystics from the beginning had made vows of peace–but they\nadded to them vows of poverty. Vows of poverty were not in the\nCobdenite’s line. Then, again, there was the positive praise of Prussia,\nto which steadily worsening case the Carlyleans were already committed.\nBut beyond these, there was something else, a spirit which had more\ninfected us as a whole. That spirit was the spirit of Hamlet. We gave\nthe grand name of “evolution” to a notion that things do themselves. Our\nwealth, our insularity, our gradual loss of faith, had so dazed us that\nthe old Christian England haunted us like a ghost in whom we could not\nquite believe. An aristocrat like Palmerston, loving freedom and hating\nthe upstart despotism, must have looked on at its cold brutality not\nwithout that ugly question which Hamlet asked himself–am I a coward?",
        "                      It cannot be\n  But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall\n  To make oppression bitter; or ’ere this\n  I should have fatted all the region kites\n  With this slave’s offal.",
        "We made dumb our anger and our honour; but it has not brought us peace.",
        "VII–The Midnight of Europe\nAmong the minor crimes of England may be classed the shallow criticism\nand easy abandonment of Napoleon III. The Victorian English had a very\nbad habit of being influenced by words and at the same time pretending\nto despise them. They would build their whole historical philosophy upon\ntwo or three titles, and then refuse to get even the titles right. The\nsolid Victorian Englishman, with his whiskers and his Parliamentary\nvote, was quite content to say that Louis Napoleon and William of\nPrussia both became Emperors–by which he meant autocrats. His whiskers\nwould have bristled with rage and he would have stormed at you for\nhair-splitting and “lingo,” if you had answered that William was German\nEmperor, while Napoleon was not French Emperor, but only Emperor of the\nFrench. What could such mere order of the words matter? Yet the same\nVictorian would have been even more indignant if he had been asked to\nbe satisfied with an Art Master, when he had advertised for a Master of\nArts. His irritation would have increased if the Art Master had promised\nhim a sea-piece and had brought him a piece of the sea; or if, during\nthe decoration of his house, the same aesthetic humourist had undertaken\nto procure some Indian Red and had produced a Red Indian.",
        "The Englishman would not see that if there was only a verbal difference\nbetween the French Emperor and the Emperor of the French, so, if it came\nto that, it was a verbal difference between the Emperor and the\nRepublic, or even between a Parliament and no Parliament. For him an\nEmperor meant merely despotism; he had not yet learned that a Parliament\nmay mean merely oligarchy. He did not know that the English people would\nsoon be made impotent, not by the disfranchising of their constituents,\nbut simply by the silencing of their members; and that the governing\nclass of England did not now depend upon rotten boroughs, but upon\nrotten representatives. Therefore he did not understand Bonapartism. He\ndid not understand that French democracy became more democratic, not\nless, when it turned all France into one constituency which elected one\nmember. He did not understand that many dragged down the Republic\nbecause it was not republican, but purely senatorial. He was yet to\nlearn how quite corruptly senatorial a great representative assembly can\nbecome. Yet in England to-day we hear “the decline of Parliament” talked\nabout and taken for granted by the best Parliamentarians–Mr. Balfour,\nfor instance–and we hear the one partly French and wholly Jacobin\nhistorian of the French Revolution recommending for the English evil a\nrevival of the power of the Crown. It seems that so far from having left\nLouis Napoleon far behind in the grey dust of the dead despotisms, it is\nnot at all improbable that our most extreme revolutionary developments\nmay end where Louis Napoleon began.",
        "In other words, the Victorian Englishman did not understand the words\n“Emperor of the French.” The type of title was deliberately chosen to\nexpress the idea of an elective and popular origin; as against such a\nphrase as “the German Emperor,” which expresses an almost\ntranscendental tribal patriarchate, or such a phrase as “King of\nPrussia,” which suggests personal ownership of a whole territory. To\ntreat the Coup d’etat as unpardonable is to justify riot against\ndespotism, but forbid any riot against aristocracy. Yet the idea\nexpressed in “The Emperor of the French” is not dead, but rather risen\nfrom the dead. It is the idea that while a government may pretend to be\na popular government, only a person can be really popular. Indeed, the\nidea is still the crown of American democracy, as it was for a time the\ncrown of French democracy. The very powerful official who makes the\nchoice of that great people for peace or war, might very well be called,\nnot the President of the United States, but the President of the\nAmericans. In Italy we have seen the King and the mob prevail over the\nconservatism of the Parliament, and in Russia the new popular policy\nsacramentally symbolised by the Czar riding at the head of the new\narmies. But in one place, at least, the actual form of words exists; and\nthe actual form of words has been splendidly justified. One man among\nthe sons of men has been permitted to fulfil a courtly formula with\nawful and disastrous fidelity. Political and geographical ruin have\nwritten one last royal title across the sky; the loss of palace and\ncapital and territory have but isolated and made evident the people that\nhas not been lost; not laws but the love of exiles, not soil but the\nsouls of men, still make certain that five true words shall yet be\nwritten in the corrupt and fanciful chronicles of mankind: “The King of\nthe Belgians.”",
        "It is a common phrase, recurring constantly in the real if rabid\neloquence of Victor Hugo, that Napoleon III. was a mere ape of Napoleon\nI. That is, that he had, as the politician says, in “L’Aiglon,” “le\npetit chapeau, mais pas la tete\"; that he was merely a bad imitation.\nThis is extravagantly exaggerative; and those who say it, moreover,\noften miss the two or three points of resemblance which really exist in\nthe exaggeration. One resemblance there certainly was. In both Napoleons\nit has been suggested that the glory was not so great as it seemed; but\nin both it can be emphatically added that the eclipse was not so great\nas it seemed either. Both succeeded at first and failed at last. But\nboth succeeded at last, even after the failure. If at this moment we owe\nthanks to Napoleon Bonaparte for the armies of united France, we also\nowe some thanks to Louis Bonaparte for the armies of united Italy. That\ngreat movement to a freer and more chivalrous Europe which we call\nto-day the Cause of the Allies, had its forerunners and first victories\nbefore our time; and it not only won at Arcola, but also at Solferino.\nMen who remembered Louis Napoleon when he mooned about the Blessington\nsalon, and was supposed to be almost mentally deficient, used to say\nhe deceived Europe twice; once when he made men think him an imbecile,\nand once when he made them think him a statesman. But he deceived them a\nthird time; when he made them think he was dead; and had done nothing.",
        "In spite of the unbridled verse of Hugo and the even more unbridled\nprose of Kinglake, Napoleon III. is really and solely discredited in\nhistory because of the catastrophe of 1870. Hugo hurled any amount of\nlightning on Louis Napoleon; but he threw very little light on him. Some\npassages in the “Chatiments” are really caricatures carved in eternal\nmarble. They will always be valuable in reminding generations too vague\nand soft, as were the Victorians, of the great truth that hatred is\nbeautiful, when it is hatred of the ugliness of the soul. But most of\nthem could have been written about Haman, or Heliogabalus, or King John,\nor Queen Elizabeth, as much as about poor Louis Napoleon; they bear no\ntrace of any comprehension of his quite interesting aims, and his quite\ncomprehensible contempt for the fat-souled senatorial politicians. And\nif a real revolutionist like Hugo did not do justice to the\nrevolutionary element in Caesarism, it need hardly be said that a rather\nPrimrose League Tory like Tennyson did not. Kinglake’s curiously acrid\ninsistence upon the Coup d’etat is, I fear, only an indulgence in one\nof the least pleasing pleasures of our national pen and press, and one\nwhich afterwards altogether ran away with us over the Dreyfus case. It\nis an unfortunate habit of publicly repenting for other people’s sins.\nIf this came easy to an Englishman like Kinglake, it came, of course,\nstill easier to a German like Queen Victoria’s husband and even to\nQueen Victoria herself, who was naturally influenced by him. But in so\nfar as the sensible masses of the English nation took any interest in\nthe matter, it is probable that they sympathised with Palmerston, who\nwas as popular as the Prince Consort was unpopular. The black mark\nagainst Louis Napoleon’s name until now, has simply been Sedan; and it\nis our whole purpose to-day to turn Sedan into an interlude. If it is\nnot an interlude, it will be the end of the world. But we have sworn to\nmake an end of that ending: warring on until, if only by a purgatory of\nthe nations and the mountainous annihilation of men, the story of the\nworld ends well.",
        "There are, as it were, valleys of history quite close to us, but hidden\nby the closer hills. One, as we have seen, is that fold in the soft\nSurrey hills where Cobbett sleeps with his still-born English\nRevolution. Another is under that height called The Spy of Italy, where\na new Napoleon brought back the golden eagles against the black eagles\nof Austria. Yet that French adventure in support of the Italian\ninsurrection was very important; we are only beginning to understand\nits importance. It was a defiance to the German Reaction and 1870 was a\nsort of revenge for it, just as the Balkan victory was a defiance to the\nGerman Reaction and 1914 was the attempted revenge for it. It is true\nthat the French liberation of Italy was incomplete, the problem of the\nPapal States, for instance, being untouched by the Peace of Villafranca.\nThe volcanic but fruitful spirit of Italy had already produced that\nwonderful, wandering, and almost omnipresent personality whose red shirt\nwas to be a walking flag: Garibaldi. And many English Liberals\nsympathised with him and his extremists as against the peace. Palmerston\ncalled it “the peace that passeth all understanding”: but the profanity\nof that hilarious old heathen was nearer the mark than he knew: there\nwere really present some of those deep things which he did not\nunderstand. To quarrel with the Pope, but to compromise with him, was an\ninstinct with the Bonapartes; an instinct no Anglo-Saxon could be\nexpected to understand. They knew the truth; that Anti-Clericalism is\nnot a Protestant movement, but a Catholic mood. And after all the\nEnglish Liberals could not get their own Government to risk what the\nFrench Government had risked; and Napoleon III. might well have retorted\non Palmerston, his rival in international Liberalism, that half a war\nwas better than no fighting. Swinburne called Villafranca “The Halt\nbefore Rome,” and expressed a rhythmic impatience for the time when the\nworld",
        "  “Shall ring to the roar of the lion\n  Proclaiming Republican Rome.”",
        "But he might have remembered, after all, that it was not the British\nlion, that a British poet should have the right to say so imperiously,\n“Let him roar again. Let him roar again.”",
        "It is true that there was no clear call to England from Italy, as there\ncertainly was from Denmark. The great powers were not bound to help\nItaly to become a nation, as they were bound to support the unquestioned\nfact that Denmark was one. Indeed the great Italian patriot was to\nexperience both extremes of the English paradox, and, curiously enough,\nin connection with both the two national and anti-German causes. For\nItaly he gained the support of the English, but not the support of\nEngland. Not a few of our countrymen followed the red shirt; but not in\nthe red coat. And when he came to England, not to plead the cause of\nItaly but the cause of Denmark, the Italian found he was more popular\nwith the English than any Englishman. He made his way through a forest\nof salutations, which would willingly have turned itself into a forest\nof swords. But those who kept the sword kept it sheathed. For the ruling\nclass the valour of the Italian hero, like the beauty of the Danish\nPrincess, was a thing to be admired, that is enjoyed, like a novel–or a\nnewspaper. Palmerston was the very type of Pacifism, because he was the\nvery type of Jingoism. In spirit as restless as Garibaldi, he was in\npractice as cautious as Cobden. England had the most prudent\naristocracy, but the most reckless democracy in the world. It was, and\nis, the English contradiction, which has so much misrepresented us,\nespecially to the Irish. Our national captains were carpet knights; our\nknights errant were among the dismounted rabble. When an Austrian\ngeneral who had flogged women in the conquered provinces appeared in\nthe London streets, some common draymen off a cart behaved with the\ndirect quixotry of Sir Lancelot or Sir Galahad. He had beaten women and\nthey beat him. They regarded themselves simply as avengers of ladies in\ndistress, breaking the bloody whip of a German bully; just as Cobbett\nhad sought to break it when it was wielded over the men of England. The\nboorishness was in the Germanic or half-Germanic rulers who wore crosses\nand spurs: the gallantry was in the gutter. English draymen had more\nchivalry than Teuton aristocrats–or English ones.",
        "I have dwelt a little on this Italian experiment because it lights up\nLouis Napoleon as what he really was before the eclipse, a\npolitician–perhaps an unscrupulous politician–but certainly a\ndemocratic politician. A power seldom falls being wholly faultless; and\nit is true that the Second Empire became contaminated with cosmopolitan\nspies and swindlers, justly reviled by such democrats as Rochefort as\nwell as Hugo. But there was no French inefficiency that weighed a hair\nin the balance compared with the huge and hostile efficiency of\nPrussia; the tall machine that had struck down Denmark and Austria, and\nnow stood ready to strike again, extinguishing the lamp of the world.\nThere was a hitch before the hammer stroke, and Bismarck adjusted it, as\nwith his finger, by a forgery–for he had many minor accomplishments.\nFrance fell: and what fell with her was freedom, and what reigned in her\nstead only tyrants and the ancient terror. The crowning of the first\nmodern Kaiser in the very palace of the old French kings was an\nallegory; like an allegory on those Versailles walls. For it was at once\nthe lifting of the old despotic diadem and its descent on the low brow\nof a barbarian. Louis XI. had returned, and not Louis IX.; and Europe\nwas to know that sceptre on which there is no dove.",
        "The instant evidence that Europe was in the grip of the savage was as\nsimple as it was sinister. The invaders behaved with an innocent impiety\nand bestiality that had never been known in those lands since Clovis was\nsigned with the cross. To the naked pride of the new men nations simply\nwere not. The struggling populations of two vast provinces were simply\ncarried away like slaves into captivity, as after the sacking of some\nprehistoric town. France was fined for having pretended to be a nation;\nand the fine was planned to ruin her forever. Under the pressure of such\nimpossible injustice France cried out to the Christian nations, one\nafter another, and by name. Her last cry ended in a stillness like that\nwhich had encircled Denmark.",
        "One man answered; one who had quarrelled with the French and their\nEmperor; but who knew it was not an emperor that had fallen. Garibaldi,\nnot always wise but to his end a hero, took his station, sword in hand,\nunder the darkening sky of Christendom, and shared the last fate of\nFrance. A curious record remains, in which a German commander testifies\nto the energy and effect of the last strokes of the wounded lion of\nAspromonte. But England went away sorrowful, for she had great\npossessions.",
