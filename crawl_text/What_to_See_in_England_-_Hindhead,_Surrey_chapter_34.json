        "The Hindhead district, not long ago one of the wildest in the home\ncounties, has of late been much encroached upon by the erection of\nmodern villas and houses. A few years back there was scarcely a vestige\nof human habitation to be seen from the road skirting the “Devil’s\nPunchbowl,” or the descent on the other side, but since the time\nProfessor Tyndall built his house there, the aspect of the country has\nbeen in places considerably changed.",
        "From Haslemere Station one may take a direct road to the Hindhead\nsummit, but the most interesting route is through Shottermill, about a\nmile distant (see p. 64). From here an easy walk takes one into the main\nPortsmouth road close to the Seven Thorns Inn, where there is a long\nascent to the summit of Hindhead, with its inn, the Royal Huts Hotel.\nClose by is the village of Grayshott, now fast growing into a place of\nconsiderable residential importance. Following the road Londonwards, one\narrives in a few hundred yards at the very highest point of the road\nover Hindhead, after which it drops gently, skirting the magnificent\nhollow known as the “Devil’s Punchbowl.” On the left-hand side, in the\nloneliest part of the road, is the gruesome tombstone which marks the\nspot where an unknown sailor was murdered and robbed while tramping from\nPortsmouth to London. This stone and its surroundings, it will be\nremembered, are mentioned in Nicholas Nickleby, in the account of the\nwalk of Nicholas and Smike from London to Portsmouth. Close by, on the\nopposite side of the road, there is a rough sandy track–once the old\ncoach road–which leads up to the stone cross on the extreme summit of\nthe Hindhead–900 feet above sea-level–where the murderers of the\nsailor were executed, and hung in chains. The view from this point,\naptly named Gibbet Hill, is quite magnificent for Surrey.",
        "On the northern slope of Blackdown–the high ridge of hills towards the\nsouth-east–is Aldworth House, where Tennyson resided in his latter\nyears.",
