        "Himself did then Sir Dietrich / his armor take in hand,\nTo don the which did help him / Master Hildebrand.\nThe doughty chieftain meanwhile / must make so loud complain\nThat from high palace casement / oft came back the sound again.",
        "2325",
        "Natheless his proper humor / soon he did regain,\nAnd armed full in anger / stood the worthy thane;\nA shield all wrought full firmly / took he straight in hand,\nAnd forth they strode together, / he and Master Hildebrand.",
        "2326",
        "Spake then of Tronje Hagen: / “Lo, where doth hither wend\nIn wrath his way Sir Dietrich. / ’Tis plain he doth intend\nOn us to wreak sore vengeance / for harm befallen here.\nTo-day be full decided / who may the prize for valor bear!",
        "2327",
        "“Let ne’er of Bern Sir Dietrich / hold him so high of might\nNor deem his arm so doughty / and terrible in fight\nThat, will he wreak his anger / on us for sorest scathe,\"–\nSuch were the words of Hagen, / –\"I dare not well withstand his wrath.”",
        "2328",
        "Upon these words defiant / left Dietrich Hildebrand,\nAnd to the warriors hither / came where both did stand\nWithout before the palace, / and leaning respite found.\nHis shield well proved in battle / Sir Dietrich lowered to the ground.",
        "2329",
        "Addressed to them Sir Dietrich / these words of sorrowing:\n“Wherefore hast thou such evil, / Gunther mighty king,\nWrought ’gainst me a stranger? / What had I done to thee,\nOf my every comfort / in such manner reft to be?",
        "2330",
        "“Seemed then not sufficient / the havoc unto you\nWhen from us the hero / Ruediger ye slew,\nThat now from me ye’ve taken / my warriors one and all?\nThrough me did so great sorrow / ne’er to you good knights befall.",
        "2331",
        "“Of your own selves bethink you / and what the scathe ye bore,\nThe death of your companions / and all your travail sore,\nIf not your hearts, good warriors, / thereat do heavy grow.\nThat Ruediger hath fallen, / –ah me! how fills my heart with woe!",
        "2332",
        "“In all this world to any / more sorrow ne’er befell,\nYet have ye minded little / my loss and yours as well.\nWhate’er I most rejoiced in / beneath your hands lies slain;\nYea, for my kinsmen fallen / never may I cease to plain.”",
        "2333",
        "“No guilt lies here upon us,\" / Hagen in answer spake.\n“Unto this hall hither / your knights their way did take,\nWith goodly train of warriors / full armed for the fight.\nMeseemeth that the story / hath not been told to thee aright.”",
        "2334",
        "“What shall I else believe in? / To me told Hildebrand\nHow, when the knights that serve me / of Amelungenland\nDid beg the corse of Ruediger / to give them from the hall,\nNought offered ye but mockings / unto the valiant warriors all.”",
        "2335",
        "Then spake the King of Rhineland: / “Ruediger to bear away\nCame they in company hither; / whose corse to them deny\nI bade, despiting Etzel, / nor with aught malice more,\nWhereupon did Wolfhart / begin to rage thereat full sore.”",
        "2336",
        "Then spake of Bern the hero: / “’Twas fated so to be.\nYet Gunther, noble monarch, / by thy kingly courtesy\nAmends make for the sorrow / thou here on me hast wrought,\nThat so thy knightly honor / still unsullied be in aught.",
        "2337",
        "“Then yield to me as hostage / thyself and eke thy man;\nSo will I surely hinder, / as with best might I can,\nThat any here in Hunland / harm unto thee shall do:\nHenceforward shalt thou find me / ever well disposed and true.”",
        "2338",
        "“God in heaven forfend it,\" / Hagen spake again,\n“That unto thee should yield them / ever warriors twain\nWho in their strength reliant / all armed before thee stand,\nAnd yet ’fore foes defiant / may freely swing a blade in hand.”",
        "2339",
        "“So shall ye not,” spake Dietrich, / “proffered peace forswear,\nGunther and Hagen. / Misfortune such I bear\nAt both your hands, ’tis certain / ye did but do aright,\nWould ye for so great sorrow / now my heart in full requite.",
        "2340",
        "“I give you my sure promise / and pledge thereto my hand\nThat I will bear you escort / home unto your land;\nWith honors fit I’ll lead you, / thereon my life I set,\nAnd for your sake sore evil / suffered at your hands forget.”",
        "2341",
        "“Ask thou such thing no longer,\" / Hagen then replied.\n“For us ’twere little fitting / the tale be bruited wide,\nThat twain of doughty warriors / did yield them ’neath thy hand.\nBeside thee is none other / now but only Hildebrand.”",
        "2342",
        "Then answered Master Hildebrand: / “The hour may come, God wot,\nSir Hagen, when thus lightly / disdain it thou shalt not\nIf any man such offer / of peace shall make to thee.\nWelcome might now my master’s / reconciliation be.”",
        "2343",
        "“I’d take in sooth his friendship,\" / Hagen gave reply,\n“Ere that I so basely / forth from a hall would fly.\nAs thou hast done but lately, / O Master Hildebrand.\nI weened with greater valor / couldst thou ’fore a foeman stand.”",
        "2344",
        "Thereto gave answer Hildebrand: / “From thee reproach like that?\nWho was then on shield so idle / ’fore the Waskenstein that sat,\nThe while that Spanish Walter / friend after friend laid low?\nSuch valor thou in plenty / hast in thine own self to show.”",
        "2345",
        "Outspake then Sir Dietrich: / “Ill fits it warriors bold\nThat they one another / like old wives should scold.\nThee forbid I, Hildebrand, / aught to parley more.\nAh me, most sad misfortune / weigheth on my heart full sore.",
        "2346",
        "“Let me hear, Sir Hagen,\" / Dietrich further spake,\n“What boast ye doughty warriors / did there together make,\nWhen that ye saw me hither / come with sword in hand?\nThought ye then not singly / me in combat to withstand?”",
        "2347",
        "“In sooth denieth no one,\" / bold Sir Hagen spake,\n“That of the same with sword-blow / I would trial make,\nAn but the sword of Niblung / burst not within my hand.\nYea, scorn I that to yield us / thus haughtily thou mak’st demand.”",
        "2348",
        "When Dietrich now perceived / how Hagen raged amain,\nRaise his shield full quickly / did the doughty thane.\nAs quick upon him Hagen / adown the perron sprang,\nAnd the trusty sword of Niblung / full loud on Dietrich’s armor rang.",
        "2349",
        "Then knew full well Sir Dietrich / that the warrior keen\nSavage was of humor, / and best himself to screen\nSought of Bern the hero / from many a murderous blow,\nWhereby the valiant Hagen / straightway came he well to know.",
        "2350",
        "Eke fear he had of Balmung, / a strong and trusty blade.\nEach blow meanwhile Sir Dietrich / with cunning art repaid,\nTill that he dealt to Hagen / a wound both deep and long,\nWhereat give o’er the struggle / must the valiant knight and strong.",
        "2351",
        "Bethought him then Sir Dietrich: / “Through toil thy strength has fled,\nAnd little honor had I / shouldst thou lie before me dead.\nSo will I yet make trial / if I may not subdue\nThee unto me as hostage.\" / Light task ’twas not the same to do.",
        "2352",
        "His shield down cast he from him / and with what strength he found\nAbout the knight of Tronje / fast his arms he wound.\nIn such wise was subdued / by him the doughty knight;\nGunther the noble monarch / did weep to see his sorry plight.",
        "2353",
        "Bind Hagen then did Dietrich, / and led him where did stand\nKriemhild the royal lady, / and gave into her hand\nOf all the bravest warrior / that ever weapon bore.\nAfter her mickle sorrow / had she merry heart once more.",
        "2354",
        "For joy before Sir Dietrich / bent royal Etzel’s wife:\n“Blessed be thou ever / in heart while lasteth life.\nThrough thee is now forgotten / all my dire need;\nAn death do not prevent me, / from me shall ever be thy meed.”",
        "2355",
        "Then spake to her Sir Dietrich, / “Take not his life away,\nHigh and royal lady, / for full will he repay\nThee for the mickle evil / on thee have wrought his hands.\nBe it not his misfortune / that bound before thee here he stands.”",
        "2356",
        "Then bade she forth lead Hagen / to dungeon keep near by,\nWherein he lay fast bolted / and hid from every eye.\nGunther, the noble monarch, / with loudest voice did say:\n“The knight of Bern who wrongs me, / whither hath he fled away?”",
        "2357",
        "Meanwhile back towards him / the doughty Dietrich came,\nAnd found the royal Gunther / a knight of worthy name.\nEke he might bide longer / but down to meet him sprang,\nAnd soon with angry clamor / their swords before the palace rang.",
        "2358",
        "How famed soe’er Sir Dietrich / and great the name he bore,\nWith wrath was filled King Gunther, / and eke did rage full sore\nAt thought of grievous sorrow / suffered at his hand:\nStill tell they as high wonder / how Dietrich might his blows withstand.",
        "2359",
        "In store of doughty valor / each did nothing lack.\nFrom palace and from tower / the din of blows came back\nAs on well-fastened helmets / the lusty swords came down,\nAnd royal Gunther’s valor / in the fight full clear was shown.",
        "2360",
        "The knight of Bern yet tamed him / as Hagen erst befell,\nAnd oozing through his armor / the blood was seen to swell\nFrom cut of sharpest weapon / in Dietrich’s arm that swung.\nRight worthily King Gunther / had borne him after labors long.",
        "2361",
        "Bound was then the monarch / by Sir Dietrich’s hand,\nAlbeit bonds should suffer / ne’er king of any land.\nBut deemed he, if King Gunther / and Hagen yet were free,\nSecure might never any / from their searching vengeance be.",
        "2362",
        "When in such manner Dietrich / the king secure had bound\nBy the hand he led him / where Kriemhild he found.\nAt sight of his misfortune / did sorrow from her flee:\nQuoth she: “Welcome Gunther / from out the land of Burgundy.”",
        "2363",
        "He spake: “Then might I thank thee, / sister of high degree,\nWhen that some whit more gracious / might thy greeting be.\nSo angry art thou minded / ever yet, O queen,\nFull spare shall be thy greeting / to Hagen and to me, I ween.”",
        "2364",
        "Then spake of Bern the hero: / “Ne’er till now, O queen,\nGiven o’er as hostage / have knights so worthy been,\nAs I, O lofty lady, / in these have given to thee:\nI pray thee higher evils / to spare them now for sake of me.”",
        "2365",
        "She vowed to do it gladly. / Then forth Sir Dietrich went\nWith weeping eyes to see there / such knights’ imprisonment.\nIn grimmest ways thereafter / wreaked vengeance Etzel’s wife:\nBeneath her hand those chosen / warriors twain must end their life.",
        "2366",
        "She let them lie asunder / the less at ease to be,\nNor did each the other / thenceforward ever see\nTill that unto Hagen / her brother’s head she bore.\nIn sooth did Kriemhild vengeance / wreak upon the twain full sore.",
        "2367",
        "Forth where she should find Hagen / the queen her way did take,\nAnd in right angry manner / she to the warrior spake:\n“An thou wilt but restore me / that thou hast ta’en from me,\nSo may’st thou come yet living / home to the land of Burgundy.”",
        "2368",
        "Answered thereto grim Hagen: / “’Twere well thy breath to save,\nFull high and royal lady. / Sworn by my troth I have\nThat I the hoard will tell not; / the while that yet doth live\nOf my masters any, / the treasure unto none I’ll give.”",
        "2369",
        "“Then ended be the story,\" / the noble lady spake.\nShe bade them from her brother / straightway his life to take.\nHis head they struck from off him, / which by the hair she bore\nUnto the thane of Tronje. / Thereat did grieve the knight full sore.",
        "2370",
        "When that he in horror / his master’s head had seen,\nCried the doughty warrior / unto Kriemhild the queen:\n“Now is thy heart’s desire / at length accomplished.\nAnd eke hath all befallen / as my foreboding heart hath said.",
        "2371",
        "“Dead lieth now the noble / king of Burgundy,\nAlso youthful Giselher / and Sir Gernot eke doth he.\nThe treasure no one knoweth / but God and me alone,\nNor e’er by thee, she-devil, / shall its hiding-place be known.”",
        "2372",
        "Quoth she: “But ill requital / hast thou made to me.\nYet mine the sword of Siegfried / now henceforth shall be,\nThe which when last I saw him, / my loved husband bore,\nIn whom on me such sorrow / through guilt of thine doth weigh full sore.”",
        "2373",
        "She drew it from the scabbard, / nor might he say her nay,\nThough thought she from the warrior / his life to take away.\nWith both hands high she raised it / and off his head struck she,\nWhereat did grieve King Etzel / full sore the sorry sight to see.",
        "2374",
        "“To arms!” cried then the monarch: / “here lieth foully slain\nBeneath the hand of woman / of all the doughtiest thane\nThat e’er was seen in battle / or ever good shield bore!\nThough foeman howsoever, / yet grieveth this my heart full sore.”",
        "2375",
        "Quoth then the aged Hildebrand: / “Reap no gain she shall,\nThat thus she dared to slay him. / Whate’er to me befall,\nAnd though myself in direst / need through him have been,\nBy me shall be avenged / the death of Tronje’s knight full keen.”",
        "2376",
        "In wrathful mood then Hildebrand / unto Kriemhild sprung,\nAnd ’gainst the queen full swiftly / his massy blade he swung.\nAloud she then in terror / ’fore Hildebrand did wail,\nYet that she shrieked so loudly, / to save her what might that avail?",
        "2377",
        "So all those warriors fated / by hand of death lay strewn,\nAnd e’en the queen full lofty / in pieces eke was hewn.\nDietrich and royal Etzel / at length to weep began,\nAnd grievously they mourned / kinsmen slain and many a man.",
        "2378",
        "Who late stood high in honor / now in death lay low,\nAnd fate of all the people / weeping was and woe.\nTo mourning now the monarch’s / festal tide had passed,\nAs falls that joy to sorrow / turneth ever at the last.",
        "2379",
        "Nor can I tell you further / what later did befall,\nBut that good knights and ladies / saw ye mourning all,\nAnd many a noble squire, / for friends in death laid low.\nHere hath the story ending, / –that is the Nibelungen woe.",
