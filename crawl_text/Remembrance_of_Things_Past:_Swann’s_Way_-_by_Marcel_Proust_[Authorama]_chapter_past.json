        "For a long time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put out\nmy candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to say\n\"I’m going to sleep.” And half an hour later the thought that it was time\nto go to sleep would awaken me; I would try to put away the book which, I\nimagined, was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I had been\nthinking all the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just been\nreading, but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own, until I\nmyself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book: a church, a\nquartet, the rivalry between François I and Charles V. This impression\nwould persist for some moments after I was awake; it did not disturb my\nmind, but it lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them from\nregistering the fact that the candle was no longer burning. Then it would\nbegin to seem unintelligible, as the thoughts of a former existence must\nbe to a reincarnate spirit; the subject of my book would separate itself\nfrom me, leaving me free to choose whether I would form part of it or no;\nand at the same time my sight would return and I would be astonished to\nfind myself in a state of darkness, pleasant and restful enough for the\neyes, and even more, perhaps, for my mind, to which it appeared\nincomprehensible, without a cause, a matter dark indeed.",
        "I would ask myself what o’clock it could be; I could hear the whistling of\ntrains, which, now nearer and now farther off, punctuating the distance\nlike the note of a bird in a forest, shewed me in perspective the deserted\ncountryside through which a traveller would be hurrying towards the\nnearest station: the path that he followed being fixed for ever in his\nmemory by the general excitement due to being in a strange place, to doing\nunusual things, to the last words of conversation, to farewells exchanged\nbeneath an unfamiliar lamp which echoed still in his ears amid the silence\nof the night; and to the delightful prospect of being once again at home.",
        "I would lay my cheeks gently against the comfortable cheeks of my pillow,\nas plump and blooming as the cheeks of babyhood. Or I would strike a match\nto look at my watch. Nearly midnight. The hour when an invalid, who has\nbeen obliged to start on a journey and to sleep in a strange hotel,\nawakens in a moment of illness and sees with glad relief a streak of\ndaylight shewing under his bedroom door. Oh, joy of joys! it is morning.\nThe servants will be about in a minute: he can ring, and some one will\ncome to look after him. The thought of being made comfortable gives him\nstrength to endure his pain. He is certain he heard footsteps: they come\nnearer, and then die away. The ray of light beneath his door is\nextinguished. It is midnight; some one has turned out the gas; the last\nservant has gone to bed, and he must lie all night in agony with no one to\nbring him any help.",
        "I would fall asleep, and often I would be awake again for short snatches\nonly, just long enough to hear the regular creaking of the wainscot, or to\nopen my eyes to settle the shifting kaleidoscope of the darkness, to\nsavour, in an instantaneous flash of perception, the sleep which lay heavy\nupon the furniture, the room, the whole surroundings of which I formed but\nan insignificant part and whose unconsciousness I should very soon return\nto share. Or, perhaps, while I was asleep I had returned without the least\neffort to an earlier stage in my life, now for ever outgrown; and had come\nunder the thrall of one of my childish terrors, such as that old terror of\nmy great-uncle’s pulling my curls, which was effectually dispelled on the\nday–the dawn of a new era to me–on which they were finally cropped from\nmy head. I had forgotten that event during my sleep; I remembered it again\nimmediately I had succeeded in making myself wake up to escape my\ngreat-uncle’s fingers; still, as a measure of precaution, I would bury the\nwhole of my head in the pillow before returning to the world of dreams.",
        "Sometimes, too, just as Eve was created from a rib of Adam, so a woman\nwould come into existence while I was sleeping, conceived from some strain\nin the position of my limbs. Formed by the appetite that I was on the\npoint of gratifying, she it was, I imagined, who offered me that\ngratification. My body, conscious that its own warmth was permeating hers,\nwould strive to become one with her, and I would awake. The rest of\nhumanity seemed very remote in comparison with this woman whose company I\nhad left but a moment ago: my cheek was still warm with her kiss, my body\nbent beneath the weight of hers. If, as would sometimes happen, she had\nthe appearance of some woman whom I had known in waking hours, I would\nabandon myself altogether to the sole quest of her, like people who set\nout on a journey to see with their own eyes some city that they have\nalways longed to visit, and imagine that they can taste in reality what\nhas charmed their fancy. And then, gradually, the memory of her would\ndissolve and vanish, until I had forgotten the maiden of my dream.",
        "When a man is asleep, he has in a circle round him the chain of the hours,\nthe sequence of the years, the order of the heavenly host. Instinctively,\nwhen he awakes, he looks to these, and in an instant reads off his own\nposition on the earth’s surface and the amount of time that has elapsed\nduring his slumbers; but this ordered procession is apt to grow confused,\nand to break its ranks. Suppose that, towards morning, after a night of\ninsomnia, sleep descends upon him while he is reading, in quite a\ndifferent position from that in which he normally goes to sleep, he has\nonly to lift his arm to arrest the sun and turn it back in its course,\nand, at the moment of waking, he will have no idea of the time, but will\nconclude that he has just gone to bed. Or suppose that he gets drowsy in\nsome even more abnormal position; sitting in an armchair, say, after\ndinner: then the world will fall topsy-turvy from its orbit, the magic\nchair will carry him at full speed through time and space, and when he\nopens his eyes again he will imagine that he went to sleep months earlier\nand in some far distant country. But for me it was enough if, in my own\nbed, my sleep was so heavy as completely to relax my consciousness; for\nthen I lost all sense of the place in which I had gone to sleep, and when\nI awoke at midnight, not knowing where I was, I could not be sure at first\nwho I was; I had only the most rudimentary sense of existence, such as may\nlurk and flicker in the depths of an animal’s consciousness; I was more\ndestitute of human qualities than the cave-dweller; but then the memory,\nnot yet of the place in which I was, but of various other places where I\nhad lived, and might now very possibly be, would come like a rope let down\nfrom heaven to draw me up out of the abyss of not-being, from which I\ncould never have escaped by myself: in a flash I would traverse and\nsurmount centuries of civilisation, and out of a half-visualised\nsuccession of oil-lamps, followed by shirts with turned-down collars,\nwould put together by degrees the component parts of my ego.",
        "Perhaps the immobility of the things that surround us is forced upon them\nby our conviction that they are themselves, and not anything else, and by\nthe immobility of our conceptions of them. For it always happened that\nwhen I awoke like this, and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt\nto discover where I was, everything would be moving round me through the\ndarkness: things, places, years. My body, still too heavy with sleep to\nmove, would make an effort to construe the form which its tiredness took\nas an orientation of its various members, so as to induce from that where\nthe wall lay and the furniture stood, to piece together and to give a name\nto the house in which it must be living. Its memory, the composite memory\nof its ribs, knees, and shoulder-blades offered it a whole series of rooms\nin which it had at one time or another slept; while the unseen walls kept\nchanging, adapting themselves to the shape of each successive room that it\nremembered, whirling madly through the darkness. And even before my brain,\nlingering in consideration of when things had happened and of what they\nhad looked like, had collected sufficient impressions to enable it to\nidentify the room, it, my body, would recall from each room in succession\nwhat the bed was like, where the doors were, how daylight came in at the\nwindows, whether there was a passage outside, what I had had in my mind\nwhen I went to sleep, and had found there when I awoke. The stiffened side\nunderneath my body would, for instance, in trying to fix its position,\nimagine itself to be lying, face to the wall, in a big bed with a canopy;\nand at once I would say to myself, “Why, I must have gone to sleep after\nall, and Mamma never came to say good night!” for I was in the country\nwith my grandfather, who died years ago; and my body, the side upon which\nI was lying, loyally preserving from the past an impression which my mind\nshould never have forgotten, brought back before my eyes the glimmering\nflame of the night-light in its bowl of Bohemian glass, shaped like an urn\nand hung by chains from the ceiling, and the chimney-piece of Siena marble\nin my bedroom at Combray, in my great-aunt’s house, in those far distant\ndays which, at the moment of waking, seemed present without being clearly\ndenned, but would become plainer in a little while when I was properly\nawake.",
        "Then would come up the memory of a fresh position; the wall slid away in\nanother direction; I was in my room in Mme. de Saint-Loup’s house in the\ncountry; good heavens, it must be ten o’clock, they will have finished\ndinner! I must have overslept myself, in the little nap which I always\ntake when I come in from my walk with Mme. de Saint-Loup, before dressing\nfor the evening. For many years have now elapsed since the Combray days,\nwhen, coming in from the longest and latest walks, I would still be in\ntime to see the reflection of the sunset glowing in the panes of my\nbedroom window. It is a very different kind of existence at Tansonville\nnow with Mme. de Saint-Loup, and a different kind of pleasure that I now\nderive from taking walks only in the evenings, from visiting by moonlight\nthe roads on which I used to play, as a child, in the sunshine; while the\nbedroom, in which I shall presently fall asleep instead of dressing for\ndinner, from afar off I can see it, as we return from our walk, with its\nlamp shining through the window, a solitary beacon in the night.",
        "These shifting and confused gusts of memory never lasted for more than a\nfew seconds; it often happened that, in my spell of uncertainty as to\nwhere I was, I did not distinguish the successive theories of which that\nuncertainty was composed any more than, when we watch a horse running, we\nisolate the successive positions of its body as they appear upon a\nbioscope.  But I had seen first one and then another of the rooms in which\nI had slept during my life, and in the end I would revisit them all in the\nlong course of my waking dream: rooms in winter, where on going to bed I\nwould at once bury my head in a nest, built up out of the most diverse\nmaterials, the corner of my pillow, the top of my blankets, a piece of a\nshawl, the edge of my bed, and a copy of an evening paper, all of which\nthings I would contrive, with the infinite patience of birds building\ntheir nests, to cement into one whole; rooms where, in a keen frost, I\nwould feel the satisfaction of being shut in from the outer world (like\nthe sea-swallow which builds at the end of a dark tunnel and is kept warm\nby the surrounding earth), and where, the fire keeping in all night, I\nwould sleep wrapped up, as it were, in a great cloak of snug and savoury\nair, shot with the glow of the logs which would break out again in flame:\nin a sort of alcove without walls, a cave of warmth dug out of the heart\nof the room itself, a zone of heat whose boundaries were constantly\nshifting and altering in temperature as gusts of air ran across them to\nstrike freshly upon my face, from the corners of the room, or from parts\nnear the window or far from the fireplace which had therefore remained\ncold–or rooms in summer, where I would delight to feel myself a part of\nthe warm evening, where the moonlight striking upon the half-opened\nshutters would throw down to the foot of my bed its enchanted ladder;\nwhere I would fall asleep, as it might be in the open air, like a titmouse\nwhich the breeze keeps poised in the focus of a sunbeam–or sometimes the\nLouis XVI room, so cheerful that I could never feel really unhappy, even\non my first night in it: that room where the slender columns which lightly\nsupported its ceiling would part, ever so gracefully, to indicate where\nthe bed was and to keep it separate; sometimes again that little room with\nthe high ceiling, hollowed in the form of a pyramid out of two separate\nstoreys, and partly walled with mahogany, in which from the first moment\nmy mind was drugged by the unfamiliar scent of flowering grasses,\nconvinced of the hostility of the violet curtains and of the insolent\nindifference of a clock that chattered on at the top of its voice as\nthough I were not there; while a strange and pitiless mirror with square\nfeet, which stood across one corner of the room, cleared for itself a site\nI had not looked to find tenanted in the quiet surroundings of my normal\nfield of vision: that room in which my mind, forcing itself for hours on\nend to leave its moorings, to elongate itself upwards so as to take on the\nexact shape of the room, and to reach to the summit of that monstrous\nfunnel, had passed so many anxious nights while my body lay stretched out\nin bed, my eyes staring upwards, my ears straining, my nostrils sniffing\nuneasily, and my heart beating; until custom had changed the colour of the\ncurtains, made the clock keep quiet, brought an expression of pity to the\ncruel, slanting face of the glass, disguised or even completely dispelled\nthe scent of flowering grasses, and distinctly reduced the apparent\nloftiness of the ceiling. Custom! that skilful but unhurrying manager who\nbegins by torturing the mind for weeks on end with her provisional\narrangements; whom the mind, for all that, is fortunate in discovering,\nfor without the help of custom it would never contrive, by its own\nefforts, to make any room seem habitable.",
        "Certainly I was now well awake; my body had turned about for the last time\nand the good angel of certainty had made all the surrounding objects stand\nstill, had set me down under my bedclothes, in my bedroom, and had fixed,\napproximately in their right places in the uncertain light, my chest of\ndrawers, my writing-table, my fireplace, the window overlooking the\nstreet, and both the doors. But it was no good my knowing that I was not\nin any of those houses of which, in the stupid moment of waking, if I had\nnot caught sight exactly, I could still believe in their possible\npresence; for memory was now set in motion; as a rule I did not attempt to\ngo to sleep again at once, but used to spend the greater part of the night\nrecalling our life in the old days at Combray with my great-aunt, at\nBalbec, Paris, Doncières, Venice, and the rest; remembering again all the\nplaces and people that I had known, what I had actually seen of them, and\nwhat others had told me.",
        "At Combray, as every afternoon ended, long before the time when I should\nhave to go up to bed, and to lie there, unsleeping, far from my mother and\ngrandmother, my bedroom became the fixed point on which my melancholy and\nanxious thoughts were centred. Some one had had the happy idea of giving\nme, to distract me on evenings when I seemed abnormally wretched, a magic\nlantern, which used to be set on top of my lamp while we waited for\ndinner-time to come: in the manner of the master-builders and\nglass-painters of gothic days it substituted for the opaqueness of my\nwalls an impalpable iridescence, supernatural phenomena of many colours,\nin which legends were depicted, as on a shifting and transitory window.\nBut my sorrows were only increased, because this change of lighting\ndestroyed, as nothing else could have done, the customary impression I had\nformed of my room, thanks to which the room itself, but for the torture of\nhaving to go to bed in it, had become quite endurable. For now I no longer\nrecognised it, and I became uneasy, as though I were in a room in some\nhotel or furnished lodging, in a place where I had just arrived, by train,\nfor the first time.",
        "Riding at a jerky trot, Golo, his mind filled with an infamous design,\nissued from the little three-cornered forest which dyed dark-green the\nslope of a convenient hill, and advanced by leaps and bounds towards the\ncastle of poor Geneviève de Brabant. This castle was cut off short by a\ncurved line which was in fact the circumference of one of the transparent\novals in the slides which were pushed into position through a slot in the\nlantern. It was only the wing of a castle, and in front of it stretched a\nmoor on which Geneviève stood, lost in contemplation, wearing a blue\ngirdle. The castle and the moor were yellow, but I could tell their colour\nwithout waiting to see them, for before the slides made their appearance\nthe old-gold sonorous name of Brabant had given me an unmistakable clue.\nGolo stopped for a moment and listened sadly to the little speech read\naloud by my great-aunt, which he seemed perfectly to understand, for he\nmodified his attitude with a docility not devoid of a degree of majesty,\nso as to conform to the indications given in the text; then he rode away\nat the same jerky trot. And nothing could arrest his slow progress. If the\nlantern were moved I could still distinguish Golo’s horse advancing across\nthe window-curtains, swelling out with their curves and diving into their\nfolds. The body of Golo himself, being of the same supernatural substance\nas his steed’s, overcame all material obstacles–everything that seemed to\nbar his way–by taking each as it might be a skeleton and embodying it in\nhimself: the door-handle, for instance, over which, adapting itself at\nonce, would float invincibly his red cloak or his pale face, never losing\nits nobility or its melancholy, never shewing any sign of trouble at such\na transubstantiation.",
        "And, indeed, I found plenty of charm in these bright projections, which\nseemed to have come straight out of a Merovingian past, and to shed around\nme the reflections of such ancient history. But I cannot express the\ndiscomfort I felt at such an intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room\nwhich I had succeeded in filling with my own personality until I thought\nno more of the room than of myself. The anaesthetic effect of custom being\ndestroyed, I would begin to think and to feel very melancholy things. The\ndoor-handle of my room, which was different to me from all the other\ndoorhandles in the world, inasmuch as it seemed to open of its own accord\nand without my having to turn it, so unconscious had its manipulation\nbecome; lo and behold, it was now an astral body for Golo. And as soon as\nthe dinner-bell rang I would run down to the dining-room, where the big\nhanging lamp, ignorant of Golo and Bluebeard but well acquainted with my\nfamily and the dish of stewed beef, shed the same light as on every other\nevening; and I would fall into the arms of my mother, whom the misfortunes\nof Geneviève de Brabant had made all the dearer to me, just as the crimes\nof Golo had driven me to a more than ordinarily scrupulous examination of\nmy own conscience.",
        "But after dinner, alas, I was soon obliged to leave Mamma, who stayed\ntalking with the others, in the garden if it was fine, or in the little\nparlour where everyone took shelter when it was wet. Everyone except my\ngrandmother, who held that “It is a pity to shut oneself indoors in the\ncountry,” and used to carry on endless discussions with my father on the\nvery wettest days, because he would send me up to my room with a book\ninstead of letting me stay out of doors. “That is not the way to make him\nstrong and active,” she would say sadly, “especially this little man, who\nneeds all the strength and character that he can get.” My father would\nshrug his shoulders and study the barometer, for he took an interest in\nmeteorology, while my mother, keeping very quiet so as not to disturb him,\nlooked at him with tender respect, but not too hard, not wishing to\npenetrate the mysteries of his superior mind. But my grandmother, in all\nweathers, even when the rain was coming down in torrents and Françoise had\nrushed indoors with the precious wicker armchairs, so that they should not\nget soaked–you would see my grandmother pacing the deserted garden,\nlashed by the storm, pushing back her grey hair in disorder so that her\nbrows might be more free to imbibe the life-giving draughts of wind and\nrain.  She would say, “At last one can breathe!” and would run up and down\nthe soaking paths–too straight and symmetrical for her liking, owing to\nthe want of any feeling for nature in the new gardener, whom my father had\nbeen asking all morning if the weather were going to improve–with her\nkeen, jerky little step regulated by the various effects wrought upon her\nsoul by the intoxication of the storm, the force of hygiene, the stupidity\nof my education and of symmetry in gardens, rather than by any anxiety\n(for that was quite unknown to her) to save her plum-coloured skirt from\nthe spots of mud under which it would gradually disappear to a depth which\nalways provided her maid with a fresh problem and filled her with fresh\ndespair.",
        "When these walks of my grandmother’s took place after dinner there was one\nthing which never failed to bring her back to the house: that was if (at\none of those points when the revolutions of her course brought her,\nmoth-like, in sight of the lamp in the little parlour where the liqueurs\nwere set out on the card-table) my great-aunt called out to her:\n\"Bathilde!  Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy!” For,\nsimply to tease her (she had brought so foreign a type of mind into my\nfather’s family that everyone made a joke of it), my great-aunt used to\nmake my grandfather, who was forbidden liqueurs, take just a few drops. My\npoor grandmother would come in and beg and implore her husband not to\ntaste the brandy; and he would become annoyed and swallow his few drops\nall the same, and she would go out again sad and discouraged, but still\nsmiling, for she was so humble and so sweet that her gentleness towards\nothers, and her continual subordination of herself and of her own\ntroubles, appeared on her face blended in a smile which, unlike those seen\non the majority of human faces, had no trace in it of irony, save for\nherself, while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes, which\ncould not look upon those she loved without yearning to bestow upon them\npassionate caresses. The torments inflicted on her by my great-aunt, the\nsight of my grandmother’s vain entreaties, of her in her weakness\nconquered before she began, but still making the futile endeavour to wean\nmy grandfather from his liqueur-glass–all these were things of the sort\nto which, in later years, one can grow so well accustomed as to smile at\nthem, to take the tormentor’s side with a. happy determination which\ndeludes one into the belief that it is not, really, tormenting; but in\nthose days they filled me with such horror that I longed to strike my\ngreat-aunt. And yet, as soon as I heard her “Bathilde!  Come in and stop\nyour husband from drinking brandy!” in my cowardice I became at once a\nman, and did what all we grown men do when face to face with suffering and\ninjustice; I preferred not to see them; I ran up to the top of the house\nto cry by myself in a little room beside the schoolroom and beneath the\nroof, which smelt of orris-root, and was scented also by a wild\ncurrant-bush which had climbed up between the stones of the outer wall and\nthrust a flowering branch in through the half-opened window.  Intended for\na more special and a baser use, this room, from which, in the daytime, I\ncould see as far as the keep of Roussainville-le-Pin, was for a long time\nmy place of refuge, doubtless because it was the only room whose door Ï\nwas allowed to lock, whenever my occupation was such as required an\ninviolable solitude; reading or dreaming, secret tears or paroxysms of\ndesire. Alas! I little knew that my own lack of will-power, my delicate\nhealth, and the consequent uncertainty as to my future weighed far more\nheavily on my grandmother’s mind than any little breach of the rules by\nher husband, during those endless perambulations, afternoon and evening,\nin which we used to see passing up and down, obliquely raised towards the\nheavens, her handsome face with its brown and wrinkled cheeks, which with\nage had acquired almost the purple hue of tilled fields in autumn,\ncovered, if she were walking abroad, by a half-lifted veil, while upon\nthem either the cold or some sad reflection invariably left the drying\ntraces of an involuntary tear.",
        "My sole consolation when I went upstairs for the night was that Mamma\nwould come in and kiss me after I was in bed. But this good night lasted\nfor so short a time: she went down again so soon that the moment in which\nI heard her climb the stairs, and then caught the sound of her garden\ndress of blue muslin, from which hung little tassels of plaited straw,\nrustling along the double-doored corridor, was for me a moment of the\nkeenest sorrow. So much did I love that good night that I reached the\nstage of hoping that it would come as late as possible, so as to prolong\nthe time of respite during which Mamma would not yet have appeared.\nSometimes when, after kissing me, she opened the door to go, I longed to\ncall her back, to say to her “Kiss me just once again,” but I knew that\nthen she would at once look displeased, for the concession which she made\nto my wretchedness and agitation in coming up to me with this kiss of\npeace always annoyed my father, who thought such ceremonies absurd, and\nshe would have liked to try to induce me to outgrow the need, the custom\nof having her there at all, which was a very different thing from letting\nthe custom grow up of my asking her for an additional kiss when she was\nalready crossing the threshold. And to see her look displeased destroyed\nall the sense of tranquillity she had brought me a moment before, when she\nbent her loving face down over my bed, and held it out to me like a Host,\nfor an act of Communion in which my lips might drink deeply the sense of\nher real presence, and with it the power to sleep. But those evenings on\nwhich Mamma stayed so short a time in my room were sweet indeed compared\nto those on which we had guests to dinner, and therefore she did not come\nat all. Our ’guests’ were practically limited to M. Swann, who, apart from\na few passing strangers, was almost the only person who ever came to the\nhouse at Combray, sometimes to a neighbourly dinner (but less frequently\nsince his unfortunate marriage, as my family did not care to receive his\nwife) and sometimes after dinner, uninvited. On those evenings when, as we\nsat in front of the house beneath the big chestnut-tree and round the iron\ntable, we heard, from the far end of the garden, not the large and noisy\nrattle which heralded and deafened as he approached with its ferruginous,\ninterminable, frozen sound any member of the household who had put it out\nof action by coming in ’without ringing,’ but the double peal–timid,\noval, gilded–of the visitors’ bell, everyone would at once exclaim “A\nvisitor! Who in the world can it be?” but they knew quite well that it\ncould only be M. Swann. My great-aunt, speaking in a loud voice, to set an\nexample, in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound natural, would tell\nthe others not to whisper so; that nothing could be more unpleasant for a\nstranger coming in, who would be led to think that people were saying\nthings about him which he was not meant to hear; and then my grandmother\nwould be sent out as a scout, always happy to find an excuse for an\nadditional turn in the garden, which she would utilise to remove\nsurreptitiously, as she passed, the stakes of a rose-tree or two, so as to\nmake the roses look a little more natural, as a mother might run her hand\nthrough her boy’s hair, after the barber had smoothed it down, to make it\nstick out properly round his head.",
        "And there we would all stay, hanging on the words which would fall from my\ngrandmother’s lips when she brought us back her report of the enemy, as\nthough there had been some uncertainty among a vast number of possible\ninvaders, and then, soon after, my grandfather would say: “I can hear\nSwann’s voice.” And, indeed, one could tell him only by his voice, for it\nwas difficult to make out his face with its arched nose and green eyes,\nunder a high forehead fringed with fair, almost red hair, dressed in the\nBressant style, because in the garden we used as little light as possible,\nso as not to attract mosquitoes: and I would slip away as though not going\nfor anything in particular, to tell them to bring out the syrups; for my\ngrandmother made a great point, thinking it ’nicer/ of their not being\nallowed to seem anything out of the ordinary, which we kept for visitors\nonly. Although a far younger man, M. Swann was very much attached to my\ngrandfather, who had been an intimate friend, in his time, of Swann’s\nfather, an excellent but an eccentric man in whom the least little thing\nwould, it seemed, often check the flow of his spirits and divert the\ncurrent of his thoughts. Several times in the course of a year I would\nhear my grandfather tell at table the story, which never varied, of the\nbehaviour of M. Swann the elder upon the death of his wife, by whose\nbedside he had watched day and night. My grandfather, who had not seen him\nfor a long time, hastened to join him at the Swanns’ family property on\nthe outskirts of Combray, and managed to entice him for a moment, weeping\nprofusely, out of the death-chamber, so that he should not be present when\nthe body was laid in its coffin. They took a turn or two in the park,\nwhere there was a little sunshine. Suddenly M. Swann seized my grandfather\nby the arm and cried, “Oh, my dear old friend, how fortunate we are to be\nwalking here together on such a charming day! Don’t you see how pretty\nthey are, all these trees–my hawthorns, and my new pond, on which you\nhave never congratulated me? You look as glum as a night-cap. Don’t you\nfeel this little breeze? Ah! whatever you may say, it’s good to be alive\nall the same, my dear Amédée!” And then, abruptly, the memory of his dead\nwife returned to him, and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire\ninto how, at such a time, he could have allowed himself to be carried away\nby an impulse of happiness, he confined himself to a gesture which he\nhabitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his mind:\nthat is, he passed his hand across his forehead, dried his eyes, and wiped\nhis glasses. And he could never be consoled for the loss of his wife, but\nused to say to my grandfather, during the two years for which he survived\nher, “It’s a funny thing, now; I very often think of my poor wife, but I\ncannot think of her very much at any one time.” “Often, but a little at a\ntime, like poor old Swann,” became one of my grandfather’s favourite\nphrases, which he would apply to all kinds of things. And I should have\nassumed that this father of Swann’s had been a monster if my grandfather,\nwhom I regarded as a better judge than myself, and whose word was my law\nand often led me in the long run to pardon offences which I should have\nbeen inclined to condemn, had not gone on to exclaim, “But, after all, he\nhad a heart of gold.”",
        "For many years, albeit–and especially before his marriage–M. Swann the\nyounger came often to see them at Combray, my great-aunt and grandparents\nnever suspected that he had entirely ceased to live in the kind of society\nwhich his family had frequented, or that, under the sort of incognito\nwhich the name of Swann gave him among us, they were harbouring–with the\ncomplete innocence of a family of honest innkeepers who have in their\nmidst some distinguished highwayman and never know it–one of the smartest\nmembers of the Jockey Club, a particular friend of the Comte de Paris and\nof the Prince of Wales, and one of the men most sought after in the\naristocratic world of the Faubourg Saint-Germain.",
        "Our utter ignorance of the brilliant part which Swann was playing in the\nworld of fashion was, of course, due in part to his own reserve and\ndiscretion, but also to the fact that middle-class people in those days\ntook what was almost a Hindu view of society, which they held to consist\nof sharply defined castes, so that everyone at his birth found himself\ncalled to that station in life which his parents already occupied, and\nnothing, except the chance of a brilliant career or of a ’good’ marriage,\ncould extract you from that station or admit you to a superior caste. M.\nSwann, the father, had been a stockbroker; and so ’young Swann’ found\nhimself immured for life in a caste where one’s fortune, as in a list of\ntaxpayers, varied between such and such limits of income. We knew the\npeople with whom his father had associated, and so we knew his own\nassociates, the people with whom he was ’in a position to mix.’ If he knew\nother people besides, those were youthful acquaintances on whom the old\nfriends of the family, like my relatives, shut their eyes all the more\ngood-naturedly that Swann himself, after he was left an orphan, still came\nmost faithfully to see us; but we would have been ready to wager that the\npeople outside our acquaintance whom Swann knew were of the sort to whom\nhe would not have dared to raise his hat, had he met them while he was\nwalking with ourselves. Had there been such a thing as a determination to\napply to Swann a social coefficient peculiar to himself, as distinct from\nall the other sons of other stockbrokers in his father’s position, his\ncoefficient would have been rather lower than theirs, because, leading a\nvery simple life, and having always had a craze for ’antiques’ and\npictures, he now lived and piled up his collections in an old house which\nmy grandmother longed to visit, but which stood on the Quai d’Orléans, a\nneighbourhood in which my great-aunt thought it most degrading to be\nquartered. “Are you really a connoisseur, now?” she would say to him; “I\nask for your own sake, as you are likely to have ’fakes’ palmed off on you\nby the dealers,” for she did not, in fact, endow him with any critical\nfaculty, and had no great opinion of the intelligence of a man who, in\nconversation, would avoid serious topics and shewed a very dull\npreciseness, not only when he gave us kitchen recipes, going into the most\nminute details, but even when my grandmother’s sisters were talking to him\nabout art. When challenged by them to give an opinion, or to express his\nadmiration for some picture, he would remain almost impolitely silent, and\nwould then make amends by furnishing (if he could) some fact or other\nabout the gallery in which the picture was hung, or the date at which it\nhad been painted. But as a rule he would content himself with trying to\namuse us by telling us the story of his latest adventure–and he would\nhave a fresh story for us on every occasion–with some one whom we\nourselves knew, such as the Combray chemist, or our cook, or our coachman.\nThese stories certainly used to make my great-aunt laugh, but she could\nnever tell whether that was on account of the absurd parts which Swann\ninvariably made himself play in the adventures, or of the wit that he\nshewed in telling us of them. “It is easy to see that you are a regular\n’character,’ M. Swann!”",
        "As she was the only member of our family who could be described as a\ntrifle ’common,’ she would always take care to remark to strangers, when\nSwann was mentioned, that he could easily, if he had wished to, have lived\nin the Boulevard Haussmann or the Avenue de l’Opéra, and that he was the\nson of old M. Swann who must have left four or five million francs, but\nthat it was a fad of his. A fad which, moreover, she thought was bound to\namuse other people so much that in Paris, when M. Swann called on New\nYear’s Day bringing her a little packet of marrons glacés, she never\nfailed, if there were strangers in the room, to say to him: “Well, M.\nSwann, and do you still live next door to the Bonded Vaults, so as to be\nsure of not missing your train when you go to Lyons?” and she would peep\nout of the corner of her eye, over her glasses, at the other visitors.",
        "But if anyone had suggested to my aunt that this Swann, who, in his\ncapacity as the son of old M. Swann, was ’fully qualified’ to be received\nby any of the ’upper middle class,’ the most respected barristers and\nsolicitors of Paris (though he was perhaps a trifle inclined to let this\nhereditary privilege go into abeyance), had another almost secret\nexistence of a wholly different kind: that when he left our house in\nParis, saying that he must go home to bed, he would no sooner have turned\nthe corner than he would stop, retrace his steps, and be off to some\ndrawing-room on whose like no stockbroker or associate of stockbrokers had\never set eyes–that would have seemed to my aunt as extraordinary as, to a\nwoman of wider reading, the thought of being herself on terms of intimacy\nwith Aristaeus, of knowing that he would, when he had finished his\nconversation with her, plunge deep into the realms of Thetis, into an\nempire veiled from mortal eyes, in which Virgil depicts him as being\nreceived with open arms; or–to be content with an image more likely to\nhave occurred to her, for she had seen it painted on the plates we used\nfor biscuits at Combray–as the thought of having had to dinner Ali Baba,\nwho, as soon as he found himself alone and unobserved, would make his way\ninto the cave, resplendent with its unsuspected treasures.",
        "One day when he had come to see us after dinner in Paris, and had begged\npardon for being in evening clothes, Françoise, when he had gone, told us\nthat she had got it from his coachman that he had been dining “with a\nprincess.” “A pretty sort of princess,” drawled my aunt; “I know them,\"\nand she shrugged her shoulders without raising her eyes from her knitting,\nserenely ironical.",
        "Altogether, my aunt used to treat him with scant ceremony. Since she was\nof the opinion that he ought to feel flattered by our invitations, she\nthought it only right and proper that he should never come to see us in\nsummer without a basket of peaches or raspberries from his garden, and\nthat from each of his visits to Italy he should bring back some\nphotographs of old masters for me.",
        "It seemed quite natural, therefore, to send to him whenever we wanted a\nrecipe for some special sauce or for a pineapple salad for one of our big\ndinner-parties, to which he himself would not be invited, not seeming of\nsufficient importance to be served up to new friends who might be in our\nhouse for the first time. If the conversation turned upon the Princes of\nthe House of France, “Gentlemen, you and I will never know, will we, and\ndon’t want to, do we?” my great-aunt would say tartly to Swann, who had,\nperhaps, a letter from Twickenham in his pocket; she would make him play\naccompaniments and turn over music on evenings when my grandmother’s\nsister sang; manipulating this creature, so rare and refined at other\ntimes and in other places, with the rough simplicity of a child who will\nplay with some curio from the cabinet no more carefully than if it were a\npenny toy.  Certainly the Swann who was a familiar figure in all the clubs\nof those days differed hugely from, the Swann created in my great-aunt’s\nmind when, of an evening, in our little garden at Combray, after the two\nshy peals had sounded from the gate, she would vitalise, by injecting into\nit everything she had ever heard about the Swann family, the vague and\nunrecognisable shape which began to appear, with my grandmother in its\nwake, against a background of shadows, and could at last be identified by\nthe sound of its voice. But then, even in the most insignificant details\nof our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole,\nwhich is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in\nan account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is created\nby the thoughts of other people. Even the simple act which we describe as\n\"seeing some one we know” is, to some extent, an intellectual process. We\npack the physical outline of the creature we see with all the ideas we\nhave already formed about him, and in the complete picture of him which we\ncompose in our minds those ideas have certainly the principal place. In\nthe end they come to fill out so completely the curve of his cheeks, to\nfollow so exactly the line of his nose, they blend so harmoniously in the\nsound of his voice that these seem to be no more than a transparent\nenvelope, so that each time we see the face or hear the voice it is our\nown ideas of him which we recognise and to which we listen. And so, no\ndoubt, from the Swann they had built up for their own purposes my family\nhad left out, in their ignorance, a whole crowd of the details of his\ndaily life in the world of fashion, details by means of which other\npeople, when they met him, saw all the Graces enthroned in his face and\nstopping at the line of his arched nose as at a natural frontier; but they\ncontrived also to put into a face from which its distinction had been\nevicted, a face vacant and roomy as an untenanted house, to plant in the\ndepths of its unvalued eyes a lingering sense, uncertain but not\nunpleasing, half-memory and half-oblivion, of idle hours spent together\nafter our weekly dinners, round the card-table or in the garden, during\nour companionable country life. Our friend’s bodily frame had been so well\nlined with this sense, and with various earlier memories of his family,\nthat their own special Swann had become to my people a complete and living\ncreature; so that even now I have the feeling of leaving some one I know\nfor another quite different person when, going back in memory, I pass from\nthe Swann whom I knew later and more intimately to this early Swann–this\nearly Swann in whom I can distinguish the charming mistakes of my\nchildhood, and who, incidentally, is less like his successor than he is\nlike the other people I knew at that time, as though one’s life were a\nseries of galleries in which all the portraits of any one period had a\nmarked family likeness, the same (so to speak) tonality–this early Swann\nabounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree,\nof baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of tarragon.",
        "And yet one day, when my grandmother had gone to ask some favour of a lady\nwhom she had known at the Sacré Coeur (and with whom, because of our caste\ntheory, she had not cared to keep up any degree of intimacy in spite of\nseveral common interests), the Marquise de Villeparisis, of the famous\nhouse of Bouillon, this lady had said to her:",
        "“I think you know M. Swann very well; he is a great friend of my nephews,\nthe des Laumes.”",
        "My grandmother had returned from the call full of praise for the house,\nwhich overlooked some gardens, and in which Mme. de Villeparisis had\nadvised her to rent a flat; and also for a repairing tailor and his\ndaughter, who kept a little shop in the courtyard, into which she had gone\nto ask them to put a stitch in her skirt, which she had torn on the\nstaircase. My grandmother had found these people perfectly charming: the\ngirl, she said, was a jewel, and the tailor a most distinguished man, the\nfinest she had ever seen. For in her eyes distinction was a thing wholly\nindependent of social position. She was in ecstasies over some answer the\ntailor had made, saying to Mamma:",
        "“Sévigné would not have said it better!” and, by way of contrast, of a\nnephew of Mme. de Villeparisis whom she had met at the house:",
        "“My dear, he is so common!”",
        "Now, the effect of that remark about Swann had been, not to raise him in\nmy great-aunt’s estimation, but to lower Mme. de Villeparisis. It appeared\nthat the deference which, on my grandmother’s authority, we owed to Mme.\nde Villeparisis imposed on her the reciprocal obligation to do nothing\nthat would render her less worthy of our regard, and that she had failed\nin her duty in becoming aware of Swann’s existence and in allowing members\nof her family to associate with him. “How should she know Swann? A lady\nwho, you always made out, was related to Marshal MacMahon!” This view of\nSwann’s social atmosphere which prevailed in my family seemed to be\nconfirmed later on by his marriage with a woman of the worst class, you\nmight almost say a ’fast’ woman, whom, to do him justice, he never\nattempted to introduce to us, for he continued to come to us alone, though\nhe came more and more seldom; but from whom they thought they could\nestablish, on the assumption that he had found her there, the circle,\nunknown to them, in which he ordinarily moved.",
        "But on one occasion my grandfather read in a newspaper that M. Swann was\none of the most faithful attendants at the Sunday luncheons given by the\nDuc de X––, whose father and uncle had been among our most prominent\nstatesmen in the reign of Louis Philippe. Now my grandfather was curious\nto learn all the little details which might help him to take a mental\nshare in the private lives of men like Mole, the Due Pasquier, or the Duc\nde Broglie. He was delighted to find that Swann associated with people who\nhad known them. My great-aunt, however, interpreted this piece of news in\na sense discreditable to Swann; for anyone who chose his associates\noutside the caste in which he had been born and bred, outside his ’proper\nstation,’ was condemned to utter degradation in her eyes. It seemed to her\nthat such a one abdicated all claim to enjoy the fruits of those friendly\nrelations with people of good position which prudent parents cultivate and\nstore up for their children’s benefit, for my great-aunt had actually\nceased to ’see’ the son of a lawyer we had known because he had married a\n’Highness’ and had thereby stepped down–in her eyes–from the respectable\nposition of a lawyer’s son to that of those adventurers, upstart footmen\nor stable-boys mostly, to whom we read that queens have sometimes shewn\ntheir favours. She objected, therefore, to my grandfather’s plan of\nquestioning Swann, when next he came to dine with us, about these people\nwhose friendship with him we had discovered. On the other hand, my\ngrandmother’s two sisters, elderly spinsters who shared her nobility of\ncharacter but lacked her intelligence, declared that they could not\nconceive what pleasure their brother-in-law could find in talking about\nsuch trifles. They were ladies of lofty ambition, who for that reason were\nincapable of taking the least interest in what might be called the\n’pinchbeck’ things of life, even when they had an historic value, or,\ngenerally speaking, in anything that was not directly associated with some\nobject aesthetically precious. So complete was their negation of interest\nin anything which seemed directly or indirectly a part of our everyday\nlife that their sense of hearing–which had gradually come to understand\nits own futility when the tone of the conversation, at the dinner-table,\nbecame frivolous or merely mundane, without the two old ladies’ being able\nto guide it back to the topic dear to themselves–would leave its\nreceptive channels unemployed, so effectively that they were actually\nbecoming atrophied. So that if my grandfather wished to attract the\nattention of the two sisters, he would have to make use of some such alarm\nsignals as mad-doctors adopt in dealing with their distracted patients; as\nby beating several times on a glass with the blade of a knife, fixing them\nat the same time with a sharp word and a compelling glance, violent\nmethods which the said doctors are apt to bring with them into their\neveryday life among the sane, either from force of professional habit or\nbecause they think the whole world a trifle mad.",
        "Their interest grew, however, when, the day before Swann was to dine with\nus, and when he had made them a special present of a case of Asti, my\ngreat-aunt, who had in her hand a copy of the Figaro in which to the\nname of a picture then on view in a Corot exhibition were added the words,\n\"from the collection of M. Charles Swann,” asked: “Did you see that Swann\nis ’mentioned’ in the Figaro?”",
        "“But I have always told you,” said my grandmother, “that he had plenty of\ntaste.”",
        "“You would, of course,” retorted my great-aunt, “say anything just to seem\ndifferent from us.” For, knowing that my grandmother never agreed with\nher, and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion which the\nrest of us invariably endorsed, she wished to extort from us a wholesale\ncondemnation of my grandmother’s views, against which she hoped to force\nus into solidarity with her own.",
        "But we sat silent. My grandmother’s sisters having expressed a desire to\nmention to Swann this reference to him in the Figaro, my great-aunt\ndissuaded them. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however trivial,\nwhich she herself lacked, she would persuade herself that it was no\nadvantage at all, but a drawback, and would pity so as not to have to envy\nthem.",
        "“I don’t think that would please him at all; I know very well, I should\nhate to see my name printed like that, as large as life, in the paper, and\nI shouldn’t feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it.”",
        "She did not, however, put any very great pressure upon my grandmother’s\nsisters, for they, in their horror of vulgarity, had brought to such a\nfine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious\ncircumlocution, that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person to\nwhom it was addressed. As for my mother, her only thought was of managing\nto induce my father to consent to speak to Swann, not of his wife, but of\nhis daughter, whom he worshipped, and for whose sake it was understood\nthat he had ultimately made his unfortunate marriage.",
        "“You need only say a word; just ask him how she is. It must be so very\nhard for him.”",
        "My father, however, was annoyed: “No, no; you have the most absurd ideas.\nIt would be utterly ridiculous.”",
        "But the only one of us in whom the prospect of Swann’s arrival gave rise\nto an unhappy foreboding was myself. And that was because on the evenings\nwhen there were visitors, or just M. Swann in the house, Mamma did not\ncome up to my room. I did not, at that time, have dinner with the family:\nI came out to the garden after dinner, and at nine I said good night and\nwent to bed. But on these evenings I used to dine earlier than the others,\nand to come in afterwards and sit at table until eight o’clock, when it\nwas understood that I must go upstairs; that frail and precious kiss which\nMamma used always to leave upon my lips when I was in bed and just going\nto sleep I had to take with me from the dining-room to my own, and to keep\ninviolate all the time that it took me to undress, without letting its\nsweet charm be broken, without letting its volatile essence diffuse itself\nand evaporate; and just on those very evenings when I must needs take most\npains to receive it with due formality, I had to snatch it, to seize it\ninstantly and in public, without even having the time or being properly\nfree to apply to what I was doing the punctiliousness which madmen use who\ncompel themselves to exclude all other thoughts from their minds while\nthey are shutting a door, so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps\nover them again they can triumphantly face and overcome it with the\nrecollection of the precise moment in which the door was shut.",
        "We were all in the garden when the double peal of the gate-bell sounded\nshyly. Everyone knew that it must be Swann, and yet they looked at one\nanother inquiringly and sent my grandmother scouting.",
        "“See that you thank him intelligibly for the wine,” my grandfather warned\nhis two sisters-in-law; “you know how good it is, and it is a huge case.”",
        "“Now, don’t start whispering!” said my great-aunt. “How would you like to\ncome into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?”",
        "“Ah! There’s M. Swann,” cried my father. “Let’s ask him if he thinks it\nwill be fine to-morrow.”",
        "My mother fancied that a word from her would wipe out all the\nunpleasantness which my family had contrived to make Swann feel since his\nmarriage.  She found an opportunity to draw him aside for a moment. But I\nfollowed her: I could not bring myself to let her go out of reach of me\nwhile I felt that in a few minutes I should have to leave her in the\ndining-room and go up to my bed without the consoling thought, as on\nordinary evenings, that she would come up, later, to kiss me.",
        "“Now, M. Swann,” she said, “do tell me about your daughter; I am sure she\nshews a taste already for nice things, like her papa.”",
        "“Come along and sit down here with us all on the verandah,” said my\ngrandfather, coming up to him. My mother had to abandon the quest, but\nmanaged to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of\nthought, as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into the\ndiscovery of their finest lines.",
        "“We can talk about her again when we are by ourselves,” she said, or\nrather whispered to Swann. “It is only a mother who can understand. I am\nsure that hers would agree with me.”",
        "And so we all sat down round the iron table. I should have liked not to\nthink of the hours of anguish which I should have to spend, that\nevening, alone in my room, without the possibility of going to sleep: I\ntried to convince myself that they were of no importance, really, since\nI should have forgotten them next morning, and to fix my mind on\nthoughts of the future which would carry me, as on a bridge, across the\nterrifying abyss that yawned at my feet. But my mind, strained by this\nforeboding, distended like the look which I shot at my mother, would not\nallow any other impression to enter. Thoughts did, indeed, enter it, but\nonly on the condition that they left behind them every element of\nbeauty, or even of quaintness, by which I might have been distracted or\nbeguiled. As a surgical patient, by means of a local anaesthetic, can\nlook on with a clear consciousness while an operation is being performed\nupon him and yet feel nothing, I could repeat to myself some favourite\nlines, or watch my grandfather attempting to talk to Swann about the Duc\nd’Audriffet-Pasquier, without being able to kindle any emotion from one\nor amusement from the other. Hardly had my grandfather begun to question\nSwann about that orator when one of my grandmother’s sisters, in whose\nears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her\nnatural politeness bade her interrupt, addressed the other with:",
        "“Just fancy, Flora, I met a young Swedish governess to-day who told me\nsome most interesting things about the co-operative movement in\nScandinavia.  We really must have her to dine here one evening.”",
        "“To be sure!” said her sister Flora, “but I haven’t wasted my time either.\nI met such a clever old gentleman at M. Vinteuil’s who knows Maubant quite\nwell, and Maubant has told him every little thing about how he gets up his\nparts. It is the most interesting thing I ever heard. He is a neighbour of\nM. Vinteuil’s, and I never knew; and he is so nice besides.”",
        "“M. Vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours,” cried my aunt\nCéline in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid, and seemed\nforced because she had been planning the little speech for so long;\ndarting, as she spoke, what she called a ’significant glance’ at Swann.\nAnd my aunt Flora, who realised that this veiled utterance was Céline’s\nway of thanking Swann intelligibly for the Asti, looked at him with a\nblend of congratulation and irony, either just, because she wished to\nunderline her sister’s little epigram, or because she envied Swann his\nhaving inspired it, or merely because she imagined that he was\nembarrassed, and could not help having a little fun at his expense.",
        "“I think it would be worth while,” Flora went on, “to have this old\ngentleman to dinner. When you get him upon Maubant or Mme. Materna he will\ntalk for hours on end.”",
        "“That must be delightful,” sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature had\nunfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for becoming\npassionately interested in the co-operative movement among the ladies of\nSweden or in the methods employed by Maubant to get up his parts, just as\nit had forgotten to endow my grandmother’s two sisters with a grain of\nthat precious salt which one has oneself to ’add to taste’ in order to\nextract any savour from a narrative of the private life of Mole or of the\nComte de Paris.",
        "“I say!” exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, “what I was going to tell you\nhas more to do than you might think with what you were asking me just now,\nfor in some respects there has been very little change. I came across a\npassage in Saint-Simon this morning which would have amused you. It is in\nthe volume which covers his mission to Spain; not one of the best, little\nmore in fact than a journal, but at least it is a journal wonderfully well\nwritten, which fairly distinguishes it from the devastating journalism\nthat we feel bound to read in these days, morning, noon and night.”",
        "“I do not agree with you: there are some days when I find reading the\npapers very pleasant indeed!” my aunt Flora broke in, to show Swann that\nshe had read the note about his Corot in the Figaro.",
        "“Yes,” aunt Céline went one better. “When they write about things or\npeople in whom we are interested.”",
        "“I don’t deny it,” answered Swann in some bewilderment. “The fault I\nfind with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in some\nfresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three or four books in a\nlifetime give us anything that is of real importance. Suppose that, every\nmorning, when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered hands, a\ntransmutation were to take place, and we were to find inside it–oh! I\ndon’t know; shall we say Pascal’s Pensées?” He articulated the title with\nan ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic. “And then, in the gilt and\ntooled volumes which we open once in ten years,” he went on, shewing that\ncontempt for the things of this world which some men of the world like to\naffect, “we should read that the Queen of the Hellenes had arrived at\nCannes, or that the Princesse de Léon had given a fancy dress ball. In\nthat way we should arrive at the right proportion between ’information’\nand ’publicity.’” But at once regretting that he had allowed himself to\nspeak, even in jest, of serious matters, he added ironically: “We are\nhaving a most entertaining conversation; I cannot think why we climb to\nthese lofty summits,” and then, turning to my grandfather: “Well,\nSaint-Simon tells how Maulevrier had had the audacity to offer his hand to\nhis sons. You remember how he says of Maulevrier, ’Never did I find in\nthat coarse bottle anything but ill-humour, boorishness, and folly.’”",
        "“Coarse or not, I know bottles in which there is something very\ndifferent!” said Flora briskly, feeling bound to thank Swann as well as\nher sister, since the present of Asti had been addressed to them both.\nCéline began to laugh.",
        "Swann was puzzled, but went on: “’I cannot say whether it was his\nignorance or a trap,’ writes Saint-Simon; ’he wished to give his hand to\nmy children. I noticed it in time to prevent him.’”",
        "My grandfather was already in ecstasies over “ignorance or a trap,” but\nMiss Céline–the name of Saint-Simon, a ’man of letters,’ having arrested\nthe complete paralysis of her sense of hearing–had grown angry.",
        "“What! You admire that, do you? Well, it is clever enough! But what is the\npoint of it? Does he mean that one man isn’t as good as another? What\ndifference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long as he is\nintelligent and good? He had a fine way of bringing up his children, your\nSaint-Simon, if he didn’t teach them to shake hands with all honest men.\nReally and truly, it’s abominable. And you dare to quote it!”",
        "And my grandfather, utterly depressed, realising how futile it would be\nfor him, against this opposition, to attempt to get Swann to tell him the\nstories which would have amused him, murmured to my mother: “Just tell me\nagain that line of yours which always comforts me so much on these\noccasions. Oh, yes:",
        "  What virtues, Lord, Thou makest us abhor!",
        "Good, that is, very good.”",
        "I never took my eyes off my mother. I knew that when they were at table I\nshould not be permitted to stay there for the whole of dinner-time, and\nthat Mamma, for fear of annoying my father, would not allow me to give her\nin public the series of kisses that she would have had in my room.  And so\nI promised myself that in the dining-room, as they began to eat and drink\nand as I felt the hour approach, I would put beforehand into this kiss,\nwhich was bound to be so brief and stealthy in execution, everything that\nmy own efforts could put into it: would look out very carefully first the\nexact spot on her cheek where I would imprint it, and would so prepare my\nthoughts that I might be able, thanks to these mental preliminaries, to\nconsecrate the whole of the minute Mamma would allow me to the sensation\nof her cheek against my lips, as a painter who can have his subject for\nshort sittings only prepares his palette, and from what he remembers and\nfrom rough notes does in advance everything which he possibly can do in\nthe sitter’s absence. But to-night, before the dinner-bell had sounded, my\ngrandfather said with unconscious cruelty: “The little man looks tired;\nhe’d better go up to bed. Besides, we are dining late to-night.”",
        "And my father, who was less scrupulous than my grandmother or mother in\nobserving the letter of a treaty, went on: “Yes, run along; to bed with\nyou.”",
        "I would have kissed Mamma then and there, but at that moment the\ndinner-bell rang.",
        "“No, no, leave your mother alone. You’ve said good night quite enough.\nThese exhibitions are absurd. Go on upstairs.”",
        "And so I must set forth without viaticum; must climb each step of the\nstaircase ’against my heart,’ as the saying is, climbing in opposition to\nmy heart’s desire, which was to return to my mother, since she had not, by\nher kiss, given my heart leave to accompany me forth. That hateful\nstaircase, up which I always passed with such dismay, gave out a smell of\nvarnish which had to some extent absorbed, made definite and fixed the\nspecial quality of sorrow that I felt each evening, and made it perhaps\neven more cruel to my sensibility because, when it assumed this olfactory\nguise, my intellect was powerless to resist it. When we have gone to sleep\nwith a maddening toothache and are conscious of it only as a little girl\nwhom we attempt, time after time, to pull out of the water, or as a line\nof Molière which we repeat incessantly to ourselves, it is a great relief\nto wake up, so that our intelligence can disentangle the idea of toothache\nfrom any artificial semblance of heroism or rhythmic cadence. It was the\nprecise converse of this relief which I felt when my anguish at having to\ngo up to my room invaded my consciousness in a manner infinitely more\nrapid, instantaneous almost, a manner at once insidious and brutal as I\nbreathed in–a far more poisonous thing than any moral penetration–the\npeculiar smell of the varnish upon that staircase.",
        "Once in my room I had to stop every loophole, to close the shutters, to\ndig my own grave as I turned down the bed-clothes, to wrap myself in the\nshroud of my nightshirt. But before burying myself in the iron bed which\nhad been placed there because, on summer nights, I was too hot among the\nrep curtains of the four-poster, I was stirred to revolt, and attempted\nthe desperate stratagem of a condemned prisoner. I wrote to my mother\nbegging her to come upstairs for an important reason which I could not put\nin writing. My fear was that Françoise, my aunt’s cook who used to be put\nin charge of me when I was at Combray, might refuse to take my note. I had\na suspicion that, in her eyes, to carry a message to my mother when there\nwas a stranger in the room would appear flatly inconceivable, just as it\nwould be for the door-keeper of a theatre to hand a letter to an actor\nupon the stage. For things which might or might not be done she possessed\na code at once imperious, abundant, subtle, and uncompromising on points\nthemselves imperceptible or irrelevant, which gave it a resemblance to\nthose ancient laws which combine such cruel ordinances as the massacre of\ninfants at the breast with prohibitions, of exaggerated refinement,\nagainst “seething the kid in his mother’s milk,” or “eating of the sinew\nwhich is upon the hollow of the thigh.” This code, if one could judge it\nby the sudden obstinacy which she would put into her refusal to carry out\ncertain of our instructions, seemed to have foreseen such social\ncomplications and refinements of fashion as nothing in Françoise’s\nsurroundings or in her career as a servant in a village household could\nhave put into her head; and we were obliged to assume that there was\nlatent in her some past existence in the ancient history of France, noble\nand little understood, just as there is in those manufacturing towns where\nold mansions still testify to their former courtly days, and chemical\nworkers toil among delicately sculptured scenes of the Miracle of\nTheophilus or the Quatre Fils Aymon.",
        "In this particular instance, the article of her code which made it highly\nimprobable that–barring an outbreak of fire–Françoise would go down and\ndisturb Mamma when M. Swann was there for so unimportant a person as\nmyself was one embodying the respect she shewed not only for the family\n(as for the dead, for the clergy, or for royalty), but also for the\nstranger within our gates; a respect which I should perhaps have found\ntouching in a book, but which never failed to irritate me on her lips,\nbecause of the solemn and gentle tones in which she would utter it, and\nwhich irritated me more than usual this evening when the sacred character\nin which she invested the dinner-party might have the effect of making her\ndecline to disturb its ceremonial. But to give myself one chance of\nsuccess I lied without hesitation, telling her that it was not in the\nleast myself who had wanted to write to Mamma, but Mamma who, on saying\ngood night to me, had begged me not to forget to send her an answer about\nsomething she had asked me to find, and that she would certainly be very\nangry if this note were not taken to her. I think that Françoise\ndisbelieved me, for, like those primitive men whose senses were so much\nkeener than our own, she could immediately detect, by signs imperceptible\nby the rest of us, the truth or falsehood of anything that we might wish\nto conceal from her. She studied the envelope for five minutes as though\nan examination of the paper itself and the look of my handwriting could\nenlighten her as to the nature of the contents, or tell her to which\narticle of her code she ought to refer the matter. Then she went out with\nan air of resignation which seemed to imply: “What a dreadful thing for\nparents to have a child like this!”",
        "A moment later she returned to say that they were still at the ice stage\nand that it was impossible for the butler to deliver the note at once, in\nfront of everybody; but that when the finger-bowls were put round he would\nfind a way of slipping it into Mamma’s hand. At once my anxiety subsided;\nit was now no longer (as it had been a moment ago) until to-morrow that I\nhad lost my mother, for my little line was going–to annoy her, no doubt,\nand doubly so because this contrivance would make me ridiculous in Swann’s\neyes–but was going all the same to admit me, invisibly and by stealth,\ninto the same room as herself, was going to whisper from me into her ear;\nfor that forbidden and unfriendly dining-room, where but a moment ago the\nice itself–with burned nuts in it–and the finger-bowls seemed to me to\nbe concealing pleasures that were mischievous and of a mortal sadness\nbecause Mamma was tasting of them and I was far away, had opened its doors\nto me and, like a ripe fruit which bursts through its skin, was going to\npour out into my intoxicated heart the gushing sweetness of Mamma’s\nattention while she was reading what I had written. Now I was no longer\nseparated from her; the barriers were down; an exquisite thread was\nbinding us. Besides, that was not all, for surely Mamma would come.",
        "As for the agony through which I had just passed, I imagined that Swann\nwould have laughed heartily at it if he had read my letter and had guessed\nits purpose; whereas, on the contrary, as I was to learn in due course, a\nsimilar anguish had been the bane of his life for many years, and no one\nperhaps could have understood my feelings at that moment so well as\nhimself; to him, that anguish which lies in knowing that the creature one\nadores is in some place of enjoyment where oneself is not and cannot\nfollow–to him that anguish came through Love, to which it is in a sense\npredestined, by which it must be equipped and adapted; but when, as had\nbefallen me, such an anguish possesses one’s soul before Love has yet\nentered into one’s life, then it must drift, awaiting Love’s coming, vague\nand free, without precise attachment, at the disposal of one sentiment\nto-day, of another to-morrow, of filial piety or affection for a comrade.\nAnd the joy with which I first bound myself apprentice, when Françoise\nreturned to tell me that my letter would be delivered; Swann, too, had\nknown well that false joy which a friend can give us, or some relative of\nthe woman we love, when on his arrival at the house or theatre where she\nis to be found, for some ball or party or ’first-night’ at which he is to\nmeet her, he sees us wandering outside, desperately awaiting some\nopportunity of communicating with her. He recognises us, greets us\nfamiliarly, and asks what we are doing there. And when we invent a story\nof having some urgent message to give to his relative or friend, he\nassures us that nothing could be more simple, takes us in at the door, and\npromises to send her down to us in five minutes. How much we love him–as\nat that moment I loved Françoise–the good-natured intermediary who by a\nsingle word has made supportable, human, almost propitious the\ninconceivable, infernal scene of gaiety in the thick of which we had been\nimagining swarms of enemies, perverse and seductive, beguiling away from\nus, even making laugh at us, the woman whom we love. If we are to judge of\nthem by him, this relative who has accosted us and who is himself an\ninitiate in those cruel mysteries, then the other guests cannot be so very\ndemoniacal. Those inaccessible and torturing hours into which she had gone\nto taste of unknown pleasures–behold, a breach in the wall, and we are\nthrough it. Behold, one of the moments whose series will go to make up\ntheir sum, a moment as genuine as the rest, if not actually more important\nto ourself because our mistress is more intensely a part of it; we picture\nit to ourselves, we possess it, we intervene upon it, almost we have\ncreated it: namely, the moment in which he goes to tell her that we are\nwaiting there below. And very probably the other moments of the party will\nnot be essentially different, will contain nothing else so exquisite or so\nwell able to make us suffer, since this kind friend has assured us that\n\"Of course, she will be delighted to come down! It will be far more\namusing for her to talk to you than to be bored up there.” Alas! Swann had\nlearned by experience that the good intentions of a third party are\npowerless to control a woman who is annoyed to find herself pursued even\ninto a ball-room by a man whom she does not love. Too often, the kind\nfriend comes down again alone.",
        "My mother did not appear, but with no attempt to safeguard my self-respect\n(which depended upon her keeping up the fiction that she had asked me to\nlet her know the result of my search for something or other) made\nFrançoise tell me, in so many words “There is no answer\"–words I have so\noften, since then, heard the hall-porters in ’mansions’ and the flunkeys\nin gambling-clubs and the like, repeat to some poor girl, who replies in\nbewilderment: “What! he’s said nothing? It’s not possible. You did give\nhim my letter, didn’t you? Very well, I shall wait a little longer.” And\njust as she invariably protests that she does not need the extra gas which\nthe porter offers to light for her, and sits on there, hearing nothing\nfurther, except an occasional remark on the weather which the porter\nexchanges with a messenger whom he will send off suddenly, when he notices\nthe time, to put some customer’s wine on the ice; so, having declined\nFrançoise’s offer to make me some tea or to stay beside me, I let her go\noff again to the servants’ hall, and lay down and shut my eyes, and tried\nnot to hear the voices of my family who were drinking their coffee in the\ngarden.",
        "But after a few seconds I realised that, by writing that line to Mamma, by\napproaching–at the risk of making her angry–so near to her that I felt I\ncould reach out and grasp the moment in which I should see her again, I\nhad cut myself off from the possibility of going to sleep until I actually\nhad seen her, and my heart began to beat more and more painfully as I\nincreased my agitation by ordering myself to keep calm and to acquiesce in\nmy ill-fortune. Then, suddenly, my anxiety subsided, a feeling of intense\nhappiness coursed through me, as when a strong medicine begins to take\neffect and one’s pain vanishes: I had formed a resolution to abandon all\nattempts to go to sleep without seeing Mamma, and had decided to kiss her\nat all costs, even with the certainty of being in disgrace with her for\nlong afterwards, when she herself came up to bed. The tranquillity which\nfollowed my anguish made me extremely alert, no less than my sense of\nexpectation, my thirst for and my fear of danger.",
        "Noiselessly I opened the window and sat down on the foot of my bed; hardly\ndaring to move in case they should hear me from below. Things outside\nseemed also fixed in mute expectation, so as not to disturb the moonlight\nwhich, duplicating each of them and throwing it back by the extension,\nforwards, of a shadow denser and more concrete than its substance, had\nmade the whole landscape seem at once thinner and longer, like a map\nwhich, after being folded up, is spread out upon the ground.  What had to\nmove–a leaf of the chestnut-tree, for instance–moved. But its minute\nshuddering, complete, finished to the least detail and with utmost\ndelicacy of gesture, made no discord with the rest of the scene, and yet\nwas not merged in it, remaining clearly outlined. Exposed upon this\nsurface of silence, which absorbed nothing from them, the most distant\nsounds, those which must have come from gardens at the far end of the\ntown, could be distinguished with such exact ’finish’ that the impression\nthey gave of coming from a distance seemed due only to their ’pianissimo’\nexecution, like those movements on muted strings so well performed by the\norchestra of the Conservatoire that, although one does not lose a single\nnote, one thinks all the same that they are being played somewhere\noutside, a long way from the concert hall, so that all the old\nsubscribers, and my grandmother’s sisters too, when Swann had given them\nhis seats, used to strain their ears as if they had caught the distant\napproach of an army on the march, which had not yet rounded the corner of\nthe Rue de Trévise.",
        "I was well aware that I had placed myself in a position than which none\ncould be counted upon to involve me in graver consequences at my parents’\nhands; consequences far graver, indeed, than a stranger would have\nimagined, and such as (he would have thought) could follow only some\nreally shameful fault. But in the system of education which they had given\nme faults were not classified in the same order as in that of other\nchildren, and I had been taught to place at the head of the list\n(doubtless because there was no other class of faults from which I needed\nto be more carefully protected) those in which I can now distinguish the\ncommon feature that one succumbs to them by yielding to a nervous impulse.\nBut such words as these last had never been uttered in my hearing; no one\nhad yet accounted for my temptations in a way which might have led me to\nbelieve that there was some excuse for my giving in to them, or that I was\nactually incapable of holding out against them. Yet I could easily\nrecognise this class of transgressions by the anguish of mind which\npreceded, as well as by the rigour of the punishment which followed them;\nand I knew that what I had just done was in the same category as certain\nother sins for which I had been severely chastised, though infinitely more\nserious than they. When I went out to meet my mother as she herself came\nup to bed, and when she saw that I had remained up so as to say good night\nto her again in the passage, I should not be allowed to stay in the house\na day longer, I should be packed off to school next morning; so much was\ncertain.  Very good: had I been obliged, the next moment, to hurl myself\nout of the window, I should still have preferred such a fate. For what I\nwanted now was Mamma, and to say good night to her. I had gone too far\nalong the road which led to the realisation of this desire to be able to\nretrace my steps.",
        "I could hear my parents’ footsteps as they went with Swann; and, when the\nrattle of the gate assured me that he had really gone, I crept to the\nwindow. Mamma was asking my father if he had thought the lobster good, and\nwhether M. Swann had had some of the coffee-and-pistachio ice. “I thought\nit rather so-so,” she was saying; “next time we shall have to try another\nflavour.”",
        "“I can’t tell you,” said my great-aunt, “what a change I find in Swann.\nHe is quite antiquated!” She had grown so accustomed to seeing Swann\nalways in the same stage of adolescence that it was a shock to her to find\nhim suddenly less young than the age she still attributed to him. And the\nothers too were beginning to remark in Swann that abnormal, excessive,\nscandalous senescence, meet only in a celibate, in one of that class for\nwhom it seems that the great day which knows no morrow must be longer than\nfor other men, since for such a one it is void of promise, and from its\ndawn the moments steadily accumulate without any subsequent partition\namong his offspring.",
        "“I fancy he has a lot of trouble with that wretched wife of his, who\n’lives’ with a certain Monsieur de Charlus, as all Combray knows. It’s the\ntalk of the town.”",
        "My mother observed that, in spite of this, he had looked much less unhappy\nof late. “And he doesn’t nearly so often do that trick of his, so like his\nfather, of wiping his eyes and passing his hand across his forehead. I\nthink myself that in his heart of hearts he doesn’t love his wife any\nmore.”",
        "“Why, of course he doesn’t,” answered my grandfather. “He wrote me a\nletter about it, ages ago, to which I took care to pay no attention, but\nit left no doubt as to his feelings, let alone his love for his wife.\nHullo! you two; you never thanked him for the Asti!” he went on, turning\nto his sisters-in-law.",
        "“What! we never thanked him? I think, between you and me, that I put it to\nhim quite neatly,” replied my aunt Flora.",
        "“Yes, you managed it very well; I admired you for it,” said my aunt\nCéline.",
        "“But you did it very prettily, too.”",
        "“Yes; I liked my expression about ’nice neighbours.’”",
        "“What! Do you call that thanking him?” shouted my grandfather. “I heard\nthat all right, but devil take me if I guessed it was meant for Swann.\nYou may be quite sure he never noticed it.”",
        "“Come, come; Swann is not a fool. I am positive he appreciated the\ncompliment.  You didn’t expect me to tell him the number of bottles, or to\nguess what he paid for them.”",
        "My father and mother were left alone and sat down for a moment; then my\nfather said: “Well, shall we go up to bed?”",
        "“As you wish, dear, though I don’t feel in the least like sleeping. I\ndon’t know why; it can’t be the coffee-ice–it wasn’t strong enough to\nkeep me awake like this. But I see a light in the servants’ hall: poor\nFrançoise has been sitting up for me, so I will get her to unhook me while\nyou go and undress.”",
        "My mother opened the latticed door which led from the hall to the\nstaircase.  Presently I heard her coming upstairs to close her window. I\nwent quietly into the passage; my heart was beating so violently that I\ncould hardly move, but at least it was throbbing no longer with anxiety,\nbut with terror and with joy. I saw in the well of the stair a light\ncoming upwards, from Mamma’s candle. Then I saw Mamma herself: I threw\nmyself upon her. For an instant she looked at me in astonishment, not\nrealising what could have happened. Then her face assumed an expression of\nanger. She said not a single word to me; and, for that matter, I used to\ngo for days on end without being spoken to, for far less offences than\nthis. A single word from Mamma would have been an admission that further\nintercourse with me was within the bounds of possibility, and that might\nperhaps have appeared to me more terrible still, as indicating that, with\nsuch a punishment as was in store for me, mere silence, and even anger,\nwere relatively puerile.",
        "A word from her then would have implied the false calm in which one\nconverses with a servant to whom one has just decided to give notice; the\nkiss one bestows on a son who is being packed off to enlist, which would\nhave been denied him if it had merely been a matter of being angry with\nhim for a few days. But she heard my father coming from the dressing-room,\nwhere he had gone to take off his clothes, and, to avoid the ’scene’ which\nhe would make if he saw me, she said, in a voice half-stifled by her\nanger: “Run away at once. Don’t let your father see you standing there\nlike a crazy jane!”",
        "But I begged her again to “Come and say good night to me!” terrified as I\nsaw the light from my father’s candle already creeping up the wall, but\nalso making use of his approach as a means of blackmail, in the hope that\nmy mother, not wishing him to find me there, as find me he must if she\ncontinued to hold out, would give in to me, and say: “Go back to your\nroom. I will come.”",
        "Too late: my father was upon us. Instinctively I murmured, though no one\nheard me, “I am done for!”",
        "I was not, however. My father used constantly to refuse to let me do\nthings which were quite clearly allowed by the more liberal charters\ngranted me by my mother and grandmother, because he paid no heed to\n’Principles,’ and because in his sight there were no such things as\n’Rights of Man.’ For some quite irrelevant reason, or for no reason at\nall, he would at the last moment prevent me from taking some particular\nwalk, one so regular and so consecrated to my use that to deprive me of it\nwas a clear breach of faith; or again, as he had done this evening, long\nbefore the appointed hour he would snap out: “Run along up to bed now; no\nexcuses!” But then again, simply because he was devoid of principles (in\nmy grandmother’s sense), so he could not, properly speaking, be called\ninexorable. He looked at me for a moment with an air of annoyance and\nsurprise, and then when Mamma had told him, not without some\nembarrassment, what had happened, said to her: “Go along with him, then;\nyou said just now that you didn’t feel like sleep, so stay in his room for\na little. I don’t need anything.”",
        "“But dear,” my mother answered timidly, “whether or not I feel like sleep\nis not the point; we must not make the child accustomed...”",
        "“There’s no question of making him accustomed,” said my father, with a\nshrug of the shoulders; “you can see quite well that the child is unhappy.\nAfter all, we aren’t gaolers. You’ll end by making him ill, and a lot of\ngood that will do. There are two beds in his room; tell Françoise to make\nup the big one for you, and stay beside him for the rest of the night. I’m\noff to bed, anyhow; I’m not nervous like you. Good night.”",
        "It was impossible for me to thank my father; what he called my\nsentimentality would have exasperated him. I stood there, not daring to\nmove; he was still confronting us, an immense figure in his white\nnightshirt, crowned with the pink and violet scarf of Indian cashmere in\nwhich, since he had begun to suffer from neuralgia, he used to tie up his\nhead, standing like Abraham in the engraving after Benozzo Gozzoli which\nM. Swann had given me, telling Sarah that she must tear herself away from\nIsaac. Many years have passed since that night. The wall of the staircase,\nup which I had watched the light of his candle gradually climb, was long\nago demolished.  And in myself, too, many things have perished which, I\nimagined, would last for ever, and new structures have arisen, giving\nbirth to new sorrows and new joys which in those days I could not have\nforeseen, just as now the old are difficult of comprehension. It is a long\ntime, too, since my father has been able to tell Mamma to “Go with the\nchild.” Never again will such hours be possible for me. But of late I have\nbeen increasingly able to catch, if I listen attentively, the sound of the\nsobs which I had the strength to control in my father’s presence, and\nwhich broke out only when I found myself alone with Mamma. Actually, their\necho has never ceased: it is only because life is now growing more and\nmore quiet round about me that I hear them afresh, like those convent\nbells which are so effectively drowned during the day by the noises of the\nstreets that one would suppose them to have been stopped for ever, until\nthey sound out again through the silent evening air.",
        "Mamma spent that night in my room: when I had just committed a sin so\ndeadly that I was waiting to be banished from the household, my parents\ngave me a far greater concession than I should ever have won as the reward\nof a good action. Even at the moment when it manifested itself in this\ncrowning mercy, my father’s conduct towards me was still somewhat\narbitrary, and regardless of my deserts, as was characteristic of him and\ndue to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance\nexpediencies rather than based on any formal plan. And perhaps even what I\ncalled his strictness, when he sent me off to bed, deserved that title\nless, really, than my mother’s or grandmother’s attitude, for his nature,\nwhich in some respects differed more than theirs from my own, had probably\nprevented him from guessing, until then, how wretched I was every evening,\na thing which my mother and grandmother knew well; but they loved me\nenough to be unwilling to spare me that suffering, which they hoped to\nteach me to overcome, so as to reduce my nervous sensibility and to\nstrengthen my will. As for my father, whose affection for me was of\nanother kind, I doubt if he would have shewn so much courage, for as soon\nas he had grasped the fact that I was unhappy he had said to my mother:\n\"Go and comfort him.” Mamma stayed all night in my room, and it seemed\nthat she did not wish to mar by recrimination those hours, so different\nfrom anything that I had had a right to expect; for when Françoise (who\nguessed that something extraordinary must have happened when she saw Mamma\nsitting by my side, holding my hand and letting me cry unchecked) said to\nher: “But, Madame, what is little Master crying for?” she replied: “Why,\nFrançoise, he doesn’t know himself: it is his nerves. Make up the big bed\nfor me quickly and then go off to your own.” And thus for the first time\nmy unhappiness was regarded no longer as a fault for which I must be\npunished, but as an involuntary evil which had been officially recognised\na nervous condition for which I was in no way responsible: I had the\nconsolation that I need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the\nbitterness of my tears; I could weep henceforward without sin. I felt no\nsmall degree of pride, either, in Franchise’s presence at this return to\nhumane conditions which, not an hour after Mamma had refused to come up to\nmy room and had sent the snubbing message that I was to go to sleep,\nraised me to the dignity of a grown-up person, brought me of a sudden to a\nsort of puberty of sorrow, to emancipation from tears. I ought then to\nhave been happy; I was not. It struck me that my mother had just made a\nfirst concession which must have been painful to her, that it was a first\nstep down from the ideal she had formed for me, and that for the first\ntime she, with all her courage, had to confess herself beaten. It struck\nme that if I had just scored a victory it was over her; that I had\nsucceeded, as sickness or sorrow or age might have succeeded, in relaxing\nher will, in altering her judgment; that this evening opened a new era,\nmust remain a black date in the calendar.  And if I had dared now, I\nshould have said to Mamma: “No, I don’t want you; you mustn’t sleep here.\"\nBut I was conscious of the practical wisdom, of what would be called\nnowadays the realism with which she tempered the ardent idealism of my\ngrandmother’s nature, and I knew that now the mischief was done she would\nprefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of her company, and not to\ndisturb my father again. Certainly my mother’s beautiful features seemed\nto shine again with youth that evening, as she sat gently holding my hands\nand trying to check my tears; but, just for that reason, it seemed to me\nthat this should not have happened; her anger would have been less\ndifficult to endure than this new kindness which my childhood had not\nknown; I felt that I had with an impious and secret finger traced a first\nwrinkle upon her soul and made the first white hair shew upon her head.\nThis thought redoubled my sobs, and then I saw that Mamma, who had never\nallowed herself to go to any length of tenderness with me, was suddenly\novercome by my tears and had to struggle to keep back her own. Then, as\nshe saw that I had noticed this, she said to me, with a smile: “Why, my\nlittle buttercup, my little canary-boy, he’s going to make Mamma as silly\nas himself if this goes on. Look, since you can’t sleep, and Mamma can’t\neither, we mustn’t go on in this stupid way; we must do something; I’ll\nget one of your books.” But I had none there. “Would you like me to get\nout the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your\nbirthday? Just think it over first, and don’t be disappointed if there is\nnothing new for you then.”",
        "I was only too delighted, and Mamma went to find a parcel of books in\nwhich I could not distinguish, through the paper in which it was wrapped,\nany more than its squareness and size, but which, even at this first\nglimpse, brief and obscure as it was, bade fair to eclipse already the\npaint-box of last New Year’s Day and the silkworms of the year before. It\ncontained La Mare au Diable, François le Champi, La Petite Fadette,\nand Les Maîtres Sonneurs. My grandmother, as I learned afterwards, had\nat first chosen Mussel’s poems, a volume of Rousseau, and Indiana; for\nwhile she considered light reading as unwholesome as sweets and cakes, she\ndid not reflect that the strong breath of genius must have upon the very\nsoul of a child an influence at once more dangerous and less quickening\nthan those of fresh air and country breezes upon his body. But when my\nfather had seemed almost to regard her as insane on learning the names of\nthe books she proposed to give me, she had journeyed back by herself to\nJouy-le-Vicomte to the bookseller’s, so that there should be no fear of my\nnot having my present in time (it was a burning hot day, and she had come\nhome so unwell that the doctor had warned my mother not to allow her again\nto tire herself in that way), and had there fallen back upon the four\npastoral novels of George Sand.",
        "“My dear,” she had said to Mamma, “I could not allow myself to give the\nchild anything that was not well written.”",
        "The truth was that she could never make up her mind to purchase anything\nfrom which no intellectual profit was to be derived, and, above all, that\nprofit which good things bestowed on us by teaching us to seek our\npleasures elsewhere than in the barren satisfaction of worldly wealth.\nEven when she had to make some one a present of the kind called ’useful,’\nwhen she had to give an armchair or some table-silver or a walking-stick,\nshe would choose ’antiques,’ as though their long desuetude had effaced\nfrom them any semblance of utility and fitted them rather to instruct us\nin the lives of the men of other days than to serve the common\nrequirements of our own. She would have liked me to have in my room\nphotographs of ancient buildings or of beautiful places. But at the moment\nof buying them, and for all that the subject of the picture had an\naesthetic value of its own, she would find that vulgarity and utility had\ntoo prominent a part in them, through the mechanical nature of their\nreproduction by photography. She attempted by a subterfuge, if not to\neliminate altogether their commercial banality, at least to minimise it,\nto substitute for the bulk of it what was art still, to introduce, as it\nmight be, several ’thicknesses’ of art; instead of photographs of Chartres\nCathedral, of the Fountains of Saint-Cloud, or of Vesuvius she would\ninquire of Swann whether some great painter had not made pictures of them,\nand preferred to give me photographs of ’Chartres Cathedral’ after Corot,\nof the ’Fountains of Saint-Cloud’ after Hubert Robert, and of ’Vesuvius’\nafter Turner, which were a stage higher in the scale of art. But although\nthe photographer had been prevented from reproducing directly the\nmasterpieces or the beauties of nature, and had there been replaced by a\ngreat artist, he resumed his odious position when it came to reproducing\nthe artist’s interpretation.  Accordingly, having to reckon again with\nvulgarity, my grandmother would endeavour to postpone the moment of\ncontact still further. She would ask Swann if the picture had not been\nengraved, preferring, when possible, old engravings with some interest of\nassociation apart from themselves, such, for example, as shew us a\nmasterpiece in a state in which we can no longer see it to-day, as\nMorghen’s print of the ’Cenacolo’ of Leonardo before it was spoiled by\nrestoration. It must be admitted that the results of this method of\ninterpreting the art of making presents were not always happy.  The idea\nwhich I formed of Venice, from a drawing by Titian which is supposed to\nhave the lagoon in the background, was certainly far less accurate than\nwhat I have since derived from ordinary photographs. We could no longer\nkeep count in the family (when my great-aunt tried to frame an indictment\nof my grandmother) of all the armchairs she had presented to married\ncouples, young and old, which on a first attempt to sit down upon them had\nat once collapsed beneath the weight of their recipient. But my\ngrandmother would have thought it sordid to concern herself too closely\nwith the solidity of any piece of furniture in which could still be\ndiscerned a flourish, a smile, a brave conceit of the past. And even what\nin such pieces supplied a material need, since it did so in a manner to\nwhich we are no longer accustomed, was as charming to her as one of those\nold forms of speech in which we can still see traces of a metaphor whose\nfine point has been worn away by the rough usage of our modern tongue. In\nprecisely the same way the pastoral novels of George Sand, which she was\ngiving me for my birthday, were regular lumber-rooms of antique furniture,\nfull of expressions that have fallen out of use and returned as imagery,\nsuch as one finds now only in country dialects. And my grandmother had\nbought them in preference to other books, just as she would have preferred\nto take a house that had a gothic dovecot, or some other such piece of\nantiquity as would have a pleasant effect on the mind, filling it with a\nnostalgic longing for impossible journeys through the realms of time.",
        "Mamma sat down by my bed; she had chosen François le Champi, whose\nreddish cover and incomprehensible title gave it a distinct personality in\nmy eyes and a mysterious attraction. I had not then read any real novels.\nI had heard it said that George Sand was a typical novelist. That prepared\nme in advance to imagine that François le Champi contained something\ninexpressibly delicious. The course of the narrative, where it tended to\narouse curiosity or melt to pity, certain modes of expression which\ndisturb or sadden the reader, and which, with a little experience, he may\nrecognise as ’common form’ in novels, seemed to me then distinctive–for\nto me a new book was not one of a number of similar objects, but was like\nan individual man, unmatched, and with no cause of existence beyond\nhimself–an intoxicating whiff of the peculiar essence of François le\nChampi. Beneath the everyday incidents, the commonplace thoughts and\nhackneyed words, I could hear, or overhear, an intonation, a rhythmic\nutterance fine and strange. The ’action’ began: to me it seemed all the\nmore obscure because in those days, when I read to myself, I used often,\nwhile I turned the pages, to dream of something quite different. And to\nthe gaps which this habit made in my knowledge of the story more were\nadded by the fact that when it was Mamma who was reading to me aloud she\nleft all the love-scenes out. And so all the odd changes which take place\nin the relations between the miller’s wife and the boy, changes which only\nthe birth and growth of love can explain, seemed to me plunged and steeped\nin a mystery, the key to which (as I could readily believe) lay in that\nstrange and pleasant-sounding name of Champi, which draped the boy who\nbore it, I knew not why, in its own bright colour, purpurate and charming.\nIf my mother was not a faithful reader, she was, none the less, admirable\nwhen reading a work in which she found the note of true feeling by the\nrespectful simplicity of her interpretation and by the sound of her sweet\nand gentle voice. It was the same in her daily life, when it was not works\nof art but men and women whom she was moved to pity or admire: it was\ntouching to observe with what deference she would banish from her voice,\nher gestures, from her whole conversation, now the note of joy which might\nhave distressed some mother who had long ago lost a child, now the\nrecollection of an event or anniversary which might have reminded some old\ngentleman of the burden of his years, now the household topic which might\nhave bored some young man of letters. And so, when she read aloud the\nprose of George Sand, prose which is everywhere redolent of that\ngenerosity and moral distinction which Mamma had learned from my\ngrandmother to place above all other qualities in life, and which I was\nnot to teach her until much later to refrain from placing, in the same\nway, above all other qualities in literature; taking pains to banish from\nher voice any weakness or affectation which might have blocked its channel\nfor that powerful stream of language, she supplied all the natural\ntenderness, all the lavish sweetness which they demanded to phrases which\nseemed to have been composed for her voice, and which were all, so to\nspeak, within her compass.  She came to them with the tone that they\nrequired, with the cordial accent which existed before they were, which\ndictated them, but which is not to be found in the words themselves, and\nby these means she smoothed away, as she read on, any harshness there\nmight be or discordance in the tenses of verbs, endowing the imperfect and\nthe preterite with all the sweetness which there is in generosity, all the\nmelancholy which there is in love; guided the sentence that was drawing to\nan end towards that which was waiting to begin, now hastening, now\nslackening the pace of the syllables so as to bring them, despite their\ndifference of quantity, into a uniform rhythm, and breathed into this\nquite ordinary prose a kind of life, continuous and full of feeling.",
        "My agony was soothed; I let myself be borne upon the current of this\ngentle night on which I had my mother by my side. I knew that such a night\ncould not be repeated; that the strongest desire I had in the world,\nnamely, to keep my mother in my room through the sad hours of darkness,\nran too much counter to general requirements and to the wishes of others\nfor such a concession as had been granted me this evening to be anything\nbut a rare and casual exception. To-morrow night I should again be the\nvictim of anguish and Mamma would not stay by my side. But when these\nstorms of anguish grew calm I could no longer realise their existence;\nbesides, tomorrow evening was still a long way off; I reminded myself that\nI should still have time to think about things, albeit that remission of\ntime could bring me no access of power, albeit the coming event was in no\nway dependent upon the exercise of my will, and seemed not quite\ninevitable only because it was still separated from me by this short\ninterval.",
        "And so it was that, for a long time afterwards, when I lay awake at night\nand revived old memories of Combray, I saw no more of it than this sort of\nluminous panel, sharply defined against a vague and shadowy background,\nlike the panels which a Bengal fire or some electric sign will illuminate\nand dissect from the front of a building the other parts of which remain\nplunged in darkness: broad enough at its base, the little parlour, the\ndining-room, the alluring shadows of the path along which would come M.\nSwann, the unconscious author of my sufferings, the hall through which I\nwould journey to the first step of that staircase, so hard to climb, which\nconstituted, all by itself, the tapering ’elevation’ of an irregular\npyramid; and, at the summit, my bedroom, with the little passage through\nwhose glazed door Mamma would enter; in a word, seen always at the same\nevening hour, isolated from all its possible surroundings, detached and\nsolitary against its shadowy background, the bare minimum of scenery\nnecessary (like the setting one sees printed at the head of an old play,\nfor its performance in the provinces) to the drama of my undressing, as\nthough all Combray had consisted of but two floors joined by a slender\nstaircase, and as though there had been no time there but seven o’clock at\nnight. I must own that I could have assured any questioner that Combray\ndid include other scenes and did exist at other hours than these. But\nsince the facts which I should then have recalled would have been prompted\nonly by an exercise of the will, by my intellectual memory, and since the\npictures which that kind of memory shews us of the past preserve nothing\nof the past itself, I should never have had any wish to ponder over this\nresidue of Combray. To me it was in reality all dead.",
        "Permanently dead? Very possibly.",
        "There is a large element of hazard in these matters, and a second hazard,\nthat of our own death, often prevents us from awaiting for any length of\ntime the favours of the first.",
        "I feel that there is much to be said for the Celtic belief that the souls\nof those whom we have lost are held captive in some inferior being, in an\nanimal, in a plant, in some inanimate object, and so effectively lost to\nus until the day (which to many never comes) when we happen to pass by the\ntree or to obtain possession of the object which forms their prison. Then\nthey start and tremble, they call us by our name, and as soon as we have\nrecognised their voice the spell is broken. We have delivered them: they\nhave overcome death and return to share our life.",
        "And so it is with our own past. It is a labour in vain to attempt to\nrecapture it: all the efforts of our intellect must prove futile. The past\nis hidden somewhere outside the realm, beyond the reach of intellect, in\nsome material object (in the sensation which that material object will\ngive us) which we do not suspect. And as for that object, it depends on\nchance whether we come upon it or not before we ourselves must die.",
        "Many years had elapsed during which nothing of Combray, save what was\ncomprised in the theatre and the drama of my going to bed there, had any\nexistence for me, when one day in winter, as I came home, my mother,\nseeing that I was cold, offered me some tea, a thing I did not ordinarily\ntake. I declined at first, and then, for no particular reason, changed my\nmind. She sent out for one of those short, plump little cakes called\n’petites madeleines,’ which look as though they had been moulded in the\nfluted scallop of a pilgrim’s shell. And soon, mechanically, weary after a\ndull day with the prospect of a depressing morrow, I raised to my lips a\nspoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the cake. No sooner\nhad the warm liquid, and the crumbs with it, touched my palate than a\nshudder ran through my whole body, and I stopped, intent upon the\nextraordinary changes that were taking place. An exquisite pleasure had\ninvaded my senses, but individual, detached, with no suggestion of its\norigin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me,\nits disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory–this new sensation having\nhad on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence;\nor rather this essence was not in me, it was myself. I had ceased now to\nfeel mediocre, accidental, mortal. Whence could it have come to me, this\nall-powerful joy? I was conscious that it was connected with the taste of\ntea and cake, but that it infinitely transcended those savours, could not,\nindeed, be of the same nature as theirs. Whence did it come? What did it\nsignify? How could I seize upon and define it?",
        "I drink a second mouthful, in which I find nothing more than in the first,\na third, which gives me rather less than the second. It is time to stop;\nthe potion is losing its magic. It is plain that the object of my quest,\nthe truth, lies not in the cup but in myself. The tea has called up in me,\nbut does not itself understand, and can only repeat indefinitely with a\ngradual loss of strength, the same testimony; which I, too, cannot\ninterpret, though I hope at least to be able to call upon the tea for it\nagain and to find it there presently, intact and at my disposal, for my\nfinal enlightenment. I put down my cup and examine my own mind. It is for\nit to discover the truth. But how? What an abyss of uncertainty whenever\nthe mind feels that some part of it has strayed beyond its own borders;\nwhen it, the seeker, is at once the dark region through which it must go\nseeking, where all its equipment will avail it nothing. Seek? More than\nthat: create. It is face to face with something which does not so far\nexist, to which it alone can give reality and substance, which it alone\ncan bring into the light of day.",
        "And I begin again to ask myself what it could have been, this\nunremembered state which brought with it no logical proof of its\nexistence, but only the sense that it was a happy, that it was a real\nstate in whose presence other states of consciousness melted and vanished.\nI decide to attempt to make it reappear. I retrace my thoughts to the\nmoment at which I drank the first spoonful of tea. I find again the same\nstate, illumined by no fresh light. I compel my mind to make one further\neffort, to follow and recapture once again the fleeting sensation. And\nthat nothing may interrupt it in its course I shut out every obstacle,\nevery extraneous idea, I stop my ears and inhibit all attention to the\nsounds which come from the next room.  And then, feeling that my mind is\ngrowing fatigued without having any success to report, I compel it for a\nchange to enjoy that distraction which I have just denied it, to think of\nother things, to rest and refresh itself before the supreme attempt. And\nthen for the second time I clear an empty space in front of it. I place in\nposition before my mind’s eye the still recent taste of that first\nmouthful, and I feel something start within me, something that leaves its\nresting-place and attempts to rise, something that has been embedded like\nan anchor at a great depth; I do not know yet what it is, but I can feel\nit mounting slowly; I can measure the resistance, I can hear the echo of\ngreat spaces traversed.",
        "Undoubtedly what is thus palpitating in the depths of my being must be the\nimage, the visual memory which, being linked to that taste, has tried to\nfollow it into my conscious mind. But its struggles are too far off, too\nmuch confused; scarcely can I perceive the colourless reflection in which\nare blended the uncapturable whirling medley of radiant hues, and I cannot\ndistinguish its form, cannot invite it, as the one possible interpreter,\nto translate to me the evidence of its contemporary, its inseparable\nparamour, the taste of cake soaked in tea; cannot ask it to inform me what\nspecial circumstance is in question, of what period in my past life.",
        "Will it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness, this\nmemory, this old, dead moment which the magnetism of an identical moment\nhas travelled so far to importune, to disturb, to raise up out of the very\ndepths of my being? I cannot tell. Now that I feel nothing, it has\nstopped, has perhaps gone down again into its darkness, from which who can\nsay whether it will ever rise? Ten times over I must essay the task, must\nlean down over the abyss. And each time the natural laziness which deters\nus from every difficult enterprise, every work of importance, has urged me\nto leave the thing alone, to drink my tea and to think merely of the\nworries of to-day and of my hopes for to-morrow, which let themselves be\npondered over without effort or distress of mind.",
        "And suddenly the memory returns. The taste was that of the little crumb of\nmadeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I\ndid not go out before church-time), when I went to say good day to her in\nher bedroom, my aunt Léonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own\ncup of real or of lime-flower tea. The sight of the little madeleine had\nrecalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it; perhaps because I had so\noften seen such things in the interval, without tasting them, on the trays\nin pastry-cooks’ windows, that their image had dissociated itself from\nthose Combray days to take its place among others more recent; perhaps\nbecause of those memories, so long abandoned and put out of mind, nothing\nnow survived, everything was scattered; the forms of things, including\nthat of the little scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual under its\nsevere, religious folds, were either obliterated or had been so long\ndormant as to have lost the power of expansion which would have allowed\nthem to resume their place in my consciousness. But when from a\nlong-distant past nothing subsists, after the people are dead, after the\nthings are broken and scattered, still, alone, more fragile, but with more\nvitality, more unsubstantial, more persistent, more faithful, the smell\nand taste of things remain poised a long time, like souls, ready to remind\nus, waiting and hoping for their moment, amid the ruins of all the rest;\nand bear unfaltering, in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their\nessence, the vast structure of recollection.",
        "And once I had recognized the taste of the crumb of madeleine soaked in\nher decoction of lime-flowers which my aunt used to give me (although I\ndid not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory\nmade me so happy) immediately the old grey house upon the street, where\nher room was, rose up like the scenery of a theatre to attach itself to\nthe little pavilion, opening on to the garden, which had been built out\nbehind it for my parents (the isolated panel which until that moment had\nbeen all that I could see); and with the house the town, from morning to\nnight and in all weathers, the Square where I was sent before luncheon,\nthe streets along which I used to run errands, the country roads we took\nwhen it was fine. And just as the Japanese amuse themselves by filling a\nporcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little crumbs of paper which\nuntil then are without character or form, but, the moment they become wet,\nstretch themselves and bend, take on colour and distinctive shape, become\nflowers or houses or people, permanent and recognisable, so in that moment\nall the flowers in our garden and in M. Swann’s park, and the water-lilies\non the Vivonne and the good folk of the village and their little dwellings\nand the parish church and the whole of Combray and of its surroundings,\ntaking their proper shapes and growing solid, sprang into being, town and\ngardens alike, from my cup of tea.",
        "Combray at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used to see it\nfrom the railway when we arrived there every year in Holy Week, was no\nmore than a church epitomising the town, representing it, speaking of it\nand for it to the horizon, and as one drew near, gathering close about its\nlong, dark cloak, sheltering from the wind, on the open plain, as a\nshepherd gathers his sheep, the woolly grey backs of its flocking houses,\nwhich a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed, here and there, in an\noutline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town in a primitive\npainting. To live in, Combray was a trifle depressing, like its streets,\nwhose houses, built of the blackened stone of the country, fronted with\noutside steps, capped with gables which projected long shadows downwards,\nwere so dark that one had, as soon as the sun began to go down, to draw\nback the curtains in the sitting-room windows; streets with the solemn\nnames of Saints, not a few of whom figured in the history of the early\nlords of Combray, such as the Rue Saint-Hilaire, the Rue Saint-Jacques, in\nwhich my aunt’s house stood, the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde, which ran past her\nrailings, and the Rue du Saint-Esprit, on to which the little garden gate\nopened; and these Combray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my\nmemory, painted in colours so different from those in which the world is\ndecked for me to-day, that in fact one and all of them, and the church\nwhich towered above them in the Square, seem to me now more unsubstantial\nthan the projections of my magic-lantern; while at times I feel that to be\nable to cross the Rue Saint-Hilaire again, to engage a room in the Rue de\nl’Oiseau, in the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesché, from whose windows in\nthe pavement used to rise a smell of cooking which rises still in my mind,\nnow and then, in the same warm gusts of comfort, would be to secure a\ncontact with the unseen world more marvellously supernatural than it would\nbe to make Golo’s acquaintance and to chat with Geneviève de Brabant.",
        "My grandfather’s cousin–by courtesy my great-aunt–with whom we used to\nstay, was the mother of that aunt Léonie who, since her husband’s (my\nuncle Octave’s) death, had gradually declined to leave, first Combray,\nthen her house in Combray, then her bedroom, and finally her bed; and who\nnow never ’came down,’ but lay perpetually in an indefinite condition of\ngrief, physical exhaustion, illness, obsessions, and religious\nobservances.  Her own room looked out over the Rue Saint-Jacques, which\nran a long way further to end in the Grand-Pré (as distinct from the\nPetit-Pré, a green space in the centre of the town where three streets\nmet) and which, monotonous and grey, with the three high steps of stone\nbefore almost every one of its doors, seemed like a deep furrow cut by\nsome sculptor of gothic images in the very block of stone out of which he\nhad fashioned a Calvary or a Crib. My aunt’s life was now practically\nconfined to two adjoining rooms, in one of which she would rest in the\nafternoon while they, aired the other. They were rooms of that country\norder which (just as in certain climes whole tracts of air or ocean are\nilluminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which we cannot see)\nfascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours springing from\ntheir own special virtues, wisdom, habits, a whole secret system of life,\ninvisible, superabundant and profoundly moral, which their atmosphere\nholds in solution; smells natural enough indeed, and coloured by\ncircumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside, but already\nhumanised, domesticated, confined, an exquisite, skilful, limpid jelly,\nblending all the fruits of the season which have left the orchard for the\nstore-room, smells changing with the year, but plenishing, domestic\nsmells, which compensate for the sharpness of hoar frost with the sweet\nsavour of warm bread, smells lazy and punctual as a village clock, roving\nsmells, pious smells; rejoicing in a peace which brings only an increase\nof anxiety, and in a prosiness which serves as a deep source of poetry to\nthe stranger who passes through their midst without having lived amongst\nthem. The air of those rooms was saturated with the fine bouquet of a\nsilence so nourishing, so succulent that I could not enter them without a\nsort of greedy enjoyment, particularly on those first mornings, chilly\nstill, of the Easter holidays, when I could taste it more fully, because I\nhad just arrived then at Combray: before I went in to wish my aunt good\nday I would be kept waiting a little time in the outer room, where the\nsun, a wintry sun still, had crept in to warm itself before the fire,\nlighted already between its two brick sides and plastering all the room\nand everything in it with a smell of soot, making the room like one of\nthose great open hearths which one finds in the country, or one of the\ncanopied mantelpieces in old castles under which one sits hoping that in\nthe world outside it is raining or snowing, hoping almost for a\ncatastrophic deluge to add the romance of shelter and security to the\ncomfort of a snug retreat; I would turn to and fro between the prayer-desk\nand the stamped velvet armchairs, each one always draped in its crocheted\nantimacassar, while the fire, baking like a pie the appetising smells with\nwhich the air of the room, was thickly clotted, which the dewy and sunny\nfreshness of the morning had already ’raised’ and started to ’set,’ puffed\nthem and glazed them and fluted them and swelled them into an invisible\nthough not impalpable country cake, an immense puff-pastry, in which,\nbarely waiting to savour the crustier, more delicate, more respectable,\nbut also drier smells of the cupboard, the chest-of-drawers, and the\npatterned wall-paper I always returned with an unconfessed gluttony to\nbury myself in the nondescript, resinous, dull, indigestible, and fruity\nsmell of the flowered quilt.",
        "In the next room I could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself. She\nnever spoke save in low tones, because she believed that there was\nsomething broken in her head and floating loose there, which she might\ndisplace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when\nalone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good for\nher throat, and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it would\nmake less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable;\nbesides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the\nleast of her sensations an extraordinary importance, endowed them with a\nProtean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret, and,\nfailing a confidant to whom she might communicate them, she used to\npromulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole\nform of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the habit of thinking\naloud, she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the\nadjoining room, and I would often hear her saying to herself: “I must not\nforget that I never slept a wink\"–for “never sleeping a wink” was her\ngreat claim to distinction, and one admitted and respected in our\nhousehold vocabulary; in the morning Françoise would not ’call’ her, but\nwould simply ’come to’ her; during the day, when my aunt wished to take a\nnap, we used to say just that she wished to ’be quiet’ or to ’rest’; and\nwhen in conversation she so far forgot herself as to say “what made me\nwake up,” or “I dreamed that,” she would flush and at once correct\nherself.",
        "After waiting a minute, I would go in and kiss her; Françoise would be\nmaking her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling ’upset,’ she would ask instead\nfor her ’tisane,’ and it would be my duty to shake out of the chemist’s\nlittle package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom required for\ninfusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had twisted them into a\nfantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale flowers opened, as though a\npainter had arranged them there, grouping them in the most decorative\nposes. The leaves, which had lost or altered their own appearance, assumed\nthose instead of the most incongruous things imaginable, as though the\ntransparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of\nroses had been collected and pounded, or interwoven as birds weave the\nmaterial for their nests. A thousand trifling little details–the charming\nprodigality of the chemist–details which would have been eliminated from\nan artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished\nto read the name of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that\nthese were indeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming\nfrom the train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they\nwere not imitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And\nas each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in\nthese little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time;\nbut beyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms\namong the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden\nroses–marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of\na vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree which\nhad and those which had not been ’in bloom’–shewed me that these were\npetals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist’s package had\nembalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still their\ncolour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life which\nwas now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower.\nPresently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she\nwould relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of\nwhich she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft.",
        "At one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of lemon-wood,\nand a table which served at once as pharmacy and as high altar, on which,\nbeneath a statue of Our Lady and a bottle of Vichy-Célestins, might be\nfound her service-books and her medical prescriptions, everything that she\nneeded for the performance, in bed, of her duties to soul and body, to\nkeep the proper times for pepsin and for vespers. On the other side her\nbed was bounded by the window: she had the street beneath her eyes, and\nwould read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life,\nlike a Persian prince, the daily but immemorial chronicles of Combray,\nwhich she would discuss in detail afterwards with Françoise.",
        "I would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me\naway in case I made her tired. She would hold out for me to kiss her sad\nbrow, pale and lifeless, on which at this early hour she would not yet\nhave arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the\npoints of a crown of thorns–or the beads of a rosary, and she would say to\nme: “Now, my poor child, you must go away; go and get ready for mass; and\nif you see Françoise downstairs, tell her not to stay too long amusing\nherself with you; she must come up soon to see if I want anything.”",
        "Françoise, who had been for many years in my aunt’s service and did not at\nthat time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours,\nwas a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent\nin her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went to\nCombray, and when my aunt Léonie used still to spend the winter in Paris\nwith her mother, a time when I knew Françoise so little that on New Year’s\nDay, before going into my great-aunt’s house, my mother put a five-franc\npiece in my hand and said: “Now, be careful. Don’t make any mistake. Wait\nuntil you hear me say ’Good morning, Françoise,’ and I touch your arm\nbefore you give it to her.” No sooner had we arrived in my aunt’s dark\nhall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff\nand fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of\na smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Françoise, motionless and erect,\nframed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in\nits niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we\ncould discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity,\nblended with a tender respect for the ’upper classes’ which raised to the\nmost honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward.\nMamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice: “Good morning,\nFrançoise.” At this signal my fingers parted and I let fall the coin,\nwhich found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we\nhad begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Françoise.\nWe were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed\nthe same consideration for us as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener\nrelish, because we had, in addition to our dignity as part of ’the family’\n(for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites\nthe members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh\ncharm of not being her customary employers.  And so with what joy would\nshe welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so\nbad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was\noften an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her\nnephews, and if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to\nmake of him, and whether he took after his granny.",
        "Later, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Françoise\nwas still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would\nspeak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and\ntheir lives.",
        "She had guessed that Françoise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and\nthat he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the\ntwo could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when\nFrançoise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said to\nher, with a smile: “Tell me, Françoise, if Julien has had to go away, and\nyou have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but will\nmake the best of it, won’t you?”",
        "And Françoise answered, laughing: “Madame knows everything; Madame is\nworse than the X-rays” (she pronounced ’x’ with an affectation of\ndifficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered woman’s,\ndaring to employ a scientific term) “they brought here for Mme.  Octave,\nwhich see what is in your heart\"–and she went off, disturbed that anyone\nshould be caring about her, perhaps anxious that we should not see her in\ntears: Mamma was the first person who had given her the pleasure of\nfeeling that her peasant existence, with its simple joys and sorrows,\nmight offer some interest, might be a source of grief or pleasure to some\none other than herself.",
        "My aunt resigned herself to doing without Françoise to some extent during\nour visits, knowing how much my mother appreciated the services of so\nactive and intelligent a maid, one who looked as smart at five o’clock in\nthe morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills\nseemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for churchgoing; who did\neverything in the right way, who toiled like a horse, whether she was well\nor ill, but without noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the\nonly one of my aunt’s maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black\ncoffee would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants\nwho in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger,\ndoubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew\nhim no special attention, knowing very well that they have no real need of\nhim, that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will\nbe dismissed from it; who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to\nthose masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real\ncapacity, and do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that\nslavish affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often\nconceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can\nproduce the least trace of individuality.",
        "When Françoise, having seen that my parents had everything they required,\nfirst went upstairs again to give my aunt her pepsin and to find out from\nher what she would take for luncheon, very few mornings pased but she was\ncalled upon to give an opinion, or to furnish an explanation, in regard to\nsome important event.",
        "“Just fancy, Françoise, Mme. Goupil went by more than a quarter of an hour\nlate to fetch her sister: if she loses any more time on the way I should\nnot be at all surprised if she got in after the Elevation.”",
        "“Well, there’d be nothing wonderful in that,” would be the answer. Or:",
        "“Françoise, if you had come in five minutes ago, you would have seen Mme.\nImbert go past with some asparagus twice the size of what mother Callot\nhas: do try to find out from her cook where she got them. You know you’ve\nbeen putting asparagus in all your sauces this spring; you might be able\nto get some like these for our visitors.”",
        "“I shouldn’t be surprised if they came from the Curé’s,” Françoise would\nsay, and:",
        "“I’m sure you wouldn’t, my poor Françoise,” my aunt would reply, raising\nher shoulders. “From the Curé’s, indeed! You know quite well that he can\nnever grow anything but wretched little twigs of asparagus, not asparagus\nat all. I tell you these ones were as thick as my arm. Not your arm, of\ncourse, but my-poor arm, which has grown so much thinner again this year.\"\nOr:",
        "“Françoise, didn’t you hear that bell just now! It split my head.”",
        "“No, Mme. Octave.”",
        "“Ah, poor girl, your skull must be very thick; you may thank God for that.\nIt was Maguelone come to fetch Dr. Piperaud. He came out with her at once\nand they went off along the Rue de l’Oiseau. There must be some child\nill.”",
        "“Oh dear, dear; the poor little creature!” would come with a sigh from\nFrançoise, who could not hear of any calamity befalling a person unknown\nto her, even in some distant part of the world, without beginning to\nlament. Or:",
        "“Françoise, for whom did they toll the passing-bell just now? Oh dear, of\ncourse, it would be for Mme. Rousseau. And to think that I had forgotten\nthat she passed away the other night. Indeed, it is time the Lord called\nme home too; I don’t know what has become of my head since I lost my poor\nOctave. But I am wasting your time, my good girl.”",
        "“Indeed no, Mme. Octave, my time is not so precious; whoever made our time\ndidn’t sell it to us. I am just going to see that my fire hasn’t gone\nout.”",
        "In this way Françoise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them,\nin the course of these morning sessions, of the earliest happenings of the\nday. But sometimes these happenings assumed so mysterious or so alarming\nan air that my aunt felt she could not wait until it was time for\nFrançoise to come upstairs, and then a formidable and quadruple peal would\nresound through the house.",
        "“But, Mme. Octave, it is not time for your pepsin,” Françoise would begin.\n\"Are you feeling faint?”",
        "“No, thank you, Françoise,” my aunt would reply, “that is to say, yes; for\nyou know well that there is very seldom a time when I don’t feel faint;\none day I shall pass away like Mme. Rousseau, before I know where I am;\nbut that is not why I rang. Would you believe that I have just seen, as\nplainly as I see you, Mme. Goupil with a little girl I didn’t know at all.\nRun and get a pennyworth of salt from Camus. It’s not often that Théodore\ncan’t tell you who a person is.”",
        "“But that must be M. Pupin’s daughter,” Françoise would say, preferring to\nstick to an immediate explanation, since she had been perhaps twice\nalready into Camus’s shop that morning.",
        "“M. Pupin’s daughter! Oh, that’s a likely story, my poor Françoise.  Do\nyou think I should not have recognised M. Pupin’s daughter!”",
        "“But I don’t mean the big one, Mme. Octave; I mean the little girl, he one\nwho goes to school at Jouy. I seem to have seen her once already his\nmorning.”",
        "“Oh, if that’s what it is!” my aunt would say, “she must have come over\nfor the holidays. Yes, that is it. No need to ask, she will have come over\nfor the holidays. But then we shall soon see Mme. Sazerat come along and\nring her sister’s door-bell, for her luncheon. That will be it! I saw the\nboy from Galopin’s go by with a tart. You will see that the tart was for\nMme. Goupil.”",
        "“Once Mme. Goupil has anyone in the house, Mme. Octave, you won’t be long\nin seeing all her folk going in to their luncheon there, for it’s not so\nearly as it was,” would be the answer, for Françoise, who was anxious to\nretire downstairs to look after our own meal, was not sorry to leave my\naunt with the prospect of such a distraction.",
        "“Oh! not before midday!” my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation,\ndarting an uneasy glance at the clock, but stealthily, so as not to let it\nbe seen that she, who had renounced all earthly joys, yet found a keen\nsatisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil was expecting company to\nluncheon, though, alas, she must wait a little more than an hour still\nbefore enjoying the spectacle. “And it will come in the middle of my\nluncheon!” she would murmur to herself. Her luncheon was such a\ndistraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the same\ntime.  “At least, you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of\nthe flat plates?” These were the only plates which had pictures on them\nand my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description\non whichever might have been sent up to her. She would put on her\nspectacles and spell out: “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” “Aladdin, or\nthe Wonderful Lamp,” and smile, and say “Very good indeed.”",
        "“I may as well go across to Camus...” Françoise would hazard, seeing that\nmy aunt had no longer any intention of sending her there.",
        "“No, no; it’s not worth while now; it’s certain to be the Pupin girl.  My\npoor Françoise, I am sorry to have made you come upstairs for nothing.”",
        "But it was not for nothing, as my aunt well knew, that she had rung for\nFrançoise, since at Combray a person whom one ’didn’t know at all’ was as\nincredible a being as any mythological deity, and it was apt to be\nforgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the Rue\ndu Saint-Esprit or in the Square one of these bewildering phenomena,\ncareful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous\nmonster to the proportions of a person whom one ’did know,’ either\npersonally or in the abstract, in his or her civil status as being more or\nless closely related to some family in Combray. It would turn out to be\nMme.  Sauton’s son discharged from the army, or the Abbé Perdreau’s niece\ncome home from her convent, or the Curé’s brother, a tax-collector at\nChâteaudun, who had just retired on a pension or had come over to Combray\nfor the holidays. On first noticing them you have been impressed by the\nthought that there might be in Combray people whom you ’didn’t know at\nall,’ simply because, you had failed to recognise or identify them at\nonce. And yet long beforehand Mme. Sauton and the Curé had given warning\nthat they expected their ’strangers.’ In the evening, when I came in and\nwent upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk, if I was rash\nenough to say to her that we had passed, near the Pont-Vieux, a man whom\nmy grandfather didn’t know:",
        "“A man grandfather didn’t know at all!” she would exclaim. “That’s a\nlikely story.” None the less, she would be a little disturbed by the news,\nshe would wish to have the details correctly, and so my grandfather would\nbe summoned. “Who can it have been that you passed near the Pont-Vieux,\nuncle? A man you didn’t know at all?”",
        "“Why, of course I did,” my grandfather would answer; “it was Prosper, Mme.\nBouilleboeuf’s gardener’s brother.”",
        "“Ah, well!” my aunt would say, calm again but slightly flushed still; “and\nthe boy told me that you had passed a man you didn’t know at all!” After\nwhich I would be warned to be more careful of what I said, and not to\nupset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks. Everyone was so well known in\nCombray, animals as well as people, that if my aunt had happened to see a\ndog go by which she ’didn’t know at all’ she would think about it\nincessantly, devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem all\nher inductive talent and her leisure hours.",
        "“That will be Mme. Sazerat’s dog,” Françoise would suggest, without any\nreal conviction, but in the hope of peace, and so that my aunt should not\n’split her head.’",
        "“As if I didn’t know Mme. Sazerat’s dog!\"–for my aunt’s critical mind\nwould not so easily admit any fresh fact.",
        "“Ah, but that will be the new dog M. Galopin has brought her from\nLisieux.”",
        "“Oh, if that’s what it is!”",
        "“It seems, it’s a most engaging animal,” Françoise would go on, having got\nthe story from Théodore, “as clever as a Christian, always in a good\ntemper, always friendly, always everything that’s nice. It’s not often you\nsee an animal so well-behaved at that age. Mme. Octave, it’s high time I\nleft you; I can’t afford to stay here amusing myself; look, it’s nearly\nten o’clock and my fire not lighted yet, and I’ve still to dress the\nasparagus.”",
        "“What, Françoise, more asparagus! It’s a regular disease of asparagus you\nhave got this year: you will make our Parisians sick of it.”",
        "“No, no, Madame Octave, they like it well enough. They’ll be coming back\nfrom church soon as hungry as hunters, and they won’t eat it out of the\nback of their spoons, you’ll see.”",
        "“Church! why, they must be there now; you’d better not lose any time.  Go\nand look after your luncheon.”",
        "While my aunt gossiped on in this way with Françoise I would have\naccompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it: how clearly I can see it\nstill, our church at Combray! The old porch by which we went in, black,\nand full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of shape and deeply\nfurrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water stoup to which it led\nus) just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant-women\ngoing into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had\nmanaged by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress\nitself on the stone, to carve ruts in it like those made by cart-wheels\nupon stone gate-posts against which they are driven every day. Its\nmemorial stones, beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray,\nwho were buried there, furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual\npavement, were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter, for time had\nsoftened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like honey and flow\nbeyond their proper margins, either surging out in a milky, frothing wave,\nwashing from its place a florid gothic capital, drowning the white violets\nof the marble floor; or else reabsorbed into their limits, contracting\nstill further a crabbed Latin inscription, bringing a fresh touch of\nfantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters, closing together\ntwo letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately\nscattered. Its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the sun\nscarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside you might be certain of\nfine weather in church.  One of them was filled from top to bottom by a\nsolitary figure, like the king on a playing-card, who lived up there\nbeneath his canopy of stone, between earth and heaven; and in the blue\nlight of its slanting shadow, on weekdays sometimes, at noon, when there\nwas no service (at one of those rare moments when the airy, empty church,\nmore human somehow and more luxurious with the sun shewing off all its\nrich furnishings, seemed to have almost a habitable air, like the\nhall–all sculptured stone and painted glass–of some mediaeval mansion),\nyou might see Mme.  Sazerat kneel for an instant, laying down on the chair\nbeside her own a neatly corded parcel of little cakes which she had just\nbought at the baker’s and was taking home for her luncheon. In another, a\nmountain of rosy snow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to\nhave frozen the window also, which it swelled and distorted with its\ncloudy sleet, like a pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung, but\nflakes illumined by a sunrise–the same, doubtless, which purpled the\nreredos of the altar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be\nthrown on it for a moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to\nbe extinguished than painted and permanently fastened on the stone. And\nall of them were so old that you could see, here and there, their silvery\nantiquity sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its\nthreadbare brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass.\nThere was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred\nlittle rectangular windows, of blue principally, like a great game of\npatience of the kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but, either\nbecause a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own\nshifting vision had drawn across the window, whose colours died away and\nwere rekindled by turns, a rare and transient fire–the next instant it\nhad taken on all the iridescence of a peacock’s tail, then shook and\nwavered in a flaming and fantastic shower, distilled and dropping from the\ngroin of the dark and rocky vault down the moist walls, as though it were\nalong the bed of some rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that I was\nfollowing my parents, who marched before me, their prayer-books clasped in\ntheir hands; a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the deep\ntransparence, the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered on some\nenormous breastplate; but beyond which could be distinguished, dearer than\nall such treasures, a fleeting smile from the sun, which could be seen and\nfelt as well here, in the blue and gentle flood in which it washed the\nmasonry, as on the pavement of the Square or the straw of the\nmarket-place; and even on our first Sundays, when we came down before\nEaster, it would console me for the blackness and bareness of the earth\noutside by making burst into blossom, as in some springtime in old history\namong the heirs of Saint Louis, this dazzling and gilded carpet of\nforget-me-nots in glass.",
        "Two tapestries of high warp represented the coronation of Esther (in which\ntradition would have it that the weaver had given to Ahasuerus the\nfeatures of one of the kings of France and to Esther those of a lady of\nGuermantes whose lover he had been); their colours had melted into one\nanother, so as to add expression, relief, light to the pictures. A touch\nof red over the lips of Esther had strayed beyond their outline; the\nyellow on her dress was spread with such unctuous plumpness as to have\nacquired a kind of solidity, and stood boldly out from the receding\natmosphere; while the green of the trees, which was still bright in Silk\nand wool among the lower parts of the panel, but had quite ’gone’ at the\ntop, separated in a paler scheme, above the dark trunks, the yellowing\nupper branches, tanned and half-obliterated by the sharp though sidelong\nrays of an invisible sun. All these things and, still more than these, the\ntreasures which had come to the church from personages who to me were\nalmost legendary figures (such as the golden cross wrought, it was said,\nby Saint Eloi and presented by Dagobert, and the tomb of the sons of Louis\nthe Germanic in porphyry and enamelled copper), because of which I used to\ngo forward into the church when we were making our way to our chairs as\ninto a fairy-haunted valley, where the rustic sees with amazement on a\nrock, a tree, a marsh, the tangible proofs of the little people’s\nsupernatural passage–all these things made of the church for me something\nentirely different from the rest of the town; a building which occupied,\nso to speak, four dimensions of space–the name of the fourth being\nTime–which had sailed the centuries with that old nave, where bay after\nbay, chapel after chapel, seemed to stretch across and hold down and\nconquer not merely a few yards of soil, but each successive epoch from\nwhich the whole building had emerged triumphant, hiding the rugged\nbarbarities of the eleventh century in the thickness of its walls, through\nwhich nothing could be seen of the heavy arches, long stopped and blinded\nwith coarse blocks of ashlar, except where, near the porch, a deep groove\nwas furrowed into one wall by the tower-stair; and even there the\nbarbarity was veiled by the graceful gothic arcade which pressed\ncoquettishly upon it, like a row of grown-up sisters who, to hide him from\nthe eyes of strangers, arrange themselves smilingly in front of a\ncountrified, unmannerly and ill-dressed younger brother; rearing into the\nsky above the Square a tower which had looked down upon Saint Louis, and\nseemed to behold him still; and thrusting down with its crypt into the\nblackness of a Merovingian night, through which, guiding us with groping\nfinger-tips beneath the shadowy vault, ribbed strongly as an immense bat’s\nwing of stone, Théodore or his sister would light up for us with a candle\nthe tomb of Sigebert’s little daughter, in which a deep hole, like the bed\nof a fossil, had been bored, or so it was said, “by a crystal lamp which,\non the night when the Frankish princess was murdered, had left, of its own\naccord, the golden chains by which it was suspended where the apse is\nto-day and with neither the crystal broken nor the light extinguished had\nburied itself in the stone, through which it had gently forced its way.”",
        "And then the apse of Combray: what am I to say of that? It was so coarse,\nso devoid of artistic beauty, even of the religious spirit. From outside,\nsince the street crossing which it commanded was on a lower level, its\ngreat wall was thrust upwards from a basement of unfaced ashlar, jagged\nwith flints, in all of which there was nothing particularly\necclesiastical; the windows seemed to have been pierced at an abnormal\nheight, and its whole appearance was that of a prison wall rather than of\na church. And certainly in later years, were I to recall all the glorious\napses that I had seen, it would never enter my mind to compare with any\none of them the apse of Combray. Only, one day, turning out of a little\nstreet in some country town, I came upon three alley-ways that converged,\nand facing them an old wall, rubbed, worn, crumbling, and unusually high;\nwith windows pierced in it far overhead and the same asymmetrical\nappearance as the apse of Combray. And at that moment I did not say to\nmyself, as at Chartres I might have done or at Rheims, with what strength\nthe religious feeling had been expressed in its construction, but\ninstinctively I exclaimed “The Church!”",
        "The church! A dear, familiar friend; close pressed in the Rue\nSaint-Hilaire, upon which its north door opened, by its two neighbours,\nMme.  Loiseau’s house and the pharmacy of M. Rapin, against which its\nwalls rested without interspace; a simple citizen of Combray, who might\nhave had her number in the street had the streets of Combray borne\nnumbers, and at whose door one felt that the postman ought to stop on his\nmorning rounds, before going into Mme. Loiseau’s and after leaving M.\nRapin’s, there existed, for all that, between the church and everything in\nCombray that was not the church a clear line of demarcation which I have\nnever succeeded in eliminating from my mind. In vain might Mme. Loiseau\ndeck her window-sills with fuchsias, which developed the bad habit of\nletting their branches trail at all times and in all directions, head\ndownwards, and whose flowers had no more important business, when they\nwere big enough to taste the joys of life, than to go and cool their\npurple, congested cheeks against the dark front of the church; to me such\nconduct sanctified the fuchsias not at all; between the flowers and the\nblackened stones towards which they leaned, if my eyes could discern no\ninterval, my mind preserved the impression of an abyss.",
        "From a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of\nSaint-Hilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath\nwhich Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which brought us\ndown from Paris at Easter-time my father caught sight of it, as it slipped\ninto every fold of the sky in turn, its little iron cock veering\ncontinually in all directions, he would say: “Come, get your wraps\ntogether, we are there.” And on one of the longest walks we ever took from\nCombray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on to an\nimmense plain, closed at the horizon by strips of forest over which rose\nand stood alone the fine point of Saint-Hilaire’s steeple, but so\nsharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched on the\nsky by the finger-nail of a painter anxious to give to such a landscape,\nto so pure a piece of ’nature,’ this little sign of art, this single\nindication of human existence. As one drew near it and could make out the\nremains of the square tower, half in ruins, which still stood by its side,\nthough without rivalling it in height, one was struck, first of all, by\nthe tone, reddish and sombre, of its stones; and on a misty morning in\nautumn one would have called it, to see it rising above the violet\nthunder-cloud of the vineyards, a ruin of purple, almost the colour of the\nwild vine.",
        "Often in the Square, as we came home, my grandmother would make me stop to\nlook up at it. From the tower windows, placed two and two, one pair above\nanother, with that right and original proportion in their spacing to which\nnot only human faces owe their beauty and dignity, it released, it let\nfall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little while\nwould wheel and caw, as though the ancient stones which allowed them to\nsport thus and never seemed to see them, becoming of a sudden\nuninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element, had\nstruck them and driven them forth. Then after patterning everywhere the\nviolet velvet of the evening air, abruptly soothed, they would return and\nbe absorbed in the tower, deadly no longer but benignant, some perching\nhere and there (not seeming to move, but snapping, perhaps, and swallowing\nsome passing insect) on the points of turrets, as a seagull perches, with\nan angler’s immobility, on the crest of a wave. Without quite knowing why,\nmy grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that absence of\nvulgarity, pretension, and meanness which made her love–and deem rich in\nbeneficent influences–nature itself, when the hand of man had not, as did\nmy great-aunt’s gardener, trimmed it, and the works of genius. And\ncertainly every part one saw of the church served to distinguish the whole\nfrom any other building by a kind of general feeling which pervaded it,\nbut it was in the steeple that the church seemed to display a\nconsciousness of itself, to affirm its individual and responsible\nexistence.  It was the steeple which spoke for the church. I think, too,\nthat in a confused way my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what\nshe prized above anything else in the world, namely, a natural air and an\nair of distinction. Ignorant of architecture, she would say:",
        "“My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not conventionally beautiful,\nbut there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me. If it\ncould play the piano, I am sure it would really play.” And when she\ngazed on it, when her eyes followed the gentle tension, the fervent\ninclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose, like\nhands joined in prayer, she would absorb herself so utterly in the\noutpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it; her\nlips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old stones\nof which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost pinnacles,\nwhich, at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight and were\nsoftened and sweetened by it, seemed to have mounted suddenly far higher,\nto have become truly remote, like a song whose singer breaks into\nfalsetto, an octave above the accompanying air.",
        "It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and\nconsecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every point of view\nin the town. From my bedroom window I could discern no more than its base,\nwhich had been freshly covered with slates; but when on Sundays I saw\nthese, in the hot light of a summer morning, blaze like a black sun I\nwould say to myself: “Good heavens! nine o’clock! I must get ready for\nmass at once if I am to have time to go in and kiss aunt Léonie first,\"\nand I would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the\nSquare, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind the\nblinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass,\npenetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a handkerchief or\nsomething, of which the draper himself would let her see what he had,\nbowing from the waist: who, having made everything ready for shutting up,\nhad just gone into the back shop to put on his Sunday coat and to wash his\nhands, which it was his habit, every few minutes and even on the saddest\noccasions, to rub one against the other with an air of enterprise,\ncunning, and success.",
        "And again, after mass, when we looked in to tell Théodore to bring a\nlarger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine\nweather to come over from Thiberzy for luncheon, we had in front of us the\nsteeple, which, baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still of ’holy\nbread,’ with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight, pricked its sharp\npoint into the blue sky. And in the evening, as I came in from my walk and\nthought of the approaching moment when I must say good night to my mother\nand see her no more, the steeple was by contrast so kindly, there at the\nclose of day, that I would imagine it as being laid, like a brown velvet\ncushion, against–as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded\nbeneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room for it, and had\ncorrespondingly risen on either side; while the cries of the birds\nwheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate\nits spire still further, and to invest it with some quality beyond the\npower of words.",
        "Even when our errands lay in places behind the church, from which it could\nnot be seen, the view seemed always to have been composed with reference\nto the steeple, which would stand up, now here, now there, among the\nhouses, and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared thus without\nthe church. And, indeed, there are many others which look best when seen\nin this way, and I can call to mind vignettes of housetops with\nsurmounting steeples in quite another category of art than those formed by\nthe dreary streets of Combray. I shall never forget, in a quaint Norman\ntown not far from Balbec, two charming eighteenth-century houses, dear to\nme and venerable for many reasons, between which, when one looks up at\nthem from a fine garden which descends in terraces to the river, the\ngothic spire of a church (itself hidden by the houses) soars into the sky\nwith the effect of crowning and completing their fronts, but in a material\nso different, so precious, so beringed, so rosy, so polished, that it is\nat once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two\npretty pebbles lying side by side, between which it had been washed on the\nbeach, the purple, crinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret\nand gay with glossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of\nthe town, I know a window from which one can see across a first, a second,\nand even a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet\nbell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest ’prints’ which the\natmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact,\nnothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this\nview of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But\nsince into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my memory may\nhave been able to bring to their execution, was it able to contribute an\nelement I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not merely regard a\nthing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without parallel,\nso none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost\nlife as does the memory of those aspects of the steeple of Combray from\nthe streets behind the church. Whether one saw it at five o’clock when\ngoing to call for letters at the post-office, some doors away from one, on\nthe left, raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops;\nor again, when one had to go in and ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, one’s\neyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther,\ndescending slope, and one knew that it would be the second turning after\nthe steeple; or yet again, if pressing further afield one went to the\nstation, one saw it obliquely, shewing in profile fresh angles and\nsurfaces, like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its\nrevolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse, drawn muscularly\ntogether and heightened in perspective, seemed to spring upwards with the\neffort which the steeple made to hurl its spire-point into the heart of\nheaven: it was always to the steeple that one must return, always it which\ndominated everything else, summing up the houses with an unexpected\npinnacle, raised before me like the Finger of God, Whose Body might have\nbeen concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my\nconfounding It, for that reason, with them. And so even to-day in any\nlarge provincial town, or in a quarter of Paris which I do not know well,\nif a passer-by who is ’putting me on the right road’ shews me from afar,\nas a point to aim at, some belfry of a hospital, or a convent steeple\nlifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street\nwhich I am to take, my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to\nthat dear and vanished outline, and the passer-by, should he turn round to\nmake sure that I have not gone astray, would see me, to his astonishment,\noblivious of the walk that I had planned to take or the place where I was\nobliged to call, standing still on the spot, before that steeple, for\nhours on end, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a\ntract of soil reclaimed from the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the\nbuildings rise on it again; and then no doubt, and then more uneasily than\nwhen, just now, I asked him for a direction, I will seek my way again, I\nwill turn a corner... but... the goal is in my heart...",
        "On our way home from mass we would often meet M. Legrandin, who, detained\nin Paris by his professional duties as an engineer, could only (except in\nthe regular holiday seasons) visit his home at Combray between Saturday\nevenings and Monday mornings. He was one of that class of men who, apart\nfrom a scientific career in which they may well have proved brilliantly\nsuccessful, have acquired an entirely different kind of culture, literary\nor artistic, of which they make no use in the specialised work of their\nprofession, but by which their conversation profits. More ’literary’ than\nmany ’men of letters’ (we were not aware at this period that M. Legrandin\nhad a distinct reputation as a writer, and so were greatly astonished to\nfind that a well-known composer had set some verses of his to music),\nendowed with a greater ease in execution than many painters, they imagine\nthat the life they are obliged to lead is not that for which they are\nreally fitted, and they bring to their regular occupations either a\nfantastic indifference or a sustained and lofty application, scornful,\nbitter, and conscientious. Tall, with a good figure, a fine, thoughtful\nface, drooping fair moustaches, a look of disillusionment in his blue\neyes, an almost exaggerated refinement of courtesy; a talker such as we\nhad never heard; he was in the sight of my family, who never ceased to\nquote him as an example, the very pattern of a gentleman, who took life in\nthe noblest and most delicate manner. My grandmother alone found fault\nwith him for speaking a little too well, a little too much like a book,\nfor not using a vocabulary as natural as his loosely knotted Lavallière\nneckties, his short, straight, almost schoolboyish coat. She was\nastonished, too, at the furious invective which he was always launching at\nthe aristocracy, at fashionable life, and ’snobbishness’–\"undoubtedly,\"\nhe would say, “the sin of which Saint Paul is thinking when he speaks of\nthe sin for which there is no forgiveness.”",
        "Worldly ambition was a thing which my grandmother was so little capable of\nfeeling, or indeed of understanding, that it seemed to her futile to apply\nso much heat to its condemnation. Besides, she thought it in not very good\ntaste that M. Legrandin, whose sister was married to a country gentleman\nof Lower Normandy near Balbec, should deliver himself of such violent\nattacks upon the nobles, going so far as to blame the Revolution for not\nhaving guillotined them all.",
        "“Well met, my friends!” he would say as he came towards us. “You are lucky\nto spend so much time here; to-morrow I have to go back to Paris, to\nsqueeze back into my niche.",
        "“Oh, I admit,” he went on, with his own peculiar smile, gently ironical,\ndisillusioned and vague, “I have every useless thing in the world in my\nhouse there. The only thing wanting is the necessary thing, a great patch\nof open sky like this. Always try to keep a patch of sky above your life,\nlittle boy,” he added, turning to me. “You have a soul in you of rare\nquality, an artist’s nature; never let it starve for lack of what it\nneeds.”",
        "When, on our reaching the house, my aunt would send to ask us whether Mme.\nGoupil had indeed arrived late for mass, not one of us could inform her.\nInstead, we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was a painter\nat work in the church copying the window of Gilbert the Bad.  Françoise\nwas at once dispatched to the grocer’s, but returned empty-handed owing to\nthe absence of Théodore, whose dual profession of choirman, with a part in\nthe maintenance of the fabric, and of grocer’s assistant gave him not only\nrelations with all sections of society, but an encyclopaedic knowledge of\ntheir affairs.",
        "“Ah!” my aunt would sigh, “I wish it were time for Eulalie to come.  She\nis really the only person who will be able to tell me.”",
        "Eulalie was a limping, energetic, deaf spinster who had ’retired’ after\nthe death of Mme. de la Bretonnerie, with whom she had been in service\nfrom her childhood, and had then taken a room beside the church, from\nwhich she would incessantly emerge, either to attend some service, or,\nwhen there was no service, to say a prayer by herself or to give Théodore\na hand; the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons like my\naunt Léonie, to whom she would relate everything that had occurred at mass\nor vespers. She was not above adding occasional pocket-money to the little\nincome which was found for her by the family of her old employers by going\nfrom time to time to look after the Curé’s linen, or that of some other\nperson of note in the clerical world of Combray. Above a mantle of black\ncloth she wore a little white coif that seemed almost to attach her to\nsome Order, and an infirmity of the skin had stained part of her cheeks\nand her crooked nose the bright red colour of balsam. Her visits were the\none great distraction in the life of my aunt Léonie, who now saw hardly\nanyone else, except the reverend Curé. My aunt had by degrees erased every\nother visitor’s name from her list, because they all committed the fatal\nerror, in her eyes, of falling into one or other of the two categories of\npeople she most detested. One group, the worse of the two, and the one of\nwhich she rid herself first, consisted of those who advised her not to\ntake so much care of herself, and preached (even if only negatively and\nwith no outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or\ndoubting smile) the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a\ngood red beefsteak would do her more good (her, who had had two dreadful\nsips of Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours!) than all her\nmedicine bottles and her bed. The other category was composed of people\nwho appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought,\nin fact that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those\nwhom she had allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable\nhesitation and at Franchise’s urgent request, and who in the course of\ntheir visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been\ndone them by venturing a timid: “Don’t you think that if you were just to\nstir out a little on really fine days...?” or who, on the other hand, when\nshe said to them: “I am very low, very low; nearing the end, dear\nfriends!” had replied: “Ah, yes, when one has no strength left! Still, you\nmay last a while yet\"; each party alike might be certain that her doors\nwould never open to them again. And if Françoise was amused by the look of\nconsternation on my aunt’s face whenever she saw, from her bed, any of\nthese people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were coming\nto see her, or heard her own door-bell ring, she would laugh far more\nheartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt’s devices (which never failed)\nfor having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture when they had\nto turn back without having seen her; and would be filled with secret\nadmiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these\nother people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them. In\nshort, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to\nsee her must approve of her way of life, commiserate with her in her\nsufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.",
        "In all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in a\nminute: “The end is come at last, my poor Eulalie!”, twenty times Eulalie\nwould retort with: “Knowing your illness as you do, Mme. Octave, you will\nlive to be a hundred, as Mme. Sazerin said to me only yesterday.” For one\nof Eulalie’s most rooted beliefs, and one that the formidable list of\ncorrections which her experience must have compiled was powerless to\neradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat’s name was really Mme. Sazerin.",
        "“I do not ask to live to a hundred,” my aunt would say, for she preferred\nto have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days.",
        "And since, besides this, Eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to\ndistract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place\nregularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent\nthem, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those\ndays in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with, but at\nonce changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if Eulalie\nwere a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the rapture of\nwaiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never cease from\nlooking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms\nin turn. Eulalie’s ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end\nof the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her\nill.  For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing else than\nthis visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended Françoise would\nbecome impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that she might go\nupstairs to ’occupy’ my aunt. But–and this more than ever from the day on\nwhich fine weather definitely set in at Combray–the proud hour °f noon,\ndescending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a\nmoment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown, would long have\nechoed about our table, beside the ’holy bread,’ which too had come in,\nafter church, in its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in\nfront of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day,\nand even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of\neggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance on the\ntable she no longer announced to us, Françoise would add–as the labour of\nfields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the luck of the markets,\nthe kindness of neighbours, and her own genius might provide; and so\neffectively that our bill of fare, like the quatrefoils that were carved\non the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected to some\nextent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life–a brill,\nbecause the fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she\nhad seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with\nmarrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before; a roast\nleg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be\nplenty of time for it to ’settle down’ in the seven hours before dinner;\nspinach, by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to\nget; gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left;\nraspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first to\ncome from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years;\na cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond\ncake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf,\nbecause it was our turn to ’offer’ the holy bread. And when all these had\nbeen eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but dedicated more\nparticularly to my father, who had a fondness for such things, a cream of\nchocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the hand of Françoise, would\nbe laid before us, light and fleeting as an ’occasional piece’ of music,\ninto which she had poured the whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to\npartake of it, saying: “No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,\"\nwould at once have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when\nan artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight and\nmaterial, whereas what is of value is the creator’s intention and his\nsignature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have\nshewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the\n’piece’ was still being played, and under the composer’s-very eyes.",
        "At length my mother would say to me: “Now, don’t stay here all day; you\ncan go up to your room if you are too hot outside, but get a little fresh\nair first; don’t start reading immediately after your food.”",
        "And I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, ornamented\nhere and there, like a gothic font, with a salamander, which modelled upon\na background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender,\nallegorical body; on the bench without a back, in the shade of a\nlilac-tree, in that little corner of the garden which communicated, by a\nservice door, with the Rue du Saint-Esprit, and from whose neglected soil\nrose, in two stages, an outcrop from the house itself and apparently a\nseparate building, my aunt’s back-kitchen. One could see its red-tiled\nfloor gleaming like porphyry.  It seemed not so much the cave of\nFrançoise as a little temple of Venus. It would be overflowing with the\nofferings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come sometimes\nfrom distant villages to dedicate here the first-fruits of their fields.\nAnd its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a dove.",
        "In earlier days I would not have lingered in the sacred grove which\nsurrounded this temple, for, before going upstairs to read, I would steal\ninto the little sitting-room which my uncle Adolphe, a brother of my\ngrandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a\nmajor, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its\nopened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun which\nseldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and yet\nfresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned kind of\nexistence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a\ndisused gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into my uncle\nAdolphe’s room, since he no longer came to Combray on account of a quarrel\nwhich had arisen between him and my family, by my fault, and in the\nfollowing circumstances: Once or twice every month, in Paris, I used to be\nsent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon, wearing a\nplain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a working-jacket of\nstriped linen, purple and white.  He would complain that I had not been to\nsee him for a long time; that he was being neglected; he would offer me a\nmarchpane or a tangerine, and we would cross a room in which no one ever\nsat, whose fire was never lighted, whose walls were picked out with gilded\nmouldings, its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky, and its\nfurniture upholstered in satin, as at my grandparents’, only yellow; then\nwe would enter what he called his ’study,’ a room whose walls were hung\nwith prints which shewed, against a dark background, a plump and rosy\ngoddess driving a car, or standing upon a globe, or wearing a star on her\nbrow; pictures which were popular under the Second Empire because there\nwas thought to be something about them that suggested Pompeii, which were\nthen generally despised, and which now people are beginning to collect\nagain for one single and consistent reason (despite any others which they\nmay advance), namely, that they suggest the Second Empire. And there I\nwould stay with my uncle until his man came, with a message from the\ncoachman, to ask him at what time he would like the carriage. My uncle\nwould then be lost in meditation, while his astonished servant stood\nthere, not daring to disturb him by the least movement, wondering and\nwaiting for his answer, which never varied.  For in the end, after a\nsupreme crisis of hesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words:\n\"A quarter past two,” which the servant would echo with amazement, but\nwithout disputing them: “A quarter past two! Very good, sir... I will go\nand tell him....”",
        "At this date I was a lover of the theatre: a Platonic lover, of necessity,\nsince my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one, and so incorrect was\nthe picture I drew for myself of the pleasures to be enjoyed there that I\nalmost believed that each of the spectators looked, as into a stereoscope,\nupon a stage and scenery which existed for himself alone, though closely\nresembling the thousand other spectacles presented to the rest of the\naudience individually.",
        "Every morning I would hasten to the Moriss column to see what new plays it\nannounced. Nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the dreams\nwith which these announcements filled my mind, dreams which took their\nform from the inevitable associations of the words forming the title of\nthe play, and also from the colour of the bills, still damp and wrinkled\nwith paste, on which those words stood out. Nothing, unless it were such\nstrange titles as the Testament de César Girodot, or Oedipe-Roi,\ninscribed not on the green bills of the Opéra-Comique, but on the\nwine-coloured bills of the Comédie-Française, nothing seemed to me to\ndiffer more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of the Diamants de\nla Couronne than the sleek, mysterious satin of the Domino Noir; and\nsince my parents had told me that, for my first visit to the theatre, I\nshould have to choose between these two pieces, I would study exhaustively\nand in turn the title of one and the title of the other (for those were\nall that I knew of either), attempting to snatch from each a foretaste of\nthe pleasure which it offered me, and to compare this pleasure with that\nlatent in the other title, until in the end I had shewn myself such vivid,\nsuch compelling pictures of, on the one hand, a play of dazzling\narrogance, and on the other a gentle, velvety play, that I was as little\ncapable of deciding which play I should prefer to see as if, at the\ndinner-table, they had obliged me to choose between rice à l’Impératrice\nand the famous cream of chocolate.",
        "All my conversations with my playfellows bore upon actors, whose art,\nalthough as yet I had no experience of it, was the first of all its\nnumberless forms in which Art itself allowed me to anticipate its\nenjoyment. Between one actor’s tricks of intonation and inflection and\nanother’s, the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an\nincalculable importance.  And from what I had been told of them I would\narrange them in the order of their talent in lists which I used to murmur\nto myself all day long: lists which in the end became petrified in my\nbrain and were a source of annoyance to it, being irremovable.",
        "And later, in my schooldays, whenever I ventured in class, when the\nmaster’s head was turned, to communicate with some new friend, I would\nalways begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres, and\nif he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly Got, our second\nDelaunay, and so on. And if, in his judgment, Febvre came below Thiron, or\nDelaunay below Coquelin, the sudden volatility which the name of Coquelin,\nforsaking its stony rigidity, would engender in my mind, in which it moved\nupwards to the second place, the rich vitality with which the name of\nDelaunay would suddenly be furnished, to enable it to slip down to fourth,\nwould stimulate and fertilise my brain with a sense of bradding and\nblossoming life.",
        "But if the thought of actors weighed so upon me, if the sight of Maubant,\ncoming out one afternoon from the Théâtre-Français, had plunged me in the\nthroes and sufferings of hopeless love, how much more did the name of a\n’star,’ blazing outside the doors of a theatre, how much more, seen\nthrough the window of a brougham which passed me in the street, the hair\nover her forehead abloom with roses, did the face of a woman who, I would\nthink, was perhaps an actress, leave with me a lasting disturbance, a\nfutile and painful effort to form a picture of her private life.",
        "I classified, in order of talent, the most distinguished: Sarah Bernhardt,\nBerma, Bartet, Madeleine Brohan, Jeanne Samary; but I was interested in\nthem all. Now my uncle knew many of them personally, and also ladies of\nanother class, not clearly distinguished from actresses in my mind. He\nused to entertain them at his house. And if we went to see him on certain\ndays only, that was because on the other days ladies might come whom his\nfamily could not very well have met. So we at least thought; as for my\nuncle, his fatal readiness to pay pretty widows (who had perhaps never\nbeen married) and countesses (whose high-sounding titles were probably no\nmore than noms de guerre) the compliment of presenting them to my\ngrandmother or even of presenting to them some of our family jewels, had\nalready embroiled him more than once with my grandfather. Often, if the\nname of some actress were mentioned in conversation, I would hear my\nfather say, with a smile, to my mother: “One of your uncle’s friends,” and\nI would think of the weary novitiate through which, perhaps for years on\nend, a grown man, even a man of real importance, might have to pass,\nwaiting on the doorstep of some such lady, while she refused to answer his\nletters and made her hall-porter drive him away; and imagine that my uncle\nwas able to dispense a little jackanapes like myself from all these\nsufferings by introducing me in his own home to the actress,\nunapproachable by all the world, but for him an intimate friend.",
        "And so–on the pretext that some lesson, the hour of which had been\naltered, now came at such an awkward time that it had already more than\nonce prevented me, and would continue to prevent me, from seeing my\nuncle–one day, not one of the days which he set apart for our visits, I\ntook advantage of the fact that my parents had had luncheon earlier than\nusual; I slipped out and, instead of going to read the playbills on their\ncolumn, for which purpose I was allowed to go out unaccompanied, I ran all\nthe way to his house. I noticed before his door a carriage and pair, with\nred carnations on the horses’ blinkers and in the coachman’s buttonhole.\nAs I climbed the staircase I could hear laughter and a woman’s voice, and,\nas soon as I had rung, silence and the sound of shutting doors.  The\nman-servant who let me in appeared embarrassed, and said that my uncle was\nextremely busy and probably could not see me; he went in, however, to\nannounce my arrival, and the same voice I had heard before said: “Oh, yes!\nDo let him come in; just for a moment; it will be so amusing.  Is that his\nphotograph there, on your desk? And his mother (your niece, isn’t she?)\nbeside it? The image of her, isn’t he? I should so like to see the little\nchap, just for a second.”",
        "I could hear my uncle grumbling and growing angry; finally the manservant\ntold me to come in.",
        "On the table was the same plate of marchpanes that was always there; my\nuncle wore the same alpaca coat as on other days; but opposite to him, in\na pink silk dress with a great necklace of pearls about her throat, sat a\nyoung woman who was just finishing a tangerine. My uncertainty whether I\nought to address her as Madame or Mademoiselle made me blush, and not\ndaring to look too much in her direction, in case I should be obliged to\nspeak to her, I hurried across to kiss my uncle. She looked at me and\nsmiled; my uncle said “My nephew!” without telling her my name or telling\nme hers, doubtless because, since his difficulties with my grandfather, he\nhad endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any association of his family\nwith this other class of acquaintance.",
        "“How like his mother he is,” said the lady.",
        "“But you have never seen my niece, except in photographs,” my uncle broke\nin quickly, with a note of anger.",
        "“I beg your pardon, dear friend, I passed her on the staircase last year\nwhen you were so ill. It is true I only saw her for a moment, and your\nstaircase is rather dark; but I saw well enough to see how lovely she was.\nThis young gentleman has her beautiful eyes, and also this,” she went on,\ntracing a line with one finger across the lower part of her forehead.\n\"Tell me,” she asked my uncle, “is your niece Mme.––; is her name the\nsame as yours?”",
        "“He takes most after his father,” muttered my uncle, who was no more\nanxious to effect an introduction by proxy, in repeating Mamma’s name\naloud, than to bring the two together in the flesh. “He’s his father all\nover, and also like my poor mother.”",
        "“I have not met his father, dear,” said the lady in pink, bowing her head\nslightly, “and I never saw your poor mother. You will remember it was just\nafter your great sorrow that we got to know one another.”",
        "I felt somewhat disillusioned, for this young lady was in no way different\nfrom other pretty women whom I had seen from time to time at home,\nespecially the daughter of one of our cousins, to whose house I went every\nNew Year’s Day. Only better dressed; otherwise my uncle’s friend had the\nsame quick and kindly glance, the same frank and friendly manner.  I could\nfind no trace in her of the theatrical appearance which I admired in\nphotographs of actresses, nothing of the diabolical expression which would\nhave been in keeping with the life she must lead. I had difficulty in\nbelieving that this was one of ’those women,’ and certainly I should never\nhave believed her one of the ’smart ones’ had I not seen the carriage and\npair, the pink dress, the pearly necklace, had I not been aware, too, that\nmy uncle knew only the very best of them. But I asked myself how the\nmillionaire who gave her her carriage and her flat and her jewels could\nfind any pleasure in flinging his money away upon a woman who had so\nsimple and respectable an appearance. And yet, when I thought of what her\nlife must be like, its immorality disturbed me more, perhaps, than if it\nhad stood before me in some concrete and recognisable form, by its secrecy\nand invisibility, like the plot of a novel, the hidden truth of a scandal\nwhich had driven out of the home of her middle-class parents and dedicated\nto the service of all mankind which had brought to the flowering-point of\nher beauty, had raised to fame or notoriety this woman, the play of whose\nfeatures, the intonations of whose voice, like so many others I already\nknew, made me regard her, in spite of myself, as a young lady of good\nfamily, her who was no longer of a family at all.",
        "We had gone by this time into the ’study,’ and my uncle, who seemed a\ntrifle embarrassed by my presence, offered her a cigarette.",
        "“No, thank you, dear friend,” she said. “You know I only smoke the ones\nthe Grand Duke sends me. I tell him that they make you jealous.” And she\ndrew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold, in a\nforeign language. “Why, yes,” she began again suddenly. “Of course I have\nmet this young man’s father with you. Isn’t he your nephew? How on earth\ncould I have forgotten? He was so nice, so charming to me,” she went on,\nmodestly and with feeling. But when I thought to myself what must actually\nhave been the rude greeting (which, she made out, had been so charming),\nI, who knew my father’s coldness and reserve, was shocked, as though at\nsome indelicacy on his part, at the contrast between the excessive\nrecognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality.  It has since\nstruck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part played in life\nby these idle, painstaking women that they devote all their generosity,\nall their talent, their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty (for,\nlike all artists, they never seek to realise the value of those dreams, or\nto enclose them in the four-square frame of everyday life), and their\ngold, which counts for little, to the fashioning of a fine and precious\nsetting for the rubbed and scratched and ill-polished lives of men. And\njust as this one filled the smoking-room, where my uncle was entertaining\nher in his alpaca coat, with her charming person, her dress of pink silk,\nher pearls, and the refinement suggested by intimacy with a Grand Duke,\nso, in the same way, she had taken some casual remark by my father, had\nworked it up delicately, given it a ’turn,’ a precious title, set in it\nthe gem of a glance from her own eyes, a gem of the first water, blended\nof humility and gratitude; and so had given it back transformed into a\njewel, a work of art, into something altogether charming.",
        "“Look here, my boy, it is time you went away,” said my uncle.",
        "I rose; I could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady in\npink, but I felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a\nforcible abduction of her. My heart beat loud while I counted out to\nmyself “Shall I do it, shall I not?” and then I ceased to ask myself what\nI ought to do so as at least to do something. Blindly, hotly, madly,\nflinging aside all the reasons I had just found to support such action, I\nseized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me.",
        "“Isn’t he delicious! Quite a ladies’ man already; he takes after his\nuncle.  He’ll be a perfect ’gentleman,’” she went on, setting her teeth so\nas to give the word a kind of English accentuation. “Couldn’t he come to\nme some day for ’a cup of tea,’ as our friends across the channel say; he\nneed only send me a ’blue’ in the morning?”",
        "I had not the least idea of what a ’blue’ might be. I did not understand\nhalf the words which the lady used, but my fear lest there should be\nconcealed in them some question which it would be impolite in me not to\nanswer kept me from withdrawing my close attention from them, and I was\nbeginning to feel extremely tired.",
        "“No, no; it is impossible,” said my uncle, shrugging his shoulders. “He is\nkept busy at home all day; he has plenty of work to do. He brings back all\nthe prizes from his school,” he added in a lower tone, so that I should\nnot hear this falsehood and interrupt with a contradiction. “You can’t\ntell; he may turn out a little Victor Hugo, a kind of Vaulabelle, don’t\nyou know.”",
        "“Oh, I love artistic people,” replied the lady in pink; “there is no one\nlike them for understanding women. Them, and really nice men like\nyourself.  But please forgive my ignorance. Who, what is Vaulabelle? Is it\nthose gilt books in the little glass case in your drawing-room? You know\nyou promised to lend them to me; I will take great care of them.”",
        "My uncle, who hated lending people books, said nothing, and ushered me out\ninto the hall. Madly in love with the lady in pink, I covered my old\nuncle’s tobacco-stained cheeks with passionate kisses, and while he,\nawkwardly enough, gave me to understand (without actually saying) that he\nwould rather I did not tell my parents about this visit, I assured him,\nwith tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an impression\nupon me that some day I would most certainly find a way of expressing my\ngratitude. So strong an impression had it made upon me that two hours\nlater, after a string of mysterious utterances which did not strike me as\ngiving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new importance with\nwhich I had been invested, I found it simpler to let them have a full\naccount, omitting no detail, of the visit I had paid that afternoon. In\ndoing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness. How\ncould I have thought such a thing, since I did not wish it? And I could\nnot suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which I\nmyself saw none. Every day of our lives does not some friend or other ask\nus to make his apologies, without fail, to some woman to whom he has been\nprevented from writing; and do not we forget to do so, feeling that this\nwoman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for\nourselves? I imagined, like everyone else, that the brains of other people\nwere lifeless and submissive receptacles with no power of specific\nreaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them; and I had not the\nleast doubt that when I deposited in the minds of my parents the news of\nthe acquaintance I had made at my uncle’s I should at the same time\ntransmit to them the kindly judgment I myself had based on the\nintroduction. Unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely\ndifferent from those which I suggested they should adopt when they came to\nform their estimate of my uncle’s conduct. My father and grandfather had\n’words’ with him of a violent order; as I learned indirectly. A few days\nlater, passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage,\nÎ felt at once all the grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should\nhave liked to convey to him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I\nconsidered that merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and\npetty, and might make him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew\nhim no more than the commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from\nso inadequate a gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that,\nin doing so I was obeying my parents’ orders; he never forgave them; and\nthough he did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes\non him again.",
        "And so I no longer used to go into the little sitting-room (now kept shut)\nof my uncle Adolphe; instead, after hanging about on the outskirts of the\nback-kitchen until Françoise appeared on its threshold and announced: “I\nam going to let the kitchen-maid serve the coffee and take up the hot\nwater; it is time I went off to Mme. Octave,” I would then decide to go\nindoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read.  The\nkitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution to which\nan invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity\nand identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in\nwhich that personality was incarnate; for we never found the same girl\nthere two years running. In the year in which we ate such quantities of\nasparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor\nsickly creature, some way ’gone’ in pregnancy when we arrived at Combray\nfor Easter, and it was indeed surprising that Françoise allowed her to run\nso many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house, for she\nwas beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious\ncasket, fuller and larger every day, whose splendid outline could be\ndetected through the folds of her ample smocks. These last recalled the\ncloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his\npaintings, of which M. Swann had given me photographs. He it was who\npointed out the resemblance, and when he inquired after the kitchen-maid\nhe would say: “Well, how goes it with Giotto’s Charity?” And indeed the\npoor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her,\neven to her face, and the vertical, squared outlines of her cheeks, did\ndistinctly suggest those virgins, so strong and mannish as to seem matrons\nrather, in whom the Virtues are personified in the Arena Chapel. And I can\nsee now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua resembled her in another\nrespect as well. For just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by\nthe additional symbol which she carried in her body, without appearing to\nunderstand what it meant, without any rendering in her facial expression\nof all its beauty and spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an\nordinary and rather heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion\nof what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed\nin the Arena beneath the label ’Caritas,’ and a reproduction of whose\nportrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that\nvirtue, for it seems impossible, that any thought of charity can ever have\nfound expression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the\npainter’s invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her\nfeet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to\nextract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of\nsacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart to\nGod, or shall we say ’handing’ it to Him, exactly as a cook might hand up\na corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one\nwho had called down to ask her for it from the ground-level above. The\n’Invidia,’ again, should have had some look on her face of envy. But in\nthis fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented\nwith such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips of Envy is so\nhuge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that the muscles of\nher face are strained and contorted, like a child’s who is filling a\nballoon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves for that matter,\nwhen we look at her, since all her attention and ours are concentrated on\nthe action of her lips, have no time, almost, to spare for envious\nthoughts.",
        "Despite all the admiration that M. Swann might profess for these figures\nof Giotto, it was a long time before I could find any pleasure in seeing\nin our schoolroom (where the copies he had brought me were hung) that\nCharity devoid of charity, that Envy who looked like nothing so much as a\nplate in some medical book, illustrating the compression of the glottis or\nuvula by a tumour in the tongue, or by the introduction of the operator’s\ninstrument, a Justice whose greyish and meanly regular features were the\nvery same as those which adorned the faces of certain good and pious and\nslightly withered ladies of Combray whom I used to see at mass, many of\nwhom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces of Injustice. But in\nlater years I understood that the arresting strangeness, the special\nbeauty of these frescoes lay in the great part played in each of them by\nits symbols, while the fact that these were depicted, not as symbols (for\nthe thought symbolised was nowhere expressed), but as real things,\nactually felt or materially handled, added something more precise and more\nliteral to their meaning, something more concrete and more striking to the\nlesson they imparted. And even in the case of the poor kitchen-maid, was\nnot our attention incessantly drawn to her belly by the load which filled\nit; and in the same way, again, are not the thoughts of men and women in\nthe agony of death often turned towards the practical, painful, obscure,\ninternal, intestinal aspect, towards that ’seamy side’ of death which is,\nas it happens, the side that death actually presents to them and forces\nthem to feel, a side which far more closely resembles a crushing burden, a\ndifficulty in breathing, a destroying thirst, than the abstract idea to\nwhich we are accustomed to give the name of Death?",
        "There must have been a strong element of reality in those Virtues and\nVices of Padua, since they appeared to me to be as much alive as the\npregnant servant-girl, while she herself appeared scarcely less\nallegorical than they. And, quite possibly, this lack (or seeming lack) of\nparticipation by a person’s soul in the significant marks of its own\nspecial virtue has, apart from its aesthetic meaning, a reality which, if\nnot strictly psychological, may at least be called physiognomical. Later\non, when, in the course of my life, I have had occasion to meet with, in\nconvents for instance, literally saintly examples of practical charity,\nthey have generally had the brisk, decided, undisturbed, and slightly\nbrutal air of a busy surgeon, the face in which one can discern no\ncommiseration, no tenderness at the sight of suffering humanity, and no\nfear of hurting it, the face devoid of gentleness or sympathy, the sublime\nface of true goodness.",
        "Then while the kitchen-maid–who, all unawares, made the superior\nqualities of Françoise shine with added lustre, just as Error, by force of\ncontrast, enhances the triumph of Truth–took in coffee which (according\nto Mamma) was nothing more than hot water, and then carried up to our\nrooms hot water which was barely tepid, I would be lying stretched out on\nmy bed, a book in my hand, in my room which trembled with the effort to\ndefend its frail, transparent coolness against the afternoon sun, behind\nits almost closed shutters through which, however, a reflection of the\nsunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden wings, remaining\nmotionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner, like a butterfly\npoised upon a flower. It was hardly light enough for me to read, and my\nfeeling of the day’s brightness and splendour was derived solely from the\nblows struck down below, in the Rue de la Curé, by Camus (whom Françoise\nhad assured that my aunt was not ’resting’ and that he might therefore\nmake a noise), upon some old packing-cases from which nothing would really\nbe sent flying but the dust, though the din of them, in the resonant\natmosphere that accompanies hot weather, seemed to scatter broadcast a\nrain of blood-red stars; and from the flies who performed for my benefit,\nin their small concert, as it might be the chamber music of summer;\nevoking heat and light quite differently from an air of human music which,\nif you happen to have heard it during a fine summer, will always bring\nthat summer back to your mind, the flies’ music is bound to the season by\na closer, a more vital tie–born of sunny days, and not to be reborn but\nwith them, containing something of their essential nature, it not merely\ncalls up their image in our memory, but gives us a guarantee that they do\nreally exist, that they are close around us, immediately accessible.",
        "This dim freshness of my room was to the broad daylight of the street what\nthe shadow is to the sunbeam, that is to say, equally luminous, and\npresented to my imagination the entire panorama of summer, which my\nsenses, if I had been out walking, could have tasted and enjoyed in\nfragments only; and so was quite in harmony with my state of repose, which\n(thanks to the adventures related in my books, which had just excited it)\nbore, like a hand reposing motionless in a stream of running water, the\nshock and animation of a torrent of activity and life.",
        "But my grandmother, even if the weather, after growing too hot, had\nbroken, and a storm, or just a shower, had burst over us, would come up\nand beg me to go outside. And as I did not wish to leave off my book, I\nwould go on with it in the garden, under the chestnut-tree, in a little\nsentry-box of canvas and matting, in the farthest recesses of which I used\nto sit and feel that I was hidden from the eyes of anyone who might be\ncoming to call upon the family.",
        "And then my thoughts, did not they form a similar sort of hiding-hole, in\nthe depths of which I felt that I could bury myself and remain invisible\neven when I was looking at what went on outside? When I saw any external\nobject, my consciousness that I was seeing it would remain between me and\nit, enclosing it in a slender, incorporeal outline which prevented me from\never coming directly in contact with the material form; for it would\nvolatilise itself in some way before I could touch it, just as an\nincandescent body which is moved towards something wet never actually\ntouches moisture, since it is always preceded, itself, by a zone of\nevaporation. Upon the sort of screen, patterned with different states and\nimpressions, which my consciousness would quietly unfold while I was\nreading, and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations of my\nheart to the wholly external view of the horizon spread out before my eyes\nat the foot of the garden, what was from the first the most permanent and\nthe most intimate part of me, the lever whose incessant movements\ncontrolled all the rest, was my belief in the philosophic richness and\nbeauty of the book I was reading, and my desire to appropriate these to\nmyself, whatever the book might be. For even if I had purchased it at\nCombray, having seen it outside Borange’s, whose grocery lay too far from\nour house for Françoise to be able to deal there, as she did with Camus,\nbut who enjoyed better custom as a stationer and bookseller; even if I had\nseen it, tied with string to keep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly\nparts and pamphlets which adorned either side of his doorway, a doorway\nmore mysterious, more teeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral, I\nshould have noticed and bought it there simply because I had recognised it\nas a book which had been well spoken of, in my hearing, by the\nschool-master or the school-friend who, at that particular time, seemed to\nme to be entrusted with the secret of Truth and Beauty, things half-felt\nby me, half-incomprehensible, the full understanding of which was the\nvague but permanent object of my thoughts.",
        "Next to this central belief, which, while I was reading, would be\nconstantly a motion from my inner self to the outer world, towards the\ndiscovery of Truth, came the emotions aroused in me by the action in which\nI would be taking part, for these afternoons were crammed with more\ndramatic and sensational events than occur, often, in a whole lifetime.\nThese were the events which took place in the book I was reading. It is\ntrue that the people concerned in them were not what Françoise would have\ncalled ’real people.’ But none of the feelings which the joys or\nmisfortunes of a ’real’ person awaken in us can be awakened except through\na mental picture of those joys or misfortunes; and the ingenuity of the\nfirst novelist lay in his understanding that, as the picture was the one\nessential element in the complicated structure of our emotions, so that\nsimplification of it which consisted in the suppression, pure and simple,\nof ’real’ people would be a decided improvement. A ’real’ person,\nprofoundly as we may sympathise with him, is in a great measure\nperceptible only through our senses, that is to say, he remains opaque,\noffers a dead weight which our sensibilities have not the strength to\nlift. If some misfortune comes to him, it is only in one small section of\nthe complete idea we have of him that we are capable of feeling any\nemotion; indeed it is only in one small section of the complete idea he\nhas of himself that he is capable of feeling any emotion either. The\nnovelist’s happy discovery was to think of substituting for those opaque\nsections, impenetrable by the human spirit, their equivalent in immaterial\nsections, things, that is, which the spirit can assimilate to itself.\nAfter which it matters not that the actions, the feelings of this new\norder of creatures appear to us in the guise of truth, since we have made\nthem our own, since it is in ourselves that they are happening, that they\nare holding in thrall, while we turn over, feverishly, the pages of the\nbook, our quickened breath and staring eyes. And once the novelist has\nbrought us to that state, in which, as in all purely mental states, every\nemotion is multiplied ten-fold, into which his book comes to disturb us as\nmight a dream, but a dream more lucid, and of a more lasting impression\nthan those which come to us in sleep; why, then, for the space of an hour\nhe sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world, a few of\nwhich, only, we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting\nto know, and the keenest, the most intense of which would never have been\nrevealed to us because the slow course of their development stops our\nperception of them. It is the same in life; the heart changes, and that is\nour worst misfortune; but we learn of it only from reading or by\nimagination; for in reality its alteration, like that of certain natural\nphenomena, is so gradual that, even if we are able to distinguish,\nsuccessively, each of its different states, we are still spared the actual\nsensation of change.",
        "Next to, but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human\nelement, would come the view, more or less projected before my eyes, of\nthe country in which the action of the story was taking place, which made\na far stronger impression on my mind than the other, the actual landscape\nwhich would meet my eyes when I raised them from my book. In this way, for\ntwo consecutive summers I used to sit in the heat of our Combray garden,\nsick with a longing inspired by the book I was then reading for a land of\nmountains and rivers, where I could see an endless vista of sawmills,\nwhere beneath the limpid currents fragments of wood lay mouldering in beds\nof watercress; and nearby, rambling and clustering along low walls, purple\nflowers and red. And since there was always lurking in my mind the dream\nof a woman who would enrich me with her love, that dream in those two\nsummers used to be quickened with the freshness and coolness of running\nwater; and whoever she might be, the woman whose image I called to mind,\npurple flowers and red would at once spring up on either side of her like\ncomplementary colours.",
        "This was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever\ndistinguished, is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not\nits own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture; for the\nscenes in the books I read were to me not merely scenery more vividly\nportrayed by my imagination than any which Combray could spread before my\neyes but otherwise of the same kind. Because of the selection that the\nauthor had made of them, because of the spirit of faith in which my mind\nwould exceed and anticipate his printed word, as it might be interpreting\na revelation, these scenes used to give me the impression–one which I\nhardly ever derived from any place in which I might happen to be, and\nnever from our garden, that undistinguished product of the strictly\nconventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised–of\ntheir being actually part of Nature herself, and worthy to be studied and\nexplored.",
        "Had my parents allowed me, when I read a book, to pay a visit to the\ncountry it described, I should have felt that I was making an enormous\nadvance towards the ultimate conquest of truth. For even if we have the\nsensation of being always enveloped in, surrounded by our own soul, still\nit does not seem a fixed and immovable prison; rather do we seem to be\nborne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it, to break\nout into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly,\nall around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from without, but the\nresonance of a vibration from within. We try to discover in things,\nendeared to us on that account, the spiritual glamour which we ourselves\nhave cast upon them; we are disillusioned, and learn that they are in\nthemselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds,\nto the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilise all our\nspiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence and subjugate\nother human beings who, as we very well know, are situated outside\nourselves, where we can never reach them. And so, if I always imagined the\nwoman I loved as in a setting of whatever places I most longed, at the\ntime, to visit; if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to\nthem, who opened to me the gate of an unknown world, that was not by the\nmere hazard of a simple association of thoughts; no, it was because my\ndreams of travel and of love were only moments–which I isolate\nartificially to-day as though I were cutting sections, at different\nheights, in a jet of water, rainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or\nmotion–were only drops in a single, undeviating, irresistible outrush of\nall the forces of my life.",
        "And then, as I continue to trace the outward course of these impressions\nfrom their close-packed intimate source in my consciousness, and before I\ncome to the horizon of reality which envelops them, I discover pleasures\nof another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting the good\nscent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and, when an hour\nchimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what was already\nspent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the last stroke\nwhich enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the silence that\nfollowed seemed to herald the beginning, in the blue sky above me, of that\nlong part of the day still allowed me for reading, until the good dinner\nwhich Françoise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and\nrefresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my\nbook. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to me that a few seconds\nonly had passed since the hour before; the latest would inscribe itself,\nclose to its predecessor, on the sky’s surface, and I would be unable to\nbelieve that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue\nwhich was comprised between their two golden figures. Sometimes it would\neven happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than\nthe last; there must then have been an hour which I had not heard strike;\nsomething which had taken place had not taken place for me; the\nfascination of my book, a magic as potent as the deepest slumber, had\nstopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden\nbell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence. Sweet Sunday\nafternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our Combray garden, from which I\nwas careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life,\nreplacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land\nwatered by living streams, you still recall those adventures and ambitions\nto my mind when I think of you, and you embody and preserve them by virtue\nof having little by little drawn round and enclosed them (while I went on\nwith my book and the heat of the day declined) in the gradual\ncrystallisation, slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of\nchestnut-leaves, of your silent, sonorous, fragrant, limpid hours.",
        "Sometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon, by\nthe gardener’s daughter, who came running like a mad thing, overturning an\norange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth, and screaming\nout “They’re coming, they’re coming!” so that Françoise and I should run\ntoo and not miss anything of the show. That was on days when the cavalry\nstationed in Combray went out for some military exercise, going as a rule\nby the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on\ntheir chairs outside the garden railings, stared at the people of Combray\ntaking their Sunday walks and were stared at in return, the gardener’s\ndaughter, through the gap which there was between two houses far away in\nthe Avenue de la Gare, would have spied the glitter of helmets. The\nservants then hurried in with their chairs, for when the troopers filed\nthrough the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and\ntheir jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering\nand drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel\nto a river in flood.",
        "“Poor children,” Françoise would exclaim, in tears almost before she had\nreached the railings; “poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a meadow.\nIt’s just shocking to think of,” she would go on, laying a hand over her\nheart, where presumably she had felt the shock.",
        "“A fine sight, isn’t it, Mme. Françoise, all these young fellows not\ncaring two straws for their lives?” the gardener would ask, just to ’draw’\nher. And he would not have spoken in vain.",
        "“Not caring for their lives, is it? Why, what in the world is there that\nwe should care for if it’s not our lives, the only gift the Lord never\noffers us a second time? Oh dear, oh dear; you’re right all the same; it’s\nquite true, they don’t care! I can remember them in ’70; in those wretched\nwars they’ve no fear of death left in them; they’re nothing more nor less\nthan madmen; and then they aren’t worth the price of a rope to hang them\nwith; they’re not men any more, they’re lions.” For by her way of\nthinking, to compare a man with a lion, which she used to pronounce\n’lie-on,’ was not at all complimentary to the man.",
        "The Rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see\npeople approaching at any distance, and it was only through the gap\nbetween those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still make\nout fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the sunlight.\nThe gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come, and he\nwas thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his head. So then,\nsuddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from a beleaguered city,\nwould make a sortie, turn the street corner, and, having risked her life a\nhundred times over, reappear and bring us, with a jug of liquorice-water,\nthe news that there were still at least a thousand of them, pouring along\nwithout a break from the direction of Thiberzy and Méséglise. Françoise\nand the gardener, having ’made up’ their difference, would discuss the\nline to be followed in case of war.",
        "“Don’t you see, Françoise,” he would say. “Revolution would be better,\nbecause then no one would need to join in unless he liked.”",
        "“Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it’s more straightforward.”",
        "The gardener believed that, as soon as war was declared, they would stop\nall the railways.",
        "“Yes, to be sure; so that we sha’n’t get away,” said Françoise.",
        "And the gardener would assent, with “Ay, they’re the cunning ones,” for he\nwould not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state\nattempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the world who\nwould not run away from it if he had the chance to do so.",
        "But Françoise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my book,\nand the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch\nthe dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the passage\nof the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored, an abnormal\ntide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of Corn-bray.  And\nin front of every house, even of those where it was not, as a rule,\n’done,’ the servants, and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare,\nfestooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe, like the border\nof shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the\nbeach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when the sea itself\nhas retreated.",
        "Except on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read\nin peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and the\ncommentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading, which had\nbrought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called Bergotte, had\nthis definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a\nwall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a wholly different\nbackground, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I would see outlined the\nfigure of one of the women of whom I dreamed.",
        "I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older than\nmyself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name\nof Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the Nuit d’Octobre, he had burst\nout in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of\nwarning: “You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He\nis a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable specimen. I am\nbound to admit, natheless,” he added graciously, “that he, and even the\nman Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is\nnot only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme\nmerit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is",
        "    La blanche Oloossone et la blanche Camire,",
        "and the other",
        "    La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaë.”",
        "They were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the two\nrunagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who is\nfound pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is\na book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended,\nit would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so they tell me,\nits author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle,\nindeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a\ncritical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering fools, for which it is\nimpossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has\nweight with me as it were the Delphic Oracle. Read you then this lyrical\nprose, and, if the Titanic master-builder of rhythm who composed\nBhagavat and the Lévrier de Magnus speaks not falsely, then, by\nApollo, you may taste, even you, my master, the ambrosial joys of\nOlympus.” It was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to\ncall him, and that he himself called me, “my master.” But, as a matter of\nfact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism,\nbeing still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real\nexistence by giving it a name.",
        "Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with Bloch,\nin which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts he had\nengendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from which I,\nif you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself)\nwere all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For, as it happened,\nBloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he had been well\nreceived there. It is true that my grandfather made out that, whenever I\nformed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home\nwith me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he would not have\nobjected on principle–indeed his own friend Swann was of Jewish\nextraction–had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as friends were\nnot usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able to bring a new\nfriend home without my grandfather’s humming the “O, God of our fathers\"\nfrom La Juive, or else “Israel, break thy chain,” singing the tune\nalone, of course, to an “um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la\"; but I used to be\nafraid of my friend’s recognising the sound, and so being able to\nreconstruct the words.",
        "Before seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often\nas not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only\nthe Jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen\npeople, but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family.",
        "“And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?”",
        "“Dumont, grandpapa.”",
        "“Dumont! Oh, I’m frightened of Dumont.”",
        "And he would sing:",
        "  Archers, be on your guard!\n  Watch without rest, without sound,",
        "and then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would call\nout “On guard! on guard,” or, if it were the victim himself who had\nalready arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my grandfather’s\nsubtle examination, to admit his origin, then my grandfather, to shew us\nthat he had no longer any doubts, would merely look at us, humming almost\ninaudibly the air of",
        "  What! do you hither guide the feet\n  Of this timid Israelite?",
        "or of",
        "  Sweet vale of Hebron, dear paternal fields,",
        "or, perhaps, of",
        "  Yes, I am of the chosen race.",
        "These little eccentricities on my grandfather’s part implied no ill-will\nwhatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for\nother reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come in\nwith wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:",
        "“Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining?  I\ncan’t understand it; the barometer has been ’set fair.’”",
        "Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than “Sir, I am absolutely\nincapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart\nfrom physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me\nof them.”",
        "“My poor boy,” said my father after Bloch had gone, “your friend is out of\nhis mind. Why, he couldn’t even tell me what the weather was like.  As if\nthere could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.”",
        "Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when\nshe complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped\nthe tears from his eyes.",
        "“You cannot imagine that he is sincere,” she observed to me. “Why he\ndoesn’t know me. Unless he’s mad, of course.”",
        "And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a\nhalf late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and made\nnot the least apology, saying merely: “I never allow myself to be\ninfluenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by\nthe arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly\nreintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but I\nam wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more\npernicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the\numbrella and the watch.”",
        "In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He was,\nof course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me; they\nhad, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my\ngrandmother’s illness were genuine enough; but they knew, either\ninstinctively or from their own experience, that our early impulsive\nemotions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct\nof our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty to our\nfriends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule of life, have\na surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in\nthese momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They would have preferred\nto Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would have given me no more\nthan it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class morality, for boys to\ngive one another, who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit\nbecause they happened, that morning, to have thought of me with affection,\nbut who, since they were incapable of inclining in my favour, by any\nsingle impulse of their imagination and emotions, the exact balance of the\nduties and claims of friendship, were as incapable of loading the scales\nto my prejudice. Even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from\nthe path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my\ngreat-aunt furnished a type: who, after quarrelling for years with a\nniece, to whom she never spoke again, yet made no change in the will in\nwhich she had left that niece the whole of her fortune, because she was\nher next-of-kin, and it was the ’proper thing’ to do.",
        "But I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the\ninsoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the ’absolutely\nmeaningless’ beauty of La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaë tired me more\nand made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with\nhim, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother’s mind. And he\nwould still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same\nnight, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a great\ninfluence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then more\nunhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that there\nwas not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome, he had gone\non to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that\nmy great-aunt herself had led a ’gay’ life in her younger days, and had\nbeen notoriously ’kept.’ I could not refrain from passing on so important\na piece of information to my parents; the next time Bloch called he was\nnot admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the street, he greeted me\nwith extreme coldness.",
        "But in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly.",
        "For the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one’s head\nand maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment\n’got hold,’ the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte’s style\nhad not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel of\nhis which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the story\nalone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet a woman\nat some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that\nwe are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic phrases which\nhe liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow of harmony, a\nprelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and\nelevate his style; and it was at such points as these, too, that he would\nbegin to speak of the “vain dream of life,” of the “inexhaustible torrent\nof fair forms,” of the “sterile, splendid torture of understanding and\nloving,” of the “moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming\nand venerable fronts of our cathedrals\"; that he would express a whole\nsystem of philosophy, new to me, by the use of marvellous imagery, to the\ninspiration of which I would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping\nwhich began to chime and echo in my ears, an accompaniment to which that\nimagery added something ethereal and sublime. One of these passages of\nBergotte, the third or fourth which I had detached from the rest, filled\nme with a joy to which the meagre joy I had tasted in the first passage\nbore no comparison, a joy which I felt myself to have experienced in some\ninnermost chamber of my soul, deep, undivided, vast, from which all\nobstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away. For what\nhad happened was that, while I recognised in this passage the same taste\nfor uncommon phrases, the same bursts of music, the same idealist\nphilosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my\nhaving taken them into account as the source of my pleasure, I now no\nlonger had the impression of being confronted by a particular passage in\none of Bergotte’s works, which traced a purely bi-dimensional figure in\noutline upon the surface of my mind, but rather of the ’ideal passage’ of\nBergotte, common to every one of his books, and to which all the earlier,\nsimilar passages, now becoming merged in it, had added a kind of density\nand volume, by which my own understanding seemed to be enlarged.",
        "I was by no means Bergotte’s sole admirer; he was the favourite writer\nalso of a friend of my mother’s, a highly literary lady; while Dr. du,\nBoulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished Bergotte’s\nlatest volume; and it was from his consulting room, and from a house in a\npark near Combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that\ntaste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally\nacclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe and\nAmerica, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its refinement,\nbut in that alone. What my mother’s friend, and, it would seem, what Dr.\ndu Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte was just what I\nliked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned phrases, and\ncertain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by him, in such\nprominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part; and\nalso, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness, a tone that was\nalmost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that these were his\nprincipal attractions. For in his later books, if he had hit upon some\ngreat truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral, he would break off\nhis narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a lengthy prayer,\nwould give a free outlet to that effluence which, in the earlier volumes,\nremained buried beneath the form of his prose, discernible only in a\nrippling of its surface, and perhaps even more delightful, more harmonious\nwhen it was thus veiled from the eye, when the reader could give no\nprecise indication of where the murmur of the current began, or of where\nit died away. These passages in which he delighted were our favourites\nalso. For my own part I knew all of them by heart. I felt even\ndisappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Whenever he\nspoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me, of\npine-forests or of hailstorms, of Notre-Dame de Paris, of Athalie, or\nof Phèdre, by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode\nand drench me with its essence. And so, dimly realising that the universe\ncontained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless\nto discern, did he not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might\nhave his opinion, some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and\nespecially upon such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of\nseeing for myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon\nsome of the historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea,\nbecause the emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed\nthat he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon\nalmost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no\ndoubt that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from\nan unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced\nthat my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected\nspirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to\nfind in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own\nmind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity\nhad, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be\nbeautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte\nwould express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when I\nwas unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so\nconcisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of\nmottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later\nyears, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some\nof my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to\ngo on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences in\nBergotte’s.  But it was only then, when I read them in his pages, that I\ncould enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in my anxiety\nthat they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have detected in my\nmind, and in my fear of their not turning out ’true to life,’ I had no\ntime to ask myself whether what I was writing would be pleasant to read!\nBut indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of ideas which I really\nliked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were\nthemselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no pleasure, but\nwas, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came suddenly upon\nsimilar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say stripped of\ntheir familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and\nself-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for\nsuch things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to prepare\nfor other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And so, when I\nhad found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about an old family\nservant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of\nirony, but which was in principle what I had often said to my grandmother\nabout Françoise, and when, another time, I had discovered that he thought\nnot unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute Truth which\nwere his writings, a remark similar to one which I had had occasion to\nmake on our friend M. Legrandin (and, moreover, my remarks on Françoise\nand M. Legrandin were among those which I would most resolutely have\nsacrificed for Bergotte’s sake, in the belief that he would find them\nquite without interest); then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own\nhumble existence and the Realms of Truth were less widely separated than I\nhad supposed, that at certain points they were actually in contact; and in\nmy new-found confidence and joy I wept upon his printed page, as in the\narms of a long-lost father.",
        "From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and\ndisappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any\nconsolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my\nbrain, with rather more dolce, rather more lento than he himself had,\nperhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with\nsomething peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than\nanything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged\nmyself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the age\nwhen I should be eligible to attend the class at school called\n’Philosophy.’ I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but\nsimply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and, if I\nhad been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to follow\nthere resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by the\ndespair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when a friend\nspeaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to come.",
        "One Sunday, while I was reading in the garden, I was interrupted by Swann,\nwho had come to call upon my parents.",
        "“What are you reading? May I look? Why, it’s Bergotte! Who has been\ntelling you about him?”",
        "I replied that Bloch was responsible.",
        "“Oh, yes, that boy I saw here once, who looks so like the Bellini portrait\nof Mahomet II. It’s an astonishing likeness; he has the same arched\neyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones. When his beard comes\nhe’ll be Mahomet himself. Anyhow he has good taste, for Bergotte is a\ncharming creature.” And seeing how much I seemed to admire Bergotte,\nSwann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made an exception\nin my favour and said: “I know him well; if you would like him to write a\nfew words on the title-page of your book I could ask him for you.”",
        "I dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions about\nhis friend. “Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?”",
        "“Actor? No, I can’t say. But I do know this: there’s not a man on the\nstage whom he thinks equal to Berma; he puts her above everyone. Have you\nseen her?”",
        "“No, sir, my parents do not allow me to go to the theatre.”",
        "“That is a pity. You should insist. Berma in Phèdre, in the Cid; well,\nshe’s only an actress, if you like, but you know that I don’t believe very\nmuch in the ’hierarchy’ of the arts.” As he spoke I noticed, what had\noften struck me before in his conversations with my grandmother’s sisters,\nthat whenever he spoke of serious matters, whenever he used an expression\nwhich seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject, he\nwould take care to isolate, to sterilise it by using a special intonation,\nmechanical and ironic, as though he had put the phrase or word between\ninverted commas, and was anxious to disclaim any personal responsibility\nfor it; as who should say “the ’hierarchy,’ don’t you know, as silly\npeople call it.” But then, if it was so absurd, why did he say the\n’hierarchy’? A moment later he went on: “Her acting will give you as noble\nan inspiration as any masterpiece of art in the world, as–oh, I don’t\nknow–” and he began to laugh, “shall we say the Queens of Chartres?\"\nUntil then I had supposed that his horror of having to give a serious\nopinion was something Parisian and refined, in contrast to the provincial\ndogmatism of my grandmother’s sisters; and I had imagined also that it was\ncharacteristic of the mental attitude towards life of the circle in which\nSwann moved, where, by a natural reaction from the ’lyrical’ enthusiasms\nof earlier generations, an excessive importance was given to small and\nprecise facts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of\n’phrase-making’ was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked by\nthis attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with\ngeneralities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and to\nbe at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy, some\nprecise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take into\naccount that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief (as they\nsay) for something, that the accuracy of his details had an importance of\nits own.  I thought again of the dinner that night, when I had been so\nunhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and when he had\ndismissed the balls given by the Princesse de Léon as being of no\nimportance.  And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was\ndevoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve the\nduties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things, of\nformulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas; and\nwhen would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the\nsame, time he made out that they were absurd? I noticed, too, in the\nmanner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do him\njustice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that writer’s\nadmirers at that time, at least by my mother’s friend and by Dr. du\nBoulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: “He has a charming mind,\nso individual, he has a way of his own of saying things, which is a little\nfar-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look for his name on the\ntitle-page, you can tell his work at once.” But none of them had yet gone\nso far as to say “He is a great writer, he has great talent.” They did not\neven credit him with talent at all. They did not speak, because they were\nnot aware of it. We are very slow in recognising in the peculiar\nphysiognomy of a new writer the type which is labelled ’great talent’ in\nour museum of general ideas. Simply because that physiognomy is new and\nstrange, we can find in it no resemblance to what we are accustomed to\ncall talent. We say rather originality, charm, delicacy, strength; and\nthen one day we add up the sum of these, and find that it amounts simply\nto talent.",
        "“Are there any books in which Bergotte has written about Berma?” I asked\nM. Swann.",
        "“I think he has, in that little essay on Racine, but it must be out of\nprint. Still, there has perhaps been a second impression. I will find out.\nAnyhow, I can ask Bergotte himself all that you want to know next time he\ncomes to dine with us. He never misses a week, from one year’s end to\nanother. He is my daughter’s greatest friend. They go about together, and\nlook at old towns and cathedrals and castles.”",
        "As I was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social\nhierarchy, the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see\nanything of Swann’s wife and daughter had, for a long time, had the\ncontrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an\nenormous gulf, which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in my\neyes. I was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her lips,\nas I had heard our neighbour, Mme. Sazerat, say that Mme. Swann did, to\ngratify not her husband but M. de Charlus; and I felt that, to her, we\nmust be an object of scorn, which distressed me particularly on account of\nthe daughter, such a pretty little girl, as I had heard, and one of whom I\nused often to dream, always imagining her with the same features and\nappearance, which I bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily, but with a\ncharming effect. But from this afternoon, when I had learned that Mile.\nSwann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate circumstances,\nbathed, as in her natural element, in such a sea of privilege that, if she\nshould ask her parents whether anyone were coming to dinner, she would be\nanswered in those two syllables, radiant with celestial light, would hear\nthe name of that golden guest who was to her no more than an old friend of\nher family, Bergotte; that for her the intimate conversation at table,\ncorresponding to what my great-aunt’s conversation was for me, would be\nthe words of Bergotte upon all those subjects which he had not been able\nto take up in his writings, and on which I would fain have heard him utter\noracles; and that, above all, when she went to visit other towns, he would\nbe walking by her side, unrecognised and glorious, like the gods who came\ndown, of old, from heaven to dwell among mortal men: then I realised both\nthe rare worth of a creature such as Mile. Swann, and, at the same time,\nhow coarse and ignorant I should appear to her; and I felt so keenly how\npleasant and yet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend\nthat I was filled at once with longing and with despair. And usually, from\nthis time forth, when I thought of her, I would see her standing before\nthe porch of a cathedral, explaining to me what each of the statues meant,\nand, with a smile which was my highest commendation, presenting me, as her\nfriend, to Bergotte.  And invariably the charm of all the fancies which\nthe thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me, the charm of the hills\nand valleys of the He de France and of the plains of Normandy, would\nradiate brightness and beauty over the picture I had formed in my mind of\nMile. Swann; nothing more remained but to know and to love her. Once we\nbelieve that a fellow-creature has a share in some unknown existence to\nwhich that creature’s love for ourselves can win us admission, that is, of\nall the preliminary conditions which Love exacts, the one to which he\nattaches most importance, the one which makes him generous or indifferent\nas to the rest. Even those women who pretend that they judge a man by his\nexterior only, see in that exterior an emanation from some special way of\nlife. And that is why they fall in love with a soldier or a fireman, whose\nuniform makes them less particular about his face; they kiss and believe\nthat beneath the crushing breastplate there beats a heart different from\nthe rest, more gallant, more adventurous, more tender; and so it is that a\nyoung king or a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the\nmost gratifying conquests, and yet lack entirely that regular and classic\nprofile which would be indispensable, I dare say, in an outside-broker.",
        "While I was reading in the garden, a thing my great-aunt would never have\nunderstood my doing save on a Sunday, that being the day on which it was\nunlawful to indulge in any serious occupation, and on which she herself\nwould lay aside her sewing (on a week-day she would have said, “How you\ncan go on amusing yourself with a book; it isn’t Sunday, you know!\"\nputting into the word ’amusing’ an implication of childishness and waste\nof time), my aunt Léonie would be gossiping with Françoise until it was\ntime for Eulalie to arrive. She would tell her that she had just seen Mme.\nGoupil go by “without an umbrella, in the silk dress she had made for her\nthe other day at Châteaudun. If she has far to go before vespers, she may\nget it properly soaked.”",
        "“Very likely” (which meant also “very likely not”) was the answer, for\nFrançoise did not wish definitely to exclude the possibility of a happier\nalternative.",
        "“There, now,” went on my aunt, beating her brow, “that reminds me that I\nnever heard if she got to church this morning before the Elevation.  I\nmust remember to ask Eulalie... Françoise, just look at that black cloud\nbehind the steeple, and how poor the light is on the slates, you may be\ncertain it will rain before the day is out. It couldn’t possibly keep on\nlike this, it’s been too hot. And the sooner the better, for until the\nstorm breaks my Vichy water won’t ’go down,’” she concluded, since, in her\nmind, the desire to accelerate the digestion of her Vichy water was of\ninfinitely greater importance than her fear of seeing Mme. Goupil’s new\ndress ruined.",
        "“Very likely.”",
        "“And you know that when it rains in the Square there’s none too much\nshelter.” Suddenly my aunt turned pale. “What, three o’clock!” she\nexclaimed.  “But vespers will have begun already, and I’ve forgotten my\npepsin!  Now I know why that Vichy water has been lying on my stomach.\"\nAnd falling precipitately upon a prayer-book bound in purple velvet, with\ngilt clasps, out of which in her haste she let fall a shower of the little\npictures, each in a lace fringe of yellowish paper, which she used to mark\nthe places of the greater feasts of the church, my aunt, while she\nswallowed her drops, began at full speed to mutter the words of the sacred\ntext, its meaning being slightly clouded in her brain by the uncertainty\nwhether the pepsin, when taken so long after the Vichy, would still be\nable to overtake it and to ’send it down.’ “Three o’clock! It’s\nunbelievable how time flies.”",
        "A little tap at the window, as though some missile had struck it, followed\nby a plentiful, falling sound, as light, though, as if a shower of sand\nwere being sprinkled from a window overhead; then the fall spread, took on\nan order, a rhythm, became liquid, loud, drumming, musical, innumerable,\nuniversal. It was the rain.",
        "“There, Françoise, what did I tell you? How it’s coming down! But I think\nI heard the bell at the garden gate: go along and see who can be outside\nin this weather.”",
        "Françoise went and returned. “It’s Mme. Amédée” (my grandmother).  “She\nsaid she was going for a walk. It’s raining hard, all the same.”",
        "“I’m not at all surprised,” said my aunt, looking up towards the sky.\n\"I’ve always said that she was not in the least like other people. Well,\nI’m glad it’s she and not myself who’s outside in all this.”",
        "“Mme. Amédée is always the exact opposite of the rest,” said Françoise,\nnot unkindly, refraining until she should be alone with the other servants\nfrom stating her belief that my grandmother was ’a bit off her head.’",
        "“There’s Benediction over! Eulalie will never come now,” sighed my aunt.\n\"It will be the weather that’s frightened her away.”",
        "“But it’s not five o’clock yet, Mme. Octave, it’s only half-past four.”",
        "“Only half-past four! And here am I, obliged to draw back the small\ncurtains, just to get a tiny streak of daylight. At half-past four! Only a\nweek before the Rogation-days. Ah, my poor Françoise, the dear Lord must\nbe sorely vexed with us. The world is going too far in these days. As my\npoor Octave used to say, we have forgotten God too often, and He is taking\nvengeance upon us.”",
        "A bright flush animated my aunt’s cheeks; it was Eulalie. As ill luck\nwould have it, scarcely had she been admitted to the presence when\nFrançoise reappeared and, with a smile which was meant to indicate her\nfull participation in the pleasure which, she had no doubt, her tidings\nwould give my aunt, articulating each syllable so as to shew that, in\nspite of her having to translate them into indirect speech, she was\nrepeating, as a good servant should, the very words which the new visitor\nhad condescended to use, said: “His reverence the Curé would be delighted,\nenchanted, if Mme. Octave is not resting just now, and could see him. His\nreverence does not wish to disturb Mme. Octave. His reverence is\ndownstairs; I told him to go into the parlour.”",
        "Had the truth been known, the Curé’s visits gave my aunt no such ecstatic\npleasure as Françoise supposed, and the air of jubilation with which she\nfelt bound to illuminate her face whenever she had to announce his\narrival, did not altogether correspond to what was felt by her invalid.\nThe Curé (an excellent man, with whom I am sorry now that I did not\nconverse more often, for, even if he cared nothing for the arts, he knew a\ngreat many etymologies), being in the habit of shewing distinguished\nvisitors over his church (he had even planned to compile a history of the\nParish of Com-bray), used to weary her with his endless explanations,\nwhich, incidentally, never varied in the least degree. But when his visit\nsynchronized exactly with Eulalie’s it became frankly distasteful to my\naunt. She would have preferred to make the most of Eulalie, and not to\nhave had the whole of her circle about her at one time. But she dared not\nsend the Curé away, and had to content herself with making a sign to\nEulalie not to leave when he did, so that she might have her to herself\nfor a little after he had gone.",
        "“What is this I have been hearing, Father, that a painter has set up his\neasel in your church, and is copying one of the windows? Old as I am, I\ncan safely say that I have never even heard of such a thing in all my\nlife!  What is the world coming to next, I wonder! And the ugliest thing\nin the whole church, too.”",
        "“I will not go so far as to say that it is quite the ugliest, for,\nalthough there are certain things in Saint-Hilaire which are well worth a\nvisit, there are others that are very old now, in my poor basilica, the\nonly one in all the diocese that has never even been restored. The Lord\nknows, our porch is dirty and out of date; still, it is of a majestic\ncharacter; take, for instance, the Esther tapestries, though personally I\nwould not give a brass farthing for the pair of them, but experts put them\nnext after the ones at Sens. I can quite see, too, that apart from certain\ndetails which are–well, a trifle realistic, they shew features which\ntestify to a genuine power of observation.  But don’t talk to me about the\nwindows. Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave up windows which shut out\nall the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour,\nto which I should be hard put to it to give a name, on a floor in which\nthere are not two slabs on the same level? And yet they refuse to renew\nthe floor for me because, if you please, those are the tombstones of the\nAbbots of Combray and the Lords of Guermantes, the old Counts, you know,\nof Brabant, direct ancestors of the present Duc de Guermantes, and of his\nDuchesse also, since she was a lady of the Guermantes family, and married\nher cousin.” (My grandmother, whose steady refusal to take any interest in\n’persons’ had ended in her confusing all their names and titles, whenever\nanyone mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes used to make out that she must\nbe related to Mme. de Villeparisis. The whole family would then burst out\nlaughing; and she would attempt to justify herself by harking back to some\ninvitation to a christening or funeral: “I feel sure that there was a\nGuermantes in it somewhere.” And for once I would side with the others,\nand against her, refusing to admit that there could be any connection\nbetween her school-friend and the descendant of Geneviève de Brabant.)",
        "“Look at Roussainville,” the Curé went on. “It is nothing more nowadays\nthan a parish of farmers, though in olden times the place must have had a\nconsiderable importance from its trade in felt hats and clocks. (I am not\ncertain, by the way, of the etymology of Roussainville. I should dearly\nlike to think that the name was originally Rouville, from Radulfi villa,\nanalogous, don’t you see, to Châteauroux, Castrum Radulfi, but we will\ntalk about that some other time.) Very well; the church there has superb\nwindows, almost all quite modern, including that most imposing ’Entry of\nLouis-Philippe into Combray’ which would be more in keeping, surely, at\nCombray itself, and which is every bit as good, I understand, as the\nfamous^windows at Chartres. Only yesterday I met Dr. Percepied’s brother,\nwho goes in for these things, and he told me that he looked upon it as a\nmost beautiful piece of work. But, as I said to this artist, who, by the\nway, seems to be a most civil fellow, and is a regular virtuoso, it\nappears, with his brush; what on earth, I said to him, do you find so\nextraordinary in this window, which is, if anything, a little dingier than\nthe rest?”",
        "“I am sure that if you were to ask his Lordship,” said my aunt in a\nresigned tone, for she had begun to feel that she was going to be ’tired,’\n\"he would never refuse you a new window.”",
        "“You may depend upon it, Mme. Octave,” replied the Curé. “Why, it was just\nhis Lordship himself who started the outcry about the window, by proving\nthat it represented Gilbert the Bad, a Lord of Guermantes and a direct\ndescendant of Geneviève de Brabant, who was a daughter of the House of\nGuermantes, receiving absolution from Saint Hilaire.”",
        "“But I don’t see where Saint Hilaire comes in.”",
        "“Why yes, have you never noticed, in the corner of the window, a lady in a\nyellow robe? Very well, that is Saint Hilaire, who is also known, you will\nremember, in certain parts of the country as Saint Illiers, Saint Hèlier,\nand even, in the Jura, Saint Ylie. But these various corruptions of\nSanctus Hilarius are by no means the most curious that have occurred in\nthe names of the blessed Saints. Take, for example, my good Eulalie, the\ncase of your own patron, Sancta Eulalia; do you know what she has become\nin Burgundy?  Saint Eloi, nothing more nor less! The lady has become a\ngentleman.  Do you hear that, Eulalie, after you are dead they will make a\nman of you!”",
        "“Father will always have his joke.”",
        "“Gilbert’s brother, Charles the Stammerer, was a pious prince, but, having\nearly in life lost his father, Pepin the Mad, who died as a result of his\nmental infirmity, he wielded the supreme power with all the arrogance of a\nman who has not been subjected to discipline in his youth, so much so\nthat, whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he did not remember, he\nwould massacre the whole place, to the last inhabitant. Gilbert, wishing\nto be avenged on Charles, caused the church at Combray to be burned down,\nthe original church, that was, which Théodebert, when he and his court\nleft the country residence he had near here, at Thiberzy (which is, of\ncourse, Theodeberiacus), to go out and fight the Burgundians, had\npromised to build over the tomb of Saint Hilaire if the Saint brought him;\nvictory. Nothing remains of it now but the crypt, into which Théodore has\nprobably taken you, for Gilbert burned all the rest. Finally, he defeated\nthe unlucky Charles with the aid of William” which the Curé pronounced\n\"Will’am” “the Conqueror, which is why so many English still come to visit\nthe place. But he does not appear to have managed to win the affection of\nthe people of Combray, for they fell upon him as he was coming out from\nmass, and cut off his head. Théodore has a little book, that he lends\npeople, which tells you the whole story.",
        "“But what is unquestionably the most remarkable thing about our church is\nthe view from the belfry, which is full of grandeur. Certainly in your\ncase, since you are not very strong, I should never recommend you: to\nclimb our seven and ninety steps, just half the number they have in the\nfamous cathedral at Milan. It is quite tiring enough for the most active\nperson, especially as you have to go on your hands and knees, if you don’t\nwish to crack your skull, and you collect all the cobwebs off the\nstaircase upon your clothes. In any case you should be well wrapped up,\"\nhe went on, without noticing my aunt’s fury at the mere suggestion that\nshe could ever, possibly, be capable of climbing into his belfry, “for\nthere’s a strong breeze there, once you get to the top. Some people even\nassure me that they have felt the chill of death up there. No matter, on\nSundays there are always clubs and societies, who come, some of them, long\ndistances to admire our beautiful panorama, and they always go home\ncharmed.  Wait now, next Sunday, if the weather holds, you will be sure to\nfind a lot of people there, for Rogation-tide. You must admit, certainly,\nthat the view from up there is like a fairy-tale, with what you might call\nvistas along the plain, which have quite a special charm of their own. On\na clear day you can see as far as Verneuil. And then another thing; you\ncan see at the same time places which you are in the habit of seeing one\nwithout the other, as, for instance, the course of the Vivonne and the\nditches at Saint-Assise-lès-Combray, which are separated, really, by a\nscreen of tall trees; or, to take another example, there are all the\ncanals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, which is Gaudiacus vicecomitis, as of course\nyou know. Each time that I have been to Jouy I have seen a bit of a canal\nin one place, and then I have turned a corner and seen another, but when I\nsaw the second I could no longer see the first. I tried in vain to imagine\nhow they lay by one another; it was no good. But, from the top of\nSaint-Hilaire, it’s quite another matter; the whole countryside is spread\nout before you like a map. Only, you cannot make out the water; you would\nsay that there were great rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that\nit looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been\ncut up. To get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at\nonce; up here on the top of Saint-Hilaire and down there at\nJouy-le-Vicomte.”",
        "The Curé had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than she\nwas obliged to send away Eulalie also.",
        "“Here, my poor Eulalie,” she said in a feeble voice, drawing a coin from a\nsmall purse which lay ready to her hand. “This is just something so that\nyou shall not forget me in your prayers.”",
        "“Oh, but, Mme. Octave, I don’t think I ought to; you know very well that I\ndon’t come here for that!” So Eulalie would answer, with the same\nhesitation and the same embarrassment, every Sunday, as though each\ntemptation were the first, and with a look of displeasure which enlivened\nmy aunt and never offended her, for if it so happened that Eulalie, when\nshe took the money, looked a little less sulky than usual, my aunt would\nremark afterwards, “I cannot think what has come over Eulalie; I gave her\njust the trifle I always give, and she did not look at all pleased.”",
        "“I don’t think she has very much to complain of, all the same,” Françoise\nwould sigh grimly, for she had a tendency to regard as petty cash all that\nmy aunt might give her for herself or her children, and as treasure\nriotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the little coins\nslipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie’s hand, but so discreetly passed\nthat Françoise never managed to see them. It was not that she wanted to\nhave for herself the money my aunt bestowed on Eulalie. She already\nenjoyed a sufficiency of all that my aunt possessed, in the knowledge that\nthe wealth of the mistress automatically ennobled and glorified the maid\nin the eyes of the world; and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy\nto be praised throughout Combray, Jouy-le-Vicomte, and other cities of\nmen, on account of my aunt’s many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits\nfrom the Curé, and the astonishing number of bottles of Vichy water which\nshe consumed.  Françoise was avaricious only for my aunt; had she had\ncontrol over my aunt’s fortune (which would have more than satisfied her\nhighest ambition) she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers\nwith a maternal ferocity. She would, however, have seen no great harm in\nwhat my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to\ngive away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps she\nfelt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt’s presents,\ncould not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account.\nBesides, presents offered to persons of great wealth and position, such as\nMme.  Sazerat, M. Swann, M. Legrandin and Mme. Goupil, to persons of the\n’same class’ as my aunt, and who would naturally ’mix with her,’ seemed to\nFrançoise to be included among the ornamental customs of that strange and\nbrilliant life led by rich people, who hunted and shot, gave balls and\npaid visits, a life which she would contemplate with an admiring smile.\nBut it was by no means the same thing if, for this princely exchange of\ncourtesies, my aunt substituted mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of\nthe class which Françoise would label “people like myself,” or “people no\nbetter than myself,” people whom she despised even more if they did not\naddress her always as “Mme. Françoise,” just to shew that they considered\nthemselves to be ’not as good.’ And when she saw that, despite all her\nwarnings, my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling\nmoney away with both hands (or so, at least, Françoise believed) on\nundeserving objects, she began to find that the presents she herself\nreceived from my aunt were very tiny compared to the imaginary riches\nsquandered upon Eulalie, There was not, in the neighbourhood of Combray, a\nfarm of such prosperity and importance that Françoise doubted Eulalie’s\nability to buy it, without thinking twice, out of the capital which her\nvisits to my aunt had ’brought in.’ It must be added that Eulalie had\nformed an exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of\nFrançoise. So, every Sunday, after Eulalie had gone, Françoise would\nmercilessly prophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at\nthe same time afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to\n’look pleasant.’ But she would make up for that after the other’s\ndeparture; never, it is true, alluding to her by name, but hinting at her\nin Sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like\nthose of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher, but so worded that their special\napplication could not escape my aunt. After peering out at the side of the\ncurtain to see whether Eulalie had shut the front-door behind her;\n\"Flatterers know how to make themselves welcome, and to gather up the\ncrumbs; but have patience, have patience; our God is a jealous God, and\none fine day He will be avenged upon them!” she would declaim, with the\nsidelong, insinuating glance of Joash, thinking of Athaliah alone when he\nsays that the",
        "    prosperity\n  Of wicked men runs like a torrent past,\n  And soon is spent.",
        "But on this memorable afternoon, when the Curé had come as well, and by\nhis interminable visit had drained my aunt’s strength, Françoise followed\nEulalie from the room, saying: “Mme. Octave, I will leave you to rest; you\nlook utterly tired out.”",
        "And my aunt answered her not a word, breathing a sigh so faint that it\nseemed it must prove her last, and lying there with closed eyes, as though\nalready dead. But hardly had Françoise arrived downstairs, when four peals\nof a bell, pulled with the utmost violence, reverberated through the\nhouse, and my aunt, sitting erect upon her bed, called out: “Has Eulalie\ngone yet? Would you believe it; I forgot to ask her whether Mme. Goupil\narrived in church before the Elevation. Run after her, quick!”",
        "But Françoise returned alone, having failed to overtake Eulalie.  “It is\nmost provoking,” said my aunt, shaking her head. “The one important thing\nthat I had to ask her.”",
        "In this way life went by for my aunt Léonie, always the same, in the\ngentle uniformity of what she called, with a pretence of deprecation but\nwith a deep tenderness, her ’little jog-trot.’ Respected by all and\nsundry, not merely in her own house, where every one of us, having learned\nthe futility of recommending any healthier mode of life, had become\ngradually resigned to its observance, but in the village as well, where,\nthree streets away, a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a\npacking-case would send first to Françoise to make sure that my aunt was\nnot ’resting’–her ’little jog-trot’ was, none the less, brutally\ndisturbed on one occasion in this same year. Like a fruit hidden among its\nleaves, which has grown and ripened unobserved by man, until it falls of\nits own accord, there came upon us one night the kitchen-maid’s\nconfinement. Her pains were unbearable, and, as there was no midwife in\nCombray, Françoise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from Thiberzy.\nMy aunt was unable to ’rest,’ owing to the cries of the girl, and as\nFrançoise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in returning,\nher services were greatly missed.  And so, in the course of the morning,\nmy mother said to me: “Run upstairs, and see if your aunt wants anything.”",
        "I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the\nother saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing,\nin what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip\naway when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her\nsleep, and made it ’change speed,’ as they say of motorcars nowadays, for\nthe music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a lower\nnote; then she awoke, and half turned her face, which I could see for the\nfirst time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she had just\nescaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from where she\nwas lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go forward or\nto retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality, and\nto grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her; a smile of\njoy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased to grant that life\nshall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined her face, and, with\nthe habit she had formed of speaking to herself, half-aloud, when she\nthought herself alone, she murmured: “The Lord be praised! We have nothing\nto disturb us here but the kitchen-maid’s baby. And I’ve been dreaming\nthat my poor Octave had come back to life, and was trying to make me take\na walk every day!” She stretched out a hand towards her rosary, which was\nlying on the small table, but sleep was once again getting the mastery,\nand did not leave her the strength to reach it; she fell asleep, calm and\ncontented, and I crept out of the room on tiptoe, without either her or\nanyone’s else ever knowing, from that day to this, what I had seen and\nheard.",
        "When I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my\naunt’s ’little jog-trot’ never underwent any variation, I do not include\nthose variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical\nform, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the\ngreater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as\nFrançoise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin,\nthe whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my\naunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to her\ngeneral habits, that she clung to it as much as to the rest. She was so\nwell ’routined’ to it, as Françoise would say, that if, on a Saturday, she\nhad had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour, it would have\n’upset’ her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary day, to put her\nluncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this acceleration of\nluncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual character, kindly and\nrather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily, there was still an hour\nto be lived through before meal-time sounded, we would all know that in a\nfew seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance,\nfollowed by the special favour of an omelette, an unmerited steak. The\nreturn of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those petty occurrences,\nintra-mural, localised, almost civic, which, in uneventful lives and\nstable orders of society, create a kind of national unity, and become the\nfavourite theme for conversation, for pleasantries, for anecdotes which\ncan be embroidered as the narrator pleases; it would have provided a\nnucleus, ready-made, for a legendary cycle, if any of us had had the epic\nmind. At daybreak, before we were dressed, without rhyme or reason, save\nfor the pleasure of proving the strength of our solidarity, we would call\nto one another good-humoredly, cordially, patriotically, “Hurry up;\nthere’s no time to be lost; don’t forget, it’s Saturday!” while my aunt,\ngossiping with Françoise, and reflecting that the day would be even longer\nthan usual, would say, “You might cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing\nthat it’s Saturday.” If, at half-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled\nout a watch and said, “I say, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,\"\neveryone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once:\n\"Why, what are you thinking about? Have you for-gotten that it’s\nSaturday?” And a quarter of an hour later we would still be laughing, and\nreminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt Léonie about this absurd\nmistake, to amuse her. The very face of the sky appeared to undergo a\nchange. After luncheon the sun, conscious that it was Saturday, would\nblaze an hour longer in the zenith, and when some one, thinking that we\nwere late in starting for our walk, said, “What, only two o’clock!\"\nfeeling the heavy throb go by him of the twin strokes from the steeple of\nSaint-Hilaire (which as a rule passed no one at that hour upon the\nhighways, deserted for the midday meal or for the nap which follows it, or\non the banks of the bright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler\nhad abandoned, and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where\nonly a few loitering clouds remained to greet them) the whole family would\nrespond in chorus: “Why, you’re forgetting; we had luncheon an hour\nearlier; you know very well it’s Saturday.”",
        "The surprise of a ’barbarian’ (for so we termed everyone who was not\nacquainted with Saturday’s special customs) who had called at eleven\no’clock to speak to my father, and had found us at table, was an event\nwhich used to cause Françoise as much merriment as, perhaps, anything that\nhad ever happened in her life. And if she found it amusing that the\nnonplussed visitor should not have known, beforehand, that we had our\nluncheon an hour earlier on Saturday, it was still more irresistibly funny\nthat my father himself (fully as she sympathised, from the bottom of her\nheart, with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him) should never have\ndreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter,\nand so had replied, with no further enlightenment of the other’s surprise\nat seeing us already in the dining-room: “You see, it’s Saturday.” On\nreaching this point in the story, Françoise would pause to wipe the tears\nof merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own enjoyment, would\nprolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom\nthe word ’Saturday’ had conveyed nothing. And so far from our objecting to\nthese interpolations, we would feel that the story was not yet long\nenough, and would rally her with: “Oh, but surely he said something else\nas well. There was more than that, the first time you told it.”",
        "My great-aunt herself would lay aside her work, and raise her head and\nlook on at us over her glasses.",
        "The day had yet another characteristic feature, namely, that during May we\nused to go out on Saturday evenings after dinner to the ’Month of Mary’\ndevotions.",
        "As we were liable, there, to meet M. Vinteuil, who held very strict views\non “the deplorable untidiness of young people, which seems to be\nencouraged in these days,” my mother would first see that there was\nnothing out of order in my appearance, and then we would set out for the\nchurch.  It was in these ’Month of Mary’ services that I can remember\nhaving first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not\nmerely in the church, for there, holy ground as it was, we had all of us a\nright of entry; but, arranged upon the altar itself, inseparable from the\nmysteries in whose celebration it was playing a part, it thrust in among\nthe tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches, tied to one\nanother horizontally in a stiff, festal scheme of decoration; and they\nwere made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves,\nover which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train, little\nclusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness.  Though I dared not look at them\nsave through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed\nof living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the\nshape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy\nbuds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public\nrejoicing and a solemn mystery.  Higher up on the altar, a flower had\nopened here and there with a careless grace, holding so unconcernedly,\nlike a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of stamens, slender as\ngossamer, which clouded the flower itself in a white mist, that in\nfollowing these with my eyes, in trying to imitate, somewhere inside\nmyself, the action of their blossoming, I imagined it as a swift and\nthoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance from her\ncontracted pupils, by a young girl in white, careless and alive.",
        "M. Vinteuil had come in with his daughter and had sat down beside us.  He\nbelonged to a good family, and had once been music-master to my\ngrandmother’s sisters; so that when, after losing his wife and inheriting\nsome property, he had retired to the neighbourhood of Combray, we used\noften to invite him to our house. But with his intense prudishness he had\ngiven up coming, so as not to be obliged to meet Swann, who had made what\nhe called “a most unsuitable marriage, as seems to be the fashion in these\ndays.” My mother, on hearing that he ’composed,’ told him by way of a\ncompliment that, when she came to see him, he must play her something of\nhis own. M. Vinteuil would have liked nothing better, but he carried\npoliteness and consideration for others to so fine a point, always putting\nhimself in their place, that he was afraid of boring them, or of appearing\negotistical, if he carried out, or even allowed them to suspect what were\nhis own desires. On the day when my parents had gone to pay him a visit, I\nhad accompanied them, but they had allowed me to remain outside, and as M.\nVinteuil’s house, Montjouvain, stood on a site actually hollowed out from\na steep hill covered with shrubs, among which I took cover, I had found\nmyself on a level with his drawing-room, upstairs, and only a few feet\naway from its window. When a servant came in to tell him that my parents\nhad arrived, I had seen M. Vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet\nof music so as to catch the eye. But as soon as they entered the room he\nhad snatched it away and hidden it in a corner. He was afraid, no doubt,\nof letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave\nhim a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time that\nmy mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject of his\nplaying, he had hurriedly protested: “I cannot think who put that on the\npiano; it is not the proper place for it at all,” and had turned the\nconversation aside to other topics, simply because those were of less\ninterest to himself.",
        "His one and only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her somewhat\nboyish appearance, looked so robust that it was hard to restrain a smile\nwhen one saw the precautions her father used to take for her health, with\nspare shawls always in readiness to wrap around her shoulders. My\ngrandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle, delicate, almost timid\nexpression which might often be caught flitting across the face, dusted\nall over with freckles, of this otherwise stolid child. When she had\nspoken, she would at once take her own words in the sense in which her\naudience must have heard them, she would be alarmed at the possibility of\na misunderstanding, and one would see, in clear outline, as though in a\ntransparency, beneath the mannish face of the ’good sort’ that she was,\nthe finer features of a young woman in tears.",
        "When, before turning to leave the church, I made a genuflection before the\naltar, I felt suddenly, as I rose again, a bitter-sweet fragrance of\nalmonds steal towards me from the hawthorn-blossom, and I then noticed\nthat on the flowers themselves were little spots of a creamier colour, in\nwhich I imagined that this fragrance must lie concealed, as the taste of\nan almond cake lay in the burned parts, or the sweetness of Mile.\nVinteuil’s cheeks beneath their freckles. Despite the heavy, motionless\nsilence of the hawthorns, these gusts of fragrance came to me like the\nmurmuring of an intense vitality, with which the whole altar was quivering\nlike a roadside hedge explored by living antennae, of which I was reminded\nby seeing some stamens, almost red in colour, which seemed to have kept\nthe springtime virulence, the irritant power of stinging insects now\ntransmuted into flowers.",
        "Outside the church we would stand talking for a moment with M.  Vinteuil,\nin the porch. Boys would be chevying one another in the Square, and he\nwould interfere, taking the side of the little ones and lecturing the big.\nIf his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she had\nbeen to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and more\nsensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless,\nschoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was\nangling for an invitation to the house. Her father would then arrange a\ncloak over her shoulders, they would clamber into a little dog-cart which\nshe herself drove, and home they would both go to Montjouvain. As for\nourselves, the next day being Sunday, with no need to be up and stirring\nbefore high mass, if it was a moonlight night and warm, then, instead of\ntaking us home at once, my father, in his thirst for personal distinction,\nwould lead us on a long walk round by the Calvary, which my mother’s utter\nincapacity for taking her bearings, or even for knowing which road she\nmight be on, made her regard as a triumph of his strategic genius.\nSometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, which began to stride on its\nlong legs of stone at the railway station, and to me typified all the\nwretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of civilisation, because\nevery year, as we came down from Paris, we would be warned to take special\ncare, when we got to Combray, not to miss the station, to be ready before\nthe train stopped, since it would start again in two minutes and proceed\nacross the viaduct, out of the lands of Christendom, of which Combray, to\nme, represented the farthest limit. We would return by the Boulevard de la\nGare, which contained the most attractive villas in the town. In each of\ntheir gardens the moonlight, copying the art of Hubert Robert, had\nscattered its broken staircases of white marble, its fountains of water\nand gates temptingly ajar. Its beams had swept away the telegraph office.\nAll that was left of it was a column, half shattered, but preserving the\nbeauty of a ruin which endures for all time. I would by now be dragging my\nweary limbs, and ready to drop with sleep; the balmy scent of the\nlime-trees seemed a consolation which I could obtain only at the price of\ngreat suffering and exhaustion, and not worthy of the effort. From gates\nfar apart the watchdogs, awakened by our steps in the silence, would set\nup an antiphonal barking, as I still hear them bark, at times, in the\nevenings, and it is in their custody (when the public gardens of Combray\nwere constructed on its site) that the Boulevard de la Gare must have\ntaken refuge, for wherever I may be, as soon as they begin their alternate\nchallenge and acceptance, I can see it again with all its lime-trees, and\nits pavement glistening beneath the moon.",
        "Suddenly my father would bring us to a standstill and ask my\nmother–\"Where are we?” Utterly worn out by the walk but still proud of\nher husband, she would lovingly confess that she had not the least idea.\nHe would shrug his shoulders and laugh. And then, as though it had\nslipped, with his latchkey, from his waistcoat pocket, he would point out\nto us, when it stood before our eyes, the back-gate of our own garden,\nwhich had come hand-in-hand with the familiar corner of the Rue du\nSaint-Esprit, to await us, to greet us at the end of our wanderings over\npaths unknown. My mother would murmur admiringly “You really are\nwonderful!” And from that instant I had not to take another step; the\nground moved forward under my feet in that garden where, for so long, my\nactions had ceased to require any control, or even attention, from my\nwill. Custom came to take me in her arms, carried me all the way up to my\nbed, and laid me down there like a little child.",
        "Although Saturday, by beginning an hour earlier, and by depriving her of\nthe services of Françoise, passed more slowly than other days for my aunt,\nyet, the moment it was past, and a new week begun, she would look forward\nwith impatience to its return, as something that embodied all the novelty\nand distraction which her frail and disordered body was still able to\nendure. This was not to say, however, that she did not long, at times, for\nsome even greater variation, that she did not pass through those abnormal\nhours in which one thirsts for something different from what one has, when\nthose people who, through lack of energy or imagination, are unable to\ngenerate any motive power in themselves, cry out, as the clock strikes or\nthe postman knocks, in their eagerness for news (even if it be bad news),\nfor some emotion (even that of grief); when the heartstrings, which\nprosperity has silenced, like a harp laid by, yearn to be plucked and\nsounded again by some hand, even a brutal hand, even if it shall break\nthem; when the will, which has with such difficulty brought itself to\nsubdue its impulse, to renounce its right to abandon itself to its own\nuncontrolled desires, and consequent sufferings, would fain cast its\nguiding reins into the hands of circumstances, coercive and, it may be,\ncruel. Of course, since my aunt’s strength, which was completely drained\nby the slightest exertion, returned but drop by drop into the pool of her\nrepose, the reservoir was very slow in filling, and months would go by\nbefore she reached that surplus which other people use up in their daily\nactivities, but which she had no idea–and could never decide how to\nemploy. And I have no doubt that then–just as a desire to have her\npotatoes served with béchamel sauce, for a change, would be formed,\nultimately, from the pleasure she found in the daily reappearance of those\nmashed potatoes of which she was never ’tired’–she would extract from the\naccumulation of those monotonous days (on which she so much depended) a\nkeen expectation of some domestic cataclysm, instantaneous in its\nhappening, but violent enough to compel her to put into effect, once for\nall, one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to her\nhealth, but to which she could never make up her mind without some such\nstimulus. She was genuinely fond of us; she would have enjoyed the long\nluxury of weeping for our untimely decease; coming at a moment when she\nfelt ’well’ and was not in a perspiration, the news that the house was\nbeing destroyed by a fire, in which all the rest of us had already\nperished, a fire which, in a little while, would not leave one stone\nstanding upon another, but from which she herself would still have plenty\nof time to escape without undue haste, provided that she rose at once from\nher bed, must often have haunted her dreams, as a prospect which combined\nwith the two minor advantages of letting her taste the full savour of her\naffection for us in long years of mourning, and of causing universal\nstupefaction in the village when she should sally forth to conduct our\nobsequies, crushed but courageous, moribund but erect, the paramount and\npriceless boon of forcing her at the right moment, with no time to be\nlost, no room for weakening hesitations, to go off and spend the summer at\nher charming farm of Mirougrain, where there was a waterfall. Inasmuch as\nnothing of this sort had ever occurred, though indeed she must often have\npondered the success of such a manoeuvre as she lay alone absorbed in her\ninterminable games of patience (and though it must have plunged her in\ndespair from the first moment of its realisation, from the first of those\nlittle unforeseen facts, the first word of calamitous news, whose accents\ncan never afterwards be expunged from the memory, everything that bears\nupon it the imprint of actual, physical death, so terribly different from\nthe logical abstraction of its possibility) she would fall back from time\nto time, to add an interest to her life, upon imagining other, minor\ncatastrophes, which she would follow up with passion. She would beguile\nherself with a sudden suspicion that Françoise had been robbing her, that\nshe had set a trap to make certain, and had caught her betrayer\nred-handed; and being in the habit, when she made up a game of cards by\nherself, of playing her own and her adversary’s hands at once, she would\nfirst stammer out Françoise’s awkward apologies, and then reply to them\nwith such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude upon\nher at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration, her\neyes blazing, her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness of her\nbrows. Françoise must often, from the next room, have heard these mordant\nsarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words would not\nhave relieved my aunt’s feelings sufficiently, had they been allowed to\nremain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree of substance and\nreality which she added to them by murmuring them half-aloud.  Sometimes,\nhowever, even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt; she must\nsee her work staged. And so, on a Sunday, with all the doors mysteriously\nclosed, she would confide in Eulalie her doubts of Françoise’s integrity\nand her determination to be rid of her, and on another day she would\nconfide in Françoise her suspicions of the disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom\nthe front-door would very soon be closed for good. A few days more, and,\ndisgusted with her latest confidant, she would again be ’as thick as\nthieves’ with the traitor, while, before the next performance, the two\nwould once more have changed their parts. But the suspicions which Eulalie\nmight occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw, which\nmust soon subside for lack of fuel, since Eulalie was not living with her\nin the house. It was a very different matter when the suspect was\nFrançoise, of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was\nperpetually conscious, while for fear of catching cold, were she to leave\nher bed, she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for\nherself whether there was, indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And\nso on by degrees, until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt,\nat every hour of the day, to discover what was being done, what was being\nconcealed from her by Françoise. She would detect the most furtive\nmovement of Françoise’s features, something contradictory in what she was\nsaying, some desire which she appeared to be screening.  And she would\nshew her that she was unmasked, by, a single word, which made Françoise\nturn pale, and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in\ndriving into her unhappy servant’s heart. And the very next Sunday a\ndisclosure by Eulalie–like one of those discoveries which suddenly open\nup an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has\nhitherto followed only the beaten paths–proved to my aunt that her own\nworst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth. “But\nFrançoise ought to know that,” said Eulalie, “now that you have given her\na carriage.”",
        "“Now that I have given her a carriage!” gasped my aunt.",
        "“Oh, but I didn’t know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in\nher open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market. I\nsupposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.”",
        "So on by degrees, until Françoise and my aunt, the quarry and the hunter,\ncould never cease from trying to forestall each other’s devices.  My\nmother was afraid lest Françoise should develop a genuine hatred of my\naunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However that\nmight be, Françoise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely\nscrupulous attention to my aunt’s least word and gesture. When she had to\nask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time, making up\nher mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her request, she\nwould watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the expression on her\nface what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this\nway–whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth\ncentury, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would\nconsider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed\na pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when\nhe engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of\nEurope, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking\nto establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere\noutward forms–a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no\nmore than yield whole-hearted obedience to her own irresistible\neccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter\nidleness of her existence, could see, without ever having given a thought\nto Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning\ntoilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their\ndespotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in\nwhat Saint-Simon used to call the ’machinery’ of life at Versailles; and\nwas able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good\nhumour or of arrogance on her features, would provide Françoise with\nmatter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did\nthe silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier,\nor even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition to him, at the\nturning of an avenue, at Versailles.",
        "One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Curé\nand from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the whole\nfamily went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured to condole\nwith her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both visitors to\nher door at the same time.",
        "“I hear that things went wrong again to-day, Léonie,” she said kindly,\n\"you have had all your friends here at once.”",
        "And my great-aunt interrupted with: “Too many good things...\"\nfor, since her daughter’s illness, she felt herself in duty bound to\nrevive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the\nbrighter side of things. But my father had begun to speak.",
        "“I should like to take advantage,” he said, “of the whole family’s being\nhere together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over\nagain to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin’s bad\nbooks; he would hardly say ’How d’ye do’ to me this morning.”",
        "I did not wait to hear the end of my father’s story, for I had been with\nhim myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went\ndownstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner,\nwhich was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and\nexcited me as might the programme of a coming festivity.",
        "As M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church, walking by\nthe side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood,\nwhom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in a manner at once\nfriendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M.  Legrandin had\nbarely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of surprise, as\nthough he had not recognised us, and with that distant look characteristic\nof people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from the suddenly\nreceding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far\nend of an interminably straight road, and at so great a distance that they\ncontent themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible\nmovement of the head, in proportion to your doll-like dimensions.",
        "Now, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue, known\nand highly respected; there could be no question of his being out for\namorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father asked\nhimself how he could possibly have displeased our friend.",
        "“I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,” he\nsaid, “because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there is\nsomething about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft neckties,\nso little ’dressed-up,’ so genuinely simple; an air of innocence, almost,\nwhich is really attractive.”",
        "But the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had\nimagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question,\nhad been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my father’s\nfears were dissipated no later than the following evening. As we returned\nfrom a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin himself, who, on\naccount of the holidays, was spending a few days more in Combray. He came\nup to us with outstretched hand: “Do you know, master book-lover,” he\nasked me, “this line of Paul Desjardins?",
        "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.",
        "Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have never\nread Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he is\nconverted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have the\nmost charming water-colour touch–",
        "  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.",
        "May you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even\nwhen the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all\nblack, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself,\nas I am doing, by looking up to the sky.” He took a cigarette from his\npocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon. “Goodbye,\nfriends!” he suddenly exclaimed, and left us.",
        "At the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what there was for\ndinner, its preparation would already have begun, and Françoise, a colonel\nwith all the forces of nature for her subalterns, as in the fairy-tales\nwhere giants hire themselves out as scullions, would be stirring the\ncoals, putting the potatoes to steam, and, at the right moment, finishing\nover the fire those culinary masterpieces which had been first got ready\nin some of the great array of vessels, triumphs of the potter’s craft,\nwhich ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons and fish kettles down to\njars for game, moulds for pastry, and tiny pannikins for cream, and\nincluded an entire collection of pots and pans of every shape and size. I\nwould stop by the table, where the kitchen-maid had shelled them, to\ninspect the platoons of peas, drawn up in ranks and numbered, like little\ngreen marbles, ready for a game; but what fascinated me would be the\nasparagus, tinged with ultramarine and rosy pink which ran from their\nheads, finely stippled in mauve and azure, through a series of\nimperceptible changes to their white feet, still stained a little by the\nsoil of their garden-bed: a rainbow-loveliness that was not of this world.\nI felt that these celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite\ncreatures who had been pleased to assume vegetable form, who, through the\ndisguise which covered their firm and edible flesh, allowed me to discern\nin this radiance of earliest dawn, these hinted rainbows, these blue\nevening shades, that precious quality which I should recognise again when,\nall night long after a dinner at which I had partaken of them, they played\n(lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare’s\nDream) at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic\nperfume.",
        "Poor Giotto’s Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Françoise with\nthe task of preparing them for the table, would have them lying beside her\nin a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows of the\nworld were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which capped the\nasparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately\noutlined, star by star, as in Giotto’s fresco are the flowers banded about\nthe brows, or patterning the basket of his Virtue at Padua. And,\nmeanwhile, Françoise would be turning on the spit one of those chickens,\nsuch as she alone knew how to roast, chickens which had wafted far abroad\nfrom Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while she was\nserving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness\npredominate for the moment in my private conception of her character; the\naroma of that cooked flesh, which she knew how to make so unctuous and so\ntender, seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of her many\nvirtues.",
        "But the day on which, while my father took counsel with his family upon\nour strange meeting with Legrandin, I went down to the kitchen, was one of\nthose days when Giotto’s Charity, still very weak and ill after her recent\nconfinement, had been unable to rise from her bed; Françoise, being\nwithout assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw her in\nthe back-kitchen which opened on to the courtyard, in process of killing a\nchicken; by its desperate and quite natural resistance, which Françoise,\nbeside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat beneath the\near, accompanied with shrill cries of “Filthy creature! Filthy creature!\"\nit made the saintly kindness and unction of our servant rather less\nprominent than it would do, next day at dinner, when it made its\nappearance in a skin gold-embroidered like a chasuble, and its precious\njuice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx. When it was dead\nFrançoise mopped up its streaming blood, in which, however, she did not\nlet her rancour drown, for she gave vent to another burst of rage, and,\ngazing down at the carcass of her enemy, uttered a final “Filthy\ncreature!”",
        "I crept out of the kitchen and upstairs, trembling all over; I could have\nprayed, then, for the instant dismissal of Françoise. But who would have\nbaked me such hot rolls, boiled me such fragrant coffee, and even–roasted\nme such chickens? And, as it happened, everyone else had already had to\nmake the same cowardly reckoning. For my aunt Léonie knew (though I was\nstill in ignorance of this) that Françoise, who, for her own daughter or\nfor her nephews, would have given her life without a murmur, shewed a\nsingular implacability in her dealings with the rest of the world. In\nspite of which my aunt still retained her, for, while conscious of her\ncruelty, she could appreciate her services. I began gradually to realise\nthat Françoise’s kindness, her compunction, the sum total of her virtues\nconcealed many of these back-kitchen tragedies, just as history reveals to\nus that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed as kneeling\nwith clasped hands in the windows of churches, were stained by oppression\nand bloodshed. I had taken note of the fact that, apart from her own\nkinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which\nincreased in direct ratio to the distance separating the sufferers from\nherself. The tears which flowed from her in torrents when she read of the\nmisfortunes of persons unknown to her, in a newspaper, were quickly\nstemmed once she had been able to form a more accurate mental picture of\nthe victims. One night, shortly after her confinement, the kitchen-maid\nwas seized with the most appalling pains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose\nand awakened Françoise, who, quite unmoved, declared that all the outcry\nwas mere malingering, that the girl wanted to ’play the mistress’ in the\nhouse.  The doctor, who had been afraid of some such attack, had left a\nmarker in a medical dictionary which we had, at the page on which the\nsymptoms were described, and had told us to turn up this passage, where we\nwould find the measures of ’first aid’ to be adopted. My mother sent\nFrançoise to fetch the book, warning her not to let the marker drop out.\nAn hour elapsed, and Françoise had not returned; my mother, supposing that\nshe had gone back to bed, grew vexed, and told me to go myself to the\nbookcase and fetch the volume. I did so, and there found Françoise who, in\nher curiosity to know what the marker indicated, had begun to read the\nclinical account of these after-pains, and was violently sobbing, now that\nit was a question of a type of illness with which she was not familiar. At\neach painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would exclaim: “Oh, oh,\nHoly Virgin, is it possible that God wishes any wretched human creature to\nsuffer so? Oh, the poor girl!”",
        "But when I had called her, and she had returned to the bedside of Giotto’s\nCharity, her tears at once ceased to flow; she could find no stimulus for\nthat pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she very well knew,\nhaving been moved to it often enough by the perusal of newspapers; nor any\nother pleasure of the same kind in her sense of weariness and irritation\nat being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night for the\nkitchen-maid; so that at the sight of those very sufferings, the printed\naccount of which had moved her to tears, she had nothing to offer but\nill-tempered mutterings, mingled with bitter sarcasm, saying, when she\nthought that we had gone out of earshot: “Well, she need never have done\nwhat she must have done to bring all this about! She found that pleasant\nenough, I dare say! She had better not put on any airs now. All the same,\nhe must have been a god-forsaken young man to go after that. Dear, dear,\nit’s just as they used to say in my poor mother’s country:",
        "  Snaps and snails and puppy-dogs’ tails,\n    And dirty sluts in plenty,\n  Smell sweeter than roses in young men’s noses\n    When the heart is one-and-twenty.”",
        "Although, when her grandson had a slight cold in his head, she would Bet\noff at night, even if she were ill also, instead of going to bed, to see\nwhether he had everything that he wanted, covering ten miles on foot\nbefore daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work, this same love for\nher own people, and her desire to establish the future greatness of her\nhouse on a solid foundation reacted, in her policy with regard to the\nother servants, in one unvarying maxim, which was never to let any of them\nset foot in my aunt’s room; indeed she shewed a sort of pride in not\nallowing anyone else to come near my aunt, preferring, when she herself\nwas ill, to get out of bed and to administer the Vichy water in person,\nrather than to concede to the kitchen-maid the right of entry into her\nmistress’s presence.  There is a species of hymenoptera, observed by\nFabre, the burrowing wasp, which in order to provide a supply of fresh\nmeat for her offspring after her own decease, calls in the science of\nanatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive cruelty, and, having\nmade a collection of weevils and spiders, proceeds with marvellous\nknowledge and skill to pierce the nerve-centre on which their power of\nlocomotion (but none of their other vital functions) depends, so that the\nparalysed insect, beside which her egg is laid, will furnish the larva,\nwhen it is hatched, with a tamed and inoffensive quarry, incapable either\nof flight or of resistance, but perfectly fresh for the larder: in the\nsame way Françoise had adopted, to minister to her permanent and\nunfaltering resolution to render the house uninhabitable to any other\nservant, a series of crafty and pitiless stratagems.  Many years later we\ndiscovered that, if we had been fed on asparagus day after day throughout\nthat whole season, it was because the smell of the plants gave the poor\nkitchen-maid, who had to prepare them, such violent attacks of asthma that\nshe was finally obliged to leave my aunt’s service.",
        "Alas! we had definitely to alter our opinion of M. Legrandin. On one-of\nthe Sundays following our meeting with him on the Pont-Vieux, after which\nmy father had been forced to confess himself mistaken, as mass drew to an\nend, and, with the sunshine and the noise of the outer world, something\nelse invaded the church, an atmosphere so far from sacred that Mme.\nGoupil, Mme.  Percepied (all those, in fact, who a moment ago, when I\narrived a little late, had been sitting motionless, their eyes fixed on\ntheir prayer-books; who, I might even have thought, had not seen me come\nin, had not their feet moved slightly to push away the little\nkneeling-desk which was preventing me from getting to my chair) began in\nloud voices to discuss with us all manner of utterly mundane topics, as\nthough we were already outside in the Square, we saw, standing on the\nsun-baked steps of the porch, dominating the many-coloured tumult of the\nmarket, Legrandin himself, whom the husband of the lady we had seen with\nhim, on the previous occasion, was just going to introduce to the wife of\nanother large landed proprietor of the district. Legrandin’s face shewed\nan extraordinary zeal and animation; he made a profound bow, with a\nsubsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a\nposition behind its starting-point, a gesture in which he must have been\ntrained by the husband of his sister, Mme. de Cambremer. This rapid\nrecovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over Legrandin’s\nhips, which I had not supposed to be so fleshy; I cannot say why, but this\nundulation of pure matter, this wholly carnal fluency, with not the least\nhint in it of spiritual significance, this wave lashed to a fury by the\nwind of an assiduity, an obsequiousness of the basest sort, awoke my mind\nsuddenly to the possibility of a Legrandin altogether different from the\none whom we knew. The lady gave him some message for her coachman, and\nwhile he was stepping down to her carriage the impression of joy, timid\nand devout, which the introduction had stamped there, still lingered on\nhis face. Carried away in a sort of dream, he smiled, then he began to\nhurry back towards the lady; he was walking faster than usual, and his\nshoulders swayed backwards and forwards, right and left, in the most\nabsurd fashion; altogether he looked, so utterly had he abandoned himself\nto it, ignoring all other considerations, as though he were the lifeless\nand wire-pulled puppet of his own happiness. Meanwhile we were coming out\nthrough the porch; we were passing close beside him; he was too well bred\nto turn his head away; but he fixed his eyes, which had suddenly changed\nto those of a seer, lost in the profundity of his vision, on so distant a\npoint of the horizon that he could not see us, and so had not to\nacknowledge our presence.  His face emerged, still with an air of\ninnocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked as though\nconscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself, and plunged into\nsurroundings of a detested splendour.  And a spotted necktie, stirred by\nthe breezes of the Square, continued to float in front of Legrandin, like\nthe standard of his proud isolation, of his noble independence. Just as we\nreached the house my mother discovered that we had forgotten the\n’Saint-Honoré,’ and asked my father to go back with me and tell them to\nsend it up at once. Near the church we met Legrandin, coming towards us\nwith the same lady, whom he was escorting to her carriage. He brushed past\nus, and did not interrupt what he was saying to her, but gave us, out of\nthe corner of his blue eye, a little sign, which began and ended, so to\nspeak, inside his eyelids, and as it did not involve the least movement of\nhis facial muscles, managed to pass quite unperceived by the lady; but,\nstriving to compensate by the intensity of his feelings for the somewhat\nrestricted field in which they had to find expression, he made that blue\nchink, which was set apart for us, sparkle with all the animation of\ncordiality, which went far beyond mere playfulness, and almost touched the\nborder-line of roguery; he subtilised the refinements of good-fellowship\ninto a wink of connivance, a hint, a hidden meaning, a secret\nunderstanding, all the mysteries of complicity in a plot, and finally\nexalted his assurances of friendship to the level of protestations of\naffection, even of a declaration of love, lighting up for us, and for us\nalone, with a secret and languid flame invisible by the great lady upon\nhis other side, an enamoured pupil in a countenance of ice.",
        "Only the day before he had asked my parents to send me to dine with him on\nthis same Sunday evening. “Come and bear your aged friend company,” he had\nsaid to me. “Like the nosegay which a traveller sends us from some land to\nwhich we shall never go again, come and let me breathe from the far\ncountry of your adolescence the scent of those flowers of spring among\nwhich I also used to wander, many years ago. Come with the primrose, with\nthe canon’s beard, with the gold-cup; come with the stone-crop, whereof\nare posies made, pledges of love, in the Balzacian flora, come with that\nflower of the Resurrection morning, the Easter daisy, come with the\nsnowballs of the guelder-rose, which begin to embalm with their fragrance\nthe alleys of your great-aunt’s garden ere the last snows of Lent are\nmelted from its soil. Come with the glorious silken raiment of the lily,\napparel fit for Solomon, and with the many-coloured enamel of the pansies,\nbut come, above all, with the spring breeze, still cooled by the last\nfrosts of wirier, wafting apart, for the two butterflies’ sake, that have\nwaited outside all morning, the closed portals of the first Jerusalem\nrose.”",
        "The question was raised at home whether, all things considered, I ought\nstill to be sent to dine with M. Legrandin. But my grandmother refused to\nbelieve that he could have been impolite.",
        "“You admit yourself that he appears at church there, quite simply dressed,\nand all that; he hardly looks like a man of fashion.” She added that; in\nany event, even if, at the worst, he had been intentionally rude, it was\nfar better for us to pretend that we had noticed nothing. And indeed my\nfather himself, though more annoyed than any of us by the attitude which\nLegrandin had adopted, may still have held in reserve a final uncertainty\nas to its true meaning. It was like every attitude or action which reveals\na man’s deep and hidden character; they bear no relation to what he has\npreviously said, and we cannot confirm our suspicions by the culprit’s\nevidence, for he will admit nothing; we are reduced to the evidence of our\nown senses, and we ask ourselves, in the face of this detached and\nincoherent fragment of recollection, whether indeed our senses have not\nbeen the victims of a hallucination; with the result that such attitudes,\nand these alone are of importance in indicating character, are the most\napt to leave us in perplexity.",
        "I dined with Legrandin on the terrace of his house, by moonlight. “There\nis a charming quality, is there not,” he said to me, “in this silence; for\nhearts that are wounded, as mine is, a novelist, whom you will read in\ntime to come, claims that there is no remedy but silence and shadow. And\nsee you this, my boy, there comes in all lives a time, towards which you\nstill have far to go, when the weary eyes can endure but one kind of\nlight, the light which a fine evening like this prepares for us in the\nstillroom of darkness, when the ears can listen to no music save what the\nmoonlight breathes through the flute of silence.”",
        "I could hear what M. Legrandin was saying; like everything that he said,\nit sounded attractive; but I was disturbed by the memory of a lady whom I\nhad seen recently for the first time; and thinking, now that I knew that\nLegrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local aristocracy,\nthat perhaps she also was among his acquaintance, I summoned up all my\ncourage and said to him: “Tell me, sir, do you, by any chance, know the\nlady–the ladies of Guermantes?” and I felt glad because, in pronouncing\nthe name, I had secured a sort of power over it, by the mere act of\ndrawing it up out of my dreams and giving it an objective existence in the\nworld of spoken things.",
        "But, at the sound of the word Guermantes, I saw in the middle of each of\nour friend’s blue eyes a little brown dimple appear, as though they had\nbeen stabbed by some invisible pin-point, while the rest of his pupils,\nreacting from the shock, received and secreted the azure overflow. His\nfringed eyelids darkened, and drooped. His mouth, which had been stiffened\nand seared with bitter lines, was the first to recover, and smiled, while\nhis eyes still seemed full of pain, like the eyes of a good-looking martyr\nwhose body bristles with arrows.",
        "“No, I do not know them,” he said, but instead of uttering so simple a\npiece of information, a reply in which there was so little that could\nastonish me, in the natural and conversational tone which would have\nbefitted it, he recited it with a separate stress upon each word, leaning\nforward, bowing his head, with at once the vehemence which a man gives, so\nas to be believed, to a highly improbable statement (as though the fact\nthat he did not know the Guermantes could be due only to some strange\naccident of fortune) and with the emphasis of a man who, finding himself\nunable to keep silence about what is to him a painful situation, chooses\nto proclaim it aloud, so as to convince his hearers that the confession he\nis making is one that causes him no embarrassment, but is easy, agreeable,\nspontaneous, that the situation in question, in this case the absence of\nrelations with the Guermantes family, might very well have been not forced\nupon, but actually designed by Legrandin himself, might arise from some\nfamily tradition, some moral principle or mystical vow which expressly\nforbade his seeking their society.",
        "“No,” he resumed, explaining by his words the tone in which they were\nuttered. “No, I do not know them; I have never wished to know them; I have\nalways made a point of preserving complete independence; at heart, as you\nknow, I am a bit of a Radical. People are always coming to me about it,\ntelling me I am mistaken in not going to Guermantes, that I make myself\nseem ill-bred, uncivilised, an old bear. But that’s not the sort of\nreputation that can frighten me; it’s too true! In my heart of hearts I\ncare for nothing in the world now but a few churches, books–two or three,\npictures–rather more, perhaps, and the light of the moon when the fresh\nbreeze of youth (such as yours) wafts to my nostrils the scent of gardens\nwhose flowers my old eyes are not sharp enough, now, to distinguish.”",
        "I did not understand very clearly why, in order to refrain from going to\nthe houses of people whom one did not know, it should be necessary to\ncling to one’s independence, nor how that could give one the appearance of\na savage or a bear. But what I did understand was this, that Legrandin was\nnot altogether truthful when he said that he cared only for churches,\nmoonlight, and youth; he cared also, he cared a very great deal, for\npeople who lived in country houses, and would be so much afraid, when in\ntheir company, of incurring their displeasure that he would never dare to\nlet them see that he numbered, as well, among his friends middle-class\npeople, the families of solicitors and stockbrokers, preferring, if the\ntruth must be known, that it should be revealed in his absence, when he\nwas out of earshot, that judgment should go against him (if so it must) by\ndefault: in a word, he was a snob. Of course he would never have admitted\nall or any of this in the poetical language which my family and I so much\nadmired.  And if I asked him, “Do you know the Guermantes family?\"\nLegrandin the talker would reply, “No, I have never cared to know them.\"\nBut unfortunately the talker was now subordinated to another Legrandin,\nwhom he kept carefully hidden in his breast, whom he would never\nconsciously exhibit, because this other could tell stories about our own\nLegrandin and about his snobbishness which would have ruined his\nreputation for ever; and this other Legrandin had replied to me already in\nthat wounded look, that stiffened smile, the undue gravity of his tone in\nuttering those few words, in the thousand arrows by which our own\nLegrandin had instantaneously been stabbed and sickened, like a Saint\nSebastian of snobbery:",
        "“Oh, how you hurt me! No, I do not know the Guermantes family. Do not\nremind me of the great sorrow of my life.” And since this other, this\nirrepressible, dominant, despotic Legrandin, if he lacked our Legrandin’s\ncharming vocabulary, shewed an infinitely greater promptness in expressing\nhimself, by means of what are called ’reflexes,’ it followed that, when\nLegrandin the talker attempted to silence him, he would already have\nspoken, and it would be useless for our friend to deplore the bad\nimpression which the revelations of his alter ego must have caused,\nsince he could do no more now than endeavour to mitigate them.",
        "This was not to say that M. Legrandin was anything but sincere when he\ninveighed against snobs. He could not (from his own knowledge, at least)\nbe aware that he was one also, since it is only with the passions of\nothers that we are ever really familiar, and what we come to find out\nabout our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us. Upon\nourselves they react but indirectly, through our imagination, which\nsubstitutes for our actual, primary motives other, secondary motives, less\nstark and therefore more decent. Never had Legrandin’s snobbishness\nimpelled him to make a habit of visiting a duchess as such. Instead, it\nwould set his imagination to make that duchess appear, in Legrandin’s\neyes, endowed with all the graces. He would be drawn towards the duchess,\nassuring himself the while that he was yielding to the attractions of her\nmind, and her other virtues, which the vile race of snobs could never\nunderstand.  Only his fellow-snobs knew that he was of their number, for,\nowing to their inability to appreciate the intervening efforts of his\nimagination, they saw in close juxtaposition the social activities of\nLegrandin and their primary cause.",
        "At home, meanwhile, we had no longer any illusions as to M. Legrandin, and\nour relations with him had become much more distant. Mamma would be\ngreatly delighted whenever she caught him red-handed in the sin, which he\ncontinued to call the unpardonable sin, of snobbery. As for my father, he\nfound it difficult to take Legrandin’s airs in so light, in so detached a\nspirit; and when there was some talk, one year, of sending me to spend the\nlong summer holidays at Balbec with my grandmother, he said: “I must, most\ncertainly, tell Legrandin that you are going to Balbec, to see whether he\nwill offer you an introduction to his sister. He probably doesn’t remember\ntelling us that she lived within a mile of the place.”",
        "My grandmother, who held that, when one went to the seaside, one ought to\nbe on the beach from morning to night, to taste the salt breezes, and that\none should not know anyone in the place, because calls and parties and\nexcursions were so much time stolen from what belonged, by rights, to the\nsea-air, begged him on no account to speak to Legrandin of our plans; for\nalready, in her mind’s eye, she could see his sister, Mme. de Cambremer,\nalighting from her carriage at the door of our hotel just as we were on\nthe point of going out fishing, and obliging us to remain indoors all\nafternoon to entertain her. But Mamma laughed her fears to scorn, for she\nherself felt that the danger was not so threatening, and that Legrandin\nwould shew no undue anxiety to make us acquainted with his sister. And, as\nit happened, there was no need for any of us to introduce the subject of\nBalbec, for it was Legrandin himself who, without the least suspicion that\nwe had ever had any intention of visiting those parts, walked into the\ntrap uninvited one evening, when we met him strolling on the banks of the\nVivonne.",
        "“There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are\nvery beautiful, are they not, my friend?” he said to my father.\n\"Especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric, a cineraria\nblue, which it is surprising to see in the sky. And that little pink cloud\nthere, has it not just the tint of some flower, a carnation or hydrangea?\nNowhere, perhaps, except on the shores of the English Channel, where\nNormandy merges into Brittany, have I been able to find such copious\nexamples of what you might call a vegetable kingdom in the clouds. Down\nthere, close to Balbec, among all those places which are still so\nuncivilised, there is a little bay, charmingly quiet, where the sunsets of\nthe Auge Valley, those red-and-gold sunsets (which, all the same, I am\nvery far from despising) seem commonplace and insignificant; for in that\nmoist and gentle atmosphere these heavenly flower-beds will break into\nblossom, in a few moments, in the evenings, incomparably lovely, and often\nlasting for hours before they fade. Others shed their leaves at once, and\nthen it is more beautiful still to see the sky strewn with the scattering\nof their innumerable petals, sulphurous yellow and rosy red. In that bay,\nwhich they call the Opal Bay, the golden sands appear more charming still\nfrom being fastened, like fair Andromeda, to those terrible rocks of the\nsurrounding coast, to that funereal shore, famed for the number of its\nwrecks, where every winter many a brave vessel falls a victim to the\nperils of the sea. Balbec! the oldest bone in the geological skeleton that\nunderlies our soil, the true Armor, the sea, the land’s end, the accursed\nregion which Anatole France–an enchanter whose works our young friend\nought to read–has so well depicted, beneath its eternal fogs, as though\nit were indeed the land of the Cimmerians in the Odyssey. Balbec; yes,\nthey are building hotels there now, superimposing them upon its ancient\nand charming soil, which they are powerless to alter; how delightful it\nis, down there, to be able to step out at once into regions so primitive\nand so entrancing.”",
        "“Indeed! And do you know anyone at Balbec?” inquired my father.  “This\nyoung man is just going to spend a couple of months there with his\ngrandmother, and my wife too, perhaps.”",
        "Legrandin, taken unawares by the question at a moment when he was looking\ndirectly at my father, was unable to turn aside his gaze, and so\nconcentrated it with steadily increasing intensity–smiling mournfully the\nwhile–upon the eyes of his questioner, with an air of friendliness and\nfrankness and of not being afraid to look him in the face, until he seemed\nto have penetrated my father’s skull, as it had been a ball of glass, and\nto be seeing, at the moment, a long way beyond and behind it, a brightly\ncoloured cloud, which provided him with a mental alibi, and would enable\nhim to establish the theory that, just when he was being asked whether he\nknew anyone at Balbec, he had been thinking of something else, and so had\nnot heard the question. As a rule these tactics make the questioner\nproceed to ask, “Why, what are you thinking about?” But my father,\ninquisitive, annoyed, and cruel, repeated: “Have you friends, then, in\nthat neighbourhood, that you know Balbec so well?”",
        "In a final and desperate effort the smiling gaze of Legrandin struggled to\nthe extreme limits of its tenderness, vagueness, candour, and distraction;\nthen feeling, no doubt, that there was nothing left for it now but to\nanswer, he said to us: “I have friends all the world over, wherever there\nare companies of trees, stricken but not defeated, which have come\ntogether to offer a common supplication, with pathetic obstinacy, to an\ninclement sky which has no mercy upon them.”",
        "“That is not quite what I meant,” interrupted my father, obstinate as a\ntree and merciless as the sky. “I asked you, in case anything should\nhappen to my mother-in-law and she wanted to feel that she was not all\nalone down there, at the ends of the earth, whether you knew any of the\npeople.”",
        "“There as elsewhere, I know everyone and I know no one,” replied\nLegrandin, who was by no means ready yet to surrender; “places I know\nwell, people very slightly. But, down there, the places themselves seem to\nme just like people, rare and wonderful people, of a delicate quality\nwhich would have been corrupted and ruined by the gift of life. Perhaps it\nis a castle which you encounter upon the cliff’s edge; standing there by\nthe roadside, where it has halted to contemplate its sorrows before an\nevening sky, still rosy, through which a golden moon is climbing; while\nthe fishing-boats, homeward bound, creasing the watered silk of the\nChannel, hoist its pennant at their mastheads and carry its colours. Or\nperhaps it is a simple dwelling-house that stands alone, ugly, if\nanything, timid-seeming but full of romance, hiding from every eye some\nimperishable secret of happiness and disenchantment. That land which knows\nnot truth,” he continued with Machiavellian subtlety, “that land of\ninfinite fiction makes bad reading for any boy; and is certainly not what\nI should choose or recommend for my young friend here, who is already so\nmuch inclined to melancholy, for a heart already predisposed to receive\nits impressions.  Climates that breathe amorous secrets and futile regrets\nmay agree with an old and disillusioned man like myself; but they must\nalways prove fatal to a temperament which is still unformed. Believe me,\"\nhe went on with emphasis, “the waters of that bay–more Breton than\nNorman–may exert a sedative influence, though even that is of\nquestionable value, upon a heart which, like mine, is no longer unbroken,\na heart for whose wounds there is no longer anything to compensate. But at\nyour age, my boy, those waters are contra-indicated.... Good night to you,\nneighbours,” he added, moving away from us with that evasive abruptness to\nwhich we were accustomed; and then, turning towards us, with a\nphysicianly finger raised in warning, he resumed the consultation: “No\nBalbec before you are fifty!” he called out to me, “and even then it must\ndepend on the state of the heart.”",
        "My father spoke to him of it again, as often as we met him, and tortured\nhim with questions, but it was labour in vain: like that scholarly\nswindler who devoted to the fabrication of forged palimpsests a wealth of\nskill and knowledge and industry the hundredth part of which would have\nsufficed to establish him in a more lucrative–but an honourable\noccupation, M. Legrandin, had we insisted further, would in the end have\nconstructed a whole system of ethics, and a celestial geography of Lower\nNormandy, sooner than admit to us that, within a mile of Balbec, his own\nsister was living in her own house; sooner than find himself obliged to\noffer us a letter of introduction, the prospect of which would never have\ninspired him with such terror had he been absolutely certain–as, from his\nknowledge of my grandmother’s character, he really ought to have been\ncertain–that in no circumstances whatsoever would we have dreamed of\nmaking use of it.",
        "We used always to return from our walks in good time to pay aunt Léonie a\nvisit before dinner. In the first weeks of our Combray holidays, when the\ndays ended early, we would still be able to see, as we turned into the Rue\ndu Saint-Esprit, a reflection of the western sky from the windows of the\nhouse and a band of purple at the foot of the Calvary, which was mirrored\nfurther on in the pond; a fiery glow which, accompanied often by a cold\nthat burned and stung, would associate itself in my mind with the glow of\nthe fire over which, at that very moment, was roasting the chicken that\nwas to furnish me, in place of the poetic pleasure I had found in my walk,\nwith the sensual pleasures of good feeding, warmth and rest.  But in\nsummer, when we came back to the house, the sun would not have set; and\nwhile we were upstairs paying our visit to aunt Léonie its rays, sinking\nuntil they touched and lay along her window-sill, would there be caught\nand held by the large inner curtains and the bands which tied them back to\nthe wall, and split and scattered and filtered; and then, at last, would\nfall upon and inlay with tiny flakes of gold the lemonwood of her\nchest-of-drawers, illuminating the room in their passage with the same\ndelicate, slanting, shadowed beams that fall among the boles of forest\ntrees. But on some days, though very rarely, the chest-of-drawers would\nlong since have shed its momentary adornments, there would no longer, as\nwe turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, be any reflection from the western\nsky burning along the line of window-panes; the pond beneath the Calvary\nwould have lost its fiery glow, sometimes indeed had changed already to an\nopalescent pallor, while a long ribbon of moonlight, bent and broken and\nbroadened by every ripple upon the water’s surface, would be lying across\nit, from end to end. Then, as we drew near the house, we would make out a\nfigure standing upon the doorstep, and Mamma would say to me: “Good\nheavens! There is Françoise looking out for us; your aunt must be anxious;\nthat means we are late.”",
        "And without wasting time by stopping to take off our ’things’ we would fly\nupstairs to my aunt Léonie’s room to reassure her, to prove to her by our\nbodily presence that all her gloomy imaginings were false, that, on the\ncontrary, nothing had happened to us, but that we had gone the ’Guermantes\nway,’ and, good lord, when one took that walk, my aunt knew well\nenough that one could never say at what time one would be home.",
        "“There, Françoise,” my aunt would say, “didn’t I tell you that they must\nhave gone the Guermantes way? Good gracious! They must be hungry! And your\nnice leg of mutton will be quite dried up now, after all the hours it’s\nbeen waiting. What a time to come in! Well, and so you went the Guermantes\nway?”",
        "“But, Leonie, I supposed you knew,” Mamma would answer. “I thought that\nFrançoise had seen us go out by the little gate, through the\nkitchen-garden.”",
        "For there were, in the environs of Combray, two ’ways’ which we used to\ntake for our walks, and so diametrically opposed that we would actually\nleave the house by a different door, according to the way we had chosen:\nthe way towards Méséglise-la-Vineuse, which we called also ’Swann’s way,’\nbecause, to get there, one had to pass along the boundary of M. Swann’s\nestate, and the ’Guermantes way.’ Of Méséglise-la-Vineuse, to tell the\ntruth, I never knew anything more than the way there, and the strange\npeople who would come over on Sundays to take the air in Combray, people\nwhom, this time, neither my aunt nor any of us would ’know at all,’ and\nwhom we would therefore assume to be ’people who must have come over from\nMéséglise.’ As for Guermantes, I was to know it well enough one day, but\nthat day had still to come; and, during the whole of my boyhood, if\nMéséglise was to me something as inaccessible as the horizon, which\nremained hidden from sight, however far one went, by the folds of a\ncountry which no longer bore the least resemblance to the country round\nCombray; Guermantes, on the other hand, meant no more than the ultimate\ngoal, ideal rather than real, of the ’Guermantes way,’ a sort of abstract\ngeographical term like the North Pole or the Equator. And so to ’take the\nGuermantes way’ in order to get to Méséglise, or vice versa, would have\nseemed to me as nonsensical a proceeding as to turn to the east in order\nto reach the west. Since my father used always to speak of the ’Méséglise\nway’ as comprising the finest view of a plain that he knew anywhere, and\nof the ’Guermantes way’ as typical of river scenery, I had invested each\nof them, by conceiving them in this way as two distinct entities, with\nthat cohesion, that unity which belongs only to the figments of the mind;\nthe smallest detail of either of them appeared to me as a precious thing,\nwhich exhibited the special excellence of the whole, while, immediately\nbeside them, in the first stages of our walk, before we had reached the\nsacred soil of one or the other, the purely material roads, at definite\npoints on which they were set down as the ideal view over a plain and the\nideal scenery of a river, were no more worth the trouble of looking at\nthem than, to a keen playgoer and lover of dramatic art, are the little\nstreets which may happen to run past the walls of a theatre. But, above\nall, I set between them, far more distinctly than the mere distance in\nmiles and yards and inches which separated one from the other, the\ndistance that there was between the two parts of my brain in which I used\nto think of them, one of those distances of the mind which time serves\nonly to lengthen, which separate things irremediably from one another,\nkeeping them for ever upon different planes. And this distinction was\nrendered still more absolute because the habit we had of never going both\nways on the same day, or in the course of the same walk, but the\n’Méséglise way’ one time and the ’Guermantes way’ another, shut them up,\nso to speak, far apart and unaware of each other’s existence, in the\nsealed vessels–between which there could be no communication–of separate\nafternoons.",
        "When we had decided to go the ’Méséglise way’ we would start (without\nundue haste, and even if the sky were clouded over, since the walk was not\nvery long, and did not take us too far from home), as though we were not\ngoing anywhere in particular, by the front-door of my aunt’s house, which\nopened on to the Rue du Saint-Esprit. We would be greeted by the gunsmith,\nwe would drop our letters into the box, we would tell Théodore, from\nFrançoise, as we passed, that she had run out of oil or coffee, and we\nwould leave the town by the road which ran along the white fence of M.\nSwann’s park. Before reaching it we would be met on our way by the scent\nof his lilac-trees, come out to welcome strangers. Out of the fresh little\ngreen hearts of their foliage the lilacs raised inquisitively over the\nfence of the park their plumes of white or purple blossom, which glowed,\neven in the shade, with the sunlight in which they had been bathed. Some\nof them, half-concealed by the little tiled house, called the Archers’\nLodge, in which Swann’s keeper lived, overtopped its gothic gable with\ntheir rosy minaret.  The nymphs of spring would have seemed coarse and\nvulgar in comparison with these young houris, who retained, in this French\ngarden, the pure and vivid colouring of a Persian miniature. Despite my\ndesire to throw my arms about their pliant forms and to draw down towards\nme the starry locks that crowned their fragrant heads, we would pass them\nby without stopping, for my parents had ceased to visit Tansonville since\nSwann’s marriage, and, so as not to appear to be looking into his park, we\nwould, instead of taking the road which ran beside its boundary and then\nclimbed straight up to the open fields, choose another way, which led in\nthe same direction, but circuitously, and brought us out rather too far\nfrom home.",
        "One day my grandfather said to my ’father: “Don’t you remember Swann’s\ntelling us yesterday that his wife and daughter had gone off to Rheims and\nthat he was taking the opportunity of spending a day or two in Paris? We\nmight go along by the park, since the ladies are not at home; that will\nmake it a little shorter.”",
        "We stopped for a moment by the fence. Lilac-time was nearly over; some of\nthe trees still thrust aloft, in tall purple chandeliers, their tiny balls\nof blossom, but in many places among their foliage where, only a week\nbefore, they had still been breaking in waves of fragrant foam, these were\nnow spent and shrivelled and discoloured, a hollow scum, dry and\nscentless. My grandfather pointed out to my father in what respects the\nappearance of the place was still the same, and how far it had altered\nsince the walk that he had taken with old M. Swann, on the day of his\nwife’s death; and he seized the opportunity to tell us, once again, the\nstory of that walk.",
        "In front of us a path bordered with nasturtiums rose in the full glare of\nthe sun towards the house. But to our right the park stretched away into\nthe distance, on level ground. Overshadowed by the tall trees which stood\nclose around it, an ’ornamental water’ had been constructed by Swann’s\nparents but, even in his most artificial creations, nature is the material\nupon which man has to work; certain spots will persist in remaining\nsurrounded by the vassals of their own especial sovereignty, and will\nraise their immemorial standards among all the ’laid-out’ scenery of a\npark, just as they would have done far from any human interference, in a\nsolitude which must everywhere return to engulf them, springing up out of\nthe necessities of their exposed position, and superimposing itself upon\nthe work of man’s hands. And so it was that, at the foot of the path which\nled down to this artificial lake, there might be seen, in its two tiers\nwoven of trailing forget-me-nots below and of periwinkle flowers above,\nthe natural, delicate, blue garland which binds the luminous, shadowed\nbrows of water-nymphs; while the iris, its swords sweeping every way in\nregal profusion, stretched out over agrimony and water-growing king-cups\nthe lilied sceptres, tattered glories of yellow and purple, of the kingdom\nof the lake.",
        "The absence of Mlle. Swann, which–since it preserved me from the terrible\nrisk of seeing her appear on one of the paths, and of being identified and\nscorned by this so privileged little girl who had Bergotte for a friend\nand used to go with him to visit cathedrals–made the exploration of\nTansonville, now for the first time permitted me, a matter of\nindifference to myself, seemed however to invest the property, in my\ngrandfather’s and father’s eyes, with a fresh and transient charm, and\n(like an entirely cloudless sky when one is going mountaineering) to make\nthe day extraordinarily propitious for a walk in this direction; I should\nhave liked to see their reckoning proved false, to see, by a miracle,\nMlle. Swann appear, with her father, so close to us that we should not\nhave time to escape, and should therefore be obliged to make her\nacquaintance. And so, when I suddenly noticed a straw basket lying\nforgotten on the grass by the side of a line whose float was bobbing in\nthe water, I made a great effort to keep my father and grandfather looking\nin another direction, away from this sign that she might, after all, be in\nresidence. Still, as Swann had told us that he ought not, really, to go\naway just then, as he had some people staying in the house, the line might\nequally belong to one of these guests. Not a footstep was to be heard on\nany of the paths. Somewhere in one of the tall trees, making a stage in\nits height, an invisible bird, desperately attempting to make the day seem\nshorter, was exploring with a long, continuous note the solitude that\npressed it on every side, but it received at once so unanimous an answer,\nso powerful a repercussion of silence and of immobility that, one would\nhave said, it had arrested for all eternity the moment which it had been\ntrying to make pass more quickly. The sunlight fell so implacably from a\nfixed sky that one was naturally inclined to slip away out of the reach of\nits attentions, and even the slumbering water, whose repose was\nperpetually being invaded by the insects that swarmed above its surface,\nwhile it dreamed, no doubt, of some imaginary maelstrom, intensified the\nuneasiness which the sight of that floating cork had wrought in me, by\nappearing to draw it at full speed across the silent reaches of a mirrored\nfirmament; now almost vertical, it seemed on the point of plunging down\nout of sight, and I had begun to ask myself whether, setting aside the\nlonging and the terror that I had of making her acquaintance, it was not\nactually my duty to warn Mlle. Swann that the fish was biting–when I was\nobliged to run after my father and grandfather, who were calling me, and\nwere surprised that I had not followed them along the little path,\nclimbing up hill towards the open fields, into which they had already\nturned.  I found the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of\nhawthorn-blossom.  The hedge resembled a series of chapels, whose walls\nwere no longer visible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped\nupon their altars; while underneath, the sun cast a square of light upon\nthe ground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window; the\nscent that swept out over me from them was as rich, and as circumscribed\nin its range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and the\nflowers, themselves adorned also, held out each its little bunch of\nglittering stamens with an air of inattention, fine, radiating ’nerves’ in\nthe flamboyant style of architecture, like those which, in church, framed\nthe stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the\nwindows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like\nstrawberry-beds in spring. How simple and rustic, in comparison with\nthese, would seem the dog-roses which, in a few weeks’ time, would be\nclimbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun, dressed in the\nsmooth silk of their blushing pink bodices, which would be undone and\nscattered by the first breath of wind.",
        "But it was in vain that I lingered before the hawthorns, to breathe in, to\nmarshal! before my mind (which knew not what to make of it), to lose in\norder to rediscover their invisible and unchanging odour, to absorb myself\nin the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with the\nlight-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as certain\nintervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same\ncharm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting me delve into it\nany more deeply, like those melodies which one can play over a hundred\ntimes in succession without coming any nearer to their secret. I turned\naway from them for a moment so as to be able to return to them with\nrenewed strength.  My eyes followed up the slope which, outside the hedge,\nrose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its\nfellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind, and decorated\nthe ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a\ntapestry, in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme\nwhich appears triumphant in the panel itself; infrequent still, spaced\napart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a\nvillage, they betokened to me the vast expanse of waving corn beneath the\nfleecy clouds, and the sight of a single poppy hoisting upon its slender\nrigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign, over the buoy\nof rich black earth from which it sprang, made my heart beat as does a\nwayfarer’s when he perceives, upon some low-lying ground, an old and\nbroken boat which is being caulked and made seaworthy, and cries out,\nalthough he has not yet caught sight of it, “The Sea!”",
        "And then I returned to my hawthorns, and stood before them as one stands\nbefore those masterpieces of painting which, one imagines, one will be\nbetter able to ’take in’ when one has looked away, for a moment, at\nsomething else; but in vain did I shape my fingers into a frame, so as to\nhave nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes; the sentiment which they\naroused in me remained obscure and vague, struggling and failing to free\nitself, to float across and become one with the flowers. They themselves\noffered me no enlightenment, and I could not call upon any other flowers\nto satisfy this mysterious longing. And then, inspiring me with that\nrapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite painter quite\ndifferent from any of those that we already know, or, better still, when\nsome one has taken us and set us down in front of a picture of which we\nhave hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch, or when a piece of\nmusic which we have heard played over on the piano bursts out again in our\nears with all the splendour and fullness of an orchestra, my grandfather\ncalled me to him, and, pointing to the hedge of Tansonville, said: “You\nare fond of hawthorns; just look at this pink one; isn’t it pretty?”",
        "And it was indeed a hawthorn, but one whose flowers were pink, and\nlovelier even than the white. It, too, was in holiday attire, for one of\nthose days which are the only true holidays, the holy days of religion,\nbecause they are not appointed by any capricious accident, as secular\nholidays are appointed, upon days which are not specially ordained for\nsuch observances, which have nothing about them that is essentially\nfestal–but it was attired even more richly than the rest, for the flowers\nwhich clung to its branches, one above another, so thickly as to leave no\npart of the tree undecorated, like the tassels wreathed about the crook of\na rococo shepherdess, were every one of them ’in colour,’ and consequently\nof a superior quality, by the aesthetic standards of Combray, to the\n’plain,’ if one was to judge by the scale of prices at the ’stores’ in the\nSquare, or at Camus’s, where the most expensive biscuits were those whose\nsugar was pink. And for my own part I set a higher value on cream cheese\nwhen it was pink, when I had been allowed to tinge it with crushed\nstrawberries. And these flowers had chosen precisely the colour of some\nedible and delicious thing, or of some exquisite addition to one’s costume\nfor a great festival, which colours, inasmuch as they make plain the\nreason for their superiority, are those whose beauty is most evident to\nthe eyes of children, and for that reason must always seem more vivid and\nmore natural than any other tints, even after the child’s mind has\nrealised that they offer no gratification to the appetite, and have not\nbeen selected by the dressmaker. And, indeed, I had felt at once, as I had\nfelt before the white blossom, but now still more marvelling, that it was\nin no artificial manner, by no device of human construction, that the\nfestal intention of these flowers was revealed, but that it was Nature\nherself who had spontaneously expressed it (with the simplicity of a woman\nfrom a village shop, labouring at the decoration of a street altar for\nsome procession) by burying the bush in these little rosettes, almost too\nravishing in colour, this rustic ’pompadour.’ High up on the branches,\nlike so many of those tiny rose-trees, their pots concealed in jackets of\npaper lace, whose slender stems rise in a forest from the altar on the\ngreater festivals, a thousand buds were swelling and opening, paler in\ncolour, but each disclosing as it burst, as at the bottom of a cup of pink\nmarble, its blood-red stain, and suggesting even more strongly than the\nfull-blown flowers the special, irresistible quality of the hawthorn-tree,\nwhich, wherever it budded, wherever it was about to blossom, could bud and\nblossom in pink flowers alone. Taking its place in the hedge, but as\ndifferent from the rest as a young girl in holiday attire among a crowd of\ndowdy women in everyday clothes, who are staying at home, equipped and\nready for the ’Month of Mary,’ of which it seemed already to form a part,\nit shone and smiled in its cool, rosy garments, a Catholic bush indeed,\nand altogether delightful.",
        "The hedge allowed us a glimpse, inside the park, of an alley bordered with\njasmine, pansies, and verbenas, among which the stocks held open their\nfresh plump purses, of a pink as fragrant and as faded as old Spanish\nleather, while on the gravel-path a long watering-pipe, painted green,\ncoiling across the ground, poured, where its holes were, over the flowers\nwhose perfume those holes inhaled, a vertical and prismatic fan of\ninfinitesimal, rainbow-coloured drops. Suddenly I stood still, unable to\nmove, as happens when something appears that requires not only our eyes to\ntake it in, but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes possession\nof the whole of our being. A little girl, with fair, reddish hair, who\nappeared to be returning from a walk, and held a trowel in her hand, was\nlooking at us, raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish freckles.\nHer black eyes gleamed, and as I did not at that time know, and indeed\nhave never since learned how to reduce to its objective elements any\nstrong impression, since I had not, as they say, enough ’power of\nobservation’ to isolate the sense of their colour, for a long time\nafterwards, whenever I thought of her, the memory of those bright eyes\nwould at once present itself to me as a vivid azure, since her complexion\nwas fair; so much so that, perhaps, if her eyes had not been quite so\nblack–which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her–I\nshould not have been, as I was, especially enamoured of their imagined\nblue.",
        "I gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger\nfrom the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out,\npetrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture,\nbear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the\nbody; then (so frightened was I lest at any moment my grandfather and\nfather, catching sight of the girl, might tear me away from her, by making\nme run on in front of them) with another, an unconsciously appealing look,\nwhose object was to force her to pay attention to me, to see, to know me.\nShe cast a glance forwards and sideways, so as to take stock of my\ngrandfather and father, and doubtless the impression she formed of them\nwas that we were all absurd people, for she turned away with an\nindifferent and contemptuous air, withdrew herself so as to spare her face\nthe indignity of remaining within their field of vision; and while they,\ncontinuing to walk on without noticing her, had overtaken and passed me,\nshe allowed her eyes to wander, over the space that lay between us, in my\ndirection, without any particular expression, without appearing to have\nseen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden smile which I was unable to\ninterpret, according to the instruction I had received in the ways of good\nbreeding, save as a mark of infinite disgust; and her hand, at the same\ntime, sketched in the air an indelicate gesture, for which, when it was\naddressed in public to a person whom one did not know, the little\ndictionary of manners which I carried in my mind supplied only one\nmeaning, namely, a deliberate insult.",
        "“Gilberte, come along; what are you doing?” called out in a piercing tone\nof authority a lady in white, whom I had not seen until that moment,\nwhile, a little way beyond her, a gentleman in a suit of linen ’ducks,’\nwhom I did not know either, stared at me with eyes which seemed to be\nstarting from his head; the little girl’s smile abruptly faded, and,\nseizing her trowel, she made off without turning to look again hi my\ndirection, with an air of obedience, inscrutable and sly.",
        "And so was wafted to my ears the name of Gilberte, bestowed on me like a\ntalisman which might, perhaps, enable me some day to rediscover her whom\nits syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a\nmoment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. So it came to\nme, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and cool\nas the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating and\nirradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which it set\napart and isolated from all other air, with the mystery of the life of her\nwhom its syllables designated to the happy creatures that lived and walked\nand travelled in her company; unfolding through the arch of the pink\nhawthorn, which opened at the height of my shoulder, the quintessence of\ntheir familiarity–so exquisitely painful to myself–with her, and with\nall that unknown world of her existence, into which I should never\npenetrate.",
        "For a moment (while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: “Poor\nSwann, what a life they are leading him; fancy sending him away so that\nshe can be left alone with her Charlus–for that was Charlus: I recognised\nhim at once! And the child, too; at her age, to be mixed up in all that!”)\nthe impression left on me by the despotic tone in which Gilberte’s mother\nhad spoken to her, without her replying, by exhibiting her to me as being\nobliged to yield obedience to some one else, as not being indeed superior\nto the whole world, calmed my sufferings somewhat, revived some hope in\nme, and cooled the ardour of my love. But very soon that love surged up\nagain in me like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was endeavouring\nto rise to Gilberte’s level, or to draw her down to its own.  I loved her;\nI was sorry not to have had the time and the inspiration to insult her, to\ndo her some injury, to force her to keep some memory of me.  I knew her to\nbe so beautiful that I should have liked to be able to retrace my steps so\nas to shake my fist at her and shout, “I think you are hideous, grotesque;\nyou are utterly disgusting!” However, I walked away, carrying with me,\nthen and for ever afterwards, as the first illustration of a type of\nhappiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws\nof nature which it was impossible to transgress, the picture of a little\ngirl with reddish hair, and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks, who held\na trowel in her hand, and smiled as she directed towards me a long and\nsubtle and inexpressive stare. And already the charm with which her name,\nlike a cloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn\nthrough which she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to\nconquer, to cover, to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had any\nassociation: her grandparents, whom my own had been so unspeakably\nfortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even the\nmelancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elysées, where she lived in Paris.",
        "“Léonie,” said my grandfather on our return, “I wish we had had you with\nus this afternoon. You would never have known Tansonville. If I had had\nthe courage I would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used\nto like so much.” And so my grandfather told her the story of our walk,\neither just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope\nthat she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors.\nFor in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and, moreover,\nSwann’s visits had been the last that she had continued to receive, at a\ntime when she had already closed her doors to all the world. And just as,\nwhen he called, in these later days, to inquire for her (and she was still\nthe only person in our household whom he would ask to see), she would send\ndown to say that she was tired at the moment and resting, but that she\nwould be happy to see him another time, so, this evening, she said to my\ngrandfather, “Yes, some day when the weather is fine I shall go for a\ndrive as far as the gate of the park.” And in saying this she was quite\nsincere. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but the\nmere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength, which\nits fulfilment would have more than exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine\nweather made her a little more energetic, she would rise and put on her\nclothes; but before she had reached the outer room she would be ’tired’\nagain, and would insist on returning to her bed. The process which had\nbegun in her–and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of\nus–was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in\npreparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed\nwherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived\nfor one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends\nbound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year,\ncease to make, the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see\none another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate\nno more in this world. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that\nshe would not see Swann again, that she would never leave her own house\nany more, but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with\nall the more readiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to\nhave made it more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced\nupon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she\nwas able to measure daily, which, by making every action, every movement\n’tiring’ to her if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and\nsilence the blessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose.",
        "My aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge, but at all hours\nof the day I would ask the rest of my family whether she was not going to\ngo, whether she used not, at one time, to go often to Tansonville, trying\nto make them speak of Mile. Swann’s parents and grandparents, who appeared\nto me to be as great and glorious as gods. The name, which had for me\nbecome almost mythological, of Swann–when I talked with my family I would\ngrow sick with longing to hear them utter it; I dared not pronounce it\nmyself, but I would draw them into a discussion of matters which led\nnaturally to Gilberte and her family, in which she was involved, in\nspeaking of which I would feel myself not too remotely banished from her\ncompany; and I would suddenly force my father (by pretending, for\ninstance, to believe that my grandfather’s business had been in our family\nbefore his day, or that the hedge with the pink hawthorn which my aunt\nLéonie wished to visit was on common ground) to correct my statements, to\nsay, as though in opposition to me and of his own accord: “No, no, the\nbusiness belonged to Swann’s father, that hedge is part of Swann’s\npark.” And then I would be obliged to pause for breath; so stifling was\nthe pressure, upon that part of me where it was for ever inscribed, of\nthat name which, at the moment when I heard it, seemed to me fuller, more\nportentous than any other name, because it was burdened with the weight of\nall the occasions on which I had secretly uttered it in my mind. It caused\nme a pleasure which I was ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents,\nfor so great was it that to have procured it for me must have involved\nthem in an immensity of effort, and with no recompense, since for them\nthere was no pleasure in the sound. And so I would prudently turn the\nconversation. And by a scruple of conscience, also. All the singular\nseductions which I had stored up in the sound of that word Swann, I found\nagain as soon as it was uttered.  And then it occurred to me suddenly that\nmy parents could not fail to experience the same emotions, that they must\nfind themselves sharing my point of view, that they perceived in their\nturn, that they condoned, that they even embraced my visionary longings,\nand I was as wretched as though I had ravished and corrupted the innocence\nof their hearts.",
        "That year my family fixed the day of their return to Paris rather earlier\nthan usual. On the morning of our departure I had had my hair curled, to\nbe ready to face the photographer, had had a new hat carefully set upon my\nhead, and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket; a little later my\nmother, after searching everywhere for me, found me standing in tears on\nthat steep little hillside close to Tansonville, bidding a long farewell\nto my hawthorns, clasping their sharp branches to my bosom, and (like a\nprincess in a tragedy, oppressed by the weight of all her senseless\njewellery) with no gratitude towards the officious hand which had, in\ncurling those ringlets, been at pains to collect all my hair upon my\nforehead; trampling underfoot the curl-papers which I had torn from my\nhead, and my new hat with them. My mother was not at all moved by my\ntears, but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of my battered\nheadgear and my ruined jacket.  I did not, however, hear her. “Oh, my poor\nlittle hawthorns,” I was assuring them through my sobs, “it is not you\nthat want to make me unhappy, to force me to leave you. You, you have\nnever done me any harm. So I shall always love you.” And, drying my eyes,\nI promised them that, when I grew up, I would never copy the foolish\nexample of other men, but that even in Paris, on fine spring days, instead\nof paying calls and listening to silly talk, I would make excursions into\nthe country to see the first hawthorn-trees in bloom.",
        "Once in the fields we never left them again during the rest of our\nMéséglise walk. They were perpetually crossed, as though by invisible\nstreams of traffic, by the wind, which was to me the tutelary genius of\nCombray.  Every year, on the day of our arrival, in order to feel that I\nreally was at Combray, I would climb the hill to find it running again\nthrough my clothing, and setting me running in its wake. One always had\nthe wind for companion when one went the ’Méséglise way,’ on that swelling\nplain which stretched, mile beyond mile, without any disturbance of its\ngentle contour.  I knew that Mlle. Swann used often to go and spend a few\ndays at Laon, and, for all that it was many miles away, the distance was\nobviated by the absence of any intervening obstacle; when, on hot\nafternoons, I would see a breath of wind emerge from the farthest horizon,\nbowing the heads of the corn in distant fields, pouring like a flood over\nall that vast expanse, and finally settling down, warm and rustling, among\nthe clover and sainfoin at my feet, that plain which was common to us both\nseemed then to draw us together, to unite us; I would imagine that the\nsame breath had passed by her also, that there was some message from her\nin what it was whispering to me, without my being able to understand it,\nand I would catch and kiss it as it passed. On my left was a village\ncalled Champieu (Campus Pagani, according to the Curé). On my right I\ncould see across the cornfields the two crocketed, rustic spires of\nSaint-André-des-Champs, themselves as tapering, scaly, plated,\nhoneycombed, yellowed, and roughened as two ears of wheat.",
        "At regular intervals, among the inimitable ornamentation of their leaves,\nwhich can be mistaken for those of no other fruit-tree, the apple-trees\nwere exposing their broad petals of white satin, or hanging in shy bunches\ntheir unopened, blushing buds. It was while going the ’Méséglise way’ that\nI first noticed the circular shadow which apple-trees cast upon the sunlit\nground, and also those impalpable threads of golden silk which the setting\nsun weaves slantingly downwards from beneath their leaves, and which I\nwould see my father slash through with his stick without ever making them\nswerve from their straight path.",
        "Sometimes in the afternoon sky a white moon would creep up like a little\ncloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have\nto ’come on’ for a while, and so goes ’in front’ in her ordinary clothes\nto watch the rest of the company for a moment, but keeps in the\nbackground, not wishing to attract attention to herself. I was glad to\nfind her image reproduced in books and paintings, though these works of\nart were very different–at least in my earlier years, before Bloch had\nattuned my eyes and mind to more subtle harmonies–from those in which the\nmoon seems fair to me to-day, but in which I should not have recognised\nher then. It might be, for instance, some novel by Saintine, some\nlandscape by Gleyre, in which she is cut out sharply against the sky, in\nthe form of a silver sickle, some work as unsophisticated and as\nincomplete as were, at that date, my own impressions, and which it enraged\nmy grandmother’s sisters to see me admire. They held that one ought to set\nbefore children, and that children shewed their own innate good taste in\nadmiring, only such books and pictures as they would continue to admire\nwhen their minds were developed and mature. No doubt they regarded\naesthetic values as material objects which an unclouded vision could not\nfail to discern, without needing to have their equivalent in experience of\nlife stored up and slowly ripening in one’s heart.",
        "It was along the ’Méséglise way,’ at Montjouvain, a house built on the\nedge of a large pond, and overlooked by a steep, shrub-grown hill, that M.\nVinteuil lived. And so we used often to meet his daughter driving her\ndogcart at full speed along the road. After a certain year we never saw\nher alone, but always accompanied by a friend, a girl older than herself,\nwith an evil reputation in the neighbourhood, who in the end installed\nherself permanently, one day, at Montjouvain. People said: “That poor M.\nVinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone is talking\nabout, and to let his daughter–a man who is horrified if you use a word\nin the wrong sense–bring a woman like that to live under his roof. He\nsays that she is a most superior woman, with a heart of gold, and that she\nwould have shewn extraordinary musical talent if she had only been\ntrained. He may be sure it is not music that she is teaching his\ndaughter.” But M. Vinteuil assured them that it was, and indeed it is\nremarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their normal\nqualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in physical\nintercourse. Bodily passion, which has been so unjustly decried, compels\nits victims to display every vestige that is in them of unselfishness and\ngenerosity, and so effectively that they shine resplendent in the eyes of\nall beholders. Dr. Percepied, whose loud voice and bushy eyebrows enabled\nhim to play to his heart’s content the part of ’double-dealer,’ a part to\nwhich he was not, otherwise, adapted, without in the least degree\ncompromising his unassailable and quite unmerited reputation of being a\nkind-hearted old curmudgeon, could make the Curé and everyone else laugh\nuntil they cried by saying in a harsh voice: “What d’ye say to this, now?\nIt seems that she plays music with her friend, Mile. Vinteuil.  That\nsurprises you, does it? Oh, I know nothing, nothing at all. It was Papa\nVinteuil who told me all about it yesterday. After all, she has every\nright to be fond of music, that girl. I should never dream of thwarting\nthe artistic vocation of a child; nor Vinteuil either, it seems. And then\nhe plays music too, with his daughter’s friend. Why, gracious heavens, it\nmust be a regular musical box, that house out there! What are you laughing\nat?  I say they’ve been playing too much music, those people. I met Papa\nVinteuil the other day, by the cemetery. It was all he could do to keep on\nhis feet.”",
        "Anyone who, like ourselves, had seen M. Vinteuil, about this time,\navoiding people whom he knew, and turning away as soon as he caught sight\nof them, changed in a few months into an old man, engulfed in a sea of\nsorrows, incapable of any effort not directly aimed at promoting his\ndaughter’s happiness, spending whole days beside his wife’s grave, could\nhardly have failed to realise that he was gradually dying of a broken\nheart, could hardly have supposed that he paid no attention to the rumours\nwhich were going about. He knew, perhaps he even believed, what his\nneighbours were saying.  There is probably no one, however rigid his\nvirtue, who is not liable to find himself, by the complexity of\ncircumstances, living at close quarters with the very vice which he\nhimself has been most outspoken in condemning, without at first\nrecognising it beneath the disguise which it assumes on entering his\npresence, so as to wound him and to make him suffer; the odd words, the\nunaccountable attitude, one evening, of a person whom he has a thousand\nreasons for loving. But for a man of M. Vinteuil’s sensibility it must\nhave been far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to have to\nresign himself to one of those situations which are wrongly supposed to\noccur in Bohemian circles only; for they are produced whenever there needs\nto establish itself in the security necessary to its development a vice\nwhich Nature herself has planted in the soul of a child, perhaps by no\nmore than blending the virtues of its father and mother, as she might\nblend the colours of their eyes. And yet however much M. Vinteuil may have\nknown of his daughter’s conduct it did not follow that his adoration of\nher grew any less. The facts of life do not penetrate to the sphere in\nwhich our beliefs are cherished; as it was not they that engendered those\nbeliefs, so they are powerless to destroy them; they can aim at them\ncontinual blows of contradiction and disproof without weakening them; and\nan avalanche of miseries and maladies coming, one after another, without\ninterruption into the bosom of a family, will not make it lose faith in\neither the clemency of its God or the capacity of its physician. But when\nM. Vinteuil regarded his daughter and himself from the point of view of\nthe world, and of their reputation, when he attempted to place himself by\nher side in the rank which they occupied in the general estimation of\ntheir neighbours, then he was bound to give judgment, to utter his own and\nher social condemnation in precisely the terms which the inhabitant of\nCombray most hostile to him and his daughter would have employed; he saw\nhimself and her in ’low,’ in the very ’lowest water,’ inextricably\nstranded; and his manners had of late been tinged with that humility, that\nrespect for persons who ranked above him and to whom he must now look up\n(however far beneath him they might hitherto have been), that tendency to\nsearch for some means of rising again to their level, which is an almost\nmechanical result of any human misfortune.",
        "One day, when we were walking with Swann in one of the streets of Combray,\nM. Vinteuil, turning out of another street, found himself so suddenly face\nto face with us all that he had not time to escape; and Swann, with that\nalmost arrogant charity of a man of the world who, amid the dissolution of\nall his own moral prejudices, finds in another’s shame merely a reason for\ntreating him with a friendly benevolence, the outward signs of which serve\nto enhance and gratify the self-esteem of the bestower because he feels\nthat they are all the more precious to him upon whom they are bestowed,\nconversed at great length with M. Vinteuil, with whom for a long time he\nhad been barely on speaking terms, and invited him, before leaving us, to\nsend his daughter over, one day, to play at Tansonville. It was an\ninvitation which, two years earlier, would have enraged M. Vinteuil, but\nwhich now filled him with so much gratitude that he felt himself obliged\nto refrain from the indiscretion of accepting. Swann’s friendly regard for\nhis daughter seemed to him to be in itself so honourable, so precious a\nsupport for his cause that he felt it would perhaps be better to make no\nuse of it, so as to have the wholly Platonic satisfaction of keeping it in\nreserve.",
        "“What a charming man!” he said to us, after Swann had gone, with the same\nenthusiasm and veneration which make clever and pretty women of the middle\nclasses fall victims to the physical and intellectual charms of a duchess,\neven though she be ugly and a fool. “What a charming man!  What a pity\nthat he should have made such a deplorable marriage!”",
        "And then, so strong an element of hypocrisy is there in even the most\nsincere of men, who cast off, while they are talking to anyone, the\nopinion they actually hold of him and will express when he is no longer\nthere, my family joined with M. Vinteuil in deploring Swann’s marriage,\ninvoking principles and conventions which (all the more because they\ninvoked them in common with him, as though we were all thorough good\nfellows of the same sort) they appeared to suggest were in no way\ninfringed at Montjouvain.  M. Vinteuil did not send his daughter to visit\nSwann, an omission which Swann was the first to regret. For constantly,\nafter meeting M. Vinteuil, he would remember that he had been meaning for\na long time to ask him about some one of the same name as himself, one of\nhis relatives, Swann supposed. And on this occasion he determined that he\nwould not forget what he had to say to him when M. Vinteuil should appear\nwith his daughter at Tansonville.",
        "Since the ’Méséglise way’ was the shorter of the two that we used to take\nfor our walks round Combray, and for that reason was reserved for days of\nuncertain weather, it followed that the climate of Méséglise shewed an\nunduly high rainfall, and we would never lose sight of the fringe of\nRoussainville wood, so that we could, at any moment, run for shelter\nbeneath its dense thatch of leaves.",
        "Often the sun would disappear behind a cloud, which impinged on its\nroundness, but whose edge the sun gilded in return. The brightness, though\nnot the light of day, would then be shut off from a landscape in which all\nlife appeared to be suspended, while the little village of Roussainville\ncarved in relief upon the sky the white mass of its gables, with a\nstartling precision of detail. A gust of wind blew from its perch a rook,\nwhich floated away and settled in the distance, while beneath a paling sky\nthe woods on the horizon assumed a deeper tone of blue, as though they\nwere painted in one of those cameos which you still find decorating the\nwalls of old houses.",
        "But on other days would begin to fall the rain, of which we had had due\nwarning from the little barometer-figure which the spectacle-maker hung\nout in his doorway. Its drops, like migrating birds which fly off in a\nbody at a given moment, would come down out of the sky in close marching\norder.  They would never drift apart, would make no movement at random in\ntheir rapid course, but each one, keeping in its place, would draw after\nit the drop which was following, and the sky would be as greatly darkened\nas by the swallows flying south. We would take refuge among the trees. And\nwhen it seemed that their flight was accomplished, a few last drops,\nfeebler and slower than the rest, would still come down. But we would\nemerge from our shelter, for the rain was playing a game, now, among the\nbranches, and, even when it was almost dry again underfoot, a stray drop\nor two, lingering in the hollow of a leaf, would run down and hang\nglistening from the point of it until suddenly it splashed plump upon our\nupturned faces from the whole height of the tree.",
        "Often, too, we would hurry for shelter, tumbling in among all its stony\nsaints and patriarchs, into the porch of Saint-André-des-Champs, How\ntypically French that church was! Over its door the saints, the kings of\nchivalry with lilies in their hands, the wedding scenes and funerals were\ncarved as they might have been in the mind of Françoise. The sculptor had\nalso recorded certain anecdotes of Aristotle and Virgil, precisely as\nFrançoise in her kitchen would break into speech about Saint Louis as\nthough she herself had known him, generally in order to depreciate, by\ncontrast with him, my grandparents, whom she considered less ’righteous.’\nOne could see that the ideas which the mediaeval artist and the mediaeval\npeasant (who had survived to cook for us in the nineteenth century) had of\nclassical and of early Christian history, ideas whose inaccuracy was\natoned for by their honest simplicity, were derived not from books, but\nfrom a tradition at once ancient and direct, unbroken, oral, degraded,\nunrecognisable, and alive. Another Combray person whom I could discern\nalso, potential and typified, in the gothic sculptures of\nSaint-André-des-Champs was young Théodore, the assistant in Camus’s shop.\nAnd, indeed, Françoise herself was well aware that she had in him a\ncountryman and contemporary, for when my aunt was too ill for Françoise to\nbe able, unaided, to lift her in her bed or to carry her to her chair,\nrather than let the kitchen-maid come upstairs and, perhaps, ’make an\nimpression’ on my aunt, she would send out for Théodore. And this lad, who\nwas regarded, and quite rightly, in the town as a ’bad character,’ was so\nabounding in that spirit which had served to decorate the porch of\nSaint-André-des-Champs, and particularly in the feelings of respect due,\nin Franchise’s eyes, to all ’poor invalids,’ and, above all, to her own\n’poor mistress,’ that he had, when he bent down to raise my aunt’s head\nfrom her pillow, the same air of préraphaélite simplicity and zeal which\nthe little angels in the has-reliefs wear, who throng, with tapers in\ntheir hands, about the deathbed of Our Lady, as though those carved faces\nof stone, naked and grey like trees in winter, were, like them, asleep\nonly, storing up life and waiting to flower again in countless plebeian\nfaces, reverend and cunning as the face of Théodore, and glowing with the\nruddy brilliance of ripe apples.",
        "There, too, not fastened to the wall like the little angels, but detached\nfrom the porch, of more than human stature, erect upon her pedestal as\nupon a footstool, which had been placed there to save her feet from\ncontact with the wet ground, stood a saint with the full cheeks, the firm\nbreasts which swelled out inside her draperies like a cluster of ripe\ngrapes inside a bag, the narrow forehead, short and stubborn nose,\ndeep-set eyes, and strong, thick-skinned, courageous expression of the\ncountry-women of those parts. This similarity, which imparted to the\nstatue itself a kindliness that I had not looked to find in it, was\ncorroborated often by the arrival of some girl from the fields, come, like\nourselves, for shelter beneath the porch, whose presence there–as when\nthe leaves of a climbing plant have grown up beside leaves carved in\nstone–seemed intended by fate to allow us, by confronting it with its\ntype in nature, to form a critical estimate of the truth of the work of\nart. Before our eyes, in the distance, a promised or an accursed land,\nRoussainville, within whose walls I had never penetrated, Roussainville\nwas now, when the rain had ceased for us, still being chastised, like a\nvillage in the Old Testament, by all the innumerable spears and arrows of\nthe storm, which beat down obliquely upon the dwellings of its\ninhabitants, or else had already received the forgiveness of the Almighty,\nWho had restored to it the light of His sun, which fell upon it in rays of\nuneven length, like the rays of a monstrance upon an altar.",
        "Sometimes, when the weather had completely broken, we were obliged to go\nhome and to remain shut up indoors. Here and there, in the distance, in a\nlandscape which, what with the failing light and saturated atmosphere,\nresembled a seascape rather, a few solitary houses clinging to the lower\nslopes of a hill whose heights were buried in a cloudy darkness shone out\nlike little boats which had folded their sails and would ride at anchor,\nall night, upon the sea. But what mattered rain or storm? In summer, bad\nweather is no more than a passing fit of superficial ill-temper expressed\nby the permanent, underlying fine weather; a very different thing from the\nfluid and unstable ’fine weather’ of winter, its very opposite, in fact;\nfor has it not (firmly established in the soil, on which it has taken\nsolid form in dense masses of foliage over which the rain may pour in\ntorrents without weakening the resistance offered by their real and\nlasting happiness) hoisted, to keep them flying throughout the season, in\nthe village streets, on the walls of the houses and in their gardens, its\nsilken banners, violet and white. Sitting in the little parlour, where I\nwould pass the time until dinner with a book, I might hear the water\ndripping from our chestnut-trees, but I would know that the shower would\nonly glaze and brighten the greenness of their thick, crumpled leaves, and\nthat they themselves had undertaken to remain there, like pledges of\nsummer, all through the rainy night, to assure me of the fine weather’s\ncontinuing; it might rain as it pleased, but to-morrow, over the white\nfence of Tansonville, there would surge and flow, numerous as ever, a sea\nof little heart-shaped leaves; and without the least anxiety I could watch\nthe poplar in the Rue des Perchamps praying for mercy, bowing in\ndesperation before the storm; without the least anxiety I could hear, at\nthe far end of the garden, the last peals of thunder growling among our\nlilac-trees.",
        "If the weather was bad all morning, my family would abandon the idea of a\nwalk, and I would remain at home. But, later on, I formed the habit of\ngoing out by myself on such days, and walking towards\nMéséglise-la-Vineuse, during that autumn when we had to come to Combray to\nsettle the division of my aunt Léonie’s estate; for she had died at last,\nleaving both parties among her neighbours triumphant in the fact of her\ndemise–those who had insisted that her mode of life was enfeebling and\nmust ultimately kill her, and, equally, those who had always maintained\nthat she suffered from some disease not imaginary, but organic, by the\nvisible proof of which the most sceptical would be obliged to own\nthemselves convinced, once she had succumbed to it; causing no intense\ngrief to any save one of her survivors, but to that one a grief savage in\nits violence. During the long fortnight of my aunt’s last illness\nFrançoise never went out of her room for an instant, never took off her\nclothes, allowed no one else to do anything for my aunt, and did not leave\nher body until it was actually in its grave. Then, at last, we understood\nthat the sort of terror in which Françoise had lived of my aunt’s harsh\nwords, her suspicions and her anger, had developed in her a sentiment\nwhich we had mistaken for hatred, and which was really veneration and\nlove. Her true mistress, whose decisions it had been impossible to\nforesee, from whose stratagems it had been so hard to escape, of whose\ngood nature it had been so easy to take advantage, her sovereign, her\nmysterious and omnipotent monarch was no more. Compared with such a\nmistress we counted for very little. The time had long passed when, on our\nfirst coming to spend our holidays at Combray, we had been of equal\nimportance, in Franchise’s eyes, with my aunt.",
        "During that autumn my parents, finding the days so fully occupied with the\nlegal formalities that had to be gone through, and discussions with\nsolicitors and farmers, that they had little time for walks which, as it\nhappened, the weather made precarious, began to let me go, without them,\nalong the ’Méséglise way,’ wrapped up in a huge Highland plaid which\nprotected me from the rain, and which I was all the more ready to throw\nover my shoulders because I felt that the stripes of its gaudy tartan\nscandalised Françoise, whom it was impossible to convince that the colour\nof one’s clothes had nothing whatever to do with one’s mourning for the\ndead, and to whom the grief which we had shewn on my aunt’s death was\nwholly unsatisfactory, since we had not entertained the neighbours to a\ngreat funeral banquet, and did not adopt a special tone when we spoke of\nher, while I at times might be heard humming a tune. I am sure that in a\nbook–and to that extent my feelings were closely akin to those of\nFrançoise–such a conception of mourning, in the manner of the Chanson de\nRoland and of the porch of Saint-André-des-Champs, would have seemed most\nattractive.  But the moment that Françoise herself approached, some evil\nspirit would urge me to attempt to make her angry, and I would avail\nmyself of the slightest pretext to say to her that I regretted my aunt’s\ndeath because she had been a good woman in spite of her absurdities, but\nnot in the least because she was my aunt; that she might easily have been\nmy aunt and yet have been so odious that her death would not have caused\nme a moment’s sorrow; statements which, in a book, would have struck me as\nmerely fatuous.",
        "And if Françoise then, inspired like a poet with a flood of confused\nreflections upon bereavement, grief, and family memories, were to plead\nher inability to rebut my theories, saying: “I don’t know how to espress\nmyself\"–I would triumph over her with an ironical and brutal common sense\nworthy of Dr. Percepied; and if she went on: “All the same she was a\ngeological relation; there is always the respect due to your geology,\"\nI would shrug my shoulders and say: “It is really very good of me to\ndiscuss the matter with an illiterate old woman who cannot speak her own\nlanguage,” adopting, to deliver judgment on Françoise, the mean and narrow\noutlook of the pedant, whom those who are most contemptuous of him in the\nimpartiality of their own minds are only too prone to copy when they are\nobliged to play a part upon the vulgar stage of life.",
        "My walks, that autumn, were all the more delightful because I used to take\nthem after long hours spent over a book. When I was tired of reading,\nafter a whole morning in the house, I would throw my plaid across my\nshoulders and set out; my body, which in a long spell of enforced\nimmobility had stored up an accumulation of vital energy, was now obliged,\nlike a spinning-top wound and let go, to spend this in every direction.\nThe walls of houses, the Tansonville hedge, the trees of Roussainville\nwood, the bushes against which Montjouvain leaned its back, all must bear\nthe blows of my walking-stick or umbrella, must hear my shouts of\nhappiness, blows and shouts being indeed no more than expressions of the\nconfused ideas which exhilarated me, and which, not being developed to the\npoint at which they might rest exposed to the light of day, rather than\nsubmit to a slow and difficult course of elucidation, found it easier and\nmore pleasant to drift into an immediate outlet. And so it is that the\nbulk of what appear to be the emotional renderings of our inmost\nsensations do no more than relieve us of the burden of those sensations by\nallowing them to escape from us in an indistinct form which does not teach\nus how it should be interpreted. When I attempt to reckon up all that I\nowe to the ’Méséglise way,’ all the humble discoveries of which it was\neither the accidental setting or the direct inspiration and cause, I am\nreminded that it was in that same autumn, on one of those walks, near the\nbushy precipice which guarded Montjouvain from the rear, that I was struck\nfor the first time by this lack of harmony between our impressions and\ntheir normal forms of expression. After an hour of rain and wind, against\nwhich I had put up a brisk fight, as I came to the edge of the Montjouvain\npond, and reached a little hut, roofed with tiles, in which M. Vinteuil’s\ngardener kept his tools, the sun shone out again, and its golden rays,\nwashed clean by the shower, blazed once more in the sky, on the trees, on\nthe wall of the hut, and on the still wet tiles of the roof, which had a\nchicken perching upon its ridge. The wind pulled out sideways the wild\ngrass that grew in the wall, and the chicken’s downy feathers, both of\nwhich things let themselves float upon the wind’s breath to their full\nextent, with the unresisting submissiveness of light and lifeless matter.\nThe tiled roof cast upon the pond, whose reflections were now clear again\nin the sunlight, a square of pink marble, the like of which I had never\nobserved before. And, seeing upon the water, where it reflected the wall,\na pallid smile responding to the smiling sky, I cried aloud in my\nenthusiasm, brandishing my furled umbrella: “Damn, damn, damn, damn!” But\nat the same time I felt that I was in duty bound not to content myself\nwith these unilluminating words, but to endeavour to see more clearly into\nthe sources of my enjoyment.",
        "And it was at that moment, too–thanks to a peasant who went past,\napparently in a bad enough humour already, but more so when he nearly\nreceived my umbrella in his face, and who replied without any cordiality\nto my “Fine day, what! good to be out walking!\"–that I learned that\nidentical emotions do not spring up in the hearts of all men\nsimultaneously, by a pre-established order. Later on I discovered that,\nwhenever I had read for too long and was in a mood for conversation, the\nfriend to whom I would be burning to say something would at that moment\nhave finished indulging himself in the delights of conversation, and\nwanted nothing now but to be left to read undisturbed. And if I had been\nthinking with affection of my parents, and forming the most sensible and\nproper plans for giving them pleasure, they would have been using the same\ninterval of time to discover some misdeed that I had already forgotten,\nand would begin to scold me severely, just as I flung myself upon them\nwith a kiss.",
        "Sometimes to the exhilaration which I derived from being alone would be\nadded an alternative feeling, so that I could not be clear in my mind to\nwhich I should give the casting vote; a feeling stimulated by the desire\nto see rise up before my eyes a peasant-girl whom I might clasp in my\narms.  Coming abruptly, and without giving me time to trace it accurately\nto its source among so many ideas of a very different kind, the pleasure\nwhich accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was\ngiven me by my other thoughts. I found an additional merit in everything\nthat was in my mind at the moment, in the pink reflection of the tiled\nroof, the wild grass in the wall, the village of Roussainville into which\nI had long desired to penetrate, the trees of its wood and the steeple of\nits church, created in them by this fresh emotion which made them appear\nmore desirable only because I thought it was they that had provoked it,\nand which seemed only to wish to bear me more swiftly towards them when it\nfilled my sails with a potent, unknown, and propitious breeze. But if this\ndesire that a woman should appear added for me something more exalting\nthan the charms of nature, they in their turn enlarged what I might, in\nthe woman’s charm, have found too much restricted. It seemed to me that\nthe beauty of the trees was hers also, and that, as for the spirit of\nthose horizons, of the village of Roussainville, of the books which I was\nreading that year, it was her kiss which would make me master of them all;\nand, my imagination drawing strength from contact with my sensuality, my\nsensuality expanding through all the realms of my imagination, my desire\nhad no longer any bounds. Moreover–just as in moments of musing\ncontemplation of nature, the normal actions of the mind being suspended,\nand our abstract ideas of things set on one side, we believe with the\nprofoundest faith in the originality, in the individual existence of the\nplace in which we may happen to be–the passing figure which my desire\nevoked seemed to be not any one example of the general type of ’woman,’\nbut a necessary and natural product of the soil. For at that time\neverything which was not myself, the earth and the creatures upon it,\nseemed to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real\nexistence than they appear to full-grown men. And between the earth and\nits creatures I made no distinction. I had a desire for a peasant-girl\nfrom Méséglise or Roussainville, for a fisher-girl from Balbec, just as I\nhad a desire for Balbec and Méséglise. The pleasure which those girls were\nempowered to give me would have seemed less genuine, I should have had no\nfaith in it any longer, if I had been at liberty to modify its conditions\nas I chose. To meet in Paris a fisher-girl from Balbec or a peasant-girl\nfrom Méséglise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which\nI had never seen upon the beach, or of a fern which I had never found\namong the woods, would have stripped from the pleasure which she was about\nto give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my imagination\nhad enwrapped her. But to wander thus among the woods of Roussainville\nwithout a peasant-girl to embrace was to see those woods and yet know\nnothing of their secret treasure, their deep-hidden beauty.  That girl\nwhom I never saw save dappled with the shadows of their leaves, was to me\nherself a plant of local growth, only taller than the rest, and one whose\nstructure would enable me to approach more closely than in them to the\nintimate savour of the land from which she had sprung. I could believe\nthis all the more readily (and also that the caresses by which she would\nbring that savour to my senses were themselves of a particular kind,\nyielding a pleasure which I could never derive from any but herself) since\nI was still, and must for long remain, in that period of life when one has\nnot yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women\nin whose company one has tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a\ngeneral idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the variable\ninstruments of a pleasure that is always the same. Indeed, that pleasure\ndoes not exist, isolated and formulated in the consciousness, as the\nultimate object with which one seeks a woman’s company, or as the cause of\nthe uneasiness which, in anticipation, one then feels. Hardly even does\none think of oneself, but only how to escape from oneself. Obscurely\nawaited, immanent and concealed, it rouses to such a paroxysm, at the\nmoment when at last it makes itself felt, those other pleasures which we\nfind in the tender glance, in the kiss of her who is by our side, that it\nseems to us, more than anything else, a sort of transport of gratitude for\nthe kindness of heart of our companion and for her touching predilection\nof ourselves, which we measure by the benefits, by the happiness that she\nshowers upon us.",
        "Alas, it was in vain that I implored the dungeon-keep of Roussainville,\nthat I begged it to send out to meet me some daughter of its village,\nappealing to it as to the sole confidant to whom I had disclosed my\nearliest desire when, from the top floor of our house at Combray, from the\nlittle room that smelt of orris-root, I had peered out and seen nothing\nbut its tower, framed in the square of the half-opened window, while, with\nthe heroic scruples of a traveller setting forth for unknown climes, or of\na desperate wretch hesitating on the verge of self-destruction, faint with\nemotion, I explored, across the bounds of my own experience, an untrodden\npath which, I believed, might lead me to my death, even–until passion\nspent itself and left me shuddering among the sprays of flowering currant\nwhich, creeping in through the window, tumbled all about my body. In vain\nI called upon it now. In vain I compressed the whole landscape into my\nfield of vision, draining it with an exhaustive gaze which sought to\nextract from it a female creature. I might go alone as far as the porch of\nSaint-André-des-Champs: never did I find there the girl whom I should\ninevitably have met, had I been with my grandfather, and so unable to\nengage her in conversation.  I would fix my eyes, without limit of time,\nupon the trunk of a distant tree, from behind which she must appear and\nspring towards me; my closest scrutiny left the horizon barren as before;\nnight was falling; without any hope now would I concentrate my attention,\nas though to force up out of it the creatures which it must conceal, upon\nthat sterile soil, that stale and outworn land; and it was no longer in\nlightness of heart, but with sullen anger that I aimed blows at the trees\nof Roussainville wood, from among which no more living creatures made\ntheir appearance than if they had been trees painted on the stretched\ncanvas background of a panorama, when, unable to resign myself to having\nto return home without having held in my arms the woman I so greatly\ndesired, I was yet obliged to retrace my steps towards Combray, and to\nadmit to myself that the chance of her appearing in my path grew smaller\nevery moment. And if she had appeared, would I have dared to speak to her?\nI felt that she would have regarded me as mad, for I no longer thought of\nthose desires which came to me on my walks, but were never realized, as\nbeing shared by others, or as having any existence apart from myself. They\nseemed nothing more now than the purely subjective, impotent, illusory\ncreatures of my temperament. They were in no way connected now with\nnature, with the world of real things, which from now onwards lost all its\ncharm and significance, and meant no more to my life than a purely\nconventional framework, just as the action of a novel is framed in the\nrailway carriage, on a seat of which a traveller is reading it to pass the\ntime.",
        "And it is perhaps from another impression which I received at\nMont-jouvain, some years later, an impression which at that time was\nwithout meaning, that there arose, long afterwards, my idea of that cruel\nside of human passion called ’sadism.’ We shall see, in due course, that\nfor quite another reason the memory of this impression was to play an\nimportant part in my life. It was during a spell of very hot weather; my\nparents, who had been obliged to go away for the whole day, had told me\nthat I might stay out as late as I pleased; and having gone as far as the\nMontjouvain pond, where I enjoyed seeing again the reflection of the tiled\nroof of the hut, I had lain down in the shade and gone to sleep among the\nbushes on the steep slope that rose up behind the house, just where I had\nwaited for my parents, years before, one day when they had gone to call on\nM.  Vinteuil. It was almost dark when I awoke, and I wished to rise and go\naway, but I saw Mile. Vinteuil (or thought, at least, that I recognised\nher, for I had not seen her often at Combray, and then only when she was\nstill a child, whereas she was now growing into a young woman), who\nprobably had just come in, standing in front of me, and only a few feet\naway from me, in that room in which her father had entertained mine, and\nwhich she had now made into a little sitting-room for herself. The window\nwas partly open; the lamp was lighted; I could watch her every movement\nwithout her being able to see me; but, had I gone away, I must have made a\nrustling sound among the bushes, she would have heard me, and might have\nthought that I had been hiding there in order to spy upon her.",
        "She was in deep mourning, for her father had but lately died. We had not\ngone to see her; my mother had not cared to go, on account of that virtue\nwhich alone in her fixed any bounds to her benevolence–namely, modesty;\nbut she pitied the girl from the depths of her heart. My mother had not\nforgotten the sad end of M. Vinteuil’s life, his complete absorption,\nfirst in having to play both mother and nursery-maid to his daughter, and,\nlater, in the suffering which she had caused him; she could see the\ntortured expression which was never absent from the old man’s face in\nthose terrible last years; she knew that he had definitely abandoned the\ntask of transcribing in fair copies the whole of his later work, the poor\nlittle pieces, we imagined, of an old music-master, a retired village\norganist, which, we assumed, were of little or no value in themselves,\nthough we did not despise them, because they were of such great value to\nhim and had been the chief motive of his life before he sacrificed them to\nhis daughter; pieces which, being mostly not even written down, but\nrecorded only in his memory, while the rest were scribbled on loose sheets\nof paper, and quite illegible, must now remain unknown for ever; my mother\nthought, also, of that other and still more cruel renunciation to which M.\nVinteuil had been driven, that of seeing the girl happily settled, with an\nhonest and respectable future; when she called to mind all this utter and\ncrushing misery that had come upon my aunts’ old music-master, she was\nmoved to very real grief, and shuddered to think of that other grief, so\ndifferent in its bitterness, which Mlle. Vinteuil must now be feeling,\ntinged with remorse at having virtually killed her father. “Poor M.\nVinteuil,” my mother would say, “he lived for his daughter, and now he has\ndied for her, without getting his reward. Will he get it now, I wonder,\nand in what form?  It can only come to him from her.”",
        "At the far end of Mlle. Vinteuil’s sitting-room, on the mantelpiece, stood\na small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch, just as\nthe sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside, then flung\nherself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little table on which\nshe placed the photograph, just as, long ago, M. Vinteuil had ’placed’\nbeside him the piece of music which he would have liked to play over to my\nparents. And then her friend came in. Mlle. Vinteuil greeted her without\nrising, clasping her hands behind her head, and drew her body to one side\nof the sofa, as though to ’make room.’ But no sooner had she done this\nthan she appeared to feel that she was perhaps suggesting a particular\nposition to her friend, with an emphasis which might well be regarded as\nimportunate. She thought that her friend would prefer, no doubt, to sit\ndown at some distance from her, upon a chair; she felt that she had been\nindiscreet; her sensitive heart took fright; stretching herself out again\nover the whole of the sofa, she closed her eyes and began to yawn, so as\nto indicate that it was a desire to sleep, and that alone, which had made\nher lie down there. Despite the rude and hectoring familiarity with which\nshe treated her companion I could recognise in her the obsequious and\nreticent advances, the abrupt scruples and restraints which had\ncharacterised her father. Presently she rose and came to the window, where\nshe pretended to be trying to close the shutters and not succeeding.",
        "“Leave them open,” said her friend. “I am hot.”",
        "“But it’s too dreadful! People will see us,” Mlle. Vinteuil answered.  And\nthen she guessed, probably, that her friend would think that she had\nuttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other\nwords, which she seemed, indeed, to wish to hear spoken, but, from\nprudence, would let her friend be the first to speak. And so, although I\ncould not see her face clearly enough, I am sure that the expression must\nhave appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so delightful,\nwhen she hastily went on: “When I say ’see us’ I mean, of course, see us\nreading. It’s so dreadful to think that in every trivial little thing you\ndo some one may be overlooking you.”",
        "With the instinctive generosity of her nature, a courtesy beyond her\ncontrol, she refrained from uttering the studied words which, she had\nfelt, were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire. And\nperpetually, in the depths of her being, a shy and suppliant maiden would\nkneel before that other element, the old campaigner, battered but\ntriumphant, would intercede with him and oblige him to retire.",
        "“Oh, yes, it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at this\ntime of night in this densely populated district!” said her friend, with\nbitter irony. “And what if they are?” she went on, feeling bound to\nannotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which she was\nrepeating, out of good nature, like a lesson prepared beforehand which,\nshe knew, it would please Mlle. Vinteuil to hear. “And what if they are?\nAll the better that they should see us.”",
        "Mlle. Vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet. In her sensitive and\nscrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow, spontaneously,\nfrom her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her eager senses\nclamoured. She reached out as far as she could across the limitations of\nher true character to find the language appropriate to a vicious young\nwoman such as she longed to be thought, but the words which, she imagined,\nsuch a young woman might have uttered with sincerity sounded unreal in her\nown mouth. And what little she allowed herself to say was said in a\nstrained tone, in which her ingrained timidity paralysed her tendency to\nfreedom and audacity of speech; while she kept on interrupting herself\nwith: “You’re sure you aren’t cold? You aren’t too hot? You don’t want to\nsit and read by yourself?...",
        "“Your ladyship’s thoughts seem to be rather ’warm’ this evening,” she\nconcluded, doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used, on some\nearlier occasion, by her friend.",
        "In the V-shaped opening of her crape bodice Mlle. Vinteuil felt the sting\nof her friend’s sudden kiss; she gave a little scream and ran away; and\nthen they began to chase one another about the room, scrambling over the\nfurniture, their wide sleeves fluttering like wings, clucking and crowing\nlike a pair of amorous fowls. At last Mlle. Vinteuil fell down exhausted\nupon the sofa, where she was screened from me by the stooping body of her\nfriend. But the latter now had her back turned to the little table on\nwhich the old music-master’s portrait had been arranged. Mlle.  Vinteuil\nrealised that her friend would not see it unless her attention were drawn\nto it, and so exclaimed, as if she herself had just noticed it for the\nfirst time: “Oh! there’s my father’s picture looking at us; I can’t think\nwho can have put it there; I’m sure I’ve told them twenty times, that is\nnot the proper place for it.”",
        "I remembered the words that M. Vinteuil had used to my parents in\napologising for an obtrusive sheet of music. This photograph was, of\ncourse, in common use in their ritual observances, was subjected to daily\nprofanation, for the friend replied in words which were evidently a\nliturgical response: “Let him stay there. He can’t trouble us any longer.\nD’you think he’d start whining, d’you think he’d pack you out of the house\nif he could see you now, with the window open, the ugly old monkey?”",
        "To which Mlle. Vinteuil replied, “Oh, please!\"–a gentle reproach which\ntestified to the genuine goodness of her nature, not that it was prompted\nby any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this fashion (for\nthat was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself, by a long\ncourse of sophistries, to keep in close subjection at such moments), but\nrather because it was the bridle which, so as to avoid all appearance of\negotism, she herself used to curb the gratification which her friend was\nattempting to procure for her. It may well have been, too, that the\nsmiling moderation with which she faced and answered these blasphemies,\nthat this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her frank and\ngenerous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form of that\ncriminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to adopt.  But\nshe could not resist the attraction of being treated with affection by a\nwoman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards the defenceless\ndead; she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held out a chaste brow\nto be kissed; precisely as a daughter would have done to her mother,\nfeeling with exquisite joy that they would thus, between them, inflict the\nlast turn of the screw of cruelty, in robbing M. Vinteuil, as though they\nwere actually rifling his tomb, of the sacred rights of fatherhood. Her\nfriend took the girl’s head in her hands and placed a kiss on her brow\nwith a docility prompted by the real affection she had for Mlle. Vinteuil,\nas well as by the desire to bring what distraction she could into the dull\nand melancholy life of an orphan.",
        "“Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?” she said,\ntaking up the photograph. She murmured in Mlle. Vinteuil’s ear something\nthat I could not distinguish.",
        "“Oh! You would never dare.”",
        "“Not dare to spit on it? On that?” shouted the friend with deliberate\nbrutality.",
        "I heard no more, for Mlle. Vinteuil, who now seemed weary, awkward,\npreoccupied, sincere, and rather sad, came back to the window and drew the\nshutters close; but I knew now what was the reward that M. Vinteuil, in\nreturn for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime, on\naccount of his daughter, had received from her after his death.",
        "And yet I have since reflected that if M. Vinteuil had been able to be\npresent at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have\ncontinued to believe in his daughter’s soundness of heart, and that he\nmight even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. It was true that\nin all Mlle. Vinteuil’s actions the appearance of evil was so strong and\nso consistent that it would have been hard to find it exhibited in such\ncompleteness save in what is nowadays called a ’sadist’; it is behind the\nfootlights of a Paris theatre, and not under the homely lamp of an actual\ncountry house, that one expects to see a girl leading her friend on to\nspit upon the portrait of a father who has lived and died for nothing and\nno one but herself; and when we find in real life a desire for\nmelodramatic effect, it is generally the ’sadic’ instinct that is\nresponsible for it. It is possible that, without being in the least\ninclined towards ’sadism,’ a girl might have shewn the same outrageous\ncruelty as Mlle. Vinteuil in desecrating the memory and defying the wishes\nof her dead father, but she would not have given them deliberate\nexpression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking in subtlety;\nthe criminal element in her behaviour would have been less evident to\nother people, and even to herself, since she would not have admitted to\nherself that she was doing wrong. But, appearances apart, in Mlle.\nVinteuil’s soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element was\nprobably not unmixed. A ’sadist’ of her kind is an artist in evil, which a\nwholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil would not\nhave been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her, and would\nnot even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for virtue,\nrespect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never have\npractised the cult of these things, she would take no impious delight in\ntheir profanation.  ’Sadists’ of Mlle. Vinteuil’s sort are creatures so\npurely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even sensual pleasure\nappears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved for the wicked. And\nwhen they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it they endeavour to\nimpersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of wicked people, for\nthemselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain the momentary\nillusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and\nscrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I could\nunderstand how she must have longed for such an escape when I realised\nthat it was impossible for her to effect it. At the moment when she wished\nto be thought the very antithesis of her father, what she at once\nsuggested to me were the mannerisms, in thought and speech, of the poor\nold music-master. Indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she really\ndesecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures, but what\nremained between them and her and prevented her from any direct enjoyment\nof them, was the likeness between her face and his, his mother’s blue eyes\nwhich he had handed down to her, like some trinket to be kept in the\nfamily, those little friendly movements and inclinations which set up\nbetween the viciousness of Mlle. Vinteuil and herself a phraseology, a\nmentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it as not in any\nway different from the numberless little social duties and courtesies to\nwhich she must devote herself every day. It was not evil that gave her the\nidea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it was pleasure, rather,\nthat seemed evil. And as, every time that she indulged in it, pleasure\ncame to her attended by evil thoughts such as, ordinarily, had no place in\nher virtuous mind, she came at length to see in pleasure itself something\ndiabolical, to identify it with Evil. Perhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that at\nheart her friend was not altogether bad, not really sincere when she gave\nvent to those blasphemous utterances.  At any rate, she had the pleasure\nof receiving those kisses on her brow, those smiles, those glances; all\nfeigned, perhaps, but akin in their base and vicious mode of expression to\nthose which would have been discernible on the face of a creature formed\nnot out of kindness and long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and\ncruelty. She was able to delude herself for a moment into believing that\nshe was indeed amusing herself in the way in which, with so unnatural an\naccomplice, a girl might amuse herself who really did experience that\nsavage antipathy towards her father’s memory. Perhaps she would not have\nthought of wickedness as a state so rare, so abnormal, so exotic, one\nwhich it was so refreshing to visit, had she been able to distinguish in\nherself, as in all her fellow-men and women, that indifference to the\nsufferings which they cause which, whatever names else be given it, is the\none true, terrible and lasting form of cruelty.",
        "If the ’Méséglise way’ was so easy, it was a very different matter when we\ntook the ’Guermantes way,’ for that meant a long walk, and we must make\nsure, first, of the weather. When we seemed to have entered upon a spell\nof fine days, when Françoise, in desperation that not a drop was falling\nupon the ’poor crops,’ gazing up at the sky and seeing there only a little\nwhite cloud floating here and there upon its calm, azure surface, groaned\naloud and exclaimed: “You would say they were nothing more nor less than a\nlot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their snouts! Ah, they never\nthink of making it rain a little for the poor labourers! And then when the\ncorn is all ripe, down it will come, rattling all over the place, and\nthink no more of where it is falling than if it was on the sea!\"–when my\nfather’s appeals to the gardener had met with the same encouraging answer\nseveral times in succession, then some one would say, at dinner:\n\"To-morrow, if the weather holds, we might go the Guermantes way.” And off\nwe would set, immediately after luncheon, through the little garden gate\nwhich dropped us into the Rue des Perchamps, narrow and bent at a sharp\nangle, dotted with grass-plots over which two or three wasps would spend\nthe day botanising, a street as quaint as its name, from which its odd\ncharacteristics and its personality were, I felt, derived; a street for\nwhich one might search in vain through the Combray of to-day, for the\npublic school now rises upon its site. But in my dreams of Combray (like\nthose architects, pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, who, fancying that they can\ndetect, beneath a Renaissance rood-loft and an eighteenth-century altar,\ntraces of a Norman choir, restore the whole church to the state in which\nit probably was in the twelfth century) I leave not a stone of the modern\nedifice standing, I pierce through it and ’restore’ the Rue des Perchamps.\nAnd for such reconstruction memory furnishes me with more detailed\nguidance than is generally at the disposal of restorers; the pictures\nwhich it has preserved–perhaps the last surviving in the world to-day,\nand soon to follow the rest into oblivion–of what Combray looked like in\nmy childhood’s days; pictures which, simply because it was the old Combray\nthat traced their outlines upon my mind before it vanished, are as\nmoving–if I may compare a humble landscape with those glorious works,\nreproductions of which my grandmother was so fond of bestowing on me–as\nthose old engravings of the ’Cenacolo,’ or that painting by Gentile\nBellini, in which one sees, in a state in which they no longer exist, the\nmasterpiece of Leonardo and the portico of Saint Mark’s.",
        "We would pass, in the Rue de l’Oiseau, before the old hostelry of the\nOiseau Flesché, into whose great courtyard, once upon a time, would rumble\nthe coaches of the Duchesses de Montpensier, de Guermantes, and de\nMontmorency, when they had to come down to Combray for some litigation\nwith their farmers, or to receive homage from them. We would come at\nlength to the Mall, among whose treetops I could distinguish the steeple\nof Saint-Hilaire. And I should have liked to be able to sit down and spend\nthe whole day there, reading and listening to the bells, for it was so\ncharming there and so quiet that, when an hour struck, you would have said\nnot that it broke in upon the calm of the day, but that it relieved the\nday of its superfluity, and that the steeple, with the indolent,\npainstaking exactitude of a person who has nothing else to do, had simply,\nin order to squeeze out and let fall the few golden drops which had slowly\nand naturally accumulated in the hot sunlight, pressed, at a given moment,\nthe distended surface of the silence.",
        "The great charm of the ’Guermantes’ way was that we had beside us, almost\nall the time, the course of the Vivonne. We crossed it first, ten minutes\nafter leaving the house, by a foot-bridge called the Pont-Vieux.  And\nevery year, when we arrived at Combray, on Easter morning, after the\nsermon, if the weather was fine, I would run there to see (amid all the\ndisorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival, the gorgeous\npreparations for which make the everyday household utensils that they have\nnot contrived to banish seem more sordid than ever) the river flowing\npast, sky-blue already between banks still black and bare, its only\ncompanions a clump of daffodils, come out before their time, a few\nprimroses, the first in flower, while here and there burned the blue flame\nof a violet, its stem bent beneath the weight of the drop of perfume\nstored in its tiny horn. The Pont-Vieux led to a tow-path which, at this\npoint, would be overhung in summer by the bluish foliage of a hazel, under\nwhich a fisherman in a straw hat seemed to have taken root. At Combray,\nwhere I knew everyone, and could always detect the blacksmith or grocer’s\nboy through his disguise of a beadle’s uniform or chorister’s surplice,\nthis fisherman was the only person whom I was never able to identify. He\nmust have known my family, for he used to raise his hat when we passed;\nand then I would always be just on the point of asking his name, when some\none would make a sign to me to be quiet, or I would frighten the fish. We\nwould follow the tow-path which ran along the top of a steep bank, several\nfeet above the stream. The ground on the other side was lower, and\nstretched in a series of broad meadows as far as the village and even to\nthe distant railway-station. Over these were strewn the remains,\nhalf-buried in the long grass, of the castle of the old Counts of Combray,\nwho, during the Middle Ages, had had on this side the course of the\nVivonne as a barrier and defence against attack from the Lords of\nGuermantes and Abbots of Martinville. Nothing was left now but a few\nstumps of towers, hummocks upon the broad surface of the fields, hardly\nvisible, broken battlements over which, in their day, the bowmen had\nhurled down stones, the watchmen had gazed out over Novepont,\nClairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l’Exempt, fiefs all of them\nof Guermantes, a ring in which Combray was locked; but fallen among the\ngrass now, levelled with the ground, climbed and commanded by boys from\nthe Christian Brothers’ school, who came there in their playtime, or with\nlesson-books to be conned; emblems of a past that had sunk down and\nwell-nigh vanished under the earth, that lay by the water’s edge now, like\nan idler taking the air, yet giving me strong food for thought, making the\nname of Combray connote to me not the little town of to-day only, but an\nhistoric city vastly different, seizing and holding my imagination by the\nremote, incomprehensible features which it half-concealed beneath a\nspangled veil of buttercups. For the buttercups grew past numbering on\nthis spot which they had chosen for their games among the grass, standing\nsingly, in couples, in whole companies, yellow as the yolk of eggs, and\nglowing with an added lustre, I felt, because, being powerless to\nconsummate with my palate the pleasure which the sight of them never\nfailed to give me, I would let it accumulate as my eyes ranged over their\ngilded expanse, until it had acquired the strength to create in my mind a\nfresh example of absolute, unproductive beauty; and so it had been from my\nearliest childhood, when from the tow-path I had stretched out my arms\ntowards them, before even I could pronounce their charming name–a name\nfit for the Prince in some French fairy-tale; colonists, perhaps, in some\nfar distant century from Asia, but naturalised now for ever in the\nvillage, well satisfied with their modest horizon, rejoicing in the\nsunshine and the water’s edge, faithful to their little glimpse of the\nrailway-station; yet keeping, none the less, as do some of our old\npaintings, in their plebeian simplicity, a poetic scintillation from the\ngolden East.",
        "I would amuse myself by watching the glass jars which the boys used to\nlower into the Vivonne, to catch minnows, and which, filled by the current\nof the stream, in which they themselves also were enclosed, at once\n’containers’ whose transparent sides were like solidified water and\n’contents’ plunged into a still larger container of liquid, flowing\ncrystal, suggested an image of coolness more delicious and more provoking\nthan the same water in the same jars would have done, standing upon a\ntable laid for dinner, by shewing it as perpetually in flight between the\nimpalpable water, in which my hands could not arrest it, and the insoluble\nglass, in which my palate could not enjoy it. I decided that I would come\nthere again with a line and catch fish; I begged for and obtained a morsel\nof bread from our luncheon basket; and threw into the Vivonne pellets\nwhich had the power, it seemed, to bring about a chemical precipitation,\nfor the water at once grew solid round about them in oval clusters of\nemaciated tadpoles, which until then it had, no doubt, been holding in\nsolution, invisible, but ready and alert to enter the stage of\ncrystallisation.",
        "Presently the course of the Vivonne became choked with water-plants.  At\nfirst they appeared singly, a lily, for instance, which the current,\nacross whose path it had unfortunately grown, would never leave at rest\nfor a moment, so that, like a ferry-boat mechanically propelled, it would\ndrift over to one bank only to return to the other, eternally repeating\nits double journey. Thrust towards the bank, its stalk would be\nstraightened out, lengthened, strained almost to breaking-point until the\ncurrent again caught it, its green moorings swung back over their\nanchorage and brought the unhappy plant to what might fitly be called its\nstarting-point, since it was fated not to rest there a moment before\nmoving off once again. I would still find it there, on one walk after\nanother, always in the same helpless state, suggesting certain victims of\nneurasthenia, among whom my grandfather would have included my aunt\nLéonie, who present without modification, year after year, the spectacle\nof their odd and unaccountable habits, which they always imagine\nthemselves to be on the point of shaking off, but which they always retain\nto the end; caught in the treadmill of their own maladies and\neccentricities, their futile endeavours to escape serve only to actuate\nits mechanism, to keep in motion the clockwork of their strange,\nineluctable, fatal daily round. Such as these was the water-lily, and also\nlike one of those wretches whose peculiar torments, repeated indefinitely\nthroughout eternity, aroused the curiosity of Dante, who would have\ninquired of them at greater length and in fuller detail from the victims\nthemselves, had not Virgil, striding on ahead, obliged him to hasten after\nhim at full speed, as I must hasten after my parents.",
        "But farther on the current slackened, where the stream ran through a\nproperty thrown open to the public by its owner, who had made a hobby of\naquatic gardening, so that the little ponds into which the Vivonne was\nhere diverted were aflower with water-lilies. As the banks at this point\nwere thickly wooded, the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a\nbackground which was ordinarily dark green, although sometimes, when we\nwere coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon, I have seen\nin its depths a clear, crude blue that was almost violet, suggesting a\nfloor of Japanese cloisonné. Here and there, on the surface, floated,\nblushing like a strawberry, the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of\nwhite petals.",
        "Beyond these the flowers were more frequent, but paler, less glossy, more\nthickly seeded, more tightly folded, and disposed, by accident, in\nfestoons so graceful that I would fancy I saw floating upon the stream, as\nthough after the dreary stripping of the decorations used in some Watteau\nfestival, moss-roses in loosened garlands. Elsewhere a corner seemed to be\nreserved for the commoner kinds of lily; of a neat pink or white like\nrocket-flowers, washed clean like porcelain, with housewifely care; while,\na little farther again, were others, pressed close together in a floating\ngarden-bed, as though pansies had flown out of a garden like butterflies\nand were hovering with blue and burnished wings over the transparent\nshadowiness of this watery border; this skiey border also, for it set\nbeneath the flowers a soil of a colour more precious, more moving than\ntheir own; and both in the afternoon, when it sparkled beneath the lilies\nin the kaleidoscope of a happiness silent, restless, and alert, and\ntowards evening, when it was filled like a distant heaven with the roseate\ndreams of the setting sun, incessantly changing and ever remaining in\nharmony, about the more permanent colour of the flowers themselves, with\nthe utmost profundity, evanescence, and mystery–with a quiet suggestion\nof infinity; afternoon or evening, it seemed to have set them flowering in\nthe heart of the sky.",
        "After leaving this park the Vivonne began to flow again more swiftly.  How\noften have I watched, and longed to imitate, when I should be free to live\nas I chose, a rower who had shipped his oars and lay stretched out on his\nback, his head down, in the bottom of his boat, letting it drift with the\ncurrent, seeing nothing but the sky which slipped quietly above him,\nshewing upon his features a foretaste of happiness and peace.",
        "We would sit down among the irises at the water’s edge. In the holiday sky\na lazy cloud streamed out to its full length. Now and then, crushed by the\nburden of idleness, a carp would heave up out of the water, with an\nanxious gasp. It was time for us to feed. Before starting homewards we\nwould sit for a long time there, eating fruit and bread and chocolate, on\nthe grass, over which came to our ears, horizontal, faint, but solid still\nand metallic, the sound of the bells of Saint-Hilaire, which had melted\nnot at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed to traverse, but,\nbroken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all their sonorous\nstrokes, throbbed as it brushed the flowers at our feet.",
        "Sometimes, at the water’s edge and embedded in trees, we would come upon a\nhouse of the kind called ’pleasure houses,’ isolated and lost, seeing\nnothing of the world, save the river which bathed its feet. A young woman,\nwhose pensive face and fashionable veils did not suggest a local origin,\nand who had doubtless come there, in the popular phrase, ’to bury herself,’\nto taste the bitter sweetness of feeling that her name, and still more the\nname of him whose heart she had once held, but had been unable to keep,\nwere unknown there, stood framed in a window from which she had no outlook\nbeyond the boat that was moored beside her door. She raised her eyes with\nan air of distraction when she heard, through the trees that lined the\nbank, the voices of passers-by of whom, before they came in sight, she\nmight be certain that never had they known, nor would they know, the\nfaithless lover, that nothing in their past lives bore his imprint, which\nnothing in their future would have occasion to receive. One felt that in\nher renunciation of life she had willingly abandoned those places in which\nshe would at least have been able to see him whom she loved, for others\nwhere he had never trod. And I watched her, as she returned from some walk\nalong a road where she had known that he would not appear, drawing from\nher submissive fingers long gloves of a precious, useless charm.",
        "Never, in the course of our walks along the ’Guermantes way,’ might we\npenetrate as far as the source of the Vivonne, of which I had often\nthought, which had in my mind so abstract, so ideal an existence, that I\nhad been as much surprised when some one told me that it was actually to\nbe found in the same department, and at a given number of miles from\nCombray, as I had been on the day when I had learned that there was\nanother fixed point somewhere on the earth’s surface, where, according to\nthe ancients, opened the jaws of Hell. Nor could we ever reach that other\ngoal, to which I longed so much to attain, Guermantes itself. I knew that\nit was the residence of its proprietors, the Duc and Duchesse de\nGuermantes, I knew that they were real personages who did actually exist,\nbut whenever I thought about them I pictured them to myself either in\ntapestry, as was the ’Coronation of Esther’ which hung in our church, or\nelse in changing, rainbow colours, as was Gilbert the Bad in his window,\nwhere he passed from cabbage green, when I was dipping my fingers in the\nholy water stoup, to plum blue when I had reached our row of chairs, or\nagain altogether impalpable, like the image of Geneviève de Brabant,\nancestress of the Guermantes family, which the magic lantern sent\nwandering over the curtains of my room or flung aloft upon the ceiling–in\nshort, always wrapped in the mystery of the Merovingian age, and bathed,\nas in a sunset, in the orange light which glowed from the resounding\nsyllable ’antes.’ And if, in spite of that, they were for me, in their\ncapacity as a duke and a duchess, real people, though of an unfamiliar\nkind, this ducal personality was in its turn enormously distended,\nimmaterialised, so as to encircle and contain that Guermantes of which\nthey were duke and duchess, all that sunlit ’Guermantes way’ of our walks,\nthe course of the Vivonne, its water-lilies and its overshadowing trees,\nand an endless series of hot summer afternoons. And I knew that they bore\nnot only the titles of Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, but that since the\nfourteenth century, when, after vain attempts to conquer its earlier lords\nin battle, they had allied themselves by marriage, and so became Counts of\nCombray, the first citizens, consequently, of the place, and yet the only\nones among its citizens who did not reside in it–Comtes de Combray,\npossessing Combray, threading it on their string of names and titles,\nabsorbing it in their personalities, and illustrating, no doubt, in\nthemselves that strange and pious melancholy which was peculiar to\nCombray; proprietors of the town, though not of any particular house\nthere; dwelling, presumably, out of doors, in the street, between heaven\nand earth, like that Gilbert de Guermantes, of whom I could see, in the\nstained glass of the apse of Saint-Hilaire, only the ’other side’ in dull\nblack lacquer, if I raised my eyes to look for him, when I was going to\nCamus’s for a packet of salt.",
        "And then it happened that, going the ’Guermantes way,’ I passed\noccasionally by a row of well-watered little gardens, over whose hedges\nrose clusters of dark blossom. I would stop before them, hoping to gain\nsome precious addition to my experience, for I seemed to have before my\neyes a fragment of that riverside country which I had longed so much to\nsee and know since coming upon a description of it by one of my favourite\nauthors. And it was with that story-book land, with its imagined soil\nintersected by a hundred bubbling watercourses, that Guermantes, changing\nits form in my mind, became identified, after I heard Dr. Percepied speak\nof the flowers and the charming rivulets and fountains that were to be\nseen there in the ducal park. I used to dream that Mme. de Guermantes,\ntaking a sudden capricious fancy for myself, invited me there, that all\nday long she stood fishing for trout by my side. And when evening came,\nholding my hand in her own, as we passed by the little gardens of her\nvassals, she would point out to me the flowers that leaned their red and\npurple spikes along the tops of the low walls, and would teach me all\ntheir names. She would make me tell her, too, all about the poems that I\nmeant to compose. And these dreams reminded me that, since I wished, some\nday, to become a writer, it was high time to decide what sort of books I\nwas going to write. But as soon as I asked myself the question, and tried\nto discover some subjects to which I could impart a philosophical\nsignificance of infinite value, my mind would stop like a clock, I would\nsee before me vacuity, nothing, would feel either that I was wholly devoid\nof talent, or that, perhaps, a malady of the brain was hindering its\ndevelopment.  Sometimes I would depend upon my father’s arranging\neverything for me. He was so powerful, in such favour with the people who\n’really counted,’ that he made it possible for us to transgress laws which\nFrançoise had taught me to regard as more ineluctable than the laws of\nlife and death, as when we were allowed to postpone for a year the\ncompulsory repainting of the walls of our house, alone among all the\nhouses in that part of Paris, or when he obtained permission from the\nMinister for Mme.  Sazerat’s son, who had been ordered to some\nwatering-place, to take his degree two months before the proper time,\namong the candidates whose surnames began with ’A,’ instead of having to\nwait his turn as an ’S.’ If I had fallen seriously ill, if I had been\ncaptured by brigands, convinced that my father’s understanding with the\nsupreme powers was too complete, that his letters of introduction to the\nAlmighty were too irresistible for my illness or captivity to turn out\nanything but vain illusions, in which there was no danger actually\nthreatening me, I should have awaited with perfect composure the\ninevitable hour of my return to comfortable realities, of my deliverance\nfrom bondage or restoration to health. Perhaps this want of talent, this\nblack cavity which gaped in my mind when I ransacked it for the theme of\nmy future writings, was itself no more, either, than an unsubstantial\nillusion, and would be brought to an end by the intervention of my father,\nwho would arrange with the Government and with Providence that I should be\nthe first writer of my day.  But at other times, while my parents were\ngrowing impatient at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them, my\nactual life, instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father, and\none which he could modify as he chose, appeared, on the contrary, to be\ncomprised in a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit,\nfrom whose judgments there was no appeal, in the heart of which I was\nbound, helpless, without friend or ally, and beyond which no further\npossibilities lay concealed. It was evident to me then that I existed in\nthe same manner as all other men, that I must grow old, that I must die\nlike them, and that among them I was to be distinguished merely as one of\nthose who have no aptitude for writing. And so, utterly despondent, I\nrenounced literature for ever, despite the encouragements that had been\ngiven me by Bloch. This intimate, spontaneous feeling, this sense of the\nnullity of my intellect, prevailed against all the flattering speeches\nthat might be lavished upon me, as a wicked man, when everyone is loud in\nthe praise of his good deeds, is gnawed by the secret remorse of\nconscience.",
        "One day my mother said: “You are always talking about Mme. de Guermantes.\nWell, Dr. Percepied did a great deal for her when she was ill, four years\nago, and so she is coming to Combray for his daughter’s wedding. You will\nbe able to see her in church.” It was from Dr. Percepied, as it happened,\nthat I had heard most about Mme. de Guermantes, and he had even shewn us\nthe number of an illustrated paper in which she was depicted in the\ncostume which she had worn at a fancy dress ball given by the Princesse de\nLéon.",
        "Suddenly, during the nuptial mass, the beadle, by moving to one side,\nenabled me to see, sitting in a chapel, a lady with fair hair and a large\nnose, piercing blue eyes, a billowy scarf of mauve silk, glossy and new\nand brilliant, and a little spot at the corner of her nose. And because on\nthe surface of her face, which was red, as though she had been very warm,\nI could make out, diluted and barely perceptible, details which resembled\nthe portrait that had been shewn to me; because, more especially, the\nparticular features which I remarked in this lady, if I attempted to\ncatalogue them, formulated themselves in precisely the same terms:–a\nlarge nose, blue eyes, as Dr. Percepied had used when describing in my\npresence the Duchesse de Guermantes, I said to myself: “This lady is like\nthe Duchesse de Guermantes.” Now the chapel from which she was following\nthe service was that of Gilbert the Bad; beneath its flat tombstones,\nyellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb, rested the bones of\nthe old Counts of Brabant; and I remembered having heard it said that this\nchapel was reserved for the Guermantes family, whenever any of its members\ncame to attend a ceremony at Combray; there was, indeed, but one woman\nresembling the portrait of Mme. de Guermantes who on that day, the very\nday on which she was expected to come there, could be sitting in that\nchapel: it was she! My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not\nhaving borne in mind, when I thought of Mme. de Guermantes, that I was\npicturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a painted window,\nas living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest\nof the human race. Never had I taken into account that she might have a\nred face, a mauve scarf like Mme. Sazerat; and the oval curve of her\ncheeks reminded me so strongly of people whom I had seen at home that the\nsuspicion brushed against my mind (though it was immediately banished)\nthat this lady in her creative principle, in the molecules of her physical\ncomposition, was perhaps not substantially the Duchesse de Guermantes, but\nthat her body, in ignorance of the name that people had given it, belonged\nto a certain type of femininity which included, also, the wives of doctors\nand tradesmen. “It is, it must be Mme. de Guermantes, and no one else!\"\nwere the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with\nwhich I was gazing upon this image, which, naturally enough, bore no\nresemblance to those that had so often, under the same title of ’Mme. de\nGuermantes,’ appeared to me in dreams, since this one had not been, like\nthe others, formed arbitrarily by myself, but had sprung into sight for\nthe first time, only a moment ago, here in church; an image which was not\nof the same nature, was not colourable at will, like those others that\nallowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous syllable, but\nwhich was so real that everything, even to the fiery little spot at the\ncorner of her nose, gave an assurance of her subjection to the laws of\nlife, as in a transformation scene on the stage a crease in the dress of a\nfairy, a quivering of her tiny finger, indicate the material presence of a\nliving actress before our eyes, whereas we were uncertain, till then,\nwhether we were not looking merely at a projection of limelight from a\nlantern.",
        "Meanwhile I was endeavouring to apply to this image, which the prominent\nnose, the piercing eyes pinned down and fixed in my field of vision\n(perhaps because it was they that had first struck it, that had made the\nfirst impression on its surface, before I had had time to wonder whether\nthe woman who thus appeared before me might possibly be Mme.  de\nGuermantes), to this fresh and unchanging image the idea: “It is Mme.  de\nGuermantes\"; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and\nthe image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes, with a\nspace between. But this Mme. de Guermantes of whom I had so often dreamed,\nnow that I could see that she had a real existence independent of myself,\nacquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination, which, paralysed\nfor a moment by contact with a reality so different from anything that it\nhad expected, began to react and to say within me: “Great and glorious\nbefore the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes had the right of life and\ndeath over their vassals; the Duchesse de Guermantes descends from\nGeneviève de Brabant. She does not know, nor would she consent to know,\nany of the people who are here to-day.”",
        "And then–oh, marvellous independence of the human gaze, tied to the human\nface by a cord so loose, so long, so elastic that it can stray, alone, as\nfar as it may choose–while Mme. de Guermantes sat in the chapel above the\ntombs of her dead ancestors, her gaze lingered here and wandered there,\nrose to the capitals of the pillars, and even rested upon myself, like a\nray of sunlight straying down the nave, but a ray of sunlight which, at\nthe moment when I received its caress, appeared conscious of where it\nfell. As for Mme. de Guermantes herself, since she remained there\nmotionless, sitting like a mother who affects not to notice the rude or\nawkward conduct of her children who, in the course of their play, are\nspeaking to people whom she does not know, it was impossible for me to\ndetermine whether she approved or condemned the vagrancy of her eyes in\nthe careless detachment of her heart.",
        "I felt it to be important that she should not leave the church before I\nhad been able to look long enough upon her, reminding myself that for\nyears past I had regarded the sight of her as a thing eminently to be\ndesired, and I kept my eyes fixed on her, as though by gazing at her I\nshould be able to carry away and incorporate, to store up, for later\nreference, in myself the memory of that prominent nose, those red cheeks,\nof all those details which struck me as so much precious, authentic,\nunparalleled information with regard to her face. And now that, whenever I\nbrought my mind to bear upon that face–and especially, perhaps, in my\ndetermination, that form of the instinct of self-preservation with which\nwe guard everything that is best in ourselves, not to admit that I had\nbeen in any way deceived–I found only beauty there; setting her once\nagain (since they were one and the same person, this lady who sat before\nme and that Duchesse de Guermantes whom, until then, I had been used to\nconjure into an imagined shape) apart from and above that common run of\nhumanity with which the sight, pure and simple, of her in the flesh had\nmade me for a moment confound her, I grew indignant when I heard people\nsaying, in the congregation round me: “She is better looking than Mme.\nSazerat” or “than Mlle. Vinteuil,” as though she had been in any way\ncomparable with them. And my gaze resting upon her fair hair, her blue\neyes, the lines of her neck, and overlooking the features which might have\nreminded me of the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I\nadmired this deliberately unfinished sketch: “How lovely she is!  What\ntrue nobility! it is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of\nGeneviève de Brabant, that I have before me!” And the care which I took to\nfocus all my attention upon her face succeeded in isolating it so\ncompletely that to-day, when I call that marriage ceremony to mind, I find\nit impossible to visualise any single person who was present except her,\nand the beadle who answered me in the affirmative when I inquired whether\nthe lady was, indeed, Mme. de Guermantes. But her, I can see her still\nquite clearly, especially at the moment when the procession filed into the\nsacristy, lighted by the intermittent, hot sunshine of a windy and rainy\nday, where Mme. de Guermantes found herself in the midst of all those\nCombray people whose names, even, she did not know, but whose inferiority\nproclaimed her own supremacy so loud that she must, in return, feel for\nthem a genuine, pitying sympathy, and whom she might count on impressing\neven more forcibly by virtue of her simplicity and natural charm. And\nthen, too, since she could not bring into play the deliberate glances,\ncharged with a definite meaning, which one directs, in a crowd, towards\npeople whom one knows, but must allow her vague thoughts to escape\ncontinually from her eyes in a flood of blue light which she was powerless\nto control, she was anxious not to distress in any way, not to seem to be\ndespising those humbler mortals over whom that current flowed, by whom it\nwas everywhere arrested. I can see again to-day, above her mauve scarf,\nsilky and buoyant, the gentle astonishment in her eyes, to which she had\nadded, without daring to address it to anyone in particular, but so that\neveryone might enjoy his share of it, the almost timid smile of a\nsovereign lady who seems to be making an apology for her presence among\nthe vassals whom she loves. This smile rested upon myself, who had never\nceased to follow her with my eyes. And I, remembering the glance which she\nhad let fall upon me during the service, blue as a ray of sunlight that\nhad penetrated the window of Gilbert the Bad, said to myself, “Of course,\nshe is thinking about me.” I fancied that I had found favour in her sight,\nthat she would continue to think of me after she had left the church, and\nwould, perhaps, grow pensive again, that evening, at Guermantes, on my\naccount. And at once I fell in love with her, for if it is sometimes\nenough to make us love a woman that she looks on us with contempt, as I\nsupposed Mlle. Swann to have done, while we imagine that she cannot ever\nbe ours, it is enough, also, sometimes that she looks on us kindly, as\nMme. de Guermantes did then, while we think of her as almost ours already.\nHer eyes waxed blue as a periwinkle flower, wholly beyond my reach, yet\ndedicated by her to me; and the sun, bursting out again from behind a\nthreatening cloud and darting the full force of its rays on to the Square\nand into the sacristy, shed a geranium glow over the red carpet laid down\nfor the wedding, along which Mme. de Guermantes smilingly advanced, and\ncovered its woollen texture with a nap of rosy velvet, a bloom of light,\ngiving it that sort of tenderness, of solemn sweetness in the pomp of a\njoyful celebration, which characterises certain pages of Lohengrin,\ncertain paintings by Carpaccio, and makes us understand how Baudelaire was\nable to apply to the sound of the trumpet the epithet ’delicious.’",
        "How often, after that day, in the course of my walks along the\n’Guermantes way,’ and with what an intensified melancholy did I reflect\non my lack of qualification for a literary career, and that I must abandon\nall hope of ever becoming a famous author. The regret that I felt for\nthis, while I lingered alone to dream for a little by myself, made me\nsuffer so acutely that, in order not to feel it, my mind of its own\naccord, by a sort of inhibition in the instant of pain, ceased entirely to\nthink of verse-making, of fiction, of the poetic future on which my want\nof talent precluded me from counting. Then, quite apart from all those\nliterary preoccupations, and without definite attachment to anything,\nsuddenly a roof, a gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone, the smell of\na road would make me stop still, to enjoy the special pleasure that each\nof them gave me, and also because they appeared to be concealing, beneath\nwhat my eyes could see, something which they invited me to approach and\nseize from them, but which, despite all my efforts, I never managed to\ndiscover.  As I felt that the mysterious object was to be found in them, I\nwould stand there in front of them, motionless, gazing, breathing,\nendeavouring to penetrate with my mind beyond the thing seen or smelt. And\nif I had then to hasten after my grandfather, to proceed on my way, I\nwould still seek to recover my sense of them by closing my eyes; I would\nconcentrate upon recalling exactly the line of the roof, the colour of the\nstone, which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me to\nbe teeming, ready to open, to yield up to me the secret treasure of which\nthey were themselves no more than the outer coverings. It was certainly\nnot any impression of this kind that could or would restore the hope I had\nlost of succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet, for each of\nthem was associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual\nvalue, and suggesting no abstract truth. But at least they gave me an\nunreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind; and in\nthat way distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own impotence\nwhich I had felt whenever I had sought a philosophic theme for some great\nliterary work. So urgent was the task imposed on my conscience by these\nimpressions of form or perfume or colour–to strive for a perception of\nwhat lay hidden beneath them, that I was never long in seeking an excuse\nwhich would allow me to relax so strenuous an effort and to spare myself\nthe fatigue that it involved. As good luck would have it, my parents\ncalled me; I felt that I had not, for the moment, the calm environment\nnecessary for a successful pursuit of my researches, and that it would be\nbetter to think no more of the matter until I reached home, and not to\nexhaust myself in the meantime to no purpose. And so I concerned myself no\nlonger with the mystery that lay hidden in a form or a perfume, quite at\nease in my mind, since I was taking it home with me, protected by its\nvisible and tangible covering, beneath which I should find it still alive,\nlike the fish which, on days when I had been allowed to go out fishing, I\nused to carry back in my basket, buried in a couch of grass which kept\nthem cool and fresh. Once in the house again I would begin to think of\nsomething else, and so my mind would become littered (as my room was with\nthe flowers that I had gathered on my walks, or the odds and ends that\npeople had given me) with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight\nwas reflected, a roof, the sound of a bell, the smell of fallen leaves, a\nconfused mass of different images, under which must have perished long ago\nthe reality of which I used to have some foreboding, but which I never had\nthe energy to discover and bring to light. Once, however, when we had\nprolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits, and so had been very\nglad to encounter, half way home, as afternoon darkened into evening, Dr.\nPercepied, who drove past us at full speed in his carriage, saw and\nrecognised us, stopped, and made us jump in beside him, I received an\nimpression of this sort which I did not abandon without having first\nsubjected it to an examination a little more thorough. I had been set on\nthe box beside the coachman, we were going like the wind because the\nDoctor had still, before returning to Combray, to call at\nMartinville-le-Sec, at the house of a patient, at whose door he asked us\nto wait for him. At a bend in the road I experienced, suddenly, that\nspecial pleasure, which bore no resemblance to any other, when I caught\nsight of the twin steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun was\nplaying, while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road\nseemed to keep them continually changing their position; and then of a\nthird steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, which, although separated from them by a\nhill and a valley, and rising from rather higher ground in the distance,\nappeared none the less to be standing by their side.",
        "In ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires, the changes of\naspect, the sunny warmth of their surfaces, I felt that I was not\npenetrating to the full depth of my impression, that something more lay\nbehind that mobility, that luminosity, something which they seemed at once\nto contain and to conceal.",
        "The steeples appeared so distant, and we ourselves seemed to come so\nlittle nearer them, that I was astonished when, a few minutes later, we\ndrew up outside the church of Martinville. I did not know the reason for\nthe pleasure which I had found in seeing them upon the horizon, and the\nbusiness of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me irksome;\nI wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging lines,\nmoving in the sunshine, and, for the time being, to think of them no more.\nAnd it is probable that, had I done so, those two steeples would have\nvanished for ever, in a great medley of trees and roofs and scents and\nsounds which I had noticed and set apart on account of the obscure sense\nof pleasure which they gave me, but without ever exploring them more\nfully. I got down from the box to talk to my parents while we were waiting\nfor the Doctor to reappear. Then it was time to start; I climbed up again\nto my place, turning my head to look back, once more, at my steeples, of\nwhich, a little later, I caught a farewell glimpse at a turn in the road.\nThe coachman, who seemed little inclined for conversation, having barely\nacknowledged my remarks, I was obliged, in default of other society, to\nfall back on my own, and to attempt to recapture the vision of my\nsteeples. And presently their outlines and their sunlit surface, as though\nthey had been a sort of rind, were stripped apart; a little of what they\nhad concealed from me became apparent; an idea came into my mind which had\nnot existed for me a moment earlier, framed itself in words in my head;\nand the pleasure with which the first sight of them, just now, had filled\nme was so much enhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I\ncould no longer think of anything but them. At this point, although we had\nnow travelled a long way from Martinville, I turned my head and caught\nsight of them again, quite black this time, for the sun had meanwhile set.\nEvery few minutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight; then\nthey shewed themselves for the last time, and so I saw them no more.",
        "Without admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of\nMartinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase, since it was\nin the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to me, I\nborrowed a pencil and some paper from the Doctor, and composed, in spite\nof the jolting of the carriage, to appease my conscience and to satisfy my\nenthusiasm, the following little fragment, which I have since discovered,\nand now reproduce, with only a slight revision here and there.",
        "Alone, rising from the level of the plain, and seemingly lost in that\nexpanse of open country, climbed to the sky the twin steeples of\nMartinville. Presently we saw three: springing into position confronting\nthem by a daring volt, a third, a dilatory steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, was\ncome to join them. The minutes passed, we were moving rapidly, and yet the\nthree steeples were always a long way ahead of us, like three birds\nperched upon the plain, motionless and conspicuous in the sunlight. Then\nthe steeple of Vieuxvicq withdrew, took its proper distance, and the\nsteeples of Martinville remained alone, gilded by the light of the setting\nsun, which, even at that distance, I could see playing and smiling upon\ntheir sloped sides. We had been so long in approaching them that I was\nthinking of the time that must still elapse before we could reach them\nwhen, of a sudden, the carriage, having turned a corner, set us down at\ntheir feet; and they had flung themselves so abruptly in our path that we\nhad barely time to stop before being dashed against the porch of the\nchurch.",
        "We resumed our course; we had left Martinville some little time, and the\nvillage, after accompanying us for a few seconds, had already disappeared,\nwhen, lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight, its steeples and\nthat of Vieuxvicq waved once again, in token of farewell, their sun-bathed\npinnacles.  Sometimes one would withdraw, so that the other two might\nwatch us for a moment still; then the road changed direction, they veered\nin the light like three golden pivots, and vanished from my gaze. But, a\nlittle later, when we were already close to Combray, the sun having set\nmeanwhile, I caught sight of them for the last time, far away, and seeming\nno more now than three flowers painted upon the sky above the low line of\nfields. They made me think, too, of three maidens in a legend, abandoned\nin a solitary place over which night had begun to fall; and while we drew\naway from them at a gallop, I could see them timidly seeking their way,\nand, after some awkward, stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes,\ndrawing close to one another, slipping one behind another, shewing nothing\nmore, now, against the still rosy sky than a single dusky form, charming\nand resigned, and so vanishing in the night.",
        "I never thought again of this page, but at the moment when, on my corner\nof the box-seat, where the Doctor’s coachman was in the habit of placing,\nin a hamper, the fowls which he had bought at Martinville market, I had\nfinished writing it, I found such a sense of happiness, felt that it had\nso entirely relieved my mind of the obsession of the steeples, and of the\nmystery which they concealed, that, as though I myself were a hen and had\njust laid an egg, I began to sing at the top of my voice.",
        "All day long, during these walks, I had been able to muse upon the\npleasure that there would be in the friendship of the Duchesse de\nGuermantes, in fishing for trout, in drifting by myself in a boat on the\nVivonne; and, greedy for happiness, I asked nothing more from life, in\nsuch moments, than that it should consist always of a series of joyous\nafternoons.  But when, on our way home, I had caught sight of a farm, on\nthe left of the road, at some distance from two other farms which were\nthemselves close together, and from which, to return to Combray, we need\nonly turn down an avenue of oaks, bordered on one side by a series of\norchard-closes, each one planted at regular intervals with apple-trees\nwhich cast upon the ground, when they were lighted by the setting sun, the\nJapanese stencil of their shadows; then, sharply, my heart would begin to\nbeat, I would know that in half an hour we should be at home, and that\nthere, as was the rule on days when we had taken the ’Guermantes way’ and\ndinner was, in consequence, served later than usual, I should be sent to\nbed as soon as I had swallowed my soup, so that my mother, kept at table,\njust as though there had been company to dinner, would not come upstairs\nto say good night to me in bed. The zone of melancholy which I then\nentered was totally distinct from that other zone, in which I had been\nbounding for joy a moment earlier, just as sometimes in the sky a band of\npink is separated, as though by a line invisibly ruled, from a band of\ngreen or black. You may see a bird flying across the pink; it draws near\nthe border-line, touches it, enters and is lost upon the black. The\nlongings by which I had just now been absorbed, to go to Guermantes, to\ntravel, to live a life of happiness–I was now so remote from them that\ntheir fulfilment would have afforded me no pleasure. How readily would I\nhave sacrificed them all, just to be able to cry, all night long, in the\narms of Mamma! Shuddering with emotion, I could not take my agonised eyes\nfrom my mother’s face, which was not to appear that evening in the bedroom\nwhere I could see myself already lying, in imagination; and wished only\nthat I were lying dead. And this state would persist until the morrow,\nwhen, the rays of morning leaning their bars of light, as the gardener\nmight lean his ladder, against the wall overgrown with nasturtiums, which\nclambered up it as far as my window-sill, I would leap out of bed to run\ndown at once into the garden, with no thought of the fact that evening\nmust return, and with it the hour when I must leave my mother. And so it\nwas from the ’Guermantes way’ that I learned to distinguish between these\nstates which reigned alternately in my mind, during certain periods, going\nso far as to divide every day between them, each one returning to\ndispossess the other with the regularity of a fever and ague: contiguous,\nand yet so foreign to one another, so devoid of means of communication,\nthat I could no longer understand, or even picture to myself, in one state\nwhat I had desired or dreaded or even done in the other.",
        "So the ’Méséglise way’ and the ’Guermantes way’ remain for me linked with\nmany of the little incidents of that one of all the divers lives along\nwhose parallel lines we are moved, which is the most abundant in sudden\nreverses of fortune, the richest in episodes; I mean the life of the mind.\nDoubtless it makes in us an imperceptible progress, and the truths which\nhave changed for us its meaning and its aspect, which have opened new\npaths before our feet, we had for long been preparing for their discovery;\nbut that preparation was unconscious; and for us those truths date only\nfrom the day, from the minute when they became apparent. The flowers which\nplayed then among the grass, the water which rippled past in the sunshine,\nthe whole landscape which served as environment to their apparition\nlingers around the memory of them still with its unconscious or unheeding\nair; and, certainly, when they were slowly scrutinised by this humble\npasser-by, by this dreaming child–as the face of a king is scrutinised by\na petitioner lost in the crowd–that scrap of nature, that corner of a\ngarden could never suppose that it would be thanks to him that they would\nbe elected to survive in all their most ephemeral details; and yet the\nscent of hawthorn which strays plundering along the hedge from which, in a\nlittle while, the dog-roses will have banished it, a sound of footsteps\nfollowed by no echo, upon a gravel path, a bubble formed at the side of a\nwaterplant by the current, and formed only to burst–my exaltation of mind\nhas borne them with it, and has succeeded in making them traverse all\nthese successive years, while all around them the one-trodden ways have\nvanished, while those who thronged those ways, and even the memory of\nthose who thronged those trodden ways, are dead. Sometimes the fragment of\nlandscape thus transported into the present will detach itself in such\nisolation from all associations that it floats uncertainly upon my mind,\nlike a flowering isle of Delos, and I am unable to say from what place,\nfrom what time–perhaps, quite simply, from which of my dreams–it comes.\nBut it is pre-eminently as the deepest layer of my mental soil, as firm\nsites on which I still may build, that I regard the Méséglise and\nGuermantes ’ways.’ It is because I used to think of certain things, of\ncertain people, while I was roaming along them, that the things, the\npeople which they taught me to know, and these alone, I still take\nseriously, still give me joy. Whether it be that the faith which creates\nhas ceased to exist in me, or that reality will take shape in the memory\nalone, the flowers that people shew me nowadays for the first time never\nseem to me to be true flowers. The ’Méséglise way’ with its lilacs, its\nhawthorns, its cornflowers, its poppies, its apple-trees, the ’Guermantes\nway’ with its river full of tadpoles, its water-lilies, and its buttercups\nhave constituted for me for all time the picture of the land in which I\nfain would pass my life, in which my only requirements are that I may go\nout fishing, drift idly in a boat, see the ruins of a gothic fortress in\nthe grass, and find hidden among the cornfields–as Saint-André-des-Champs\nlay hidden–an old church, monumental, rustic, and yellow like a\nmill-stone; and the cornflowers, the hawthorns, the apple-trees which I\nmay happen, when I go walking, to encounter in the fields, because they\nare situated at the same depth, on the level of my past life, at once\nestablish contact with my heart. And yet, because there is an element of\nindividuality in places, when I am seized with a desire to see again the\n’Guermantes way,’ it would not be satisfied were I led to the banks of a\nriver in which were lilies as fair, or even fairer than those in the\nVivonne, any more than on my return home in the evening, at the hour when\nthere awakened in me that anguish which, later on in life, transfers\nitself to the passion of love, and may even become its inseparable\ncompanion, I should have wished for any strange mother to come in and say\ngood night to me, though she were far more beautiful and more intelligent\nthan my own. No: just as the one thing necessary to send me to sleep\ncontented (in that untroubled peace which no mistress, in later years, has\never been able to give me, since one has doubts of them at the moment when\none believes in them, and never can possess their hearts as I used to\nreceive, in her kiss, the heart of my mother, complete, without scruple or\nreservation, unburdened by any liability save to myself) was that it\nshould be my mother who came, that she should incline towards me that face\non which there was, beneath her eye, something that was, it appears, a\nblemish, and which I loved as much as all the rest–so what I want to see\nagain is the ’Guermantes way’ as I knew it, with the farm that stood a\nlittle apart from the two neighbouring farms, pressed so close together,\nat the entrance to the oak avenue; those meadows upon whose surface, when\nit is polished by the sun to the mirroring radiance of a lake, are\noutlined the leaves of the apple-trees; that whole landscape whose\nindividuality sometimes, at night, in my dreams, binds me with a power\nthat is almost fantastic, of which I can discover no trace when I awake.",
        "No doubt, by virtue of having permanently and indissolubly combined in me\ngroups of different impressions, for no reason save that they had made me\nfeel several separate things at the same time, the Méséglise and\nGuermantes ’ways’ left me exposed, in later life, to much disillusionment,\nand even to many mistakes. For often I have wished to see a person again\nwithout realising that it was simply because that person recalled to me a\nhedge of hawthorns in blossom; and I have been led to believe, and to make\nsome one else believe in an aftermath of affection, by what was no more\nthan an inclination to travel. But by the same qualities, and by their\npersistence in those of my impressions, to-day, to which they can find an\nattachment, the two ’ways’ give to those impressions a foundation, depth,\na dimension lacking from the rest. They invest them, too, with a charm, a\nsignificance which is for me alone. When, on a summer evening, the\nresounding sky growls like a tawny lion, and everyone is complaining of\nthe storm, it is along the ’Méséglise way’ that my fancy strays alone in\necstasy, inhaling, through the noise of falling rain, the odour of\ninvisible and persistent lilac-trees.",
        "And so I would often lie until morning, dreaming of the old days at\nCombray, of my melancholy and wakeful evenings there; of other days\nbesides, the memory of which had been more lately restored to me by the\ntaste–by what would have been called at Combray the ’perfume’–-of a cup\nof tea; and, by an association of memories, of a story which, many years\nafter I had left the little place, had been told me of a love affair in\nwhich Swann had been involved before I was born; with that accuracy of\ndetail which it is easier, often, to obtain when we are studying the lives\nof people who have been dead for centuries than when we are trying to\nchronicle those of our own most intimate friends, an accuracy which it\nseems as impossible to attain as it seemed impossible to speak from one\ntown to another, before we learned of the contrivance by which that\nimpossibility has been overcome. All these memories, following one after\nanother, were condensed into a single substance, but had not so far\ncoalesced that I could not discern between the three strata, between my\noldest, my instinctive memories, those others, inspired more recently by a\ntaste or ’perfume,’ and those which were actually the memories of another,\nfrom whom I had acquired them at second hand–no fissures, indeed, no\ngeological faults, but at least those veins, those streaks of colour which\nin certain rocks, in certain marbles, point to differences of origin, age,\nand formation.",
        "It is true that, when morning drew near, I would long have settled the\nbrief uncertainty of my waking dream, I would know in what room I was\nactually lying, would have reconstructed it round about me in the\ndarkness, and–fixing my orientation by memory alone, or with the\nassistance of a feeble glimmer of light at the foot of which I placed the\ncurtains and the window–would have reconstructed it complete and with its\nfurniture, as an architect and an upholsterer might do, working upon an\noriginal, discarded plan of the doors and windows; would have replaced the\nmirrors and set the chest-of-drawers on its accustomed site. ’But scarcely\nhad daylight itself–and no longer the gleam from a last, dying ember on a\nbrass curtain-rod, which I had mistaken for daylight–traced across the\ndarkness, as with a stroke of chalk across a blackboard, its first white\ncorrecting ray, when the window, with its curtains, would leave the frame\nof the doorway, in which I had erroneously placed it, while, to make room\nfor it, the writing-table, which my memory had clumsily fixed where the\nwindow ought to be, would hurry off at full speed, thrusting before it the\nmantelpiece, and sweeping aside the wall of the passage; the well of the\ncourtyard would be enthroned on the spot where, a moment earlier, my\ndressing-room had lain, and the dwelling-place which I had built up for\nmyself in the darkness would have gone to join all those other dwellings\nof which I had caught glimpses from the whirlpool of awakening; put to\nflight by that pale sign traced above my window-curtains by the uplifted\nforefinger of day.",
