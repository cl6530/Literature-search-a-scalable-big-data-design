        "Lincoln stands on a hill surrounded by level country. First a British\nsettlement, it became a Roman colony. In 1074 the decree that all\nbishoprics should be in fortified places caused the removal of the See\nof Dorchester to Lincoln. Even at this time Lincoln was an important\ncommercial town. Many parliaments have been held in its chapter-house,\nand Henry VII. offered his thanksgivings after Bosworth in the\ncathedral.",
        "The mighty fane, with its three massive towers, rises majestically over\nthe red roofs of the town. Its most striking feature is the great Norman\nscreen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and\nhiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west\nfront. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first\nbishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and\nEarly English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were\nremoved in 1807.",
        "In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of\nRemigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and\neastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and\nbegan the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in\nrebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could\nnot rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by\nRemigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond\nto that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting\nis a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb\nbeauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no\ndoubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of\nGothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is\nremarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the\ndim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.",

        "The original Norman building was built by Remigius, but the structure\nhaving been weakened by an earthquake shock, Hugh of Avalon in 1192\nbuilt the Choir and Eastern Transept, and his successors finished the\nwork.]",
