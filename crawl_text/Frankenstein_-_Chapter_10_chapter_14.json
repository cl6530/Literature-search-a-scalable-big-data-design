        "I spent the following day roaming through the valley.  I stood beside\nthe sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that\nwith slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to\nbarricade the valley.  The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before\nme; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were\nscattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\npresence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling\nwaves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\navalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\naccumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\nwas ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\ntheir hands.  These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\ngreatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.  They elevated me\nfrom all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my\ngrief, they subdued and tranquillized it.  In some degree, also, they\ndiverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\nlast month.  I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\nwaited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\nhad contemplated during the day.  They congregated round me; the\nunstained snowy mountaintop, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\nand ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds–they all\ngathered round me and bade me be at peace.",
        "Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?  All of soul-\ninspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought.\nThe rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of\nthe mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty\nfriends.  Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in\ntheir cloudy retreats.  What were rain and storm to me?  My mule was\nbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\nMontanvert.  I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\nand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. \nIt had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\nsoul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.\nThe sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\neffect of solemnizing my mind and causing me to forget the passing\ncares of life.  I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\nacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\nsolitary grandeur of the scene.",
        "The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\nmountain.  It is a scene terrifically desolate.  In a thousand spots\nthe traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\nbroken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,\nleaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\nother trees.  The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines\nof snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\nparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking\nin a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker.  The pines are not tall or\nluxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the\nscene.  I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the\nrivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the\nopposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while\nrain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I\nreceived from the objects around me.  Alas!  Why does man boast of\nsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\nthem more necessary beings.  If our impulses were confined to hunger,\nthirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by\nevery wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may\nconvey to us.",
        " We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.\n  We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.\n We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,\n  Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\n It is the same:  for, be it joy or sorrow,\n  The path of its departure still is free.\n Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;\n  Nought may endure but mutability!",
        "It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.  For some\ntime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.  A mist covered\nboth that and the surrounding mountains.  Presently a breeze dissipated\nthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.  The surface is very\nuneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\ninterspersed by rifts that sink deep.  The field of ice is almost a\nleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.  The\nopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.  From the side where I\nnow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\nand above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.  I remained in a recess\nof the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.  The sea,\nor rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,\nwhose aerial summits hung over its recesses.  Their icy and glittering\npeaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.  My heart, which was\nbefore sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,\n“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow\nbeds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,\naway from the joys of life.”",
        "As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\nadvancing towards me with superhuman speed.  He bounded over the\ncrevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his\nstature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.  I was\ntroubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,\nbut I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.  I\nperceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)\nthat it was the wretch whom I had created.  I trembled with rage and\nhorror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in\nmortal combat.  He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,\ncombined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness\nrendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.  But I scarcely\nobserved this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,\nand I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious\ndetestation and contempt.",
        "“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me?  And do not you fear\nthe fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?  Begone,\nvile insect!  Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust!  And,\noh!  That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence,\nrestore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”",
        "“I expected this reception,” said the daemon.  “All men hate the\nwretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all\nliving things!  Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,\nto whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of\none of us.  You purpose to kill me.  How dare you sport thus with\nlife?  Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the\nrest of mankind.  If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave\nthem and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death,\nuntil it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”",
        "“Abhorred monster!  Fiend that thou art!  The tortures of hell are too\nmild a vengeance for thy crimes.  Wretched devil!  You reproach me with\nyour creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I\nso negligently bestowed.”",
        "My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the\nfeelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.",
        "He easily eluded me and said,",
        "“Be calm!  I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred\non my devoted head.  Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to\nincrease my misery?  Life, although it may only be an accumulation of\nanguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.  Remember, thou hast made\nme more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my\njoints more supple.  But I will not be tempted to set myself in\nopposition to thee.  I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and\ndocile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,\nthe which thou owest me.  Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every\nother and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy\nclemency and affection, is most due.  Remember that I am thy creature;\nI ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou\ndrivest from joy for no misdeed.  Everywhere I see bliss, from which I\nalone am irrevocably excluded.  I was benevolent and good; misery made\nme a fiend.  Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”",
        "“Begone!  I will not hear you.  There can be no community between you\nand me; we are enemies.  Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,\nin which one must fall.”",
        "“How can I move thee?  Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a\nfavourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and\ncompassion?  Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed\nwith love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?  You, my\ncreator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,\nwho owe me nothing?  They spurn and hate me.  The desert mountains and\ndreary glaciers are my refuge.  I have wandered here many days; the\ncaves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the\nonly one which man does not grudge.  These bleak skies I hail, for they\nare kinder to me than your fellow beings.  If the multitude of mankind\nknew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for\nmy destruction.  Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?  I will keep\nno terms with my enemies.  I am miserable, and they shall share my\nwretchedness.  Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver\nthem from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that\nnot only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be\nswallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.  Let your compassion be\nmoved, and do not disdain me.  Listen to my tale; when you have heard\nthat, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.\nBut hear me.  The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they\nare, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.  Listen\nto me, Frankenstein.  You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with\na satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.  Oh, praise the\neternal justice of man!  Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,\nand then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”",
        "“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of\nwhich I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and\nauthor?  Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw\nlight!  Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you! \nYou have made me wretched beyond expression.  You have left me no power\nto consider whether I am just to you or not.  Begone!  Relieve me from\nthe sight of your detested form.”",
        "“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands\nbefore my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from\nthee a sight which you abhor.  Still thou canst listen to me and grant\nme thy compassion.  By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this\nfrom you.  Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of\nthis place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon\nthe mountain.  The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends\nto hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another\nworld, you will have heard my story and can decide.  On you it rests,\nwhether I quit forever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless\nlife, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of\nyour own speedy ruin.”",
        "As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.  My heart\nwas full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the\nvarious arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to\nhis tale.  I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my\nresolution.  I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my\nbrother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this\nopinion.  For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator\ntowards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before\nI complained of his wickedness.  These motives urged me to comply with\nhis demand.  We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite\nrock.  The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we\nentered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy\nheart and depressed spirits.  But I consented to listen, and seating\nmyself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began\nhis tale.",
