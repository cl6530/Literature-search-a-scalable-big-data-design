        "The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit\nthrew Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor\ncould she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than\nincessantly.  Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken\nthe trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose\nof breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.  It was\na rational scheme, to be sure!  but from what the report of\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to\nimagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate\nfriend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was\nenough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made\neverybody eager for another, to supply the idea.  She had not\nherself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must\nbring them more frequently together.  And her neighbours at\nLucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with\nthe Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady\nCatherine), had only set that down as almost certain and\nimmediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at\nsome future time.",
        "In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could\nnot help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence\nof her persisting in this interference.  From what she had said\nof her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to\nElizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;\nand how he might take a similar representation of the evils\nattached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.\nShe knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or\nhis dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could\ndo; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a\nmarriage with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal\nto his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.\nWith his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the\narguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous,\ncontained much good sense and solid reasoning.",
        "If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which\nhad often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a\nrelation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to\nbe as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.  In that\ncase he would return no more.  Lady Catherine might see him in\nher way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming\nagain to Netherfield must give way.",
        "“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should\ncome to his friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall\nknow how to understand it.  I shall then give over every\nexpectation, every wish of his constancy.  If he is satisfied\nwith only regretting me, when he might have obtained my\naffections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.”",
        "                          * * * * *",
        "The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their\nvisitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\nit, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased\nMrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much\nteasing on the subject.",
        "The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by\nher father, who came out of his library with a letter in his\nhand.",
        "“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my\nroom.”",
        "She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he\nhad to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being\nin some manner connected with the letter he held.  It suddenly\nstruck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she\nanticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.",
        "She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\ndown.  He then said,",
        "“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\nexceedingly.  As it principally concerns yourself, you ought\nto know its contents.  I did not know before, that I had two\ndaughters on the brink of matrimony.  Let me congratulate you\non a very important conquest.”",
        "The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the\naunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that\nhe explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not\nrather addressed to herself; when her father continued:",
        "“You look conscious.  Young ladies have great penetration in\nsuch matters as these; but I think I may defy even yoursagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.  This letter\nis from Mr. Collins.”",
        "“From Mr. Collins! and what can he have to say?”",
        "“Something very much to the purpose of course.  He begins with\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter,\nof which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured,\ngossiping Lucases.  I shall not sport with your impatience, by\nreading what he says on that point.  What relates to yourself, is\nas follows:  ’Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations\nof Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add\na short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been\nadvertised by the same authority.  Your daughter Elizabeth, it is\npresumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder\nsister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be\nreasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages\nin this land.’",
        "“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?”  ’This\nyoung gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing\nthe heart of mortal can most desire,–splendid property,\nnoble kindred, and extensive patronage.  Yet in spite of all\nthese temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and\nyourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure\nwith this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.’",
        "“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?  But now it\ncomes out:",
        "“’My motive for cautioning you is as follows.  We have reason to\nimagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look\non the match with a friendly eye.’",
        "“_Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man!  Now, Lizzy, I think I\nhave surprised you.  Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched\non any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name\nwould have given the lie more effectually to what they related?\nMr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish,\nand who probably never looked at you in his life!  It is\nadmirable!”",
        "Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could\nonly force one most reluctant smile.  Never had his wit been\ndirected in a manner so little agreeable to her.",
        "“Are you not diverted?”",
        "“Oh! yes.  Pray read on.”",
        "“’After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship\nlast night, she immediately, with her usual condescension,\nexpressed what she felt on the occasion; when it become apparent,\nthat on the score of some family objections on the part of my\ncousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so\ndisgraceful a match.  I thought it my duty to give the speediest\nintelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble\nadmirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’\nMr. Collins moreover adds, ’I am truly rejoiced that my cousin\nLydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only\nconcerned that their living together before the marriage took\nplace should be so generally known.  I must not, however,\nneglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my\namazement at hearing that you received the young couple into\nyour house as soon as they were married.  It was an encouragement\nof vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very\nstrenuously have opposed it.  You ought certainly to forgive them,\nas a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow\ntheir names to be mentioned in your hearing.’  That is his notion\nof Christian forgiveness!  The rest of his letter is only about\nhis dear Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young\nolive-branch.  But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.\nYou are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be\naffronted at an idle report.  For what do we live, but to make\nsport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?”",
        "“Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted.  But it is\nso strange!”",
        "“Yes–that is what makes it amusing.  Had they fixed on any other\nman it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference,\nand your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!  Much\nas I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s\ncorrespondence for any consideration.  Nay, when I read a letter\nof his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham,\nmuch as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.\nAnd pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?\nDid she call to refuse her consent?”",
        "To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and\nas it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not\ndistressed by his repeating it.  Elizabeth had never been\nmore at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.\nIt was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.\nHer father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of\nMr. Darcy’s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder\nat such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead\nof his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.",
