        "We ascended the stairs and viewed the body.  Miss Brenda\nTregennis had been a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon\nmiddle age.  Her dark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in\ndeath, but there still lingered upon it something of that\nconvulsion of horror which had been her last human emotion.  From\nher bedroom we descended to the sitting-room, where this strange\ntragedy had actually occurred.  The charred ashes of the\novernight fire lay in the grate.  On the table were the four\nguttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered over\nits surface.  The chairs had been moved back against the walls,\nbut all else was as it had been the night before.  Holmes paced\nwith light, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various\nchairs, drawing them up and reconstructing their positions.  He\ntested how much of the garden was visible; he examined the floor,\nthe ceiling, and the fireplace; but never once did I see that\nsudden brightening of his eyes and tightening of his lips which\nwould have told me that he saw some gleam of light in this utter\ndarkness.",
        "“Why a fire?” he asked once.  “Had they always a fire in this\nsmall room on a spring evening?”",
        "Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp.\nFor that reason, after his arrival, the fire was lit.  “What are\nyou going to do now, Mr. Holmes?” he asked.",
        "My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm.  “I think,\nWatson, that I shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning\nwhich you have so often and so justly condemned,” said he.  “With\nyour permission, gentlemen, we will now return to our cottage,\nfor I am not aware that any new factor is likely to come to our\nnotice here.  I will turn the facts over in my mid, Mr,\nTregennis, and should anything occur to me I will certainly\nommunicate with you and the vicar.  In the meantime I wish you\nboth good-morning.”",
        "It was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that\nHolmes broke his complete and absorbed silence.  He sat coiled in\nhis armchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid\nthe blue swirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down,\nhis forehead contracted, his eyes vacant and far away.  Finally\nhe laid down his pipe and sprang to his feet.",
        "“It won’t do, Watson!” said he with a laugh.  “Let us walk along\nthe cliffs together and search for flint arrows.  We are more\nlikely to find them than clues to this problem.  To let the brain\nwork without sufficient material is like racing an engine.  It\nracks itself to pieces.  The sea air, sunshine, and patience,\nWatson—all else will come.",
        "“Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,” he continued as\nwe skirted the cliffs together.  “Let us get a firm grip of the\nvery little which we DO know, so that when fresh facts arise we\nmay be ready to fit them into their places.  I take it, in the\nfirst place, that neither of us is prepared to admit diabolical\nintrusions into the affairs of men.  Let us begin by ruling that\nentirely out of our minds.  Very good.  There remain three\npersons who have been grievously stricken by some conscious or\nunconscious human agency.  That is firm ground.  Now, when did\nthis occur?  Evidently, assuming his narrative to be true, it was\nimmediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left the room.  That\nis a very important point.  The presumption is that it was within\na few minutes afterwards.  The cards still lay upon the table.\nIt was already past their usual hour for bed.  Yet they had not\nchanged their position or pushed back their chairs.  I repeat,\nthen, that the occurrence was immediately after his departure,\nand not later than eleven o’clock last night.",
        "“Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the\nmovements of Mortimer Tregennis after he left the room.  In this\nthere is no difficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion.\nKnowing my methods as you do, you were, of course, conscious of\nthe somewhat clumsy water-pot expedient by which I obtained a\nclearer impress of his foot than might otherwise have been\npossible.  The wet, sandy path took it admirably.  Last night was\nalso wet, you will remember, and it was not difficult—having\nobtained a sample print—to pick out his track among others and\nto follow his movements.  He appears to have walked away swiftly\nin the direction of the vicarage.",
        "“If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet\nsome outside person affected the card-players, how can we\nreconstruct that person, and how was such an impression of horror\nconveyed?  Mrs. Porter may be eliminated.  She is evidently\nharmless.  Is there any evidence that someone crept up to the\ngarden window and in some manner produced so terrific an effect\nthat he drove those who saw it out of their senses?  The only\nsuggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer Tregennis\nhimself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement in\nthe garden.  That is certainly remarkable, as the night was\nrainy, cloudy, and dark.  Anyone who had the design to alarm\nthese people would be compelled to place his very face against\nthe glass before he could be seen.  There is a three-foot flower-\nborder outside this window, but no indication of a footmark.  It\nis difficult to imagine, then, how an outsider could have made so\nterrible an impression upon the company, nor have we found any\npossible motive for so strange and elaborate an attempt.  You\nperceive our difficulties, Watson?”",
        "“They are only too clear,” I answered with conviction.",
        "“And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are\nnot insurmountable,” said Holmes.  “I fancy that among your\nextensive archives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly\nas obscure.  Meanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more\naccurate data are available, and devote the rest of our morning\nto the pursuit of neolithic man.”",
        "I may have commented upon my friend’s power of mental detachment,\nbut never have I wondered at it more than upon that spring\nmorning in Cornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts,\narrowheads, and shards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were\nwaiting for his solution.  It was not until we had returned in\nthe afternoon to our cottage that we found a visitor awaiting us,\nwho soon brought our minds back to the matter in hand.  Neither\nof us needed to be told who that visitor was.  The huge body, the\ncraggy and deeply seamed face with the fierce eyes and hawk-like\nnose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed our cottage ceiling,\nthe beard—golden at the fringes and white near the lips, save\nfor the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar—all these were\nas well known in London as in Africa, and could only be\nassociated with the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale,\nthe great lion-hunter and explorer.",
        "We had heard of his presence in the district and had once or\ntwice caught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths.\nHe made no advances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of\ndoing so to him, as it was well known that it was his love of\nseclusion which caused him to spend the greater part of the\nintervals between his journeys in a small bungalow buried in the\nlonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance.  Here, amid his books and his\nmaps, he lived an absolutely lonely life, attending to his own\nsimple wants and paying little apparent heed to the affairs of\nhis neighbours.  It was a surprise to me, therefore, to hear him\nasking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any advance\nin his reconstruction of this mysterious episode.  “The county\npolice are utterly at fault,” said he, “but perhaps your wider\nexperience has suggested some conceivable explanation.  My only\nclaim to being taken into your confidence is that during my many\nresidences here I have come to know this family of Tregennis very\nwell—indeed, upon my Cornish mother’s side I could call them\ncousins—and their strange fate has naturally been a great shock\nto me.  I may tell you that I had got as far as Plymouth upon my\nway to Africa, but the news reached me this morning, and I came\nstraight back again to help in the inquiry.”",
        "Holmes raised his eyebrows.",
        "“Did you lose your boat through it?”",
        "“I will take the next.”",
        "“Dear me! that is friendship indeed.”",
        "“I tell you they were relatives.”",
        "“Quite so—cousins of your mother.  Was your baggage aboard the\nship?”",
        "“Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.”",
        "“I see.  But surely this event could not have found its way into\nthe Plymouth morning papers.”",
        "“No, sir; I had a telegram.”",
        "“Might I ask from whom?”",
        "A shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.",
        "“You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.”",
        "“It is my business.”",
        "With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.",
        "“I have no objection to telling you,” he said.  “It was Mr.\nRoundhay, the vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.”",
        "“Thank you,” said Holmes.  “I may say in answer to your original\nquestion that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject\nof this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some\nconclusion.  It would be premature to say more.”",
        "“Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point\nin any particular direction?”",
        "“No, I can hardly answer that.”",
        "“Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.”  The\nfamous doctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-\nhumour, and within five minutes Holmes had followed him.  I saw\nhim no more until the evening, when he returned with a slow step\nand haggard face which assured me that he had made no great\nprogress with his investigation.  He glanced at a telegram which\nawaited him and threw it into the grate.",
        "“From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,” he said.  “I learned the name\nof it from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon\nSterndale’s account was true.  It appears that he did indeed\nspend last night there, and that he has actually allowed some of\nhis baggage to go on to Africa, while he returned to be present\nat this investigation.  What do you make of that, Watson?”",
        "“He is deeply interested.”",
        "“Deeply interested—yes.  There is a thread here which we had not\nyet grasped and which might lead us through the tangle.  Cheer\nup, Watson, for I am very sure that our material has not yet all\ncome to hand.  When it does we may soon leave our difficulties\nbehind us.”",
        "Little did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be\nrealized, or how strange and sinister would be that new\ndevelopment which opened up an entirely fresh line of\ninvestigation.  I was shaving at my window in the morning when I\nheard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a dog-cart coming\nat a gallop down the road.  It pulled up at our door, and our\nfriend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden path.\nHolmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him.",
        "Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but\nat last in gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.",
        "“We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes!  My poor parish is devil-\nridden!” he cried.  “Satan himself is loose in it!  We are given\nover into his hands!”  He danced about in his agitation, a\nludicrous object if it were not for his ashy face and startled\neyes.  Finally he shot out his terrible news.",
        "“Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly\nthe same symptoms as the rest of his family.”",
        "Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.",
        "“Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?”",
        "“Yes, I can.”",
        "“Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast.  Mr. Roundhay, we\nare entirely at your disposal.  Hurry—hurry, before things get\ndisarranged.”",
        "The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an\nangle by themselves, the one above the other.  Below was a large\nsitting-room; above, his bedroom.  They looked out upon a croquet\nlawn which came up to the windows.  We had arrived before the\ndoctor or the police, so that everything was absolutely\nundisturbed.  Let me describe exactly the scene as we saw it upon\nthat misty March morning.  It has left an impression which can\nnever be effaced from my mind.",
        "The atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing\nstuffiness.  The servant had first entered had thrown up the\nwindow, or it would have been even more intolerable.  This might\npartly be due to the fact that a lamp stood flaring and smoking\non the centre table.  Beside it sat the dead man, leaning back in\nhis chair, his thing beard projecting, his spectacles pushed up\non to his forehead, and his lean dark face turned towards the\nwindow and twisted into the same distortion of terror which had\nmarked the features of his dead sister.  His limbs were convulsed\nand his fingers contorted as though he had died in a very\nparoxysm of fear.  He was fully clothed, though there were signs\nthat his dressing had been done in a hurry.  We had already\nlearned that his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end\nhad come to him in the early morning.",
        "One realized the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes’s\nphlegmatic exterior when one saw the sudden change which came\nover him from the moment that he entered the fatal apartment.  In\nan instant he was tense and alert, his eyes shining, his face\nset, his limbs quivering with eager activity.  He was out on the\nlawn, in through the window, round the room, and up into the\nbedroom, for all the world like a dashing foxhound drawing a\ncover.  In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around and ended by\nthrowing open the window, which appeared to give him some fresh\ncause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud\nejaculations of interest and delight.  Then he rushed down the\nstair, out through the open window, threw himself upon his face\non the lawn, sprang up and into the room once more, all with the\nenergy of the hunter who is at the very heels of his quarry.  The\nlamp, which was an ordinary standard, he examined with minute\ncare, making certain measurements upon its bowl.  He carefully\nscrutinized with his lens the talc shield which covered the top\nof the chimney and scraped off some ashes which adhered to its\nupper surface, putting some of them into an envelope, which he\nplaced in his pocketbook.  Finally, just as the doctor and the\nofficial police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the vicar\nand we all three went out upon the lawn.",
        "“I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely\nbarren,” he remarked.  “I cannot remain to discuss the matter\nwith the police, but I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr.\nRoundhay, if you would give the inspector my compliments and\ndirect his attention to the bedroom window and to the sitting-\nroom lamp.  Each is suggestive, and together they are almost\nconclusive.  If the police would desire further information I\nshall be happy to see any of them at the cottage.  And now,\nWatson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed\nelsewhere.”",
        "It may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur,\nor that they imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of\ninvestigation; but it is certain that we heard nothing from them\nfor the next two days.  During this time Holmes spent some of his\ntime smoking and dreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion\nin country walks which he undertook alone, returning after many\nhours without remark as to where he had been.  One experiment\nserved to show me the line of his investigation.  He had bought a\nlamp which was the duplicate of the one which had burned in the\nroom of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of the tragedy.  This\nhe filled with the same oil as that used at the vicarage, and he\ncarefully timed the period which it would take to be exhausted.\nAnother experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant nature,\nand one which I am not likely ever to forget.",
        "“You will remember, Watson,” he remarked one afternoon, “that\nthere is a single common point of resemblance in the varying\nreports which have reached us.  This concerns the effect of the\natmosphere of the room in each case upon those who had first\nentered it.  You will recollect that Mortimer Tregennis, in\ndescribing the episode of his last visit to his brother’s house,\nremarked that the doctor on entering the room fell into a chair?\nYou had forgotten?  Well I can answer for it that it was so.\nNow, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper,\ntold us that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had\nafterwards opened the window.  In the second case—that of\nMortimer Tregennis himself—you cannot have forgotten the\nhorrible stuffiness of the room when we arrived, though the\nservant had thrown open the window.  That servant, I found upon\ninquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed.  You will\nadmit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive.  In each\ncase there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere.  In each case,\nalso, there is combustion going on in the room—in the one case a\nfire, in the other a lamp.  The fire was needed, but the lamp was\nlit—as a comparison of the oil consumed will show—long after it\nwas broad daylight.  Why?  Surely because there is some\nconnection between three things—the burning, the stuffy\natmosphere, and, finally, the madness or death of those\nunfortunate people.  That is clear, is it not?”",
        "“It would appear so.”",
        "“At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis.  We will\nsuppose, then, that something was burned in each case which\nproduced an atmosphere causing strange toxic effects.  Very good.\nIn the first instance—that of the Tregennis family—this\nsubstance was placed in the fire.  Now the window was shut, but\nthe fire would naturally carry fumes to some extent up the\nchimney.  Hence one would expect the effects of the poison to be\nless than in the second case, where there was less escape for the\nvapour.  The result seems to indicate that it was so, since in\nthe first case only the woman, who had presumably the more\nsensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that\ntemporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect\nof the drug.  In the second case the result was complete.  The\nfacts, therefore, seem to bear out the theory of a poison which\nworked by combustion.",
        "“With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about\nin Mortimer Tregennis’s room to find some remains of this\nsubstance.  The obvious place to look was the talc shelf or\nsmoke-guard of the lamp. There, sure enough, I perceived a number\nof flaky ashes, and round the edges a fringe of brownish powder,\nwhich had not yet been consumed.  Half of this I took, as you\nsaw, and I placed it in an envelope.”",
        "“Why half, Holmes?”",
        "“It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the\nofficial police force.  I leave them all the evidence which I\nfound.  The poison still remained upon the talc had they the wit\nto find it.  Now, Watson, we will light our lamp; we will,\nhowever, take the precaution to open our window to avoid the\npremature decease of two deserving members of society, and you\nwill seat yourself near that open window in an armchair unless,\nlike a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to do with the\naffair.  Oh, you will see it out, will you?  I thought I knew my\nWatson.  This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may\nbe the same distance from the poison and face to face.  The door\nwe will leave ajar.  Each is now in a position to watch the other\nand to bring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem\nalarming.  Is that all clear?  Well, then, I take our powder—or\nwhat remains of it—from the envelope, and I lay it above the\nburning lamp.  So!  Now, Watson, let us sit down and await\ndevelopments.”",
        "They were not long in coming.  I had hardly settled in my chair\nbefore I was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and\nnauseous.  At the very first whiff of it my brain and my\nimagination were beyond all control.  A thick, black cloud\nswirled before my eyes, and my mind told me that in this cloud,\nunseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my appalled senses,\nlurked all that was vaguely horrible, all that was monstrous and\ninconceivably wicked in the universe.  Vague shapes swirled and\nswam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning of\nsomething coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the\nthreshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul.  A freezing\nhorror took possession of me.  I felt that my hair was rising,\nthat my eyes were protruding, that my mouth was opened, and my\ntongue like leather.  The turmoil within my brain was such that\nsomething must surely snap.  I tried to scream and was vaguely\naware of some hoarse croak which was my own voice, but distant\nand detached from myself  At the same moment, in some effort of\nescape, I broke through that cloud of despair and had a glimpse\nof Holmes’s face, white, rigid, and drawn with horror—the very\nlook which I had seen upon the features of the dead.  It was that\nvision which gave me an instant of sanity and of strength.  I\ndashed from my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we\nlurched through the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown\nourselves down upon the grass plot and were lying side by side,\nconscious only of the glorious sunshine which was bursting its\nway through the hellish cloud of terror which had girt us in.\nSlowly it rose from our souls like the mists from a landscape\nuntil peace and reason had returned, and we were sitting upon the\ngrass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with apprehension\nat each other to mark the last traces of that terrific experience\nwhich we had undergone.",
        "“Upon my word, Watson!” said Holmes at last with an unsteady\nvoice, “I owe you both my thanks and an apology.  It was an\nunjustifiable experiment even for one’s self, and doubly so for a\nfriend.  I am really very sorry.”",
        "“You know,” I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen\nso much of Holmes’s heart before, “that it is my greatest joy and\nprivilege to help you.”",
        "He relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein\nwhich was his habitual attitude to those about him.  “It would be\nsuperfluous to drive us mad, my dear Watson,” said he.  “A candid\nobserver would certainly declare that we were so already before\nwe embarked upon so wild an experiment.  I confess that I never\nimagined that the effect could be so sudden and so severe.”  He\ndashed into the cottage, and, reappearing with the burning lamp\nheld at full arm’s length, he threw it among a bank of brambles.\n“We must give the room a little time to clear.  I take it,\nWatson, that you have no longer a shadow of a doubt as to how\nthese tragedies were produced?”",
        "“None whatever.”",
        "“But the cause remains as obscure as before.  Come into the\narbour here and let us discuss it together.  That villainous\nstuff seems still to linger round my throat.  I think we must\nadmit that all the evidence points to this man, Mortimer\nTregennis, having been the criminal in the first tragedy, though\nhe was the victim in the second one.  We must remember, in the\nfirst place, that there is some story of a family quarrel,\nfollowed by a reconciliation.  How bitter that quarrel may have\nbeen, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell.   When I\nthink of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small\nshrewd, beady eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I\nshould judge to be of a particularly forgiving disposition.\nWell, in the next place, you will remember that this idea of\nsomeone moving in the garden, which took our attention for a\nmoment from the real cause of the tragedy, emanated from him.  He\nhad a motive in misleading us.  Finally, if he did not throw the\nsubstance into the fire at the moment of leaving the room, who\ndid do so?  The affair happened immediately after his departure.\nHad anyone else come in, the family would certainly have risen\nfrom the table.  Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did not\narrive after ten o’clock at night.  We may take it, then, that\nall the evidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.”",
        "“Then his own death was suicide!”",
        "“Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible\nsupposition.  The man who had the guilt upon his soul of having\nbrought such a fate upon his own family might well be driven by\nremorse to inflict it upon himself.  There are, however, some\ncogent reasons against it.  Fortunately, there is one man in\nEngland who knows all about it, and I have made arrangements by\nwhich we shall hear the facts this afternoon from his own lips.\nAh! he is a little before his time.  Perhaps you would kindly\nstep this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been conducing a\nchemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly\nfit for the reception of so distinguished a visitor.”",
        "I had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic\nfigure of the great African explorer appeared upon the path.  He\nturned in some surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we\nsat.",
        "“You sent for me, Mr. Holmes.  I had your note about an hour ago,\nand I have come, though I really do not know why I should obey\nyour summons.”",
        "“Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,” said\nHolmes.  “Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous\nacquiescence.  You will excuse this informal reception in the\nopen air, but my friend Watson and I have nearly furnished an\nadditional chapter to what the papers call the Cornish Horror,\nand we prefer a clear atmosphere for the present.  Perhaps, since\nthe matters which we have to discuss will affect you personally\nin a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we should talk\nwhere there can be no eavesdropping.”",
        "The explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my\ncompanion.",
        "“I am at a loss to know, sir,” he said, “what you can have to\nspeak about which affects me personally in a very intimate\nfashion.”",
        "“The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,” said Holmes.",
        "For a moment I wished that I were armed.  Sterndale’s fierce face\nturned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted,\npassionate veins started out in his forehead, while he sprang\nforward with clenched hands towards my companion.  Then he\nstopped, and with a violent effort he resumed a cold, rigid\ncalmness, which was, perhaps, more suggestive of danger than his\nhot-headed outburst.",
        "“I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,” said he,\n“that I have got into the way of being a law to myself.  You\nwould do well, Mr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire\nto do you an injury.”",
        "“Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale.\nSurely the clearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I\nhave sent for you and not for the police.”",
        "Sterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first\ntime in his adventurous life.  There was a calm assurance of\npower in Holmes’s manner which could not be withstood.  Our\nvisitor stammered for a moment, his great hands opening and\nshutting in his agitation.",
        "“What do you mean?” he asked at last.  “If this is bluff upon\nyour part, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your\nexperiment. Let us have no more beating about the bush.  What DO\nyou mean?”",
        "“I will tell you,” said Holmes, “and the reason why I tell you is\nthat I hope frankness may beget frankness.  What my next step may\nbe will depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.”",
        "“My defence?”",
        "“Yes, sir.”",
        "“My defence against what?”",
        "“Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.”",
        "Sterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.  “Upon my\nword, you are getting on,” said he.  “Do all your successes\ndepend upon this prodigious power of bluff?”",
        "“The bluff,” said Holmes sternly, “is upon your side, Dr. Leon\nSterndale, and not upon mine.  As a proof I will tell you some of\nthe facts upon which my conclusions are based.  Of your return\nfrom Plymouth, allowing much of your property to go on to Africa,\nI will say nothing save that it first informed me that you were\none of the factors which had to be taken into account in\nreconstructing this drama—”",
        "“I came back—”",
        "“I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and\ninadequate.  We will pass that.  You came down here to ask me\nwhom I suspected.  I refused to answer you. You then went to the\nvicarage, waited outside it for some time, and finally returned\nto your cottage.”",
        "“How do you know that?”",
        "“I followed you.”",
        "“I saw no one.”",
        "“That is what you may expect to see when I follow you.  You spent\na restless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans,\nwhich in the early morning you proceeded to put into execution.\nLeaving your door just as day was breaking, you filled your\npocket with some reddish gravel that was lying heaped beside your\ngate.”",
        "Sterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.",
        "“You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from\nthe vicarage.  You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of\nribbed tennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your\nfeet.  At the vicarage you passed through the orchard and the\nside hedge, coming out under the window of the lodger Tregennis.\nIt was now daylight, but the household was not yet stirring.  You\ndrew some of the gravel from your pocket, and you threw it up at\nthe window above you.”",
        "Sterndale sprang to his feet.",
        "“I believe that you are the devil himself!” he cried.",
        "Holmes smiled at the compliment.  “It took two, or possibly\nthree, handfuls before the lodger came to the window.  You\nbeckoned him to come down.  He dressed hurriedly and descended to\nhis sitting-room.  You entered by the window.  There was an\ninterview—a short one—during which you walked up and down the\nroom.  Then you passed out and closed the window, standing on the\nlawn outside smoking a cigar and watching what occurred.\nFinally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as you had\ncome.  Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and\nwhat were the motives for your actions?  If you prevaricate or\ntrifle with me, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass\nout of my hands forever.”",
        "Our visitor’s face had turned ashen gray as he listened to the\nwords of his accuser.  Now he sat for some time in thought with\nhis face sunk in his hands.  Then with a sudden impulsive gesture\nhe plucked a photograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on\nthe rustic table before us.",
        "“That is why I have done it,” said he.",
        "It showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman.  Holmes\nstooped over it.",
        "“Brenda Tregennis,” said he.",
        "“Yes, Brenda Tregennis,” repeated our visitor.  “For years I have\nloved her.  For years she has loved me.  There is the secret of\nthat Cornish seclusion which people have marvelled at.  It has\nbrought me close to the one thing on earth that was dear to me.\nI could not marry her, for I have a wife who has left me for\nyears and yet whom, by the deplorable laws of England, I could\nnot divorce.  For years Brenda waited.  For years I waited.  And\nthis is what we have waited for.”  A terrible sob shook his great\nframe, and he clutched his throat under his brindled beard.  Then\nwith an effort he mastered himself and spoke on:",
        "“The vicar knew.  He was in our confidence.  He would tell you\nthat she was an angel upon earth.  That was why he telegraphed to\nme and I returned.  What was my baggage or Africa to me when I\nlearned that such a fate had come upon my darling?  There you\nhave the missing clue to my action, Mr. Holmes.”",
        "“Proceed,” said my friend.",
        "Dr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it\nupon the table.  On the outside was written “Radix pedis diaboli\"\nwith a red poison label beneath it.  He pushed it towards me.  “I\nunderstand that you are a doctor, sir.  Have you ever heard of\nthis preparation?”",
        "“Devil’s-foot root!  No, I have never heard of it.”",
        "“It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,” said he,\n“for I believe that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda,\nthere is no other specimen in Europe.  It has not yet found its\nway either into the pharmacopoeia or into the literature of\ntoxicology.  The root is shaped like a foot, half human, half\ngoatlike; hence the fanciful name given by a botanical\nmissionary.  It is used as an ordeal poison by the medicine-men\nin certain districts of West Africa and is kept as a secret among\nthem.  This particular specimen I obtained under very\nextraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country.”  He opened\nthe paper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown,\nsnuff-like powder.",
        "“Well, sir?” asked Holmes sternly.",
        "“I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred,\nfor you already know so much that it is clearly to my interest\nthat you should know all.  I have already explained the\nrelationship in which I stood to the Tregennis family. For the\nsake of the sister I was friendly with the brothers.  There was a\nfamily quarrel about money which estranged this man Mortimer, but\nit was supposed to be made up, and I afterwards met him as I did\nthe others.  He was a sly, subtle, scheming man, and several\nthings arose which gave me a suspicion of him, but I had no cause\nfor any positive quarrel.",
        "“One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage\nand I showed him some of my African curiosities.  Among other\nthings I exhibited this powder, and I told him of its strange\nproperties, how it stimulates those brain centres which control\nthe emotion of fear, and how either madness or death is the fate\nof the unhappy native who is subjected to the ordeal by the\npriest of his tribe.  I told him also how powerless European\nscience would be to detect it.  How he took it I cannot say, for\nI never left the room, but there is no doubt that it was then,\nwhile I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he\nmanaged to abstract some of the devil’s-foot root.  I well\nremember how he plied me with questions as to the amount and the\ntime that was needed for its effect, but I little dreamed that he\ncould have a personal reason for asking.",
        "“I thought no more of the matter until the vicar’s telegram\nreached me at Plymouth.  This villain had thought that I would be\nat sea before the news could reach me, and that I should be lost\nfor years in Africa.  But I returned at once.  Of course, I could\nnot listen to the details without feeling assured that my poison\nhad been used.  I came round to see you on the chance that some\nother explanation had suggested itself to you.  But there could\nbe none.  I was convinced that Mortimer Tregennis was the\nmurderer; that for the sake of money, and with the idea, perhaps,\nthat if the other members of his family were all insane he would\nbe the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the\ndevil’s-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their\nsenses, and killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I\nhave ever loved or who has ever loved me.  There was his crime;\nwhat was to be his punishment?",
        "“Should I appeal to the law?  Where were my proofs?  I knew that\nthe facts were true, but could I help to make a jury of\ncountrymen believe so fantastic a story?  I might or I might not.\nBut I could not afford to fail.  My soul cried out for revenge.\nI have said to you once before, Mr. Holmes, that I have spent\nmuch of my life outside the law, and that I have come at last to\nbe a law to myself.  So it was even now.  I determined that the\nfate which he had given to others should be shared by himself.\nEither that or I would do justice upon him with my own hand.  In\nall England there can be no man who sets less value upon his own\nlife than I do at the present moment.",
        "“Now I have told you all.  You have yourself supplied the rest.\nI did, as you say, after a restless night, set off early from my\ncottage.  I foresaw the difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered\nsome gravel from the pile which you have mentioned, and I used it\nto throw up to his window.  He came down and admitted me through\nthe window of the sitting-room.  I laid his offence before him.\nI told him that I had come both as judge and executioner.  The\nwretch sank into a chair, paralyzed at the sight of my revolver.\nI lit the lamp, put the powder above it, and stood outside the\nwindow, ready to carry out my threat to shoot him should he try\nto leave the room.  In five minutes he died.  My God! how he\ndied!  But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing which my\ninnocent darling had not felt before him.  There is my story, Mr.\nHolmes.  Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as\nmuch yourself.  At any rate, I am in your hands.  You can take\nwhat steps you like.  As I have already said, there is no man\nliving who can fear death less than I do.”",
        "Holmes sat for some little time in silence.",
        "“What were your plans?” he asked at last.",
        "“I had intended to bury myself in central Africa.  My work there\nis but half finished.”",
        "“Go and do the other half,” said Holmes.  “I, at least, am not\nprepared to prevent you.”",
        "Dr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked\nfrom the arbour.  Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.",
        "“Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,\"\nsaid he.  “I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case\nin which we are called upon to interfere.  Our investigation has\nbeen independent, and our action shall be so also.  You would not\ndenounce the man?”",
        "“Certainly not,” I answered.",
        "“I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I\nloved had met such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-\nhunter has done.  Who knows?  Well, Watson, I will not offend\nyour intelligence by explaining what is obvious.  The gravel upon\nthe window-sill was, of course, the starting-point of my\nresearch.  It was unlike anything in the vicarage garden.  Only\nwhen my attention had been drawn to Dr. Sterndale and his cottage\ndid I find its counterpart.  The lamp shining in broad daylight\nand the remains of powder upon the shield were successive links\nin a fairly obvious chain.  And now, my dear Watson, I think we\nmay dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear\nconscience to the study of those Chaldean roots which are surely\nto be traced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.”",
