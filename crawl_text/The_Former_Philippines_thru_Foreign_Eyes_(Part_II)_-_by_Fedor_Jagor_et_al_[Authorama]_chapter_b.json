        "[Population.] The enumeration of the natives for the assessment\nof tributes, in the manner ordained by the standing regulations\nof the Intendants of New Spain, is not observed in the Philippine\nIslands; nor indeed would this be an easy task. The wide extent of\nthe twenty-seven provinces of which they are composed, scattered, as\nthey are, through the great space comprehended between the southern\npart of Mindanao, and the almost desert islands known by the name of\nBatanes and Babuyanes, to the north of that of Luzon, presents almost\ninsurmountable obstacles, and in some measure affords an excuse for\nthe omission. Among these obstacles may be mentioned the necessity of\nwaiting for the favorable monsoon to set in, in order to perform the\nseveral voyages from one island to the other; the encumbered state\nof the grounds in many parts, the irregular and scattered situations\nof the settlements and dwellings, the variety among the natives and\ntheir dialects, the imperfect knowledge hitherto obtained of the\nrespective limits and extent of many districts, the general want of\nguides and auxiliaries, on whom reliance can be placed, and, above all,\nthe extreme repugnance the natives evince to the payment of tributes,\na circumstance which induces them to resort to all kinds of stratagems,\nin order to elude the vigilance of the collectors, and conceal their\nreal numbers.",
        "[Estimates.] The quinquennial census, as regularly enjoined, being\nthus found impracticable, no other means are left than to deduce from\nthe annual lists, transmitted by the district magistrates to the\nsuperintendent’s office, and those formed by the parish curates, a\nprudent estimate of the total number of inhabitants subject to our laws\nand religion; yet these data, although the only ones, and also the most\naccurate it is possible to obtain, for this reason, inspire so little\nconfidence, that it is necessary to use them with great caution. It is\nevident that all the district magistrates and curates do not possess\nthe same degree of care and minuteness in a research so important,\nand the omission or connivance of their respective delegates, more\nor less general, renders it probable that the number of tributes,\nnot included in the annual returns, is very considerable. If to\nthis we add the leged exemptions from tribute, justly granted to\nvarious individuals for a certain number of years, or during the\nperformance of special service, we shall easily be convinced of the\nimperfection of results, derived from such insecure principles. * * *\nI have carefully formed my estimates corresponding to the year 1810,\nand by confronting them with such data as I possess relating to the\npopulation of 1791, I have deduced the consoling assurance that,\nunder a parity of circumstances, the population of these Islands,\nfar from having diminished, has, in the interval, greatly increased.",
        "[Ratio to tributes.] From the collective returns recently made\nout by the district magistrates, it would appear that the total\nnumber of tributes amounts to 386,654, which multiplied by six and\none-half produces the sum of 2,515,406, at which I estimate the\ntotal population, including old men, women and children. I ought\nhere to observe, that I have chosen this medium of six and one-half\nbetween the five persons estimated in Spain and eight in the Indies,\nas constituting each family, or entire tribute; for although the\nprodigious fecundity of the women in the latter hemisphere, and the\nfacility of maintaining their numerous offspring, both the effects\nof the benignity of the climate and their sober way of living,\nsufficiently warrant the conclusion, that a greater number of persons\nenter into the composition of each family, I have, in this case, been\ninduced to pay deference to the observations of religious persons,\nintrusted with the care of souls, who have assured me that, whether\nit be owing to the great mortality prevailing among children, or\nthe influence of other local causes, in many districts each family,\nor entire tribute, does not exceed four and one-half persons.",
        "[Foreigners and wild tribes.] To the above amount it is necessary to\nadd 7,000 Sangleys (Chinese), who have been enumerated and subjected to\ntribute, for, although in the returns preserved in the public offices,\nthey are not rated at more than 4,700, there are ample reasons for\nconcluding, that many who are wandering about, or hidden in the\nprovinces, have eluded the general census. The European Spaniards,\nand Spanish creoles and mestizos, do not exceed 4,000 persons, of both\nsexes and all ages, and the distinct castes or modifications known in\nAmerica under the name of mulattos, quadroons, etc., although found\nin the Philippine Islands, are generally confounded in the three\nclasses of pure natives, Chinese mestizos, and Chinese. Besides the\nabove distinctions, various infidel and independent nations or tribes\nexist, more or less savage and ferocious, who have their dwellings in\nthe woods and glens, and are distinguished by the respective names of\nAetas, Ingolots, Negrillos, Igorots, Tinguianes, etc., nor is there\nscarcely a province in Luzon, that does not give shelter to some of\nthose isolated tribes, who inhabit and possess many of the mountainous\nranges, which ramificate and divide the wide and extended plains of\nthat beautiful island.",
        "[Origin of race.] The original race by which the Philippines are\npeopled, is beyond doubt Malayan, and the same that is observed\nin Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the other islands of this immense\narchipelago. The Philippine Islanders, very different from the\nMalabars, whose features possess great regularity, sweetness, and even\nbeauty, only resemble the latter in color, although they excel them in\nstature, and the good proportion of their limbs. The local population\nof the capital, in consequence of its continual communication with\nthe Chinese and other Asiatics, with the mariners of various nations,\nwith the soldiery and Mexican convicts, who are generally mulattos,\nand in considerable numbers sent to the Islands yearly in the way\nof transportation, has become a mixture of all kinds of nations and\nfeatures, or rather a degeneration from the primitive races.",
        "[Manila’s population.] Manila, the capital of the Philippine Islands,\nat present contains a population of from one hundred forty to one\nhundred fifty thousand inhabitants, of all classes; but it ought,\nhowever, to be understood, that in this computation are included\nthe populous suburbs of Santa Cruz, San Fernando, Binondo, Tondo,\nQuiapo, San Sebastian, San Anton, and Sampaloc; for although each is\nconsidered as a distinct town, having a separate curate, and civil\nmagistrate of its own, the subsequent union that has taken place rather\nmakes them appear as a prolongation of the city, divided into so many\nwards and parishes, in the center of which their respective churches\nare built. Among the chief provincial towns, several are found to\ncontain a population of from twenty to thirty thousand souls, and\nmany not less than ten to twelve thousaad. Finally, it is a generally\nreceived opinion that, besides the Moros and independent tribes, the\ntotal population of the Philippine Islands, subject to the authority\nof the king, is equal to three millions.",
        "[Cotton.] Among the varied productions of the Philippines, for many\nreasons, none is so deserving of attention as cotton. Its whiteness\nand find staple give to it such a superiority over that of the rest of\nAsia, and possibly of the world, that the Chinese anxiously seek it,\nin order pereferably to employ it in their most perfect textures,\nand purchase it thirty per cent dearer than the best from British\nIndia. Notwithstanding this extraordinary allurement, the vicinity\nof a good market, and the positive certainty that, however great the\nexportation, the growth can never equal the consumption and immense\ndemand for this article, it has, nevertheless, hitherto been found\nimpossible to extend and improve its cultivation, in such a way as to\nrender it a staple commodity of the country. Owing to this lamentable\nneglect, is it, that the annual exportation does not exceed five\nthousand “arrobas” (125,000 lbs.) whereas the British import into\nChina at the annual rate of 100,000 bales, or 1,200,000 “arrobas,\"\nproduced in their establishments at Bombay and Calcutta, and which,\nsold at the medium price of fifteen “taels,” for one hundred thirty\npounds, yield the net amount of $4,800,000.",
        "[Its advantages.] This want of attention to so important a branch\nof agriculture is the more to be regretted, as the Islands abound\nin situations peculiarly adapted for the cultivation of cotton, and\nthe accidental failure of the crops in some provinces, might easily\nbe made up by their success in others. The culture of this plant is\nbesides extremely easy, as it requires no other labor than clearing\nthe grounds from brush-wood, and lightly turning up the earth with a\nplough, before the seeds are scattered, which being done, the planter\nleaves the crop to its own chance, and in five months gathers abundant\nfruit, if, at the time the bud opens, it is not burnt by the north\nwinds, or rotted with unseasonable showers.",
        "[Restricted cultivation.] The provinces of Ilocos and Batangas\nare the only ones in which the cultivation of cotton is pursued\nwith any degree of zeal and care, and it greatly tends to enrich\nthe inhabitants. This successful example has not, however, hitherto\nexcited emulation in those of the other provinces; and thus the only\nproduction of the Philippine Islands, of which the excellence and\nsuperior demand in trade are as well known as its culture is easy,\nowing to strange fatality and causes which will be hereafter noticed,\nis left almost in a neglected state, or, at most, confined to the\nnarrow limits of local consumption.",
        "[Indigo.] Pangasinan, Pampanga, Bataan, La Laguna, Tayabas and\nCamarines produce indigo of various classes, and, although its\npreparation or the extraction of the dye, is in most of the above\nprovinces still performed in an equally imperfect manner, several\nsmall improvements have recently been made, which have bettered the\nquality, more particularly in La Laguna, the only district in which\nattempts have been made to imitate the process used in Guatemala,\nas well with regard to the construction and number of vats necessary,\nas the precipitation of the coloring particles–detached from the plant\nby the agitation of the water. In the other places, the whole of the\noperations are performed in a single vat, and the indigo obtained is\nnot unfrequently impregnated with lime and other extraneous substances.",
        "[Increasing culture.] Whatever may have been the causes of this evident\nbackwardness, from the period of the establishment of the Philippine\nCompany in these Islands, and in consequence of the exertions of some\nof the directors to promote the cultivation of indigo, at that time\nvery little known, the natives have slowly, though gradually, been\nreconciled to it; and discovering it to be one of the most advantageous\nbranches of industry, although accompanied with some labor and exposed\nto the influence of droughts and excessive heats, as well as to the\nrisks attendant on the extraordinary anticipation of the rainy seasons,\nhave of late years paid more attention to it. The quintal of indigo\nof the first class costs the planter from $35 to $40 at most; and in\nthe market of Manila it has been sold from $60 to $130, according to\nthe quality and the greater or lesser demand for the article at the\nseason. As, however, everything in this colony moves within a small\ncircle, it is not possible to obtain large quantities for exportation;\nnot only because of the risk in advancing the Indian sums of money\non account of his crop, but also owing to the annual surplus seldom\nexceeding from two to two thousand five hundred distributed in many\nhands, and collected by numerous agents, equally interested in making\nup their return-cargoes.",
        "[Sugar.] The cultivation of the sugar-cane is more or less extended\nto all the provinces of these Islands, owing to its consumption among\nthe natives being both great and general; but those of La Pampanga and\nPangasinan are more particularly devoted to it. These two provinces\nalone annually produce about 550,000 arrobas (13,750,000 lbs.) of\nwhich one-third is usually exported in Chinese and other foreign\nvessels. In extraordinary seasons, the amount exported greatly\nexceeds the quantity above stated, as, for example, happened in the\nmonsoon of 1796, when the planters came down to the port of Manila,\nand by contract exported upwards of nine millions weight, of the first\nand second qualities. The price of this article has experienced many\nvariations of late years; but the medium may be estimated at $6 for one\nhundred twenty-five pounds of the first quality, and $5 for the second.",
        "[Method of Manufacture.] The superior quality of the sugar of\nthe Philippines is acknowledged, when compared to that produced\nin the Island of Java, China, or Bengal; notwithstanding in the\nlatter countries it may naturally be concluded that greater pains\nand care are bestowed on its manufacture. The pressure of the cane\nin the Philippine Islands is performed by means of two coarse stone\ncylinders, placed on the ground, and moved in opposite directions by\nthe slow and unequal pace of a “carabao,” a species of ox or buffalo,\npeculiar to this and other Asiatic countries. The juice is conveyed to\nan iron caldron, and in this the other operations of boiling, skimming\nand cleansing take place, till the crystallization or adhering of\nthe sugar is completed. All these distinct parts of the process, in\nother colonies, are performed in four separate vessels, confided to\ndifferent hands, and consequently experience a much greater degree of\ncare and dexterity. After being properly clayed, the sugars acquire\nsuch a state of consistency that, when shipped in canvas bags, they\nbecome almost petrified in the course of the voyage, without moistening\nor purging, as I understand is the case with those of Bengal.",
        "[Silk.] Among the useful objects to which the Patriotic Society of\nManila (Amigos del Pais) directed their attention, from the very\nmoment of their formation, the planting of mulberry trees seems to\nhave met with peculiar encouragement. The society rightly judged that\nthe naturalization of so valuable a commodity as silk in these Islands\nwould materially increase the resources of the colony, and there was\nreason to hope that, besides local consumption, the growth might in\ntime be so much extended as to supply the wants of New Spain, which\nare not less than 80,000 lbs., amounting to from $350,000 to $400,000,\nconveyed there in the galleon annually sent to the port of Acapulco,\nby the Manila merchants, which article they are now compelled to\ncontract for in China.",
        "[Mulberry trees.] The Society gave the first impulse to this laudable\nproject, and then the governor of the Islands, Don José Basco, anxious\nto realize it, with this view sent Colonel Charles Conely on a special\ncommission to the province of Camarines. This zealous officer and\ndistrict magistrate, in the years 1786-1788 caused 4,485,782 mulberry\ntrees to be planted in the thirty districts under his jurisdiction;\nand incalculable are the happy results which would have attended a\nplan so extensive, and commenced with so much vigor, if it could have\nbeen continued with the same zeal by his successor, and not at once\ndestroyed, through a mistaken notion of humanity, with which, soon\nafter the departure of Governor Basco, they proceeded to exonerate\nthe Filipinos from all agricultural labor that was not free and\nspontaneous, in conformity, as was then alleged, to the general spirit\nof our Indian legislation. As it was natural to expect, the total\nabandonment of this valuable branch followed a measure so fatal, and\nnotwithstanding the efforts subsequently made by the Royal Company, in\norder to obtain its restoration, as well in Camarines as the Province\nof Tondo, all their exertions were in vain, though it must be allowed\nthat at the time several untoward circumstances contributed to thwart\ntheir anxious wishes. Notwithstanding this failure, the project, far\nfrom being deemed impracticable, would beyond all doubt succeed, and,\nunder powerful patronage, completely answer the well-founded hopes of\nits original conceivers and promoters. The natives themselves would\nsoon be convinced of the advantages to be derived from the possession\nof an article, in so many ways applicable to their own fine textures,\nand besides the variety of districts in the Islands, proved to be\nsuitable to the cultivation of this interesting tree, it is a known\nfact that many of the old mulberry groves are still in existence.",
        "[Beeswax.] The Bisayas, Cagayan, and many other provinces, produce wax\nin considerable abundance, which the Indians collect from the natural\nhives formed in the cavities of the trees, and it is also brought down\nby the infidel natives from the mountains to the neighboring towns. The\nquality certainly is not the best, and notwithstanding attempts have\nbeen made to cleanse it from the extraneous particles with which it\nis mixed, it always leaves a considerable sediment on the lower part\nof the cakes, and never acquires an entire whiteness. Its consumption\nis great, especially in the capital, and after supplying the wants of\nthe country, an annual surplus of from six hundred to eight hundred\nquintals is appropriated for exportation.",
        "[Neglected market.] This certainly might be converted into an article\nof extreme importance, especially for the kingdom of Peru, which\nin peaceable times receives its supplies from Spain, and even from\nthe Island of Cuba; but for this purpose it would be necessary to\nadopt the plan recommended by the enlightened zeal of the Patriotic\nSociety and previously encourage the establishment of artificial\nhives and the plantation of aromatic and flowering shrubs, which so\neasily attract and secure the permanency of the roving swarms, always\nready to undertake fresh labors. This, as well as many other points,\nhas hitherto been entirely overlooked.",
        "[Black pepper.] The production is cultivated in the Provinces of\nTayabas, Batangas, and La Laguna, but in such small quantities, that,\nnotwithstanding the powerful allurements of all kinds constantly held\nout by the Royal Company during the long period of twenty years,\ntheir agents have never been able to collect in more than about\n64,000 lbs. annually. After every encouragement, the most that\nhas been attained with the natives, is confined to their planting\nin some districts fifty to one hundred pepper-vines round their\nhuts, which they cultivate in the same way as they would plots of\nflowers, but without any other labor than supporting the plant with\na proportioned stake, clearing the ground from weeds, and attending\nto daily irrigation.",
        "[A possibility.] This article therefore scarcely deserves a place\namongst the flourishing branches of agriculture, at least till it has\nbeen raised from its present depressed state, and the grounds laid\nout in regular and productive pepper-groves. Till this is done, to\na corresponding extent, it must also be excluded from the number of\nproductions furnished by these Islands to commerce and exportation;\nmore particularly if we consider that, notwithstanding the great\nfragrance of the grain, as well as its general superiority over the\nrest of Asia, so great a difference exists in the actual price, that\nthis can never be compensated by its greater request in the markets of\nEurope, and much less enable it to compete with that of the British and\nDutch, till its abundance has considerably lowered its primitive value.",
        "[Not popular.] Finally, although an infinity of grounds are to be found\nadapted to the rapid propagation of pepper-vines, as may easily be\ninferred from the analogy and proximity of the Philippine Islands to\nthe others of this same archipelago, so well known for their growth\nof spices, it must be confessed that it is a species of culture by\nno means popular among the Philippine natives, and it would be almost\nrequiring too much from their inconstancy of character, to wish them\nto dedicate their lands and time to the raising of a production which,\nbesides demanding considerable care, is greatly exposed to injury,\nand even liable to be destroyed by the severity of the storms, which\nfrequently mark the seasons. With difficulty would they be induced to\nwait five years before they were able to gather the uncertain fruits\nof their labor and patience. If, therefore, it should ever be deemed\na measure of policy to encourage the growth of black pepper, it will\nbe necessary for the government to order the commons belonging to each\ntown, and adapted to this species of plantation, to be appropriated to\nthis use, by imposing on the inhabitants the obligation of taking care\nof them, and drawing from the respective coffers of each community the\nnecessary funds for the payment of the laborers, and the other expenses\nof cultivation. If this cannot be done, it will be necessary to wait\ntill the general condition of the country is improved, when through\nthe spirit of emulation, and the enterprises of the planters being duly\npatronized and supported, present difficulties may be overcome, and the\nprogressive results of future attempts will be then found to combine\nthe interests of individuals with the general welfare of the colony.",
        "[Coffee.] So choice is the quality of the coffee produced in the\nIsland of Luzon, especially in the districts of Indang and Silang,\nin the province of Cavite, that if it is not equal to that of Mocha,\nI at least consider it on parallel with the coffee of Bourbon; but,\nas the consumption and cultivation are extremely limited, it cannot\nwith any propriety be yet numbered among the articles contributing\nto the export-trade.",
        "[Cocoa.] Cocoa is something more attended to, in consequence of the\nuse of chocolate being greatly extended among the natives of easy\ncircumstances. That of the Island of Cebu, is esteemed superior to\nthe cocoa of Guayaquil, and possibly it is not excelled by that of\nSoconusco. As, however, the quantity raised does not suffice for\nthe local consumption, Guayaquil cocoa meets a ready sale, and is\ngenerally brought in return-cargo by the ships coming from Acapulco,\nand those belonging to the Philippine company dispatched from Callao,\nthe shipping port of Lima.",
        "The cultivation of these two articles in the Philippines is on the\nsame footing as that of pepper, which, as above stated, is rather an\nobject of luxury and recreation than one of speculation among the\nFilipinos. The observations and rules pointed out in the preceding\narticle, are, in a general sense, applicable to both these branches\nof industry.",
        "[Cinnamon.] Cinnamon groves, or trees of wild cinnamon, are to be\nfound in every province. In Mindanao, a Dutchman, some years ago,\nwas employed by orders of the government, in examining the forests\nand making experiments, with a view to discover the same tree of\nthis species that has given so much renown to Ceylon; but, whether\nit was owing to a failure in the discovery, or, when the plant was\nfound, as at the time was said to be the case, the same results were\nnot produced, from the want of skill in preparing, or stripping off\nthe bark; certain it is, that the laudable attempt totally failed,\nor rather the only advantage gained, has been the extracting from\nthe bark and more tender parts of the branches of the tree, an oil\nor essence of cinnamon, vigorous and aromatic in the extreme.",
        "[Experiment in Laguna.] About the same time, a land-owner of the name\nSalgado, undertook to form an extensive plantation of the same species\nin the province of La Laguna, and succeeded in seeing upwards of a\nmillion cinnamon trees thrive and grow to a considerable size; but\nat last, he was reluctantly compelled to desist from his enterprise,\nby the same reasons which led to the failure of Mindanao.",
        "[Need of experienced cultivators.] These facts are of sufficient\nauthority for our placing the cinnamon tree among the indigenous\nproductions of the Philippine Islands and considering their general\nexcellence above those of the same nature in the rest of Asia, it may\nreasonably be concluded that, without the tree being identically the\nsame, the cinnamon with which it is clothed will be found finer than\nthat yielded by the native plant of the Island of Ceylon, and this\ncircumstance, consequently, holds out a hope that, in the course of\ntime, it may become an article of traffic, as estimable as it would be\nnew. In order, however, that this flattering prospect may be realized,\nit will be requisite for the government to procure some families,\nor persons from the above island, acquainted with the process of\nstripping off the bark and preparing the cinnamon, by dexterously\noffering allurements, corresponding to the importance of the service,\nwhich, although in itself it may probably be an extremely simple\noperation, as long as it is unknown, will be an insuperable obstacle\nto the propagation of so important an agricultural pursuit.",
        "[Nutmeg.] Two species of nutmeg are known here, the one in shape\nresembling a pigeon’s egg, and the other of a perfectly spherical\nform; but both are wild and little aromatic, and consequently held\nin no great esteem.",
        "[Rice.] Rice is the bread and principal aliment of these natives, for\nwhich reason, although its cultivation is among the most disagreeable\ndepartments of husbandry, they devote themselves to it with astonishing\nconstancy and alacrity, so as to form a complete contrast with their\ncharacteristic indifference in most other respects. This must, however,\nbe taken as a certain indication of the possibility of training them\nup to useful labor; whenever they can be led on in a proper manner.",
        "[High yield.] The earth corresponds with surprising fertility to\nthe labors of the Filipino, rewarding him, in the good seasons, with\nninety, and even as high as one hundred per cent; a fact I have fully\nascertained and of which I besides possess undoubted proofs, obtained\nfrom the parish-curates of La Pampanga. As, however, the provinces are\nfrequently visited with dreadful hurricanes (called in the country,\nbaguios), desolated by locusts, and exposed to the effects of the\ngreat irregularities of nature, which, in these climes, often acts\nin extreme, the crops of this grain are precarious, or at least,\nno reliance can be placed on a certain surplus allowing an annual\nexportation to China. On this account, rice cannot be placed in the\nlist of those articles which give support to the external trade.",
        "[Dye and cabinet woods.] The “sibucao,” or logwood, and ebony, in\nboth which these islands abound, are the only woods in any tolerable\nrequest. The first is sold with advantage in Bengal, and the other\nmeets a ready sale in the ports of China, in the absence of that\nbrought from the Island of Bourbon, which is a quality infinitely\nsuperior. Both are however, articles of no great consumption, for,\nbeing bulky and possessing little intrinsic value, they will not\nbear the high charges of freight and other expenses, attendant on\nthe navigation of the Asiatic seas, and can only suit the shipper,\nas cargo, who is anxious not to return to the above countries in\nballast. Hence, as an object of export trade, these articles cannot\nbe estimated at more than $30,000 per annum.",
        "[Timber.] I deem it superfluous to dwell on a multitude of other\ngood and even precious woods in timber, with which the Philippine\nIslands are gifted, because this is a subject already suficiently well\nunderstood, and a complete collection of specimens, as well as some\nlarge blocks, were besides transmitted some years ago to the king’s\ndockyard. It may, however, be proper to remark, that the establishment\nnear the capital for shipbuilding and masts, are much more expensive\nthan is generally supposed, as well on account of the difficulties\nexperienced in dragging the trees from the interior of the mountains\nto the water’s edge, as the want of regularity and foresight with\nwhich these operations have been usually conducted. Besides these\nreasons, as it is necessary that the other materials requisite for\nthe construction and complete armament of vessels of a certain\nforce, should come from Europe, it is neither easy, nor indeed,\nwould it be economical, as was erroneously asserted, to carry into\neffect the government project of annually building, in the colony,\na ship of the line and a frigate. It ought further to be observed,\nthat no stock of timber, cut at a proper season and well cured, has\nbeen lain in, and although the wages of the native carpenters and\ncaulkers are moderate, no comparison whatever can be made between the\ndaily work they perform, and that which is done in the same space of\ntime in our dock-yards of Spain.",
        "[Ship building advantages.] Notwithstanding, however, the impediments\nabove stated, as it is undeniable that abundance of suitable timber is\nto be obtained, and as the conveyance of the remainder of the necessary\nnaval stores to the Philippine Islands is shorter and more economical\nthan to the coast of California, it possibly might answer, at least,\nmany mariners are of this opinion, in case it is deemed expedient to\ncontinue building at San Blas the brigs and corvettes necessary for the\nprotection of the military posts and missions, situated along the above\ncoasts, to order them preferably to be built in Cavite giving timely\nadvice, and previously taking care to make the necessary arrangements.",
        "[Gold.] Gold abounds in Luzon and in many of the other islands; but as\nthe mountains which conceal it are in possession of the pagan tribes,\nthe mines are not worked; indeed it may be said they are scarcely\nknown. These mountaineers collect it in the brooks and streamlets,\nand in the form of dust, offer it to the Christians who inhabit the\nneighboring plains, in exchange for coarse goods and fire-arms; and it\nhas sometimes happened that they have brought it down in grains of one\nand two ounces weight. The natives of the province of Camarines partly\ndevote themselves to the working of the mines of Mambulao and Paracale,\nwhich have the reputation of being very rich; but, far from availing\nthemselves in the smallest degree of the advantages of art, they\ncontent themselves with extracting the ore by means of an extremley\nimperfect fusion, which is done by placing the mineral in shells and\nthen heating them on embers. A considerable waste consequently takes\nplace, and although the metal obtained is good and high colored,\nit generally, passes into the hands of the district-magistrate, who\ncollects it at a price infinitely lower than it is worth in trade. It\nis a generally received opinion that gold mines are equally to be\nmet with in the Province of Caraga, situated on the coasts of the\ngreat Island of Mindanao, where, as well as in other points, this\nmetal is met with equal to twenty-two karats. The quantity, however,\nhitherto brought down from the mountains by the pagan tribes, and\nthat obtained by the tributary Filipinos, has not been an object of\nvery great importance.",
        "[Copper.] Well-founded reasons exist for presuming that, in\nthe Province of Ilocos, mines of virgin copper exist, a singular\nproduction of nature, or at least, not very common, if the generality\nof combinations under which this metal presents itself in the\nrest of the globe, are duly considered. This is partly inferred\nfrom the circumstance of its having been noticed that the Igorots,\nwho occasionally come down from the mountains to barter with the\nChristians, use certain coarse jars or vessels of copper, evidently\nmade by themselves with the use of a hammer, without any art or\nregularity; and as the ignorance of these demi-savages is too great\nfor them to possess the notions necessary for the separation of the\ncomponent parts which enter into the combination of minerals, and much\nless for the construction of furnaces suitable to the smelting and\nformation of the moulds, it is concluded they must have found some\nvein of copper entirely pure, which, without the necessity of any\nother preparation, they have been able to flatten with the hammer and\nrendered maleable, so as to convert it into the rough vessels above\nspoken of.",
        "[Cinnabar.] The district-magistrate of Caraga, Don Augustin de Ioldi,\nreceived a special commission from the government to explore and\nobtain information respecting a mine of cinnabar, which was said\nto be situated under his jurisdiction; and I have been informed of\nanother of the same species in the Island of Samar, the working of\nwhich has ceased for a considerable time, not because the prospect was\nunfavorable, but for the want of an intelligent person to superintend\nand carry on the operations. The utility of such a discovery is too\nobvious not to deserve, on the part of government, the most serious\nattention and every encouragement to render it available; and it is\nto be hoped that, as the first steps have already been taken in this\nimportant disclosure, the enterprise will not be abandoned, but, on\nthe contrary, that exertions will be made to obtain aid and advice\nfrom the Miners’ College of Mexico, as the best means of removing\ndoubt, and acting with judgment in the affair.",
        "[Iron.] Iron in mineral form is to be found at various points on Luzon,\nand those engaged in working it, without the necessity of digging;\ncollect the iron-bearing stones that constitute the upper stratum,\nthese, when placed in fusion, generally yield about forty per cent\nclear metal. This is the case in the mountains of Angat, situated\nin the Province of Bulacan, and also in the vicinity of the Baliwag\nRiver. In Morong, however, belonging to the Province of La Laguna,\nwhere the cannon-ball factory is established, the ore yields under\ntwenty-two per cent. Its quality is in general better than the Biscayan\niron, according to formal experiments and a report, made in 1798 to\nGovernor Don Rafael Maria de Aguilar, by two Biscayan master-smiths\nfrom the squadron of Admiral Alava. Witnesses to this test were the\nCount de Aviles and Don Felix de la Rosa, proprietors of the mines of\nMorong and Angat, and the factor of the Philippine Company, Don Juan\nFrancisco Urroroz. Notwithstanding its advantages, this interesting\nbranch of industry has not yet passed beyond the most rude principles\nand imperfect practice, owing to the want of correct information\nas to the best process, and scarcity of funds on the part of the\nproprietors to carry on their works. Without the aid of rolling or\nslitting mills, indeed unprovided with the most essential instruments,\nthey have hitherto confined themselves to converting their iron into\nplow shares, bolos, hoes, and such other agricultural implements;\nleaving the Chinese of Amoy in quiet possession of the advantages\nof being allowed to market annual supplies of all kinds of nails,\nthe boilers used on the sugar plantations, pots and pans, as well as\nother articles in this line, which might easily be manufactured in\nthe Islands.",
        "[Sulphur.] In the Island of Leyte, abundance of sulphur is met with,\nand from thence the gunpowder works of Manila are supplied at very\nreasonable prices. Jaspers, cornelians and agates, are also found in\nprofusion in many of these provinces; everything, indeed, promises\nvaried mineral wealth worthy of exciting the curiosity and useful\nresearches of mineralogists, who, unfortunately, have not hitherto\nextended their labors to these remote parts of the globe.",
        "[Pearls.] Pearl fisheries are, from time to time, undertaken off the\ncoast of the Island of Mindanao, and also near smaller islands not\nfar from Cebu, but with little success and less constancy, not because\nthere is a scarcity of fine pearls of a bright color and considerable\nsize, but on account of the divers’ want of skill and their just dread\nof the sharks, which, in great numbers infest these seas. Amber is\nfrequently gathered in considerable lumps in the vicinity of Samar and\nthe other Visayan Islands as well as mother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell,\nand red and black coral, of the latter kind of which, I have seen\nshafts as thick as my finger and six or eight feet long.",
        "[Estates.] The proprietors of estates in the Philippines are of\nfour classes. The most considerable is that of the religious orders,\nAugustinians and Dominicans, who cultivate their respective lands on\njoint account, or let them out at a moderate ground-rent, which the\nplanters pay in kind; but far from living in opulence, and accumulating\nthe immense revenues some of the religious communities enjoy in\nAmerica, they stand in need of all they earn and possess for their\nmaintenance, and in order to be enabled to discharge the various duties\nand obligations annexed to the missions with which they are entrusted.",
        "[Spanish planters.] The second class comprehends the Spanish\nproprietors, whose number possibly does not exceed a dozen of persons,\nand even they labor under such disadvantages, and have to contend with\nso many obstacles, under the existing order of things, that, compelled\nto divide their lands into rice plantations, in consequence of this\nbeing the species of culture to which the natives are most inclined,\nand to devote a considerable portion of them to the grazing of horned\ncattle, no one of them is in a situation to give to agriculture the\nvariety and extent desired, or to attain any progress in a pursuit\nwhich in other colonies rapidly leads to riches.",
        "[Filipino farmers.] The third consists of the principal mestizos\nand natives, and is in fact that which constitutes the real body of\nfarming proprietors. In the fourth and last may be included all the\nother natives, who generally possess a small strip of land situated\nround their dwellings, or at the extremities of the various towns\nand settlements formed by the conquerors; besides what they may\nhave obtained from their ancestors in the way of legal inheritance,\nwhich rights have been confirmed to them by the present sovereign of\nthe colony.",
        "[Aids to agriculture.] It will beyond doubt, in some measure dissipate\nthe distrust by which the Filipino is actuated, when the new and\npaternal exertions of the superior government, to ameliorate his\npresent situation, are fully known, and when that valuable portion of\nour distant population is assured that their rights will henceforth be\nrespected, and those exactions and compulsory levies which formerly\nso much disheartened them, are totally abolished. On the other\nhand, a new stimulus will be given by the living example and fresh\nimpulse communicated to the provinces by other families emigrating\nand settling there, nurtured in the spirit and principles of those\nreforms in the ideas and maxims of government by which the present\nera is distinguished. A practical participation in these advantages\nwill, most assuredly, awaken a spirit of enterprise and emulation\nthat may be extremely beneficial to agriculture, and as the wants\nof the natives increase in proportion as they are enabled to know\nand compare the comforts arising out of the presence and extension\nof conveniences and luxuries in their own towns, they will naturally\nbe led to possess and adopt them.",
        "[Plans for progress.] So salutary a change, however, can only be\nthe work of time, and as long as the government confines itself\nto a system merely protecting, the effects must consequently be\nslow. As it is therefore necessary to put in action more powerful\nsprings than the ordinary ones, it will be found expedient partly to\nrelax from some of those general principles which apply to societies,\ndifferently constituted, or rather formed of other perfectly distinct\nelements. As relating to the subject under discussion, I fortunately\ndiscover two means, pointed out in the laws themselves, essentially\njust, and at the same time capable of producing in this populous\ncolony, more than in any other, the desired results. The legislator,\nfounding himself on the common obligation of the subject to contribute\nsomething in return for the protection he receives, and to co-operate\nin the increase of the power and opulence of the State, proscribes\nidleness as a crime, and points out labor as a duty; and although\nthe regulations touching the natives breathe the spirit of humanity,\nand exhibit the wisdom with which they were originally formed, they\nnevertheless concur and are directed to this primary object. In them\nthe distribution of vacant lands, as well as of the natives at fair\ndaily wages to clear them, is universally allowed, and these it seems\nto me, are the means from an equitable and intelligent application\nof which the most beneficial consequences may be expected.",
        "[Confiscating unused lands.] The first cannot be attended with any\ngreat difficulty, because all the provinces abound in waste and vacant\nlands, and scarcely is there a district in which some are not to be\nfound of private property completely uncultivated and neglected,\nand consequently susceptible, as above stated, of being legally\ntransferred, for this reason alone, to the possession of an active\nowner. Let their nature however, be what it may, in their adjudication,\nit is of the greatest importance to proceed with uniformity, by\nconsecrating, in a most irrevocable manner, the solemnity of all\nsimilar grants. Public interest and reason, in the Philippine Islands,\nrequire that in all such cases deference only should be paid to\ndemands justly interposed, and formally established within a due and\nfixed period; but after full and public notice has been given by the\nrespective judicial authorities, of the titles about to be granted,\nthe counter claims the natives may seek to put in after the lapse of\nthe period prefixed, should be peremptorily disregarded. Although at\nfirst sight this appears a direct infringement on the imprescriptible\nrights of property, it must be considered that in some cases individual\ninterests ought to be sacrifced to the general good, and that the\nbalance used, when treating of the affairs of State, is never of\nthat rigid kind as if applied to those of minor consideration. The\nfact is, that by this means many would be induced to form estates,\nwho have hitherto been withheld by the dread of involving themselves,\nand spending their money in law suits; at the same time the natives,\ngradually accustoming themselves to this new order of things, would\nlay aside that disposition to strife and contention, which forms so\npeculiar a trait in their character, and that antipathy and odium would\nalso disappear with which they have usually viewed the agricultural\nundertakings of Spaniards.",
        "[Compulsory labor.] Proceeding to the consideration of the second\nmeans of accelerating the improvement of agriculture, viz., the\ndistribution of the natives, it will suffice to say that it would be\nequally easy to show that it is absolutely necessary rigorously to\ncarry into effect, in the Philippine Islands, whatever the laws on this\nsubject prescribed, otherwise we must give up all those substantial\nhopes entertained of the felicity of the colony. We are no longer in\na situation to be restricted to the removal of ordinary obstacles,\nand the season is gone by in which, as heretofore, it entered into\nour policy to employ no other than indirect stimulants–in order to\nincline the Filipino to labor. It is evident that admonitions and\noffers of reward no longer suffice; nor indeed have the advantageous\nterms proposed to them by some planters, with a view to withdraw\nthe lower orders of the natives, such as the timauas and caglianes\nplebeians, from the idle indifference in which they are sunk, been of\nany avail. Their wants and wishes being easily supplied, the whole\nof their happiness seems to depend on quiet and repose, and their\nhighest enjoyment on the pleasure of sleep. Energy, however, and a\ncertain degree of severity must be employed, if permanent resources\nare to be called forth, and if the progressive settlement of European\nfamilies and the formation of estates proportioned to the fertility\nof the soil and capabilities of the country are to enter into the\nviews of government. In vain would grants and transfers of vacant and\nuseless lands be made to new and enterprising proprietors, unless at\nthe same time they can be provided with laborers, and experience every\nother possible facility, in order to clear, enclose, and cultivate\nthem. Hence follows the indispensable necessity of appealing to the\nsystem of distributions, as above pointed out; for what class of\nlaborers can be obtained in a country where the whites are so few,\nunless it be the natives? Should they object to personal service,\nshould they refuse to labor for an equitable and daily allowance,\nby which means they would also cease to be burdens to the State\nand to society, are they not to be compelled to contribute by this\nmeans to the prosperity of which they are members; in a word, to\nthe public good, and thus make some provision for old age? If the\nsoldier, conveyed away from his native land, submits to dangers, and\nis unceasingly exposed to death in defence of the State, why should\nnot the Filipino moderately use his strength and activity in tilling\nthe fields which are to sustain him and enrich the commonwealth?",
        "[The undeveloped Philippines.] Besides, things in the Philippine\nIslands wear a very different aspect to what they do on the American\ncontinent, where, as authorized by the said laws, a certain number\nof natives may be impressed for a season, and sent off inland to a\nconsiderable distance from their dwellings, either for the purpose of\nagriculture, or working the mines, provided only they are taken care of\nduring their journeys, maintained, and the price of their daily labor,\nas fixed by the civil authorities, regularly paid to them. The immense\nvalleys and mountains susceptible of cultivation, especially in the\nIsland of Luzon, being once settled, and the facilities of obtaining\nhands increased, such legal acts of compulsion, far from being any\nlonger necessary, will have introduced a spirit of industry that\nwill render the labors of the field supportable and even desirable;\nand in this occupation all the tributary natives of the surrounding\nsettlements can be alternately employed, by the day or week, and thus\ndo their work almost at the door of their own huts, and as it were\nin sight of their wives and children.",
        "[No legal obstacle to forced labor.] If, after what has been above\nstated, the apparent opposition obstacle to which at first sight\nstrikes the eye, in Law 40, Title 12, Book 6, speaking on this subject,\nand expressly referring to the Philippine Islands, should be alleged,\nno more will be necessary than to study its genuine sense, or read it\nwith attention, in order to be convinced of its perfect concordance\nwith the essential parts of the other laws of the Indies, already\nquoted in explanation and support of the system of distributing\nthe laborers. The above-mentioned law does indeed contain a strict\nrecommendation to employ the Chinese and Japanese, not domiciliated,\nin preference to the natives, in the establishments for cutting timber\nand other royal works, and further enjoins that use is only to be made\nin emergencies, and when the preservation of the state should require\nit. It has, however, happened that, since the remote period at which\nthe above was promulgated, not only all contracts and commerce have\nceased, but also every communication with Japan has been interrupted,\nand for a number of years not a single individual of that ferocious\nrace has existed in the Philippine Islands. With regard to the Chinese,\nwho are supposed to be numerous in the capital, of late years they have\ndiminished so much, that according to a census made by orders of the\ngovernment in the year 1807, no more than four thousand seven hundred\nare found on the registers; and, if in consequence of their secreting\nthemselves, or withdrawing into the interior, a third more might be\nadded to the above amount, their total numbers would still remain\nvery inconsiderable, and infinitely inferior to what is required,\nnot only for the tillage of the estates, but even for the royal works.",
        "[Substitute laborers wanting.] As, therefore, the Japanese have totally\ndisappeared, and the number of Chinese is evidently inadequate to the\nwants of agriculture, it almost necessarily follows that the practice\nof distributing the Filipino laborers, as allowed by the aforesaid\nlaws of the Indies, under all circumstances, is the only alternate\nleft. Even if, against the adoption of this measure, it should be\nattempted to urge the ambiguous sense of the concluding part of the\nsecond clause, it would be easy to comprehend its true intent and\nmeaning, by referring to Law 1, Title 13, Book 5, which says:",
        "“That, considering the inconveniences which would arise from doing\naway with certain distributions of grounds, gardens, estates, and\nother plantations, in which the Indians are interested, as a matter\non which the preservation of those distant dominions and provinces\ndepends, it is ordained that compulsory labor, and such distributions\nas are advantageous to the public good, shall continue.”",
        "After so pointed an explanation, and a manifestation so clear of\nthe spirit of our legislation in this respect, all further comments\nwould be useless, and no doubt whatever can be any longer entertained\nof the expediency, and even of the justice of putting the plan of\nwell-regulated distributions in practice, as a powerful means to\npromote the agriculture, and secure to Spain the possession of these\nvaluable dominions of the Indian Seas. ....",
        "[Manufactures.] .... It would be impossible to gainsay Don Juan\nFrancisco Urroz, of the Philippine Company, in his detailed and\naccurate report to the managing committee in 1802, when he observes:",
        "“That the Philippine Islands, from time immemorial, were acquainted\nwith, and still retain, that species of industry peculiar to the\ncountry, adapted to the customs and wants of the natives, and which\nconstitutes the chief branch of their clothing. This, although\nconfined to coarse articles, may in its class be called perfect, as\nfar as it answers the end for which it is intended; and if an attempt\nwere made to enumerate the quantity of mats, handkerchiefs, sheeting,\nand a variety of other cloths manufactured for this purpose only in\nthe Provinces of Tondo, Laguna, Batangas, Ilocos, Cagayan, Camarines,\nAlbay, Visaya, etc., immense supplies of each kind would appear, which\ngive occupation to an incalculable number of looms, indistinctly worked\nby Indians, Chinese, and Sangleyan mestizos, indeed all the classes,\nin their own humble dwellings, built of canes and thatched with palm\nleaves, without any apparatus of regular manufacture.”",
        "[Native cloth weaving.] With equal truth am I enabled to add, that the\nnatural abilities of these natives in the manufacture of all kinds of\ncloths, fine as well as coarse, are really admirable. They succeed\nin reducing the harsh filaments of the palm-tree, known by the name\nof abaca, to such a degree of fineness, that they afterwards convert\nthem into textures equal to the best muslins of Bengal. The beauty\nand evenness of their embroideries and open work excite surprise;\nin short, the damask table-cloths, ornamental weaving, textures of\ncotton and palm-fibres, intermixed with silk, and manufactured in the\nabove-mentioned provinces, clearly prove how much the inhabitants of\nthe Philippine Islands, in natural abilities and dexterity, resemble\nthe other people of the Asiatic regions. It must nevertheless be\nallowed, that a want is noticed of that finish and polish which the\nperfection of art gives to each commodity; but this circumstance\nought not to appear strange, if we consider that, entirely devoid of\nall methodical instruction, and ignorant also of the importance of\nthe subdivision of labor, which contributes so greatly to simplify,\nshorten, and improve the respective excellence of all kinds of works,\nthe same natives gin and clean the cotton, and then spin and weave it,\nwithout any other instruments than their hands and feet, aided only by\nthe course and unsightly looms they themselves construct in a corner\nof their huts, with scarcely anything else than a few canes and sticks.",
        "[Aptitude for, but no development of, manufacturing.] From the\npreceding observations it may easily be deduced that, although\nthe natives succeed in preparing, with admirable dexterity, the\nproductions of their soil, and therewith satisfy the greatest part of\ntheir domestic wants, facts which certainly manifest their talents\nand aptitude to be employed in works of more taste and delicacy,\nmanufacturing industry is nevertheless far from being generalized,\nnor can it be said to be placed with any degree of solidity on its\ntrue and proper basis. Hence arise those great supplies of goods\nannually imported into the country, for the purpose of making up the\ndeficiencies of the local manufactures.",
        "[Improved methods and machinery needed.] The regular distribution or\nclassification of the assemblage of operations which follow each other\nin graduation, from the rough preparation of the first materials, till\nthe same have arrived at their perfect state of manufacture, instead\nof being practiced, is entirely unknown. The want of good machinery\nto free the cotton from the multitude of seeds with which it is\nencumbered, so as to perform the operation with ease and quickness, is\nthe first and greatest obstacle that occurs; and its tediousness to the\nnatives is so repugnant, that many sell their crops to others, without\nseparating the seeds, or decline growing the article altogether, not\nto be plagued with the trouble of cleaning it. As the want of method\nis also equal to the superabundance or waste of time employed, the\nexpenses of the goods manufactured increased in the same proportion,\nunder such evident and great disadvantages; for which reason, far from\nbeing able to compete with those brought from China and British India,\nthey only acquire estimation in the interior, when wanted to supply\nthe place of the latter, or in cases of accidental scarcity.",
        "[Scanty exports.] In a word, the only manufactured articles annually\nexported from the Philippine Islands are eight to twelve thousand\npieces exports of light sail cloth, two hundred thousand pounds of\nabaca cordage assorted, and six hundred carabao hides and deer skins,\nwhich can scarcely be considered in a tanned state/ for, although the\nRoyal Company, from the time of their establishment, long continued to\nexport considerable quantities of dimities, calicos, stripes, checks,\nand coverlids, as well as other cotton and silk goods, it was more\nwith a view to stimulate the districts of Ilocos to continue in the\nhabit of manufacturing, and thus introduce among the inhabitants of\nthat province a taste for industry, than the expectation of gain by\nthe sale of this kind of merchandise either in Spain or any of the\nsections of America. At length, wearied with the losses experienced by\ncarrying on this species of mercantile operations, without answering\nthe principal object in view, they resolved, for the time being,\nto suspend ventures attended with such discouraging circumstances.",
        "[Need of encouragement.] Notwithstanding so many impediments, it\nwould not, however, be prudent in the government entirely to abandon\nthe enterprise, and lose sight of the advantages the country offers,\nor indeed, to neglect turning the habitual facilities of the natives\nto some account. Far from there existing any positive grounds for\ndespairing of the progress of manufacturing industry, it may justly\nbe presumed that, whenever the sovereign, by adopting a different line\nof policy, shall allow the unlimited and indistinct settlement of all\nkinds of foreign colonists, and grant them the same facilities and\nprotection enjoyed by national ones, they will be induced to flock to\nthe Philippine Islands in considerable numbers, lured by the hope of\naccumulating fortunes in a country that presents a thousand attractions\nof every kind. Many, no doubt, will preferably devote themselves\nto commerce, others to agricultural undertakings and also to the\npursuits of mining, but necessarily some will turn their attention\nand employ their funds in the formation of extensive manufactures,\naided by intelligent instructors and suitable machinery. The\nnewly-introduced information and arts being thus diffused, it is\nnatural to expect they will be progressively adopted by a people\nalready possessing a taste and genius for this species of labor,\nby which means manufacturing industry will soon be raised from the\nstate of neglect and unprofitableness in which it is now left.",
        "[Internal commerce handicapped.] The circulation of the country\nproductions and effects of all kinds among the inhabitants of the\nprovinces, which, properly speaking, constitutes their internal\ncommerce, is tolerably active and considerable. Owing to the great\nfacilities of conveyance afforded by the number of rivers and lakes, on\nthe margins of which the Filipinos are fond of fixing their dwellings,\nthis commerce might be infinitely greater, if it was not obstructed\nby the monopoly of the magistrates in their respective districts\nand the unjust prerogative, exercised by the city, of imposing\nrates and arbitrary prices on the very persons who come to bring the\nsupplies. Nevertheless, as the iniquituous operations of the district\nmagistrates, however, active they may be, besides being restricted\nby their financial ability, regularly consist of arrangements to buy\nup only the chief articles, and those which promise most advantage,\nwith least trouble; as that restless inquietude which impels man on,\nunder the hope of bettering his condition, acts even amidst rigor of\noppression, a certain degree of stimulus and scope is still left in\nfavor of internal trade.",
        "[Inter-island traffic.] Hence it follows, that there is scarcely an\nisland or province, that does not carry on some traffic or other,\nby keeping up relations with its neighbors, which sometimes extend\nas far as the capital; where, in proportion as the produce and raw\nmaterials find a ready market, returns suitable and adequate to the\nconsumption of each place, respectively, are obtained. If, however, it\nwould be difficult to form an idea, even in the way of approximation,\nof the exchanges which take place between the various provinces,\na task that would render it necessary to enumerate them, one by one,\nit is equally so to make an estimate of the total amount of this class\nof operation carried on in Manila, their common center. Situated in\nthe bottom of an inmense bay, bathed by a large river, and the country\nround divided by an infinite number of streams and lakes descending\nfrom the provinces by which the capital is surrounded, the produce and\neffects are daily brought in and go out of suburbs so extended in a\ndiversity of small vessels and canoes, without its being possible to\nobtain any exact account of the multiplicity of transactions carried\non at one and the same time, in a city built on so large a scale.",
        "[Local markets.] Besides the traffic founded on ordinary consumption,\nthe necessity of obtaining assortments of home-manufactured as well\nas imported goods, in order to supply the markets, known by the name\nof tianguis, and which are held weekly in almost every town, there\nis another species of speculation, peculiar to the rich natives\nand Sangley mestizos, an industrious race, and also possessed of\nthe largest portion of the specie. This consists in the anticipated\npurchase of the crops of indigo, sugar, rice, etc., with a view to fix\ntheir own prices on the produce thus contracted for, when resold to the\nsecond hand. A propensity to barter and traffic, in all kinds of ways,\nis indeed universal among the natives, and as the principal springs\nwhich urge on internal circulation are already in motion, nothing\nmore is wanting than at once to destroy the obstacles previously\npointed out, and encourage the extension of luxury and comforts,\nin order that, by the number of the people’s wants being increased,\nas well as the means of supplying them, the force and velocity of\naction may in the same proportion be augmented.",
        "[External commerce.] Under “External Commerce” generally are comprised\nthe relations the Philippine Islands keep up with other nations, with\nthe Spanish possessions in America, and with the mother country; or,\nin other words, the sum total of their imports and exports.",
        "[Outside deterrents.] Many are the causes which, within the last\nten or twelve years, have influenced the mercantile relations of\nthese Islands, and prevented their organization on permanent and\nknown principles. The chief one, no doubt, has been the frequent and\nunforeseen changes, from peace to war, which have marked that unhappy\nperiod, and as under similar circumstances merchants, more than\nany other class of persons, are in the habit of acting on extremes,\nthere have been occasions in which, misled by the exaggerated idea\nof the galleon of Acapulco, and anxious to avail themselves of the\nfirst prices, generally also the highest, foreign speculators have\ninundated Manila with goods, by a competition from all quarters; and\nothers, owing to the channels being obstructed, when this market has\nexperienced an absolute scarcity of commodities, as well as of funds\nnecessary to continue the usual and almost only branch of commerce\nleft. The frequent failure of the sugar and indigo crops, has also\nin many instances restrained the North Americans and other neutrals\nfrom coming to these Islands with cargoes, and induced them to prefer\nJava, where they are at all times sure of finding returns. Besides\nthe influence of these extraordinary causes on the uncertainty\nand irregularity of external commerce, no small share must also be\nattributed to the strangeness of the peculiar constitution of the\ncountry, or the principles on which its trade is established.",
        "[Domestic discouragements.] Scarcely will it be believed, in the\ngreater part of civilized Europe, that a Spanish colony exists between\nAsia and America, whose merchants are forbidden to avail themselves\nof their advantageous situation, and that, as a special favor only\nare they allowed to send their effects to Mexico, once a year, but\nunder the following restrictions. It is a necessary condition, that\nevery shipper shall be a member of the Board of Trade (Consulado),\nand therein entitled to a vote, which supposes a residence of some\nyears in the country, besides the possession of property of his own to\nthe amount of $8,000. He is compelled to join with the other members,\nin order to be enabled to ship his goods in bales of a determined\nform and dimensions, in one single vessel, arranged, fitted out,\nand commanded by officers of the royal navy, under the character of a\nwar ship. He has also to contribute his proportion of $20,000, which,\nin the shape of a present, are given to the commander, at the end of\nevery round voyage. He cannot in any way interfere in the choice or\nqualities of the vessel, notwithstanding his property is to be risked\nin her; and what completes the extravagance of the system, is, that\nbefore anything is done he must pay down twenty-five or forty per cent\nfor freight, according to circumstances, which money is distributed\namong certain canons of the church, aldermen, subalterns of the army,\nand widows of Spaniards, to whom a given number of tickets or certified\npermits to ship are granted, either as a compensation for the smallness\nof their pay, or in the way of a privilege; but on express conditions\nthat, although they themselves are not members of the Board of Trade,\nthey shall not be allowed to negotiate and transfer them to persons\nnot having that quality. In the custom house nothing being admitted\nunless the number of bales shipped are accompanied by corresponding\npermits, and as it besides frequently happens that there is a degree\nof competition between the parties seeking to try their fortune in\nthis way, the original holders of the permits very often hang back,\nin such a manner that I have seen $500 offered for the transfer of\na right to ship three bales, which scarcely contained goods to the\namount of $1,000. Such, nevertheless, is the truth, and such the\nexact description of the famous Acapulco ship, which has excited so\nmuch jealousy among the merchants of Seville and Cadiz, and given\nrise to such an infinite number of disputes and lawsuits.",
        "[Business irregularities.] So complete a deviation from the rules\nand maxims usually received in trade, could not fail to produce\nin the Philippine Islands, as in fact it has, effects equally\nextraordinary with regard to those who follow this pursuit. The\nmerchant of Manila is, in fact, entirely different from the one in\nCadiz or Amsterdam. Without any correspondents in the manufacturing\ncountries and consequently possessed of no suitable advices of the\nfavorable variations in the respective markets, without brokers and\neven without regular books he seems to carry on his profession on\nno one fixed principle, and to have acquired his routine of business\nfrom mere habit and vague custom. His contracts are made out on stamped\npaper, and his bills or promissory notes no other than long and diffuse\nwritings or bonds, of which the dates and amounts are kept more in\nthe shape of bundles than by any due entry on his books; and what at\nonce gives the most clear idea of this irregularity is the singular\nfact that, for the space of twenty-five and possibly fifty years,\nonly one bankrupt has presented the state of his affairs to the Board\nof Trade, in conformity to the regulations prescribed by the general\nStatutes of Bankruptcy, whereas, numbers of cases have occurred in\nwhich these merchants have wasted or secreted the property of others\nwith impunity. Hence have arisen those irregularities, subterfuges\nand disputes, in a word, the absence of all mercantile business\ncarried on in a scrupulously punctual and correct manner. Hence, also,\nhave followed that distrust and embarrassment with which commercial\noperations are attended, as well as the difficulty of calculating\ntheir fluctuations. On the other hand, as in order to send off an\nexpedition by the annual ship to Acapulco, the previous consent\nof the majority of the incorporated merchants is necessary, before\nthis point is decided, months are passed in intrigues and disputes,\nthe peremptory period arrives, and if the articles wanted are in the\nmarket, they are purchased up with precipitation and paid for with\nthe monies the shippers have been able to obtain at an interest from\nthe administrators of pious and charitable funds. In this manner,\ncompelled to act almost always without plan or concert, yet accustomed\nto gain in the market of Acapulco, notwithstanding so many impediments\nand the exorbitant premiums paid for the money lent, these merchants\nfollow the strange maxim of risking little or no property of their\nown; and unaware, or rather, disregarding the importance of economy\nin the expenses and regularity of their general method of living,\nit is not possible they can ever accumulate large fortunes, or form\nsolid and well-accredited houses.",
        "[Merchants discouraged.] Thus oppressed by a system, as unjust as it\nis absurd, and conducting their affairs in the way above described,\nit is not strange that these gentlemen, at the same time yielding to\nthe indolence consequent on the climate, should neglect or behold with\nindifference all the other secondary resources which the supplying\nthe wants of the country and the extensive scope and variety of its\nproduce offer to the man of active mind. Hence it follows, as already\nobserved, that the whole of the interior trade is at present absorbed\nby the principal natives, the Sangley mestizos of both sexes, and a\nfew Chinese peddlers.",
        "[The outlook brightening.] Notwithstanding, however, the defective\nmanner in which the generality of the merchants act, some already\nare beginning to distinguish themselves by the prudence of their\nconduct, by forwarding, in time, their orders to the manufacturers\nof India and China, and, in other respects guiding themselves by the\nprinciples which characterize the intelligent merchant. Finally, it\nis to be presumed that, as soon as the government shall have thrown\ndown this singular and preposterous system that has been the cause of\nso many disorders, and proclaimed the unlimited freedom of Philippine\ncommerce, the greater part of these people will rise up from the state\nof inaction in which they now live, and the relations of the colony\nwill then assume the course and extent corresponding to its advantages\nof position. At least, if our national merchants should not act up\nto the impulse given to all kinds of mercantile enterprises by the\nbeneficial hand of the sovereign, foreigners will not be wanting, who,\nrelying on due toleration, will be induced to convey their fortunes\nand families to the Philippine Islands, and, vigorously encouraging\nthe exportation of their valuable productions, amply secure the fruits\nof their laudable activity and well-combined speculations.",
        "[Capital employed in commerce.] Were a person, judging from the\nnumbers constituting the body of registered merchants, and supposing\nall of them to possess the essential requisites prescribed by our\ncommercial regulations, to form a prudent estimate of the amount of\ncapital employed by them, his calculations would turn out extremely\nerroneous, for besides the case with which regulations of this kind\nare eluded, many are merely nominal traders, and there are others whose\nmercantile existence is purely artificial for they are sustained in a\ntemporary manner, by means of a forced species of circulation peculiar\nto this country. This consists in obtaining the acquiescence of the\nadministrators of pious and charitable funds, let out at interest,\nto renew the bonds they hold during other successive risks, waiting,\nas it were, till some fatal tempest has swallowed up the vessel in\nwhich these merchants suppose their property to be embarked, and\nat once cancel all their obligations. On the other hand, neither\nexcessive expenses nor the shipment of large quantities of goods to\nAcapulco can in any way be taken as a just criterion whereby to judge\nof the fortunes of individuals; because, in the first, there is great\nuniformity, every one, more or less, enjoying, exteriorly, the same\neasy circumstances, notwithstanding the disparity of real property;\nand in the second, considerable fiction prevails, many persons\nshipping under the same mark, and even when the shipper stands alone,\nhe might have been provided with the necessary funds from the pious\nand charitable establishments, possibly without risking a dollar\nof his own in the whole operation. Under circumstances so dubious,\nfar from presuming to give a decided opinion on the subject, I am\ncompelled to judge from mere conjectures, and guided only by the\nknowledge and experience I have been able to acquire during my long\nresidence there. In conformity thereto, I am inclined to believe,\nthat the total amount of capital belonging to and employed in the\ntrade of the Philippine Islands, does not at present exceed two\nand a half million dollars, with evident signs of rapid decline, if\nthe merchants do not in time abandon the ruinous systems of chiefly\ncarrying on their speculations with money obtained at interest.",
        "[Large sums hoarded.] The two and a half million dollars thus\nattributed to the merchants, form, however, the smaller part of the\nfunds distributed among the other classes, and the total amount of\nthe circulating medium of the colony might be considered an object\nsufficiently worthy of being ascertained, owing to the great light\nit would throw on the present state of the inhabitants; but it is in\nvain to attempt any calculation of the kind, at least without the aid\nof data possessing a certain degree of accuracy. The only thing that\ncan be affirmed is, that during the period of more than two hundred\nand fifty years which have elapsed since the conquest, the ingress of\nspecie into the Philippine Islands has been constant. Their annual\nships have seldom come from New Spain without bringing considerable\nsums in return, and if some of them have been lost, many others,\nwithout being confined to the one million of dollars constituting\nthe ordinary amount of the permit, have not unfrequently come back\nwith triple that sum; for which reason there are ample grounds of\njudging the estimates correct, which fix the total importation of\ndollars, during the whole of that long period of years, to be equal\nto four hundred millions. It may further be observed that, as in\nthe Sangley mestizos economy and avarice compete with intelligence\nand activity in accumulating wealth and as they are scattered, among\nthe principal islands, and in possession of the best lands and the\nmost lucrative business of the interior, there are ample motives for\npresuming that these industrious and sagacious people have gradually,\nalthough incessantly, amassed immense sums in specie; but it would\nbe impossible to point out their amount, distribution, or the secret\nplaces in which they are hoarded.",
        "[Pious and charitable funds’ capital.] The assemblage of pious\nlegacies, temporalities, and other funds and property placed under\nthe care of several administrative committees, for purposes as well\nreligious as charitable, constitute the chief capital employed in\nexternal trade; and notwithstanding the failures, which from time\nto time occur, the subsequent accumulation of the enormous premiums\nobtained for funds laid out in maritime speculations, both in time of\npeace and war, not only suffices to make up all losses of the above\nkind, but also to secure the punctual payment of such charitable\npensions and other charges as are to be deducted from the respective\nprofits of this species of stock, its total amount, according to an\nofficial report made by order of the head committee of the sinking\nfund, including temporalities, and Queen Maria of Austria’s endowment\nfor the College of Las Marianas, together with other funds of the same\nkind, not comprehended in the decree of abolition, at the commencement\nof the year 1809, amounted to $2,470,390, and as the sea-risks of that\nand the following year were successful, and the outstanding amounts\npunctually recovered, the aggregate sum, arising out of the above\ndescription of property, may now be estimated at more than three\nmillions. Of these funds three distributions are generally made,\nviz., one part is appropriated to the China risks, at from twelve\nto eighteen per cent. premium, according to circumstances, and also\nthose to Madras, Calcutta and Batavia, at from sixteen to twenty-two\nper cent. The second, which generally is in the largest proportion,\nis employed in risks to Acapulco, at various premiums, from 27 to 45\nper cent.; and the third is left in hand, as a kind of guarantee of\nthe stability of the original endowments.",
        "[Coveted by Spanish treasury.] In the great exigencies of the Royal\nTreasury, experienced during the last years of the administration\nof Sr. Soler, the royal decree of Consolidación was extended to the\nPhilippine Islands, under the pretext of guarding the funds belonging\nto public charities and religious endowments ... sea-risks, the\nincome of which, when secured on good mortgages, does not generally\nexceed five per cent, many in Spain not yielding above four; but the\nremarkable difference between this plan and the one above described,\ntogether with various and other weighty reasons alleged by the\nadministrators, caused the dreaded effect of this new regulation to\nbe suspended, and whilst the head committee of Manila were consulting\ntheir doubts and requesting fresh instructions from the court at home,\norders came out not to make any alteration in measures relating to\nthis description of property.",
        "[Easy capital but lessened profits.] Accustomed, in their limited\ncalculations, to identify the resources, offered by the funds belonging\nto this class of establishments, with the very existence of the\ncolony, the needy merchants easily confound their personal with the\ngeneral interest; and few stop to consider that the identical means\nof carrying on trade, without any capital of their own, although they\nhave accidentally enriched a small number of persons, eventually have\nabsorbed the principal profits, and possibly been the chief cause\nof the unflourishing state of the colony at large. Without fearing\nthe charge of rashness, it may, in fact, be asserted, that if these\ncharities and pious endowments had never existed, public prosperity\nin the Philippine Islands would, as in other parts, have been the\nimmediate effect of the united efforts of the individual members\nof the community and of the experience acquired in the constant\nprosecution of the same object. As, however, a progress of this kind,\nalthough certain, must necessarily have been at first extremely\nslow, and as, on the other hand, the preference given to mercantile\noperations undertaken with the funds belonging to public charities,\nhas its origin in the assemblage of vices so remarkable in the very\norganization of the body of Philippine merchants, any new measure on\nthis subject might be deemed inconsistent, that at once deprived them\nof the use of resources on which they had been accustomed to rely,\nwithout removing those other defects which excuse, if not encourage,\nthe continuation of the present system. Without, therefore, appealing\nto violent remedies, it is to be hoped that, in order to render plans\nof reform effectual, it will be sufficient, under more propitious\ncircumstances, to see property brought from other countries to these\nIslands, as well as persons coming to settle in them, capable of\nmanaging it with that intelligence and economy required by trade. The\ncompetition of those who speculate at random would then cease, or\nwhat is the same, as money obtained at a premium could not then be\nlaid out with the same advantages by the merchants as if it was their\nown, it will be necessary to renounce the fallacious profits held out\nby the public charities, till at least they are placed on a level\nwith existing circumstances, and brought in to be of real service\nto the honorable planter and laborious merchant, in their accidental\nexigencies, ceasing to be, as hitherto, the indirect cause of idleness,\ndissipation, and the ruin of an infinite number of families.",
        "[Mercantile shipping.] The vessels which the district magistrates of\nthe provinces employ in carrying on their trade with the capital and\nthose belonging to some of the richer merchants, together with such as\nare owned by the natives and mestizos, on an approximate calculation,\namount to twelve thousand tons, including ships, brigs, schooners,\ngalleys, barges, etc. For the want of better data, this estimate\nis founded only on reasonable conjecture, aided by the advice of\nexperienced persons, for although the greatest part of these vessels\nare built by the natives in the neighborhood of their own towns, no\nregister is kept of their number and dimensions, nor do they carry\nwith them the usual certificates. Those belonging to the merchants,\nthat is, ships and brigs of a certain size, have already begun to\nfrequent the ports of China, Java, the coast of Coromandel, Bengal,\nand the Isle of France, availing themselves of the lucrative freights\nwhich formerly enriched and encouraged foreign shipping. The other\nclass of vessels, although perfectly adequate to the coasting trade,\ncannot in general be applied to larger enterprises, on account of\ntheir not being sufficiently strong and capacious. The seamen are\nnot apprenticed, or as it is usually called, matriculated, but\ntheir frequent crossing from island to island, their familiarity\nwith regional tempests, voyages to various parts of America, and\nthe occupation of fishing followed by the inhabitants of the coast,\nserve to train up a large body of dexterous and able mariners who at\nall times can be had, without any compulsion, to complete the crews.",
        "[Need of nautical school.] The want of a public school for the\nteaching of navigation, is, however, sensibly felt, as well as great\ninconvenience from the scarcity of persons capable of being trusted\nwith the command of vessels, and the ignorance that prevails of the\nwaters of this dangerous Archipelago. Repeated royal orders have\nbeen sent over for the board of trade to proceed to the institution\nof so useful an establishment, and in the meantime, a medium has\nbeen resorted to in order to supply the deficiency, by allowing\nthe free admission of foreign mates, provided they exhibit proofs\nof their acquaintance with navigation, and profess the Catholic\nworship. Shipowners nevertheless experience great difficulties,\nparticularly at times when the Acapulco ship is fitting out, for\nalthough she is considered as a vessel of war, and commanded by\nofficers of the royal navy, the plan of her equipment is so singular,\nthat in addition, she requires the extra aid of one chief mate,\nand three under ones.",
        "[Royal Phillipine company.] The various modifications this corporate\nbody has successively experienced, have, in great measure, changed\nthe essence of its original constitution, and the remonstrances of\nits directors, founded on the experience of a long series of years, at\nlength induced the government at home to sanction alterations dictated\nby existing circumstances. The project of raising these Islands\nfrom the neglected state in which they were, and in some measure to\nplace them in contact with the mother country, accompanied by a wish\nto give a new and great impulse to the various branches of industry\nwhich constitute the importance of a colony, could not have been more\nlaudable; but, as was afterwards seen, the instrument employed was\nnot adequate to the object in view. At the same time that the company\nwere charged to promote, and, by means of their funds, to vivify the\nagriculture and industry of these provinces, the necessary powers\nand facilities to enable them to reap the fruits of their sacrifices\nwere withheld. The protection granted to this establishment, did not\ngo beyond a general recommendation in favor of its enterprises, and,\nin short, far from enjoying the exclusive preponderance obtained at\ntheir commencement by all the other Asiatic companies, that of the\nPhilippine Islands labored under particular disadvantages.",
        "[Local progress under adverse conditions.] Notwithstanding an\norganization so imperfect, scarcely had the agents of the new\nCompany arrived at Manila, when they distributed through the country\ntheir numerous dependents, commissioned to encourage the natives\nby advances of money. They established subaltern factories in the\nProvinces of Ilocos, Bataan, Cavite, and Camarines; purchased lands;\ndelivered out agricultural implements; founded manufacturies of cotton\ncloths; contracted for the crops of produce at very high prices;\noffered rewards and, in short, they put in motion every partial\nresources they were able to avail themselves of and their limited\nmeans allowed. It would be extremely easy for me, in this place,\nto enter a particular enumeration of the important services of this\nkind rendered by the company, and to exhibit, in the most evident\npoint of view, the advantages thence derived to these Islands,\nif, besides being slightly touched upon in the preceding articles,\nthis task had not been already ably performed by the Factor Don Juan\nFrancisco Urroz, in his accurate report on this subject, addressed\nto the governing committee of the company, in 1803. In justice I will\nnevertheless observe, that this establishment, anxiously resolved to\nattain the end proposed, in spite of so many obstacles, constantly\nfollowed up its expensive system without being disheartened; nor\ndid the contrarieties with which the Royal Audiencia, or High Court\nof Justice, frequently paralyzed its plans, the indifference of the\ngovernors, or the general opposition and jealousy of the other classes,\nin any way tend to relax its efforts, till at length, convinced of\nthe impossibility of successfully contending, alone and without any\nother arms than its own reduced capital; and, on the other hand,\nwell aware that a political body of this kind in vain seeks to unite\nwithin itself the triple and opposite characters of agriculturalist,\nmanufaturer, and merchant, a determination was taken to alter the\nplan, and withdraw the factories established in the provinces, and\nby adopting a rigid economy and confining the operations in future\nto the purchase of such produce and manufactured articles as suited\ntheir trade, and were voluntarily brought by the natives to their\nstores, the expenses of the Company were curtailed, and a plan of\nreform introduced into all their speculations. By this means also\nthey always secured an advantageous vent for the productions of the\ncountry, after having been the chief spring by which agriculture was\npromoted and encouraged in a direct manner.",
        "[Handicapped in outside trade] The most beneficial reform, however,\nintroduced by this establishment into its system, has, in reality,\nbeen derived from the variation or rather correction of its plans and\nenterprises, purely maritime. The government being desirous to increase\nthe relations of this colony by every possible means, and to convert it\ninto a common center of all the operations of the new company, at first\nrequired of the agents that the purchases and collection of goods from\nthe coast of Coromandel, Bengal, and China, destined for Spain, should\ntake place at Manila, either by purchasing the articles in that market,\nor through the medium of previous contracts to deliver them there. From\nthis it is easy to infer, that the company was infallibly exposed to\nthe harsh terms the respective contractors sought to impose upon them,\nas well with regard to prices as qualities, unless, in many cases,\nthey preferred being left without the necessary assortments. Hence may\nit, without the smallest exaggeration, be affirmed, that, summing up\nall the surcharges under which the shipments left the port of Manila,\nand comparing them with those which might have been sent direct from\nthe above-mentioned points, and without so extraordinary a détour\nas the one prescribed by law, the difference that followed in the\nprime cost of the cargos was not less than 80 per cent. The urgent\nmanner, however, in which the directors of the company did not\ncease to deplore and complain of so evident a hardship, at length\nhad the desired effect, and after existing ten or twelve years, so\npreposterous a system was successfully overthrown, and permission\nobtained from the king for the establishment of Spanish factories in\nthe neighborhood of the China and India manufactures, as well as the\npower of addressing shipments direct to those foreign dominions. The\nenlightened policy of their respective governments did not allow them\nto hesitate in giving a favorable reception to our factors and vessels,\nand the purchases and shipments of Asiatic goods being thus realized\nwithout the old obstructions, the Company was reasonably led to hope\nbeing able soon to increase its operations, and progressively present\nmore satisfactory results to the shareholders, when those political\nconvulsions succeeding soon after, which have unhinged or destroyed\nall the ordinary relations of trade, compelled them to abandon their\nhopes, till the wished-for calm should be again restored.",
        "[Temporary expedient of 1803.] In consequence of the new character\nand route given to the commercial enterprises of the Company, as\nauthorized by a royal decree of July 12, 1803, the functions of\nthe Manila factors were reduced to the annual shipment of a cargo\nof Asiatic goods to Peru, valued at $500,000, but only as long\nas the war lasted, and till the expiration of the extraordinary\npermits granted through the goodness of the king, and also to the\ntransmitting to China and Bengal of the specie brought from America,\nand the collecting of certain quantities of indigo, sugar, or other\nproduce of the Islands, with a view to gain by reselling it in the\nsame market. Consequently, the moment things return to their pacific\nand ordinary course, will be the period when the necessity of the\nfuture existence of this establishment will cease, or at least,\nwhen the propriety will be evident of its reform or assimilation to\nthe other commission houses, carrying on trade in Vera Cruz, Mexico,\netc., which, not being hired establishments, do not create expenses\nwhen they cease to transact business.",
        "[Competition of foreign merchants.] Against a measure of this kind\nit would be useless to allege, that, “by the exclusive privilege to\nintroduce spirits and European effects into the colony, the Company\nhas contracted the obligation of always keeping it properly supplied;\nthat their very institution had for the basis the general improvement\nof the Islands, and in order duly to comply with these duties, it\nbecomes indispensably necessary to keep up the present expensive\nestablishment;” for, in the first place, in order, to render it\nincumbent on the company to introduce an indefinite quantity of\nEuropean articles, it previously would be necessary to provide a vent\nfor them, and this can never be the case, unless the exclusion of all\ncompetitors in the market is rigorously carried into effect. As things\nnow are, the North Americans, English, French, and every other nation\nthat wishes, openly usurped this privilege, by constantly inundating\nthe Islands with spirits and all kinds of effects, and it is very\nevident that this same abuse which authorizes the infraction of the\nabove privilege, if in that light it could in any way be considered,\ntotally exonerates the company from all obligations by them contracted\nunder a different understanding. Besides, the circumstances which\nhave taken place since the publication of the royal decree, creating\nthe above establishment into a corporate body, in the year 1785,\nhave entirely changed the order established in this respect. In the\nfirst place, the port of Manila has been opened to foreign nations,\nin consequence of the distinterested representations of the company\nitself, and for the direct advantage of general trade; nor was it\nnecessary to prevent our new guests from abusing the facilities thus\ngranted to them, and much less to confine them to the mere introduction\nof Asiatic goods, the original plea made use of. In the second, as\nsoon as the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands became familiar with\nthe more useful and elegant objects of convenience and luxury, which\nthey were enabled to purchase from foreigners, at reasonable prices,\nit was natural for them to pay little regard to the superfluous aid\nof the company, more particularly when the latter were no longer\nable to sustain the competition, either in the sale or supply of a\nmultitude of articles, which, thanks to our own national simplicity,\nare scarcely known in Spain, whence their outward-bound cargoes are\ndivided. Hence it follows that, far from the importation and supplies\nof the company being missed, it may with great reason be presumed,\nthat this formal renunciation of this ideal privilege of theirs,\nmust rather have contributed to secure, in a permanent manner,\nadequate supplies for all the wants and whims of the inhabitants of\nthe colony; and that the publicity of such a determination would act\nas a fresh allurement successively to bring to the port of Manila a\nhost of foreign speculators, anxious to avail themselves of a fresh\nopening for commercial pursuits.",
        "[Company not a philanthropy.] The other objection, founded on the\nmistaken notion of its being inherent in, and belonging to, the very\nessence of the company, to promote the general improvement of the\nPhilippine Islands, if well considered, will appear equally unjust. It\nis, in fact, a ridiculous, although too generally received, a prejudice\nto suppose, that the founders of this establishment proposed to\nthemselves the plan of sinking the money of the shareholders in\nclearing the lands, and perfecting the rude manufactures of these\ndistant Islands. To imagine this to have been one of the principal\nobjects of the institution, or to suppose that, on this hard condition,\ntheir various privileges and exemptions were granted to them, is so\nfar from the reality of the fact, that it would only be necessary\nto read with attention the 26th article of the quoted royal decree\nof creation, in order more correctly to comprehend the origin and\nconstitutive system of this political body.",
        "“The latter,” says the Duke de Almodovar, “is reduced to two principal\npoints: the first of which is the carrying of the trade of Asia\nwith that of America and Europe; and the second, the encouragement\nand improvement of the productions and manufacturing industry of\nthe Islands. The one is the essential attribute of the company,\nconstituting its real character of a mercantile society; and, in the\nother respect, it becomes an auxiliary of the government, to whom\nthe duties alluded to more immediately belong.” If to the above we\nadd the preamble of the 43rd article of the new decree of 1803, the\nrecommendation, made to the company, to contribute to the prosperity\nof the agriculture and manufacturing industry of the Islands, will\nappear as a limited and secondary consideration; for even if the\nquestion were carried to extremes, it could never extend to any more\nthan the application of four per cent of the annual profits of the\ncompany indistinctly to both branches. If, however, any doubts still\nremained, the explanation or solution recently given to this question\nwould certainly remove them; because, by the simple fact of its being\nexpressed in the latter part of the aforesaid 43rd article, [Profit\npercent to go to Spain.] “That the above-mentioned four per cent was to\nbe laid out, with the king’s approbation, in behalf of the agriculture\nand manufacturing industry of Spain and the Philippine Islands,” it is\nclear that the king reserves and appropriates to himself the investment\nof the amount to be deducted from the general dividends, in order to\napply it where and how may be deemed most advisable. Consequently,\nfar from considering the company in that respect under an obligation to\ncontribute to the improvement of the Philippines exclusively, the only\nthing that can be required of them, when their charter is withdrawn,\nis, the repayment to the royal treasury of the four per cent on their\nprofits, for a purpose so vaguely defined. In following up this same\ntrain of argument, it would seem that, in order to render the amount\nto be deducted from the eventual profits of the company, in the course\nof time, a productive capital in the hands of the sovereign, the funds\nof the society not only ought not to be diverted to the continuation\nof projects which consume them, but, on the contrary, it is necessary\nto place at their disposal the direct means by which these funds can\nbe increased, in order to make up to the company in some measure the\nenormous losses experienced of late years, and at once free their\ncommerce from the shackles with which it has hitherto been obstructed.",
        "[Need of special privileges] Finally, after twenty-four years of\nimpotent and gratuitous efforts in the Philippines, and of the most\nobstinate opposition on the part of their rivals, it is now time for\nthe company, by giving up the ungrateful struggle, to reform in every\nrespect their expensive establishment in Manila, and to direct their\nprincipal endeavors to carry into effect the project so imperfectly\ntraced out in the new decree of 1803. The opinion of the most vehement\nenemies of the privileged bodies tacitly approves this exception in\ntheir favor. Adam Smith, avowedly hostile to all monopolies, feels\nhimself compelled to confess that, “without the incentives which\nexclusive companies offer to the individuals of a nation carrying\non little trade, possibly their confined capitals would cease to be\ndestined to the remote and uncertain enterprises which constitute a\ncommerce with the East Indies.”",
        "[Spanish commerce in its infancy.] Our commerce, compared with that\nof other nations, notwithstanding what may be said on this subject,\nis most assuredly yet in a state of infancy. That with Asia, more\nespecially, with the exception of the Royal Company, is almost unknown\nto all other classes. If it is, therefore, wished to exclude our many\nrivals from so lucrative a branch of trade as that which constitutes\nsupplies for the consumption of the Peninsula and its dependencies, the\nmeans are obvious. The most material fact is in fact already done. The\nnavigation to the various ports of Asia is familiar to the company’s\nnavy; their factors and clerks have acquired a practical knowledge of\nthat species of trade, essential to the undertaking, as well as such\ninformation as was at first unknown; but, after the great misfortune\nthis body has experienced, it will be indispensably necessary to aid\nand invigorate them with large supplies of money, following the example\nof other governments in similar cases; in order that the successful\nissue of their future operations may compensate their past losses,\nand worthily correspond with the magnitude of the object.",
        "[Philippines a burden to Spain.] This Asiatic colony, although\nconsidered as conferring great lustre on the crown and name of our\nmonarch, by exhibiting the vast extent of the limits of his dominions,\nhas in reality been, during a long series of years, a true burden\nto the government, or at least, a possession whose chief advantages\nhave redounded in favor of other powers, rivals of our maritime\nimportance. Notwithstanding all that has been said on the score of\nreal utility, certain it is, that the Philippine establishment has\ncost the treasury large sums of money; although, within the last\ntwenty-five or thirty years, it must be confessed that the public\nrevenues has experienced a considerable increase, and, of itself,\nhas become an object of some consequence to the state.",
        "[Profit from tobacco monopoly and foreign trade.] Among the various\ncauses which have contributed to produce so favorable an alteration,\nthe chief one have been the establishment of the tobacco monopoly,\non behalf of the crown, and the opening of the port of Manila to the\nflag of other nations, at peace with Spain. The first has considerably\nincreased the entries into the public treasury, and the second\nhas tended to multiply the general mass of mercantile operations,\nindependent of the other beneficial effects this last measure must\nhave produced in a country, whose resources, trade and consumption\nhad, from the time of the conquest, experienced the fatal shackles\nimposed by jealousy and ignorance.",
        "[Improvement in public finances.] The improved aspect the colony\nsoon assumed, by the introduction of this new system, as was natural,\nawakened the attention of ministers, and induced them more easily to\nconsent to the measures subsequently proposed to them, principally\nintended to place those distant dominions on a footing of permanent\nsecurity, so as to enable them to repel any fresh attempts on the part\nof an enemy. As, however, the productions of the country increased,\nthe public expenses also became greater, although always in a much\nsmaller proportion, with the exception of the interval between the\nyears 1797 and 1802, when the government, fearful of a second invasion,\nwas compelled, at its own expense, to provide against the danger with\nwhich these Islands were then threatened. If, therefore, as appears\nfrom the official reports of the treasurer-general, Larzabal, in my\npossession, the receipts at the treasury, in 1780, amounted only to\n$700,000 including the situado, or annual allowance for the expenses\nof government sent from New Spain, and after the ordinary charges of\nadministration had been paid, a surplus of $170,000 remained in the\nhands of the treasurer; at present we have the satisfaction to find\nthat the revenue is equal to $2,625,176.50 and the expenses do not\nexceed $2,179,731.87 by which means an annual surplus of $445,444.62\nis left, applicable to the payment of the debt contracted during the\nextraordinary period above mentioned, now reduced to about $900,000 and\nafterwards transferable to the general funds belonging to the crown.",
        "[Economy over Spanish-American colonial administration.] With regard\nto the administrative system, it is in every respect similar to the\none observed in our governments of America, with this difference only,\nthat, in the Philippine Islands, greater economy prevails in salaries,\nas well as in the number of persons employed. In former times, the\nestablishment of intendencies, or boards of administration, was deemed\nexpedient in Manila, Ilocos, Camarines, Iloilo, and Cebu; but they\nwere soon afterwards reformed, or rather laid aside, on account of\ntheir being deemed superfluous. I would venture to state the grounds\non which this opinion was then formed; but, as the sphere in which\nthe king’s revenue acts in these Islands increases and extends, which\nnaturally will be the case if the plans and improvements dictated\nby the present favorable circumstances are carried into effect, I do\nnot hesitate to say that it will be necessary again to appeal to the\nestablishment of a greater number of boards for the management and\ncollection of the various branches of the revenue, whether they are\ncalled intendencies, or by any other name; as it will be extremely\ndifficult for the administration to do its duty, on the confined and\ninadequate plan under which it is at present organized.",
        "[Fiscal system.] Under its existing form, it is constituted in the\nfollowing manner: The governor of the Islands, in his quality of\nsuperintendent or administrator general, and as uniting in himself\nthe powers of intendent of the army, presides at the board of\nadministration of the king’s revenue, which is placed in the immediate\ncharge of a treasurer and two clerks. The principal branches have their\nrespective general directors, on whom the provincial administrators\ndepend, and the civil magistrates, in the quality of sub-delegates,\ncollect within their respective districts, the tributes paid by the\nnatives in money and produce, and manage everything else relating\nto the king’s revenue. In ordinary cases, the general laws of the\nIndies govern, and especially are the ordinances or regulations of\nthe Intendents of New Spain (Mexico) ordered to be observed in the\nPhilippines. It ought further to be observed, that, in these Islands,\nthe same as in all the vice-royalties and governments of America, there\nis a distinct body of royal decrees in force, which, in themselves,\nconstitute a code of considerable size.",
        "[Opposition to tobacco monopoly.] The process of converting the\nconsumption of tobacco into a monopoly met with a most obstinate\nresistance on the part of the inhabitants, and the greatest\ncircumspection and constancy were necessary for the governor, Don\nJosé Basco, to carry this arduous enterprise into effect. Accustomed\nto the cultivation of this plant without any restriction whatever,\nand habituated to its use from their infancy, it appeared to the people\nthe extreme of rashness to seek simultaneously to extirpate it from the\nface of the greatest part of the Island of Luzon, in order to confine\nits culture within the narrow limits of a particular district. They\nwere equally revolted at the idea of giving to a common article a\nhigh and arbitrary value, when, besides, it had become one of the\nfirst necessity. Every circumstance, however, being dispassionately\nconsidered, and the principle once admitted that it was expedient for\nthe colony to maintain itself by means the least burdensome to the\ninhabitants, it certainly must be acknowledged that, although odious\non account of its novelty and defective in the mode of its execution,\na resource more productive and at the same time less injurious, could\nnot have been devised. Hence was it that the partisans of the opposite\nsystem were strangely misled, by founding their calculation on false\ndata, when they alleged that a substitute, equivalent to the increased\nrevenue supposed to arise out of the monopoly of tobacco, might have\nbeen resorted to by ordering a proportionate rise in the branch of\ntributes. In fact, no one who had the least experience in matters of\nthis kind, can be ignorant of the open repugnance the natives have\nalways evinced to the payment of the ordinary head-tax (cedula),\nand the broils to which its collection has given rise. Besides,\nif well examined, no theory is more defective and more oppressive\non account of the disparity with which it operates, than this same\nwrongly-boasted impost; for, however desirous it may be to simplify\nthe method of collecting the general revenue of a state, if the best\nplan is to be adopted, that is, if public burdens are to be rendered\nthe least obnoxious, it is necessary preferably to embrace the system\nof indirect contribution, in which class, to a certain degree, the\nmonopoly of all those articles may be considered as included which are\nnot rigorously of the first necessity, and only compel the individual\nto contribute when his own will induce him to become a consumer.",
        "[Doubling of insular revenue thru tobacco.] Let this be as it may,\ncertain it is, that to Governor Basco we are indebted for having\ndoubled the annual amount of the revenue of these Islands, by merely\nrendering the consumption of tobacco subservient to the wants of the\ncrown. It was he who placed these Islands in the comfortable situation\nof being able to subsist without being dependent on external supplies\nof money to meet the exigencies of government. It ought, however, to\nbe remarked that, although they have been in the habit of receiving\nthe annual allowance of $250,000 for which a standing credit was\nopened by the government at home on the general treasury of New\nSpain, considerable sums have, nevertheless, on various occasions,\nbeen remitted from the Philippines to Spain, through the channel of\nthe Captain-General. * * * If these remittances have been suspended\nfor some years past, it has evidently been owing to the imperious\nnecessity of applying the ordinary proceeds of the revenue, as well\nas other extraordinary means, to unforeseen contingencies arising\nout of peculiar circumstances.",
        "[Tobacco belt.] The planting and cultivation of tobacco are now\nconfined to the district of Gapan, in Pampanga Province, to that of\nCagayan, and to the small Island of Marinduque. The amount of the\ncrops raised in the above three points and sold to the king, may,\non an average, be estimated at fifty thousand bales, grown in the\nfollowing proportion: Gapan, forty-seven thousand bales; Cagayan,\ntwo thousand, and Marinduque, one thousand. This stock, resold at the\nmonopoly prices, yields a sum equal to about one million of dollars,\nand deducting therefrom the prime cost and all other expenses,\nlegally chargeable on this branch, the net proceeds in favor of the\nrevenue amount to $550,000 or upwards of one hundred twenty-two per\ncent. This profit is so much more secure, as it rests on the positive\nfact that, however great the quantity of the article sold furtively and\nby evading the vigilance of the guards, as the demand and consumption\nare excessive and always exceed the stock on hand, a ready sale cannot\nfail to be had for all the stock placed in the hands of the agents\nof the monopoly. From this it may also be inferred how much the net\nproceeds of this branch would be increased, if without venturing too\nfar in extending the plantations and consequent purchases, care was\ntaken to render the supplies more proportionate to the consumption;\nfor, by a clear profit of one hundred twenty-two per cent, falling\non a larger capital, it follows that a corresponding result would\nbe obtained. In a word, the sales, far from declining or being in\nany way deemed precarious, are susceptible of a great increase,\nconsequently this branch of revenue merits the serious attention of\ngovernment beyond all others.",
        "[Defective sales system.] It is, however, to be lamented that,\ninstead of every facility being given to the sale of tobacco and the\nconsumption thus encouraged, the public meet with great difficulties\nand experience such frequent obstacles and deficiencies in the\nsupplies, that with truth it may also be said, the sales are affected\nin spite of the administrators themselves. In the capital alone it\nis a generally received opinion that a third part more would there\nbe consumed, if, instead of compelling the purchaser to receive the\ntobacco already manufactured or folded, he was allowed to take it from\nthe stores in its primitive state; and if the minor establishments\nin the provinces were constantly supplied with good qualities, an\ninfinitely larger quantity might be sold, and by this means a great\ndeal of smuggling also prevented. Such, however, is the neglect and\nirregularity in this department, that it frequently happens in towns\nsomewhat distant from Manila, no other tobacco is to be met with\nthan what the smugglers sell, and if, perchance, any is to be found\nin the monopoly stores, it is usually of the worst quality that can\nbe imagined.",
        "[Loss from preventable causes.] I pass over, in silence, the other\ndefects gradually introduced, as evils, in a greater or lesser degree,\ninseparable from this part of public administration in every country\nin which it has been deemed necessary to establish monopolies; but I\ncannot refrain from again insisting on the urgency with which those\nin power ought to devote themselves, firmly and diligently, to the\ndestruction of abuses which have hitherto paralyzed the progress of\nthe branch in question, because I am well persuaded, that, whenever\ncorresponding means are adopted, it will be possible in a short\ntime to double the proceeds. What these means are, it is not easy,\nnor indeed essential, to particularize in a rapid sketch, like this,\nof the leading features and present state of the Philippine Islands. I\nshall, therefore, merely remark, that it will be in vain to wish the\npersons engaged in the management of this department to exert their\nreal zeal and sincerely co-operate in the views of government, as\nlong as they are not placed beyond the necessity of following other\npursuits and gaining a livelihood in another way; in a word, unless\nthey have a salary assigned them, corresponding to the confidence and\nvalue of the important object entrusted to their charge, no plan of\nreform can be rendered efficient.",
        "[Abuses by revenue officers.] At the same time steps are taken to\naugment the revenue arising out of tobacco, it would be desirable,\nas much as possible, to improve the methods used with regard to those\nwho gather in the crops, by endeavoring to relieve them from the heavy\nconditions imposed upon them; conditions which, besides exposing them\nto the odious effects of revenue-laws, by their very nature bring upon\nthem many unpleasant consequences, and often total ruin. In order that\na correct opinion may be formed of these defects, it will suffice to\nobserve that, under pretext of preventing smuggling, the guards and\ntheir agents watch, visit, and, if I may use the expression, live\namong the plantations from the moment the tobacco-seedlings appear\nabove ground, till the crops are gathered in. After compelling the\nFilipino planter to cut off the head of the stem, in order that the\nplant may not become too luxurious, the surveyors then proceed to\nset down, not only the number of plants cultivated on each estate,\nbut even the very leaves of each, distinguishing their six qualities,\nin order to call the farmers to account, respectively, when they\nmake a defective delivery into the general stores. In the latter\ncase, they are compelled to prove the death of the plants and even\nto account for the leaves missing when counted over again, under the\npenalty of being exposed to the rigor of the revenue laws.",
        "[Burdensome and unprofitable inspection.] It cannot indeed be denied\nthat by this means two important objects are attained, at one and the\nsame time; the one, the gradual improvement of the tobacco, and the\nother, the greater difficulty of secreting the article; but, on the\nother hand, how great are the inconveniences incurred? Independent of\nthe singularity and consequent oppression of a regulation of this kind,\nas well as its too great minuteness and complication, it is attended\nwith very considerable expenses, and renders it necessary to keep on\nfoot a whole army of guards and clerks, who tyrannize over and harass\nthe people without any real motive for such great scrupulosity and\nprofusion. I make this observation because I cannot help thinking\nthat the same results might nearly be obtained, by adopting a more\nsimple and better regulated system. I am not exactly aware of the one\nfollowed in the Island of Cuba, but as far as I understand the matter,\nit is simply reduced to this: the growers there merely present their\nbales to the inspectors, and if pronounced to be sound and good, the\nstipulated amount is paid over to them; but if the quality is bad,\nthe whole is invariably burnt. Thus all sales detrimental to the\npublic revenue are prevented, and I do not see why the same steps\ncould not be taken in the Philippine Islands. It must not, however,\nbe understood, that I presume to speak in a decisive tone on a subject\nso extremely delicate, and that requires great practical information,\nwhich, I readily acknowledge, I do not possess. I merely wish by means\nof these slight hints, to contribute to the commencement of a reform\nin abuses, and to promote the adoption of a plan that may have for\nbasis the relief of the growers, and at the same time advance the\nprosperity of this part of the royal revenue.",
        "[Coco and nipa wine monopoly.] The monopoly of coco and nipa, or\npalm-wine, is a branch of public revenue of sufficient magnitude to\nmerit the second place among the resources rendered available to\nthe expenditure of these Islands, converted into a monopoly some\nyears ago. In like manner as the consumption of tobacco, it has\nexperienced several changes in its plan of administration, this\nbeing at one time carried on, for account of the king, at others,\nby the privilege being let out at auction; till at length the Board\nof Control, convinced of the great profit gained by the contractors,\nresolved at once to take the direction of this departure under their\nown charge, and make arrangement for its better administration. Having\nwith this view established general deposits and licensed houses for\nthe sale of native wine, with proper superintending clerks they soon\nbegan to reap the fruits of so judicious a determination. In 1780,\nthe privilege of selling the coco and nipa wine was farmed out, to the\nhighest bidder, for no more than $45,200 and subsequently the increase\nhas been so great, owing to the improvements adopted, that at present\nnet proceeds equal to $200,000 on an average may be relied upon. In\nproof of this, the proceeds of this branch, in the year 1809, may be\nquoted, when the total balances received at the Treasury, after all\nexpenses had been paid, amounted to $221,426, in the following manner:",
        "Administration of Manila and district $201,250\nAdministration of La Pampanga and district 12,294\nAdministration of Pangasinan and district 7,882\n ––\n $221,426",
        "The prime cost and other expenses that year amounted to no more than\n$168,557 by which means, on the whole operation, a net profit of\nthirteen and one-half per cent. resulted in favor of the treasury.",
        "[Wine monopoly district.] The monopoly of native wine comprehends\nthe whole of the Island of Luzon, excepting the Provinces of Cagayan,\nZambales, Nueva Ecija, Camarines and Albay, and is under the direction\nof three administrators, who act independently of each other in their\nrespective districts, and have at their disposal a competent number\nof guards. These administrators receive in the licensed establishments\nthe coco and nipa wines, at prices stipulated by the growers. That of\nthe coco is paid for at the rate of two dollars per jar, containing\ntwenty gantas, equal to twelve arrobas, seven azumbres and half a\ncuartillo, Castilian measure, and at fourteen reals in the places\nnearest the depots. The nipa wine is laid at six and one-half reals\nthe jar, indistinctly; prices which, although extremely low, are still\nconsidered advantageous by the Filipinos themselves, more particularly\nwhen it is besides understood, that, from the circumstance of their\nbeing growers of this article, they are exempted from military service,\nas well as several other taxes and public charges.",
        "[Coco-wine.] The coco-wine is a weak spirit, obtained in the following\nmanner: The tree that produces this fruit is crowned by an assemblage\nof large flowers or corollas, from the center or calix of which issues\na fleshy stem, filled with juice. The Indian cuts the extremity of\nthis stem, and inclining the remainder in a lateral manner, introduces\nit into a large hollow tube which remains suspended, and is found\nfull of sweet and sticky liquor, which the tree in this manner yields\ntwice in every twenty-four hours. [\"Tuba”.] This liquid, called tuba,\nin the language of the country, is allowed to ferment for eight days\nin a large vessel, and afterwards distilled by the Indians in their\nuncouth stills, which are no other than large boilers, with a head\nmade of lead or tin, rendered tight by means of clay, and with a\npipe frequently made out of a simple cane, which conveys the spirit\nto the receiving vessels, without passing, like the serpentine tube\nused in ordinary stills, through the cooling vats, which so greatly\ntends to correct the vices of a too quick evaporation. The tuba,\nobtained in level and hot situations, is much more spirituous than\nthat produced in cold and shady places. In the first, six jars of\njuice are sufficient to yield one of spirit, and in the latter,\nas many as eight are requisite; a much greater number, however,\nwould be wanted to rectify this spirit so as to render it equal to\nwhat is usually known by Hollands proof. I am not positively certain\nwhat degree of strength the coco-brandy, or as it is usually called\ncoco-wine, possesses, but it is evidently inferior to the weakest made\nin Spain from the juice of the grape. The only circumstance required\nfor it to be approved of, and received into the monopoly-stores,\nis its being easily ignited by the application of a lighted candle.",
        "[Nipa brandy.] The nipa is a small tree of the class of palms, which\ngrows in a very bushy form, and multiplies and prospers greatly on\nthe margins of rivers and watery tracts of land. The tuba, or juice,\nis extracted from the tree whilst in its flowering state, in the same\nway as that of the coco, and afterwards distilled by a similar process;\nbut it is more spirituous, from six to six and a half jars being\nsufficient to yield one of wine. The great difference remarked in the\nprices of these two species of liquor, arises out of the great number\nof uses to which the fruit of the cocal or coco tree is applicable,\nand the increase of expense and labor requisite to obtain the juice,\nowing to the great height of the plant, and the frequent dangers to\nwhich the caritones, or gatherers, are exposed in passing from one\ntree to another, which they do by sliding along a simple cane (bamboo).",
        "[Little drunkenness.] The impost on, or rather monopoly of, native\nwine, is in itself little burdensome to the community, as it only\nfalls on the lower and most dissipated orders in society, and for this\nreason it is not susceptible of the same increase as that of tobacco,\nof which the use is more general, and now become an object of the\nfirst necessity. The native of the Philippine Islands is, by nature,\nso sober, that the spectacle of a drunken man is seldom noticed in\nthe streets; in the capital, where the most corrupt classes of them\nreside, it is admirable to see the general abstinence from a vice\nthat degrades the human species. The consumption of the coco and\nnipa wine is, nevertheless, considerable, for it is used in all their\nfestivities, cockfights, games, marriages, etc. Accordingly if it is\ndesired to augment the annual sale of these liquors, no way could be\nmore efficient than to increase the number of their festive meetings,\nand seek pretexts to encourage public diversions, so long as these do\nnot go contrary to the well-regulated order of society, and conflict\nwith the duties of those who are intrusted with its superintendence.",
        "[Extension of monopoly urged.] I am still of opinion, however, that,\nwithout resting the prosperity of this branch of the public revenue on\nprinciples possessed of so immoral a tendency, it might be rendered\nmore productive to the treasury, if the monopoly could be introduced\ninto the other districts adapted to its establishment. By this I\nmean to say that, as hitherto the monopoly has been partial, and\nenforced more in the way of a trial than in a general and permanent\nmanner, much remains to be done, and consequently great scope is\nleft for improvement in this department of the public revenue. This\nmost assuredly may be attained, if all the local circumstances and\nimpediments, more or less superable, which the matter itself presents,\nare only taken into due account, and proper exertions made to study\nand discover the various indirect means of increasing the total mass\nof contributions, by applying a system more productive and analogous\nto the nature of the Philippine Islands. With regard to the revenue of\nthe two particular articles above treated on, I merely wish to make\nit understood that, far from introducing by means of the monopoly,\na new vice into the provinces in which I recommend its establishment,\nit would rather act, in a certain degree at least, as a corrective\nto pre-existing evils, and the government would derive advantages\nfrom an article of luxury, by subjecting its consumption to the\nsame shackles under which it stands in the northern provinces, where\nits administration is established and carried on for account of the\nroyal treasury.",
        "[Former customs usage.] In former times, when only vessels belonging to\nthe Asiatic nations visited the port of Manila, with effects from the\ncoast of Coromandel, or the China junks, and now and then a Spanish\nvessel coming from or going to the Island of Java, with spices for\naccount of Philippine merchants, the receipt of duties was left in\ncharge of a single royal officer, and the valuations of merchandise\nmade by him, in concert with two merchants named by the government; but\nwith the knowledge and assistance of the king’s attorney-general. The\nmodifications and changes which have subsequently taken place in this\ndepartment have, however, been frequent, as is evidently shown by the\nhistorical extract from the proceedings instituted before the Council\nof the Indies, by the merchants of Seville and Cadiz, in opposition to\nthose of the Philippine Islands, printed in Madrid, 1736, in folio,\nby order of the said council; but as it does not enter into my views\nto speak of times so remote, I shall confine my remarks to this branch\nconsidered under its present form.",
        "[Custom house.] In conformity to royal orders of March 15 and May 5,\n1786, the Royal Custom House of Manila was definitively organized on\nits new plan; and from 1788, was placed under the immediate charge\nof an administrator-general, a controller, a treasurer, aided by a\ncompetent number of guards, inspectors, etc., and in every respect\nregulated on the plan established in the other custom houses. The\nfreedom of the port being granted to foreign nations, a privilege\nbefore enjoyed only by those purely Asiatic, and a new line of trade\ncommenced by the company, the competition in merchandise soon began\nto increase, as well as the revenue arising therefrom, in such manner\nthat, although the exportation of goods was limited to the cargo of\nthe Acapulco ship, of which the duties are not payable till her arrival\nthere; notwithstanding also the property imported by the company from\nChina and India, and destined for their own shipments, was exempt\nfrom duties, and above all, the continual interruptions experienced\nby the maritime commerce of the Islands within the last fifteen or\ntwenty years, the net proceeds of the custom house, from the period\nabove mentioned of its establishment, till the close of 1809, have not\nbeen less than from $138,000 to $140,000, on an average, independent\nof the amount of the king’s fifth on the gold of the country, which\nis collected by the same administrator, in consequence of its being\ntrivial; as well as the two per cent. belonging to the Board of Trade,\nand by them collected under that title, and afterwards separately\napplied to the average-fund and which usually may be estimated from\n$20,000 to $25,000.",
        "The general duties now levied in the custom house, are the following:",
        "[Port charges and duties.] Six per cent. almojarisfago is on all\nkinds of merchandise imported in foreign bottoms, under a valuation\nmade by the surveyors, in conformity to the respective prices of\nthe market at the time on importation; it usually is regulated by\nan increase of 50% on the prime cost of India goods, and of 33 1/3%\non those from China. This duty may be considered as, in fact, equal\nto nine per cent on the former, and eight on the latter.",
        "Six per cent, or the same duty, on all foreign goods, although imported\nin national bottoms.",
        "Three per cent on Spanish goods, imported under the national flag,\nequal, according to the above estimate to 4 and 4 1/2%.",
        "Two per cent Board of Trade duty, indistinctly on all foreign property,\nequivalent to 2 1/2 or 3%.",
        "Twenty-five per cent anchorage dues, levied on the total amount of\nthe almojarisfago duty.",
        "An additional of two and one-half per cent, a new and temporary duty,\ncalled subvencion, appropiated to the payment of the loan made to\nthe king by the Cadiz Board of Trade, and leviable on all kinds of\nimported goods, and, of course, equal, according to the usual mode\nof valuation, to about three per cent.",
        "Three per cent on the exportation of coined silver and gold of the\ncountry, in dust and, ingots.",
        "An additional or duty of subvencion, or temporary duty on the above,\nequal to one-half per cent.",
        "One and a half per cent under the same rate, on all kinds of goods,\nand equal to two or two and one half per cent.",
        "One and one-half per cent on the amount of the cargo of the Acapulco\nship, on leaving the port of Manila, equal to 3/4% on the real\nprime cost.",
        "[Slight concession to the Company.] The company are considered in\nthe same light as the rest of the merchants, in the graduation and\npayment of duties, on such goods as they sell out of their own stores\nfor local consumption, to the Company, with the exemption only of\nthe Board of Trade rate of 2% and 3%, on the exportation of silver,\naccording to a special privilege, and in conformity to the 61st\nArticle of the new royal decree of 1803.",
        "Besides the duties above enumerated, there is another trifling one\nestablished for local purposes of peso merchante, being a rate for the\nuse of the king’s scales, levied according to an extremely equitable\ntariff, on certain articles only of solid weight, such as iron, copper,\netc. The raw materials as well as all kinds of manufactured articles,\nbelonging to the Islands, are exempt from duties on their entry in\nthe port and river of Manila; but some of the first are subject to\nthe most unjust of all exactions, that is, to an arbitrary tax and\nto the obligation of being retailed out on board the vessels in which\nthey have been brought down, and deliverable only to persons bearing\na written order, signed by the sitting members of the municipal\ncorporation. Among this class of articles may be mentioned the coco\nof Cebu and the wax and oil of the Bisayas, which are rated as objects\nof the first necessity.",
        "[Undervaluation of galleon goods.] With regard to the respective\nduties on the cargo annually dispatched by the merchants of Manila\nto New Spain, the practice of galleon is tolerably well regulated. An\nextreme latitude is given to the moderate rates at which it is ordered\nto value the goods contained in the manifest, by which means these are\nfrequently put down at only one-half of their original prime cost;\nthe commission to frame the scale of valuations which is to be in\nforce for five years, after which time it is renewed, being left\nto three merchants, and made subject to the revision of the king’s\nattorney-general (fiscal) and the approbation of the governor;\nconsequently, such being the nature of the tariff on which these\noperations are founded, the 33 1/3% to which the royal duties amount\non the $500,000 stipulated in the permit, does not, in fact, affect\nthe shipper beyond the rate of 15 per cent, in consequence of the\ngreat difference between the prime cost and valuation of the articles\ncorresponding to the permit; or, what is the same thing, between\nthe $500,000 nominal value, and $1,100,000 or $1,200,000, the real\namount of the cargo in question. The most remarkable circumstance,\nhowever, is, that the officers of the revenue in Acapulco collect\nthe above-mentioned 33 1/3% in absolute conformity to the Manila\nvaluation, and not according to the value of the goods in America,\nand without any other formality than a comparison of the cargo with\nthe ship’s papers. In honor of truth, it ought to be further observed\nthat, although the Manila merchant by this means seeks to exempt\nhimself from the part of the enormous duties with which it has been\nattempted to paralyze the only commercial intercourse he carries on\nwith New Spain, in every other respect connected with this operation,\nhe acts in a sufficiently legal manner, and if at their return those\nvessels have been in the habit of bringing back near a million of\ndollars in a smuggled way, it must be acknowledged that it is the\nharshness of the law which compels the merchant to become a smuggler;\nfor according to the strange regulation by which he is thwarted in the\nreturns representing the proceeds of his outward operation, he must\neither bring the money to the Philippine Islands without having it\ndeclared on the ship’s papers, or be obliged to leave the greatest\npart of it in the hands of others, subject to such contingencies\nas happen in trade. As long, therefore, as the present limitations\nsubsist, which only authorize returns equal to double the value of\nthe outward-bound cargo, this species of contraband will inevitably\ncontinue. The governors also, actuated by the principles of reason\nand natural justice, will, as they have hitherto done, wink at the\ninfraction of the fiscal laws; a forbearance, in fact, indirectly\nbeneficial to them, inasmuch as it eventually contributes to the\ngeneral improvement of the colony. Indeed, without this species of\njudicious condescension, trade would soon stand still for the want\nof the necessary funds to carry it on.",
        "[Unbusinesslike custom ways.] .... It will readily be acknowledged\nthat, in like manner as the good organization of custom houses is\nfavorable to the progress of general commerce, so nothing is more\ninjurious to its growth and the enterprise of merchants, than any\nuncertainty or arbitrary conduct in the levying of duties to be\npaid by them. This arises out of the circumstance of every merchant,\nentering on a new speculation, being anxious to have, as the principal\nground work of his combinations, a perfect knowledge of the exact\namount of his disbursements, in order to be enabled to calculate the\nfinal result with some degree of certainty. Considered in this point\nof view, the system adopted in the Islands is certainly deplorable,\nsince it must be acknowledged that the principles and common rules of\nall other commercial countries, are there unknown. For example; this\nyear a cargo arrives from China or Bengal, and the captain turns in\nhis manifest. The custom-house surveyors then commence the valuation\nof the goods of which his cargo is composed: I say they commence,\nbecause it is a common thing for them not to have finished the estimate\nof the scale and amount of corresponding duties, till the expiration\nof two, four, and not unfrequently six months. The rule they affect to\nfollow, in this valuation, is that of the prices current in the market,\nand in order to ascertain what these are, they are seen going round\ninquiring in the shops of the Sangleys (Chinese), till at length,\nfinding it useless to go in search of correct and concurrent data,\nin a place where there are neither brokers nor public auctions, they\nare forced to determine in an arbitrary manner, and as the adage goes,\nalways take good care to see their employers on the right side of the\nhedge. The grand work being ended, with all this form and prolixity,\nthe sentence of the surveyors is irrevocable. The bondsman of the\ncaptain, who, in the meanwhile, has usually sold his cargo and departed\nwith a fresh one for another destination, pays in the amount of the\nduties, thus regulated by law.",
        "[Variations in valuations.] The practical defects and injurious\nconsequences of such a system as this, it would be unnecessary\nto particularize. It would, however, be less intolerable, if,\nonce put in force, it could serve the merchant as a guide in the\nvaluations of his property for a determined number of successive\nyears. What, however, renders this assessment more prejudicial,\nis its instability and uncertainty, and the repetition of the same\noperation I have just described every year, and with every cargo that\narrives; but under distinct valuations, according to the reports\nor humor of the day. Besides these great defects and irregularity,\nthe Philippine custom house observes the singular practice of not\nallowing the temporary landing of goods entered in transitu and for\nre-exportation, as is done on the bonding system in all countries\nwhere exertions are made by those in authority for the extension and\nimprovement of commerce in every possible way. Of course, much less\nwill they consent to the drawback or return of any part of the duties\non goods entered outwards, even though they are still on board the\nvery vessels in which they originally came shipped. Beyond all doubt,\nthe wrongly understood severity of such a system, has, and will,\ncontinue to prevent many vessels from frequenting the port of Manila,\nand trying the market, unable to rely on the same liberal treatment\nthey can meet with in other places.",
        "[The areca-nut.] The bonga, or areca-nut, is the fruit of a very\nhigh palm-tree, not unlike the one that bears the date, and the\nnuts, similar to the latter, hang in great clusters from below the\nprotuberance of the leaves or branches. Its figure and size resemble\na common nut, but solid, like the nutmeg. Divided into small pieces,\nit is placed in the center of a small ball made of the tender leaves\nof the buyo or betel pepper, lightly covered with slacked lime,\nand this composition constitutes the celebrated betel of Asia, or,\nas it is here called, the buyo, the latter differing from that used\nin India, inasmuch only as it contains cardamomom.",
        "[Buyo monopoly unsatisfactory.] The government, anxious to derive\nadvantage in aid and support of the colony, from the great use the\ninhabitants make of the buyo, many years ago determined to establish\nthe sale of the bonga, its principal ingredient, into a monopoly,\neither by hiring the privilege out, or placing it under a plan of\nadministration, in the form in which it now stands. Both schemes have\nbeen tried, but neither way has this branch been made to yield more\nthan $30,000; indeed the annual proceeds usually have not exceeded\n$25,000. In 1809, the total amount of sales was $48,610, and deducting\nfrom this sum the prime cost and expenses of administration, the net\nprofit in favor of the treasury was equal to no more than $27,078 or\nupwards of 125 1/2%. In 1780, the privilege of selling the bonga was\nlet out at public auction for the sum of $15,765 and this, compared\nwith the present proceeds, clearly shows that, although the increase\nhas not advanced equally with the other branches of the revenue, it is\nfar from having declined. It must nevertheless be confessed, that on\nthe present footing on which it stands, the smallness of the proceeds\nis not worth the trouble required in the collection, and even if the\namount were still greater, it could never serve as an excuse for the\noppression and violence to which this monopoly frequently gives rise.",
        "[Hardships on areca-nut planters.] As the trees producing the bonga\nare not confined to any particular grounds, and indiscriminately grow\nin all, the plan has been adopted of compelling the Filipinos to gather\nand bring in the fruit, raised on their lands, to the depot nearest the\ndistrict in which they reside. There they are paid from two, two and\none-half, three and three and one-half reals per thousand, according\nto the distance from which they come: and, in order to prevent frauds,\nthe surveyors belonging to the revenue go out, at certain times of the\nyear, to examine the bonga plantations, and the trees being counted,\nthey estimate the fruit, that is, oblige the proprietor to undertake\nto deliver in two hundred nuts for each bearing tree, whether or not,\nhurricanes deteriorate or destroy the produce, or thieves plunder\nthe plantations, as very frequently happens. In case deficiencies are\nproved against him, he is compelled to pay for them in money, at the\nrate of twenty-five reals per thousand, the price at which the king\nsells them in the monopoly-stores. Besides, the precise condition of\ndelivering in two hundred bonga nuts, according to the stipulations\nimposed upon him, presupposes the previous exclusion of all the injured\nor green ones; and although the ordinary trees usually yield as many as\nthree hundred nuts each, great numbers are nevertheless spoiled. If, to\nthe adverse accidents arising out of the storms and robberies, we add\nthe effects of the whims or ill-humor of the receivers, it is not easy\nto imagine to what a length the injuries extend which befall the man\nwho has the folly or misfortune to become a planter of this article.",
        "[Folly of monopoly plan.] On the other hand, as in the conveyances\nfrom the minor to the larger depots, frauds are frequently committed,\nand the heaping together of many millions of nuts inevitably produces\nthe fermentation and rapid putrefaction of a great number of them,\nit consequently follows that the waste must be immense; or if it is\ndetermined to sell all the stock laid in, without any distinction in\nquality and price, the public must be very badly served and displeased,\nas in fact too often happens. Since, therefore, the habit of using\nthe buyo is still more prevailing than that of tobacco, when suitable\nsupplies cannot be had in the monopoly stores, the consumer naturally\nresorts to the contraband channels, although he encounters some risk,\nand expends more money. It is also very natural that the desire of\ngain should thus lead on and daily expose a number of needy persons,\nanxious by this means to support and relieve the wants of their\nfamilies. Returning, however, to what more immediately concerns the\ngrower, I do not know that the oppressive genius of fiscal laws has,\nin any country of the globe, invented one more refinedly tyrannic,\nthan to condemn a man, to a certain degree at least, as has hitherto\nbeen the case, to the punishment of Tantalus; for the law forbids the\nFilipino to touch the fruit of the tree planted with his own hands,\nand which hangs in tempting and luxuriant abundance round his humble\ndwelling.",
        "[Its modification desirable.] It would be easy for me to enumerate\nmany other inconveniences attending this branch of public revenue,\non the footing on which it now stands, if what has already been said\ndid not suffice to point out the necessity of changing the system,\nas those in authority are anxious that the treasury should gain more,\nand the king’s subjects suffer less. The strong prejudice entertained\nagainst this source of revenue, the inconsiderable sum it produces,\nand the complicated form of its organization, have in reality been\nsufficient motives to induce many to become strenous advocates for\nthe total abolition of the monopoly. I do not, however, on this\naccount see any reasons for altogether depriving the government of\na productive resource, as this might soon be rendered, if it was\nplaced under regulations less odious and more simple in themselves. I\nnevertheless agree, that the perfect monopoly of the areca fruit, or\nbonga, is impracticable, till the trees, indiscriminately planted,\nare cut down, and, in the same way as the tobacco plantations,\nfresh and definite grounds are laid out for its cultivation, on\naccount of the revenue. I am further aware that this measure is\nless practicable than the first; for, independent of all the other\nobstacles, it would be necessary to wait till the new plantation\nyielded fruit, and also that the public should consent to refrain\nfrom masticating buyo in the meanwhile, a pretension as mad as it\nwould be to require that the eating of salt should be dispensed with\nfor a given number of years. But what difficulty would there be,\nfor example, in the proprietors paying so much a year for each bonga\ntree to the district magistrate, the governor of the nearest town,\nor the cabeza de Barangay, or chiefs of the clans into which the\nnatives are divided, in the same manner as the Filipino pays his\ntribute? [Tree-tax preferable.] The only one I anticipate is that of\nfixing the amount in such way that, at the same time this resource is\nmade to produce an increased income of some moment, it may act as a\nmoderate tax on an indefinite property, the amount of which, augmented\nin the same price, may be reimbursed to the proprietor by the great\nbody of consumers. It is not in fact easy to foresee or estimate,\nby any means of approximation, the alteration in the current price\nof the bonga, that would result from the indefinite freedom of its\ncultivation and sale, especially during the first years. Although,\nfor this reason, it would be impossible to ascertain what proportion\nthe impost on the tree would then bear with regard to the value of\nthe fruit, the error that might accrue would be of little moment, as\nlong as precautions were taken to adopt a very low rate of comparison,\nand a proportionably equitable one as the basis of taxation. Supposing\nthen that the price of the bonga should decline from twenty-five reals,\nat which it is now sold in the monopoly stores, to fifteen reals per\nthousand, in the general market, and a tax of one-fourth real should\nbe laid on each tree valued at two hundred bonga nuts, it is clear\nthat this would be equal to no more than 8 1/2%; or, what is the same,\nthe tax would be in the proportion one to twelve with the proceeds of\neach tree, and the more the value of the fruit was raised, the more\nwould the rate of contribution diminish. It ought at the same time\nto be observed that, under the above estimate, that is, supposing the\nprice of the article to remain at fifteen reals, the 8 1/2% at which\nrate the tax is regulated, would not perhaps exceed five or six per\ncent on a more minute calculation; in the first place, because at the\ntime of making out the returns of the trees, [Exception of immature\nand aged trees.] those only ought to be set down which are in their\nfull vigor, excluding such as through the want or excess of age only\nyield a small proportion of fruit; and in the second, because in\nthe numbers registered, the trees would only be rated at two hundred\nalthough it is well known they usually yield three hundred, in order\nby this means the better to avoid all motives of complaint. In this\npoint of view, and by adopting similar rules of probability, it seems\nto me that the government would not risk much by an attempt to change\nthe present system into a tax levied on the tree itself, on a plane\nsimilar to the one above proposed; more particularly by doing it in\na temporary manner, and rendering it completely subservient to the\ncorrections subsequent experience might suggest in this particular.",
        "[Difficulty of estimating probable revenue.] The difficulty being,\nin this manner, overcome, with regard to the prudent determination\nof the rate at which the proprietor of the bonga plantations ought\nto contribute, let us now proceed to estimate, by approximation, the\nannual sum that would thus be obtained. As, however, this operation\nis unfortunately complicated, and in great measure depends on the\nprevious knowledge of the total number of trees liable to the tax\nproposed, details with which we are at not present prepared, it is\nimpossible to come at any very accurate results. All that can be done\nis to endeavor to demonstrate, in general terms, the great increase\nthe revenue would experience by the adoption of the new plan, and\nthe real advantage resulting from it to the contributors themselves,\nall which may be easily deduced from the following calculation.",
        "Let us, in the first instance, suppose that the consumers of buyo,\nin the whole of the Islands, do not exceed one million of persons,\nand that each one makes use of three bongas per day, this consumption,\nat the end of the year, would then amount to 1,095,000,000 nuts. We\nwill next divide this sum by two hundred, at which the product of each\ntree, one with another, is rated, and the result will be 5,475,000\ntrees. [Greater, however, than at present.] This number being taxed\nat the rate of one-fourth real, would leave the sum of $171,093.75\nand deducting therefrom the $25,000 yielded by this branch under its\npresent establishment, together with $5,132 equal to three per cent\npaid to the district magistrates for the charges of collection, we\nshould still have an annual increase in favor of the, treasury equal\nto $140,961.75.",
        "It might perhaps be objected that, in this case, the proprietor,\ninstead of receiving, as before two and one-half reals for every\nthousand bongas, would have to disburse one and one-fourth reals in\nthe mere act of paying one-fourth real for each tree; a circumstance\nwhich, at first sight, seems to produce a difference not of one and\none-fourth, but of three and one-fourth reals per thousand against\nhim; though in reality far from this being the case, if we take into\nconsideration the deficiencies the sworn receiver usually lays to\nhis charge, the fruit he rejects, owing to its being green or rotten,\nand the many and expensive grievances he is exposed to in his capacity\nof grower; it will be seen that his disbursements under these heads\nfrequently exceed the amount he in fact has to receive. [Tax only a\nsurcharge ultimately paid by consumer.] If, in addition to this, we\nbear in mind that, on condition of seeing himself free from guards\nand a variety of insupportable restrictions, constituting the very\nessence of a monopoly, he would in all probability gladly pay much\nmore than the tax in question, all the doubts arising on this point\nwill entirely disappear. Finally, considered in its true light, we\nshall not find in the measure above described anything more than a\nvery trifling discount required of the proprietor from the price at\nwhich he sells his bonga, and which, as already noticed, ultimately\nfalls on the consumer alone.",
        "[Estimate conservative.] The moderate estimate I have just formed ought\nto inspire the more confidence from its being well known that the use\nof the buyo is general among the inhabitants of these Islands. The\ncalculation, as it now stands, rests only on one million consumers,\nfor each of whom I have only put down three bongas per day, whereas\nit is customary to use much more; nor have I taken into account the\ninfinite number of nuts wasted after being converted into the buyo,\na fact equally well known. Indeed, as the object proposed was no\nother than to prove the main part of my assertions, and I trust this\nis satisfactorily done, I have not deemed it necessary to include\nin the above calculation a greater number of minute circumstances,\nnor attempt to deduce more favorable results, which, with the scope\nbefore me, I was most assuredly warranted in doing.",
        "[Advantages.] In a word, from the concurrence of the facts and\nreasons above adduced, the following propositions may, without any\ndifficulty, be laid down. First, that the increase of revenue produced\nby the reform in question, would in all probability exceed $150,000\nper annum; secondly, that the Filipinos would soon comprehend, and\ngladly consent to a change of this kind in the mode of contributing\nof which the advantages would be apparent; thirdly, that the persons\nemployed in the old establishment, might, with greater public utility,\nbe applied to other purposes; and lastly, that the civil magistrates\nwould not be harassed with so many strifes and lawsuits, and so many\nmelancholy victims of the monopoly, and its officers would cease to\ndrag a wretched existence in the prisons and places of hard labor in\nthese Islands.",
        "[Cockpit licenses.] The cock-pit branch of the revenue is hired out\nby the government, and the license is separately set up at auction\nfor the respective provinces. Its nature and regulations are so\nwell known that they do not require a particular description, the\ngeneral obligations of the contractors being the same as those in New\nSpain. Perhaps the only difference observed in this public exhibition\nin the Philippine Islands consists in its greater simplicity, owing to\nits being frequented only by the natives, the whites who are present\nat this kind of diversion being very few, or indeed none.",
        "[Inconsiderable income.] The cock-pits are open two days in the week,\nand the lessees of them receive half a real from every person who\nenters, besides the extra price they charge those who occupy the best\nseats, the owners of the fighting cocks, for the spurs, stalls for the\nsale of buyo, refreshments, etc. Notwithstanding all this, and although\ncockfighting is so general and favorite an amusement among these people\n(the rooster may justly be considered as the distinctive emblem of\nthe Filipino) the annual proceeds of this branch are inconsiderable;\nalthough it must be acknowledged that it has greatly increased since\nthe year 1780, when it appears the license was let at auction for\nonly about $14,000 owing, no doubt, to the exclusive privilege of\nthe contractors not having been extended to the provinces, as was\nafterwards gradually done.",
        "[Provincial cockpit revenue.] The total sum paid to the government by\nthe renters of this branch, according to the auction returns in 1810,\namounted to $40,141 in the following order for the provinces:",
        "    Tondo           $18,501\n    Cavite            2,225\n    La Laguna         2,005\n    Pampanga          3,000\n    Bulacan           6,900\n    Batangas          2,000\n    Pangasinan        1,200\n    Bataan            1,050\n    Iloilo            1,600\n    Ilocos              600\n    Tayabas             400\n    Cebu                360\n    Albay               300\n    Total           $40,141",
        "[Possibilities of increase.] The causes, to which the increase\nthat has taken place within the last twenty-five or thirty years is\nchiefly to be attributed, have already been pointed out, and for this\nreason it would appear that, by adopting the same plan with regard to\nthe fourteen remaining provinces, of which this captaincy-general\nis composed, hitherto free from the imposition of this tax, an\naugmentation might be expected, proportionate to the population,\ntheir circumstances, and the greater or lesser taste for cock-fights\nprevailing among their respective inhabitants. At the commencement, no\ndoubt, the rentals would be low, and, of course, the prices at which\nthe licenses were let out, would be equally so; but the experience\nand profits derivable from this kind of enterprises would not fail\nsoon to excite the competition of contractors, and in this way add\nto the revenue of the government. This is so obvious that I cannot\nhelp suspecting attempts have, at some period or other, been made\nto introduce the establishment of this privilege, in some of the\nprovinces alluded to; at the same time I am persuaded that, owing\nto the affair not having been viewed in its proper light, seeking\non the contrary to obtain an immediate and disproportionate result,\nthe authorities have been too soon disheartened and given up the\nproject without a fair trial. All towns and districts murmur, and,\nat first object, to taxes, however light they may be; but, at length,\nif they be not excessive, the people become reconciled to them. The\none here proposed is neither of this character, nor can it be deemed\nodious on account of its novelty. The natives are well aware that\ntheir brethren in the other provinces are subject to it, and that\nin this nothing more is done than rendering the system uniform. I,\ntherefore, see no reason why the establishment of this branch of\nrevenue should not be extended to all the points of the Islands. At\nthe commencement, let it produce what it may, since constancy and\ntime will bring things to the same general level.",
        "[Indian tributes.] The too great condescension and mistaken humanity\nof the government on the one hand, and the fraud and selfishness\nof the provincial sub-delegates or collectors, on the other, have\nconcurred to change a contribution, the most simple, into one of the\nmost complicated branches of public administration. The first cause\nhas been owing to a too general acquiescence to receive the amount\nof tributes in the produce peculiar to each province, instead of\nmoney; and the second, because as the above officers are the persons\nintrusted with the collection, whenever the sale has held out to\nthem any advantage, they have been in the habit of appropriating the\nseveral articles to themselves, without allowing any benefit to the\ntreasury. If the prospective sales of the produce appear unfavorable,\nit is then forwarded on to the king’s store in Manila, surcharged with\nfreights, exposed to many risks, and the value greatly diminished\nby waste and many other causes. No order or regularity being thus\nobserved in this respect, and the sale of the produce transmitted to\nthe king’s stores being regulated by the greater or lesser abundance in\nthe general market, and a considerable stock besides left remaining,\nfrom one year to another, and eventually spoiled, it is impossible\nto form any exact estimate of this branch. If to these complicated\nmatters we add the radical vices arising out of the infidelity of the\nheads of clans (cabezas de barangay), the difficulty of ascertaining\nthe defects of the returns made out by them, the variations annually\noccurring in the number of those exempted either through age or other\nlegal motives, and above all, the frequently inevitable tardiness with\nwhich the district magistrates send in their respective accounts,\nit will be readily acknowledged, that no department requires more\nzeal in its administration, and no one is more susceptible of all\nkinds of frauds, or attended with more difficulties.",
        "[A conservative estimate.] In this state of uncertainty, with regard\nto this particular branch, I have guided myself by the last general\nreturn of tributes, made out in the accountant-general’s office,\non the best and most recent data, and calculating indistinctly the\nwhole value in money, I have deemed it proper afterwards to make a\nmoderate deduction, on account of the differences above stated, and\narising out of the collection of the tributes in kind, the expenses of\nconveyance, shipwrecks, averages, and other causes already enumerated.",
        "[Fixed charges.] In conformity to this calculation, the total\nproceeds of this branch of revenue amount to $505,215 from which\nsum are deducted, in the primitive stages of the accounts, the\namount of ecclesiastical stipends, the pay of the troops under\nthe immediate orders of the chief district magistrates in their\nquality of war-captains, together with all other extraordinary\nexpenses incurred in the provinces by orders of the government, the\nremainder being afterwards forwarded to the king’s treasury. It ought,\nhowever, to be observed, that the above aggregated sum is more or less\nliable to deficiencies, according to the greater or lesser degree of\npunctuality on the part of the sub-collectors in making up accounts,\nand the solidity of their respective sureties; the failure of this\nkind experienced by the revenue being so frequent, that, according to\nthe returns of the accountant-general, those which occurred between\nthe years 1762 and 1809, were no less than $215,765 notwithstanding\nthe great precautions at all times taken to prevent such considerable\ninjuries, by every means compatible with the precarious tenure of\nproperty possessed by both principals and sureties in this country. All\nthe above circumstances being therefore taken into due consideration,\nand the ordinary and extraordinary discounts made from the total amount\nof tributes, the real sum remaining, or the net annual proceeds of\nthe above branch, have usually not been rated at more than $190,000\nand $200,000; a sum respectively extremely small, and which possibly\nmight be doubled, without the necessity of recurring to any other\nmeasure than a standing order for the collecting of the tributes in\nmoney, as by this means the variety of expenses and complications above\nenumerated, would be avoided, and the king’s revenue no longer exposed\nto any other deficiencies than those arising out of the insolvency\nof the sub-collectors and their sureties, or casual risks, and the\ntrifling charges paid for the conveyance of the money. If in opposition\nto this it should be alleged that it would be advisable to except some\nof the provinces from this general rule, owing to the advantages the\ngovernment might derive from certain tributes being paid in kind,\nI do not hesitate to answer that I see no reason whatever why this\nshould be done, because, if, for example, any quality of rigging\nor sail cloth is annually required, it would be easy to obtain it\neither by early contracts, or by laying in the articles at the current\nmarket price. Indeed, all supplies which do not rest on this footing,\nwould be to defraud the natives of the fruits of his industry, and in\nthe final result this would be the same as requiring of him double or\ntriple tribute, contrary to the spirit of the law, which unfortunately\nis too frequently the case under the existing system.",
        "[Preferability of tribute in money.] Considering this affair in\nanother point of view, it would be easy for me to demonstrate, if it\nwere necessary, the mistaken idea that the native is benefited by\nreceiving in kind the amount of the tribute he has to pay, at the\nlow prices marked in the tariff used as a standard, by showing the\nextortions and brokerage, if I may so term it, to which the practice\ngives rise on the part of the district collectors. It will, however,\nsuffice to call the attention of my readers to the smallness of\nthe sum constituting the ordinary tribute, when reduced to money,\nin order for them to be convinced that it would be superfluous,\nas well as hazardous, to attempt to point out how this branch might\nbe rendered more productive to the state and at the same time less\nburdensome to the contributors, more particularly when the rate\nassessed does not exceed ten reals per year, a sum so small, that\ngenerally speaking, no family can be found unable to hoard it up, if\nthey have any inclination so to do. The prevailing error, however, in\nthis respect, I am confident arises out of a principle very different\nfrom the one to which it is usually attributed. The tributary native\nis, in fact, disposed to pay the quota assigned to him into the hands\nof the chief of his clan, in money, in preference to kind; because,\nindependent of the small value at which the articles in kind are\nrated in the tariff, he is then exposed to no expenses, as he now is\nfor the conveyance of his produce and effects; nor is he liable to so\nmany accidents. But as the chief of each clan has to deliver in his\nforty or fifty tributes to the head magistrate, who is answerable for\nthose of the whole province, it is natural for him to endeavor to make\nhis corresponding payments in some equivalent affording him a profit;\nat the same time the provincial magistrate, speculating on a larger\nscale, on the produce arising out of his jurisdiction, seeks to obtain\nfrom the government a profitable commutation in kind for that which\nthe original contributor would have preferred paying in money. In\norder the better to attain his purpose, he asserts, as a pretext,\nthe impossibility of collecting in the tribute under another form,\nalleging, moreover, the relief the native derives from this mode,\nwhereas, if only duly examined, such a pretence is founded on the\navarice, rather than the humanity of the magistrate.",
        "Leaving to one side the defects attributable to the present mode\nof collection, and considering the tribute as it is in itself, the\nattentive observer must confess, that in no part of our Indies is\nthis more moderate; and, indeed, it is evident that the laws generally\nrelating to the natives of these Islands seem to distinguish them with\na decided predilection above those of the various sections of America.",
        "[Items in tribute.] The tribute in its origin was only eight reals\nper family; but the necessity of providing for the increased expenses\nof the government gave rise to this rate being afterwards raised\nto ten. The Sangley mestizos pay double tribute, and the Sangleys\ncontribute at the rate of $6 per head. Besides this, all pay a yearly\nsum, applicable to the funds belonging to the community, and the above\ntwo casts pay three reals more, as a church rate, and under the name\nof the Sanctuary, the whole being in the following form:",
        "Entire Native Tribute       Tribute of Mestizos     Sangleys",

        "The males commence paying tribute at twenty years of age and\nthe females at twenty-five, if before they have not entered the\nmatrimonial state, and in both the obligation ceases at the age of\nsixty. The chiefs of clans, or cabezas de barangay and their eldest\nsons, or in default of children, the person adopted in their stead,\nthat is, an entire tribute and a half, are exempt from this tax, as\na remuneration for the trouble and responsibility they may have in\ncollecting in the forty or fifty tributes, of which their respective\nclans are composed. Besides these there are various other classes of\nexempted persons, such as the soldiers who have served a certain number\nof years, those who have distinguished themselves in any particular\nmanner in the improvement of industry or agriculture, and others who\nhave received special certificates, on just and equitable grounds. In\nsumming up the total number of exempted persons, on an average in\nthe whole of the provinces, they will be found in the proportion of\nfifty to every thousand entire tributes.",
        "[Chinese tax.] The head-tax of the Sangleys has usually been\nattended with so many difficulties in its collection, owing to the\nfacilities with which they absent or secrete themselves, and the\nmany stratagems this cunning and artful race employ to elude the\nvigilance of the commissioners, that the government has at length\nfound itself compelled to let out this branch, as was done in 1809,\nwhen it was disposed of in the name of one of them for the moderate\nsum of $30,000; notwithstanding it is a generally received opinion,\nthat the number of this description of Chinese, constantly residing\nin the Islands, is above 7,000, which, at the rate of $6 per head,\nwould raise this proportion of the tax as high as $42,000.",
        "[Community funds.] The Community funds belonging to each town, have,\nin conformity to the regulations under which they are administered,\na special, or I might say, local application; but collected together\ninto one stock, as is now the case, and directly administered by the\ngovernment, they produce a more general utility. The head town of\nthe province A, for example, requires to rebuild the public prison\nor town-hall, and its own private funds are not sufficient to defray\nthe expenses of the work in question. In this case, therefore, the\ngovernment gives orders for the other dependent towns to make up the\ndeficiency by taking their proportions from their respective coffers,\nas all have an equal interest in the proposed object being carried\ninto effect. The king’s officers, in consequence thereof, draw the\ncorresponding sums from these funds, the whole of which is under their\nimmediate superintendence. And in order that the surplus of this stock\nmay not stand still, but obtain every possible increase in a country\nwhere the premium for money is excessive, when let out at a maritime\nrisk, it is ordered that some part shall be appropriated in this way,\nand on the same terms as those observed by the administrators of the\ncharity funds belonging to the Misericordia (Charity) establishment,\nand the third order of St. Francis, which is another of the great\nadvantages of assembling this class of property.",
        "In consequence of this judicious regulation, and the success with\nwhich this measure has hitherto been attended, the Community fund\nhas gone on increasing in such a way that, notwithstanding the sums\ndrawn from it for the purpose of constructing causeways, bridges,\nand other municipal objects, at the commencement of 1810, the stock\nin hand amounted to no less than $200,000; and it is natural to\nsuppose when the outstanding premiums due shall have been paid in,\na considerable augmentation will take place. This branch, although\nnot exactly comprehended in those which constitute the revenue of the\ngovernment, has so obvious an analogy with that of tributes, that I\nhave not deemed it any essential deviation from the order and method\nI have hitherto observed in this work, to introduce it in this place,\nas in itself it did not deserve to be classed under a distinct head.",
        "[Tribute burdensome.] Notwithstanding the truth of what has been\nsaid with regard to the moderate rate of the tribute imposed on the\nnative of the Philippine Islands, it would be extremely desirable if\nhe could be altogether exonerated from a charge which he bears with\ngreat repugnance, by some other substitute being adopted, indirectly\nproducing an equivalent compensation. In the first place, because the\njust motives of complaint would cease, caused not only by the tribute,\nbut also the manner of its collection; and an end would then be put\nto those intrigues and extortions the district magistrates commit,\nunder the title of zealous collectors of the king’s revenue, and the\npower of a multitude of subaltern tyrants, comprehended under the\ndenomination of chiefs of native clans (cabezas de barangay) would\nthen also fall to the ground; a power which, if now employed for the\npurpose of oppressing and trampling on the liberties of inferiors,\nmight some day or other be converted into an instrument dangerous\nand subversive of our preponderance in the country. In the second\nplace, if, among all the civilized nations a head-tax (poll-tax)\nis in itself odious, it must incontestably be much more so among\nthose whose unlettered state, far from allowing them to know that\nthe social order requires a certain class of sacrifices for its\nbetter preservation, makes them attribute exactions of this kind\nto an abuse of superiority. Hence are they led to consider these\nrestraints as the symbols of their own slavery and degradation, as\nin fact the natives in these Islands have ample reasons for doing,\nwhen the legal exemption of the whites is considered, without any\nother apparent reason than the difference in color. Independent of\nthis, the substitute above alluded to would be extremely expedient,\ninasmuch as it would greatly simplify the plan of administration,\nthe accountant’s department would be freed from the most painful\npart of its labors, and the district magistrates and sub-collectors\nwould not so frequently be entangled in their accounts, and exposed\nto expensive and interminable lawsuits, as now so often happens.",
        "[Possible Revenue substitutes.] The difficulty, however, of\nfinding out this compensation or substitute is a matter of some\nconsideration. On the one hand, if it was attempted to distribute\nthe proceeds arising out of the tributes on other branches, such as\ntobacco, native wine, bonga, and custom house, it would, at first\nsight, appear possible, through the medium of an almost invisible\naugmentation in the respective sale prices and in the king’s duties,\nthat this important object might easily be attained; but, on the\nother, it might be apprehended that the additional value put on\nthe articles above-mentioned, would produce in their consumption\na diminution equal to the difference in prices, in which cases no\nadvantage would be gained. The practicability of the operation, in my\nopinion, depends on the proportion in which the means of obtaining the\narticles in question respectively stand with the probability of their\nbeing consumed. I will explain myself. If, for example, the annual\nstock of tobacco laid in should be insufficient to meet the wants of\nthe consumers, as constantly occurs, it is clear that this article,\nwhen monopolized, will bear a small augmentation of price, not only\nwithout any inconvenience or risk, but with the moral certainty of\nobtaining a positive increase of revenue, the necessary effect of\nthe total consumption of the tobacco laid in and sold. But as this\ndoes not happen with the branch of native wines, of which the stock\nusually exceeds the demand, and as the bonga also is not susceptible\nof this improvement, owing to the small place it occupies among the\nother resources of the revenue, no other means are left than to add to\nthe duties of export on silver, and of import on foreign merchandise,\na percentage equivalent to the deficiency not laid on tobacco, unless\nit should be deemed more advisable to levy a sumptuary contribution on\ncoaches, horses and servants, and especially on all kinds of edifices\nand houses built of stone and mortar, situated both within and without\nthe capital.",
        "[Objection to tribute-paying.] However this may be, whatever the king\nloses in revenue by the abolition of the native tributes, no doubt,\ncould be made up by an appeal to other ways and means. It is well-known\nthat many of the Indian tribes refuse to become subjects of the crown\nand object to enter into general society on account of the odious\nidea they have formed of paying tribute; or, as they understand it,\nthe obligation of giving something for nothing, notwithstanding those\nwho voluntarily submit themselves to our laws, are exempt from tribute,\nand this charge falls only on their descendants. But of this they must\neither be ignorant, or they regret depriving their posterity of that\nindependence in which they themselves have been brought up, and thus\ntransmit to them slavery as an inheritance. As soon, therefore, as a\ngeneral exemption of this kind, without distinction of casts, should\nbe made public, the natives would quit their fastnesses and secluded\nplaces, and satisfied with the security offered to them, would be\nseen coming down to the plains in search of conveniences of civilized\nlife, and all gradually would be reduced to Christianity. Hence\nthe increase of productions and their consumption, as well as\nthe extension of agriculture, industry and internal commerce. The\ndiminution of smuggling tobacco would soon follow, progress would be\nmade in the knowledge of the mines and natural riches of the country,\nand financially, greater facilities would present themselves in\ngradually carrying into effect its entire conquest and civilization.",
        "Advantages of such great and extraordinary importance deserve to\nbe seriously weighed, and to this valuable department of public\nadministration the early attention of those in authority ought to\nbe called. Let due inquiries be made, and soon shall we discover\nthe substantial benefits which would be derived to the treasury\nfrom the adoption of this measure, as popular as it is just, and\nalso conformable to the liberal spirit of the times. In support of\nthe preceding arguments, it ought further to be observed, that when\nall the branches constituting the king’s revenue are well organized,\nbrought to their most productive state, and the public debt contracted\nunder unforeseen exigencies paid off, as long as present circumstances\ndo not vary, an annual surplus of revenue, equal to more than $500,000,\nwill be left; and as the proceeds of the particular branch of tributes\ndo not amount to this sum, it is evident their abolition may take\nplace, not only without any derangement or onerous consequences to the\nadministration, but even without any deficiency being experienced, or\nany necessity to recur to the treasury of New Spain for extraordinary\naid. These reasons acquire still greater force when it is remembered\nthat, as things now are, all the branches of public revenue are\nin a progressively improving condition, and as the whole are still\nsusceptible of a much more productive organization, the annual surplus\nof receipts will rapidly become greater, and consequently also the\nnecessity will diminish of continuing to burden this portion of His\nMajesty’s dominions with contributions in order to meet the expenses\nof their defence and preservation.",
        "Finally, well convinced of the advantageous results which, in\nevery sense, would emanate from the revision and reforms proposed,\nI abstain from offering, in support of my arguments, a variety of\nother reflections which occur to me, not to be too diffuse on this\nsubject; trusting that the hints I have already thrown out will be\nmore than sufficient to excite an interest and promote a thorough and\nimpartial investigation of concerns, highly important to the future\nwelfare and security of this colony.",
        "[Subaltern branches.] Besides the six preceding branches which\nconstitute the chief mass of the public revenue in these islands, there\nare several smaller ones of less consideration and amount; some having\na direct application to the general expenses of the local government,\nand the others, intended as remittances to Spain; a distinction of\nlittle import and scarcely deserving of notice, since the object of the\npresent sketch is to convey information on a large scale respecting\nthe King’s revenue in these Islands. As some of them, however, yield\nproceeds more regular than the others, I have classed together the\nreceipts of the Pope’s Bulls, or “Bulas de Cruzada,” playing-cards,\ntithes, stamps and gunpowder, under the head of Subaltern Branches,\nwith regard to the rest, to the general statement already quoted.",
        "In conformity to the returns with which I have been favored from\nthe public offices, these five branches produced, in the year 1809,\n$45,090.75 in the following proportions:",
        "                    Sales.      Expenses.   Net Proceeds.\n    Pope’s bulls    $15,360.75  $4,422.25   $10,938.50\n    Playing cards    11,539.125    932.625   10,606.50\n    Tithes           12,493.00        ––   12,493.00\n    Stamps            4,467.50     321.50     4,146.00\n    Gunpowder         7,307.625    401.125    6,905.375\n                           ––       ––         ––\n                    $51,168.125 $6,077.75   $45,090.375",
        "[Tithes.] The scanty proceeds of the tithes will naturally appear\nremarkable; but it ought to be remembered that, besides the ordinary\ntribute, the natives pay half a real under this denomination,\nwithout any distinction of person, or any reference whatever to their\nrespective means, the total amount of which is already added to the\ntributes, and for this reason not repeated in this place. In addition\nalso no tithes are levied, except on lands belonging to Spaniards,\nchurches, regular clergy, ecclesiastical corporations, etc., and even\nthen the articles of rice, wheat, pulse indigo and sugar, are alone\nliable. The above branches are all in charge of administrators,\nand from this plan it certainly would be advisable to separate\nthe tithes and farm them out at public auction, as was proposed\nby the king’s officers of the treasury, in their report on this,\nas well as other points, concerning the revenue, and dated October\n24, 1792. From the net proceeds of the gunpowder the expenses of its\nmanufacture, confided to the commandant of artillery, ought seemingly\nto be deducted; but, as they cannot be ascertained with any degree of\ncertainty, and as besides they are comprehended in the general expenses\nof that department, a separate deduction may be dispensed with.",
        "[Disbursements and general expenses.] In order to form a correct idea\nof the annual amount of the expenditure incurred by the administration\nand defence of the Philippine Islands, it is not necessary in this\nplace to distinguish each item, separately; or to enumerate them\nwith their respective sums or particular denominations. Some general\nobservations on this subject ought, nevertheless, to be made, with a\nview to point out the reforms of which this important department of\nthe public revenue is susceptible.",
        "In the part relating to the interior administration or government,\nample room is certainly left for that kind of economy arising out of\nthe adoption of a general system, little complicated; but it is besides\nindispensably necessary that, at the same time the work is simplifed\nand useless hands dismissed, the salaries of those who remain should\nbe proportionally increased, in order to stimulate them in the due\nperformance of their duties. It might also be found advisable to\ncreate a small number of officers of a superior order, who would\nbe enabled to co-operate in the collection of the king’s revenue,\nand the encouragement of agriculture, commerce and navigation,\nin their respective departments. The additional charges in this\nrespect cannot be of any great consequence; although, in reality,\nby the receipts increasing through the impulse of an administrative\norder more perfect, and the expenses being always the same, the main\nobject, so anxiously sought for in another way, would be thus attained.",
        "[Defence expenses.] The reverse, however, happens with regard\nto the expenses of defence, as I have called them, the better to\ndistinguish them from those purely relating to the interior police\nor administration. Every sacrifice, most assuredly, ought to appear\nsmall, when the object is to preserve a country from falling into the\nhands of an enemy, and it ought not to excite surprise, if, during the\ncourse of the last fifteen years, several millions of dollars have been\nexpended in the Philippines, in order to shield them from so dreadful\na misfortune. But the late memorable revolution in the Peninsula has\ngiven rise to so great a change in our political relations, and it\nis extremely improbable that these Islands will be again exposed to\nthe same danger and alarm, that the government may now, without any\napparent risk, dispense with a considerable part of the preparations\nof defence, at one time deemed indispensably necessary. A colony that\nhas no other strong place to garrison than its capital, and on the\nloyalty of whose inhabitants there are sufficient motives to rely,\nought, in my opinion, to be considered as adequately provided against\nall ordinary occurrences in time of peace, with the 4,000 regulars,\nmore or less, of all arms, the usual military establishment. In case\nany suspicions should arise of an early rupture with the only power\nwhose forces can inspire the governors of these Islands with any kind\nof apprehensions, means will not be wanting to an active and provident\nminister, of giving proper advice, so as to allow sufficient time for\nthe assembling of the battalions of provincial militia and all the\nother necessary preparations of defence, before the enemy is in an\nattitude to effect an invasion of a country so far distant from his\nown possessions on the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel. Consequently,\nby disbanding the corps of provincial infantry, cavalry and artillery,\nwhich continue uselessly to be kept on foot, an annual saving of\nfrom $220,000 to $250,000 would take place, an amount too great to\nbe expended unless imperiously called for by the evident dread of a\npremeditated attack from an hostile quarter.",
        "[Shipping reform.] The navy is another of the departments in which\nreforms may be introduced, of no small moment to the treasury. Of\ncourse by the government merely dispensing with the policy of keeping\nin readiness two large ships to convey to Acapulco the cargos, for\nwhich the Manila merchants enjoy an annual licence, and leaving to\nthe latter the full liberty of following up their speculations on\ntheir own account and risk, in vessels of their own, individually or\nwith joint stock, a saving would result in favor of the crown equal to\n$140,000 to $150,000 per annum, and without preventing the receipt in\nAcapulco of the customary duties of $160,000 or $166,000 corresponding\nto the said licenses. This will evidently be the case, because as\nlong as the large disposal of funds of the charitable institutions\nare employed in maritime risks, and the private property of others\nis besides added to them, the amount of the operations undertaken by\nthe merchants of the Philippines to New Spain, when divested of all\nrestraint, will always exceed $500,000 per annum. Nor is there now\nany further occasion for the government to continue granting this\nspecies of gratuitous tutelage to a body of men possessed of ample\nmeans to manage their own affairs, and who demand the same degree of\nfreedom, and only seek a protection similar to that enjoyed by their\nfellow-countrymen in other parts of the king’s dominions.",
        "[Galleon graft.] In case the above reform should be adopted, it might\nbe deemed requisite for the government to undertake the payment of some\nof the charges under the existing order of things, defrayed out of the\nfreights to which the merchandise shipped in the Acapulco traders is\nliable; because, calculating the freight at the usual rate of $200 for\neach three bales, or the amount of one ticket, out of the one thousand\nconstituting the entire cargo, and of which one-half, or $100,000 more\nor less, is appropriated to the ecclesiastical chapter, municipality,\nofficers of the regular army (excluding captains and the other higher\nranks) and the widows of Spaniards, who in this case would be losers,\nindependent of the remaining $100,000 or 500 tickets distributed\namong the 200 persons having a right to ship to Acapulco, it would, at\nfirst sight, appear reasonable for the treasury to indemnify the above\ndescription of persons by a compensation equivalent to the privation\nthey experience through the new arrangement of the government. But\nas the practice of abuses constitutes no law, and what is given\nthrough favor is different to that which is required by justice,\nthere are no reasons whatever why the treasury should be bound to\nsupport the widows of private persons, from the mere circumstance of\ntheir deceased husbands having been Spaniards; more particularly if\nit is considered that, far from having acquired any special merit\nduring their lifetime, most of them voluntarily left their native\ncountry for the purpose of increasing their fortunes, and others were\nbanished from it, owing to their bad conduct. Neither can it be said\nthat the municipality have a legal right, in the case before stated,\nto receive any equivalent for the value of their respective annual\ntickets, which, when disposed of, usually amount to about $20,000 in\nthe first place, because it is well-known that the eleven aldermen’s\nseats, of which that body is composed, seats which can either be\nsold or resigned, originally did not cost as much as $50,000 and\nclearly the principal invested is out of all kind of proportion with\nthe enormous premium or income claimed. In the second place, although\nthe above municipal situations were originally purchased with a view\nto obtain some advantages, these formerly were very different to what\nthey are at present, when the great increase of shippers to Acapulco,\nor in more plain terms, of purchase of tickets competing to obtain\nthem, has given to these permits a value more than triple to that\nthey possessed thirty years ago.",
        "[Indemnifying the aldermen.] In order, therefore, to do away with\nall motives of doubt and dispute, as well as for many other reasons\nof public utility, the best plan, in my opinion, would be, to return\nto each alderman his money, and the present municipal constitution\nbeing dissolved, the number of members might be reduced to four, with\ntheir corresponding registrar, and like the two ordinary “alcaldes,\"\nelected every year without any other reward than the honor of presiding\nover and representing their fellow-citizens. Under this supposition,\nthe only classes entitled to compensation, strictly speaking,\nwould be the ecclesiastical chapter and the subaltern officers,\nwhose respective pay and appointment are not in fact sufficient\nfor the decency and expenses of their rank in society. Of course it\nwould then be necessary to grant them more adequate allowances, but,\naccording to reasonable calculations, the sum total annually required\nwould not exceed $30,000; consequently, the reform projected with\nregard to the Acapulco ships would still eventually produce to the\ntreasury a saving of from $60,000 to $70,000 in the first year of\nits adoption, and of $110,000 to $120,000 in every succeeding one.",
        "[The navy.] It is, on the other hand, undeniable that, if the royal\nnavy and cruising vessels, or those belonging to the Islands and\nunder the immediate orders of the captain-general, were united into\none department, and placed under one head, considerable economy\nwould ensue, and all motives of discord and emulation be moreover\nremoved. Such would be the case if the change was attended with no\nother cirumstances than the consequent diminution of commanders,\nsubaltern officers, and clerks; but it would be also proper to unite\nthe arsenals, and adopt a more general uniformity in the operations and\ndependences of this part of the public services. It is equally certain\nthat, during peaceful times, the two schooners and sixty gunboats,\nconstituting the number of the above-mentioned cruising vessels, would\nbe in great measure useless; whilst in case of a rupture, they are not\nsufficient to protect the trade of these Islands from the attacks of an\nenemy, notwithstanding they now cost the government considerable sums\nin repairs, etc., in order to keep them fit for service. The government\nought therefore to guard against this waste of public money, without,\nhowever, neglecting the defence of the Islands, objects which, in my\nopinion, might easily be reconciled. Intelligent persons have judged\nthat by reducing the naval forces to two frigates, two schooners,\nand about a dozen gunboats, the essential wants of the colony would be\nduly answered, in ordinary times; and some of the vessels might then\nbe destined to pursue hydrographical labors in the Archipelago, which,\nunfortunately, are in a most backward state, whilst others could be\nsent on their periodical cruises against the Moros. By this means, at\nleast, the navy department would be greatly simplified, and cease to be\neternally burdensome to the government. With regard to the superfluous\ngunboats, it would be expedient to distribute them gratuitously among\nthe marine provinces and Bisayan Islands, on the only condition of\ntheir being always kept fit for service; as, in one sense, the great\nexpenses of maintaining them would be thus saved by the treasury, and,\nanother, the inhabitants of those portions of the coast would be in\npossession of means sufficiently powerful to repel the aggressions of\nthe Moros, who commit great ravages on their settlements. Finally,\nif besides the reforms of which the army and navy are susceptible,\nit is considered that the public works, such as prisons, schools,\nbridges, and causeways, so expensive in other countries, in the\nPhilippines are constructed by the natives on the most reasonable\nterms, out of the community funds; that there is no necessity to build\nfortifications, and maintain numerous garrisons; that the clergy, to\nwhose zeal and powerful influence the preservation of these Islands\nis chiefly due, do not cost the treasury annually above $200,000 and\nthat the geographical situation of the colony in great measure shields\nit from the attacks of external enemies, it will readily be confessed,\nthat a wise and firm government might undertake, without the dread of\nhaving to encounter any great obstacles, an administrative system,\nin a general point of view, infinitely more economical than the one\nhitherto followed; might be able to extirpate numerous abuses, and\nby calling forth the resources of the country gradually raise it to\na flourishing condition, and cause it hereafter to contribute largely\nto the other wants of the crown. Hence was it that the distinguished\nvoyager, La Pérouse (Chap. 15), contemplating these Islands with a\npolitical eye, did not hesitate to affirm “that a powerful nation,\npossessed of no other colonies than the Philippines, that should\nsucceed in establishing there a form of government best adapted to\ntheir advantageous circumstances, would justly disregard all the\nother European establishments in Africa and America.”",
        "[Objectionable office-holders.] In our colonies, appointments and\ncommand far from being sought as a means to obtain a good reputation,\nor as affording opportunities of contributing to public prosperity,\nare, it is too well known, only solicited with a view to amass\nwealth, and then retire for the purpose of enjoying it. Commercial\npursuits being besides attended with so many advantages that those\nonly decline following them who are divested of money and friends;\nwhilst the situation in the revenue are so few in number, compared\nwith the many candidates who solicit them, that they are consequently\nwell appointed, it follows that the excess left without occupation,\nbesides being considerable, is generally composed of needy persons, and\nnot the most suitable to exercise the delicate functions of collectors\nand magistrates in the provinces. From this class nevertheless the\nhost of officers are usually taken who, under the name of collectors,\nsurveyors and assessors of tributes, intervene in, or influence\nthe public administration. Owing to the variety and great number of\npersons emigrating to America, ample field, no doubt, is there left\nfor selection, by which means the viceroys may frequently meet with\npersons suitable and adequate to the above trusts, if prudent steps\nare only taken; but in this respect the case is very different in the\nPhilippines, where chance alone occasionally brings over a European\nSpaniard, unemployed or friendless. In these remote Islands, also,\nmore than in any other quarter, people seek to live in idleness, and,\nas much as possible, without working, or much trouble. As long as\nhopes are entertained of doing something in the Acapulco speculations,\nevery other pursuit is viewed with indifference, and the office of\ndistrict or provincial magistrate is only solicited when all other\nresources have failed, or as a remedy against want. As the applicants\nfor these situations are therefore not among the most select classes,\nit very frequently happens that they fall into extremely improper\nand unworthy hands.",
        "It is in fact common enough to see a hairdresser or a lackey converted\ninto a governor; a sailor or a deserter transformed into a district\nmagistrate, collector, or military commander of a populous province,\nwithout any other counsellor than his own crude understanding,\nor any other guide than his passion. Such a metamorphosis would\nexcite laughter in a comedy or farce; but, realized in the theatre\nof human life, it must give rise to sensations of a very different\nnature. Who is there that does not feel horror-struck, and tremble\nfor the innocent, when he sees a being of this kind transferred from\nthe yard-arm to the seat of justice, deciding, in the first instance,\non the honor, lives, and property of a hundred thousand persons, and\nhaughtily exacting the homage and incense of the spiritual ministers\nof the towns under his jurisdiction, as well as of the parish curates,\nrespectable for their acquirements and benevolence, and who, in their\nown native places, would possibly have rejected as a servant the very\nman whom in the Philippines they are compelled to court and obey as\na sovereign.",
        "In vain do the laws ordain that such offices shall not be given away to\nattendants on governors and members of the high court of justice, for\nunder pretext of the scarcity of Europeans experienced in the colony,\nmeans are found to elude the statute, by converting this plea into an\nexception in favor of this description of persons. By such important\noffices being filled in this manner, it is easy to conceive the various\nhardships to which many of the provinces and districts are exposed;\nnor can any amelioration be expected as long as this plan is persisted\nin and the excesses of the parties go without punishment.",
        "[Evils from officials in trade.] Independent, however, of the serious\ninjuries and great errors persons of the class above described cannot\nfail to commit in the exercise of their functions, purely judicial, the\nconsequences of their inordinate avarice are still more lamentable,\nand the tacit permission to satisfy it, granted to them by the\ngovernment under the specious title of a licence to trade. Hence may\nit be affirmed, that the first of the evils, and the one the native\ninmmediately feels, is occasioned by the very person the law has\ndestined for his relief and protection. In a word, he experiences\ninjuries from the civil magistrates presiding over the provinces,\nwho, at the same time, are the natural enemies of the inhabitants,\nand the real oppressors of their industry.",
        "It is a known and melancholy fact that, far from promoting the\nfelicity of the provinces intrusted to their care, the magistrates\nattend to nothing else but their own fortunes and personal interests;\nnor do they hesitate as to the means by which their object is to\nbe attained. Scarcely are they seated in the place of authority,\nwhen they become the chief consumers, purchasers, and exporters of\nevery thing produced and manufactured within the districts under\ntheir command, thus converting their licence to trade into a positive\nmonopoly. In all lucrative speculations the magistrate seeks to have\nthe largest share; in all his enterprises he calls in the forced aid\nof his subjects, and if he deigns to remunerate their labor, at most\nit is only on the same terms as if they had been working on account\nof the king. These unhappy people bring in their produce and crude\nmanufactures to the very person who, directly or indirectly, is to fix\nupon them an arbitrary value. To offer such and such a price for the\narticles is the same as to say, another bidding shall not be made. To\ninsinuate is to command–the native is not allowed to hesitate, he must\neither please the magistrate, or submit to his persecutions. Being\nbesides free from all competition in the prosecution of his traffic,\nsince he is frequently the only Spaniard resident in the province,\nthe magistrate therein acts with unbounded sway, without dread,\nand almost without risk of his tyranny ever being denounced to the\nsuperior tribunals.",
        "[Speculating in tributes.] In order, however, that a more correct\nidea may be formed of the iniquitous conduct of many of these public\nfunctionaries, it is necessary to lay open some part of their irregular\ndealings in the collection of the Indian tributes. It is well known\nthat the government, anxious to conciliate the interests of the\ntributary classes with those of the revenue, frequently commutes\nthe pecuniary capitation tax into an obligation to pay the amount in\nproduce or manufactures. A season comes when, owing to the failure\nof the crops, the productions have risen to an excessive price,\nand consequently infinitely above the ordinary rates affixed by law,\nwhich are generally the lowest, and the natives, unable to keep their\nbargains without considerable injury or endangering the subsistence\nof their numerous families, implore the favor of the magistrate,\npetitioning him to lay their calamitous situation before the superior\ngovernment, in order to have the payment of their tribute in kind\nremitted, and offering to pay it in money. This is the precise moment\nwhen, as his own profits depend on the misery of the province under\nhis command, he endeavors to misuse the accidental power with which he\nis invested. Hence it happens that, instead of acting as a beneficent\nmediator, and supporting the just solicitations of the natives, he at\nfirst disregards their petition, and then all at once transforming\nhimself into a zealous collector, issues his notifications, sends\nhis satellites into the very fields to seize on the produce, and in a\nmost inexorable manner insists on collecting till necessity compels\nhim to suspend the measure. The principal object being attained,\nthat is, having now become master of the gleanings and scanty crops\nof his bereft subjects, on a sudden his disposition changes, he is\nmoved to pity, and in the most pathetic language describes to the\ngovernment the ravages done to the plantations by the hurricanes,\nand the utter impossibility of collecting in the tributes that year in\nkind. On such a remonstrance he easily obtains permission to change the\nstanding order, and proceeding on to collect in some of the remaining\ntributes in money, merely to save appearance, with perfect impunity\nhe puts the finishing stroke to the wicked act he had commenced, by\napplying to himself all the produce his collectors had gathered in,\nand places to the credit of the treasury the total amount of the\ntributes, corresponding to his jurisdiction, in money.",
        "Supposing, for example, that this has happened in the province of\nAntique, where the payment of the capitation-tax generally takes place\nin the unhusked rice, rated at two reals per cavan, and, through the\neffects of a bad season, this article should rise as high as ten or\ntwelve reals. It is clear that the magistrate, by accounting for the\ntributes with the revenue office in money, and collecting them in kind\nat the rate fixed by law, would by the sales gain a profit of 400 or\n500 per cent; at the same time the native, by the mere circumstance\nof then paying in kind, would have paid the tribute corresponding to\nfive or six years in a single one, without, on that account, having\nfreed himself from the same charge in the following seasons.",
        "[No check on extortion.] When the extortionate acts as these are\npractised, to what lengths may it not be expected the other excesses\nand abuses of authority are carried? To the above it ought moreover\nto be added, that the provincial magistrates have no lieutenants,\nand are unprovided with any other auxiliaries in the administration\nof justice, except an accompanying witness and a native director;\nthat the scrutinies of their accounts, to which they formerly were\nsubject, are now abolished, and, in short, that they have no check\nupon them, or indeed any other persons to bear testimony to their\nirregularities, except the friendless and miserable victims of their\ndespotism and avarice.",
        "Notwithstanding, however, what is above stated, it sometimes happens\nthat a magistrate is to be met with, distinguished from the rest by\nhis prudence and good conduct; but this is a miracle, for by the very\ncircumstance of his being allowed to trade, he is placed in a situation\nto abuse the wide powers confided to him, and preferably to attend\nto his personal interests; in fact, if the principle is in itself\ndefective, it must naturally be expected the consequences will be\nequally baneful. The lamentable abuses here noticed are but too true,\nas well as many others passed over in silence; and the worst of all\nis, that there is no hope of remedying them thoroughly, unless the\npresent system of interior administration is altogether changed. In\nvain would it be to allege the possibility of removing the evil by the\ntimely and energetic interposition of the protector of the natives;\nfor although this office is in itself highly respectable, it cannot\nin any way reach the multitude of excesses committed, and much less\nprevent them; not only because the minister who exercises it resides\nin the city, where complaints are seldom brought in, unless they come\nthrough the channel of the parish curates; but also on account of the\ndifficulty of fully establishing the charges against the magistrates,\nin the way the natives are at present depressed by fear and threats, as\nwell as restrained by the sub-governors and other inferior officers of\njustice, who, being dependent upon, and holding their situations from\nthe magistrates, are interested in their monopolies and extortionate\nacts being kept from public view.",
        "[Less complaisant laws needed.] If, therefore, it is not possible\nentirely to eradicate the vices under which the interior administration\nof these Islands labors, owing to the difficulty of finding persons\npossessed of the necessary virtues and talents to govern, in an upright\nand judicious manner, let us at least prevent the evils out of the\ntoo great condescension of our own laws. In the infancy of colonies,\nit has been the maxim of all governments to encourage the emigration\nand settlement of inhabitants from the mother-country, without paying\nmuch attention to the means by which this was to be done. It was not to\nbe wondered at that, for reasons of state, defects were overlooked,–at\nsuch periods were even deemed necessary. Hence the relaxation in the\nlaws in favor of those who, quitting their native land, carried over\nwith them to strange countries their property and acquirements. Hence,\nno doubt, also are derived the full powers granted to those who took\nin charge the subjection and administration of the new provinces,\nin order that they might govern, and at the same time carry on their\ntraffic with the natives, notwithstanding the manifest incompatibility\nof the two occupations; or rather, the certainty that ought to have\nbeen foreseen that public duties would generally be postponed, when\nplaced in competition with private interests and the anxious desire\nof acquiring wealth.",
        "Subsequently that happened which was, in fact, to be dreaded, viz.,\nwhat at first was tolerated as a necessary evil, sanctioned by the\nlapse of time has at length become a legitimate right, or rather a\ncompensation for the supposed trouble attached to the fulfillment of\nthe duties of civil magistrates; whilst they, as already observed,\nthink of nothing but themselves, and undergo no other trouble or\ninconvenience than usually fall on the lot of any other private\nmerchant. In the Philippines, at least, many years having elapsed\nsince the natives peaceably submitted to the dominion of the king,\nevery motive has ceased that could formerly, and in a certain degree,\njustify the indulgence so much abused, at the same time that no\nplausible pretext whatever exists for its further continuation.",
        "Although hitherto the number of whites, compared to that of the\npeople of color, has not been great, as the whole of the provincial\nmagistracies, collectorships, and subaltern governments, do not exceed\ntwenty-seven, the scarcity of Spaniards ought not to be alleged as a\nsufficient reason; nor can it be doubted these situations might at any\ntime be properly filled, if the person on whom the choice should fall\nwere only certain of living with decency and in a suitable manner,\nwithout being carried away with the flattering hopes of withdrawing\nfrom office, with ten, twenty, and even as high as fifty thousand\ndollars of property, as has heretofore been the case, but satisfied\nwith a due and equivalent salary they might receive as a reward for\nthe public services they perform.",
        "I do not therefore see why the government should hesitate in resolving\nto put a stop to evils which the people of the Philippines have not\nceased to deplore from the time of the conquest, by proscribing, under\nthe most severe penalties, the power of trading, as now exercised\nby the provincial magistrates. The time is come when this struggle\nbetween duty and sordid interest ought to end, and reason, as well\nas enlightened policy, demand that in this respect our legislation\nshould be reformed, in order that the mace of justice, instead of\nbeing prostituted in search of lucre, may henceforwards be wholly\nemployed in the support of equity and the protection of society.",
        "[Urgence of reform.] The only objection which, at first sight, might\nbe started against the suggestions here thrown out is the increased\nexpense which would fall on the treasury, owing to the necessity of\nappropriating competent salaries for the interior magistrates under\nthe new order of things. Independent, however, of the fact that the\nrapid improvements the provinces must assume, in every point of view,\nwould superabundantly make up this trifling difference; yet supposing\nthe sacrifice were gratuitous, and even of some moment, it ought\nnot, on that account, to be omitted, since there is no public object\nmore important to the sovereign himself, than to make the necessary\nprovision for the decorum of the magistracy, the due administration\nof justice, and the maintenance of good order among his subjects.",
        "The position being established, that a number of whites more\nthan sufficient might be obtained, eligible and fit to perform\nthe duties of civil magistrates, which they would be induced to\nundertake, if adequate terms were only proposed, it would seem that\nno ill consequences might be expected from at once assimilating\nthe regulations of these provincial judicatures to those of the\ncorregimientos, or mayoralties of towns in Spain, or in making out an\nexpress statute, on a triple scale, for three classes of magistrates,\ngranting to them emoluments equivalent to the greater or lesser\nextent of the respective jurisdictions. As far as regards the pay, it\nought to be so arranged as to act as a sufficient stimulus to induce\nEuropean colonists to embrace this career, in a fixed and permanent\nway, which hitherto they have only resorted to as a five years’\nspeculation. Conformably to this suggestion, and owing to the lesser\nvalue attached to money in India, compared with Europe, on account of\nthe greater abundance of the necessaries of life, I am of opinion that\nit would be expedient to affix an annual allowance of $2,000 to each\nof the appointments of the six principal and most populous provinces,\n$1,500 for the next in importance, and for the twelve or thirteen\nremaining, at the rate of $1,000 each; leaving to the candidates\nthe option of rising according to their length of services and good\nconduct, from the lowest to the highest, as is the case in Spain.",
        "[Objects to be gained.] The first part of the plan above pointed\nout embraces two objects. The one is to prevent the provincial\nmagistrates from carrying on traffic, thus depriving them of every\npretext to defraud the natives of what is their own; and the other,\nto form, in the course of a few years a class of men hitherto unknown\nin the Philippine Islands, who, taught by practice, may be enabled to\ngovern the provinces in a more correct and regular manner, and acquire\nmore extended knowledge, especially in the judicial proceedings of\nthe first instance, which, owing to this defect, frequently compel\nthe litigants to incur useless expenses, and greatly embarrass the\nordinary course of justice. Although the second part at first seems\nto involve an increased expense of $36,000 or $37,000 annually,\nwhen well considered, this sum will be found not to exceed $20,000,\nbecause it will be necessary to deduct from the above estimate the\namount of three per cent. under the existing regulations allowed to\nthe magistrates for the collection of the native tributes, in their\ncharacter of subdelegates, generally amounting to $16,000 or $17,000;\nbesides only taking into account such real and effective disbursements\nor extraordinary expenses as in fact they may legally have incurred\nin the performance of their duties.",
        "Should it, however, be deemed expedient, from causes just in their\nnature, hereafter to exonerate the natives from the obligations of\npaying tributes, by which means the amount deducted for the three\nper cent. commission could not then be brought into account, let\nme be allowed to ask what enlightened government would hesitate\nsubmitting to an additional expense of so trifling an import, in\nexchange for beholding more than two millions of men forever freed\nfrom the extortionate acts of their old magistrates; and, through\nthe effects of the new regulations, the latter converted into real\nfathers of the people over whom they are placed? How different would\nthen be the aspect these fine provinces would present to the eyes\nof the philosophical observer who would, in that case, be able to\ncalculate to what an extent the progress of agriculture and industry\nin these islands might be carried.",
        "[Demoralization of over-seas service.] Nevertheless, I do not wish\nto insinuate that by the better organization of the provincial\ngovernments, the present irregularities and abuses of authority\nwould entirely cease; because I am aware, more especially in the\nIndies, that the persons who hold public situations usually have too\nexaggerated ideas of their own personal importance, and easily mistake\nthe gratification of their own whims for firmness of character,\nin the necessity of causing themselves to be respected. Still it\nis an incontestable fact that, by removing the chief temptation,\nand rescinding altogether the license to trade, the just complaints\npreferred by the native against the Spaniard would cease; the motives\nof those continual disputes which arise between the magistrates\nand the ministers of the gospel exercising their functions in the\nsame provinces, and the zealous defenders of the rights of their\nparishioners, would be removed, and the inhabitants of Manila,\nextending their mercantile operations to the interior, without the\ndread of seeing them obstructed through the powerful competition\nof the magistrates in authority there, would be induced to settle\nin or connect themselves with the provinces, and thus diffuse their\nknowledge, activity and money among the inhabitants, the true means\nof encouraging the whole.",
        "What has already been said will suffice to convince the lover of\ntruth and the friend of general prosperity, how urgent it is to\nintroduce as early as possible, the reform proposed into the interior\nadministration of this important, although neglected colony; and it\nis to be hoped that the government, guided by these same sentiments,\nwill not be led away by those narrow-minded people, who predict danger\nfrom every thing that is new; but, after due and mature deliberation,\nresolve to adopt a measure dictated by reason, and at the same time\nconformable to the best interests of the state.",
        "Of little avail would have been the valor and constancy with which\nLegaspi and his worthy companions overcame the natives of these\nislands, if the apostolic zeal of the missionaries had not seconded\ntheir exertions, and aided to consolidate the enterprise. The latter\nwere the real conquerors; they who, without any other arms than their\nvirtues, won over the good will of the islanders, caused the Spanish\nname to be beloved, and gave to the king, as it were by a miracle,\ntwo millions more of submissive and Christian subjects. These were\nthe legislators of the barbarous hordes who inhabited the islands\nof this immense Archipelago, realizing, by their mild persuasion,\nthe allegorical prodigies of Amphion and Orpheus.",
        "[Pioneer Philippine government a theocracy.] As the means the\nmissionaries called in to their aid, in order to reduce and civilize\nthe Indians, were preaching and other spiritual labors, and, although\nscattered about and acting separately, they were still subject to\nthe authority of their prelates, who, like so many chiefs, directed\nthe grand work of conversion, the government primitively established\nin these colonies must necessarily have partaken greatly of the\ntheocratical order, and beyond doubt it continued to be so, till,\nby the lapse of time, the number of colonists increased, as well as\nthe effective strength of the royal authority, so as to render the\ngoverning system uniform with that established in the other ultramarine\ndominions of Spain.",
        "This is also deduced from the fragments still remaining of the first\nconstitution, or mode of government introduced in the Batanes Islands\nand missions of Cagayan, administered by the Dominican friars in a\nspiritual and temporal manner; as well as from what may frequently be\nobserved in the other provinces, by any one who bestows the smallest\nattention. Although the civil magistracies have since been regulated,\nand their respective attributes determined with due precision, it has\nnot hitherto been possible, notwithstanding the pains taken to make the\ncontrary appear, to do without the personal authority and influence\nthe parish curates possess over their flocks. The government has, in\nfact, constantly been obliged to avail themselves of this aid, as the\nmost powerful instrument to insure respect and a due subordination,\nin such manner that, although the parish curates are not at present\nequally authorized to interfere in the civil administration, in point\nof fact, they are themselves the real administrators.",
        "[Standing of parish priests.] It happens that, as the parish curate\nis the consoler of the afflicted, the peacemaker of families, the\npromoter of useful ideas, the preacher and example of every thing good;\nas in him liberality is seen to shine, and the Indians behold him alone\nin the midst of them, without relatives, without traffic, and always\nbusied in their care and improvement, they become accustomed to live\nsatisfied and contented under his paternal direction, and deliver up to\nhim the whole of their confidence. In this way rendered the master of\ntheir wishes, nothing is done without the advice, or rather consent,\nof the curate. The subaltern governor, on receiving an order from the\nsuperior magistrate, before he takes any step, goes to the minister\nto obtain his sanction, and it is he in fact who tacitly gives the\nmandate for execution, or prevents its being carried into effect. As\nthe father of his flock, he arranges, or directs, the lawsuits of\nhis parishioners; it is he who draws out their writings; goes to the\ncapital to plead for the Indians; opposes his prayers, and sometimes\nhis threats, to the violent acts of the provincial magistrates, and\narranges every thing in the most fit and quiet manner. In a word, it\nis not possible for any human institution to be more simple, and at\nthe same time more firmly established, or from which so many advantages\nmight be derived in favor of the state, as the one so justly admired in\nthe spiritual ministry of these islands. It may therefore be considered\na strange fatality, when the secret and true art of governing a colony,\nso different from any other as is that of the Philippines, consists in\nthe wise use of so powerful an instrument as the one just described,\nthat the superior government, within the last few years, should have\nbeen so much deluded as to seek the destruction of a work which,\non the contrary, it is, above all others, advisable to sustain.",
        "In this, as well as many other cases, we see how difficult, or rather\nhow absurd it is, to expect to organize a system of government,\nindistinctly adapted to the genius and disposition of all nations,\nhowever great the discordance prevailing in their physical and moral\nconstitutions. Hence it follows that, by wishing to assimilate\nthe administrative plan of these provinces to the one adopted in\nthe sections of America, inconveniences are unceasingly met with,\nevidently arising out of this erroneous principle. Whatever may\nbe asserted to the contrary, there is no medium. It is necessary to\ninsure obedience either through dread and force, or respect must be\nexcited by means of love and confidence. In order to be convinced that\nthe first is not practicable, it will only be necessary to weigh well\nthe following circumstances and reflections.",
        "The number of the whites compared to that of the natives is so\nsmall, that it can scarcely be estimated in the proportion of 15\nto 25,000. These provinces, infinitely more populous than those of\nAmerica, are entirely delivered up to the charge of provincial [Friars\nonly check on officials.] magistrates, who carry with them to the seats\nof their respective governments, no other troops than the title of\nmilitary commandants, and their royal commission on parchment. Besides\nthe friars, it sometimes happens that no other white person is to be\nfound in an entire province, but the presiding magistrate. It is the\nduty of the latter to collect in the king’s revenue; to pursue robbers;\nappease tumults; raise men for the regiments in garrison at Manila and\nCavite; regulate and head his people in case of an external invasion,\nand, in short, it is he who is to do everything in the character of\nmagistrate and in the name of the king. Considering, therefore, the\neffective power required for the due performance of so great a variety\nof duties, and the want of that species of support experienced by him\nwho is charged with them, can it be denied that it would be risking the\nsecurity of these dominions too much, to attempt forcibly to control\nthem with means so insufficient? If the inhabitants become tumultuous\nand rise up, on whom will the magistrate call for aid to repress and\npunish them? In such a predicament, is any other alternative left him\nthan to fly or die in the struggle? If among civilized nations, it is\ndeemed indispensable that authority should always appear accompanied\nwith force, how can it be expected, among Indians, that the laws will\notherwise be respected, when left naked and unsupported?",
        "[Missionaries’ achievements.] Evidently, it is necessary to appeal to\naid of another kind, and to employ means, which, although indirect\nones, are, beyond all dispute, the best adapted to the peculiar\ncircumstances of the country,–means which, by influencing the mind,\nexcite veneration, subdue the rude understanding of the inhabitants,\nand incline them to bear our dominion without repugnance. It is well\nunderstood what these means are, how much they are at hand, and how\ngreatly also they have always been envied by other European nations,\nwho have sought to extend and consolidate their conquests in both\nthe Indies. Let us listen to La Pérouse, if we wish to know and\nadmire the army with which our missionaries subdued the natives of\nboth Californias; let us read, dispassionately, the wonderful deeds\nof the Jesuits in other parts of America, and, above all, let us\nvisit the Philippine Islands and, with astonishment, shall we there\nbehold extended ranges, studded with temples and spacious convents;\nthe Divine worship celebrated with pomp and splendor; regularity\nin the streets, and even luxury in the houses and dress; schools\nof the first rudiments in all the towns, and the inhabitants well\nversed in the art of writing. We shall there see causeways raised,\nbridges of a good architecture built, and, in short, all the measure\nof good government and police, in the greatest part of the country,\ncarried into effect, yet the whole is due to the exertions, apostolic\nlabors and pure patriotism of the ministers of religion. Let us\ntravel over the provinces, and we shall there see towns of 5000,\n10,000, and 20,000 Indians, peacefully governed by one weak old man,\nwho, with his doors open at all hours, sleeps quiet and secure in\nhis dwelling, without any other magic, or any other guards, than the\nlove and respect with which he has known to inspire his flock. And,\nwhen this is contemplated, can it be deemed possible, through foolish\njealousy and vain wish for those persons only pointed out by the\ngeneral laws in ordinary cases, to intervene in the government of the\nnatives, that the fruit of so much time constancy are not to be lost,\nbut also by hereafter disregarding and rejecting a co-operation,\nas efficient as it is economical, that attempts should purposely be\nmade to destroy the mainspring of the whole of this political machine?",
        "[Curtailing priestly authority.] Such, nevertheless, are the mistaken\nideas which, within the last few years, have unhappily led to the\nadoption of measures, diametrically opposed to the public interest,\nunder the pretext of curtailing the excessive authority of the\nparish-curates. The superior government, not satisfied with having\ndeprived the ministers of the faculty of personally prescribing certain\ncorrectional punishments, which although of little moment, when applied\nwith discretion, greatly contributed to fortify their ascendency,\nand consequently, that of the sovereign; but, in order to exclude and\ndivest them of all intervention in the civil administration, a direct\nattempt has also been made to lower the esteem in which they are held,\nby awakening the distrust of the Indian, and, as much as possible,\nremoving him to a greater distance from them. In proof of this, and\nin order that what has been said may not be deemed an exaggeration,\nit will suffice to quote the substance of two regulations, remarkable\nfor their obvious tendency to weaken the influence and credit of the\nspiritual administrators.",
        "By one of these, it is enacted that in order to prevent the abuses\nand notorious malversation of the funds of the sanctuary, specially\napplicable to the expenses of the festivities and worship of each\nparish, and arising out of the real and half for this purpose\ncontributed by each tributary person, and collected and privately\nadministered by the curate, the same shall hereafter be kept in a chest\nwith three keys, and lodged in the head-town of each province. The keys\nare to be left, one in possession of the chief magistrate, another in\nthe hands of the governor of the respective town, and the remaining\none with the parish-curate. By the other measure it is declared, as\na standing rule, that no Indian, who may lately have been employed\nin the domestic service of the curate, shall in his own town be\nconsidered eligible to any office belonging to the judicial department.",
        "On measures of this kind, comments are unnecessary; their meaning and\neffect cannot be mistaken. I shall, therefore, merely observe, that\nno untimely means could have been devised more injurious to the state,\nto the propagation of religion, and even to the natives themselves. It\nis, in fact, a most strange affair, that such endeavors should have\nbeen made to impeach the purity, by at the same time degrading the\nrespectable character of the parish-curates, more particularly at a\nperiod when, owing to partality and the scarcity of religious men,\nit would have seemed more natural to uphold, and by new inducements\nencourage the zeal and authority of the remaining few. This step\nappears the more singular, I repeat, at a moment when, neither\nby suspending the sending out of missionaries to China, and the\nalmost entire abandonment of the spiritual conquest of the Igorots\nand other infidel tribes, inhabiting the interior of these islands,\nhave the above Spanish laborers been able to carry on the ordinary\nadministration, nor prevent entire provinces from being transferred,\nas is now the case, into the hands of Indians and mestizo clergymen\nof the Sangley race, who, through their great ignorance, corrupt\nmorals, and total want of decorum, universally incur the contempt\nof the flocks committed to their care, and, in consequence of their\ntyrannical conduct, cause the people to sigh for the mild yoke of\ntheir ancient pastors.",
        "[Friars bulwark of Spanish rule.] If, therefore, it is the wish of\nthe government to retain the subjection of this colony, and raise\nit to the high degree of prosperity of which it is susceptible,\nthe first thing, in my opinion, that ought to be attended to is the\ngood organization of its spiritual administration. On this subject\nwe must not deceive ourselves. I again repeat, that as long as the\nlocal government, in consequence of the want of military forces,\nand owing to the scarcity of Europeans, does not in itself possess\nthe means of insuring obedience, no other alternative remains. It is\nnecessary to call in to its aid the powerful influence of religion,\nand to obtain from the Peninsula fresh supplies of missionaries. As\nin their nature the latter are essentially different from the other\npublic functionaries, it is well known they neither seek nor aspire to\nany remuneration for their labors, their only hope being to obtain,\nin the opinion of the community at large, that degree of respect to\nwhich they justly consider themselves entitled. Let, therefore, their\npre-eminences be retained to them: let them be treated with decorum;\nthe care and direction of the Indians confided to their charge, and\nthey always be found united in support of justice and the legitimate\nauthority.",
        "[Unwise to discredit priests.] Nothing is more unjust, and of nothing\nhave the spiritual directors of the provinces so much reason to\ncomplain, than the little discernment with which they have sometimes\nbeen judged and condemned, by causing the misconduct of some of their\nindividual members to affect the whole body. Hence is it that no one\ncan read without shame and indignation, the insidious suggestions and\nallusions, derogatory to their character, contained in the Regulations\nof Government framed at Manila in the year 1758, and which although\nmodified by orders of the king, are at the present moment still in\nforce, owing to the want of others, and found in a printed form in\nthe hands of every one. Granting that in some particular instances,\nreal causes of complaint might have existed, yet in the end, what\ndoes it matter if here and there a religious character has abused\nthe confidence reposed in him, as long as the spirit by which the\ngenerality of them are actuated, corresponds to the sanctity of their\nstate, and is besides conformable to the views of government? Why\nshould we be eternally running after an ideal of perfection which\ncan never be met with? Nor, indeed, is this necessary in the present\nconstruction of society.",
        "[Testimony in their behalf] If, however, any weight is to be attached\nto imposture with which, from personal motives, attempts have been\nmade to obscure the truth, and prejudice the public mind against\nthe regular clergy; or, if the just defense on which I have entered,\nshould be attributed to partiality or visionary impressions, let the\nArchives of the Colonial Department be opened, and we shall there\nfind the report drawn up by order of the king on November 26, 1804, by\nthe governor of the Philippine Islands, Don Rafael Maria de Aguilar,\nwith a view to convey information regarding the enquiries at that\ntime instituted respecting the reduction of the inhabitants of the\nIsland of Mindoro; a report extremely honorable to the regular clergy,\nand dictated by the experience that general had acquired during a\nperiod of more than twelve years he had governed. Therein also will\nbe seen the answer to the consultation addressed to his successor in\nthe command, Don Mariano Fernandez de Folgueras, under date of April\n25, 1809, in which he most earnestly beseeches the king to endeavor,\nby every possible means, to send out religious missionaries; deploring\nthe decline and want of order he had observed with his own eyes in the\ntowns administered by native clergymen, and pointing out the urgent\nnecessity of intrusting the spiritual government of these provinces\nto the dexterous management of the former. Testimonies of such weight\nare more than sufficient at once to refute the calumnies and contrary\nopinions put forth on this subject, and at the same time serve as\nirrefragable proofs of the scrupulous impartiality with which I have\nendeavored to discuss so delicate a matter.",
        "In a general point of view, I have alluded to the erroneous system,\nwhich during the last few years has been pursued by the government\nwith regard to the parish-curates employed in the interior, and also\nsufficiently pointed out the advantages reasonably to be expected\nif the government, acting on a different policy, or rather guided\nby other motives of state, instead of following the literal text\nof our Indian legislation, should come to the firm determination of\nindirectly divesting themselves of a small portion of their authority\nin favor of the religious laborers who are acting on the spot. Having\nsaid thus much, I shall proceed to such further details as are more\nimmediately connected with the present chapter.",
        "[Ecclesiastical Organization.] The ecclesiastical jurisdiction is\nexercised by the metropolitan archbishop of Manila, aided by the\nthree suffragans of Nueva Segovia, Nueva Caceres and Cebu.",

        "The archbishop has a salary of $5,000 and the bishops $4,000 each. The\ncuracies exceed 500, and although all of them originally were in charge\nof persons belonging to the religious orders, owing to the expulsion\nof the Jesuits and the excessive scarcity of regular clergy, so many\nnative priests have gradually been introduced among them, that,\nat present, nearly half the towns are under their direction. The\nrest are administered by the religious orders of St. Augustine,\nSt. Dominic and St. Francis, in the following manner:",

        "It ought, however, to be observed, that since the detailed statement\nwas made out, from which the above extract has been taken, so many\nmembers of the religious orders have died, that it has been necessary\nto replace them in many towns with native clergymen, as a temporary\nexpedient, and till new missionaries shall arrive from Spain.",
        "[Dual supervision over friars.] The monastic curates are immediately\nsubject to their provincial superior, in the character of friars but\ndepend on the diocesan bishop in their quality of parish priests; and\nin like manner obey their own provincial vicars, as well as those of\nthe bishop. They are alternately eligible to the dignities of their\nown order, and generally promoted, or relieved from their ministry,\nat the discretion of the provincial chapter, or according to the final\ndetermination of the vice-patron or bishop, affixed to the triple\nlist presented to him. Besides the ordinary obligations attached to\nthe care of souls, they are enjoined to assist at the elections of\ngovernors and other officers of justice, in their respective towns,\nin order to inform the chief magistrate respecting the aptitude of\nthe persons proposed for election on the triple lists, and to point\nout the legal defects attributable to any of them. On this account,\nthey are not, however, allowed to interfere in the smallest degree\nwith any of these proceedings, and much less make a formal proposal,\nas most assuredly would be advisable if permitted so to do, in favor\nof any particular person or persons in their opinion fit for the\ndischarge of the above mentioned duties. It is their obligation to\nascertain the correctness of the tribute lists presented to them\nfor their examination and signature by the chief of the clans,\nby carefully comparing them with the registers kept in their own\ndepartment; and also to certify the general returns, without which\nrequisite the statements transmitted by the chief magistrates to\nthe accountant-general’s office are not admitted. Above all they\nare bound to affix their signatures to the effective payments made\nby the magistrate to their parishioners on account of daily labor,\nand to certify similarly the value of materials employed in public\nworks. Besides the above, they are continually called upon to draw\nup circumstantial reports, or declarations, required by the superior\ntribunals; they receive frequent injunctions to co-operate in the\nincrease of the king’s revenue and the encouragement of agriculture\nand industry; in a word, there is scarcely a thing to which their\nattention is not called, and to which it is not expected they should\ncontribute by their influence, directly or indirectly.",
        "[Allowances from treasury.] The royal treasury pays them an annual\nallowance equal to $180, in kind and money, for each five hundred\ntributes under their care, and this, added to the emoluments of the\nchurch, renders the total proceeds of a curacy generally equivalent\nto about from six to eight reals for each entire tribute; but\nfrom this allowance are to be deducted the expenses of coadjutors,\nsubsistence, servants, horses, and all the other charges arising\nout of the administration of such wearisome duties; nor are the\nparishioners under any other obligation than to provide the churches\nwith assistants, or sacristans and singers, and the curates with\nprovisions at tariff prices.",
        "[Need of more European clergy.] Finally, as from what has been above\nstated it would appear, that as many as five hundred religious persons\nare necessary for the spiritual administration of the interior towns\nand districts, besides the number requisite to do the duty and fill\nthe dignities of the respective orders and convents in the capital,\nindependent of which there ought to be a proportionate surplus,\napplicable to the progressive reduction of the infidel tribes\ninhabiting the uplands, as well as the preaching of the Gospel\nin China and Cochinchina, most assuredly, it would be expedient\nto assemble and keep together a body of no less than seven hundred\npersons, if it is the wish of the government, on a tolerable scale, to\nprovide for the wants of these remote missions. At the present moment\nthe number does not exceed three hundred, including superannuated,\nexempt from service, and lay-brothers, whilst the native clergymen\nin effective possession of curacies, and including substitutes,\ncoadjutors and weekly preachers, exceed one thousand. And as the\nlatter, in general unworthy of the priesthood, are rather injurious\nthan really serviceable to the state, it should not be deemed unjust\nif they were altogether deprived of the dignity of parish curates,\nand only allowed to exercise their functions in necessary cases, or by\nattaching them to the curacies in the quality of coadjutors. By this\nplan, at the same time that the towns would be provided with suitable\nand adequate ministers, the native clergymen would be distributed\nin a proper manner and placed near the religious persons charged\nto officiate, would acquire the necessary knowledge and decorum,\nand in the course of time might obtain character and respect among\ntheir countrymen.",
        "To many, a measure of this kind may, in some respects, appear harsh\nand arbitrary; but persons, practically acquainted with the subject\nand country, will deem it indispensable, and the only means that\ncan be resorted to, in order to stop the rapid decline remarkable in\nthis interesting department of public administration. Fortunately,\nno grounded objections can be alleged against it; nor is there any\ndanger of serious consequences resulting from the plan being carried\ninto effect. In vain would it be to argue that, if the reform is to\ntake place, a large number of priests would be reduced to beggary,\nowing to the want of occupation; because, as things now stand, many of\nthe religious curates employ three or four coadjutors, and, no doubt,\nthey would then gladly undertake to make provision for the remainder\nof those who may be thrown out of employment. On the other hand, with\nequal truth it may be observed that the inhabitants of the interior,\nfar from regretting, or taking part on behalf of the native clergy,\nwould celebrate, as a day of gladness and rejoicing, the removal of\nthe latter, in return for their beloved Castilian Fathers.",
        "[Restriction of native ordinations recommended.] In case the ideas\nabove suggested should be adopted in all their parts, it may be proper\nto add that an injunction ought to be laid on the reverend bishops\nin future to confer holy orders with more scrupulosity and economy,\nthan, unfortunately, heretofore has been the case; by representing to\nthem that, if, at certain periods the Popes have been influenced by\npowerful reasons not to insist on ordinations taking place in Europe,\nas was formerly the case, very weighty motives now equally urge the\ngovernment to decline, in the Philippine Islands, paying so much to\nreligious vocation, and to relax in the policy of raising the natives\nto the dignity of the priesthood.",
        "[Moro depredations.] Long have the inhabitants of the Philippines\ndeplored, and in vain remonstrated, against the ravages committed\non their coasts and settlements by the barbarous natives of the\nIslands of Mindanao, Basilan and Jolo, as well as by the Malanos,\nIlanos and Tirone Moros and others; and there is nothing that so much\ndeserves the attention, and interests the honor of the Captain-General\ncommanding in this quarter, as an early and efficient attempt to check\nand punish these cruel enemies. It is indeed true that, in the years\n1636 and 1638, General Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, undertook in\nperson and happily carried into effect the reduction of the Sultan of\nMindanao and the conquest of the Island of Jolo, placing in the latter\na governor and establishing three military posts there; under the\nprotection of the garrisons of which, Christianity was considerably\nextended. It is equally true, that on the subsequent abandonment of\nthis important acquisition, owing to the government being compelled to\nattend to other urgent matters, the enemy acquired a greater degree of\naudacity, and the captain-general in command afterwards sent armaments\nto check his inroads. On one of these occasions, our troops obliged an\narmy of more than 5,000 Moros, who had closely beset the fortress of\nZamboanga, to raise the siege; and also in the years 1731 and 1734,\nfresh detachments of our men were landed on the Islands of Jolo,\nCapul and Basilan, and their success was followed by the destruction\nand ruin of the fortified posts, vessels, and settlements of those\nperfidious Mahometans. It is not, however, less certain that at the\nperiods above mentioned, the war was carried on rather from motives\nof punishment and revenge, and suggested by a sudden and passing zeal,\nthan in conformity to any progressive and well-combined system. Since\nthen these laudable military enterprises have been entirely neglected,\nas well on account of the indolence of some of the governors, as\nthe too great confidence placed in the protestations of friendship\nand treaties of peace with which, from time to time, the Sultans\nof Jolo and Mindanao have sought to lull them to sleep. Their want\nof sincerity is proved by the circumstance of the piracies of their\nrespective subjects not ceasing, the chiefs sometimes feigning they\nwere carried on without their license or knowledge; and, at others,\nexcusing themselves on the plea of their inability to restrain the\ninsolence of the Tirones and other independent tribes. Nevertheless,\nit is notorious that the above-mentioned sultans indirectly encouraged\nthe practice of privateering, by affording every aid in their power\nto those who fitted out vessels, and purchasing from the pirates all\nthe Christians they captured and brought to them.",
        "[A missionary’s appeal.] Father Juan Angeles, superior of the mission\nestablished in Jolo, at the request of Sultan Alimudin himself (or\nFerdinand I as he was afterwards unworthily called on being made a\nChristian with no other view than the better to gain the confidence\nof the Spaniards) in a report he sent to the government from the\nabove Island, under date of September 24, 1748, describing the\nSultan’s singular artifices to amuse him and frustrate the object\nof his mission, fully confirms all that has just been said, and,\non closing his report, makes use of the following remarkable words:",
        "“When is it we shall have had enough of treaties with these Moros, for\nhave we not before us the experience of more than one hundred years,\nduring which period of time, they have not kept a single article\nin any way burdensome to, or binding on, themselves? They will never\nobserve the conditions of peace, because their property consists in the\npossession of slaves, and with them they traffic, the same as other\nnations do with money. Sooner will the hawk release his prey from\nhis talons than they will put an end to their piracies. The cause of\ntheir being still unfaithful to Spain arises out of this matter having\nbeen taken up by fits and starts, and not in the serious manner it\nought to have been done. To make war on them, in an effectual manner,\nfleets must not be employed, but they must be attacked on land, and\nin their posts in the interior; for it is much more advisable at once\nto spend ten with advantage and in a strenuous manner to attain an\nimportant object than to lay out twenty by degrees and without fruit.”",
        "[Governmental lenience.] It is an undeniable fact that the government,\nlulled and deceived by the frequent embassies and submissive and\ncrouching letters which those fawning sultans have been in the habit\nof transmitting to them, instead of adopting the energetic measures\nurged by the above-mentioned missionary, have constantly endeavored\nto renew and secure the friendship of those chiefs, by means of\ntreaties and commercial relations; granting, with this view, ample\nlicenses to every one who ventured to ship merchandise to Jolo, and\nwinking at the traffic carried on by the governors of the fortress of\nZamboanga with the people of Mindanao; whilst the latter, on their\npart, sporting with our foolish credulity, have never ceased waging\na most destructive war against us, by attacking our towns situated\non the coast, not even excepting those of the Island of Luzon. They\nhave sometimes carried their audacity so far as to show themselves\nin the neighborhood of the capital itself, and at others taken up\ntheir temporary residence in the district of Mindoro and in places\nof the jurisdictions of Samar and Leyte; and in short, even dared\nto form an establishment or general deposit for their plunder in the\nIsland of Buras, where they quietly remained during the years 1797,\n1798 and 1799 to the great injury of our commerce and settlements.",
        "[Authority for war not lacking.] This want of exertion to remedy evils\nof so grievous a nature is the more to be deplored as the Philippine\ngovernors have at all times been fully authorized to carry on war,\nand promote the destruction of the Moros, under every sacrifice, and\nespecially by the royal orders and decrees of October 26, and November\n1, 1758, and July 31, 1766, in all of which his majesty recommends,\nin the most earnest manner, “the importance of punishing the audacity\nof the barbarous infidels, his majesty being desirous that, in order\nto maintain his subjects of the Philippines free from the piracies and\ncaptivity they so frequently experience, no expenses or pains should\nbe spared; it being further declared, that as this is an object deeply\naffecting the conscience of his majesty, he especially enjoins the\naforesaid government to observe his order; and finally, with a view\nto provide for the exigencies arising out of similar enterprises,\nthe viceroy of New Spain is instructed to attend to the punctual\nremittance, not only of the usual “situado,” or annual allowance,\nbut also of the additional sum of $70,000 in the first and succeeding\nyears, etc.” In a word, our monarchs, Ferdinand VI and Carlos III,\nomitted nothing that could in any way promote so important an object;\nwhether it is that the governors have disregarded such repeated orders\nfrom the sovereigns, or mistaken the means by which they were to be\ncarried into effect, certain it is that the unhappy inhabitants of\nthe Philippines have continued to be witnesses, and at the same time\nthe victims of the culpable apathy of those who have successively\nheld the command of these Islands within the last fifty or sixty years.",
        "[Native efforts for self-defence.] Abandoned therefore to their own\nresouces, and from time to time relieved by the presence of a few\ngunboats which, after scouring the coasts, have never been able\nto come up with the light and fast sailing vessels of the enemy,\nthe inhabitants of our towns and settlements have been under the\nnecessity of intrenching and fortifying themselves in the best way\nthey were able, by opening ditches and planting a breastwork of stakes\nand palisades, crowned with watch towers, or a wooden or stone castle;\nprecautions which sometimes are not sufficient against the nocturnal\nirruptions and robberies of the Moros, more especially when they come\nwith any strength and fire-arms, in general scarce among the natives.",
        "[Moro piratical craft.] The pancos, or prows, used by the Moros, are\nlight and simple vessels, built with numerous thin planks and ribs,\nwith a small draft of water; and being manned by dexterous rowers,\nthey appear and disappear from the horizon with equal celerity, flying\nor attacking, whenever they can do it with evident advantage. Some\nof those vessels are large, and fitted out with fifty, a hundred,\nand sometimes two hundred men. The shots of their scanty and defective\nartillery are very uncertain, because they generally carry their guns\nsuspended in slings; but they are to be dreaded, and are extremely\ndexterous in the management of the campilan, or sword, of which they\nwear the blades long and well tempered. When they have any attack\nof importance in view, they generally assemble to the number of\ntwo hundred galleys, or more, and even in their ordinary cruises,\na considerable number navigate together. As dread and the scarcity\nof inhabitants in the Bisayan Islands cause great ranges of the coast\nto be left unsettled, it is very easy for the Moros to find numerous\nlurking-places and strongholds whenever they are pressed, and their\nconstant practice, in these cases, is to enter the rivers, ground\ntheir vessels, and hide them among the mangroves and thick foliage,\nand fly with their arms to the mountains, thus almost always laughing\nat the efforts of their opponents, who seldom venture to follow them\ninto the thickets and morasses, where the musket is of no use and a\nsingle step cannot be taken with any security.",
        "[Outrages suffered.] The fatal consequences and ravages of this system\nof cruising and warfare round the Islands are incalculable. Besides\nplundering and burning the towns and settlements, these bloody\npirates put the old and helpless to the sword, destroy the cattle\nand plantations, and annually carry off to their own homes as many as\na thousand captives of both sexes, who, if they are poor and without\nhopes of being redeemed, are destined to drag out a miserable existence\namidst the most fatiguing and painful labor, sometimes accompanied\nwith torments. Such is the dread and apprehension of these seas that\nonly those navigate and carry on trade in them who are able to arm and\nman their vessels in a way corresponding to the great risks they have\nto run, or others whom want compels to disregard the imminent dangers\nwhich await them. Among the latter class, the Bisayans, or “painted\n(tattooed) natives,” are distinguished, an extremely warlike people of\nwhom great use might be made. Reared from their infancy amidst danger\nand battle, and greatly resembling the Moros in their features and\ndarkness of skin, they are equally alike in the agility with which\nthey manage the long sword and lance, and such is the courage and\nimplacable odium with which they treat their enemies that, if not taken\nby surprise, they sell their lives very dear, sacrificing themselves\nin a most heroic manner, rather than to be led away as captives.",
        "In order, however, that a more correct idea may be formed of the\nwicked policy and atrocious disposition of these Moros, and with a\nview to do away with the misconceptions of those who are of opinion\nthat incentives to trade, and other slow and indirect means ought\nto be employed for the purpose of overcoming them, it will suffice\nto quote the following examples among a number of others, even more\nrecent ones, which might equally be brought forward.",
        "[Instances of treachery.] In 1796, the governor of Zamboanga\ndispatched, with regular passports and under a safe conduct obtained\nfrom the Sultan of Mindanao, Lieutenant Don Pantaleon Arcillas,\nwith a sergeant, eight men, and a guide, in order to bring into\nthe fortress the cattle belonging to the king’s farm, which had\nstrayed away and got up in the lands of the above-mentioned Mahometan\nprince. Five days after their departure, whilst the lieutenant was\ntaking his meals at the house of a “Datu,” or chief, named Oroncaya,\nhe was suddenly surrounded by seventy Moros, who, seizing upon him,\nbound him to a tree and then flayed him alive, from the forehead to\nthe ankle. In this miserable and defenceless situation, the barbarous\n\"Datu” wreaked his vengeance on his body by piercing it all over\nwith his “kris,” or dagger, and then ordered his skin to be hung up\non the pole of one of his ferocious banners.",
        "In the year 1798, whilst the schooner San José lay at anchor at\nTabitabi, near Jolo, the sons-in-law and nephews of the sultan went\nout to meet her in two large prows, exhibiting at the same time every\ndemonstration of peace, and, sending forward a small vessel with\nrefreshments, they invited the captain to come on board of them. The\nlatter, deceived by the apparent frankness and high rank of the Moros,\nwith the greatest good faith accepted the invitation, and proceeded on\nboard, accompanied by two sailors, with a view to make arrangements\nfor barter. Scarcely had they got on board of the large prow, when\nthey were surrounded and seized, and the captain, who was a Spaniard,\ncompelled to sign an order to his mate to deliver up the schooner,\nwhich he reluctantly did, under the hope of saving his own and his\ncompanions’ lives. The Moros proceeded on board the Spanish vessel,\nand, in the meantime, the two sailors were taken back to the boat,\nand there killed with daggers in the presence of all. The schooner’s\nsails were next hoisted, and she was brought into Jolo, where the cargo\nand crew were sold in sight of, and with the knowledge and consent of\nthe sultan; an atrocity for which he has always refused to give any\nsatisfaction to a nation, thus openly and barbarously outraged by his\nown relatives, and in defiance of the existing treaties of peace. Such\nis the cruel character, and such the execrable policy of the Moros\ngenerally inhabiting the Islands situated in the Philippine seas.",
        "[Growth of Moro power.] The most lamentable circumstance is, that\nthese infidel races, at all times to be dreaded, owing to their\nnumbers and savage ferocity, after the lapse of a century of almost\nuninterrupted prosperity, and encouraged also by our inattention,\nhave at length gradually attained so formidable a degree of power,\nthat their reduction now must be considered an extremely arduous and\nexpensive enterprise, although an object urgently requisite, and worthy\nof the greatness of a nation like ours. In order, however, that the\ndifficulties of so important an undertaking may be justly appreciated,\nit may be proper to observe that the Island of Mindanao alone, at\nthe present moment, contains a population equal, if not larger, than\nthat of Luzon, and the margins of the immense lake, situated in its\ncenter, are covered with well-built towns, filled with conveniences,\nthe fruits of their annual privateering, and of the traffic they\ncarry on with the inhabitants of the Island of Jolo. True it is,\nand it may be said, equally fortunate, that they are greatly divided\ninto parties, subject to a variety of “datus,” or independent chiefs,\nin name only inferior to the one who styles himself the sultan of the\nwhole Island. As, however, the fortresses and districts of Caraga,\nMisamis, and Zamboanga occupy nearly three parts of the circumference\nof the Island, these Moros freely possess no more than the southern\npart, commencing at about twenty-five leagues from Cape San Augustin,\nand ending in the vicinity of Zamboanga; so that the largest number\nof their naval armaments are fitted out and issued to sea, either by\nthe great river of Mindanao, or from some of the many bays and inlets\nsituated on the above extent of coast.",
        "[Jolo.] The Island of Jolo, although small compared with that of\nMindanao, is, nevertheless, in itself the most important, as well\nas the real hotbed of all the piracies committed. Its inhabitants,\naccording to the unanimous reports of captives and various merchants,\nin skill and valor greatly exceed the other Mahometans who infest\nthese seas. The sultan is absolute, and his subjects carry on trade\nwith Borneo, Celebes, and the other Malayan tribes scattered about\nthis great Archipelago. In the port of Jolo, as already noticed,\nsales are made of Christians captured by the other Moros. The Chinese\nof Amoy, as well as the Dutch and British, carry them manufactured\ngoods, opium and arms, receiving, in return, black pepper, bees’\nwax, balato, edible nests, tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl, gold\ndust, pearls, etc., and from Manila also a vessel usually goes once\na year with goods; but all act with the greatest precaution in this\ndangerous traffic, guarding, as much as possible, against the insidious\nacts of that perfidious government. The great number of renegades,\nof all casts, who have successively naturalized themselves there;\nthe abundance of arms, and the prevailing opulence, have, in every\nrespect, contributed to render this Island a formidable and powerful\nstate. The capital is surrounded with forts and thick walls, and\nthe famous heights, standing near it, in case of emergency, afford a\nsecure asylum where the women can take refuge and the treasures of\nthe sultan and public be deposited, whilst in the plains below the\ncontest may be maintained by more than 50,000 combatants, already\nvery dexterous in the use of the musket and of a bold and courageous\ncharacter. The navy of these Islanders is also very respectable,\nfor, besides a great number of smaller prows and war-boats, they\nhave some of a large size, capable of carrying heavy artillery on\ntheir decks, mounted on corresponding carriages, and not suspended\nin slings as is the custom of the people of Mindanao. In a word,\nJolo is an Island governed by a system of administration extremely\nvigorous and decisive; dread and superstition sustain the throne of\nthe tyrant, and the fame of his greatness frequently brings to his\nfeet the ulemas, or missionaries of the Koran, even as far as from\nthe furthest margin of the Red Sea. The prince and people, unanimous\nin the implacable odium with which they view all Christians, cannot\nbe divided or kept on terms of peace; and if it is really wished to\nfree these seas from the evils and great dangers with which they are\nat all times threatened, it is necessary at once to strike at the\nroot, by landing and attacking the Jolonese in their strongholds,\nand break the charm by which they are held together.",
        "This, at least, is the constant and unshaken opinion of all\nexperienced persons and those versed in Philippine affairs; and if,\nby the substantial reasons and existing circumstances, I convince\nmyself sufficiently to openly recommend war to be undertaken against\nthe Moros and pushed with the utmost vigor, and more particularly\ncommencing the work by a formal invasion of Jolo; still, as I feel\nmyself incompetent to trace a precise plan, or to discuss the minute\ndetails more immediately connected with the object, I feel it necessary\nto confine myself to the pointing out, in general terms, of the means\nI judge most conducive to the happy issue of so arduous but important\nan enterprise, leaving the rest to more able and experienced hands.",
        "[Council of war recommended.] As a previous step, I conceive that\na council of war ought to be formed in Manila, composed of the\ncaptain-general, the commanders of the navy, artillery, and engineer\ndepartment, as well as of the regular corps, who, in conformity to\nall the antecedent information lodged in the secretary’s office for\nthe captain-generalship, and the previous report of some one of the\nex-governors of Zamboanga and the best informed missionaries, may be\nenabled to deliberate and proceed on to a mature examination of the\nwhole affair, taking into their special consideration everything\nregarding Jolo, its early reduction, the number of vessels and\nmen required for this purpose, the most advantageous points of\nattack, and the best season in which this can be carried into\nexecution. After all these matters have been determined upon, the\noperation in question ought to be connected with the other partial\nand general arrangements of the government, in order that a plan the\nbest adapted to localities and existing circumstances may be chosen,\nand without its being necessary to wait for the king’s approbation\nof the means resolved upon, owing to the distance of the court and\nthe necessity of acting with celerity. If, however, on account of\nthe deference in every respect due to the sovereign, it should be\nthought proper to reconcile his previous sanction with the necessity\nof acting without loss of time, the best mode would be to send from\nSpain an officer of high rank, fully authorized, who, as practised\non other occasions, might give his sanction, in the name of the king,\nto the resolutions adopted by the council of war, and take under his\nown immediate charge, if it should be so deemed expedient, the command\nof the expedition against Jolo, receiving the appointment of governor\nof the Island, as soon as the conquest should be carried into effect,\nas a just reward for his zeal and valor.",
        "[War popular in Philippines.] Supposing an uniformity of opinions to\nprevail with regard to the expediency of attempting the subjugation\nof Jolo, and supposing also the existence of the necessary funds to\nmeet the expenses of a corresponding armament, it may be positively\nrelied upon that the project would be extremely popular, and meet\nwith the entire concurrence and support of the Philippine Islands. The\nmilitary men, aware of the great riches known to exist in the proposed\ntheatre of operations, would emulously come forward to offer their\nservices, under a hope of sharing the booty, and the warlike natives\nof the Bisayas would be impelled on by their hatred to the Moros,\nand their ardent wishes to avenge the blood of their fathers and\nchildren. On the other hand, the abundance of regular and well\ndisciplined officers and troops, at present in the colony and the\nnumber of gun-boats found in the ports, a want of which, on other\noccasions, has always been experienced, will afford ample scope for\nthe equipment of a force competent to the important enterprise in\nview. In fact, if the operation is arranged in a systematic manner,\nand all the precautions and rules observed as are usual in cases of\nattacks premeditated against European and civilized establishments,\nthere is no reason to expect any other than a flattering and decisive\nresult, since, in reality, the whole would be directed against an\nenemy contemptible on account of his barbarism and his comparative\nignorance of the art of war.",
        "[Native assistance.] The preparations deemed necessary being made in\nManila, and the Bisayan auxiliaries assembled beforehand in Zamboanga,\nwith their arms and respective chiefs, the whole of the operation\nin question, it may be safely said, might be terminated within the\nperiod of three or four months. Supposing even 2,000 regular troops\nare destined for this expedition, with a corresponding train of field\npieces, and at the moment there should not be found in the Islands a\nsufficient number of larger vessels to embargo or freight for their\nconveyance, a competent quantity of coasters, galleys and small craft\nmight be met with at any time sufficiently capacious and secure to\ncarry the men. This substitute will be found the less inconvenient,\nbecause, as the navigation is to be performed among the Islands during\nthe prevalence of the north winds, usually a favorable and steady\nseason of the year, the voyage will consequently be safe and easy. It\nwill also be possible to arrive at the point agreed upon, as a general\nrendezvous, in twenty, or five-and-twenty days, which place, for many\nreasons, ought to be the fortress of Zamboanga, situated in front of\nJolo and at moderate distance from that Island; it being from this port\nthat, in former times, the Philippine governors usually sent out their\narmaments, destined to make war against the Basilanese and Jolonese.",
        "[Mindanao also needs attention.] As soon as this important and\nmemorable enterprise has been carried into effect, and the punishment\nand total subjugation of these faithless Mahometans completed and\nthe new conquest placed under a military authority, in the mean\ntime that the lands are distributing and arrangements making to\nestablish the civil administration, on the same plan followed in the\nother provinces of the Philippine government, the armament ought to\nreturn to Zamboanga with all possible speed; but, after stopping by\nthe way to reduce the small island of Basilan and leaving a fortress\nand garrison there. Immediately afterwards, and before the various\ntribes of Moros inhabiting the Island of Mindanao have been able to\nconcert among themselves and prepare for their defence, it would\nbe advisable to direct partial expeditions towards both flanks of\nZamboanga, for the purpose of burning the settlements of the natives\nand driving them from the shores into the interior. Forts ought then\nto be raised at the mouths of the inlets and rivers, and a fourth\ndistrict government formed in the southern part of the island; in such\nmanner that, by possession being taken of the coasts, the government\nand district of Zamboanga may be placed in contact with the new\none established on the one side, and on the other with the district\nof Misamis, also the new district with that of Caraga, the western\npart of which territory is already united to that of Misamis. Such,\nat least, was the opinion of Lieutenant-Colonel Don Mariano Tobias,\nan officer deservedly celebrated for his prudence and consummate skill\nin these matters, and this he substantially expressed in a council\nof war, held on August 28, 1778, for the purpose of deliberating on\nthe most advisable means to check the Moros, as appears by a long\nand intelligent report drawn upon this subject on April 26, 1800,\nby the adjutant-general of this colony, Don Rufino Suarez.",
        "In case it should be determined to adopt the means proposed by Colonel\nTobias, for the purpose of holding the Moros of Mindanao in check,\nand to which, unfortunately, due regard has not hitherto been paid,\nnotwithstanding the enterprise presents very few difficulties, owing\nto the little opposition to be expected from the infidel natives,\nthe latter would then be left completely surrounded and shut up in\nthe heart of the island, and their active system of privateering,\nwith which they have so many years infested these seas, entirely\ndestroyed. If, through the want of garrisons and population, it should\nnot, however, be possible to deprive them of all their outlets, by\nwhich means they would still be able occasionally to send some of\ntheir cruising vessels, nevertheless there would be facilities with\nwhich it would be possible to pursue and counteract the ravages of\nthe few pirates who might furtively escape out of some river, while\nnow they are fitted out, and well manned and armed to the number of\none and two hundred war-boats, openly in their ports.",
        "[A plan for future policing.] After the emporiums of slavery have\nbeen destroyed by the conquest of Jolo, and the other general\nmeasures adopted, as above pointed out, the government would then\nbe in a situation to turn its attention, with much greater ease,\nto the arrangement of all the other minor schemes of precaution and\nprotection suited to the difference of circumstances and locality,\nwithout the concurrence of which the work would be left imperfect,\nand in some degree the existence of those settled in the new\nestablishments rendered precarious. As, however, I am unprepared\nminutely to point out the nature of these measures, or distinctly\nto lay down a ground-work for future civilization and improvement,\nI shall merely observe, that what would then remain to be done would\nneither require any great capital, or present obstacles which might\nnot easily be overcome. The Moros being then concentrated in the\nIsland of Mindanao, and this completely surrounded on all sides by our\nforts and settlements, in the manner above described, the only enemies\nlet loose on these seas would be either the few who might, from time\nto time, elude the vigilance of our troops and district-commanders,\nor those who might have escaped from Jolo previous to its conquest,\nand taken up their abode in one or other of the Bisayas Islands; or,\nin short, such as are out cruising at the time our armament returns\nto Zamboanga and takes possession of the southern coast of Mindanao;\nin which case they would be compelled to resort to a roving life,\nestablishing, like the Jolo fugitives, temporary dwellings among the\nmangroves and thickets bordering on the shore.",
        "The principal objects then remaining for the attention of government\nwould be to guard and protect the towns and settlements established\non the coasts from the insults and inroads of banditti, impelled by\nnecessity or despair, and at the same time to promote the gradual\noverthrow or civilization of the dispersed remnant of Moorish\npopulation left in the Island. The cruising of the pirates being\nthus reduced to a space comprehended in an oblong circle formed by\nan imaginary line drawn from the southern extreme of the Island of\nLeyte, to the south-west point of Samar, which next running along\nthe north-west coast of Mindoro, on the outside of Tacao and Burias,\nand coming down to the west of Panay, Negros and Bohol, closes the\noval at the little island formed by the Strait of Panaon, about forty\ngunboats might be advantageously stationed in the narrowest passages\nfrom land to land; as, for example, in the Strait of San Juanico and\nother passes of a similar kind, well known to the local pilots. By this\nmeans, the limits would be gradually contracted. Various small naval\narmaments ought, at the same time, to keep cruising in the center\nof this circle, pursuing the Moros by sea and land, dislodging them\nfrom their strongholds and lurking places, and sending on those who\nmight be captured to the depot pointed out by government.",
        "[Feasibility of plans.] The first part of the plan would be the\nmore easily realized, as it is well-known that most of the districts\ncorresponding to the Bisayan tribes, including those of Camarines and\nAlbay, situated at the extremity of the island of Luzon, have several\ngunboats of their own, which might be used with great advantage. By\nmerely advancing and stationing them in such channels as the Moros\nmust necessarily pass, either in going out or returning, according to\nthe different monsoons, they would easily be checked, without removing\nthe gunboats to any great distance from their own coasts. As besides\nthe great advantages resulting from this plan and every one doing\nhis duty are apparent, no doubt numbers of natives would volunteer\ntheir services, more particularly if they were liberally rewarded,\nand their maintenance provided from the funds of the respective\ncommunities. Moreover, the points which at first should not be\nconsidered as sufficiently guarded might be strengthened by the king’s\ngunboats, and, indeed, in all of them it would be advisable to station\nsome of the latter, commanded by a select officer, to whose orders\nthe captains of the provincial gunboats ought to be made subservient.",
        "With regard to the second part, it will suffice to observe that the\ncaptain-generalship of the Philippine Islands already possesses as\nmany as seventy gunboats, besides a considerable number of gallies\nand launches, which altogether constitute a formidable squadron\nof light vessels; and, after deducting those deemed necessary for\nthe protection of Jolo and the new province to be established in\nMindanao, a sufficient number would still be left to carry into\nexecution all the objects proposed. At present, although the Moros\nnavigate in numerous divions, and with a confidence inspired by their\nundisturbed prosperity, a 24-pounder shot from one of our launches is\nnevertheless sufficient to put them to flight; what therefore may not\nbe expected when their forces shall be so greatly diminished and their\napprehensions increased, of being defeated and captured? Nevertheless,\nas it is not easy for our gunboats to come up with them, when giving\nchase, it would be advisable to add to our cruisers a temporary\nestablishment of prows and light vessels, manned by Bisayan Indians,\nwhich, by advancing on with the gallies, might attack the enemy and\ngive time for the gunboats to come up and decide the action. Besides as\nthe Bisayan Indians are perfectly acquainted with the mode of making\nwar on the Moros, the meaning of their signals and manoeuvers and\nthe kind of places on shore in which they take shelter when pursued\nat sea, the employment of such auxiliaries would be extremely useful.",
        "[Need of undivided leadership.] The whole of these defensive and\noffensive arrangements would, however, be ineffectual or incomplete\nin their results, if the most perfect union and concert is not\nestablished in every part, so that all should conspire to the same\nobject, although by distinct means. In order therefore that the\nnecessary harmony may be secured, it would be expedient to remove the\nchief authority nearer to the theater of war, by confiding all the\nnecessary instructions and powers to the person who might be selected\nfor the direction and command of the enterprise, after the general\nplan of operations had been regularly approved. Under this impression,\nand with a view to the better execution of all the details, it would\nbe advisable for the commanding officer, named by the government,\nto take up his headquarters in the Island of Panay, which, owing to\nits geographical situation, the great number of towns and inhabitants\ncontained in the three provinces into which it is divided, as well\nas other political reasons, is generally esteemed preferable for the\nobject in question, to the Island of Zebu, where, in former times,\nthe commanders of the province of the painted natives resided,\nas mentioned in the laws of the Indies. The center of action being\nplaced in Iloilo, a communication with the other points would thus\nmore easily be kept open, aid and relief might be sent more rapidly\nto the quarter where required, and, in a word, all the movements,\nof whatsoever kind they might be, would be executed with greater\nprecision and certainty of success. It would be unnecessary to\nadd that the provincial magistrates of Camarines and Albay ought to\nco-operate, with their fourteen gunboats and other smaller vessels, in\nthe measures adopted by the commander of the Bisayan establishment,\ndistributing their forces according to the orders given by him,\nand by undertaking to guard the straits of San Bernardino.",
        "[Paragua.] The Island of Paragua, at the head of which the\nprovincial jurisdiction of Calamianes is placed, is not included\nin the great circle, or chain of stations, above traced out, as\nwell in consequence of its great distance from the other islands,\nfor which reason it is not so much infested by the Moros, as because\nof its being at present nearly depopulated and uncultivated, and for\nthese reasons the attention of government ought not to be withdrawn\nfrom other more important points. With regard to that of Mindanao,\nthe necessity of keeping up along the whole of its immense coast, a\nline of castles and watch towers, has already been fully pointed out,\nmore especially in the vicinity of the bay of Panguil, to the north,\nand the mouths of the great river towards the south; the two points\nin which the enemies’ most formidable armaments are usually fitted\nout. Consequently, it would not be possible to expect the provincial\ncommanders stationed there would be able to disengage any part of\ntheir naval force, in order to place it at the disposal of the officer\ncommanding the Bisayan vessels. Indeed, it is obvious that it would be\nextremely important to afford the people of Mindanao every possible\nadditional aid, in vessels, troops and money, in order the better to\ncheck the sailing of partial divisions of the enemy, and thus prevent\nthe immense number of pirates, inhabiting the interior of the island,\nfrom breaking the fortified line, and again covering these seas, and\nwith redoubled fury carrying death and desolation along all the coasts.",
        "It would, in fact, be extremely desirable if, through the concerted\nmeasures and constant vigilance of the four chief magistrates\nintrusted with the command of the island, the future attempts of\nthe Mindanayans could be entirely counteracted, and their cruisers\naltogether kept within the line for a certain period of years; as by\nthus depriving them of the facilities to continue their old habits\nof life, these barbarous tribes would be eventually compelled to\nadopt other pursuits, either by ascending the mountainous parts of\nthe island, and shutting themselves up in the thick and impenetrable\nforests, with a view to preserve their independence; or, throwing\ndown their arms and devoting themselves to the peaceful cultivation\nof their lands. In the latter case, they would gradually lose their\npresent ferocious character; their regard for the conveniences and\nrepose of social life would increase; the contrast would be attended\nwith most favorable consequences, and in the course of time, the whole\nof the aboriginal natives of these islands would come into our laws\nand customs, and become confounded in the general mass of Philippine\nsubjects, owing allegiance to the king.",
        "Finally, it must be equally acknowledged that the Islands of Jolo,\nBasilan, Capul, and some of the other inferior ones, of which,\nas above pointed out, an union ought to be formed in the way of an\nadditional government, subordinate to the captain-general, would be\nable to co-operate in the war on no other plan than the one traced\nout for the provinces held in Mindanao; that is, by their gunboats\nbeing confided to the protection of their own coasts; though with\nthis difference, that if, in one instance, the main object would be\nto prevent the evasion of the enemy, in the other every effort must\nbe employed to guard against and repel their incursions when they\ndo appear. However complete the success of the armament, destined\nfor the reduction of Jolo, it may nevertheless be presumed, that the\nmountains would still continue to give shelter to hordes of fugitives,\nwho would take refuge in the fastnesses, and avail themselves of every\nopportunity to concert plans, or fly off to join their comrades in\nMindanao, in order to return, and through their aid, satisfy their\nthirst for vengeance, by surprising some fortress or settlement,\nor establishing themselves on some neglected and not well known\npoint. In consequence of this, the governor, commanding there,\nwould at first require the active co-operation of all his forces,\nfor the purpose of consolidating the new conquest, and causing his\nauthority to be respected throughout the island.",
        "[Importance of peace for Philippine progress.] These, in my opinion,\nare the true and secure means by which the enemies of the peace\nand prosperity of the Philippines may be humbled, their piracies\nprevented, and a basis laid for the future civilization of the\nremaining islands in this important Archipelago. To this sketch,\na number of other details and essential illustrations, no doubt,\nare wanting; and possibly, I may be accused of some inaccuracies, in\ndiscussing a topic, with which I candidly avow I cannot be considered\naltogether familiar. The plan and success of the enterprise must,\nhowever, greatly depend on military skill and talent; but as I have\nattempted no more than fairly to trace the general outline of the\nplan, and insist on the necessity of its adoption, my remarks, it\nis to be hoped, will serve to awaken a serious disposition to review\nand investigate the whole subject, a task that most assuredly ought\nto be confided to a competent and special council. Whatever defects\nI may involuntarily have fallen into, will then be corrected; at the\nsame time it ought not to appear strange that inexperienced persons\nshould presume to speak on matters connected with the public good,\nwhen we see them so much neglected by those whose more immediate duty\nit is to look after and promote them. At all events, dispassionate\nzeal has seldom done harm; and I again repeat, that my wish is not\nso much to see my own ideas adopted, as to urge the necessity of\ntheir being examined and digested. I am desirous that other sources\nof information on this subject should be explored, that practical men\nshould be called in, and that those in power should be induced to apply\nthemselves and devote their exertions to an object so highly deserving\nof their attention. In short, I am anxious that the pious injunctions\nof our monarchs should be fulfilled, and that the tears and blood of\nthe inhabitants of these neglected islands should cease to flow.",
        "Should the happy day ever arrive, when the inhabitants of these\nprovinces shall behold themselves free from the cruel scourge with\nwhich they have been desolated for so many years, they will bless the\nnation that has redeemed them from all their cares, they will tighten\ntheir relations with it, and deliver themselves up to its direction\nwithout reserve. The natives will then come down from the strong\nfastnesses they at present inhabit; they will clear fresh lands, and\nearnestly devote themselves to tillage and industry. Under the shadow\nof peace, population and commerce will increase; the Bisayan vessels\nwill then plough the ocean without the dread of other enemies than\nthe elements; and the Moros themselves of Mindanao (I say it with\nconfidence), straightened on all sides, and incessantly harassed\nby the Christians, but on the other hand witnessing the advantages\nand mildness of our laws, will at length submit to the dominion of\nthe monarchs of Spain, who will thus secure the quiet possession of\none of the most interesting portions of the habitable globe, and be\njustly entitled to the gratitude of all nations connected with China\nand India, for having put an end to a series of the most terrific\nplunder and captivity that ever disgraced the annals of any age.",
        "Manila in 1842",
        "By Com. Charles Wilkes, U.S.N.",
        "(Narrative of U. S. Exploring Expedition, Vol. V, Chaps. 8 and 9.)",
        "[Port rules.] At daylight, on January 13, we were again under way,\nwith a light air, and at nine o’clock reached the roadstead, where we\nanchored in six fathoms water, with good holding-ground. Being anxious\nto obtain our letters, which, we were informed at Oahu, had been sent\nto Manila, I immediately dispatched two boats to procure them. On\ntheir way to the mole, they were stopped by the captain of the port,\nDon Juan Salomon, who requested them, in a polite manner, to return,\nand informed the officers that, agreeably to the rules of the port,\nno boat was permitted to land until the visit of the health-officer\nhad been made, etc.",
        "[Official courtesies.] The captain of the port, in a large barge,\nwas soon seen pulling off in company with the boats. He boarded us\nwith much ceremony, and a few moments sufficed to satisfy him of\nthe good health of the crew, when he readily gave his assent to\nour visiting the shore. Every kind of assistance was offered me,\non the part of the government, and he, in the most obliging manner,\ngave us permission to go and come when we pleased, with the simple\nrequest that the boats should wear our national flag, that they might\nat all times be known, and thus be free from any interruption by the\nguards. The boats were again dispatched for the consul and letters,\nand after being anxiously watched for, returned; every one on board\nship expecting his wishes to be gratified with news from home; but,\nas is usual on such occasions, the number of the happy few bore no\ncomparison to that of the many who were disappointed.",
        "Our vice-consul, Josiah Moore, Esq., soon paid us a visit, and gave\nus a pressing invitation to take up our quarters on shore while we\nremained. To this gentleman and Mr. Sturges I am greatly indebted for\nmuch of the information that will be detailed in the following chapter.",
        "[American hemp ships.] A number of vessels were lying in the roads,\namong which were several Americans loading with hemp. There was also a\nlarge English East Indiaman, manned by Lascars, whose noise rendered\nher more like a floating Bedlam than any thing else to which I can\nliken it.",
        "[A Spanish oriental city.] The view of the city and country around\nManila partakes both of a Spanish and an Oriental character. The\nsombre and heavy-looking churches, with their awkward towers; the long\nlines of batteries mounted with heavy cannon; the massive houses,\nwith ranges of balconies; and the light and airy cottage, elevated\non posts, situated in the luxuriant groves of tropical trees–all\nexcite a desire to become better acquainted with the country.",
        "[Surroundings.] Manila is situated on an extensive plain, gradually\nswelling into distant hills, beyond which, again, mountains rise in\nthe back ground to the height of several thousand feet. The latter\nare apparently clothed with vegetation to their summits. The city is\nin strong contrast to this luxuriant scenery, bearing evident marks\nof decay, particularly in the churches, whose steeples and tile roofs\nhave a dilapidated look. The site of the city does not appear to have\nbeen well chosen, it having apparently been selected entirely for\nthe convenience of commerce, and the communication that the outlet\nof the lake affords for the batteaux that transport the produce from\nthe shores of the Laguna de Bay to the city.",
        "[Canals.] There are many arms or branches to this stream, which have\nbeen converted into canals; and almost any part of Manila may now be\nreached in a banca.",
        "In the afternoon, in company with Captain Hudson, I paid my first visit\nto Manila. The anchorage considered safest for large ships is nearly\nthree miles from the shore, but smaller vessels may lie much nearer,\nand even enter the canal; a facility of which a number of these take\nadvantage, to accomplish any repairs they may have occasion to make.",
        "[Typhoons.] The canal, however, is generally filled with coasting\nvessels, batteaux from the lake, and lighters for the discharge of\nthe vessels lying in the roads. The bay of Manila is safe, excepting\nduring the change of the monsoons, when it is subject to the typhoons\nof the China Seas, within whose range it lies. These blow at times with\nmuch force, and cause great damage. Foreign vessels have, however,\nkept this anchorage, and rode out these storms in safety; but native\nas well as Spanish vessels, seek at these times the port of Cavite,\nabout three leagues to the southwest, at the entrance of the bay,\nwhich is perfectly secure. Here the government dockyard is situated,\nand this harbor is consequently the resort of the few gunboats and\ngalleys that are stationed here.",
        "[Twin piers.] The entrance to the canal or river Pasig is three hundred\nfeet wide, and is enclosed between two well-constructed piers, which\nextend for some distance into the bay. On the end of one of these is\nthe light-house, and on the other a guard-house. The walls of these\npiers are about four feet above ordinary high water, and include the\nnatural channel of the river, whose current sets out with some force,\nparticularly when the ebb is making in the bay.",
        "[Suburbs.] The suburbs, or Binondo quarter, contain more inhabitants\nthan the city itself, and is the commercial town. They have all the\nstir and life incident to a large population actively engaged in trade,\nand in this respect the contrast with the city proper is great.",
        "[Walled city.] The city of Manila is built in the form of a large\nsegment of a circle, having the chord of the segment on the river:\nthe whole is strongly fortified, with walls and ditches. The houses\nare substantially built after the fashion of the mother country. Within\nthe walls are the governor’s palace, custom-house, treasury, admiralty,\nseveral churches, convents, and charitable institutions, a university,\nand the barracks for the troops; it also contains some public squares,\non one of which is a bronze statue of Charles IV.",
        "The city is properly deemed the court residence of these islands; and\nall those attached to the government, or who wish to be considered as\nof the higher circle, reside here; but foreigners are not permitted\nto do so. The houses in the city are generally of stone, plastered,\nand white or yellow washed on the outside. They are only two stories\nhigh, and in consequence cover a large space, being built around a\npatio or courtyard.",
        "[Dwellings.] The ground-floors are occupied as storehouses,\nstables, and for porters’ lodges. The second story is devoted to\nthe dining-halls and sleeping apartments, kitchens, bath-rooms,\netc. The bed-rooms have the windows down to the floor, opening on wide\nbalconies, with blinds or shutters. These blinds are constructed with\nsliding frames, having small squares of two inches filled in with\na thin semi-transparent shell, a species of Placuna; the fronts of\nsome of the houses have a large number of these small lights, where\nthe females of the family may enjoy themselves unperceived.",
        "[Business.] After entering the canal, we very soon found ourselves\namong a motley and strange population. On landing, the attention is\ndrawn to the vast number of small stalls and shops with which the\nstreets are lined on each side, and to the crowds of people passing\nto and fro, all intent upon their several occupations. The artisans in\nManila are almost wholly Chinese; and all trades are local, so that in\neach quarter of the Binondo suburb the privilege of exclusive occupancy\nis claimed by some particular kinds of shops. In passing up the\nEscolta (which is the longest and main street in this district), the\ncabinet-makers, seen busily at work in their shops, are first met with;\nnext to these come the tinkers and blacksmiths; then the shoe-makers,\nclothiers, fishmongers, haberdashers, etc. These are flanked by outdoor\noccupations; and in each quarter are numerous cooks, frying cakes,\nstewing, etc., in movable kitchens; while here and there are to be\nseen betel-nut sellers, either moving about to obtain customers,\nor taking a stand in some great thoroughfare. The moving throng,\ncomposed of carriers, waiters, messengers, etc., pass quietly and\nwithout any noise: they are generally seen with the Chinese umbrella,\npainted in many colors, screening themselves from the sun. The whole\npopulation wear slippers, and move along with a slipshod gait.",
        "The Chinese are apparently far more numerous than the Malays, and the\ntwo races differ as much in character as in appearance: one is all\nactivity, while the other is disposed to avoid all exertion. They\npreserve their distinctive character throughout, mixing but very\nlittle with each other, and are removed as far as possible in their\ncivilities; the former, from their industry and perseverance, have\nalmost monopolized all the lucrative employments among the lower\norders, excepting the selling of fish and betel-nut, and articles\nmanufactured in the provinces.",
        "On shore, we were kindly received by Mr. Moore, who at once made us\nfeel at home. The change of feeling that takes place in a transfer from\nshipboard in a hot climate, after a long cruise, to spacious and airy\napartments, surrounded by every luxury that kind attentions can give,\ncan be scarcely imagined by those who have not experienced it.",
        "As we needed some repairs and supplies, to attend to these was\nmy first occupation. Among the former, we required a heavy piece\nof blacksmith-work, to prepare which, we were obliged to send our\narmourers on shore. The only thing they could procure was a place for\na forge; but coal, and every thing else, we had to supply from the\nship. I mention these things to show that those in want of repairs\nmust not calculate upon their being done at Manila with dispatch,\nif they can be accomplished at all.",
        "[City of Manila.] The city government of Manila was established\nJune 24, 1571, and the title under which it is designated is, “The\ncelebrated and forever loyal city of Manila.” In 1595, the charter\nwas confirmed by royal authority; and all the prerogatives possessed\nby other cities in the kingdom were conferred upon it in 1638. The\nmembers of the city council, by authority of the king, were constituted\na council of advisement with the governor and captain-general. The\ncity magistrates were also placed in rank next the judges; and in\n1686 the jurisdiction of the city was extended over a radius of five\nleagues. In 1818, the members of the council were increased and ordered\nto assume the title of “Excellency.” Manila has been one of the most\nconstantly loyal cities of the Spanish kingdom, and is, in consequence,\nconsidered to merit these additional royal favors to its inhabitants.",
        "[Commerce.] In 1834, the Royal Tribunal of Commerce was instituted,\nto supersede the old consulate, which had been established since 1772,\nThe Royal Tribunal of Commerce acts under the new commercial code, and\npossesses the same privileges of arbitration as the old consulate. It\nconsists of a prior, two consuls, and four deputies, elected by the\nprofession. The three first exercise consular jurisdiction, the other\nfour superintend the encouragement of commerce. The “Junta de Comercio\"\n(chamber of commerce) was formed in 1835. This junta consits of the\nTribunal of Commerce, with four merchants, who are selected by the\ngovernment, two of whom are removed annually. The prior of the Tribunal\npresides at the Junta, whose meetings are required to be held twice a\nmonth, or oftener if necessary, and upon days in which the Tribunal\nis not in session. The two courts being under the same influences,\nand having the same officers, little benefit is to be derived from\ntheir double action, and great complaints are made of the manner in\nwhich business is conducted in them.",
        "[Magellan.] Of all her foreign possessions, the Philippines have\ncost Spain the least blood and labor. The honor of their discovery\nbelongs to Magellan whose name is associated with the straits at\nthe southern extremity of the American continent, but which has\nno memorial in these islands. Now that the glory which he gained\nby being the first to penetrate from the Atlantic to the Pacific,\nhas been in some measure obliterated by the disuse of those straits\nby navigators, it would seem due to his memory that some spot among\nthese islands should be set apart to commemorate the name of, him\nwho made them known to Europe. This would be but common justice to\nthe discoverer of a region which has been a source of so much honor\nand profit to the Spanish nation, who opened the vast expanse of the\nPacific to the fleets of Europe, and who died fighting to secure the\nbenefits of his enterprise to his king and country.",
        "Magellan was killed at the island of Mactan, on April 26, 1521;\nand Duarte, the second in command, who succeeded him, imprudently\naccepting an invitation from the chief of Cebu to a feast, was, with\ntwenty companions, massacred. Of all the Spaniards present, only one\nescaped. After these and various other misfortunes, only one vessel\nof the squadron, the Victoria, returned to Spain. Don Juan Sebastian\ndel Cano, her commander, was complimented by his sovereign by a grant\nfor his arms of a globe, with the proud inscription, commemorative\nof his being the first circumnavigator, “Primus Me Circumcedit.”",
        "[Other expeditions.] Two years afterwards, a second expedition was\nfitted out, under the command of Loaisa, who died after they had\npassed through the Straits of Magellan, when they had been a year\non their voyage. The command then fell upon Sebastian, who died in\nfour days after his predecessor. Salazar succeeded to the command,\nand reached the Ladrone Islands, but shortly after leaving there\nhe died also. They came in sight of Mindanao, but contrary winds\nobliged them to go to the Moluccas. When arrived at the Portuguese\nsettlements, contentions and jealousies arose, and finally all the\nexpedition was dispersed, and the fate of all but one of the vessels\nhas become doubtful. None but the small tender returned, which,\nafter encountering great difficulties, reached New Spain.",
        "The third expedition was fitted out by Cortes, then viceroy of Mexico,\nand the command of it given to Saavedra. This sailed from the port\nof Silguattanjo, on the 31st of October, 1528, and stopped at the\nLadrone Islands, of which it took possession for the crown of Spain. It\nafterwards went to Mindanao, and then pursued its voyage to Timor,\nwhere part of the expedition of Loaisa was found remaining. From\nTimor they made two attempts to return to New Spain, both of which\nfailed. The climate soon brought on disease, which carried off a great\nnumber, and among them Saavedra. Thus the whole expedition was broken\nup, and the survivors found their way to the Portuguese settlements.",
        "The fourth expedition was sent from New Spain, when under the\ngovernment of Don Antonio de Mendoza, for the purpose of establishing\na trade with the new islands, and it received orders not to visit\nthe Moluccas. This expedition sailed in 1542, under the command\nof Villalobos. It reached the Philippine Islands without accident,\nand Villalobos gave them that name after Philip II, then prince of\nAsturias. Notwithstanding his positive instructions to the contrary,\nhe was obliged to visit the Moluccas, and met the same treatment from\nthe Portuguese that had been given to all whom they believed had any\nintention to interfere in their spice trade. The squadron touched at\nAmboina, where Villalobos died, an event which caused the breaking\nup of the expedition; and the few Spaniards that remained embarked\nin the Portuguese vessels to return home.",
        "The fifth and last expedition was ordered by Philip II to be sent\nfrom Mexico, when under the government of Don Luis de Velasco,\nfor the final conquest and settlement of the Philippines. With\nthis expedition was sent Andres Urdaneta, a friar, whose reputation\nstood very high as a cosmographer: he had belonged to the ill-fated\nexpedition of Loaisa. This was the largest that had yet been fitted\nout for this purpose, numbering five vessels and about four hundred\nmen. The command of it was intrusted to [Legaspi.] Legaspi, under\nwhom it sailed from the port of Natividad, on November 21, 1564, and\nupon whom was conferred the title of governor and adelantado of the\nconquered lands, with the fullest powers. On the 13th of February,\n1565, he arrived at the island of Tandaya, one of the Philippines:\nfrom thence he went to Leyte; there he obtained the son of a powerful\nchief as a guide, through whom he established peace with several of\nthe native rulers, who thereafter aided the expedition with all the\nmeans in their power. At Bohol they built the first church. There he\nmet and made peace with a chief of Luzon, with whom he went to that\nisland. (Facts here are confused.–C.)",
        "He now (April, 1565) took possession of all the island in the name of\nthe crown of Spain, and became their first governor. In this conquest,\nmotives different from those which governed them on the American\ncontinent, seemed to have influenced the Spaniards. Instead of carrying\non a cruel war against the natives, they here pursued the policy of\nencouraging and fostering their industry. Whether they felt that this\npolicy was necessary for the success of their undertaking, or were\ninfluenced by the religious fathers who were with them, is uncertain;\nbut their measures seem to have been dictated by a desire to promote\npeace and secure the welfare of the inhabitants. There may be another\ncause for this course of action, namely, the absence of the precious\nmetals, which held out no inducement to those thirsting for inordinate\ngain. This may have had its weight in exempting the expedition in\nits outset from the presence of those avaricious spirits which had\naccompanied other Spanish expeditions, and been the means of marking\ntheir progress with excessive tyranny, bloodshed, and violence. It is\nevident to one who visits the Philippines that some other power besides\nthe sword has been at work in them; the natives are amalgamated with\nthe Spaniards, and all seem disposed to cultivate the land and foster\ncivilization. None of the feeling that grows out of conquest is to be\nobserved in these islands; the two races are identified now in habits,\nmanners, and religion, and their interests are so closely allied that\nthey feel their mutual dependence upon each other.",
        "The establishment of the new constitution in Spain in the year 1825\nhas had a wonderful effect upon these colonies, whose resources have\nwithin the last ten years been developed, and improvements pushed\nforward with a rapid step. Greater knowledge and more liberal views\nin the rulers are alone wanting to cause a still more rapid advance\nin the career of prosperity.",
        "As our visit was to Luzon, we naturally obtained more personal\ninformation respecting it than the other islands. We learned that the\nnorthern peninsula [268] was composed of granite and recent volcanic\nrocks, together with secondary and tertiary deposits, while the\nsouthern peninsula is almost wholly volcanic.",
        "The northern contains many valuable mines of gold, lead, copper,\nand iron, besides coal. A number of specimens of these, and the rocks\nwhich contain them, were presented to the Expedition by Señores Araria\nand Roxas of Manila.",
        "So far as our information and observations went, the whole of the\nPhilippine Islands are of similar geological formation. In some of\nthe islands the volcanic rock prevails, while in others coal and the\nmetalliferous deposits predominate. On some of them the coal-beds\nform part of the cliffs along the shore; on others, copper is found\nin a chlorite and talcose slate. The latter is more particularly\nthe case with Luzon, and the same formation extends to Mindoro. Much\niron occurs on the mountains. Thus among the (Upland) natives, who\nare yet unsubdued by the Spaniards, and who inhabit these mountains,\nit is found by them of so pure a quality that it is manufactured\ninto swords and cleavers. These are, occasionally, obtained by the\nSpaniards in their excursions into the interior against these bands.",
        "[Tufa.] The country around Manila is composed of tufa of a light gray\ncolor, which being soft and easily worked, is employed as the common\nbuilding material in the city. It contains, sometimes, scoria and\npumice, in pieces of various sizes, besides, occasionally, impressions\nof plants, with petrified woods. These are confined to recent species,\nand include palms, etc.",
        "This tufa forms one of the remarkable features of the volcanoes of the\nPhilippine Islands, showing a strong contrast between them and those of\nthe Pacific isles, which have ejected little else than lava and scoria.",
        "Few portions of the globe seem to be so much the seat of internal\nfires, or to exhibit the effects of volcanic action so strongly as\nthe Philippines. During our visit, it was not known that any of the\nvolcanoes were in action; but many of them were smoking, particularly\nthat in the district of Albay, called Isaroc. Its latest eruption\nwas in the year 1839; but this did little damage compared with\nthat of 1814, which covered several villages, and the country for a\ngreat distance around, with ashes. This mountain is situated to the\nsouth-east of Manila one hundred and fifty miles, and is said to be\na perfect cone, with a crater at its apex.",
        "[Resources.] It does not appear that the islands are much affected\nby earth-quakes, although some have occasionally occurred that have\ndone damage to the churches at Manila.",
        "The coal which we have spoken of is deemed of value; it has a strong\nresemblance to the bituminous coal of our own country, possesses a\nbright lustre, and appears very free from all woody texture when\nfractured. It is found associated with sandstone, which contains\nmany fossils. Lead and copper are reported as being very abundant;\ngypsum and limestone occur in some districts. From this, it will\nbe seen that these islands have everything in the mineral way to\nconstitute them desirable possessions.",
        "With such mineral resources, and a soil capable of producing the\nmost varied vegetation of the tropics, a liberal policy is all that\nthe country lacks. The products of the Philippine Islands consist\nof sugar, coffee, hemp, indigo, rice, tortoise-shell, hides, ebony,\nsaffron-wood, sulphur, cotton, cordage, silk, pepper, cocoa, wax,\nand many other articles. In their agricultural operations the\npeople are industrious, although much labor is lost by the use of\ndefective implements. The plough, of very simple construction, has\nbeen adopted from the Chinese; it has no coulter, the share is flat,\nand being turned partly to one side, answers, in a certain degree,\nthe purpose of a mould-board. This rude implement is sufficient for\nthe rich soils, where the tillage depends chiefly upon the harrow,\nin constructing which a thorny species of bamboo is used. The harrow\nis formed of five or six pieces of this material, on which the thorns\nare left, firmly fastened together. It answers its purpose well, and\nis seldom out of order. A wrought-iron harrow, that was introduced\nby the Jesuits, is used for clearing the ground more effectually,\nand more particularly for the purpose of extirpating a troublesome\ngrass, that is known by the name of cogon (a species of Andropogon), of\nwhich it is very difficult to rid the fields. The bolo or long-knife,\na basket, and hoe, complete the list of implements, and answer all\nthe purposes of our spades, etc.",
        "[Draft animals.] The buffalo was used until within a few years\nexclusively in their agricultural operations, and they have lately\ntaken to the use of the ox; but horses are never used. The buffalo,\nfrom the slowness of his motions, and his exceeding restlessness\nunder the heat of the climate, is ill adapted to agricultural labor;\nbut the natives are very partial to them, notwithstanding they\noccasion them much labor and trouble in bathing them during the great\nheat. This is absolutely necessary, or the animal becomes so fretful\nas to be unfit for use. If it were not for this, the buffalo would,\nnotwithstanding his slow pace, be most effective in agricultural\noperations; he requires little food, and that of the coarsest kind;\nhis strength surpasses that of the stoutest ox, and he is admirably\nadapted for the rice or paddy fields. They are very docile when used\nby the natives, and even children can manage them; but it is said they\nhave a great antipathy to the whites, and all strangers. The usual\nmode of guiding them is by a small cord attached to the cartilage of\nthe nose. The yoke rests on the neck before the shoulders, and is of\nsimple construction. To this is attached whatever it may be necessary\nto draw, either by traces, shafts, or other fastenings. Frequently this\nanimal may be seen with large bundles of bamboo lashed to them on each\nside. Buffaloes are to be met with on the lake with no more than their\nnoses and eyes out of the water, and are not visible until they are\napproached within a few feet, when they cause alarm to the passengers\nby raising their large forms close to the boat. It is said that they\nresort to the lake to feed on a favorite grass that grows on its bottom\nin shallow water, and which they dive for. Their flesh is not eaten,\nexcept that of the young ones, for it is tough and tasteless. The milk\nis nutritious, and of a character between that of the goat and cow.",
        "The general appearance of the buffalo is that of a hybrid of the\nbull and rhinoceros. Its horns do not rise upwards, are very close\nat the root, bent backwards, and of a triangular form, with a flat\nside above. One of the peculiarities of the buffalo is its voice,\nwhich is quite low, and in the minor key, resembling that of a young\ncolt. It is as fond of mire as swine, and shows the consequence of\nrecent wallowing, in being crusted over with mud. The skin is visible,\nbeing but thinly covered with hair; its color is usually that of a\nmouse; in some individuals darker.",
        "[Rice.] Rice is, perhaps, of their agricultural products, the article\nupon which the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands most depend for\nfood and profit; of this they have several different varieties; which\nthe natives distinguish by their size and the shape of the grain:\nthe birnambang, lamuyo, malagequit, bontot-cabayo, dumali, quinanda,\nbolohan, and tangi. The three first are aquatic; the five latter\nupland varieties. They each have their peculiar uses. The dumali\nis the early variety; it ripens in three months from planting, from\nwhich circumstance it derives its name: it is raised exclusively on\nthe uplands. Although much esteemed, it is not extensively cultivated,\nas the birds and insects destroy a large part of the crop.",
        "The malagequit is very much prized, and used for making sweet and\nfancy dishes; it becomes exceedingly glutinous, for which reason it\nis used in making whitewash, which it is said to cause to become of a\nbrilliant white, and to withstand the weather. This variety is not,\nhowever, believed to be wholesome. There is also a variety of this\nlast species which is used as food for horses, and supposed to be a\nremedy and preventive against worms.",
        "The rice grounds or fields are laid out in squares, and surrounded by\nembankments, to retain the water of the rains or streams. After the\nrains have fallen in sufficient quantities to saturate the ground, a\nseed-bed is generally planted in one corner of the field, in which the\nrice is sown broadcast, about the month of June. The heavy rains take\nplace in August, when the fields are ploughed, and are soon filled with\nwater. The young plants are about this time taken from the seed-bed,\ntheir tops and roots trimmed, and then planted in the field by making\nholes in the ground with the fingers and placing four or five sprouts\nin each of them; in this tedious labor the poor women are employed,\nwhilst the males are lounging in their houses or in the shade of\nthe trees.",
        "The harvest for the aquatic rice begins in December. It is reaped\nwith small sickles, peculiar to the country, called yatap; to the\nback of these a small stick is fastened, by which they are held,\nand the stalk is forced upon it and cut. The spikes of rice are\ncut with this implement, one by one. In this operation, men, women,\nand children all take part.",
        "The upland rice requires much more care and labor in its\ncultivation. The land must be ploughed three or four times, and all\nthe turf and lumps well broken up by the harrow.",
        "During its growth it requires to be weeded two or three times, to\nkeep the weeds from choking the crop. The seed is sown broadcast in\nMay. This kind of rice is harvested in November, and to collect the\ncrop is still more tedious than in the other case, for it is always\ngathered earlier, and never reaped, in consequence of the grain not\nadhering to the ear. If it were gathered in any other way, the loss\nby transportation on the backs of buffaloes and horses, without any\ncovering to the sheaf, would be so great as to dissipate a great\nportion of the crop.",
        "It appears almost incredible that any people can remain in\nignorance of a way of preventing so extravagant and wasteful a mode\nof harvesting. The government has been requested to prohibit it on\naccount of the great expense it gives rise to; but whether any steps\nhave ever been taken in the matter, I did not learn. It is said that\nnot unfrequently a third part of the crop is lost, in consequence of\nthe scarcity of laborers; while those who are disengaged will refuse\nto work, unless they receive one-third, and even one-half of the crop,\nto be delivered free of expense at their houses. This the planters\nare often obliged to give, or lose the whole crop. Nay, unless the\nharvest is a good onc, reapers are very unwilling to engage to take it\neven on these terms, and the entire crop is lost. The laborers, during\nthe time of harvest, are supported by the planter, who is during that\ntime exposed to great vexation, if not losses. The reapers are for the\nmost part composed of the idle and vicious part of the population, who\ngo abroad over the country to engage themselves in this employment,\nwhich affords a livelihood to the poorer classes; for the different\nperiods at which the varieties of rice are planted and harvested,\ngives them work during a large portion of the year.",
        "After the rice is harvested, there are different modes of treating\nit. Some of the proprietors take it home, where it is thrown into\nheaps, and left until it is desirable to separate it from the straw,\nwhen it is trodden out by men and women with their bare feet. For\nthis operation, they usually receive another fifth of the rice.",
        "Others stack it in a wet and green state, which subjects it to heat,\nfrom which cause the grain contracts a dark color, and an unpleasant\ntaste and smell. The natives, however, impute these defects to the\nwetness of the season.",
        "The crop of both the low and upland rice, is usually from thirty\nto fifty for one: this is on old land; but on that which is newly\ncleared or which has never been cultivated, the yield is far beyond\nthis. In some soils of the latter description, it is said that for a\nchupa (seven cubic inches) planted, the yield has been a caban. The\nformer is the two-hundred-and-eighth part of the latter. This is not\nthe only advantage gained in planthing rich lands, but the saving of\nlabor is equally great; for all that is required is to make a hole\nwith the fingers, and place three or four grains in it. The upland\nrice requires but little water, and is never irrigated.",
        "The cultivator in the Philippine Islands is always enabled to secure\nplenty of manure; for vegetation is so luxuriant that by pulling the\nweeds and laying them with earth, a good stock is quickly obtained\nwith which to cover his fields. Thus, although the growth is so rank\nas to cause him labor, yet in this hot climate its decay is equally\nrapid, which tends to make his labors more successful.",
        "The rice-stacks form a picturesque object on the field; they are\ngenerally placed around or near a growth of bamboo, whose tall,\ngraceful, and feathery outline is of itself a beautiful object,\nbut connected as it is often seen with the returns of the harvest,\nit furnishes an additional source of gratification.",
        "The different kinds of rice, and especially the upland, would no doubt\nbe an acquisition to our country. At the time we were at Manila, it\nwas not thought feasible to pack it, for it had just been reaped,\nand was so green that it would not have kept. [269] Although rice\nis a very prolific crop, yet it is subject to many casualties, from\nthe locusts and other insects that devour it; the drought at other\ntimes affects it, particularly the aquatic varieties. There is a use\nto which the rice is applied here, which was new to us, namely, as a\nsubstitute for razors; by using two grains of it between the fingers,\nthey nip the beard, or extract it from the chin and face.",
        "[Manila hemp.] Among the important productions of these islands, I have\nmentioned hemp, although the article called Manila hemp must not be\nunderstood to be derived from the plant which produces the common hemp\n(Cannabis), being obtained from a species of plantain (Musa textilis),\ncalled in the Philippines “abacá.” This is a native of these islands,\nand was formerly believed to be found only on Mindanao; but this is\nnot the case, for it is cultivated on the south part of Luzon, and\nall the islands south of it. It grows on high ground, in rich soil,\nand is propagated by seeds. It resembles the other plants of the tribe\nof plantains, but its fruit is much smaller, although edible. The\nfibre is derived from the stem, and the plant attains the height of\nfifteen or twenty feet. The usual mode of preparing the hemp is to cut\noff the stem near the ground, before the time or just when the fruit\nis ripe. The stem is then eight or ten feet long below the leaves,\nwhere it is again cut. The outer coating of the herbaceous stem\nis then stripped off, until the fibers or cellular parts are seen,\nwhen it undergoes the process of rotting, and after being well dried\nin houses and sheds, is prepared for market by assorting it, a task\nwhich is performed by the women and children. That which is intended\nfor cloth is soaked for an hour or two in weak lime-water prepared\nfrom sea-shells, again dried, and put up in bundles. From all the\ndistricts in which it grows, it is sent to Manila, which is the only\nport whence it can legally be exported. It arrives in large bundles,\nand is packed there, by means of a screw-press, in compact bales,\nfor shipping, secured by rattan, each weighing two piculs.",
        "The best Manila hemp ought to be white, dry, and of a long and fine\nfiber. This is known at Manila by the name of lupis; the second\nquality they call bandala.",
        "The exportation has much increased within the last few years, in\nconsequence of the demand for it in the United States; and the whole\ncrop is now monopolized by the two American houses of Sturges & Co.,\nand T. N. Peale & Co., of Manila, who buy all of good quality that\ncomes to market. This is divided between the two houses, and the\nprice they pay is from four to five dollars the picul. The entire\nquantity raised in 1840 was eighty-three thousand seven hundred and\nninety piculs; in 1841, eighty-seven thousand.",
        "The quantity exported to the United States in 1840, was sixty-eight\nthousand two hundred and eighty piculs, and in 1841, only sixty-two\nthousand seven hundred piculs; its value in Manila is about three\nhundred thousand dollars. Twenty thousand piculs go to Europe. There\nare no duties on its exportation.",
        "That which is brought to the United States is principally manufactured\nin or near Boston, and is the cordage known as “white rope.” The\ncordage manufactured at Manila is, however, very superior to the\nrope made with us, although the hemp is of the inferior kind. A large\nquantity is also manufactured into mats.",
        "In the opinion of our botanist, it is not probable that the plant could\nbe introduced with success into our country, for in the Philippines\nit is not found north of latitude 14° N.",
        "[Coffee.] The coffee-plant is well adapted to these islands. A\nfew plants were introduced into the gardens of Manila, about fifty\nyears ago, since which time it has been spread all over the island,\nas is supposed by the civet-cats, which, after swallowing the seeds,\ncarry them to a distance before they are voided.",
        "The coffee of commerce is obtained here from the wild plant, and\nis of an excellent quality. Upwards of three thousand five hundred\npiculs are now exported, of which one-sixth goes to the United States.",
        "[Sugar.] The sugar-cane thrives well here. It is planted after the\nFrench fashion, by sticking the piece diagonally into the ground. Some,\nfinding the cane has suffered in times of drought, have adopted other\nmodes. It comes to perfection in a year, and they seldom have two\ncrops from the same piece of land, unless the season is very favorable.",
        "There are many kinds of cane cultivated, but that grown in the valley\nof Pampanga is thought to be the best. It is a small red variety, from\nfour to five feet high, and not thicker than the thumb. The manufacture\nof the sugar is rudely conducted; and the whole business, I was told,\nwas in the hands of a few capitalists, who, by making advances, secure\nthe whole crop from those who are employed to bring it to market. It\nis generally brought in moulds, of the usual conical shape, called\npilones, which are delivered to the purchaser from November to June,\nand contain each about one hundred and fifty pounds. On their receipt,\nthey are placed in large storehouses, where the familiar operation\nof claying is performed. The estimate for the quantity of sugar\nfrom these pilones after this process is about one hundred pounds;\nit depends upon the care taken in the process.",
        "[Cotton.] Of cotton they raise a considerable quantity, which is of a\nfine quality, and principally of the yellow nankeen. In the province\nof Ilocos it is cultivated most extensively. The mode of cleaning it\nof its seed is very rude, by means of a hand-mill, and the expense of\ncleaning a picul (one hundred and forty pounds) is from five to seven\ndollars. There have, as far as I have understood, been no endeavors\nto introduce any cotton-gins from our country.",
        "[Wages.] It will be merely necessary to give the prices at which\nlaborers are paid, to show how low the compensation is, in comparison\nwith those in our own country. In the vicinity of Manila, twelve and\na half cents per day is the usual wages; this in the provinces falls\nto six and nine cents. A man with two buffaloes is paid about thirty\ncents. The amount of labor performed by the latter in a day would\nbe the ploughing of a soane, about two-tenths of an acre. The most\nprofitable way of employing laborers is by the task, when, it is said,\nthe natives work well, and are industrious.",
        "The manner in which the sugar and other produce is brought to market\nat Manila is peculiar, and deserves to be mentioned. In some of the\nvillages, the chief men unite to build a vessel, generally a pirogue,\nin which they embark their produce, under the conduct of a few persons,\nwho go to navigate it, and dispose of the cargo. In due time they\nmake their voyage, and when the accounts are settled, the returns\nare distributed to each according to his share. Festivities are then\nheld, the saints thanked for their kindness, and blessings invoked\nfor another year. After this is over, the vessel is taken carefully\nto pieces, and distributed, among the owners, to be preserved for\nthe next season.",
        "The profits in the crops, according to estimates, vary from sixty\nto one hundred per cent.; but it was thought, as a general average,\nthat this was, notwithstanding the great productiveness of the soil,\nfar beyond the usual profits accruing from agricultural operations. In\nsome provinces this estimate would hold good, and probably be exceeded.",
        "[Indigo.] Indigo would probably be a lucrative crop, for that raised\nhere is said to be of quality equal to the best, and the crop is\nnot subject to so many uncertainties as in India: the capital and\nattention required in vats, etc., prevent it from being raised in\nany quantities. Among the productions, the bamboo and rattan ought to\nclaim a particular notice from their great utility; they enter into\nalmost every thing. Of the former their houses are built, including\nframes, floors, sides, and roof; fences are made of the same material,\nas well as every article of general household use, including baskets\nfor oil and water. The rattan is a general substitute for ropes of\nall descriptions, and the two combined are used in constructing rafts\nfor crossing ferries.",
        "I have thus given a general outline of the capabilities of this\ncountry for agricultural operations, in some of the most important\narticles of commerce; by which it will be seen that the Philippine\nIslands are one of the most favored parts of the globe.",
        "[Locusts.] The crops frequently suffer from the ravages of the locusts,\nwhich sweep all before them. Fortunately for the poorer classes, their\nattacks take place after the rice has been harvested; but the cane\nis sometimes entirely cut off. The authorities of Manila, in the vain\nhope of stopping their devastations, employ persons to gather them and\nthrow them into the sea. I understood on one occasion they had spent\neighty thousand dollars in this way, but all to little purpose. It is\nsaid that the crops rarely suffer from droughts, but on the contrary\nthe rains are thought to fall too often, and to flood the rice fields;\nthese, however, yield a novel crop, and are very advantageous to the\npoor, viz.: a great quantity of fish, which are called dalag, and are\na species of Blunnius; they are so plentiful, that they are caught\nwith baskets: these fish weigh from a half to two pounds, and some are\nsaid to be eighteen inches long; but this is not all; they are said,\nafter a deep inundation, to be found even in the vaults of churches.",
        "The Philippines are divided into thirty-one provinces, sixteen of\nwhich are on the island of Luzon, and the remainder comprise the\nother islands of the group and the Ladrones.",
        "[Population.] The population of the whole group is above three\nmillions, including all tribes of natives, mestizos, and whites. The\nlatter-named class are but few in number, not exceeding three\nthousand. The mestizos were supposed to be about fifteen or twenty\nthousand; they are distinguished as Spanish and Indian mestizos. The\nChinese have of late years increased to a large number, and it is\nsaid that there are forty thousand of them in and around Manila\nalone. One-half of the whole population belongs to Luzon. The island\nnext to it in the number of inhabitants is Panay, which contains\nabout three hundred and thirty thousand. Then come Cebu, Mindanao,\nLeyte, Samar, and Negros, varying from the above numbers down to\nfifty thousand. The population is increasing, and it is thought that\nit doubles itself in seventy years. This rate of increase appears\nprobable, from a comparison of the present population with the estimate\nmade at the beginning of the present century, which shows a growth\nin the forty years of about one million four hundred thousand.",
        "The native population is composed of a number of distinct tribes,\nthe principal of which in Luzon are Pangasinan, Ilocos, Cagayan,\nTagalog, and Pampangan.",
        "The Igorots, who dwell in the mountains, are the only natives who\nhave not been subjected by the Spaniards. The other tribes have\nbecome identified with their rulers in religion, and it is thought\nthat by this circumstance alone has Spain been able to maintain the\nascendency with so small a number, over such a numerous, intelligent,\nand energetic race as they are represented to be. This is, however,\nmore easily accounted for, from the Spaniards fostering and keeping\nalive the jealousy and hatred that existed at the time of the discovery\nbetween the different tribes.",
        "It seems almost incredible that Spain should have so long persisted\nin the policy of allowing no more than one galleon to pass annually\nbetween her colonies, and equally so that the nations of Europe should\nhave been so long deceived in regard to the riches and wealth that\nSpain was monopolizing in the Philippines. The capture of Manila,\nin 1762, by the English, first gave a clear idea of the value of this\nremote and little-known appendage of the empire.",
        "The Philippines, considered in their capacity for commerce, are\ncertainly among the most favored portions of the globe, and there is\nbut one circumstance that tends in the least degree to lessen their\napparent advantage; this is the prevalence of typhoons in the China\nseas, which are occasionally felt with force to the north of latitude\n10° N. South of that parallel, they have never been known to prevail,\nand seldom so far; but from their unfailing occurrence yearly in some\npart of the China seas, they are looked for with more or less dread,\nand cause each season a temporary interruption in all the trade that\npasses along the coast of these islands.",
        "The army is now composed entirely of native troops, who number about\nsix thousand men, and the regiments are never suffered to serve in\nthe provinces in which they are recruited, but those from the north\nare sent to the south, and vice versa. There they are employed to keep\nup a continual watch on each other; and, speaking different dialects,\nthey never become identified.",
        "They are, indeed, never allowed to remain long enough in one region,\nto imbibe any feelings in unison with those of its inhabitants. The\nhostility is so great among the regiments, that mutinies have occurred,\nand contests arisen which have produced even bloodshed, which it was\nentirely out of the power of the officers to prevent. In cases of\nthis kind, summary punishment is resorted to.",
        "[Conditions not peaceful.] Although the Spaniards, as far as is known\nabroad, live in peace and quiet, this is far from being the case; for\nrebellion and revolts among the troops and tribes are not unfrequent in\nthe provinces. During the time of our visit one of these took place,\nbut it was impossible to learn anything concerning it that could\nbe relied upon, for all conversation respecting such occurrences\nis interdicted by the government. The difficulty to which I refer\nwas said to have originated from the preaching of a fanatic priest,\nwho inflamed them to such a degree that they overthrew the troops\nand became temporarily masters of the country. Prompt measures were\nimmediately taken, and orders issued to give the rebels no quarter;\nthe regiments most hostile to those engaged in the revolt were ordered\nto the spot; they spared no one; the priest and his companions were\ntaken, put to death, and according to report, in a manner so cruel as\nto be a disgrace to the records of the nineteenth century. Although I\nshould hope the accounts I heard of these transactions were incorrect,\nyet the detestation these acts were held in, would give some color\nto the statements.",
        "The few gazettes that are published at Manila are entirely under the\ncontrol of the government; and a resident of that city must make\nup his mind to remain in ignorance of the things that are passing\naround him, or believe just what the authorities will allow to be\ntold, whether truth or falsehood. The government of the Philippines\nis emphatically an iron rule: how long it can continue so, is doubtful.",
        "[The governor-general.] One of my first duties was to make an\nofficial call upon His Excellency Don Marcelino Oroa, who is the\nsixty-first governor of the Philippine Islands. According to the\nestablished etiquette, Mr. Moore, the vice-consul, announced our\ndesire to do so, and requested to be informed of the time when we\nwould be received. This was accordingly named, and at the appointed\nhour we proceeded to the palace in the city proper. On our arrival,\nwe were announced and led up a flight of steps, ample and spacious,\nbut by no means of such splendor as would indicate the residence of\nvice-royalty. The suite of rooms into which we were ushered were so\ndark that it was difficult to see. I made out, however, that they were\npanelled, and by no means richly furnished. His excellency entered\nfrom a side-door, and led us through two or three apartments into his\nprivate audience-room, an apartment not quite so dark as those we\nhad come from: our being conducted to this, I was told afterwards,\nwas to be considered an especial mark of respect to my country. His\nreception of us was friendly. The governor has much more the appearance\nof an Irishman than of a Spaniard, being tall, portly, of a florid\ncomplexion. He is apparently more than sixty years of age. He was\ndressed in a full suit of black, with a star on his breast.",
        "Mr. Moore acted as interpreter, and the governor readily acceded to my\nrequest to be allowed to send a party into the interior for a few days;\na permission which I almost despaired of receiving, for I knew that\nhe had refused a like application some few months before. The refusal,\nhowever, I think was in part owing to the character of the applicants,\nand the doubtful object they had in view. I impute the permission we\nreceived to the influence of our consul, together with Mr. Sturges,\nwhose agreeable manners, conciliatory tone, and high standing with\nthe authorities, will, I am satisfied, insure us at all times every\nreasonable advantage or facility.",
        "The term of the governor in office is three years, and the present\nincumbent was installed in 1841. This length of time is thought to be\nsufficient for any one of them to make a fortune. The office is held\nby the appointment of the ministry in Spain, and with it are connected\nperquisites that are shared, it is said, by those who confer them.",
        "After having paid our respects to his excellency, we drove to visit\nseveral other officers of the government, who received us without\nceremony. We generally found them in loose morning-gowns, smoking, and\ncigars were invariably offered us; for this habit appears in Manila to\nextend to all ranks. Even in the public offices of the custom-house\nit was the fashion, and cigars, with a machero for striking a light,\nor a joss-stick kept burning, were usually seen in every apartment.",
        "[Courteous Spanish officials.] To the captain of the port, Don Juan\nSalomon, I feel under many obligations for his attentions. I was\ndesirous of obtaining information relative to the Sulu Seas, and to\nlearn how far the Spanish surveys had been carried. He gave me little\nhopes of obtaining any; but referred me to Captain Halcon, of the\nSpanish Navy, who had been employed surveying some part of the coast\nof the islands to the north. The latter whom I visited, on my making\nthe inquiry of him, and stating the course I intended to pursue,\nfrankly told me that all the existing charts were erroneous. He\nonly knew enough of the ground to be certain that they were so,\nand consequently useless. He advised my taking one of the native\npilots, who were generally well acquainted with the seas that lay\nmore immediately in my route. The captain of the port was afterwards\nkind enough to offer to procure me one.",
        "The intercourse I had with these gentlemen was a source of much\ngratification, and it gives me great pleasure to make this public\nexpression of it. To both, my sincere acknowledgments are due for\ninformation in relation to the various reefs and shoals that have\nbeen recently discovered, and which will be found placed in their\ntrue position on our charts.",
        "During our stay at Manila, our time was occupied in seeing sights,\nshopping, riding, and amusing ourselves with gazing on the throng\nincessantly passing through the Escolta of the Binondo suburb, or\nmore properly, the commercial town of Manila.",
        "[Cigar factories.] Among the lions of the place, the great royal cigar\nmanufactories claim especial notice from their extent and the many\npersons employed. There are two of these establishments, one situated\nin the Binondo quarter, and the other on the great square or Prado;\nin the former, which was visited by us, there are two buildings of\ntwo stories high, besides several storehouses, enclosed by a wall,\nwith two large gateways, at which sentinels are always posted. The\nprincipal workshop is in the second story, which is divided into six\napartments, in which eight thousand females are employed. Throughout\nthe whole extent, tables are arranged, about sixteen inches high,\nten feet long, and three feet wide, at each of which fifteen women\nare seated, having small piles of tobacco before them. The tables are\nset crosswise from the wall, leaving a space in the middle of the room\nfree. The labor of a female produces about two hundred cigars a day;\nand the working hours are from 6 a.m., till 6 p.m., with a recess of\ntwo hours, from eleven till one o’clock. The whole establishment is\nkept very neat and clean, and every thing appears to be carried on\nin the most systematic and workmanlike manner. Among such numbers,\nit has been found necessary to institute a search on their leaving\nthe establishment to prevent embezzlement, and this is regularly\nmade twice a day, without distinction of sex. It is a strange sight\nto witness the ingress and egress of these hordes of females; and\nprobably the world cannot elsewhere exhibit so large a number of ugly\nwomen. Their ages vary from fifteen to forty-five. The sum paid them\nfor wages is very trifling. The whole number of persons employed in the\nmanufactories is about fifteen thousand; this includes the officers,\nclerks, overseers, etc.",
        "As nearly as I could ascertain, the revenue derived from these\nestablishments is half a million of dollars.",
        "The natives of the Philippines are industrious. They manufacture an\namount of goods sufficient to supply their own wants, particularly\nfrom Panay and Ilocos. These for the most part consist of cotton and\nsilks, and a peculiar article called piña. The latter is manufactured\nfrom a species of Bromelia (pineapple), and comes principally\nfrom the island of Panay. The finest kinds of piña are exceedingly\nbeautiful, and surpass any other material in its evenness and beauty\nof texture. Its color is yellowish, and the embroidery is fully\nequal to the material. It is much sought after by all strangers,\nand considered as one of the curiosities of this group. Various\nreports have been stated of the mode of its manufacture, and among\nothers that it was woven under water, which I found, upon inquiry,\nto be quite erroneous. The web of the piña is so fine, that they\nare obliged to prevent all currents of air from passing through the\nrooms where it is manufactured, for which purpose there are gauze\nscreens in the windows. After the article is brought to Manila, it\nis then embroidered by girls; this last operation adds greatly to\nits value. We visited one of the houses where this was in progress,\nand where the most skilful workwomen are employed.",
        "On mounting the stairs of bamboos, every step we took produced its\ncreak; but, although the whole seemed but a crazy affair, yet it did\nnot want for strength, being well and firmly bound together. There\nwere two apartments, each about thirteen by twenty-five feet, which\ncould be divided by screens, if required. At the end of it were seen\nabout forty females, all busily plying their needles, and so closely\nseated as apparently to incommode each other. The mistress of the\nmanufactory, who was quite young, gave us a friendly reception, and\nshowed us the whole process of drawing the threads and working the\npatterns, which, in many cases, were elegant.",
        "A great variety of dresses, scarfs, caps, collars, cuffs, and\npocket-handkerchiefs, were shown us. These were mostly in the rough\nstate, and did not strike us with that degree of admiration which was\nexpected. They, however, had been in hand for six months, and were\nsoiled by much handling; but when others were shown us in the finished\nstate, washed and put up, they were such as to claim our admiration.",
        "I was soon attracted by a very different sight at the other end of the\napartment. This was a dancing-master and his scholar, of six years old,\nthe daughter of the woman of the house. It was exceedingly amusing\nto see the airs and graces of this child.",
        "For music they had a guitar; and I never witnessed a ballet that\ngave me more amusement, or saw a dancer that evinced more grace,\nease, confidence, and decided talent, than did this little girl. She\nwas prettily formed, and was exceedingly admired and applauded by us\nall. Her mother considered her education as finished, and looked on\nwith all the admiration and fondness of parental affection.",
        "On inquiry, I found that the idea of teaching her to read and write had\nnot yet been entertained. Yet every expense is incurred to teach them\nto use their feet and arms, and to assume the expression of countenance\nthat will enable them to play a part in the afterscenes of life.",
        "This manufactory had work engaged for nine months or a year in\nadvance. The fabric is extremely expensive, and none but the wealthy\ncan afford it. It is also much sought after by foreigners. Even orders\nfor Queen Victoria and many of the English nobility were then in hand;\nat least I so heard at Manila. Those who are actually present have,\nnotwithstanding, the privilege of selecting what they wish to purchase;\nfor, with the inhabitants here, as elsewhere, ready money has too\nmuch attraction for them to forego the temptation.",
        "Time in Manila seems to hang heavily on the hands of some of its\ninhabitants; their amusements are few, and the climate ill adapted to\nexertion. The gentlemen of the higher classes pass their morning in\nthe transaction of a little public business, lounging about, smoking,\netc. In the afternoon, they sleep, and ride on the Prado; and in the\nevening, visit their friends, or attend a tertulia. The ladies are to\nbe pitied; for they pass three-fourths of their time in déshabillé,\nwith their maids around them, sleeping, dressing, lolling, and combing\ntheir hair. In this way the whole morning is lounged away; they neither\nread, write, nor work. In dress they generally imitate the Europeans,\nexcept that they seldom wear stockings, and go with their arms bare. In\nthe afternoon they ride on the Prado in state, and in the evening\naccompany their husbands. Chocolate is taken early in the morning,\nbreakfast at eleven, and dinner and supper are included in one meal.",
        "Mothers provide for the marriage of their daughters; and I was told\nthat such a thing as a gentleman proposing to any one but the mother,\nor a young lady engaging herself, is unknown and unheard of. The\nnegotiation is all carried forward by the mother, and the daughter is\ngiven to any suitor she may deem a desirable match. The young ladies\nare said to be equally disinclined to a choice themselves, and if\nproposals were made to them, the suitor would be at once referred to\nthe mother. Among the lower orders it is no uncommon thing for the\nparties to be living without the ceremony of marriage, until they have\na family and no odium whatever is attached to such a connexion. They\nare looked upon as man and wife, though they do not live together; and\nthey rarely fail to solemnize their union when they have accumulated\nsufficient property to procure the requisite articles for housekeeping.",
        "[The Luneta.] Three nights in each week they have music in the plaza,\nin front of the governor’s palace, by the bands of four different\nregiments, who collect there after the evening parade. Most of the\nbetter class resort here, for the pleasure of enjoying it. We went\nthither to see the people as well as to hear the music. This is the\ngreat resort of the haut ton, who usually have their carriages in\nwaiting, and promenade in groups backwards and forwards during the\ntime the music is playing. This is by far the best opportunity that\none can have for viewing the society of Manila, which seems as easy\nand unrestrained as the peculiar gravity and ceremonious mode of\nintercourse among the old Spaniards can admit. Before the present\ngovernor took office, it had been the custom to allow the bands to\nplay on the Prado every fine evening, when all the inhabitants could\nenjoy it until a late hour; but he has interdicted this practice,\nand of course given much dissatisfaction; he is said to have done\nthis in a fit of ill temper, and although importuned to restore this\namusement to the common people, he pertinaciously refuses.",
        "The bands of the regiments are under the direction of Frenchmen and\nSpaniards: the musicians are all natives, and play with a correct ear.",
        "Our afternoons were spent in drives on the Prado, where all the\nfashion and rank of Manila are to be met, and where it is exceedingly\nagreeable to partake of the fresh and pure air after a heated day in\nthe city. The extreme end of the Prado lies along the shore of the bay\nof Manila, having the roadstead and ships on one side, and the city\nproper with its fortifications and moats on the other. This drive\nusually lasts for an hour, and all sorts of vehicles are shown off,\nfrom the governor’s coach and six, surrounded by his lancers, to the\nsorry chaise and limping nag. The carriage most used is a four-wheeled\nbiloche, with a gig top, quite low, and drawn by two horses, on one\nof which is a postilion; these vehicles are exceedingly comfortable\nfor two persons. The horses are small, but spirited, and are said\nto be able to undergo great fatigue, although their appearance\ndoes not promise it. This drive is enlivened by the music of the\ndifferent regiments, who are at this time to be seen manoeuvering on\nthe Prado. The soldiers have a very neat and clean appearance; great\nattention is paid to them, and the whole are well appointed. The force\nstationed in Manila is six thousand, and the army in the Philippines\namounts to twenty thousand men. The officers are all Spaniards,\ngenerally the relations and friends of those in the administration\nof the government. The pay of the soldiers is four dollars a month,\nand a ration, which is equal to six cents a day. As troops I was told,\nthey acquitted themselves well. The Prado is laid out in many avenues,\nleading in various directions to the suburbs, and these are planted\nwith wild almond trees, which afford a pleasant shade. It is well kept,\nand creditable to the city.",
        "In passing the crowds of carriages very little display of female\nbeauty is observed, and although well-dressed above, one cannot but\nrevert to their wearing no stockings beneath.",
        "On the Prado is a small theatre, but so inferior that the building\nscarce deserves the name: the acting was equally bad. This amusement\nmeets with little encouragement in Manila and, I was told, was\ndiscountenanced by the Governor.",
        "[A tertulia.] I had the pleasure during our stay of attending a\ntertulia in the city. The company was not a large one, comprising\nsome thirty or forty ladies and about sixty gentlemen. It resembled\nthose of the mother country. Dancing was introduced at an early hour,\nand continued till a few minutes before eleven o’clock, at which\ntime the gates of the city are always shut. It was amusing to see\nthe sudden breaking up of the party, most of the guests residing out\nof the city. The calling for carriages, shawls, hats, etc., produced\nfor a few minutes great confusion, every one being desirous of getting\noff at the earliest moment possible, for fear of being too late. This\nregulation, by which the gates are closed at so early an hour, does\nnot appear necessary, and only serves to interrupt the communication\nbetween the foreign and Spanish society as the former is obliged, as\nbefore observed, to live outside of the city proper. This want of free\nintercourse is to be regretted, as it prevents that kind of friendship\nby which many of their jealousies and prejudices might be removed.",
        "The society at this tertulia was easy, and so far as the enjoyment\nof dancing went, pleasant; but there was no conversation. The\nrefreshments consisted of a few dulces, lemonade, and strong drinks\nin an anteroom. The house appeared very spacious and well adapted for\nentertainments, but only one of the rooms was well lighted. From the\nnovelty of the scene, and the attentions of the gentleman of the house,\nwe passed a pleasant evening.",
        "The natives and mestizos attracted much of my attention at\nManila. Their dress is peculiar: over a pair of striped trousers\nof various colors, the men usually wear a fine grass-cloth shirt,\na large straw hat, and around the head or neck a many colored silk\nhandkerchief. They often wear slippers as well as shoes. The Chinese\ndress, as they have done for centuries, in loose white shirts and\ntrousers. One peculiarity of the common men is their passion for\ncock-fighting; and they carry these fowls wherever they go, after a\npeculiar fashion under their arm.",
        "[Cock-figghting.] Cock-fighting is licensed by the government, and\ngreat care is taken in the breeding of game fowls, which are very large\nand heavy birds. They are armed with a curved double-edged gaff. The\nexhibitions are usually crowded with half-breeds or mestizos, who are\ngenerally more addicted to gambling than either the higher or lower\nclasses of Spaniards. It would not be an unapt designation to call\nthe middling class cock-fighters, for their whole lives seem to be\ntaken up with the breeding and fighting of these birds. On the exit\nfrom a cockpit, I was much amused with the mode of giving the return\ncheck, which was done by a stamp on the naked arm, and precludes\nthe possibility of its transfer to another person. The dress of the\nlower order of females is somewhat civilized, yet it bore so strong\na resemblance to that of the Polynesians as to recall the latter\nto our recollection. A long piece of colored cotton is wound round\nthe body, like the pareu, and tucked in at the side: this covers\nthe nether limbs; and a jacket fitting close to the body is worn,\nwithout a shirt. In some, this jacket is ornamented with work around\nthe neck; it has no collar, and in many cases no sleeves, and over\nthis a richly embroidered cape. The feet are covered with slippers,\nwith wooden soles, which are kept on by the little toe, only four toes\nentering the slipper, and the little one being on the outside. The\neffect of both costumes is picturesque.",
        "[Ducks.] The market is a never failing place of amusement to a\nforeigner, for there a crowd of the common people is always to be seen,\nand their mode of conducting business may be observed. The canals\nhere afford great facilities for bringing vegetables and produce to\nmarket in a fresh state. The vegetables are chiefly brought from the\nshores of the Laguna de Bay, through the river Pasig. The meat appeared\ninferior, and as in all Spanish places the art of butchering is not\nunderstood. The poultry, however, surpasses that of any other place\nI have seen, particularly in ducks, the breeding of which is pursued\nto a great extent. Establishments for breeding these birds are here\ncarried on in a systematic manner, and are a great curiosity. They\nconsist of many small enclosures, each about twenty feet by forty or\nfifty, made of bamboo, which are placed on the bank of the river,\nand partly covered with water. In one corner of the enclosure is a\nsmall house, where the eggs are hatched by artificial heat, produced\nby rice-chaff in a state of of fermentation. It is not uncommon to see\nsix or eight hundred ducklings all of the same age. There are several\nhundreds of these enclosures, and the number of ducks of all ages\nmay be computed at millions. The manner in which they are schooled\nto take exercise, and to go in and out of the water, and to return\nto their house, almost exceeds belief. The keepers or tenders are of\nthe Tagalog tribe, who live near the enclosures, and have them at all\ntimes under their eye. The old birds are not suffered to approach\nthe young, and all of one age are kept together. They are fed upon\nrice and a small species of shell-fish that is found in the river\nand is peculiar to it. From the extent of these establishments we\ninferred that ducks were the favorite article of food at Manila, and\nthe consumption of them must be immense. The markets are well supplied\nwith chickens, pigeons, young partridges, which are brought in alive,\nand turkeys. Among strange articles that we saw for sale, were cakes\nof coagulated blood. The markets are well stocked with a variety of\nfish, taken both in the Laguna and bay of Manila, affording a supply\nof both the fresh and salt water species, and many smaller kinds that\nare dried and smoked. Vegetables are in great plenty, and consist\nof pumpkins, lettuce, onions, radishes, very long squashes, etc.;\nof fruits, they have melons, chicos, durians, marbolas, and oranges.",
        "[Fish.] Fish are caught in weirs, by the hook, or in seines. The former\nare constructed of bamboo stakes, in the shallow water of the lake,\nat the point where it flows through the Pasig river. In the bay,\nand at the mouth of the river, the fish are taken in nets, suspended\nby the four corners from hoops attached to a crane, by which they are\nlowered into the water. The fishing-boats are little better than rafts,\nand are called sarabaos.",
        "The usual passage-boat is termed banca, and is made of a single\ntrunk. These are very much used by the inhabitants. They have a\nsort of awning to protect the passenger from the rays of the sun;\nand being light are easily rowed about, although they are exceedingly\nuncomfortable to sit in, from the lowness of the seats, and liable to\noverset, if the weight is not placed near the bottom. The outrigger\nwas very often dispensed with, owing to the impediment it offered to\nthe navigation of their canals; these canals offer great facilities\nfor the transportation of burdens; the banks of almost all of them\nare faced with granite. Where the streets cross them, there are\nsubstantial stone bridges, which are generally of no more than one\narch, so as not to impede the navigation. The barges used for the\ntransportation of produce resemble our canal-boats, and have sliding\nroofs to protect them from the rain.",
        "Water, for the supply of vessels, is brought off in large earthen\njars. It is obtained from the river, and if care is not taken, the\nwater will be impure; it ought to be filled beyond the city. Our\nsupply was obtained five or six miles up the river, by a lighter,\nin which were placed a number of water-casks. It proved excellent.",
        "The trade of Manila extends to all parts of the world.",
        "There are many facilities for the transaction of business, as far as\nthe shipment of articles is concerned; but great difficulties attend\nthe settling of disputed accounts, collecting debts, etc., in the\nway of which the laws passed in 1834 have thrown many obstacles. All\ncommercial business of this kind goes before, first, the Junta\nde Comercio, and then an appeal to the Tribunal de Comercio. This\nappeal, however, is merely nominal; for the same judges preside in\neach, and they are said to be susceptible of influences that render\nan appeal to them by honest men at all times hazardous. The opinion\nof those who have had the misfortune to be obliged to recur to these\ntribunals is, that it is better to suffer wrong than encounter both\nthe expense and vexation of a resort to them for justice. In the\nfirst of these courts the decision is long delayed, fees exacted,\nand other expenses incurred; and when judgment is at length given,\nit excites one party or the other to appeal: other expenses accrue\nin consequence, and the advocates and judges grow rich while both the\nlitigants suffer. I understood that these tribunals were intended to\nsimplify business, lessen the time of suits, and promote justice; but\nthese results have not been obtained, and many believe that they have\nhad the contrary effect, and have opened the road to further abuses.",
        "[Environs.] The country around Manila, though no more than an extended\nplain for some miles, is one of great interest and beauty, and affords\nmany agreeable rides on the roads to Santa Ana and Mariquina. Most of\nthe country-seats are situated on the Pasig river; they may indeed\nbe called palaces, from their extent and appearance. They are built\nupon a grand scale, and after the Italian style, with terraces,\nsupported by strong abutments, decked with vases of plants. The\ngrounds are ornamented with the luxuriant, lofty, and graceful trees\nof the tropics; these are tolerably well kept. Here and there fine\nlarge stone churches, with their towers and steeples, are to be seen,\nthe whole giving the impression of a wealthy nobility, and a happy\nand flourishing peasantry.",
        "[The cemetery.] In one of our rides we made a visit to the Campo Santo\nor cemetery, about four miles from Manila. It is small, but has many\nhandsome trees about it; among them was an Agati, full of large white\nflowers, showing most conspicuously. The whole place is as unlike a\ndepository of the dead as it well can be. Its form is circular, having\na small chapel, in the form of a rotunda, directly opposite the gate,\nor entrance. The walls are about twenty feet high, with three tiers of\nniches, in which the bodies are enclosed with quicklime. Here they are\nallowed to remain for three years, or until such time as the niches\nmay be required for further use. Niches may be purchased, however,\nand permanently closed up; but in the whole cemetery there were but\nfive thus secured. This would seem to indicate an indifference on the\npart of the living, for their departed relatives or friends; at least\nsuch was my impression at the time. The center of the enclosure is laid\nout as a flower-garden and shrubbery, and all the buildings are washed\na deep buff-color, with white cornices; these colors, when contrasted\nwith the green foliage, give an effect that is not unpleasing. In\nthe chapel are two tombs, the one for the bishop, and the other for\nthe governor. The former, I believe, is occupied, and will continue\nto be so, until another shall follow him; but the latter is empty,\nfor, since the erection of the cemetery, none of the governors have\ndied. In the rear of the chapel is another small cemetery, called Los\nAngeles; and, further behind, the Osero. The former is similar to the\none in front, but smaller, and appropriated exclusively to children;\nthe latter is an open space, where the bones of all those who have\nbeen removed from the niches, after three years, are east out, and\nnow lie in a confused heap, with portions of flesh and hair adhering\nto them. No person is allowed to be received here for interment,\nuntil the fees are first paid to the priest, however respectable the\nparties may be; and all those who pay the fees, and are of the true\nfaith, can be interred. I was told of a corpse of a very respectable\nperson being refused admittance, for the want of the priest’s pass,\nto show that the claim had been satisfied, and the coffin stopped\nin the road until it was obtained. We ourselves witnessed a similar\nrefusal. A servant entered with a dead child; borne on a tray, which\nhe presented to the sacristan to have interred, the latter asked him\nfor the pass, which not being produced, he was dismissed, nor was he\nsuffered to leave his burden until this requisite could be procured\nfrom the priest, who lived opposite. The price of interment was three\ndollars, but whether this included the purchase of the niche, or its\nrent for the three years only, I did not learn.",
        "The churches of Manila can boast of several fine-toned bells, which\nare placed in large belfries or towers. There was one of these towers\nnear the Messrs. Sturges’, where we stayed; and the manner in which\nthe bell was used, when swung around by the force of two or three men,\nattracted our attention; for the ringers occasionally practised feats\nof agility by passing over with the bell, and landing on the coping on\nthe opposite side. The tower being open, we could see the manoeuver\nfrom the windows, and, as strangers, went there to look on. One day,\nwhilst at dinner, they began to ring, and as many of the officers\nhad not witnessed the fact, they sought the windows. This excited\nthe vanity of those in the belfry, who redoubled their exertions,\nand performed the feat successfully many times, although in some\ninstances they narrowly escaped accident, by landing just within\nthe outside coping. This brought us all to the window, and the next\nturn, more force having been given to the bell, the individual who\nattempted the feat was thrown headlong beyond the tower, and dashed\nto pieces on the pavement beneath. Although shocked at the accident,\nI felt still more so when, after a few minutes, the bell was again\nheard making its usual sound, as if nothing had occurred to interrupt\nthe course of its hourly peals.",
        "[Monasteries.] In company with Dr. Tolben, I visited one of the\nconvents where he attended on some of the monks who were sick; he\nseemed well acquainted with them all. I was much struck with the extent\nof the building, which was four stories high, with spacious corridors\nand galleries, the walls of which were furnished with pictures\nrepresenting the martyrdom of the Dominican friars in Japan. These were\nabout seventy in number, in the Chinese style of art, and evidently\npainted by some one of that nation, calling himself an artist. From\nappearances, however, I should think they were composed by the priests,\nwho have not a little taxed their invention to find out the different\nmodes in which a man can be put to death. Many evidently, if not all,\nhad been invented for the pictures. So perplexed had they apparently\nbeen, that in one of the last it was observed that the executioner\nheld his victim at arms’ length by the heels, and was about to let him\ndrop headforemost into a well. From the galleries we passed into the\nlibrary, and thence into many of the rooms, and finally we mounted to\nthe top of the monastery, which affords a beautiful view of the bay,\ncity, and suburbs. There I was presented to three of the friars,\nwho were pleasant and jolly-looking men. Upon the roof was a kind\nof observatory, or look-out, simply furnished with billiard-tables\nand shuffleboards, while the implements for various other games lay\nabout on small tables, with telescopes on stands, and comfortable\narm-chairs. It was a place where the friars put aside their religious\nand austere character or appearance, and sought amusement. It was\na delightful spot, so far as coolness and the freshness of the sea\nair were concerned, and its aspect gave me an insight behind the\ncurtain of these establishments that very soon disclosed many things\nI was ignorant of before. All the friars were of a rotund form,\nand many of them bore the marks of good living in their full, red,\nand bloated faces. It seems to be generally understood at Manila,\nthat they live upon the fat of the land. We visited several of the\nrooms, and were warmly greeted by the padres, one of whom presented\nme with a meteorological table for the previous year.",
        "The revenues of all these religious establishments are considerable;\nthe one I visited belonged to the Dominicans, and was very rich. Their\nrevenues are principally derived from lands owned by them, and the\ntithes from the different districts which they have under their charge,\nto which are added many alms and gifts. On inquiry, I found their\ngeneral character was by no means thought well of, and they had of\nlate years lost much of the influence that they possessed before the\nrevolution in the mother country.",
        "Among the inhabitants we saw here, was a native boy of the Igorots,\nor mountain tribe. He is said to be a true Negrito. (Another confusion\nof facts.–C.)",
        "[Mountaineers.] The Spaniards, as has been stated, have never been\nable to subdue this tribe, who are said to be still as wild as on\ntheir first landing; they are confined almost altogether to the plains\nwithin or near the mountains, and from time to time make inroads in\ngreat force on the outer settlements, carrying off as much plunder\nas possible. The burden of this often causes them to be overtaken\nby the troops. When overtaken, they fight desperately, and were it\nnot for the fire-arms of their adversaries, would give them much\ntrouble. Few are captured on such occasions, and it is exceedingly\ndifficult to take them alive, unless when very young. These mountains\nfurnish them with an iron ore almost pure, in manufacturing which\nthey show much ingenuity. Some of their weapons were presented to\nthe Expedition by Josiah Moore, Esq. These are probably imitations\nof the early Spanish weapons used against them. From all accounts,\nthe natives are of Malay origin, and allied to those of the other\nislands of the extensive archipelago of the Eastern Seas; but the\npopulation of the towns and cities of the island are so mixed,\nfrom the constant intercourse with Chinese, Europeans, and others,\nthat there is no pure blood among them. When at Manila, we obtained a\ngrammar of the Tagalog language, which is said to be now rarely heard,\nand to have become nearly obsolete. This grammar is believed to be the\nonly one extant, and was procured from a padre, who presented it to the\nExpedition. (Tagalog is here mistaken for a mountaineer’s dialect.–C.)",
        "The Pampangans are considered the finest tribe of natives; they are\nexcessively fond of horse-racing, and bet very considerable sums upon\nit; they have the reputation of being an industrious and energetic\nset of men.",
        "[Revenue.] The mode of raising revenue by a poll-tax causes great\ndiscontent among all classes, for although light, it is, as it always\nhas been elsewhere, unpopular. All the Chinese pay a capitation tax\nof four dollars. The revenue from various sources is said to amount\nto one million six hundred thousand dollars, of which the poll-tax\namounts to more than one-half, the rest being derived from the customs,\ntobacco, etc. There is no tax upon land. It was thought at Manila\nthat a revenue might be derived by indirect taxation, far exceeding\nthis sum, without being sensibly felt by the inhabitants. This mode\nis employed in the eastern islands under the English and Dutch rule,\nand it is surprising that the Spaniards also do not adopt it, or some\nother method to increase resources that are so much needed. Whenever\nthe ministry in Spain had to meet a claim, they were a few years\nago in the habit of issuing drafts on this colonial government in\npayment. These came at last in such numbers, that latterly they have\nbeen compelled to suspend the payment of them.",
        "The revenue of the colonial government is very little more than will\nmeet the expenses; and it is believed that, notwithstanding these\nunaccepted claims, it received orders to remit the surplus, if any,\nto Spain, regardless of honor or good faith.",
        "[Government.] The government of the Philippines is in the hands of a\ngovernor-general, who has the titles of viceroy, commander-in-chief,\nsub-delegate, judge of the revenue from the post-office, commander of\nthe troops, captain-general, and commander of the naval forces. His\nduties embrace every thing that relates to the security and defence\nof the country. As advisers, he has a council called the Audiencia.",
        "The islands are divided into provinces, each of which has a\nmilitary officer with the title of governor, appointed by the\ngovernor-general. They act as chief magistrates, have jurisdiction\nover all disputes of minor importance, have the command of the troops\nin time of war, and are collectors of the royal revenues, for the\nsecurity of which they give bonds, which must be approved of by the\ncomptroller-general of the treasury. The province of Cavite is alone\nexempt from this rule, and the collection of tribute is there confided\nto a police magistrate.",
        "Each province is again sub-divided into pueblos, containing a greater\nor less number of inhabitants, each of which has again its ruler,\ncalled a gobernadorcillo, who has in like manner other officers under\nhim to act as police magistrates. The number of the latter are very\ngreat, each of them having his appropriate duties. These consist in the\nsupervision of the grain fields, coconut groves, betel-nut plantations,\nand in the preservation of the general order and peace of the town. So\nnumerous are these petty officers, that there is scarcely a family of\nany consequence, that has not a member who holds some kind of office\nunder government. This policy, in case of disturbances, at once\nunites a large and influential body on the side of the government,\nthat is maintained at little expense. The gobernadorcillo exercises\nthe municipal authority, and is especially charged to aid the parish\npriest in every thing appertaining to religious observances, etc.",
        "In the towns where the descendants of the Chinese are sufficiently\nnumerous, they can, by permission of the governor, elect their own\npetty governors and officers from among themselves.",
        "In each town there is also a headman (cabeza de barangay), who has\nthe charge of fifty tributaries, in each of which is included as\nmany families. This division is called a barangay. This office forms\nby far the most important part of the machinery of government in the\nPhilippine Islands, for these headmen are the attorneys of these small\ndistricts, and become the electors of the gobernadorcillos, and other\ncivil officers. Only twelve, however, of them or their substitutes,\nare allowed to vote in each town.",
        "The office of head-man existed before the conquest of the island,\nand the Spaniards showed their wisdom in continuing and adapting it to\ntheir system of police. The office among the natives was hereditary,\nbut their conquerors made it also elective, and when a vacancy now\noccurs through want of heirs, or resignation, it is filled up by\nthe superintendent of the province, on the recommendation of the\ngobernadorcillo and the headman. This is also the case when any new\noffice is created. The privileges of the headmen are great; themselves,\ntheir wives, and their first-born children, are exempted from paying\ntribute to the crown, an exoneration which is owing to their being\ncollectors of the royal revenues. Their duties consist in maintaining\ngood order and harmony, in dividing the labor required for the public\nbenefit equally, adjusting differences, and receiving the taxes.",
        "The gobernadorcillo takes cognizance of all civil cases not exceeding\ntwo taels of gold, or forty-four dollars in silver; all criminal\ncases must be sent to the chief of the province. The headmen formerly\nserved for no more than three years, and if this was done faithfully,\nthey became and were designated as principals, in virtue of which\nrank they received the title of Don.",
        "The election takes place at the court-house of the town; the electors\nare the gobernadorcillo whose office is about to expire, and twelve\nof the oldest headmen, cabezas de barangay, collectors of tribute\nfor the gobernadorcillo they must select, by a plurality of votes,\nthree individuals, who must be able to speak, read, and write the\nSpanish language. The voting is done by ballot, in the presence\nof the notary (escribano), and the chief of the province, who\npresides. The curate may be present, to look after the interest of\nthe church but for no other purpose. After the votes are taken, they\nare sealed and transmitted to the governor-general, who selects one\nof the three candidates, and issues a commission. In the more distant\nprovinces, the chief of the district has the authority to select the\ngobernadorcillo, and fill up the commission, a blank form of which,\nsigned by the governor-general, is left with him for that purpose.",
        "The headmen may be elected petty governors, and still retain their\noffice, and collect the tribute or taxes; for it is not considered\njust, that the important office of chief of Barangay should deprive\nthe holder of the honor of being elected gobernadorcillo.",
        "The greater part of the Chinese reside in the province of Tondo,\nbut the tribute is there collected by the alcalde mayor, with an\nassistant taken from among the officers of the royal treasury.",
        "The poll-tax on the Chinese amounts to four dollars a head; it was\nformerly one-half more. Tax-lists of the Chinese are kept, in which\nthey are registered and classified; and opposite the name is the\namount at which the individual is assessed.",
        "The Spanish government seems particularly desirous of giving\nconsequence even to its lowest offices; and in order to secure it to\nthem, it is directed that the chiefs of provinces, shall treat the\ngobernadorcillos with respect, offering them seats when they enter\ntheir houses or other places, and not allowing them to remain standing;\nfurthermore, the parish curates are required to treat them with\nequal respect. So far as concerns the provinces, the government may\nbe called, notwithstanding the officers, courts. etc., monastic. The\npriests rule, and frequently administer punishment, with their own\nhands, to either sex, of which an instance will be cited hereafter.",
        "[A country excursion.] As soon as we could procure the necessary\npassports, which were obligingly furnished by the governor to “Don\nRussel Sturges y quatro Anglo Americanos,” our party left Manila\nfor a short jaunt to the mountains. It was considered as a mark of\ngreat favor on the part of his excellency to grant this indulgence,\nparticularly as he had a few months prior denied it to a party of\nFrench officers. I was told that he preferred to make it a domestic\nconcern, by issuing the passport in the name of a resident, in order\nthat compliance in this case might not give umbrage to the French. It\nwas generally believed that the cause of the refusal in the former\ninstance was the imprudent manner in which the French officers went\nabout taking plans and sketches, at the corners of streets, etc., which\nin the minds of an unenlightened and ignorant colonial government, of\ncourse excited suspicion. Nothing can be so ridiculous as this system\nof passports; for if one was so disposed, a plan, and the most minute\ninformation of every thing that concerns the defences of places, can\nalways be obtained at little cost now-a-days; for such is the skill of\nengineers, that a plan is easily made of places, merely by a sight of\nthem. We were not, however, disposed to question the propriety of the\ngovernor’s conduct in the former case, and I left abundantly obliged\nto him for a permission that would add to our stock of information.",
        "It was deemed at first impossible for the party to divide, as they\nhad but one passport, and some difficulties were anticipated from\nthe number being double that stated in the passport. The party\nconsisted of Messrs. Sturges, Pickering, Eld, Rich, Dana, and\nBrackenridge. Mr. Sturges, however, saw no difficulty in dividing the\nparty after they had passed beyond the precincts of the city, taking\nthe precaution, at the same time, not to appear together beyond the\nnumber designated on the paper.",
        "On the 14th, they left Manila, and proceeded in carriages to Santa Ana,\non the Pasig, in order to avoid the delay that would ensue if they\nfollowed the windings of the river in a banca, and against the current.",
        "At Santa Ana they found their bancas waiting for them, and\nembarked. Here the scene was rendered animated by numerous boats of\nall descriptions, from the parao to the small canoe of a single log.",
        "There is a large population that live wholly on the water: for the\npadrones of the parao have usually their families with them, which,\nfrom the great variety of ages and sexes, give a very different and\nmuch more bustling appearance to the crowd of boats, than would be the\ncase if they only contained those who are employed to navigate them. At\ntimes the paraos and bancas, of all sizes, together with the saraboas\nand pativas (duck establishments), become jumbled together, and create\na confusion and noise such as is seldom met with in any other country.",
        "[Duck farms.] The pativas are under the care of the original\ninhabitants, to whom exclusively the superintendence of the ducklings\nseems to be committed. The pens are made of bamboo, and are not\nover a foot high. The birds were all in admirable order, and made no\nattempt to escape over the low barrier, although so light that it was\nthought by some of our gentlemen it would not have sufficed to confine\nAmerican ducks, although their wings might have been cut. The mode of\ngiving them exercise was by causing them to run round in a ring. The\ngood understanding existing between the keepers and their charge was\nstriking, particularly when the former were engaged in cleansing the\npens, and assisting the current to carry off the impurities. In the\ncourse of their sail, it was estimated that hundreds of thousands of\nducks of all ages were seen.",
        "The women who were seen were usually engaged in fishing with a hook\nand line, and were generally standing in the water, or in canoes. The\nsaraboas were here also in use. The run of the fish is generally\nconcentrated by a chevaux-de-frise to guide them towards the nets\nand localities where the fishermen place themselves.",
        "At five o’clock they reached the Laguna de Bay, where they took in a\nnew crew, with mast and sail. This is called twenty-five miles from\nManila by the river; the distafice in a bird’s flight is not over\ntwelve. The whole distance is densely peopled, and well cultivated. The\ncrops consist of indigo, rice, etc., with groves of the betel, palm,\ncoconut, and quantities of fruit trees.",
        "The shores of the lake are shelving, and afford good situations\nfor placing fish-weirs, which are here established on an extensive\nscale. These weirs are formed of slips of bamboo, and are to be seen\nrunning in every direction to the distance of two or three miles. They\nmay be said to invest entirely the shores of the lake for several miles\nfrom its outlet, and without a pilot it would be difficult to find the\nway through them. At night, when heron and tern were seen roosting on\nthe top of each slat, these weirs presented rather a curious spectacle.",
        "The Laguna de Bay is said to be about ten leagues in length by three in\nwidth, and trends in a north-northwest and south-southeast direction.",
        "After dark, the bancas separated. Mr. Sturges, with Dr. Pickering\nand Mr. Eld, proceeded to visit the mountain of Maijaijai,\nwhile Messrs. Rich, Dana, and Brackenridge, went towards the Taal\nVolcano. The latter party took the passport, while the former relied\nupon certain letters of introduction for protection, in case of\ndifficulty.",
        "Mr. Sturges, with his party, directed his course to the east side\nof the lake, towards a point called Jalajala, which they reached\nabout three o’clock in the morning, and stopped for the crew to cook\nsome rice, etc. At 8 o’clock a.m., they reached Santa Cruz, situated\nabout half a mile up a small streamlet, called Paxanau. At this place\nthey found Don Escudero to whom they had a letter of introduction,\nand who holds a civil appointment. They were kindly received by this\ngentleman and his brown lady, with their interesting family. He at\nonce ordered horses for them to proceed to the mission of Maijaijai,\nand entertained them with a sumptuous breakfast.",
        "They were not prepared to set out before noon, until which time they\nstrolled about the town of Santa Cruz, the inhabitants of which\nare Tagalogs. There are only two old Spaniards in the place. The\nprovince in which Santa Cruz is situated contains about five thousand\ninhabitants, of whom eighteen hundred pay tribute.",
        "The people have the character of being orderly, and govern themselves\nwithout the aid of the military. The principal article of culture is\nthe coconut tree, which is seen in large groves. The trunks of these\nwere notched, as was supposed, for the purpose of climbing them. From\nthe spathe a kind of spirit is manufactured, which is fully as strong\nas our whiskey.",
        "About noon they left Don Escudero’s, and took a road leading to the\nsouthward and eastward, through a luxuriant and beautiful country,\nwell cultivated, and ornamented with lofty coconut trees, betel\npalms, and banana groves. Several beautiful valleys were passed,\nwith streamlets rushing through them.",
        "Maijaijai is situated about one thousand feet above the Laguna de Bay,\nbut the rise is so gradual that it was almost imperceptible. The\ncountry has everywhere the appearance of being densely peopled;\nbut no more than one village was passed between Santa Cruz and the\nmission. They had letters to F. Antonio Romana y Aranda, padre of\nthe mission, who received them kindly, and entertained them most\nhospitably. [Climbing Banajao.] When he was told of their intention\nto visit the mountain, he said it was impossible with such weather,\npointing to the black clouds that then enveloped its summit; and he\nendeavoured to persuade the gentlemen to desist from what appeared\nto him a mad attempt; but finding them resolved to make the trial,\nhe aided in making all the necessary preparations, though he had no\nbelief in their success.",
        "On the morning of the 27th, after mass, Mr. Eld and Dr. Pickering\nset out, but Mr. Sturges preferred to keep the good padre company\nuntil their return. The padre had provided them with guides, horses,\ntwenty natives, and provisions for three days. He had been himself\non the same laborious journey, some six months before, and knew its\nfatigues, although it turned out afterwards that his expedition was\nperformed in fine weather, and that he had been borne on a litter by\nnatives the whole way.",
        "The first part of the road was wet and miry, and discouraging\nenough. The soil was exceedingly rich, producing tropical plants\nin great profusion, in the midst of which were seen the neat bamboo\ncottages, with their industrious and cleanly-looking inhabitants. When\nthey reached the foot of the mountain, they found it was impossible to\nride farther, and were obliged to take to walking, which was, however,\nless of a hardship than riding the little rats of horses, covered with\nmud and dirt, which were at first deemed useless; but the manner in\nwhich they ascended and maintained themselves on the slippery banks,\nsurpassed anything they had before witnessed in horseflesh. The first\npart of the ascent of the mountain was gradual, but over a miry path,\nwhich was extremely slippery; and had it not been for the sticks stuck\ndown by the party of the padre in their former ascent, they would have\nfound it extremely difficult to overcome; to make it more disagreeable,\nit rained all the time.",
        "It took about two hours to reach the steep ascent. The last portion\nof their route had been through an uninhabited region, with some\nopenings in the woods, affording pasture-grounds to a few small herds\nof buffalo. In three hours they reached the half-way house, by a very\nsteep and regular ascent. Here the natives insisted upon stopping\nto cook their breakfast, as they had not yet partaken of anything\nthrough the day. The natives now endeavored to persuade them it was\nimpracticable to go any farther, or at least to reach the top of the\nmountain and return before night. Our gentlemen lost their patience at\nthe delay, and after an hour’s endurance of it, resolved to set out\nalone. Six of the natives followed them, and by half-past three they\nreached the summit, where they found it cold and uncomfortable. The\nascent had been difficult, and was principally accomplished by catching\nhold of shrubs and the roots of trees. The summit is comparatively\nbare, and not more than fifty feet in width. The side opposite to\nthat by which they mounted was perpendicular, but owing to the thick\nfog they could not see the depth to which the precipice descended.",
        "The observations with the barometers were speedily taken, which gave\nthe height of Banajao as six thousand five hundred feet. The trees\non the summit were twenty or thirty feet high, and a species of\nfir was very common. Gaultheria, attached to the trunks of trees,\nRhododendrons, and Polygonums, also abounded. The rocks were so\ncovered with soil that it was difficult to ascertain their character;\nDr. Pickering is of opinion, however, that they are not volcanic. The\nhouse on the summit afforded them little or no shelter; being a mere\nshed, open on all sides, they found it untenantable, and determined\nto return as soon as their observations were finished, to the half-way\nhouse, which they reached before dark.",
        "The night was passed uncomfortably, and in the morning they made\nan early start down the mountain to reach the native village at its\nfoot, where they were refreshed with a cup of chocolate, cakes, and\nsome dulces, according to the custom of the country. At ten o’clock\nthey reached the mission, where they were received by the padre and\nMr. Sturges. The former was greatly astonished to hear that they\nhad really been to the summit, and had accomplished in twenty-four\nhours what he had deemed a labor of three days. He quickly attended\nto their wants, the first among which was dry clothing; and as their\nbaggage had unfortunately been left at Santa Cruz, the wardrobe of\nthe rotund padre was placed at their disposal. Although the fit was\nrather uncouth on the spare forms of our gentlemen, yet his clothes\nserved the purpose tolerably well, and were thankfully made use\nof. During their absence, Mr. Sturges had been much amused with the\ndiscipline he had witnessed at the hands of the church, which here\nseem to be the only visible ruling power. Two young natives had made\ncomplaint to the padre that a certain damsel had entered into vows\nor engagements to marry both; she was accordingly brought up before\nthe padre, Mr. Sturges being present. The padre first lectured her\nmost seriously upon the enormity of her crime, then inflicted several\nblows on the palm of her outstretched hand, again renewing the lecture,\nand finally concluding with another whipping. The girl was pretty, and\nexcited the interest of our friend, who looked on with much desire to\ninterfere, and save the damsel from the corporal punishment, rendered\nmore aggravated by the dispassionate and cool manner in which it and\nthe lecture were administered. In the conversation which ensued, the\npadre said he had more cases of the violation of the marriage vow,\nand of infidelity, than any other class of crimes.",
        "After a hearty breakfast, or rather dinner, and expressing their\nthanks to the padre, they rode back to Santa Cruz, where they arrived\nat an early hour, and at nine o’clock in the evening they embarked\nin their bancas for Manila.",
        "[Los Baños.] In the morning they found themselves, after a comfortable\nnight, at Los Baños. Here they took chocolate with the padre, to whom\nMr. Sturges had a letter, who informed them that the other party had\nleft the place the evening before for Manila.",
        "This party had proceeded to the town of Baia, where they arrived at\ndaylight on the 15th. Baia is quite a pretty place, and well situated;\nthe houses are clean and comfortable, and it possessed a venerable\nstone church, with towers and bells. On inquiring for the padre,\nthey found that he was absent, and it was in consequence impossible\nfor them to procure horses to proced to the Volcano of Taal. They\ntherefore concluded to walk to the hot springs at Los Baños, about\nfive miles distant. Along the road they collected a number of curious\nplants. Rice is much cultivated, and fields of it extend to some\ndistance on each side of the road. Buffaloes were seen feeding and\nwallowing in the ditches.",
        "At Los Baños the hot springs are numerous, the water issuing from the\nrock over a considerable surface. The quantity of water discharged\nby them is large, and the whole is collected and conducted to the\nbathing-houses. The temperature of the water at the mouth of the\nculvert was 180°.",
        "The old bath-house is a singular-looking place, being built on the\nhill-side, in the old Spanish style, with large balconies, that are\nenclosed in the manner already described, in speaking of the houses\nin Manila. It is beautifully situated, and overlooks the baths and\nlake. The baths are of stone, and consist of two large rooms, in\neach of which is a niche, through which the hot water passes. This\nbuilding is now in ruins, the roof and floors having fallen in.",
        "Los Baños is a small village, but contains a respectable-looking\nstone church, and two or three houses of the same material. Here the\nparty found a difficulty in getting on, for the alcalde could not\nspeak Spanish, and they were obliged to use an interpreter, in order\nto communicate with him. Notwithstanding this, he is a magistrate,\nwhose duty it is to administer laws written in that language. Finding\nthey could not succeed even here in procuring guides or horses,\nthey determined to remain and explore Mount Maquiling, the height\nof which is three thousand four hundred and fifty feet, and in the\nmeantime to send for their bancas.",
        "The next day they set out on their journey to that mountain, and the\nfirst part of their path lay over a gentle ascent, through cultivated\ngrounds. Next succeeded an almost perpendicular hill, bare of trees,\nand overgrown with a tall grass, which it was difficult to pass\nthrough.",
        "Such had been the time taken up, that the party found it impossible\nto reach the summit and return before dark. They therefore began\nto collect specimens; and after having obtained a full load, they\nreturned late in the afternoon to Los Baños.",
        "The mountain is composed of trachytic rocks and tufa, which are\noccasionally seen to break through the rich and deep soil, showing\nthemselves here and there, in the deep valleys which former volcanic\naction has created, and which have destroyed the regular outline\nof the cone-shaped mountain. The tufa is generally found to form\nthe gently-sloping plains that surround these mountains, and has in\nall probability been ejected from them. Small craters, of some two\nhundred feet in height, are scattered over the plains. The tufa is\nlikewise exposed to view on the shores of the lake; but elsewhere,\nexcept on a few bare hills, it is entirely covered with the dense\nand luxuriant foliage. The tufa is generally of a soft character,\ncrumbling in the fingers, and in it are found coarse and fine fragments\nof scoria, pumice, etc. The layers are from a few inches to five feet\nin thickness.",
        "In the country around Los Baños, there are several volcanic hills, and\non the sides of Mount Maquiling are appearances of parasitic cones,\nsimilar to those observed at the Hawaiian Islands; but time and the\nfoliage have so disguised them, that it is difficult to determine\nexactly their true character.",
        "I regretted exceedingly that the party that set out for the Lake of\nTaal was not able to reach it, as, from the accounts I had, it must\nbe one of the most interesting portions of the country. It lies nearly\nsouth-west from Manila, and occupies an area of about one hundred and\ntwenty square miles. The Volcano of Taal is situated on an island\nnear the center of it, and is now in action. The cone which rises\nfrom its center is remarkably regular, and consists for the most part\nof cinders and scoria. It has been found to be nine hundred feet in\nelevation above the lake. The crater has a diameter of two miles,\nand its depth is equal to the elevation; the walls of the crater\nare nearly perpendicular, so much so that the descent cannot be\nmade without the assistance of ropes. At the bottom there are two\nsmall cones. Much steam issues from the many fissures, accompanied\nby sulphurous acid gas. The waters of the lake are impregnated with\nsulphur, and there are said to be also large beds of sulphur. In\nthe opinion of those who have visited this spot, the whole lake once\nformed an immense crater; and this does not appear very improbable,\nif we are to credit the accounts we received of the many craters\non this island that are now filled with water; for instance, in the\nneighborhood of San Pablo there are said to be eight or nine.",
        "[The hot springs.] The hot springs of Los Baños are numerous, and in\ntheir vicinity large quantities of steam are seen to issue from the\nshore of the lake. There are about a dozen which give out a copious\nsupply of water. The principal one has been enclosed, and made\nto flow through a stone aqueduct, which discharges a considerable\nstream. The temperature of the water as it leaves the aqueduct is\n178°. The villagers use it for cooking and washing; the signs of the\nformer employment are evident enough from the quantities of feathers\nfrom the poultry that have been scalded and plucked preparatory to\ncooking. The baths are formed by a small circular building six feet\nin diameter, erected over the point of discharge for the purpose of\nsecuring a steam-bath; the temperature of these is 160° and 140°. A\nchange of temperature is said to have occurred in the latter.",
        "The rocks in the vicinity are all tufa, and some of the springs break\nout close to the cold water of the lake. Near the aqueduct, a stone\nwall surrounds one of the principal outlets. Two-thirds of the area\nthus enclosed is occupied by a pond of warm water, and the other third\nis divided into two stone reservoirs, built for baths. These baths\nhad at one time a high reputation, and were a very fashionable resort\nfor the society of Manila; but their celebrity gradually diminished,\nand the whole premises have gone out of repair, and are fast falling\nto ruin.",
        "The water of the springs has no perceptible taste, and only a very\nfaint smell of sulphur is perceived. No gas escapes from it, but a\nwhite incrustation covers the stones over which the water flows.",
        "Some of these waters were obtained, and since our return were put into\nthe hands of Dr. C. T. Jackson, of Boston, who gives the following\nanalysis:",
        "Specific gravity, 1.0043; thermometer 60°; barometer 30.05 in.",
        "A quantity of the water, equal in bulk to three thousand grains of\ndistilled water, on evaporation gave–",
        "Dry salts, 5.95 grains.",
        "A quantity of the water, equal in bulk to one thousand grains of\ndistilled water, was operated on for each of the following ingredients:",
        "    Chlorine            0.66\n    Carbonic acid       0.16\n    Sulphuric acid      0.03\n    Soda and sodium     0.97\n    Magnesia            0.09\n    Lime                0.07\n    Potash              traces\n    Organic matter        ,,\n    Manganese             ,,\n                        ––\n                        1.98",
        "[Mount Maquiling.] On Mount Maquiling, wild buffaloes, hogs, a small\nspecies of deer, and monkeys are found. Birds are also very numerous,\nand among them is the horn-bill; the noise made by this bird resembles\na loud barking; report speaks of them as an excellent bird for the\ntable. Our gentlemen reached their lodging-place as the night closed\nin, and the next day again embarked for Manila, regretting that\ntime would not permit them to make another visit to so interesting\na field of research. They found the lake so rough that they were\ncompelled to return, and remain until eight o’clock. This, however,\ngave our botanists another opportunity of making collections, among\nwhich were beautiful specimens of Volkameria splendens, with elegant\nscarlet flowers, and a Brugmansia, which expanded its beautiful\nsilvery flowers after sunset. On the shores a number of birds were\nfeeding, including pelicans, with their huge bills, the diver, with\nits long arched neck, herons, gulls, eagles, and snow-white cranes,\nwith ducks and other small aquatic flocks. Towards night these were\njoined by large bats, that were seen winging their way towards the\nplantations of fruit. These, with quantities of insects, gave a vivid\nidea of the wonderful myriads of animated things that are constantly\nbrought into being in these tropical and luxuriant climates.",
        "Sailing all night in a rough sea, they were much incommoded by the\nwater, which was shipped into the banca and kept them constantly baling\nout: they reached the Pasig river at daylight, and again passed the\nduck establishments, and the numerous boats and bancas on their way\nto the markets of Manila.",
        "Both the parties reached the consul’s the same day, highly pleased with\ntheir respective jaunts. To the kindness of Messrs. Sturges and Moore,\nwe are mainly indebted for the advantages and pleasures derived from\nthe excursions.",
        "The instruments were now embarked, and preparations made for going\nto sea. Our stay at Manila had added much to our collections; we\nobtained many new specimens, and the officers and naturalists had\nbeen constantly and profitably occupied in their various duties.",
        "We went on board on January 20, and were accompanied to the vessel\nby Messrs. Sturges and Moore, with several other residents of Manila.",
        "We had, through the kindness of Captain Salomon, procured a native\npilot for the Sulu Sea, who was to act as interpreter.",
        "On the morning of the 21st, we took leave of our friends, and got\nunder way. The same day, and before we had cleared the bay, we spoke\nthe American ship Angier, which had performed the voyage from the\nUnited States in one hundred and twenty-four days, and furnished us\nwith late and interesting news. We then, with a strong northerly wind,\nmade all sail to the south for the Straits of Mindoro.",
        "Sulu in 1842",
        "On the evening of January 21, the Vincennes, with the tender in\ncompany, left Manila bay. I then sent for Mr. Knox, who commanded\nthe latter, and gave him directions to keep closely in company with\nthe Vincennes, and at the same time pointed out to him places of\nrendezvous where the vessels might again meet in case any unavoidable\ncircumstance caused their separation. I was more particular in giving\nhim instructions to avoid losing sight of the Vincennes, as I was aware\nthat my proposed surveys might be impeded or frustrated altogether,\nwere I deprived of the assistance of the vessel under his command.",
        "[Mindoro.] On the 22nd, we passed the entrance of the Straits of San\nBernardino. It would have been my most direct route to follow these\nstraits until I had passed Mindoro, and it is I am satisfied the safest\ncourse, unless the winds are fair, for the direct passage. My object,\nhowever, was to examine the ground for the benefit of others, and the\nApo Shoal, which lies about mid-channel between Palawan and Mindoro,\nclaimed my first attention. The tender was despatched to survey it,\nwhile I proceeded in the Vincennes to examine the more immediate\nentrance to the Sulu Sea, off the southwest end of Mindoro.",
        "Calavite Peak is the north point of Mindoro, and our observations\nmade it two thousand feet high. This peak is of the shape of a\ndome, and appears remarkably regular when seen from its western\nside. On approaching Mindoro, we, as is usual, under high islands,\nlost the steady breeze, and the wind became light for the rest of\nthe day. Mindoro is a beautiful island, and is evidently volcanic;\nit appears as if thrown up in confused masses; it is not much settled,\nas the more southern islands are preferred to it as a residence.",
        "On the 23rd, we ascertained the elevation of the highest peak of\nthe island by triangulation to be three thousand one hundred and\ntwenty-six fet. The easternmost island of the Palawan group, Busuanga,\nwas at the time just in sight from the deck, to the southwest.",
        "It had been my intention to anchor at Ambolou Island; but the wind\ndied away before we reached it, and I determined to stand off and on\nall night.",
        "On the 24th, I began to experience the truth of what Captain Halcon had\nasserted, namely, that the existing charts were entirely worthless,\nand I also found that my native pilot was of no more value than\nthey were, he had evidently passed the place before; but whether\nthe size of the vessel, so much greater than any he had sailed in,\nconfused him, or whether it was from his inability to understand and\nto make himself understood by us, he was of no use whatever, and we\nhad the misfortune of running into shoal water, barely escaping the\nbottom. These dangers were usually quickly passed, and we soon found\nourselves again floating in thirty or forty fathoms water.",
        "We continued beating to windward, in hopes of being joined by the\nFlying-fish, and I resolved to finish the survey towards the island\nof Semarara. We found every thing in a different position from that\nassigned it by any of the charts with which we were furnished. On\nthis subject, however, I shall not dwell, but refer those who desire\nparticular information to the charts and Hydrographical Memoir.",
        "Towards evening, I again ran down to the southwest point of the island\nof Mindoro, and sent a letter on shore to the pueblo, with directions\nto have it put on board the tender, when she should arrive. We then\nbegan to beat round Semarara, in order to pass over towards Panay.",
        "The southern part of Mindoro is much higher than the northern\nbut appears to be equally rough. It is, however, susceptible of\ncultivation, and there are many villages along its shores.",
        "Semarara is moderately high, and about fifteen miles in circumference;\nit is inhabited, and like Mindoro much wooded. According to the native\npilot, its shores are free from shoals. It was not until the next day\nthat we succeeded in reaching Panay. I determined to pass the night\noff Point Potol, the north end of Panay, as I believed the sea in its\nneighborhood to be free of shoals, and wished to resume our running\nsurvey early in the morning.",
        "[Panay.] At daylight on the 27th we continued the survey down the\ncoast of Panay, and succeeded in correcting many errors in the\nexisting charts (both English and Spanish). The channel along this\nside is from twelve to twenty miles wide, and suitable for beating\nin; little current is believed to exist; and the tides, as far as\nour observations went, seem to be regular and of little strength.",
        "The island of Panay is high and broken, particularly on the south\nend; its shores are thickly settled and well cultivated. Indigo and\nsugar-cane claim much of the attention of the inhabitants. The natives\nare the principal cultivators. They pay to government a capitation tax\nof seven reals. Its population is estimated at three hundred thousand,\nwhich I think is rather short of the actual number.",
        "On all the hills there are telegraphs of rude construction, to give\ninformation of the approach of piratical prahus from Sulu, which\nformerly were in the habit of making attacks upon the defenceless\ninhabitants and carrying them off into slavery. Of late years they have\nceased these depredations, for the Spaniards have resorted to a new\nmode of warfare. Instead of pursuing and punishing the offenders, they\nnow intercept all their supplies, both of necessaries and luxuries;\nand the fear of this has had the effect to deter pirates from their\nusual attacks.",
        "We remained off San Pedro for the night, in hopes of falling in with\nthe Flying-fish in the morning.",
        "On the morning of the 28th, the Flying-fish was discovered plainly in\nsight. I immediately stood for her, fired a gun and made signal. At\nseven o’clock, another gun was fired, but the vessel still stood off,\nand was seen to make sail to the westward without paying any regard\nwhatever to either, and being favored by a breeze while the Vincennes\nwas becalmed, she stole off and was soon out of sight. [270]",
        "After breakfast we opened the bay of Antique, on which is situated the\ntown of San José. As this bay apparently offered anchorage for vessels\nbound up this coast, I determined to survey it; and for this purpose\nthe boats were hoisted out and prepared for surveying. Lieutenant\nBudd was despatched to visit the pueblo called San José.",
        "On reaching the bay, the boats were sent to different points of it,\nand when they were in station, the ship fired guns to furnish bases\nby the sound, and angles were simultaneously measured. The boats made\nsoundings on their return to the ship, and thus completed this duty,\nso that in an hour or two afterwards the bay was correctly represented\non paper. It offers no more than a temporary anchorage for vessels,\nand unless the shore is closely approached, the water is almost too\ndeep for the purpose.",
        "[San José.] At San José a Spanish governor resides, who presides over\nthe two pueblos of San Pedro and San José, and does the duty also\nof alcalde. Lieutenant Budd did not see him, as he was absent, but\nhis lady did the honors. Lieutenant Budd represented the pueblo as\ncleanly and orderly. About fifteen soldiers were seen, who compose\nthe governor’s guard, and more were said to be stationed at San\nPedro. A small fort of eight guns commands the roadstead. The beach\nwas found to be of fine volcanic sand, composed chiefly of oxide of\niron, and comminuted shells; there is here also a narrow shore reef\nof coral. The plain bordering the sea is covered with a dense growth\nof coconut trees. In the fine season the bay is secure, but we were\ninformed that in westerly and southwesterly gales heavy seas set in,\nand vessels are not able to lie at anchor. Several small vessels were\nlying in a small river about one and a half miles to the southward of\nthe point on which the fort is situated. The entrance to this river\nis very narrow and tortuous.",
        "Panay is one of the largest islands of the group. We had an opportunity\nof measuring the height of some of its western peaks or highlands,\nnone of which exceed three thousand feet. The interior and eastern side\nhave many lofty summits, which are said to reach an altitude of seven\nthousand five hundred feet; but these, as we passed, were enveloped\nin clouds, or shut out from view by the nearer highlands. The general\nfeatures of the island are like those of Luzon and Mindoro. The few\nspecimens we obtained of its rocks consisted of the different varieties\nof talcose formation, with quartz and jasper. The specimens were of\nno great value, as they were much worn by lying on the beach.",
        "The higher land was bare of trees, and had it not been for the\nnumerous fertile valleys lying between the sharp and rugged spurs,\nit would have had a sterile appearance.",
        "The bay of Antique is in latitude 10° 40’ N., longitude 121° 59’\n30’’ E.",
        "It was my intention to remain for two or three days at a convenient\nanchorage to enable us to make short excursions into the interior;\nbut the vexatious mismanagement of the tender now made it incumbent\nthat I should make every possible use of the time to complete the\noperations connected with the hydrography of this sea; for I perceived\nthat the duties which I intended should be performed by her, would now\ndevolve upon the boats, and necessarily expose both officers and men to\nthe hazard of contracting disease. I regretted giving up this design,\nnot only on my own account and that of the Expedition, but because of\nthe gratification it would have afforded personally to the naturalists.",
        "The town of San José has about thirty bamboo houses, some of which\nare filled in with clay or mortar, and plastered over, both inside\nand out. Few of them are more than a single story in height. That of\nthe governor is of the same material, and overtops the rest; it is\nwhitewashed, and has a neat and cleanly appearance. In the vicinity of\nthe town are several beautiful valleys, which run into the mountains\nfrom the plain that borders the bay. The landing is on a bamboo bridge,\nwhich has been erected over an extensive mud-flat, that is exposed at\nlow water, and prevents any nearer approach of boats. This bridge is\nabout seven hundred feet in length; and a novel plan has been adopted\nto preserve it from being carried away. The stems of bamboo not\nbeing sufficiently large and heavy to maintain the superstructure in\nthe soft mud, a scaffold is constructed just under the top, which is\nloaded with blocks of large stone, and the outer piles are secured to\nanchors or rocks, with grass rope. The roadway or top is ten feet wide,\ncovered with split bamboo, woven together, and has rails on each side,\nto assist the passenger. This is absolutely necessary for safety;\nand even with this aid, one unaccustomed to it must be possessed\nof no little bodily strength to pass over this smooth, slippery,\nand springy bridge, without accident.",
        "Two pirogues were at anchor in the bay, and on the shore was the\nframe of a vessel which had evidently been a long while on the stocks,\nfor the weeds and bushes near the keel were six or eight feet high,\nand a portion of the timbers were decayed. Carts and sleds drawn by\nbuffaloes were in use, and everything gave it the appearance of a\nthriving village. Although I have mentioned the presence of soldiers,\nit was observed on landing that no guard was stationed about or even at\nthe fort; but shortly afterwards a soldier was seen hurrying towards\nthe latter, in the act of dressing himself in his regimentals, and\nanother running by his side, with his cartridge-box and musket. In\na little while one was passing up and down on his post, as though he\nwas as permanent there as the fort itself.",
        "After completing these duties, the light airs detained us the remainder\nof the day under Panay, in sight of the bay. On the 29th, at noon,\nwe had been wafted by it far enough in the offing to obtain the\neasterly breeze, which soon became strong, with an overcast sky,\nand carried us rapidly on our course; my time would not permit my\nheaving-to. We kept on our course for Mindanao during the whole night,\nand were constantly engaged in sounding, with our patent lead, with\nfrom thirty to forty fathoms cast, to prevent our passing over this\npart of the sea entirely unexamined.",
        "[Mindanao.] At daylight on the 31st, we had the island of Mindanao\nbefore us, but did not reach its western cape until 5 p.m. This island\nis high and broken, like those to the north of it, but, unlike them,\nits mountains are covered with forests to their very tops, and there\nwere no distinct cones of minor dimensions, as we had observed on\nthe others. If they do exist, they were hidden by the dense forest.",
        "I had determined to anchor at Caldera, a small port on the south-west\nside of Mindanao, about ten miles distant from Zamboanga, where the\ngovernor resides. The latter is a considerable place, but the anchorage\nin its roadstead is said to be bad, and the currents that run through\nthe Straits of Basilan are represented to be strong. Caldera, on the\nother hand, has a good, though small anchorage, which is free from the\ncurrents of the straits. It is therefore an excellent stopping-place,\nin case of the tide proving unfavorable. On one of its points stands\na small fort, which, on our arrival, hoisted Spanish colors.",
        "At six o’clock we came to anchor at Caldera, in seven fathoms\nwater. There were few indications of inhabitants, except at and\nnear the fort. An officer was despatched to the fort, to report the\nship. It was found to be occupied by a few soldiers under the command\nof a lieutenant.",
        "[Caldera fort.] The fort is about seventy feet square, and is built\nof large blocks of red coral, which evidently have not been taken from\nthe vicinity of the place, as was stated by the officers of the fort;\nfor although our parties wandered along the alluvial beach for two or\nthree miles in each direction, no signs of coral were observed. Many\nfragments of red, gray, and purple basalt and porphyry were met with\nalong the beach; talcose rock and slate, syenite, hornblend, quartz,\nboth compact and slaty, with chalcedony, were found in pieces and\nlarge pebbles. Those who were engaged in dredging reported the bottom\nas being of coral, in from four to six or eight fathoms; but this\nwas of a different kind from that of which the fort was constructed.",
        "The fort was built in the year 1784, principally for protection against\nthe Sulu pirates, who were in the habit of visiting the settlements,\nand carrying off the inhabitants as slaves, to obtain ransom for\nthem. This, and others of the same description, were therefore\nconstructed as places of refuge for the inhabitants, as well as to\nafford protection to vessels.",
        "Depredations are still committed, which render it necessary to keep\nup a small force. One or two huts which were seen in the neighborhood\nof the bay, are built on posts twenty feet from the ground, and into\nthem they ascend by ladders, which are hauled up after the occupants\nhave entered.",
        "These, it is said, are the sleeping-huts, and are so built for the\npurpose of preventing surprise at night. Before our arrival we had\nheard that the villages were all so constructed, but a visit to one\nsoon showed that this was untrue. The natives seen at the village\nwere thought to be of a decidedly lighter color and a somewhat\ndifferent expression from the Malays. They were found to be very\ncivil, and more polished in manners than our gentlemen expected. On\nasking for a drink of water, it was brought in a glass tumbler on a\nchina plate. An old woman, to whom they had presented some trifles,\ntook the trouble to meet them in another path on their return, and\ninsisted on their accepting a basket of potatoes. Some of the houses\ncontained several families, and many of them had no other means of\nentrance than a notched post stuck up to the door.",
        "The forests of Mindanao contain a great variety of trees, some of\nwhich are of large size, rising to the height of one hundred and\nand one hundred and fifty feet. Some of their trunks are shaped like\nbuttresses, similar to those before spoken of at Manila, from which\nthey obtain broad slabs for the tops of tables. The trunks were\nobserved to shoot up remarkably straight. Our botanical gentlemen,\nthough pleased with the excursion, were disappointed at not being\nable to procure specimens from the lofty trees; and the day was less\nproductive in this respect than they had anticipated. Large woody\nvines were common, which enveloped the trunks of trees in their folds,\nand ascending to their tops, prevented the collection of the most\ndesirable specimens.",
        "The paths leading to the interior were narrow and much obstructed;\none fine stream was crossed. Many buffaloes were observed wallowing\nin the mire, and the woods swarmed with monkeys and numbers of birds,\namong them the horn-bills; these kept up a continued chatter, and made\na variety of loud noises. The forests here are entirely different from\nany we had seen elsewhere; and the stories of their being the abode\nof large boas and poisonous snakes, make the effect still greater\non those who visit them for the first time. Our parties, however,\nsaw nothing of these reptiles, nor anything to warrant a belief that\nsuch exist. Yet the officer at the fort related to me many snake\nstories that seemed to have some foundation; and by inquiries made\nelsewhere, I learned that they were at least warranted by some facts,\nthough probably not to the extent that he represented.",
        "Traces of deer and wild hogs were seen, and many birds were obtained,\nas well as land and sea shells. Among the latter was the Malleus\nvulgaris, which is used as food by the natives. The soil on this\npart of the island is a stiff clay, and the plants it produces\nare mostly woody; those of an herbaceous character were scarce,\nand only a few orchideous epiphytes and ferns were seen. Around the\ndwellings in the villages were a variety of vegetables and fruits,\nconsisting of sugar-cane, sweet-potato, gourds, pumpkins, peppers,\nrice, water and musk melons, all fine and of large size.",
        "The officer at the fort was a lieutenant of infantry; one of that rank\nis stationed here for a month, after which he, with the garrison,\nconsisting of three soldiers, are relieved, from Zamboanga, where\nthe Spaniards have three companies.",
        "[Zamboanga.] Zamboanga is a convict settlement, to which the native\nrogues, principally thieves, are sent. The Spanish criminals, as I\nhave before stated in speaking of Manila, are sent to Spain.",
        "The inhabitants of the island of Mindanao, who are under the subjection\nof Spain, are about ten thousand in number, of whom five or six\nthousand are at or in the neighborhood of Zamboanga. The original\ninhabitants, who dwell in the mountains and on the east coast, are\nsaid to be quite black, and are represented to be a very cruel and\nbad set; they have hitherto bid defiance to all attempts to subjugate\nthem. When the Spaniards make excursions into the interior, which is\nseldom, they always go in large parties on account of the wild beasts,\nserpents, and hostile natives; nevertheless, the latter frequently\nattack and drive them back.",
        "The little fort is considered as a sufficient protection for the\nfishermen and small vessels against the pirates, who inhabit the\nisland of Basilan, which is in sight from Mindanao, and forms the\nsouthern side of the straits of the same name. It is said that about\nseven hundred inhabit it. The name of Moro is given by the Spaniards\nto all those who profess the Mohammedan religion, and by such all the\nislands to the west of Mindanao, and known under the name of the Sulu\narchipelago, are inhabited.",
        "The day we spent at Caldera was employed in surveying the bay, and\nin obtaining observations for its geographical position, and for\nmagnetism. The flood tide sets to the northward and westward, through\nthe straits, and the ebb to the eastward. In the bay we found it to\nrun two miles an hour by the log, but it must be much more rapid in\nthe straits.",
        "At daylight on February 1st, we got under way to stand over for\nthe Sangboys, a small island with two sharp hills on it. One and a\nhalf miles from the bay we passed over a bank, the least water on\nwhich was ten fathoms on a sandy bottom, and on which a vessel might\nanchor. The wind shortly after failed us, and we drifted with the tide\nfor some hours, in full view of the island of Mindanao, which is bold\nand picturesque. We had thus a good opportunity of measuring some of\nits mountain ranges, which we made about three thousand feet high.",
        "In the afternoon, a light breeze came from the southwest, and before\nsunset I found that we were again on soundings. As soon as we had\na cast of twenty fathoms, I anchored for the night, judging it much\nbetter than to be drifting about without any knowledge of the locality\nand currents to which we were subjected.",
        "On the morning of the 2nd, we got under way to proceed to the\nwestward. As the bottom was unequal, I determined to pass through\nthe broadest channel, although it had the appearance of being the\nshoalest, and sent two boats ahead to sound. In this way we passed\nthrough, continuing our surveying operations, and at the same time\nmade an attempt to dredge; but the ground was too uneven for the\nlatter purpose, and little of value was obtained.",
        "[Sulu.] Shortly after passing the Sangboys, we had the island of\nSulu in sight, for which I now steered direct. At sunset we found\nourselves within five or six miles of Soung Harbor; but there was not\nsufficient light to risk the dangers that might be in our course,\nnor wind enough to command the ship; and having no bottom where we\nwere, I determined again to run out to sea, and anchor on the first\nbank I should meet. At half-past eight o’clock, we struck sounding\nin twenty-six fathoms, and anchored.",
        "At daylight we determined our position by angles, and found it\nto correspond with part of the route we had passed over the day\nbefore, and that we were about fifteen miles from the large island\nof Sulu. Weighing anchor, we were shortly wafted by the westerly\ntide and a light air towards that beautiful island, which lay in the\nmidst of its little archipelago; and as we were brought nearer and\nnearer, we came to the conclusion that in our many wanderings we had\nseen nothing to be compared to this enchanting spot. It appeared to\nbe well cultivated, with gentle slopes rising here and there into\neminences from one to two thousand feet high. One or two of these\nmight be dignified with the name of mountains, and were sufficiently\nhigh to arrest the passing clouds; on the afternoon of our arrival\nwe had a singular example in the dissipation of a thunderstorm.",
        "Although much of the island was under cultivation, yet it had all the\nfreshness of a forest region. The many smokes on the hills, buildings\nof large size, cottages, and cultivated spots, together with the\nmoving crowds on the land, the prahus, canoes, and fishing-boats on\nthe water gave the whole a civilized appearance. Our own vessel lay,\nalmost without a ripple at her side, on the glassy surface of the\nsea, carried onwards to our destined anchorage by the flowing tide,\nand scarce a sound was heard except the splashing of the lead as\nit sought the bottom. The effect of this was destroyed in part by\nthe knowledge that this beautiful archipelago was the abode of a\ncruel and barbarous race of pirates. Towards sunset we had nearly\nreached the bay of Soung, when we were met by the opposing tide,\nwhich frustrated all our endeavors to reach it, and I was compelled\nto anchor, lest we should again be swept to sea.",
        "As soon as the night set in, fishermen’s lights were seen moving along\nthe beach in all directions, and gliding about in canoes, while the sea\nwas filled with myriads of phosphorescent animalcula. After watching\nthis scene for two or three hours in the calm and still night, a storm\nthat had been gathering reached us; but it lasted only for a short\ntime, and cleared off after a shower, which gave the air a freshness\nthat was delightful after the sultry heat we had experienced during\nthe day.",
        "The canoes of this archipelago were found to be different from any\nthat we had heretofore seen, not only in shape, but in making use\nof a double outrigger, which consequently must give them additional\nsecurity. The paddle also is of a different shape, and has a blade at\neach end, which are used alternately, thus enabling a single person to\nmanage them with ease. These canoes are made of a single log, though\nsome are built upon. They seldom carry more than two persons. The\nfigure on the opposite page will give a correct idea of one of them.",
        "We saw the fishermen engaged in trolling and using the line; but the\nmanner of taking fish which has been heretofore described is chiefly\npractised. In fishing, as well as in all their other employments,\nthe kris and spear were invariably by their side.",
        "[Sulu harbor.] The next morning at eight o’clock we got under way,\nand were towed by our boats into the bay of Soung, where we anchored\noff the town in nine fathoms water. While in the act of doing so,\nand after our intentions had become too evident to admit of a doubt,\nthe Sultan graciously sent off a message giving us permission to\nenter his port.",
        "Lieutenant Budd was immediately despatched with the interpreter to call\nupon the Datu Mulu or governor, and to learn at what hour we could see\nthe Sultan. When the officer reached the town, all were found asleep;\nand after remaining four hours waiting, the only answer he could get\nout of the Datu Mulu was, that he supposed that the Sultan would be\nawake at three o’clock, when he thought I could see him.",
        "During this time the boats had been prepared for surveying; and after\nlanding the naturalists, they began the work.",
        "At the appointed time, Captain Hudson and myself went on shore to wait\nupon the Sultan. On our approach to the town, we found that a great\nproportion of it was built over the water on piles, and only connected\nwith the shore by narrow bridges of bamboo. The style of building in\nSulu does not differ materially from that of the Malays. The houses\nare rather larger, and they surpass the others in filth.",
        "[Pirate craft.] We passed for some distance between the bridges to\nthe landing, and on our way saw several piratical prahus apparently\nlaid up. Twenty of these were counted, of about thirty tons burden,\nevidently built for sea-vessels, and capable of mounting one or two\nlong guns. We landed at a small streamlet, and walked a short distance\nto the Datu’s house, which is of large dimensions and rudely built on\npiles, which raise it about six feet above the ground, and into which\nwe were invited. The house of the Datu contains one room, part of which\nis screened off to form the apartment of his wife. Nearly in the center\nis a raised dais, eight or ten feet square, under which are stowed\nall his valuables, packed in chests and Chinese trunks. Upon this\ndais are placed mats for sleeping, with cushions, pillows, etc.; and\nover it is a sort of canopy, hung around with fine chintz or muslin.",
        "The dais was occupied by the Datu, who is, next to the Sultan, the\ngreatest man of this island. He at once came from it to receive us, and\nhad chairs provided for us near his sanctum. After we were seated, he\nagain retired to his lounge. The Datu is small in person, and emaciated\nin form, but has a quick eye and an intelligent countenance. He\nlives, as he told me, with all his goods around him, and they formed\na collection such as I could scarcely imagine it possible to bring\ntogether in such a place. The interior put me in mind of a barn\ninhabited by a company of strolling players. On one side were hung up\na collection of various kinds of gay dresses, here drums and gongs,\nthere swords, lanterns, spears, muskets, and small cannon; on another\nside were shields, buckler, masks, saws, and wheels, with belts, bands,\nand long robes. The whole was a strange mixture of tragedy and farce;\nand the group of natives were not far removed in appearance from the\nsupernumeraries that a Turkish tragedy might have brought together in\nthe green-room of a theatre. A set of more cowardly-looking miscreants\nI never saw. They appeared ready either to trade with us, pick our\npockets, or cut our throats, as an opportunity might offer.",
        "The wife’s apartment was not remarkable for its comforts, although\nthe Datu spoke of it with much consideration, and evidently held his\nbetter half in high estimation. He was also proud of his six children,\nthe youngest of whom he brought out in its nurse’s arms, and exhibited\nwith much pride and satisfaction. He particularly drew my attention\nto its little highly-wrought and splendidly-mounted kris, which was\nstuck through its girdle, as an emblem of his rank. He was in reality a\nfine-looking child. The kitchen was behind the house, and occupied but\na small space, for they have little in the way of food that requires\nmuch preparation. The house of the Datu might justly be termed nasty.",
        "We now learned the reason why the Sultan could not be seen; it was\nFriday, the Mahomedan Sabbath, and he had been at the mosque from\nan early hour. Lieutenant Budd had been detained, because it was not\nknown when he would finish his prayers; and the ceremonies of the day\nwere more important than usual, on account of its peculiar sanctity\nin their calendar.",
        "[Visiting the Sultan.] Word had been sent off to the ship that the\nSultan was ready to receive me, but the messenger passed us while on\nour way to shore. After we had been seated for a while, the Datu asked\nif we were ready to accompany him to see the Sultan; but intimated\nthat no one but Captain Hudson and myself could be permitted to\nlay eyes on him. Being informed that we were, he at once, and in\nour presence, slipped on his silken trousers, and a new jacket,\ncovered with bell-buttons; put on his slippers, strapped himself\nround with a long silken net sash, into which he stuck his kris, and,\nwith umbrella in hand, said he was ready. He now led the way out of\nhis house, leaving the motley group behind, and we took the path to\nthe interior of the town, towards the Sultan’s. The Datu and I walked\nhand in hand, on a roadway about ten feet wide, with a small stream\nrunning on each side. Captain Hudson and the interpreter came next,\nand a guard of six trusty slaves brought up the rear.",
        "When we reached the outskirts of the town, about half a mile from\nthe Datu’s, we came to the Sultan’s residence, where he was prepared\nto receive us in state. His house is constructed in the same manner\nas that of the Datu, but is of larger dimensions, and the piles are\nrather higher. Instead of steps, we found a ladder, rudely constructed\nof bamboo, and very crazy. This was so steep that it was necessary to\nuse the hands in mounting it. I understood that the ladder was always\nremoved in the night, for the sake of security. We entered at once\ninto the presence-chamber, where the whole divan, if such it may be\ncalled, sat in arm-chairs, occupying the half of a large round table,\ncovered with a white cotton cloth. On the opposite side of the table,\nseats were placed for us. On our approach, the Sultan and all his\ncouncil rose, and motioned us to our seats. When we had taken them,\nthe part of the room behind us was literally crammed with well-armed\nmen. A few minutes were passed in silence, during which time we\nhad an opportunity of looking at each other, and around the hall in\nwhich we were seated. The latter was of very common workmanship, and\nexhibited no signs of oriental magnificence. Overhead hung a printed\ncotton cloth, forming a kind of tester, which covered about half of\nthe apartment. In other places the roof and rafters were visible. A\npart of the house was roughly partitioned off, to the height of nine\nor ten feet, enclosing, as I was afterwards told, the Sultan’s sleeping\napartment, and that appropriated to his wife and her attendants.",
        "The Sultan is of middle height, spare and thin; he was dressed in a\nwhite cotton shirt, loose trousers of the same material, and slippers;\nhe had no stockings; the bottom of his trousers was worked in scollops\nwith blue silk, and this was the only ornament I saw about him. On his\nhead he wore a small colored cotton handkerchief, wound into a turban,\nthat just covered the top of his head. His eyes were bloodshot, and had\nan uneasy wild look, showing that he was under the effects of opium,\nof which they all smoke large quantities. His teeth were as black as\nebony, which, with his bright cherry-colored lips, [271] contrasted\nwith his swarthy skin, gave him anything but a pleasant look.",
        "On the left hand of the Sultan sat his two sons, while his right\nwas occupied by his councillors; just behind him, sat the carrier\nof his betel-nut casket. The casket was of filigree silver, about\nthe size of a small tea-caddy, of oblong shape, and rounded at the\ntop. It had three divisions, one for the leaf, another for the nut,\nand a third for the lime. Next to this official was the pipe-bearer,\nwho did not appear to be held in such estimation as the former.",
        "[Treaty with United States.] I opened the conversation by desiring\nthat the Datu would explain the nature of our visit, and tell the\nSultan that I had come to make the treaty which he had some time\nbefore desired to form with the United States. [272]",
        "The Sultan replied that such was still his desire; upon which I told\nhim I would draw one up for him that same day. While I was explaining\nto him the terms, a brass candlestick was brought in with a lighted\ntallow candle, of a very dark color, and rude shape, that showed\nbut little art in the manufacture. This was placed in the center\nof the table, with a plate of Manila cigars. None of them, however,\nwere offered to us, nor any kind of refreshment.",
        "Our visit lasted nearly an hour. When we arose to take our leave,\nthe Sultan and his divan did the same, and we made our exit with low\nbows on each side.",
        "I looked upon it as a matter of daily occurrence for all those\nwho came to the island to visit the Sultan; but the Datu Mulu took\ngreat pains to make me believe that a great favor had been granted in\nallowing us a sight of his ruler. On the other hand, I dwelt upon the\ncondescension it was on my part to visit him, and I refused to admit\nthat I was under any gratitude or obligation for the sight of His\nMajesty the Sultan Mohammed Damaliel Kisand, but said that he might\nfeel grateful to me if he signed the treaty I would prepare for him.",
        "On our return from the Sultan’s to the Datu Mulu’s house, we found\neven a greater crowd than before. The Datu, however, contrived to\nget us seats. The attraction which drew it together was to look at\nMr. Agate, who was taking a sketch of Mohammed Polalu, the Sultan’s\nson, and next heir to the throne. I had hoped to procure one of the\nSultan, but this was declared to be impossible.",
        "The son, however, has all the characteristics of the Sulu, and\nthe likeness was thought an excellent one. Mohammed Polalu is about\ntwenty-three years of age, of a tall slender figure, with a long face,\nheavy and dull eyes, as though he was constantly under the influence\nof opium. So much, indeed, was he addicted to the use of this drug,\neven according to the Datu Mulu’s accounts, that his strength and\nconstitution were very much impaired. As he is kept particularly\nunder the guardianship of the Datu, the latter has a strong interest\nin preserving this influence over him, and seems on this account to\nafford him every opportunity of indulging in this deplorable habit.",
        "During our visit, the effects of a pipe of this drug were seen upon\nhim; for but a short time after he had reclined himself on the Datu’s\ncouch and cushion, and taken a few whiffs, he was entirely overcome,\nstupid, and listless. I had never seen any one so young, bearing\nsuch evident marks of the effects of this deleterious drug. When\nbut partially recovered from its effects he called for his betelnut,\nto revive him by its exciting effects. This was carefully chewed by\nhis attendant to a proper consistency, moulded in a ball about the\nsize of a walnut, and then slipped into the mouth of the heir apparent.",
        "[Interior travel prohibited.] One of the requests I had made of the\nSultan was, that the officers might have guides to pass over the\nisland. This was at once said to be too dangerous to be attempted, as\nthe datus of the interior and southern towns would in all probability\nattack the parties. I understood what this meant, and replied that\nI was quite willing to take the responsibility, and that the party\nshould be well armed. To this the Sultan replied that he would\nnot risk his own men. This I saw was a mere evasion, but it was\ndifficult and would be dangerous for our gentlemen to proceed alone,\nand I therefore said no more. On our return to the Datu’s, I gave\nthem permission to get as far from the beach as they could, but I was\nafterwards informed by them that in endeavoring to penetrate into the\nwoods, they were always stopped by armed men. This was also the case\nwhen they approached particular parts of the town, but they were not\nmolested as long as their rambles were confined to the beach. At the\nDatu’s we were treated to chocolate and negus in gilt-edged tumblers,\nwith small stale cakes, which had been brought from Manila.",
        "After we had sat some time I was informed that Mr. Dana missed his\nbowie-knife pistol, which he had for a moment laid down on a chest. I\nat once came to the conclusion that it had been stolen, and as the\ntheft had occurred in the Datu’s house, I determined to hold him\nresponsible for it, and gave him at once to understand that I should\ndo so, informing him that the pistol must be returned before the next\nmorning, or he must take the consequences. This threw him into some\nconsternation, and by my manner he felt that I was serious.",
        "Captain Hudson and myself, previous to our return on board, visited\nthe principal parts of the town. The Chinese quarter is separated\nby a body of water, and has a gateway that leads to a bridge. The\nbridge is covered by a roof, and on each side of it are small shops,\nwhich are open in front, and thus expose the goods they contain. In\nthe rear of the shops were the dwellings of the dealers. This sort\nof bazaar contained but a very scanty assortment, and the goods were\nof inferior quality.",
        "We visited some blacksmith-shops, where they were manufacturing krises\nand spears. These shops were open sheds; the fire was made upon the\nground, and two wooden cylinders, whose valves were in the bottom,\nserved for bellows; when used, they had movable pistons, which were\nworked by a man on an elevated seat, and answered the purpose better\nthan could have been expected.",
        "The kris is a weapon in which this people take great pride; it is of\nvarious shapes and sizes, and is invariably worn from infancy to old\nage; they are generally wavy in their blades, and are worn in wooden\nscabbards, which are neatly made and highly polished.",
        "The market was well stocked with fruit and fish. Among the former the\ndurian seemed to predominate; this was the first time we had seen\nit. It has a very disagreeable odour, as if decayed, and appears\nto emit a sulphuretted hydrogen gas, which I observed blackened\nsilver. Some have described this fruit as delicious, but if the\nsmell is not enough, the taste in my opinion will convince any one\nof the contrary.",
        "Mr. Brackenridge made the following list of their fruits: Durian,\nArtocarpus integrifolia, Melons, water and musk, Oranges, mandarin\nand bitter, Pineapples, Carica papaya, Mangosteen, Bread-fruit,\nCoco and Betelnut. The vegetables were capsicums, cucumbers, yams,\nsweet-potatoes, garlic, onions, edible fern-roots, and radishes of\nthe salmon variety, but thicker and more acrid in flavor.",
        "[A stolen granite monument.] In walking about the parts of the town we\nwere permitted to enter, large slabs of cut granite were seen, which\nwere presumed to be from China, where the walls of canals or streamlets\nare lined with it. But Dr. Pickering in his rambles discovered pieces\nthat had been cut as if to form a monument, and remarked a difference\nbetween it and the Chinese kind. On one or two pieces he saw the mark\nNo. 1, in black paint; the material resembled the Chelmsford granite,\nand it occurred to him that the stone had been cut in Boston. I\ndid not hear of this circumstance until after we had left Sulu, and\nhave little doubt now that the interdiction against our gentlemen\nvisiting some parts of the town was owing to the fear they had of the\ndiscovery of this plunder. This may have been the reason why they so\nreadily complied with my demands, in order to get rid of us as soon as\npossible, feeling themselves guilty, and being unprepared for defence;\nfor, of the numerous guns mounted, few if any were serviceable.",
        "The theft of the pistol was so barefaced an affair, that I made up\nmy mind to insist on its restoration. At the setting of the watch\nin the evening, it had been our practice on board the Vincennes to\nfire a small brass howitzer. This frequently, in the calm evenings,\nproduced a great reverberation, and rolled along the water to the\nsurrounding islands with considerable noise. Instead of it, on this\nevening, I ordered one of the long guns to be fired, believing that\nthe sound and reverberation alone would suffice to intimidate such\nrobbers. One was accordingly fired in the direction of the town,\nwhich fairly shook the island, as they said, and it was not long\nbefore we saw that the rogues were fully aroused, for the clatter of\ngongs and voices that came over the water, and the motion of lights,\nconvinced me that the pistol would be forthcoming in the morning. In\nthis I was not mistaken, for at early daylight I was awakened by a\nspecial messenger from the Datu to tell me that the pistol was found,\nand would be brought off without delay; that he had been searching for\nit all night, and had at last succeeded in finding it, as well as the\nthief, on whom he intended to inflict the bastinado. Accordingly, in\na short time the pistol was delivered on board, and every expression\nof friendship and good-will given, with the strongest assurances that\nnothing of the kind should happen again.",
        "[Marongas island.] As our naturalists could have no opportunity\nof rambling over the island of Sooloo, it was thought that one\nof the neighbouring islands (although not so good a field) would\nafford them many of the same results, and that they could examine\nit unmolested. Accordingly, at an early hour, they were despatched\nin boats for that purpose, with a sufficient guard to attend them\nin case of necessity. The island on which they landed, Marongas,\nhas two hills of volcanic conglomerate and vesicular lava, containing\nangular fragments embedded. The bottom was covered with living coral,\nof every variety, and of different colors; but there was nothing like\na regular coral shelf, and the beach was composed of bits of coral\nintermixed with dead shells, both entire and comminuted. The center\nof the island was covered with mangrove-bushes; the hills were cones,\nbut had no craters on them. The mangroves had grown in clusters,\ngiving the appearance of a number of small islets. This, with the\nneighboring islands, were thought to be composed in a great part of\ncoral, but it was impossible for our gentlemen to determine the fact.",
        "The day was exceedingly hot, and the island was suffering to such\na degree from drought that the leaves in many cases were curled and\nappeared dry. On the face of the rocky cliff they saw many swallows\n(hirundo esculenta) flying in and out of the caverns facing the sea;\nbut they were not fortunate enough to find any of the edible nests,\nso much esteemed by Chinese epicures.",
        "At another part of the island they heard the crowing of a cock,\nand discovered a small village, almost hidden by the mangroves, and\nbuilt over the water. In the neighborhood were several fish-baskets\nset out to dry, as well as a quantity of fencing for weirs, all made\nof rattan. Their shape was somewhat peculiar. After a little while the\nnative fishermen were seen approaching, who evidently had a knowledge\nof their visit from the first. They came near with great caution\nin their canoes; but after the first had spoken and reconnoitered,\nseveral others landed, exhibiting no signs of embarrassment, and soon\nmotioned our party off. To indicate that force would be resorted to,\nin case of refusal, at the same time they pointed to their arms, and\ndrew their krises. Our gentlemen took this all in good part, and, after\ndispensing a few trifling presents among them, began their retreat\nwith a convenient speed, without, however, compromising their dignity.",
        "The excursion had been profitable in the way of collections, having\nyielded a number of specimens of shrubs and trees, both in flower\nand fruit; but owing to the drought, the herbaceous plants were, for\nthe most part, dried up. Among the latter, however, they saw a large\nand fine terrestrial species of Epidendrum, whose stem grew to the\nheight of several feet, and when surmounted by its flowers reached\ntwelve or fifteen feet high. Many of the salt-marsh plants seen in\nthe Fijis, were also observed here. Besides the plants, some shells\nand a beautiful cream-colored pigeon were obtained.",
        "During the day we were busily engaged in the survey of the harbor,\nand in making astronomical and magnetical observations on the beach,\nwhile some of the officers were employed purchasing curiosities,\non shore, at the town, and alongside the ship. These consisted of\nkrises, spears, shields, and shells; and the Sulus were not slow in\ncomprehending the kind of articles we were in search of.",
        "Few if any of the Sulus can write or read, though many talk\nSpanish. Their accounts are all kept by the slaves. Those who can read\nand write are, in consequence, highly prized. All the accounts of the\nDatu of Soung are kept in Dutch, by a young Malay from Tarnate, who\nwrites a good hand, and speaks English, and whom we found exceedingly\nuseful to us. He is the slave of the Datu, who employs him for this\npurpose only. He told us he was captured in a brig by the pirates of\nBasilan, and sold here as a slave, where he is likely to remain for\nlife, although he says the Datu has promised to give him his freedom\nafter ten years.",
        "Horses, cows, and buffaloes are the beasts of burden, and a Sulu\nmay usually be seen riding either one or the other, armed cap-a-pie,\nwith kris, spear, and target, or shield.",
        "They use saddles cut out of solid wood, and many ride with their\nstirrups so short that they bring the knees very high, and the\nriders look more like well-grown monkeys than mounted men. The cows\nand buffaloes are guided by a piece of thong, through the cartilage\nof the nose. By law, no swine are allowed to be kept on the island,\nand if they are bought, they are immediately killed. The Chinese are\nobliged to raise and kill their pigs very secretly, when they desire\nthat species of food; for, notwithstanding the law and the prejudices\nof the inhabitants, the former continue to keep swine.",
        "[Natives.] The inhabitants of Sulu are a tall, thin, and\neffeminate-looking race: I do not recollect to have seen one corpulent\nperson among them. Their faces are peculiar for length, particularly\nin the lower jaw and chin, with high cheek-bones, sunken, lack-lustre\neyes, and narrow foreheads. Their heads are thinly covered with hair,\nwhich appears to be kept closely cropped. I was told that they pluck\nout their beards, and dye their teeth black with antimony, and some\nfile them.",
        "Their eyebrows appear to be shaven, forming a very regular and high\narch, which they esteem a great beauty.",
        "The dress of the common people is very like that of the Chinese,\nwith loose and full sleeves, without buttons. The materials of which\nit is made are grass-cloths, silks, satins, or white cotton, from\nChina. I should judge from the appearance of their persons, that they\nought to be termed, so far as ablutions go, a cleanly people. There\nis no outward respect or obeisance shown by the slave to his master,\nnor is the presence of the Datu, or even of the Sultan himself, held\nin any awe. All appear upon an equality, and there does not seem to\nbe any controlling power; yet it may be at once perceived that they\nare suspicious and jealous of strangers.",
        "The Sulus, although they are ready to do any thing for the sake of\nplunder, even to the taking of life, yet are not disposed to hoard\ntheir ill-gotten wealth, and, with all their faults, cannot be termed\navaricious.",
        "They have but few qualities to redeem their treachery, cruelty,\nand revengeful dispositions; and one of the principal causes of\ntheir being so predominant, or even of their existence, is their\ninordinate lust for power. When they possess this, it is accompanied\nby a haughty, consequential, and ostentatious bravery. No greater\naffront can be offered to a Sulu, than to underrate his dignity and\nofficial consequence. Such an insult is seldom forgiven, and never\nforgotten. From one who has made numerous voyages to these islands, I\nhave obtained many of the above facts, and my own observation assures\nme that this view of their character is a correct one. I would,\nhowever, add another trait, which is common among them, and that is\ncowardice, which is obvious, in spite of their boasted prowess and\ndaring. This trait of character is universally ascribed to them among\nthe Spaniards in the Philippines, who ought to be well acquainted\nwith them.",
        "The dress of the women is not unlike that of the men in\nappearance. They wear close jackets of various colors when they go\nabroad, and the same loose breeches as the men, but over them they\nusually have a large wrapper (sarong), not unlike the pareu of the\nPolynesian islanders, which is put round them like a petticoat, or\nthrown over the shoulders. Their hair is drawn to the back of the head,\nand around the forehead it is shaven in the form of a regular arch,\nto correspond with the eyebrows. Those that I saw at the Sultan’s\nwere like the Malays, and had light complexions, with very black\nteeth. The Datu thought them very handsome, and on our return he\nasked me if I had seen the Sultan’s beauties. The females of Sulu\nhave the reputation of ruling their lords, and possess much weight\nin the government by the influence they exert over their husbands.",
        "[Superiority of women.] It may be owing to this that there is little\njealousy of their wives, who are said to hold their virtues in no\nvery great estimation. In their houses they are but scantily clothed,\nthough women of rank have always a large number of rings on their\nfingers, some of which are of great value, as well as earrings of\nfine gold. They wear no stockings, but have on Chinese slippers, or\nSpanish shoes. They are as capable of governing as their husbands,\nand in many cases more so, as they associate with the slaves, from\nwhom they obtain some knowledge of Christendom, and of the habits\nand customs of other nations, which they study to imitate in every way.",
        "The mode in which the Sulus employ their time may be exemplified by\ngiving that of the Datu; for all, whether free or slave, endeavor to\nimitate the higher rank as far as is in their power. The datus seldom\nrise before eleven o’clock, unless they have some particular business;\nand the Datu Mulu complained of being sleepy in consequence of the\nearly hour at which we had disturbed him.",
        "On rising, they have chocolate served in gilt glassware, with some\nlight biscuit, and sweetmeats imported from China or Manila, of\nwhich they informed me they laid in large supplies. They then lounge\nabout their houses, transacting a little business, and playing at\nvarious games, or, in the trading season, go to the meeting of the\nRuma Bechara.",
        "At sunset they take their principal meal, consisting of stews of fish,\npoultry, beef, eggs, and rice, prepared somewhat after the Chinese\nand Spanish modes, mixed up with that of the Malay. Although Moslems,\nthey do not forego the use of wine, and some are said to indulge in\nit to a great extent. After sunset, when the air has become somewhat\ncooled by the refreshing breezes, they sally forth attended by their\nretainers to take a walk, or proceed to the bazaars to purchase goods,\nor to sell or to barter away their articles of produce. They then pay\nvisits to their friends, when they are in the habit of having frequent\nconvivial parties, talking over their bargains, smoking cigars,\ndrinking wine and liquors, tea, coffee, and chocolate, and indulging\nin their favorite pipe of opium. At times they are entertained with\nmusic, both vocal and instrumental, by their dependants. Of this art\nthey appear to be very fond, and there are many musical instruments\namong them. A datu, indeed, would be looked upon as uneducated if he\ncould not play on some instrument.",
        "It is considered polite that when refreshments are handed they should\nbe partaken of. Those offered us by the Datu were such as are usual,\nbut every thing was stale. Of fruit they are said to be very fond,\nand can afford to indulge themselves in any kinds. With all these\narticles to cloy the appetite, only one set meal a day is taken;\nthough the poorer classes, fishermen and laborers, partake of two.",
        "[Government.] The government of the Sulu Archipelago is a kind of\noligarchy, and the supreme authority is vested in the Sultan and the\nRuma Bechara or trading council. This consists of about twenty chiefs,\neither datus, or their next in rank, called orangs, who are governors\nof towns or detached provinces. The influence of the individual\nchiefs depends chiefly upon the number of their retainers or slaves,\nand the force they can bring into their service when they require\nit. These are purchased from the pirates, who bring them to Sulu and\nits dependencies for sale. The slaves are employed in a variety of\nways, as in trading prahus, in the pearl and bêche de met fisheries,\nand in the search after the edible birds’ nests.",
        "A few are engaged in agriculture, and those who are at all educated\nare employed as clerks. These slaves are not denied the right of\nholding property, which they enjoy during their lives, but at their\ndeath it reverts to the master. Some of them are quite rich, and\nwhat may appear strange, the slaves of Sulu are invariably better\noff than the untitled freemen, who are at all times the prey of the\nhereditary datus, even of those who hold no official stations. By\nall accounts these constitute a large proportion of the population,\nand it being treason for any low-born freeman to injure or maltreat\na datu, the latter, who are of a haughty, overbearing, and tyrannical\ndisposition, seldom keep themselves within bounds in their treatment\nof their inferiors. The consequence is, the lower class of freemen\nare obliged to put themselves under the protection of some particular\ndatu, which guards them from the encroachment of others. The chief\nto whom they thus attach themselves, is induced to treat them well,\nin order to retain their services, and attach them to his person,\nthat he may, in case of need, be enabled to defend himself from\ndepredations, and the violence of his neighbors.",
        "Such is the absence of legal restraint, that all find it necessary\nto go abroad armed, and accompanied by a trusty set of followers,\nwho are also armed. This is the case both by day and night, and,\naccording to the Datu’s account, frequent affrays take place in the\nopen streets, which not unfrequently end in bloodshed.",
        "Caution is never laid aside, the only law that exists being that of\nforce; but the weak contrive to balance the power of the strong by\nuniting. They have not only contentions and strife among themselves,\nbut it was stated at Manila that the mountaineers of Sulu, who are\nsaid to be Christians, occasionally make inroads upon them. At Sulu,\nhowever, it did not appear that they were under much apprehension of\nthese attacks. The only fear I heard expressed was by the Sultan,\nin my interview with him; and the cause of this, as I have already\nstated, was probably a desire to find an excuse for not affording us\nfacilities to go into the interior. Within twenty years, however,\nthe reigning sultan has been obliged to retire within his forts,\nin the town of Sulu, which I have before adverted to.",
        "These people are hostile to the Sulus of the coast and towns, who\ntake every opportunity to rob them of their cattle and property,\nfor which the mountaineers seek retaliation when they have an\nopportunity. From the manner in which the Datu spoke of them,\nthey are not much regarded. Through another source I learned that\nthe mountaineers were Papuans, and the original inhabitants of the\nislands, who pay tribute to the Sultan, and have acknowledged his\nauthority, ever since they were converted to Islamism. Before that\ntime they were considered extremely ferocious, and whenever it was\npracticable they were destroyed. Others speak of an original race\nof Dyacks in the interior, but there is one circumstance to satisfy\nme that there is no confidence to be placed in this account, namely,\nthat the island is not of sufficient extent to accommodate so numerous\na population as some ascribe to it.",
        "The forts consist of a double row of piles, filled in with coral\nblocks. That situated on the east side of the small stream may be\nsaid to mount a few guns, but these are altogether inefficient; and\nin another, on the west side, which is rather a rude embankment than\na fort, there are some twelve or fifteen pieces of large calibre;\nbut I doubt very much if they had been fired off for years, and many\nof the houses built upon the water would require to be pulled down\nbefore these guns could be brought to bear upon any thing on the side\nof the bay, supposing them to be in a good condition; a little farther\nto the east of the town, I was informed they had a kind of stockade,\nbut none of us were permitted to see it.",
        "[Population.] According to our estimates, and the information we\nreceived while at Sulu, the island itself does not contain more than\nthirty thousand inhabitants, of which the town of Soung may have six\nor seven thousand. The whole group may number about one hundred and\nthirty thousand. I am aware, however, that it is difficult to estimate\nthe population of a half-civilized people, who invariably exaggerate\ntheir own strength; and visitors are likewise prone to do the same\nthing. The Chinese comprise about an eighth of the population of the\ntown, and are generally of the lower class. They are constantly busy\nat their trades, and intent upon making money.",
        "At Soung, business seems active, and all, slaves as well as masters,\nseem to engage in it. The absence of a strong government leaves all at\nliberty to act for themselves, and the Ruma Bechara gives unlimited\nfreedom to trade. These circumstances promote the industry of the\ncommunity, and even that of the slave, for he too, as before observed,\nhas a life interest in what he earns.",
        "Soung being the residence of the Sultan, as well as the grand depot\nfor all piratical goods, is probably more of a mart than any of the\nsurrounding towns. In the months of March and April it is visited by\nseveral Chinese junks, who remain trading until the beginning of the\nmonth of August. If delayed after that time, they can scarcely return\nin safety, being unable to contend with the boisterous weather and\nhead winds that then prevail in the Chinese seas. These junks are said\nto come chiefly from Amoy, where the cottons, etc., best suited for\nthe Sulus are made. Their cargoes consist of a variety of articles of\nChinese manufacture and produce, such as silk, satin goods, cottons,\nred and checked, grass-cloth clothing, handkerchiefs, cutlery, guns,\nammunition, opium, lumber, china and glass-ware, rice, sugar, oil,\nlard, and butter. In return for this merchandise they obtain camphor,\nbirds’ nests, rattans, bêche de mer, pearls, and pearl-shells, coco,\ntortoise-shell, and wax; but there is no great quantity of these\narticles to be obtained, perhaps not more than two or three cargoes\nduring the season. The trade requires great knowledge of the articles\npurchased, for the Chinese and Sulus are both such adepts in fraud,\nthat great caution and circumspection are necessary.",
        "[Customs dues.] The duties on importation are not fixed, but are\nchanged and altered from time to time by the Ruma Bechara. The\nfollowing was stated to me as the necessary payments before trade\ncould be carried on:",
        "A large ship, with Chinese on board, pays       $2,000\nA large ship, without Chinese on board, pays     1,800\nSmall ships                                      1,500\nLarge brig                                       1,000\nSmall brig                                         500\nSchooners                                       from 150 to 400",
        "This supposes them all to have full cargoes. That a difference should\nbe made in a vessel with or without Chinamen, seems singular; but this,\nI was told, arose from the circumstance that English vessels take them\non board, in order to detect and prevent the impositions of the Sulus.",
        "Vessels intending to trade at Soung should arrive before the Chinese\njunks, and remain as long as they stay, or even a few days later. In\ntrading with the natives, all operations ought to be carried on for\ncash, or if by barter, no delivery should be made until the articles\nto be taken in exchange are received. In short, it is necessary to\ndeal with them as though they were undoubted rogues, and this pleases\nthem much more than to appear unsuspicious. Vessels that trade engage\na bazaar, which they hire of the Ruma Bechara, and it is advisable to\nsecure the good-will of the leading datus in that council by presents,\nand paying them more for their goods than others.",
        "There are various other precautions necessary in dealing with\nthis people; for they will, if possible, so act as to give rise to\ndisputes, in which case an appeal is made to their fellows, who are\nsure to decide against the strangers. Those who have been engaged\nin this trade, advise that the prices of the goods should be fixed\nupon before the Sultan, and the scales of the Datu of Soung employed;\nfor although these are quite faulty, the error is compensated by the\narticles received being, weighed in the same. This also secures the\nDatu’s good-will, by the fee (some fifty dollars) which he receives\nfor the use of them. Thus it will be perceived that those who desire\nto trade with Sulu, must make up their minds to encounter many\nimpositions, and to be continually watchful of their own interests.",
        "Every possible precaution ought to be taken; and it will be found,\nthe treatment will depend upon, or be according to the force or\nresolution that is displayed. In justice to this people it must be\nstated, there have been times when traders received every kindness and\nattention at the island of Sulu, and I heard it even said, that many\nvessels had gone there to refit; but during the last thirty or forty\nyears, the reigning sultans and their subjects have become hostile\nto Europeans, of whom they plunder and destroy as many as they can,\nand this they have hitherto been allowed to do with impunity.",
        "Although I have described the trade with Sulu as limited, yet\nit is capable of greater extension; and had it not been for the\npiratical habits of the people, the evil report of which has been\nso widely spread, Sulu would now have been one of the principal\nmarts of the East. The most fertile parts of Borneo are subject to\nits authority. There all the richest productions of these Eastern\nseas grow in immense quantities, but are now left ungarnered in\nconsequence of there being no buyers. The cost of their cultivation\nwould be exceedingly low, and I am disposed to believe that these\narticles could be produced here at a lower cost than anywhere else.",
        "Besides the trade with China, there is a very considerable one with\nManila in small articles, and I found one of our countrymen engaged\nin this traffic, under the Spanish flag. To him I am indebted for\nmuch information that his opportunities of observation had given him.",
        "The materials for the history of Sulu are meagre, and great doubt\nseems to exist in some periods of it. That which I have been able to\ngather is as follows:",
        "[History.] The island of Sulu is generally believed to have been\noriginally inhabited by Papuans, some of whom, as I have already\nstated, are still supposed to inhabit the mountainous part. The first\nintercourse had with them was by the Chinese, who went there in search\nof pearls. The Orang Dampuwans were the first of the Malays to form\nsettlements on the islands; but after building towns, and making other\nimprovements, they abandoned the islands, in consequence, it is said,\nof the inhabitants being a perfidious race, having previously to\ntheir departure destroyed as many of the natives as they could.",
        "The fame of the submarine riches of this archipelago reached Banjar\nor Borneo, the people of which were induced to resort there, and\nfinding it to equal their expectation, they sent a large colony,\nand made endeavors to win over the inhabitants, and obtain thereby\nthe possession of their rich isle. In order to confirm the alliance,\na female of Banjarmassing, of great beauty, was sent, and married to\nthe principal chief; and from this alliance the sovereigns of Sulu\nclaim their descent. The treaty of marriage made Sulu tributary to\nthe Banjarmassing empire.",
        "After the Banjars had thus obtained possession of the archipelago,\nthe trade in its products attracted settlers from the surrounding\nislands, who soon contrived to displace the aborigines, and drive\nthem to the inaccessible mountains for protection.",
        "When the Chinese took possession of the northern parts of Borneo,\nunder the Emperor Songtiping, about the year 1375, the daughter of that\nprince was married to a celebrated Arabian chief named Sheriff Alli,\nwho visited the shores of Borneo in quest of commerce. The descendants\nof this marriage extended their conquests not only over the Sulu\nArchipelago, but over the whole of the Philippines, and rendered\nthe former tributary to Borneo. In three reigns after this event,\nthe sultan of Borneo proper married the daughter of a Sulu chief, and\nfrom this union came Mirhome Bongsu, who succeeding to the throne while\nyet a minor, his uncle acted as regent. Sulu now wished to throw off\nthe yoke of Borneo, and through the intrigues of the regent succeeded\nin doing so, as well as in retaining possession of the eastern side\nof Borneo, from Maludu Bay on the north, to Tulusyan on the south,\nwhich has ever since been a part of the Sulu territory.",
        "This event took place before Islamism became the prevailing religion;\nbut which form of idolatry, the Sulus pretend, is not now known. It\nis, however, believed the people on the coasts were Buddhists, while\nthose of the interior were Pagans.",
        "The first sultan of Sulu was Kamaludin, and during his reign one Sayed\nAlli, a merchant, arrived at Sulu from Mecca. He was a sherif, and soon\nconverted one-half of the islanders to his own faith. He was elected\nsultan on the death of Kamaludin, and reigned seven years, in the\ncourse of which he became celebrated throughout the archipelago. Dying\nat Sulu, a tomb was erected to him there, and the island came to be\nlooked upon by the faithful as the Mecca of the East, and continued\nto be resorted to as a pilgrimage until the arrival of the Spaniards.",
        "[Tawi Tawi.] Sayed Alli left a son called Batua, who succeeded him. The\nlatter had two sons, named Sabudin and Nasarudin, who, on the death\nof their father, made war upon each other. Nasarudin, the youngest,\nbeing defeated, sought refuge on Tawi Tawi, where he established\nhimself, and built a fort for his protection. The difficulties\nwere finally compromised, and they agreed to reign together over\nSulu. Nasarudin had two sons, called Amir and Bantilan, of whom the\nformer was named as successor to the two brothers, and on their deaths\nascended the throne. During his reign another sherif arrived from\nMecca, who succeeded in converting the remainder of the population to\nIslamism. Bantilan and his brother Amir finally quarrelled, and the\nlatter was driven from Sulu to seek refuge in the island of Basilan,\nwhere he became sultan.",
        "On the arrival of the Spaniards in 1566, a kind of desultory war was\nwaged by them upon the various islands, in the hope of conquering\nthem and extending their religion. In these wars they succeeded in\ngaining temporary possession of a part of Sulu, and destroyed the\ntomb of Sayed Alli. The Spaniards always looked upon the conversion\nof the Moslems to the true Catholic faith with great interest; but in\nthe year 1646, the sultan of Magindanao succeeded in making peace,\nby the terms of which the Spaniards withdrew from Sulu, and were to\nreceive from the sultan three cargoes of rice annually as a tribute.",
        "In 1608, the small-pox made fearful ravages, and most of the\ninhabitants fled from the scourge. Among these was the heir apparent,\nduring whose absence the throne became vacant, and another was elected\nin his stead. This produced contention for a short time, which ended\nin the elected maintaining his place.",
        "This tribute continued to be paid until the flight of Amir to Basilan,\nabout the year 1752, where he entered into a secret correspondence\nwith the authorities at Zamboanga, and after two years a vessel was\nsent from Manila, which carried him to that capital, where he was\ntreated as a prisoner of state.",
        "[The English treaty.] In June, 1759, an English ship, on board of\nwhich was Dalrymple, then in the service of the East India Company,\narrived at Sulu on a trading voyage. Dalrymple remained at Sulu\nfor three months, engaged in making sales and purchases. The Sultan\nBantilan treated him with great kindness, and sought the interest of\nDalrymple to obtain the liberation of his brother, who was now held\nprisoner by the Spaniards at Manila, by telling him of the distress\nof his brother’s wife, who had been left behind when Amir quitted the\nisland, and had been delivered of twins, after he had been kidnapped\nby the Spaniards. Dalrymple entered into a pledge to restore Amir,\nand at the same time effected a commercial treaty between the East\nIndia Company and the Sulu chiefs. By this it was stipulated that\nan annual cargo should be sent to Sulu, and sold at one hundred per\ncent. profit, for which a return cargo should be provided for the China\nmarket, which should realize an equal profit there, after deducting all\nexpenses. The overplus, if any, was to be carried to the credit of the\nSulus. This appears to have been the first attempt made by the English\nto secure a regular commercial intercourse with this archipelago.",
        "In the year 1760, a large fleet of Spanish vessels sailed from Manila,\nwith about two thousand men, having the Sultan Amir on board, to\ncarry on a war against Sulu.",
        "On their arrival, they began active operations. They were repelled\non all sides, and after seven days’ ineffectual attempts, they gave\nup their design. They returned to Manila, it is said, with a loss of\nhalf their number, and without having done any injury to the Sulus. Not\ndiscouraged with this failure, the Spaniards, about two years after,\norganized a still larger force, which is estimated by some accounts as\nhigh as ten thousand men. Although this failed in its attempts on the\nfort at Soung, the Spaniards obtained possession of Tanjong Matonda,\none of the small ports on the island, where they erected a church and\nfort. Here they established a colony, and appointed a governor. The\ninhabitants upon this deserted their habitations in the neighborhood,\nand fled to the mountains, which, it is said, excited the mountaineers,\na host of whom, with their chief, whose name was Sri Kala, determined\nto rush upon the Spaniards, and annihilate them. Having to contend\nagainst disciplined troops, it was not an easy task to succeed. But\nSri Kala had a follower, named Sigalo, who offered to lead the host\nto battle against the Spaniards, and to exterminate them, or die in\nthe attempt. The chief accepted his offer, and Sigalo, with a chosen\nfew, marched towards the fort, leaving the rest of the mountaineers\nin readiness to join them at an appointed signal, and rush into the\nfort en masse.",
        "[Victory over Spaniards.] Sri Kala and Sigalo, in order to lull\nthe watchfulness of the Spaniards, took with them a young woman, of\nexquisite beauty, named Purmassuri. The lustful Spaniards were thus\nthrown off their guard, the signal was given, and the host, rushing\nforward, entered the fort, every Spaniard within which was slain. A\nfew only, who were on the outside, escaped to the vessels, which set\nsail, and after encountering various mishaps, returned to Manila.",
        "Some time after this the Sultan Bantilan died, and his son Alim-ud-deen\nwas proclaimed sultan. Dalrymple did not return until 1762, with a\npart of the appointed cargo; but the vessel in which the larger part\nhad been shipped, failed to arrive, from not being able to find Sulu,\nand went to China. Thence she proceeded to Manila, and afterwards\nto Sulu. The captain of the latter vessel gave a new credit to the\nSulus, before they had paid for their first cargo; and on the arrival\nof Dalrymple the next time, he found that the small-pox had carried\noff a large number of the inhabitants, from which circumstance all\nhis hopes of profit were frustrated. He then obtained for the use of\nthe East India Company, a grant of the island of Balambangan, which\nlies off the north end of Borneo, forming one side of the Straits of\nBalabac, the western entrance to the Sulu Sea. Here he proposed to\nestablish a trading post, and after having visited Madras, he took\npossession of this island in 1763.",
        "In October, 1762, the English took Manila, where the Sultan Amir\nwas found by Dalrymple, who engaged to reinstate him on his throne,\nif he would cede to the English the north end of Borneo, as well\nas the south end of Palawan. This he readily promised, and he was,\nin consequence, carried back to Sulu and reinstated; his nephew,\nAlim-ud-deen, readily giving place to him, and confirming the grant\nto the East India Company, in which the Ruma Bechara joined.",
        "After various arrangements, the East India Company took possession of\nBalambangan, in the year 1773, and formed a settlement there with a\nview of making it an emporium of trade for Eastern commodities. Troops\nand stores were sent from India, and the population began to increase\nby settlers, both Chinese and Malays, who arrived in numbers. In the\nyear 1775, the fort, notwithstanding all the treaties and engagements\nbetween Dalrymple and the Sultan, was surprised by the Sulus, and many\nof the garrison put to death. [Victory over English.] This virtually\nput an end to the plans of the English, although another attempt was\nmade to re-establish the settlement by Colonel Farquhar, in 1803;\nbut it was thought to be too expensive a post, and was accordingly\nabandoned in the next year. This act of the Sulus fairly established\ntheir character for perfidy, and ever since that transaction they\nhave been looked upon as treacherous in the highest degree, and,\nwhat is singular, have been allowed to carry on their piracies quite\nunmolested. The taking of Balambangan has been generally imputed to the\ntreacherous disposition and innate love of plunder among the Sulus,\nas well as to their fear that it would destroy the trade of Sulu by\ninjuring all that of the archipelago. But there are strong reasons\nfor believing that this dark deed owed its origin in part to the\ninfluence of the Spaniards and Dutch, who looked with much distrust\nupon the growth of the rival establishment. Such was the jealousy\nof the Spaniards, that the governor of the Philippines peremptorily\nrequired that Balambangan should be evacuated. The Sulus boast of the\ndeed, and admit that they received assistance from both Zamboanga and\nTernate, the two nearest Spanish and Dutch ports. These nations had\ngreat reasons to fear the establishment of a power like that of the\nEast India Company, in a spot so favorably situated to secure the\ntrade of the surrounding islands, possessing fine harbors, and in\nevery way adapted to become a great commercial depot. Had it been\nheld by the East India Company but for a few years, it must have\nbecome what Singapore is now.",
        "The original planner of this settlement is said to have been Lord\nPigot; but the merit of carrying it forward was undoubtedly due to\nDalrymple, whose enterprising mind saw the advantage of the situation,\nand whose energy was capable of carrying the project successfully\nforward.",
        "Since the capture of Balambangan, there has been no event in the\nhistory of Sulu that has made any of the reigns of the Sultans\nmemorable, although fifteen have since ascended the throne.",
        "Sulu has from all the accounts very much changed in its character\nas well as population since the arrival of the Spaniards, and the\nestablishment of their authority in the Philippines. Before that\nevent, some accounts state that the trade with the Chinese was\nof great extent, and that from four to five hundred junks arrived\nannually from Cambojia, with which Sulu principally traded. At that\ntime the population is said to have equalled in density that of the\nthickly-settled parts of China.",
        "The government has also undergone a change; for the Sultan, who\namong other Malay races is usually despotic, is here a mere cipher,\nand the government has become an oligarchy. This change has probably\nbeen brought about by the increase of the privileged class of Datus,\nall of whom were entitled to a seat in the Ruma Bechara until about\nthe year 1810, when the great inconvenience of so large a council\nwas felt, and it became impossible to control it without great\ndifficulty and trouble on the part of the Sultan. The Ruma Bechara\nwas then reduced until it contained but six of the principal Datus,\nwho assumed the power of controlling the state. The Ruma Bechara,\nhowever, in consequence of the complaints of many powerful Datus,\nwas enlarged; but the more powerful, and those who have the largest\nnumerical force of slaves, still rule over its deliberations. The whole\npower, within the last thirty years, has been usurped by one or two\nDatus, who now have monopolized the little foreign trade that comes\nto these islands. The Sultan has the right to appoint his successor,\nand generally names him while living. In default of this, the choice\ndevolves upon the Ruma Bechara, who elect by a majority.",
        "[Piracies] From a more frequent intercourse with Europeans and the\ndiscovery of new routes through these seas, the opportunities of\ncommitting depredations have become less frequent, and the fear of\ndetection greater. By this latter motive they are more swayed than\nby any thing else, and if the Sulus have ever been bold and daring\nrobbers on the high seas, they have very much changed.",
        "Many statements have been made and published relative to the piracies\ncommitted in these seas, which in some cases exceed, and in others\nfall short, of the reality. Most of the piratical establishments are\nunder the rule, or sail under the auspices of the Sultan and Ruma\nBechara of Sulu, who are more or less intimately connected with\nthem. The share of the booty that belongs to the Sultan and Ruma\nBechara is twenty-five per cent. on all captures, whilst the Datus\nreceive a high price for the advance they make of guns and powder,\nand for the services of their slaves.",
        "The following are the piratical establishments of Sulu, obtained\nfrom the most authentic sources, published as well as verbal. The\nfirst among these is the port of Soung, at which we anchored, in\nthe island of Sulu; not so much from the number of men available\nhere for this pursuit, as the facility of disposing of the goods. By\nthe Spaniards they are denominated Illanun or Lanuns pirates. [273]\nThere are other rendezvous on Pulo Toolyan, at Bohol, Tonho, Pilas,\nTawi Tawi, Sumlout, Pantutaran, Parodasan, Palawan, and Basilan,\nand Tantoli on Celebes. These are the most noted, but there are many\nminor places, where half a dozen prahus are fitted out. Those of Sulu,\nand those who go under the name of the Lanuns, have prahus of larger\nsize, and better fitted. They are from twenty to thirty tons burden,\nand are propelled by both sails and oars. They draw but little water,\nare fast sailers, and well adapted for navigating through these\ndangerous seas. These pirates are supposed to possess in the whole\nabout two hundred prahus, which usually are manned with from forty to\nfifty pirates; the number therefore engaged in this business, may be\nestimated at ten thousand. They are armed with muskets, blunderbusses,\nkrises, hatchets, and spears, and at times the vessels have one or two\nlarge guns mounted. They infest the Macassar Strait, the Celebes Sea,\nand the Sulu Sea. Soung is the only place where they can dispose of\ntheir plunder to advantage, and obtain the necessary outfits. It may\nbe called the principal resort of these pirates, where well-directed\nmeasures would result in effectually suppressing the crime.",
        "Besides the pirates of Sulu, the commerce of the eastern islands is\nvexed with other piratical establishments. In the neighboring seas,\nthere are the Malay pirates, who have of late years become exceedingly\ntroublesome. Their prahus are of much smaller size than those of Sulu,\nbeing from ten to twelve tons burden, but in proportion they are much\nbetter manned, and thus are enabled to ply with more efficiency their\noars or paddles. These prahus frequent the shores of Malacca Straits,\nCape Roumania, the Carimon Isles, and the neighboring straits, and\nat times they visit the Rhio Straits. Some of the most noted, I was\ninformed, were fitted out from Johore, in the very neighborhood of\nthe English authorities at Singapore; they generally have their haunts\non the small islands on the coast, from which they make short cruises.",
        "They are noted for their arrangements for preventing themselves\nfrom receiving injury, in the desperate defences that are sometimes\nmade against them. These small prahus have usually swivels mounted,\nwhich, although not of great calibre, are capable of throwing a shot\nbeyond the range of small-arms. It is said that they seldom attempt\nan attack unless the sea is calm, which enables them to approach their\nvictims with more assurance of success, on account of the facility with\nwhich they are enabled to manage their boats. The frequent calms which\noccur in these seas between the land and sea breezes, afford them many\nopportunities of putting their villanous plans in operation; and the\nmany inlets and islets, with which they are well acquainted, afford\nplaces of refuge and ambush, and for concealing their booty. They\nare generally found in small flotillas of from six to twenty prahus,\nand when they have succeeded in disabling a vessel at long shot, the\nsound of the gong is the signal for boarding, which, if successful,\nresults in a massacre more or less bloody, according to the obstinacy\nof the resistance they have met with.",
        "In the winter months, the Malacca Straits are most infested with them;\nand during the summer, the neighborhood of Singapore, Point Rumania,\nand the channels in the vicinity. In the spring, from February to\nMay, they are engaged in procuring their supplies, in fishing, and\nrefitting their prahus for the coming year.",
        "[Suppression of pirates.] I have frequently heard plans proposed\nfor the suppression of these pirates, particularly of those in the\nneighborhood of the settlements under British rule. The European\nauthorities are much to blame for the quiescent manner in which they\nhave so long borne these depredations, and many complaints are made\nthat Englishmen, on being transplanted to India, lose that feeling of\nhorror for deeds of blood, such as are constantly occurring at their\nvery doors, which they would experience in England. There are, however,\nmany difficulties to overcome before operations against the pirates\ncan be effective. The greatest of these is the desire of the English\nto secure the good-will of the chiefs of the tribes by whom they are\nsurrounded. They thus wink at their piracies on the vessels of other\nnations, or take no steps to alleviate the evils of slavery. Indeed\nthe language that one hears from many intelligent men who have\nlong resided in that part of the world is, that in no country where\ncivilization exists does slavery exhibit so debasing a form as in her\nIndian possessions. Another difficulty consists in the want of minute\nknowledge of the coasts, inlets, and hiding-places of the pirates, and\nthis must continue to exist until proper surveys are made. This done,\nit would be necessary to employ vessels that could pursue the pirates\neverywhere, for which purpose steamers naturally suggest themselves.",
        "What will appear most extraordinary is, that the very princes who\nare enjoying the stipend for the purchase of the site whereon the\nEnglish authority is established, are believed to be the most active\nin equipping the prahus for these piratical expeditions; yet no notice\nis taken of them, although it would be so easy to control them by\nwithholding payment until they had cleared themselves from suspicion,\nor by establishing residents in their chief towns.",
        "[The Bajows.] Another, and a very different race of natives who\nfrequent the Sulu Archipelago, must not be passed by without\nnotice. These are the Bajow divers or fishermen, to whom Sulu is\nindebted for procuring the submarine treasures with which her seas\nare stored. They are also very frequently employed in the bêche de\nmer or trepang fisheries among the islands to the south. The Bajows\ngenerally look upon Macassar as their principal place of resort. They\nwere at one time believed to be derived from Johore, on the Malayan\npeninsula; at another, to be Buguese; but they speak the Sulu dialect,\nand are certainly derived from some of the neighboring islands. The\nname of Bajows, in their tongue, means fishermen. From all accounts,\nthey are allowed to pursue their avocations in peace, and are not\nunfrequently employed by the piratical datus, and made to labor for\nthem. They resort to their fishing-grounds in fleets of between one\nand two hundred sail, having their wives and children with them,\nand in consequence of the tyranny of the Sulus, endeavor to place\nthemselves under the protection of the flag of Holland, by which\nnation this useful class of people is encouraged. The Sulu Seas are\ncomparatively little frequented by them, as they are unable to dispose\nof the produce of their fisheries for want of a market, and fear the\nexactions of the Datus. Their prahus are about five tons each. The\nBajows at some islands are stationary, but are for the most part\nconstantly changing their ground. The Spanish authorities in the\nPhilippines encourage them, it is said, to frequent their islands,\nas without them they would derive little benefit from the banks in\nthe neighboring seas, where quantities of pearl-oysters are known\nto exist, which produce pearls of the finest kind. The Bajows are\ninoffensive and very industrious, and in faith Mahomedans.",
        "The climate of Sulu during our short stay, though warm, was\nagreeable. The time of our visit was in the dry season, which lasts\nfrom October till April, and alternates with the wet one, from May\ntill September. June and July are the windy months, when strong\nbreezes blow from the westward. In the latter part of August and\nSeptember, strong gales are felt from the south, while in December\nand January the winds are found to come from the northward; but light\nwinds usually prevail from the southwest during the wet season, and\nfrom the opposite quarter, the dry, following closely the order of the\nmonsoons in the China seas. As to the temperature, the climate is very\nequable, the thermometer seldom rising above 90° or falling below 70°.",
        "Diseases are few, and those that prevail arise from the manner in\nwhich the natives live. They are from that cause an unhealthy-looking\nrace. The small-pox has at various times raged with great violence\nthroughout the group, and they speak of it with great dread. Few of\nthe natives appeared to be marked with it, which may have been owing,\nperhaps, to their escaping this disorder for some years. Vaccination\nhas not yet been introduced among them, nor have they practiced\ninoculation.",
        "Notwithstanding Soung was once the Mecca of the East, its people\nhave but little zeal for the Mahomedan faith. It was thought at once\ntime that they had almost forgotten its tenets, in consequence of\nthe neglect of all their religious abservances. The precepts which\nthey seem to regard most are that of abstaining from swine’s flesh,\nand that of being circumcised. Although polygamy is not interdicted,\nfew even of the datus have more than one wife.",
        "Soung Road offers good anchorage; and supplies of all kinds may be\nhad in abundance. Beef is cheap, and vegetables and fruits at all\nseasons plenty.",
        "Our observations placed the town in latitude 6° 01’ N., longitude 120°\n55’ 51’’ E.",
        "Having concluded the treaty and other business that had taken me to\nSulu, we took our departure for the Straits of Balabac, the western\nentrance into this sea, with a fine breeze to the eastward. By\nnoon we had reached the group of Pangootaaraang, consisting of five\nsmall islands. All of these are low, covered with trees, and without\nlagoons. They presented a great contrast to Sulu, which was seen behind\nus in the distance. The absence of the swell of the ocean in sailing\nthrough this sea is striking, and gives the idea of navigating an\nextensive bay, on whose luxuriant islands no surf breaks. There are,\nhowever, sources of danger that incite the navigator to watchfulness\nand constant anxiety; the hidden shoals and reefs, and the sweep of\nthe tide, which leave him no control over his vessel.",
        "[Cagayan Sulu.] Through the night, which was exceedingly dark, we\nsounded every twenty minutes, but found no bottom; and at daylight\non the 7th, we made the islands of Cagayan Sulu, in latitude 7° 03’\n30’’ N., longitude 118° 37’ E. The tide or current was passing the\nislands to the west-southwest, three quarters of a mile per hour;\nwe had soundings of seventy-five fathoms. Cagayan Sulu has a pleasant\nappearance from the sea, and may be termed a high island. It is less\ncovered with undergrowth and mangrove-bushes than the neighboring\nislands, and the reefs are comparatively small. It has fallen off in\nimportance; and by comparing former accounts with those I received,\nand from its present aspect, it would seem that it has decreased\nboth in population and products. Its caves formerly supplied a large\nquantity of edible birds’ nests; large numbers of cattle were to be\nfound upon it; and its cultivation was carried on to some extent. These\narticles of commerce are not so much attended to at the present time,\nand the bêche de mer and tortoise-shell, formerly brought hither,\nare now carried to other places. There is a small anchorage on the\nwest side, but we did not visit it. There are no dangers near these\nsmall islands that may not be guarded against. Our survey extended\nonly to their size and situation, as I deemed it my duty to devote\nall the remainder of the time I had to spare to the Balabac Straits.",
        "[Balabac straits.] After the night set in, we continued sounding\nevery ten minutes, and occasionally got bottom in from thirty to\nseventy fathoms. At midnight, the water shoaled to twenty fathoms,\nwhen I dropped the anchor until daylight. We shortly afterwards had\na change of wind, and a heavy squall passed over us.",
        "In the morning we had no shoal ground near us, and the bank on which\nwe had anchored was found to be of small size; it is probable that\nwe had dropped the anchor on the shoalest place. Vessels have nothing\nto fear in this respect.",
        "At 9:00 a.m. of the 8th, we made the Mangsee Islands ahead of us, and\nlikewise Balabac to the north, and Balambagan to the south. Several\nsand-banks and extensive reefs were also seen between them. On seeing\nthe ground on which we had to operate, of which the published charts\ngive no idea whatever, I determined to proceed, and take a central\nposition with the ship under the Mangsee Islands; but in order not to\nlose time, I hoisted out and dropped two boats, under Lieutenant Perry,\nto survey the first sand-bank we came to, which lies a few miles to\nthe eastward of these islands, with orders to effect this duty and join\nme at the anchorage, or find a shelter under the lee of the islands.",
        "At half-past two p.m. we anchored near the reef, in thirty-six fathoms\nwater. I thought myself fortunate in getting bottom, as the reefs on\nclosing with them seemed to indicate but little appearance of it.",
        "The rest of the day was spent in preparing the boats for our\noperations. I now felt the want of the tender. Although in the absence\nof this vessel, great exposure was necessary to effect this survey,\nI found both officers and men cheerful and willing. The parties were\norganized,–the first to proceed to the north, towards Balabac Island,\nto survey the intermediate shoals and reefs, under Lieutenant Emmons\nand Mr. Totten; the second to the south, under Lieutenants Perry and\nBudd; and Mr. Hammersly for the survey of the shoals of Balambangan and\nBanguey, and their reefs. The examination of the Mangsee Islands, and\nthe reefs adjacent, with the astronomical and magnetic observations,\netc., devolved on myself and those who remained on board the ship.",
        "The weather was watched with anxiety, and turned out disagreeable,\nheavy showers and strong winds prevailing; notwithstanding, the\nboats were despatched, after being as well protected against it as\npossible. We flattered ourselves that these extensive reefs would\nproduce a fine harvest of shells; but, although every exertion\nwas made in the search, we did not add as many to our collections\nas we anticipated. Some land-shells, however, were found that we\nlittle expected to meet with, for many of the trees were covered\nwith them, and on cutting them down, large quantities were easily\nobtained. Mr. Peale shot several birds, among which was a Nicobar\npigeon; some interesting plants and corals were also added. On the\nisland a large quantity of drift-wood was found, which with that\nwhich is growing affords ample supplies of fuel for ships. No fresh\nwater is to be had, except by digging, the island being but a few\nfeet above high-water mark.",
        "Although the time was somewhat unfavorable, Lieutenant Emmons and\nparty executed their orders within the time designated, and met with no\nother obstructions than the inclemency of the weather. This was not,\nhowever, the case with Lieutenant Perry, who, near a small beach on\nthe island of Balambangan, encountered some Sulus, who were disposed\nto attack him. The natives, no doubt, were under the impression that\nthe boats were from some shipwrecked vessel. They were all well armed,\nand apparently prepared to take advantage of the party if possible;\nbut, by the prudence and forbearance of this officer, collision was\navoided, and his party saved from an attack.",
        "[Balambangan.] The island of Balambangan was through the\ninstrumentality of Mr. Dalrymple, as heretofore stated, obtained\nfrom the Sulus for a settlement and place of deposit, by the East\nIndia Company, who took possession of it in 1773. Its situation off\nthe northern end of Borneo, near the fertile district of that island,\nits central position, and its two fine ports, offered great advantages\nfor commerce, and for its becoming a great entrepot for the riches\nof this archipelago. Troops, and stores of all kinds, were sent\nfrom India; numbers of Chinese and Malays were induced to settle;\nand Mr. Herbert, one of the council of Bencoolen, was appointed\ngovernor. It had been supposed to be a healthy place, as the island\nwas elevated, and therefore probably free from malaria; but in 1775\nthe native troops from India became much reduced from sickness, and\nthe post consequently much weakened. This, with the absence of the\ncruisers from the harbor, afforded a favorable opportunity for its\ncapture; and the wealth that it was supposed to contain created an\ninducement that proved too great for the hordes of marauding pirates\nto resist. Choosing their time, they rushed upon the sentries, put\nthem to death, took possession of the guns, and turned them against\nthe garrison, only a few of whom made their escape on board of a small\nvessel. The booty in goods and valuables was said to have been very\nlarge, amounting to nearly four hundred thousand pounds sterling.",
        "Although Borneo offers many inducements to commercial enterprise,\nthe policy of the Dutch Company has shut themselves out, as well\nas others, by interdicting communication. In consequence, except\nthrough indirect channels, there has been no information obtained of\nthe singular and unknown inhabitants of its interior. This, however,\nis not long destined to be the case.",
        "Mr. Brooke, an English gentleman of fortune, has, since our passage\nthrough these seas, from philanthropic motives, made an agreement\nwith the rajah of Sarawack, on the northern and western side of\nBorneo, to cede to him the administration of that portion of the\nisland. This arrangement it is believed the British government will\nconfirm, in which event Sarawack will at once obtain an importance\namong the foreign colonies, in the Eastern seas, second only to that\nof Singapore.",
        "The principal inducement that has influenced Mr. Brooke in this\nundertaking is the interest he feels in the benighted people of the\ninterior, who are known under the name of Dyack, and of whom some\nextraordinary accounts have been given.",
        "A few of these, which I have procured from reputable sources, I will\nnow relate, in order that it may be seen among what kind of people\nthis gentleman has undertaken to introduce the arts of civilization.",
        "[The Dyacks.] The Dyacks are, by all accounts, a fine race, and\nmuch the most numerous of any inhabiting Borneo. They are almost\nexclusively confined to the interior, where they enjoy a fine climate,\nand all the spontaneous productions of the tropics. They are believed\nto be the aborigines of the island. The name of Dyack seems to be\nmore particularly applied to those who live in the southern section\nof Borneo. To the north they are called Idaan or Tirun, and those so\ntermed are best known to the Sulus, or the inhabitants of that part of\nthe coast of Borneo over which the Sulus rule. In personal appearance,\nthe Dyacks are slender, have higher foreheads than the Malays, and are\na finer and much better-looking people. Their hair is long, straight,\nand coarse, though it is generally cropped short round the head. The\nfemales are spoken of as being fair and handsome, and many of those\nwho have been made slaves are to be seen among the Malays.",
        "In manners the Dyacks are described as simple and mild, yet they are\ncharacterized by some of the most uncommon and revolting customs of\nbarbarians. Their government is very simple; the elders in each village\nfor the most part rule; but they are said to have chiefs that do not\ndiffer from the Malay rajahs. They wear no clothing except the maro,\nand many of them are tattooed, with a variety of figures, over their\nbody. They live in houses built of wood, that are generally of large\nsize, and frequently contain as many as one hundred persons. These\nhouses are usually built on piles, divided into compartments, and\nhave a kind of veranda in front, which serves as a communication\nbetween the several families. The patriarch, or elder, resides in\nthe middle. The houses are entered by ladders, and have doors, but\nno windows. The villages are protected by a sort of breastwork.",
        "Although this people are to be found throughout all Borneo, and even\nwithin a few miles of the coast, yet they do not occupy any part of\nits shores, which are held by Malays, or Chinese settlers. There\nis no country more likely to interest the world than Borneo. All\naccounts speak of vast ruins of temples and palaces, throughout the\nwhole extent of its interior, which the ancestors of the present\ninhabitants could not have constructed. The great resemblance these\nbear to those of China and Cambojia has led to the belief that Borneo\nwas formerly peopled by those nations; but all traditions of the origin\nof these edifices have been lost; and so little is now known of the\nnorthern side of Borneo, that it would be presumption to indulge in any\nsurmises of what may have been its state during these dark ages. Even\nthe Bugis priests, who are the best-informed persons in the country,\nhave no writings or traditions that bear upon the subject; and the\nfew scattered legends of Eastern origin, can afford no proof of the\noccurrence of the events they commemorate in any particular locality.",
        "The accounts of the habits of the Dyacks are discrepant. Some give them\ncredit for being very industrious, while others again speak of them\nas indolent. They are certainly cultivators of the soil, and in order\nto obtain the articles they need, will work assiduously. Many of them\nare employed in collecting gold-dust, and some in the diamond mines;\nand they will at times be found procuring gums, rattans, etc., from\ntheir native forests for barter. They are a people of great energy\nof character, and perseverance in the attainment of their object,\nparticularly when on war-parties, or engaged in hunting.",
        "Their food consists of rice, hogs, rats, snakes, monkeys, and many\nkinds of vermin, with which this country abounds.",
        "Their chief weapon is the parang or heavy knife, somewhat like the\nkris. It is manufactured of native iron and steel, with which the\ncoast of the country is said to abound. They have a method of working\nit which renders it unnecessary for them to look to a foreign supply;\nthe only articles of foreign hardware that they are said to desire,\nare razors, out of which to make their cockspurs. One thing seems\nstrange: although asserted upon good authority, that the iron and\nsteel of the coast are thought to be superior by foreigners, they\nare not to be compared with that which is found in the interior,\nand manufactured by the Dyacks. All the best krises used by the Malay\nrajahs and chiefs, are obtained from the interior. Some of these are\nexquisitely manufactured, and so hard that, without turning the edge,\nthey cut ordinary wrought iron and steel.",
        "Among their other weapons is the sumpit, a hollow tube, through\nwhich they blow poisoned arrows. The latter are of various kinds,\nand those used in war are dipped in the sap of what the natives term\nthe “upo.” The effect of this poison is almost instantaneous, and\ndestroys life in four or five minutes. Those who have seen a wound\ngiven accidentally, describe the changes that the poison occasions\nas plainly perceptible in its progress. Before using the arrow, its\npoisoned point is dipped in lime-juice to quicken it. The range of\nthe sumpit is from fifty to sixty yards. Although the arrows are\npoisoned, yet it is said they sometimes eat the games they kill\nwith them, parboiling it before it is roasted, which is thought to\nextract the poison. Firearms, respecting which they have much fear,\nhave not yet been introduced among them; indeed, it is said that so\neasily are they intimidated by such weapons, that on hearing a report\nof a gun they invariably run away. Each individual in a host would\nbe impressed with the belief that he was the one that was to be shot.",
        "[The diwatas.] They address their prayers to the maker of the world,\nwhom they call Dewatta, and this is all the religion they have. There\nare many animals and birds held by them in high veneration, and they\nare close observers of the flight of birds, from which they draw\nprognostics. There is in particular a white-headed eagle or kite, upon\nwhose flight and cries they put great reliance, and consult them in war\nor on any particular expedition. For this purpose they draw numbers\nof them together, and feed them by scattering rice about. It is said\ntheir priests consult their entrails also on particular occasions,\nto endeavor to look into future events.",
        "In the performance of their engagements and oaths, they are most\nscrupulous. They seem to have some idea of a future life, and that\non the road to their elysium they have to pass over a long tree,\nwhich requires the assistance of all those they have slain in this\nworld. The abode of happy spirits is supposed to be on the top of Kini\nBalu, one of their loftiest mountains, and the portals are guarded\nby a fiery serpent, who does not suffer any virgin to pass into the\ncelestial paradise.",
        "Polygamy does not exist among them, but they have as concubines slaves,\nwho are captured in their wars or rather predatory expeditions. If a\nwife proves unfaithful to her husband, he kills several of his slaves,\nor inflicts upon her many blows, and a divorce may be effected by\nthe husband paying her a certain price, and giving up her clothes and\nornaments, after which he is at liberty to marry another. The women,\nhowever, exercise an extraordinary influence over the men.",
        "[Headhunting.] But of all their peculiar traits, there is none more\nstrange than the passion they seem to indulge for collecting human\nheads. These are necessary accompaniments in many transactions of\ntheir lives, particularly in their marriages, and no one can marry\nunless he has a certain number of heads; indeed, those who cannot\nobtain these are looked upon with disdain by the females. A young man\nwishing to wed, and making application to marry her for whom he has\nformed an attachment, repairs with the girl’s father to the rajah\nor chief, who immediately inquires respecting the number of heads\nhe has procured, and generally decides that he ought to obtain one\nor two more, according to his age, and the number the girl’s father\nmay have procured, before he can be accepted. He at once takes his\ncanoe and some trusty followers, and departs on his bloody errand,\nwaylaying the unsuspecting or surprising the defenceless, whose head\nhe immediately cuts off, and then makes a hurried retreat. With this\nhe repairs to the dwelling of his mistress, or sends intelligence\nof his success before him. On his arrival, he is met by a joyous\ngroup of females, who receive him with every demonstration of joy,\nand gladly accept his ghastly offering.",
        "Various barbarous ceremonies now take place, among which the heads\nundergo inspection to ascertain if they are fresh; and, in order to\nprove this, none of the brain must be removed, nor must they have been\nsubmitted to smoke to destroy the smell. After these preliminaries,\nthe family honor of the bride is supposed to be satisfied, and she is\nnot allowed to refuse to marry. A feast is now made, and the couple\nare seated in the midst naked, holding the bloody heads, when handfuls\nof rice are thrown over them, with prayers that they may be happy and\nfruitful. After this, the bridegroom repairs in state to the house of\nthe bride, where he is received at the door by one of her friends,\nwho sprinkles him with the blood of a cock, and her with that of a\nhen. This completes the affair, and they are man and wife.",
        "[Cremation.] Funerals are likewise consecrated by similar offerings,\nthe corpse remaining in the house until a slave can be procured,\nby purchase or otherwise, whom they design to behead at the time the\nbody is burnt. This is done in order that the defunct may be attended\nby a slave on his way to the other world or realms of bliss. After\nbeing burnt, the ashes of the deceased are gathered in an urn, and\nthe head of the slave preserved and placed near it.",
        "In some parts, a rajah or chief is buried with great pomp in his war\nhabiliments, and food and his arms are placed at his side. A mound\nis erected over him, which is encircled with a bamboo fence, upon\nwhich a number of fresh heads are stuck, all the warriors who have\nbeen attached to him bringing them as the most acceptable offering;\nand subsequently these horrid offerings are renewed.",
        "The Dyacks are found also in the Celebes island, but there, as in\nBorneo, they are confined to the interior. I have already mentioned\nthat they were supposed to have been the original inhabitants of the\nSulu Archipelago. The Sulus speak of the country of the Dyacks as\nbeing exceedingly fertile and capable of producing every thing. The\nnorth end of Borneo is particularly valuable, as its produce is easily\ntransported from the interior, where much of the land is cultivated. I\nhave obtained much more information in relation to this people, in\na variety of ways, from individuals as well as from the published\naccounts, which are to be found at times in the Eastern prints; but\nas this digression has already extended to a great length, I trust\nthat enough has been said to enable the reader to contrast it with\nthe natives who inhabit the islands that dot the vast Pacific Ocean,\nand to make him look forward with interest to the developments that\nthe philanthropic exertions of Mr. Brooke may bring to light.",
        "Having completed our duties here, the boats were hoisted in, after\ndespatching one to leave orders for Mr. Knox of the Flying-Fish,\nin a bottle tied to a flagstaff.",
        "On the afternoon of the 12th, we got under way to proceed direct to\nSingapore, and passed through the channel between the reef off the\nMangsee Islands, and those of Balambangan and Banguey. We found this\nchannel clear, and all the dangers well defined.",
        "As the principal objects of my visit were to ascertain the disposition\nand resources of the Sulus for trade, and to examine the straits\nleading into the Sulu seas, in order to facilitate the communication\nwith China, by avoiding on the one hand the eastern route, and on\nthe other the dangers of the Palawan Passage, it may be as well to\ngive the result of the latter inquiry, referring those who may be\nmore particularly interested to the Hydrographical Atlas and Memoir.",
        "The difficulties in the Palawan Passage arising from heavy seas\nand fresh gales do not exist in the Sulu Sea, nor are the shoals so\nnumerous or so dangerous. In the place of storms and rough water,\nsmooth seas are found, and for most of the time moderate breezes,\nwhich do not subject a vessel to the wear and tear experienced in\nbeating up against a monsoon.",
        "The Balabac Straits may be easily reached, either from Singapore,\nor by beating up along the western shore of Borneo. When the straits\nare reached, a vessel by choosing her time may easily pass through\nthem by daylight, even by beating when the wind is ahead. Once\nthrough, the way is clear, with the exception of a few coral lumps;\nthe occasional occurrence of the north wind will enable a vessel to\npass directly to the shores of the island of Panay. A fair wind will\nordinarily prevail along the island, and, as I have already mentioned,\nit may be approached closely. The passage through to the eastward of\nMindoro Island may be taken in preference to that on the west side\nthrough the Mindoro Strait, and thus all the reefs and shoals will\nbe avoided. Thence, the western coast of Luzon will be followed to\nthe north, as in the old route.",
        "I do not think it necessary to point out any particular route through\nthe Sulu Sea, as vessels must be guided chiefly as the winds blow,\nbut I would generally avoid approaching the Sulu Islands, as the\ncurrents are more rapid, and set rather to the southward. Wherever\nthere is anchorage, it would be advisable to anchor at night, as much\ntime might thus be saved, and a knowledge of the currents or sets\nof the tides obtained. Perhaps it would be as well to caution those\nwho are venturesome, that it is necessary to keep a good look-out,\nand those who are timid, that there does not appear to be much danger\nfrom the piratical prahus, unless a vessel gets on shore; in that\ncase it will not be long before they will be seen collecting in the\nhorizon in large numbers.",
        "[Advantages of Sulu treaty.] The treaty that I made with the Sultan, if\nstrictly enforced on the first infraction, will soon put an end to all\nthe dangers to be apprehended from them. To conclude, I am satisfied\nthat under ordinary circumstances, to pass through the Sulu Sea will\nshorten by several days the passage to Manila or Canton, and be a\ngreat saving of expense in the wear and tear of a ship and her canvass.",
        "On the 13th, we passed near the location of the Viper Shoal, but saw\nnothing of it. It is, therefore, marked doubtful on the chart. As\nI had but little time to spare, the look-outs were doubled, and we\npursued our course throughout the night, sounding as we went every\nfifteen minutes; but nothing met our view.",
        "On the 14th, although we had the northeast monsoon blowing fresh, we\nexperienced a current of twenty-two miles setting to the north. This\nwas an unexpected result, as the currents are usually supposed\nto prevail in the direction of the monsoon. On the 15th. we still\nexperienced it, though not over fifteen miles. On the 16th, we found\nit setting west, and as we approached the Malayan Peninsula it was\nfound to be running southwest.",
        "On the 18th, we made Pulo Aor and Pulo Pedang, and arriving off the\nSingapore Straits, I hove-to, to await daylight. In the morning at\ndawn, we found ourselves in close company with a Chinese junk. The\n19th, until late in the afternoon, we were in the Singapore Straits,\nmaking but slow progress towards this emporium of the East. The number\nof native as well as foreign vessels which we passed, proved that we\nwere approaching some great mart, and at 5:00 p.m. we dropped our\nanchor in Singapore Roads. Here we found the Porpoise, Oregon, and\nFlying-Fish, all well: the two former had arrived on January 22nd,\nnearly a month before, and the latter three days previously. Before\nconcluding this chapter, I shall revert to their proceedings since\nour separation off the Sandwich Islands.",
        "The instructions to the brigs have been heretofore given; but it may\nnot be amiss to repeat here that the object in detaching them was,\nthat they might explore the line of reefs and islands known to exist to\nthe northward and westward of the Hawaiian Group, and thence continue\ntheir course towards the coast of Japan. Had they effected the latter\nobject, it would have given important results in relation to the force\nof the currents, and the temperature of the water. It was desirable,\nif possible, to ascertain with certainty the existence on the coast of\nJapan of a current similar to the Gulf Stream, to which my attention\nhad been particularly drawn.",
        "The first land they made was on December 1, 1841, and was Necker\nIsland. Birds, especially the white tern, had been seen in numbers\nprior to its announcement. Necker Island is apparently a mass of\nvolcanic rocks, about three hundred feet high, and is destitute of\nany kind of vegetation, but covered with guano. It is surrounded by\na reef, three miles from which soundings were obtained, in twenty\nfathoms water. The furious surf that was beating on all sides of the\nisland, precluded all possibility of a landing being made. By the\nconnected observations of the vessels it lies in longitude 164° 37’\nW., and latitude 23° 44’ N.",
        "The French-Frigate Shoal was seen on the 3rd; the weather proved bad,\nand they were unable to execute the work of examining this reef. The\nsea was breaking furiously upon it.",
        "On the 7th, the Maro Reef was made in latitude 25° 24’ 29’’ N.,\nlongitude 170° 43’ 24’’ W. Bottom was found at a distance of four\nmiles from the reef, with forty-five fathoms of line. On the 8th,\nthey passed over the site of Neva Isle, as laid down by Arrowsmith,\nbut no indications of land were seen.",
        "[Arrival at Singapore.] On the 11th, Lieutenant-Commandant Ringgold\ndetermined, on account of the condition of the brigs, and the\ncontinuance of bad weather, it was impossible to keep their course to\nthe northward and westward towards the coast of Japan; he, therefore,\nhauled to the southward, which was much to be regretted, and followed\nso very nearly in the same track as that pursued by the Vincennes,\ntowards the China seas, that nothing new was elicited by them.",
        "After a passage of fifty-six days from the Sandwich Islands, they\ndropped their anchors in Singapore on January 19, 1842, all well. Here\nthey found the United States ship Constellation, Commodore Kearney, and\nthe sloop of war Boston, Captain Long, forming the East India squadron.",
        "Manila in 1819 [274]",
        "By An American Naval Officer.",
        "[Coral.] “ * * * The fine bay of Manila, thirty leagues in\ncircumference, is situated near the middle of the west side of the\nisland, and has good and clear anchorage in all parts of it, excepting\non a coral ledge, called the Shoal of St. Nicholas, which is the only\nvisible danger in the bay. The dangerous part of it is, however, of\nsmall extent, and with proper attention easily avoided; the least\nof water found on it at present is eleven feet, but its summit is\nconstantly approaching the surface of the sea, as has been ascertained\nby surveys made at different periods by orders of government, which\ncircumstance seems to indicate the presence of Zoophytes, that compound\nof animal and vegetable life, whose incessant and rapid labors, and,\nas we are told by naturalists, whose polypus-like powers of receiving\nperfect form and vitality into numberless dismembered portions of their\nbodies, have long excited much curiosity and admiration. These small,\ncompound animals, commence their operations at the bottom of the sea,\nand proceed upwards, towards the surface, spreading themselves in\nvarious ramifications; the older members of the mass become concrete,\npetrify, and form dangerous shoals; the superior portion of these\nlittle colonists always being the last produced, in its turn generates\nmyriads of others, and so on, ad infinitum, till they reach the surface\nof the ocean. These coral reefs and shoals are found in most parts of\nthe world, within the tropics; but the waters of the eastern hemisphere\nseem to be peculiarly congenial to their production, and, indeed, there\nappear to be certain spaces or regions in these seas, which are their\nfavorite haunts. Among many others may be mentioned the Mozambique\nchannel, and that tract of ocean, from the eastern coast of Africa,\nquite across to the coast of Malabar, including the Mahé, Chagas,\nMaldive and Laccadive archipelagos; the southeastern part of the China\nsea; the Red sea; the eastern part of Java; the coasts of all the Sunda\nislands; and various places in the Pacific ocean. These shoals, when\nthey begin to emerge from the sea, are frequented by aquatic fowls,\nwhose feathers, and other deposits, combined with the fortuitous\nlanding of drifts of wood, weeds, and various other substances from\nthe adjacent lands, in the course of time form superaqueous banks,\nof considerable elevation; and the broken fragments of coral thrown\nup by the waves, slowly, but constantly increase their horizontal\ndiameter. Coconuts are frequently seen floating upon the sea in these\nregions, some of which are no doubt thrown upon the shores of the\nnew created lands; from which accidental circumstance this fruit is\nthere propagated. Vagrant birds unconsciously deposit the germs of\nvarious other productions of the vegetable kingdom, which in due\nseason spring up and clothe their surfaces with verdure; and the\nnatural accumulation of dead and putrid vegetation serves to assist\nin the formation of a rich and productive soil, and to increase the\naltitudes of these new creations. As I have been always much amused\nand interested by this subject, and had frequent opportunities,\nduring many years’ experience, to observe and examine these shoals in\ntheir various stages of subaqueous progress, and subsequent emersion\nI am convinced that not only many considerable islands, but extensive\ninsular groups, owe their existence to the above origin.”",
        "[The people.]  [275]\"* * * The natives of these islands are generally\nwell made, and bear strong marks of activity and muscular vigor;\nthey are in general somewhat larger than the Javanese, and bear some\naffinity in the features of their faces to the Malays; their noses\nare however more prominent, and their cheek bones not so high, nor are\ntheir skins so dark. Their hair is of a jet black, made glossy by the\nconstant application of coconut oil, as is the custom in all India,\nand drawn together and knotted on top, in the manner of the Malays. The\nwomen display great taste in the arrangement and decorations of their\nhair, which they secure with silver or gold bodkins, the heads of\nwhich are frequently composed of precious stones.”",
        "[Mixed blood.]  [276]\"* * * A very considerable proportion of the\npopulation of Manila is composed of the mestizos; they are the\noffspring of the intermarriages of the Spaniards with the native\nwomen, and these again forming connexions with the whites, or with\nthe native Indians (the latter, however, less frequent), combine\nin stamping upon their descendants a great variety of features and\nshades of color; a general resemblance is, however, to be traced, and\nwaiving color and manners, a mestizo could not easily be mistaken for\na native. This class of the inhabitants is held in nearly the same\nestimation as the whites. They are very cleanly in their persons,\nand neat in their dress, which, among the males, consists generally\nof a pair of cotton trousers of various colors, as fancy dictates,\nand shoes in the European manner, a frock, or tunic, of striped grass\nmanufacture, worn outside the trousers, in the manner of the Asiatic\nArmenians (but without the sash, or girdle), the collars of which are\ntastefully embroidered, and thrown back on their shoulders; a European\nhat completes their costume, which is light, cool and airy, and after\na stranger has been a short time accustomed to see what he at first\nwould call a perversion of dress, his prejudices subside, and he has\nno hesitation in pronouncing it very proper and graceful. They are\nremarkably fine limbed, and well built, the females especially, who\nare really models of the most complete symmetry; their hair and eyes,\nwhich unlike their skins, seldom vary from the original jet black of\ntheir native parents, bestow upon them the primary characteristics of\nthe brunette. This people, unlike the generality of mixed colors in\nthe human race, have been improved by their intermixture, they are more\nindustrious and cleanly than the Spaniards, possess more intelligence\nand polish than the Indians and are less malicious and revengeful than\neither. The men are employed mostly as writers, brokers, agents and\noverseers; many of them hold lucrative offices under government, and\nthey not unfrequently arrive at wealth and consideration. The women\nare also industrious, and capable of great intellectual improvement;\nthey have a natural grace and ease in their manner, and make excellent\nwives and mothers. This character must not, however, be taken in an\nunlimited sense, for we cannot expect this rule to be without its\nexceptions, and it is true that some of these females do degenerate,\nand copy after the manners of the creoles, or white natives; but\nthis is only the case when, by their intercourse with the whites,\ntheir Indian blood is merged and lost in the European. That part\nof the population in which is blended the blood of the Chinese and\nTagalogs is named the Chinese mestizos.",
        "The natives are not unapt in acquiring knowledge, neither do they\nwant industry, when efforts are made, and inducements displayed\nto call their powers into action. They are excellent mechanics and\nartisans, and, as horticulturists, their superiority over many of the\nAsiatics is acknowledged. They are polite and affable to strangers,\nbut irascible, and when excited are very sanguinary; their natural\nbias to this revengeful and cruel character, is strengthened and\nrendered more intense by the ... doctrines of the Roman catholic\nreligion as dictated to them by the designing and interested priests\nwho reside among them. The culprit always finds a sanctuary in the\nnearest church, till by the payment of some pecuniary mulct, he\nsatisfies the demands of the priests, obtains absolution, appeases\nthe resentment of the relations of the deceased, and eludes the arm\nof justice; he grows hardened by impunity, repeats his offences,\nand again escapes as before.”",
        "[A Filipino foundry.] “* * * All the necessary works for a garrisoned\ncity are within its walls; extensive magazines were erected in 1686,\nbesides which are a hall of arms, or armory, a repository for powder,\nwith bomb-proof vaults, and commodious quarters and barracks for the\ngarrison. There is also a furnace and foundry here, which, although\ntheir operations were suppressed in 1805, is the most ancient in\nthe Spanish monarchy; this establishment was founded in 1584, in\nthe village of St. Anna, near Manila; to the latter of which places\nit was transferred in 1590. The first founder was a Pampango Indian,\nnamed Pandapira. When the Spaniards first arrived at Manila, in 1571,\nthey found there a large foundry, which was accidentally burnt,\nin consequence of the combustibility of the building and effects,\nwhich character applies to all the houses of that period.”",
        "[Language.]  [277]\"* * * Their colloquial language, like that of the\nnatives of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and many other islands in these seas,\nis a dialect of the peninsular Malay from whence it is thought they\noriginated; and so striking is its similarity among all these islands,\nthat the natives of each can, in a greater or less degree, understand\nthat of all the others. The characters of their written language\ndiffer widely, and great varieties of arrangement exist among them. The\nTagalogs write from top to bottom on palm leaves and strips of bamboo;\nand many of the Moros or Mahomedans use the Arabic characters.”",
        "[Difference of days.]  [278]From the circumstance of the Spaniards\narriving in these seas by Cape Horn, and the general route being by\nthe Cape of Good Hope, a consequent difference in time of one day\nis produced in the different reckoning; the Spaniards losing, and\nthose who steer eastward gaining, each in the proportion of half a\nday in completing the semi-circumference of the globe. Consequently,\nthe time at Manila, being regulated by their own reckonings, is one\nday later than that of those who arrive there by steering eastward\nfrom America or Europe; as for instance, when by the accounts of the\nlatter it is Sunday, by theirs it is only Saturday.",
        "[English in Manila.] In the year 1762, the city of Manila was taken\nby the English, where, and at Cavite, immense quantities of naval and\nmilitary stores, brass and iron ordnance, and several fine ships, fell\ninto their hands. It was, however, soon delivered up to the Spaniards,\non a promise of the payment to the English of four millions of\ndollars as a ransom, which, however, never has been paid. This breach\nof faith and promise has been loudly complained of by the latter,\nand as pertinaciously excused by the Spaniards, who complain that\nthe British plundered the city, and committed many other excesses,\ncontrary to the express conditions of their engagements, by which\nthey were virtually rendered nugatory.",
        "[Galleon trade.] The inhabitants of Manila have long enjoyed the\nprivilege of sending two annual ships to Acapulco called Galleons,\nNavios, or Register-Ships, with the produce of the Philippines, of\nChina, and other parts of Asia; in return for which, they receive\nvarious articles of the production of South America; the principal\nof which are cochineal, merchandise of different descriptions of\nEuropean origin, and silver in Spanish dollars and ingots, which\ncompose the principal part of the value of their return cargoes,\namounting annually to about three million five hundred thousand\nSpanish dollars. A large proportion of this property belongs to the\nconvents in Manila, whose great revenues not only enable them to\nengage in extensive mercantile operations, but to lend considerable\nsums to the merchants on bottomry. For the indulgence in this trade,\nthe proprietors pay a large sum of money to the crown.",
        "These ships were of the burden of from twelve to fifteen hundred\ntons, and were numerously manned and well appointed for defense; but\nof late years, since the revolt of the Spanish colonies, which has\nrendered the navigation of the intermediate seas dangerous to these\nenterprises, the trade has been greatly interrupted, and instead\nof risking it in large bodies, private ships of smaller burden have\nbeen hired for the purpose of dividing the risk; some of these have\nbeen put under foreign colors, though formerly the galleons wore,\nby instruction, the royal flag, their officers were commissioned\nand uniformed like the officers of the navy, and the ships were\nunder the same regulations and discipline. The object, however, of\nthe trade in smaller ships has not been obtained; for so great are\nthe fears of the owners and agents of their being captured, and so\nmany restrictions laid upon the commanders that they lie in port the\nprincipal part of the time; so that in September, 1819, the ships of\nthe preceding year had not arrived at Manila; neither had any been\ndispatched from the latter place for Acapulco during that time. These\ninterruptions, and in fact, the virtual suspension of this commerce,\nwill undoubtedly, if a liberal and enlightened policy is pursued,\nresult greatly to the advantage of these islands and the mother\ncountry. Already since the establishment of the cortes, permitting\nforeigners to settle permanently at Manila, great improvements have\nbeen made in the productions of the island, and important additions\nto the revenue. The failure of the annual remittance of dollars from\nSouth America to defray the expenses of the colonial government, of\nwhich their revenues from the islands were not adequate to meet one\nhalf, has been severely felt, and has stimulated them to make some\nvery unusual exertions. Foreign commerce has been more countenanced in\nconsequence of this state of things, and greater encouragement has been\ngiven to the growers and manufacturers of their staple exports; and if\nthe affairs of these islands should in future be properly conducted,\nthe revenue arising from the impost on the single article of coffee,\nwill in a few years be amply sufficient to support the government,\nand leave a net income of the revenue arising from the imposts on all\nother articles, besides what would accrue from the taxes and numerous\nother resources. A free commerce with other nations would create a\ncompetition, and a consequent reduction in the price of imports, and\ntheir articles of export would increase, in proportion to the demand\nfor them. In short, nothing is wanting in these beautiful islands,\nbut ability to direct, and energy to execute the most extensive\nplans of agriculture and commerce, which the bounties of the soil,\nand its excellent climate and situation, would most certainly render\ncompletely successful; and, instead of being, as at present it is,\na burden to Spain, it would become a source of great wealth to her.”",
        "[Spirit of independence.]  [279]\"* * * It is to be hoped that\nthe narrow and illiberal policy which has heretofore retarded the\nprosperity of these fine islands, will necessarily be superseded\nby more expanded views, and enable them to maintain the rank and\nimportance to which their intrinsic worth entitles them. The spirit\nof independence which has recently diffused its influence through\nthe Spanish colonies on the American continent, has also darted its\nrays across the Pacific, and beamed with enlivening lustre upon those\nremote regions and the sacred flames of liberty which have been kindled\nhave in the bosom of that country, though for a period concealed from\nthe view of regal parasites and dependents, burned clear and intense;\nand the time is perhaps not very remote, when it shall burst forth,\nand shed its joyous light upon the remotest and most inconsiderable\nislet of this archipelago.",
        "[Opportunity for a republic.] Perhaps no part of the world offers a\nmore eligible site for an independent republic than these islands;\ntheir insular posture and distance from any rival power, combined\nwith the intrinsic strength of a free representative government,\nwould guarantee their safety and glory; their intermediate situation,\nbetween Asia and the American continent, their proximity to China,\nJapan, Borneo, the Molucca and Sunda Islands, the Malay peninsula,\nCochin China, Tonquin, Siam, and the European possessions in the East,\nwould insure them an unbounded commerce, consequently great wealth and\npower; and their happiness would be secured by religious toleration\nand liberal views of civil liberty in the government. It must be\nconfessed, however, that the national character of the Spaniards is\nnot suitable to produce and enjoy in perfection this most desirable\nstate of affairs; it is to be feared that their bigotry would preclude\nreligious toleration, their indolence continue the present system of\nslavery, so degrading in a particular manner to a republic, their\nwant of energy paralyze the operations of enterprising foreigners\namong them. No change, however, can be for the worse, and if all\nthe advantage, cannot be reaped by them, which the citizens of our\nrepublic would secure, it will be better for them to seize and enjoy\nsuch as their genius and talents will enable them to.”",
        "[Health.]  [280]” * * * The health of the city and suburbs is\nproverbial, and the profession of a physician is, perhaps, of all\nothers the least lucrative. A worthy and intelligent Scotch doctor,\nwho had come to Manila, while I was there, to exercise his profession,\nand who lodged in the same house with me, was greatly annnoyed at\nthe want of practice which he experienced there, although he had his\nfull share of patronage, and often jocosely declared that the “dom\nclimate” would starve him; in fact he did not long remain there;\nI afterwards met him in the Isle of France, where he was still in\npursuit of practice.”",
        "[A barbarous execution.]  [281]” * * * Impelled by a very common and,\nperhaps, excusable curiosity, I rode out with some friends one day\nto witness the execution of a mestizo soldier for murder. The parade\nground of Bagumbayan was the theater of this tragic comedy, for such\nit may be trully called, and never did I experience such a revulsion\nof feeling as upon this occasion. The place was crowded with people\nof all descriptions, and a strong guard of soldiers, three deep,\nsurrounded the gallows, forming a circle, the area of which was about\ntwo hundred feet in diameter. The hangman was habited in a red jacket\nand trousers, with a cap of the same color upon his head. This fellow\nhad been formerly condemned to death for parricide, but was pardoned\non condition of turning executioner, and becoming close prisoner for\nlife, except when the duties of his profession occasionally called him\nfrom his dungeon for an hour. Whether his long confinement, and the\nignominious estimation in which he was held, combined with despair of\npardon for his heinous offense, and a natural ferocity of character,\nhad rendered him reckless of “weal or woe,” or other impulse directed\nhis movements, I know not, but never did I see such a demoniacal visage\nas was presented by this miscreant; and when the trembling culprit\nwas delivered over to his hand, he pounced eagerly upon his victim,\nwhile his countenance was suffused with a grim and ghastly smile,\nwhich reminded us of Dante’s devils. He immediately ascended the\nladder, dragging his prey after him till they had nearly reached the\ntop; he then placed the rope around the neck of the malefactor with\nmany antic gestures and grimaces highly gratifying and amusing to the\nmob. To signify to the poor fellow under his fangs that he wished to\nwhisper in his ear, to push him off the ladder, and to jump astride\nhis neck with his heels drumming with violence upon his stomach, was\nbut the work of an instant. We could then perceive a rope fast to each\nleg of the sufferer, which was pulled with violence by people under\nthe gallows, and an additional rope, to use a sea term, a preventer,\nwas round his neck, and secured to the gallows, to act in case of\naccident to the one by which the body was suspended. I had witnessed\nmany executions in different parts of the world, but never had such\na diabolical scene as this passed before my eyes.”",

        "The Peopling of the Philippines",
        "By Dr. Rudolf Virchow",
        "(Translated by O. T. Mason; in Smithsonian Institution 1899 Report.)",
        "Since the days when the first European navigators entered the South\nSea, the dispute over the source and ethnic affiliations of the\ninhabitants of that extended and scattered island world has been\nunsettled. The most superficial glance points out a contrariety in\nexternal appearances, which leaves little doubt that here peoples of\nentirely different blood live near and among one another.",
        "[\"Negritos and Indios.\"] And this is so apparent that the pathfinder\nin this region, Magellan, gave expression to the contrariety in his\nnames for tribes and islands. Since dark complexion was observed\non individuals in certain tribes and in defined areas, and light\ncomplexion on others, here abundantly, there quite exceptional,\nwriters applied Old World names to the new phenomena without further\nthought. The Philippines set the decisive example in this. Fernando\nMagellan first discovered the islands of this great archipelago in\n1521, March 16. After his death the Spaniards completed the circle\nof his discoveries. At this time the name of Negros was fixed, which\neven now is called Islas de los Pintados. For years the Spaniards\ncalled the entire archipelago Islas de Poniente; gradually, after the\nexpedition of Don Fray Garcia Jofre de Loaisa (1526), the new title\nof the Philippines prevailed, through Salazar.",
        "The people were divided into two groups, the Little Negros or Negritos\nand the Indios. It is quite conceivable that involuntarily the opinion\nprevailed that the Negritos had close relationship with the African\nblacks, and the Indios with the lighter-complexioned inhabitants of\nIndia, or at least of Indonesia.",
        "However, it must be said here that the theory of a truly African\norigin of the Negritos has been advanced but seldom, and then in a very\nhesitating manner. The idea that with the present configuration of the\neastern island world, especially with their great distances apart, a\nvariety of mankind that had never manifested any aptitude for maritime\nenterprises should have spread themselves over this vast ocean area,\nin order to settle down on this island and on that, is so unreasonable\nthat it has found scarcely a defender worth naming. More and more the\nblacks are coming to be considered the original peoples, the “Indios\"\nto be the intruders. For this there is a quite reasonable ground,\nin that on many islands the blacks dwell in the interior, difficult\nof access, especially in the dense and unwholesome mountain forests,\nwhile the lighter complexioned tribes have settled the coasts. To\nthis are added linguistic proofs, which place the lighter races, of\nhomogeneous speech, in linguistic relations with the higher races,\nespecially the Malays. Dogmatically it has been said that originally\nthese islands had been occupied entirely by the primitive black\npopulation, but afterwards, through intrusions from the sea, these\nblacks were gradually pressed away from the coast and shoved back\ninto the interior.",
        "[Complicated Pacific problem.] The problem, though it appears simple\nenough, has become complicated more and more through the progress\nof discovery, especially since Cook enlarged our knowledge of the\noriental island world. A new and still more pregnant contrast then\nthrust itself to the front in the fact that the blacks and the\nlighter-colored peoples are each separated into widely differing\ngroups. While the former hold especially the immense, almost\ncontinental, regions of Australia (New Holland) and New Guinea, and\nalso the larger archipelagos, such as New Hebrides, Solomon Islands,\nFiji (Viti) Archipelago–that is, the western areas–the north and\neast, Micronesia and Polynesia, were occupied by lighter-colored\npeoples. So the first division into Melanesia and Polynesia has\nin latest times come to be of value, and the dogma once fixed has\nremained. For the Polynesians are by many allied to the Malays,\nwhile the blacks are put together as a special ethnological race.",
        "For practical ethnology this division may suffice. But the scientific\nman will seek also for the blacks a genetic explanation. The answer\nhas been furnished by one of the greatest ethnologists, Theodor Waitz,\nwho, after he had exposed the insufficiency of the accepted formulas,\ncame to the conclusion that the differentiation of the blacks from\nthe lighter peoples might be an error. He denied that there had been\na primitive black race in Micronesia and Polynesia; in his opinion\nwe have here to do with a single race. The color of the Polynesians\nmay be out and out from natural causes different, “their entire\nphysical appearance indicates the greatest variability.” Herein the\nwhole question of the domain of variation is sprung with imperfect\nsatisfaction on the part of those travelers who give their attention\nmore to transitions than to types. Among these are not a few who have\nreturned from the South Sea with the conviction that all criteria\nfor the diagnosis of men and of races are valueless.",
        "Analytical anthropology has led to other and often unexpected\nresults. It has proved that just that portion of South Sea\npopulation which can apparently lay the strongest claim to be\nconsidered a homogeneous race must be separated into a collection\nof subvarieties. Nothing appears more likely than that the Negritos\nof the Philippines are the nearest relatives to the Melanesians, the\nAustralians, the Papuans; and yet it has been proved that all these\nare separated one from another by well-marked characters. Whether\nthese characters place the peoples under the head of varieties,\nor whether, indeed, the black tribes of the South Sea, spite of all\ndifferences, are to be traced back to one single primitive stock,\nthat is a question of prehistory for whose answer the material\nis lacking. Were it possible to furnish the proof that the black\npopulations of the South Sea were already settled in their present\nhomes when land bridges existed between their territory and Africa,\nor when the much-sought Lemuria still existed, it would not be worth\nthe trouble to hunt for the missing material. In our present knowledge\nwe can not fill the gaps, so we must yet hold the blacks of the Orient\nto be separate races.",
        "[Hair as a race index.] The hair furnished the strongest character\nfor diagnosis, in which, not alone that of the head is under\nconsideration; the hair, therefore, occupies the foreground of\ninterest. Its color is of the least importance, since all peoples of\nthe South Sea have black hair. It is more the structure and appearance\nwhich furnish the observer convenient starting points for the primary\nclassification. Generally a two-fold division satisfies. The blacks,\nit is said, have crisped hair, the Polynesians and light-colored\npeoples have smooth hair. But this declaration is erroneous in its\ngenerality. It is in no way easy to declare absolutely what hair is\nto be called crisp, and it is still more difficult to define in what\nrespects the so-called crisp varieties differ one from another. For\na long time the Australian hair was denominated crisp, until it was\nevident that it could be classed neither with that of the Africans\nnor with that of the Philippine blacks. Semper, one of the first\ntravelers to furnish a somewhat complete description of the physical\ncharacters of the Negritos, describes it as an “extremely thick,\nbrown-black, lack-luster, and crisp-woolly crown of hair.” Among\nthese peculiarities the lack-luster is unimportant, since it is due\nto want of care and uncleanliness. On the contrary, the other data\nfurnish true characters of the hair and among them the crisp-woolly\npeculiarity is most valuable.",
        "On the terms “wool” and “woolly” severe controversies, which have not\nyet closed, have taken place among ethnologists during the last ten\nyears. Also the lack of care, especially the absence of the comb,\nhas here acted as a disturbing cause in the decision. But there is\nyet a set of peoples, which were formerly included, that are now\nbeing gradually disassociated, especially the Australians and the\nVeddahs, whose hair, by means of special care, appears quite wavy\nif not entirely sleek and smooth. Generally it is frowzy and matted,\nso that its natural form is difficult to recognize. To it is wanting\nthe chief peculiarity, which obtrudes itself in the African blacks so\ncharacteristically that the compact spiral form which it assumes from\nits root, the so-called “pepper-corn,” is selected as the preferable\nmark of the race. The peculiar nappy head has it origin in the spiral\n\"rollchen.” As to the Asiatic blacks this has been for a long time\nknown among the Andamanese; it has lately been noticed upon the Sakai\nof Malacca, and it is to be found also among the Negritos of the\nPhilippines, as I can show by specimens. Therefore, if we seek ethnic\nrelationships for the Negritos of the Philippines, or as they are\nnamed, the Aetas (Etas, Itas), such connections obtrude themselves\nwith the stocks named, and the more strongly since they all have\nbrachycephalic, relatively small (nannocephalic) heads and through\ntheir small size attach themselves to the peculiar dwarf tribes.",
        "I might here comment on the singular fact that the Andaman Islands\nare situated near the Nicobars in the Indian Ocean, but that the\npopulations on both sides of them are entirely different. In my\nown detailed descriptions which treat of the skulls and the hair\nspecially, it is affirmed that the typical skull shape of the\nNicobarese is dolichocephalic and that “their hair stands between\nthe straight hair of the Mongoloid and the sleek, though slightly\ncurved or wavy, hair of the Malayan and Indian peoples;” their skin\ncolor is relatively dark, but only so much so as is peculiar to the\ntribes of India. With the little blacks of the Andamans there is not\nthe slightest agreement. In this we have one of the best evidences\nagainst the theory of Waitz-Gerland that the differences in physical\nappearance are to be attributed to variation merely. I will, however,\nso as not to be misunderstood, expressly emphasize that I am not\nwilling to declare that the two peoples have been at all times so\nconstituted; I am now speaking of actual conditions.",
        "In the same sense I wish also my remarks concerning the Negritos to\nbe taken. Not one fact is in evidence from which we may conclude that\na single neighboring people known to us has been Negritized. We are\ntherefore justified when we see in the Negritos a truly primitive\npeople. As they are now, they were more than three hundred and\nfifty years ago when the first European navigators visited these\nislands. About older relationships nothing is known. All the graves\nfrom which the bones of Negritos now in possession were taken belong\nto recent times, and also the oldest descriptions which have been\nreceived, so far as phylogeny is concerned, must be characterized\nas modern.",
        "[Negritos a primitive people.] The little change in the mode of life\nmade known through these descriptions in connection with the low grade\nof culture on which these impoverished tribes live amply testify that\nwe have before us here a primitive race.",
        "(The question whether we have to do with older, independent races\nin the Malay Archipelago or with mixtures is everywhere an open\none.–Translator.)",
        "Whoever would picture the present ethnic affiliations of the\nlight-colored peoples of the Philippines will soon land in confusion\non account of the great number of tribes. One of the ablest observers,\nFerd. Blumentritt, mentions, besides the Negritos, the Chinese and\nthe whites, not less than 51 such tribes. He classifies them in one\ngroup as Malays, according to the plan now customary. The division\nrests primarily on a linguistic foundation. But when it is noted that\nthe identity of language among all the tribes is not established and\namong many not at all proved, it is sufficiently shown that speech is\na character of little constancy, and that a language may be imposed\nupon a people to the annihilation of their own by those who belong\nto a different linguistic stock. The Malay Sea is filled with islands\non which tarry the remnants of peoples not Malay.",
        "For a long time, especially since the Dutch occupation, these old\npopulations have received the special name of Alfuros. But this\nambiguous term has been used in such an arbitrary and promiscuous\nfashion that latterly it has been well-nigh banished from ethnological\nliterature. It is not long ago that the Negritos were so called. But\nif the black peoples are eliminated, there remains on many islands at\nleast an element to be differentiated from the Malay, chiefly through\nthe darker skin color, greater orthocephaly, and more wavy, quite\ncrimped hair. I have, for the different islands, furnished proof,\nand will here only refer to the assertion that “a broad belt of\nwavy and curly hair has pressed itself in between the Papuan and the\nMalay, a belt which in the north seems to terminate with the Veddah,\nin the south with the Australian.” One can not read the accounts\nof travelers without the increasing conviction of the existence of\nseveral different, if not perhaps related, varieties of peoples thrust\non the same island.",
        "[Theory of Negrito and three Malay invasions.] From this results the\nnatural and entirely unprejudiced conclusion, which has repeatedly\nbeen stated, that either a primitive people by later intrusions\nhas been pressed back into the interior or that in course of time\nseveral immigrations have followed one another. At the same time\nit is not unreasonable to think that both processes went on at the\nsame time, and indeed this conception is strongly brought forward. So\nBlumentritt assumes that there is there a primitive black people and\nthat three separate Malay invasions have taken place. The oldest,\nwhose branches have many traits in accord with the Dayaks of Borneo,\nespecially the practice of head-hunting; a second, which also took\nplace before the arrival of the Spaniards, to which the Tagals,\nBisayas, Bicols, Ilocanos, and other tribes belong; the third,\nIslamitic, which emigrated from Borneo and might have been interrupted\nby the arrival of the Spaniards, and with which a contemporaneous\nimmigration from the Moluccas went on. It must be said, however, that\nBlumentritt admits two periods for the first invasion. In the earliest\nhe places the immigration of the Igorots, Apayos, Zambales–in short,\nall the tribes that dwelt in the interior of the country later and\nwere pressed away from the coast, therefore, actually, the mountain\ntribes. To the second half he assigns the Tinguianes, Catalanganes,\nand Irayas, who are not head-hunters, but Semper says they appear to\nhave a mixture of Chinese and Japanese blood.",
        "Against this scheme many things may be said in detail, especially that,\naccording to the apparently well-grounded assertions of Mueller-Beeck,\nthe going of the Chinese to the Philippines was developed about the\nend of the fourteenth century, and chiefly after the Spaniards had\ngotten a foothold and were using the Mexican silver in trade. At any\nrate, the apprehension of Semper, which rests on somewhat superficial\nphysiognomic ground, is not confirmed by searching investigations. So\nthe head-hunting of the mountain tribes, so far as it hints at\nrelations with Borneo, gives no sure chronological result, since\nit might have been contemporaneous in them and could have come here\nthrough invasion from other islands.",
        "The chief inquiry is this: Whether there took place other and older\ninvasions. For this we are not only to draw upon the present tribes,\nbut if possible upon the remains of earlier and perhaps now extinct\ntribes. This possibility has been brought nearer for the Philippines\nthrough certain cave deposits. We have to thank, for the first\ninformation, the traveler Jagor, whose exceptional talent as collector\nhas placed us in the possession of rich material, especially crania. To\nhis excellent report of his journey I have already dedicated a special\nchapter, in which I have presented and partially illustrated not\nonly the cave crania, but also a series of other skulls. An extended\nconference upon them has been held in the Anthropological Society.",
        "The old Spanish chroniclers describe accurately the mortuary customs\nwhich were in vogue in their time. The dead were laid in coffins\nmade from excavated tree trunks and covered with a well-fitting\nlid. They were then deposited on some elevated place, or mountain,\nor river bank, or seashore. Caves in the mountains were also utilized\nfor this purpose. Jagor describes such caves on the island of Samar,\nwest of Luzon, whose contents have recently been annihilated.",
        "The few crania from there which have been intrusted to me\nbear the marks of recent pedigree, as also do the additional\nobjects. Unfortunately, Dr. Jagor did not himself visit these\ninteresting caves, but he has brought crania thence which are of the\nhighest interest, and which I must now mention.",
        "[Study of a giant skull.] The cave in question lies near Lanang, on\nthe east coast of Samar, on the bank of a river, it is said. It is,\nas the traveler reports, celebrated in the locality “on account of its\ndepressed gigantic crania, without sutures.” The singular statement\nis made clear by means of a well-preserved example, which I lay\nbefore you. The entire cranium, including the face, is covered with\na thick layer of sinter, which gives it the appearance of belonging\nto the class of skulls with Leontiasis ossea. It is, in fact, of\ngood size, but through the incrustation it is increased to gigantic\nproportions. It is true, likewise, that it has a much flattened,\nbroad and compressed form. The cleaning of another skull has shown\nthat artificial deformation has taken place, which obviously was\ncompleted before the incrustation was laid on by the mineral water\nof the cave. I will here add that on the testimony of travelers no\nNegritos were on Samar. The island lies in the neighborhood of the\nBisayas. Although no description of the position of the skull is at\nhand and of the skeleton to which it apparently belonged, it must be\nassumed that the dead man was not laid away in a coffin, but placed\non the ground; that, in fact, he belonged to an earlier “period.” How\nlong ago that was can not be known, unfortunately, since no data are\nat hand; however, the bones are in a nearly fossilized condition,\nwhich allows the conclusion that they were deposited long ago.",
        "The deformation itself furnishes no clue to a chronological\nconclusion. In Thévenot is found the statement that, according to\nthe account of a priest, probably in the 16th century, the custom\nprevails in some of the islands to press the heads of new-born babes\nbetween two boards, also to flatten the forehead, “since they believed\nthat this form was a special mark of beauty.” A similar deformation,\nwith more pronounced flattening and backward pressure of the forehead,\nis shown on the crania which Jagor produced from a cave at Caramuan in\nLuzon. There are modes of flattening which remind one of Peru. When\nthey came into our hands it was indeed an immense surprise, since\nno knowledge of such deformation in the South Sea was at hand. First\nour information led to more thorough investigations; so we are aware\nof several examples of it from Indonesia and, indeed, from the South\nSea (Mallicolo). However, this deformation furnishes no clue to the\nantiquity of the graves.",
        "(Chinese and Korean pottery are said to have been found with\nthe deformed crania. Similar deformations exist in the Celebes,\nNew Britain, etc. Head-shaping has been universal, cf. A. B. Meyer,\nUeber Kunstliche deformirte Schaedel von Borneo und Mindanao and ueber\ndie Verbreitung der Sitte der Kunstlichen Schaedeldeformirung, 1881,\n36 pp., 4.°–Translator.)",
        "I have sawed one of these skulls in two along the sagittal suture. The\nillustration gives a good idea of the amount of compression and of the\nviolence which this skull endured when quite young. The cranial cavity\nis inclined backward and lengthened, and curves out above, while the\nocciput is pressed downward and the region of the front fontanelle\nis correspondingly lacking. Likewise, a considerable thickness of\nthe bone is to be noted, especially of the vertex. The upper jaw is\nslightly prognathous and the roof of the mouth unusually arched.",
        "For the purpose of the present study, it is unnecessary to go\nfurther into particulars. It might be mentioned that all Lanang\nskulls are characterized by their size and the firmness of bone,\nso that they depart widely from the characteristics of the other\nPhilippine examples known to me. Similar skulls have been received\nonly from caves, which exist in one of the little rocky islands east\nfrom Luzon. They suggest most Kanaka crania from Hawaii, and Moriori\ncrania from Chatham islands, and they raise the question whether\nthey do not belong to a migration period long before the time of\nthe Malays. I have, on various occasions, mentioned this probable\npre-Malayan, or at least proto-Malayan, population which stands in\nnearest relation to the settling of Polynesia. Here I will merely\nmention that the Polynesian sagas bring the progenitor from the west,\nand that the passage between Halmahera (Gilolo) and the Philippines\nis pointed out as the course of invasion.",
        "At any rate, it is quite probable that the skulls from Lanang,\nCragaray, and other Philippine Islands are the remains of a very old,\nif not autochthonous, prehistoric layer of population. The present\nmountain tribes have furnished no close analogies. As to the Igorots,\nwhich Blumentritt attributes to the first invasion, I refer to my\ndescription given on the ground of chronological investigations;\naccording to the account given by Hans Meyer the disposal of the dead\nin log coffins and in caves still goes on. Of the skulls themselves,\nnone were brachycephalous; on the contrary, they exhibit platyrrhine\nand in part decidedly pithecoid noses. On the whole, I came to the\nconclusion, as did earlier Quatrefages and Hamy, that [Indications of\npre-Malay invasion.] “they stand next in comparison with the Dayaks\nof Borneo,” but I hold yet the impression that they belong to a very\nold, probably pre-Malay, immigration.",
        "When, on the 18th of March, 1897, I made a communication on the\npopulation of the Philippines, a bloody uprising had broken out\neverywhere against the existing Spanish rule. In this uprising a\ncertain portion of the population, and indeed that which had the\nmost valid claim to aboriginality, the so-called Negritos, were not\ninvolved. Their isolation, their lack of every sort of political,\noften indeed of village organization, also their meager numbers,\nrender it conceivable that the greatest changes might go on among\ntheir neighbors without their taking such a practical view of them\nas to lead to their engaging in them. Thus it can be understood how\nthey would take no interest in the further development of the affair.",
        "Since then the result of the war between Spain and the Americans has\nbeen the destruction of Spanish power, and the treaty of Paris brought\nthe entire Philippine Archipelago into the possession of the United\nStates of America. Henceforth the principal interest is centered\nupon the deportment of the insurgents, who have not only outlived\nthe great war between the powers, but are now determined to assert,\nor win, their independence from the conquerors. These insurgents, who\nfor brevity are called Filipinos, belong, as I have remarked, to the\nlight-colored race of so-called Indios, who are sharply differentiated\nfrom the Negritos. Their ethnological position is difficult to fix,\nsince numerous mixtures have taken place with immigrant whites,\nespecially with Spaniards, but also with people of yellow and of\nbrown races–that is, with Mongols and Chinese. Perhaps here and\nthere the importance of this mixture on the composite type of the\nIndios has been overestimated; at least in most places positive\nproof is not forthcoming that foreign blood has imposed itself upon\nthe bright-colored population. Both history and tradition teach, on\nthe contrary, as also the study of the physical peculiarities of the\npeople that among the various tribes differences exist which suggest\nfamily traits. To this effect is the testimony of several travelers\nwho have followed one another during a long period of time, as has\nbeen developed especially by Blumentritt.",
        "[All immigrations from the West.] In this connection it must not\nbe overlooked that all these immigrations, howsoever many they be\nsupposed to have been, must have come this way from the west. Indeed,\na noteworthy migration from the east is entirely barred out, if we\nlook no farther back than the Chinese and Japanese. On the contrary,\nall signs point to the assumption that from of old, long before the\ncoming of Portuguese and Spaniards, a strong movement had gone on\nfrom this region to the east, and that the great sea way which exists\nbetween Mindanao and the Sulu islands on the north and Halmahera\nand the Moluccas in the south was the entrance road along which\nthose tribes, or at least those navigators whose arrival peopled\nthe Polynesian Islands, found their way into the Pacific Ocean. But\nalso the movement of the Polynesians points to the west, and if their\nancestors may have come from Indonesia there is no doubt that in their\nlong journeys eastward they must have touched at the coasts of other\nislands on their way, especially the Philippines. Polynesian invasions\nof the Philippines are not supposed to have closed when a migration of\npeoples or of men passing out to the Pacific Ocean laid the foundation\nof a large fraction of the population of the archipelago. It is known\nthat now and then single canoes from the Pelew or the Ladrone Islands\nwere driven upon the east coast of Luzon, but their importance ought\nnot to be overestimated. The migration this way from the west must\nhenceforth remain as the point of departure for all explanations of\nthis eastern ethnology. (These statements are well enough for working\nhypotheses, but actual proofs are not at hand. Ratzel, Berl. Verhandl.,\netc., Phil. Hist. Class, 1898, I., p. 33.–Translator.)",
        "Now, how are the local differences of various tribes to be\nexplained, when on the whole the place of origin was the same? Is\nthere here a secondary variation of the type, something brought\nabout through climate, food, circumstances? It is a large theme,\nwhich, unfortunately, is too often dominated by previously-formed\ntheories. The importance of “environment” and mode of life upon\nthe corporeal development of man can not be contested, but the\nmeasure of this importance is very much in doubt. Nowhere is this\nmeasure, at least in the present consideration, less known than in the\nPhilippines. In spite of wide geological and biological differences on\nthese islands, there exists a close anthropological agreement of the\nIndios in the chief characteristics, and the effort to trace back the\ntribal differences that have been marked to climatic and alimentary\ncauses has not succeeded. The influence of inherited peculiarities\nis also more mighty here, as in most parts of the earth, than that of\n\"milieu.”",
        "If we assume, first, that the immigrants brought their peculiarities\nwith them, which were fixed already when they came, we must also accept\nas self-evident that the Negritos of the Philippines do not belong\nto the same stock as the more powerful, bright-colored Indios. As\nlong as these islands have been known, more than three centuries,\nthe skin of the Negritos has been dark brown, almost black, their\nhair short and spirally twisted, and just as long has the skin\nof the Indios been brownish, in various shades, relatively clear,\nand the hair has been long and arranged in wavy locks. At no time,\nso far as known, has it been discovered that among a single family\na pronounced variation from these peculiarities had taken place. On\nthis point there is entire unanimity. In case of the Negritos there is\nnot the least doubt; of the Indios a doubt may arise, for, in fact,\nthe shades of skin color appear greatly varied, since the brown is\nat times quite blackish, at times yellowish, almost as varied as is\nthe color of the sunburnt hair. But even then the practiced eye easily\ndetects the descent, and if the skin alone is not sufficient the first\nglance at the hair completes the diagnosis. The correct explanation\nof individual or tribal variations is difficult only with the Indios,\nwhile no such necessity exists in the case of the Negritos. But among\nthe Indios these individual and tribal variations are so frequent\nand so outspoken that one is justified in making the inquiry whether\nthere has not developed here a new type of inherited peculiarities. If\nthis were the case, it must still be held that already the immigrant\ntribes had possessed them.",
        "[Assistance from history.] Now, history records that different\nimmigrations have actually taken place. Laying aside the latest\nbefore the arrival of the Spaniards, that of the Islamites, in\nthe fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries, there remains the\nolder one. If ethnologists and travelers in general come to the\nconclusion concerning Borneo–and it is to be taken as certain–that\nthe differences now existing among the wild tribes of this island are\nvery old, it ought not be thought so wonderful if, according to the\nconditions of the tribes which have immigrated thence, there should\nexist on the Philippines near one another dissimilar though related\npeoples. This difference is not difficult to recognize in manners and\ncustoms–a side of the discussion which is further on to be treated\nmore fully. We begin with physical characteristics.",
        "[Hair differences.] Among these the hair occupies the chief\nplace. To be sure, among all the Indios it is black, but it shows\nnot the slightest approach to the frizzled condition which is such\na prominent feature in the external appearance of the Negritos and\nof all the Papuan tribes of the East. This frizzled condition may be\ncalled woolly, or in somewhat exaggerated refinement in the name may\nbe attributed to the term “wool,” all sorts of meanings akin to wool;\nin every case there is wanting to all the Indios the crinkling of the\nhair from its exit out of the follicle, whereby would result wide\nor narrow spiral tubes and the coarse appearance of the so-called\n\"peppercorn.” The hair of all Indios is smooth and straightened out,\nand when it forms curves they are only feeble, and they make the\nwhole outward appearance wavy or, at most, curled.",
        "But within this wavy or curled condition of the hair there are again\ndifferences. In my former communication I have attended to examinations\nwhich I made upon a large number of islands in the Malay Sea, and in\nwhich it was shown that a certain area exists which begins with the\nMoluccas and extends to the Sunda group, in which the hair shows a\nstrong inclination to form wavy locks, indeed passes gradually into\ncrinkled, if not into spiral, rolls. Such hair is found specially\nin the interior of the islands, where the so-called aboriginal\npopulation is purer and where for a long time the name of Alfuros\nhas been conferred on them. On most points affinity with Negritos or\nPapuans is not to be recognized. Should such at any time have existed,\nwe are a long way from the period when the direct causes therefor are\nto be looked for. In this connection the study of the Philippines is\nrich with instruction. In the limits of the almost insular, isolated\nNegrito enclave, mixtures between Negritos and Indios very seldom\nsurprise one, and never the transitions that can have arisen in the\npost-generative time of development. (The island of Negros, on the\ncontrary, is peopled by such crossbreeds.–Translator.)",
        "If there are among the bright-colored islanders of the Indian Ocean\nAlfuros and Malays close together there is nothing against coming upon\nthis contrast in the Philippine population also. Among the more central\npeoples the tribal differences are so great that almost every explorer\nstumbles on the question of mixture. There not only the Dayaks and the\nother Malays obtrude themselves, but also the Chinese and the Mongolian\npeoples of Farther India. Indeed, many facts are known, chiefly\nin the language, the religion, the domestic arts, the agriculture,\nthe pastoral life which remind one of known conditions peculiarly\nIndian. The results of the ethnologists are so tangled here that one\nhas to be cautious when one or another of them draws conclusions\nconcerning immigrations, because of certain local or territorial\nspecializations. Of course, when a Brahmanic custom occurs anywhere\nit is right to conclude that it came here from India. But before\nassuming that the tribe in which such a custom prevails itself comes\nfrom Hither or Farther India, the time has to be ascertained to which\nthe custom is to be traced back. The chronological evidence leads to\nthe confident belief that the custom and the tribe immigrated together.",
        "[Ancestor worship.] Over the whole Philippine Archipelago\nreligious customs have changed with the progress of external\nrelations. Christianity has in many places spread its peculiar customs,\nobservances, and opinions, and changed entirely the direction of\nthought. On closer view are to be detected in the midst of Christian\nactivities older survivals, as ingredients of belief which, in\nspite of that religion, have not vanished. Before Christianity, in\nmany places, Islam flourished, and it is not surprising to witness,\nas on Mindanao, Christian and Mohammedan beliefs side by side. But,\nbefore Islam, ancestor worship, as has long been known, was widely\nprevalent. In almost every locality, every hut has its Anito with\nits special place, its own dwelling; there are Anito pictures and\nimages, certain trees and, indeed, certain animals in which some\nAnito resides. The ancestor worship is as old as history, for the\ndiscoverers of the Philippines found it in full bloom, and rightly\nhas Blumentritt characterized Anito worship as the ground form of\nPhilippine religion. He has also furnished numerous examples of Anito\ncult surviving in Christian communities.",
        "Chronology has a good groundwork and it will have to observe every\nfootprint of vanishing creeds. Only, it must not be overlooked that\nthe beginning of the chronology of religion has not been reached,\nand that the origin of the generally diffused ancestor worship, at\nleast on the Philippines, is not known. If it is borne in mind that\nbelief in Anitos is widely diffused in Polynesia and in purely Malay\nareas, the drawing of certain conclusions therefrom concerning the\nprehistory of the Philippines is to be despaired of.",
        "[Tattooing.] Next to religious customs, among wild tribes fashions\nare most enduring. Little of costume is to be seen, indeed, among\nthem. Therefore, here tattooing asserts its sway. The more it has\nbeen studied in late years the more valuable has been the information\nin deciding the kinship relations of tribes. Unfortunately, in the\nPhilippines the greater part of the early tattoo designs have been\nlost and the art itself is also nearly eliminated. But since the\njourney of Carl Semper it has been known that not only Malays but\nalso Negritos tattoo; indeed, this admirable explorer has decided\nthat the “Negroes of the East Coast” practice a different method of\ntattooing from that of the Mariveles in the west, and on that account\nthey attain different results. In the one case a needle is employed\nto make fine holes in the skin in which to introduce the color; in\nthe other long gashes are made. In the latter case prominent scars\nresult; in the former a smooth pattern. But these combined patterns\nare on the whole the same, instead of rectilinear figures. Schadenburg\nhas the operations commence with a sharpened bamboo on children 10\nyears of age. Among the wild tribes of the light-colored population\ntattooing is not less diffused, but the patterns are not alike in the\ndifferent tribes. Isabelo de los Reyes reports that the Tinguianes,\nwho inhabit the mountain forests of the northern cordilleras of Luzon,\nproduce figures of stars, snakes, birds, etc., on children 7 to 9 years\nold. Hans Meyer describes the pattern of the Igorots. There appears to\nexist a great variety of symbols; for example, on the arms, straight\nand crooked lines crossing one another; on the breast, feather-like\npatterns. Least frequently he saw the so-called Burik designs, which\nextended in parallel bands across the breast, the back, and calves,\nand give to the body the appearance of a sailor’s striped jacket. It\nis very remarkable that the human form never occurs.",
        "What is true concerning tattooing on so many Polynesian islands\nholds also completely here. But reliable descriptions are so few,\nand especially there is such a meager number of useful drawings,\nthat it would not repay the trouble to assemble the scattered data. At\nleast it will suffice to discover whether among them there are genuine\ntribal marks or to investigate concerning the distribution of separate\npatterns. Those known show conclusively that in the matter of tattooing\nthe Filipinos are not differentiated from the islanders of the Pacific;\nthey form, moreover, an important link in the chain of knowledge\nwhich demonstrates the genetic homogeneity of the inhabitants. The\ntattooings of the eastern islanders are comparable only to those of\nAfrican aborigines, with which last they furnish many family marks,\nmade out and recognized. It is desirable that a trustworthy collection\nof all patterns be collected before the method becomes more altered\nor destroyed.",
        "[Teeth alterations.] Next to the skin, among the wild tribes the\nteeth are modified in the most numerous artificial alterations. The\npreferable custom, common in Africa, of breaking out the front\nteeth in greater or less number has not, so far as I remember, been\ndescribed among the Filipinos; I only mention that while I was making a\nrevision of our Philippine crania, two of them turned up in which the\nmiddle upper incisors had evidently been broken out for a long time,\nfor the alveolar border had shrunk into a small quite smooth ridge,\nwithout a trace of an aveolus. It is otherwise with the pointing of\nthe incisors, especially the upper ones, which, also is not common. I\nmust leave it undecided whether the sharpening is done by filing or by\nbreaking off pieces from the sides. The latter should be in general\nfar more frequent. In every case the otherwise broad and flat teeth\nare brought to such sharp points as to project like those of the\ncarnivorous animals. I have met with this condition several times\non Negrito skulls and furnished illustrations of them. On a Zambal\nskull, excavated by Dr. A. B. Meyer and which I lay before you,\nthe deformation is easy to be seen. I called attention at the time\nto the fact that among the Malays an entirely different method of\nmodifying the teeth is in vogue, in which a horizontal filing on the\nfront surface is practiced and the sharp lower edge is straightened\nand widened. Already the elder Thévenot has accented this contrast\nwhen he says:",
        "“These cause the teeth to be equal, those file them to points, giving\nthem the shape of a saw.”",
        "This difference appears to have held on till the present; at least\nno skull of an Indio is known to me with similar deformation of the\nteeth. This custom of the Negritos is so much more remarkable since\nthe chipping of the corners of the teeth is widely spread among the\nAfrican blacks.",
        "[Skill flattening.] The other part of the body used most for\ndeformation–the skull–is in strong contrast to the last-named\ncustom. Deformed crania; especially from older times, are quite\nnumerous in the Philippines; probably they belong exclusively to\nthe Indios. If they exist among the Negritos, I do not know it; the\nonly exception comes from the Tinguianes, of whom I. de los Reyes\nreports their skulls are flattened behind (por detrás oprimido). Such\nflattening is found, however, not seldom among tribes who have the\npractice of binding children on hard cradle boards–chiefly among those\nfamilies who keep their infants a long time on such contrivances. A\nsure mark by which to discriminate accidental pressure of this sort\nfrom one intentionally produced is not at hand; it may be that\nin accidental deformation oblique position of the deformed spot\nis more frequent; at any rate, the difference in the Philippines\nis a very striking one, since there not so much the occiput as the\nfront and middle portions suffer from the disfigurements, and thereby\ndeformations are produced that have had their most perfect expression\namong the ancient Peruvians and other American tribes.",
        "I have discussed cranial deformation of the Americans in\ngreater detail, where I exhibit the accidental and the artificial\n(intentional) deformation in their principal forms. The result is that\nin large sections of America scarcely any ancient skulls are found\nhaving their natural forms, but that the practice of deformation\nhas not been general; moreover, a number of deformation centers\nmay be differentiated which stand in no direct association with\none another. The Peruvian center is far removed from that of the\nnorthwest coast, and this again from that of the Gulf States. From\nthis it must not be said that each center may have had its own, as\nit were, autochthonous origin. But the method has not so spread that\nits course can be followed immediately. Rather is the supposition\nconfirmed that the method is to be traced to some other time,\ntherefore that somewhere there must have been a place of origin for\nit. On the Eastern Hemisphere, and especially in the region here\nunder consideration, the relations are apparently otherwise. Here\nexist, so far as known, great areas entirely free from deformation;\nsmall ones, on the other hand, full of it. There are here, also,\ndeformation centers, but only a few. Among these, with our present\nknowledge, the Philippines occupy the first place.",
        "The knowledge of this, indeed, is not of long duration. Public\nattention was first aroused about thirty years ago concerning\nskulls from Samar and Luzon, gathered by F. Jagor from ancient\ncaves, to furnish the proof of their deformation. Up to that time\nnext to nothing was known of deformed crania in the oriental island\nworld. First through my publication the attention of J. G. Riedel,\na most observant Dutch resident, was called to the fact that cranial\ndeformation is still practiced in the Celebes, and he was so good as to\nsend us a specimen of the compressing apparatus for delicate infants\n(1874). Compressed crania were also found. But the number was small\nand the compression of the separate specimens was only slight. In\nboth respects what was observed in the Sunda islands did not differ\nfrom the state of the case in the Philippines. Through Jagor’s\ncollections different places had become known where deformed crania\nwere buried. Since then the number of localities has multiplied. I\nshall mention only two, on account of their peculiar locality. One is\nCagraray, a small island east of Luzon, in the Pacific Ocean, at the\nentrance of the Bay of Albay; the other, the island of Marinduque,\nin the west, between Luzon and Mindoro. From the last-named island I\nsaw, ten years ago, the first picture of one in a photograph album\naccidentally placed in my hands. Since then I had opportunity to\nexamine the Schadenberg collection of crania, lately come into the\npossession of the Reichsmuseum, in Leyden, and to my great delight\ndiscovered in it a series of skulls which are compressed in exactly\nthe same fashion as those of Lanang. It is said that these will soon\nbe described in a publication.",
        "It is of especial interest that this method has been noted in the\nPhilippines for more than three hundred years. In my first publication\nI cited a passage in Thévenot where he says, on the testimony of a\npriest, that the natives on some islands had the custom of compressing\nthe head of a newborn child between two boards, so that it would be\nno longer round, but lengthened out; also they flattened the forehead,\nwhich they looked upon as a special mark of beauty. This is, therefore,\nan ancient example. It is confirmed by the circumstance that these\ncrania are found especially in caves, from the roofs of which mineral\nwaters have dripped, which have overlaid the bones partly with a thick\nlayer of calcareous matter. The bones themselves have an uncommonly\nthick, almost ivory, fossil-like appearance. Only the outer surface\nis in places corroded, and on these places saturated with a greenish\ninfiltration. It is to be assumed, therefore, that they are very old. I\nhave the impression that they must have been placed here before the\ndiscovery of the islands and the introduction of Christianity. Their\npeculiar appearance, especially their angular form and the thickness\nof the bone, reminds one of crania from other parts of the South Sea,\nespecially those from Chatham and Sandwich Islands. I shall not here\ngo further into this question, but merely mention that I came to the\nconclusion that these people must be looked upon as proto-Malayan.",
        "[Hope of Filipino and American study.] The changes which will take\nplace in the political condition of the Philippines may be of little\nservice to scientific explorations at first; but the study of the\npopulation will be surely taken up with renewed energy. Already\nin America scholars have begun to occupy themselves therewith. A\nbrief article by Dr. Brinton is to be mentioned as the first sign of\nthis. But should the ardent desire of the Filipinos be realized, that\ntheir islands *hould have political autonomy, it is to be hoped that,\nout of the patriotic enthusiasm of the population and the scientific\nspirit of many of their best men, new sources of information will be\nopened for the history and the development of oriental peoples. To\nthis end it may be here mentioned, by the way, that the connecting\nlinks of ancient Philippine history and the customs of these islands,\nas well with the Melanesians as with the Polynesians of the south,\nare yet to be discovered.",
        "As representatives of these two groups, I present, in closing, two\nespecially well-formed crania from the Philippines. One of them,\nwhich shows the marks of antiquity that I have set forth, belongs\nto an “Indio.” [Comparison of Indio and Negrito skulls.] It has\nthe high cranial capacity of 1,540 cubic centimeters, a horizontal\ncircumference of 525 millimeters, and a sagitta-circumference of\n386 millimeters; its form is hypsidolicho, quite on the border of\nmesocephaly: Index of width, 75.3; index of height, 76.3. Besides,\nit has the appearance of a race capable of development; only, the\nnose is platyrrhine (index, 52.3), as among so many Malay tribes, and\nin the left temple it bears a Processus frontalis squamae temporalis\ndeveloped partly from an enlarged fontanelle. The other skull was one\ntaken from a Negrito grave of Zambales by Dr. A. B. Meyer. It makes,\nat first glance, just as favorable an impression, but its capacity\nis only 1,182 cubic centimeters; therefore 358 cubic centimeters less\nthan the other. Its form is orthobrachycephalic; breadth index, 80.2;\nheight index, 70.6. As in single traits of development, so in the\nmeasurements, the difference and the debased character of this race\nobtrude themselves. Only, the nasal index is somewhat smaller; on the\nwhole, the nose has in its separate parts a decidedly pithecoid form.",

        "Blackwood’s magazine for August, 1818, has an account of conditions\nin Manila and the Philippines from data given by an English merchant\nwho left the Islands in 1798 after twenty years’ residence in which\nhe accumulated a fortune.",
        "“Your first question, with respect to the Spanish population, must\nrefer to native Spaniards only; as their numerous descendants, through\nall the variety of half-castes, would include one third at least of\nthe whole population of Luconia (i.e., Luzon–A. C.)",
        "“Of native Spaniards, accordingly, settled in the Philippine Islands,\nthe total number may be stated at 2,000 not military. The military,\nincluding all descriptions, men and officers, are about 2,500,\nout of which number the native regiments are officered These last,\nin 1796-7, were almost entirely composed of South Americans and were\nreckoned at 5,000 men, making a military force of about 7,500.",
        "“The castes bearing a mixture of the Spanish blood are in Luconia\nalone at least 200,000. The Sangleys, or Chinese descendants, are\nupwards of 20,000, and Indians, who call themselves the original\nTagalas, about 340,000, making a total population in that island of\nabout 600,000 souls. What may be the respective numbers in the other\nPhilippine Islands I never had any opportunity of learning.”",
        "(This opinion, of a day when it was not desired to disparage the\npeople, gives an idea of the mixed blood of the Filipinos which, in the\nopinion of the ethnologists, like Ratzel, is a source of strength. It\nclasses them with the English and Americans. One danger of the present\nappears in over-emphasizing the Malay blood, just as in Spanish times\na real loss seems to have come from the contempt toward the Chinese\nwhich led to minimizing and concealing a most creditable ancestry.",
        "Prejudice in the past called all trouble makers mestizos, but today’s\nstudy is showing that trouble maker meant man who would stand up for\nhis rights; one must not forget that mestizo was used as a reproach,\nthat the leaders of the people were really typical of the people.

It also shows a fairness to the people\nuncommon in the Spanish-inspired writings of his day.",
        "“Dull indeed must be his soul, unsympathetic his nature who can see\nthe forests and mountains of Luzon, Queen of the Eastern Isles, fade\naway into dim violet outlines on the fast receding horizon without\nsome pang of longing regret.

Pity that for the Philippines no word\nlimner of note exists. The chiefest, the almost exceptional spell of\nthe Philippines, is situated, not in the lake or volcano, forest or\nplain, but in the races that form the bulk of the island population.",
        "“I said ’almost exceptional’ because rarely is an intra-tropical\npeople a satisfactory one to eye or mind. But this cannot be\nsaid of the Philippine Malays who in bodily formation and mental\ncharacteristics alike, may fairly claim a place, not among middling\nones merely, but among almost the higher names inscribed on the world’s\nnational scale. A concentrated, never-absent self-respect, an habitual\nself-restraint in word and deed, very rarely broken except when extreme\nprovocation induces the transitory but fatal frenzy known as ’amok,’\nand an inbred courtesy, equally diffused through all classes, high or\nlow, unfailing decorum, prudence, caution, quiet cheerfulness, ready\nhospitality and a correct, though not inventive taste. His family is\na pleasing sight, much subordination and little constraint, unison in\ngradation, liberty–not license. Orderly children, respected parents,\nwomen subject but not oppressed, men ruling but not despotic, reverence\nwith kindness, obedience in affection, these form lovable pictures,\nnot by any means rare in the villages of the eastern isles.” (Here\nagain comes the necessity of combatting the popular impression that the\nPhilippines is a tropical land peopled by Malays. The modification of\nclimate from being an ocean archipelago suggests that these islands are\nreally subtropical, while mixture of blood joined with three centuries\nof European civilization makes the term Malay misleading.–C.)",

        "[244] From December 1853 to November 1854 the colony possessed four\ncaptains-general (two effective and two provisional). In 1850 a new\nnominee, Oidor (member of the Supreme Court of Judicature) who with\nhis family voyaged to Manila by the Cape, found, upon his arrival,\nhis successor already in office, the latter having travelled by way\nof Suez.

For ten\nyears past the Minister of Finance has not remained in office longer\nthan two months; and since that time, particularly since 1868, the\nchanges have followed one another with still greater rapidity.",
        "[245] The reason of this premiun on silver was, that the Chinese bought\nup all the Spanish and Mexican dollars, in order to send them to China,\nwhere they are worth more than other dollars, being known from the\nvoyage of the galleon thither in olden times, and being current in\nthe inland provinces. (The highest price there can be obtained for\na Carlos III.)",
        "A mint erected in Manila since that time, which at least supports\nitself, if the govenment has derived no other advantage from it, has\nremoved this difficulty. The Chinese are accustomed to bring gold\nand silver as currency, mixed also with foreign coinage, to Manila\nfor the purpose of buying the produce of the country; and all this the\nnative merchants had recoined. At first only silver ounces were usually\nobtainable in Manila, gold ounces very rarely. This occasioned such a\nsteady importation that the conditions were completely reversed. In\nthe Insular Treasury the gold and silver dollar are always reckoned\nat the same value.",

        "[254] No single people in Europe can in any way compare with the\ninhabitants of California, which, in the early years of its existence,\nwas composed only of men in the prime of their strength and activity,\nwithout aged people, without women, and without children. Their\nactivity, in a country where everything had to be provided (no\ncivilised neighbors living within some hundred miles or so), and\nwhere all provisions were to be obtained only at a fabulous cost,\nwas stimulated to the highest pitch. Without here going into the\nparticulars of their history, it need only be remembered that they\nfounded, in twenty-five years, a powerful State, the fame of which has\nspread all over the world, and around whose borders young territories\nhave sprung into existence and flourished vigorously; two of them\nindeed having attained to the condition of independent States. After\nthe Californian gold-diggers had changed the configuration of the\nground of entire provinces by having, with Titanic might, deposited\nmasses of earth into the sea until they expanded into hilly districts,\nso as to obtain therefrom, with the aid of ingenious machinery, the\nsmallest particle of gold which was contained therein, they have\nastonished the world in their capacity of agriculturalists, whose\nproduce is sent even to the most distant markets, and everywhere takes\nthe first rank without dispute. Such mighty results have been achieved\nby a people whose total number scarcely, indeed, exceeds 500,000; and\ntherefore, perhaps, they may not find it an easy matter to withstand\nthe competition of the Chinese.",

        "(The translator of the 1875 London edition notes: “This statement is\nincorrect, so far as the fact of the feat being accomplished by Chinese\nis concerned. Eight Europeans were engaged in this extraordinary\npiece of work. During the rejoicings which took place in Sacramento\nupon the opening of the line, these men were paraded in a van, with\nthe account of their splendid achievement painted in large letters\non the outside. Certainly not one of them was a Chinaman.\"–C.",

        "[260] According to Morga (p. 140) there was neither king nor governor,\nbut in each island and province were numerous persons of rank, whose\ndependants and subjects were divided into quarters (barrios) and\nfamilies. These petty rulers had to render homage by means of tributes\nfrom the crops (buiz), also by socage or personal service: but their\nrelations were exempted from such services as were rendered by the\nplebeians (timauas). The dignities of the chieftains were hereditary,\ntheir honors descended also to their wives. If a chief particularly\ndistinguished himself, then the rest followed him; but the Government\nretained to themselves the administration of the Barangays through\ntheir own particular officials. Concerning the system of slavery\nunder the native rule, Morga says (p. 41, abbreviated),–\"The natives\nof these islands are divided into three classes–nobles, timauas or\nplebeians, and the slaves of the former. There are different sorts\nof slaves: some in complete slavery (Saguiguilires), who work in\nthe house, as also their children. Others live with their families\nin their own houses and render service to their lords at sowing and\nharvest-time, also as boatmen, or in the construction of houses,\netc. They must attend as often as they are required, and give their\nservices without pay or recompense of any kind. They are called\nNamarnahayes; and their duties and obligations descend to their\nchildren and successors. Of these Saguiguilires and Namamahayes a\nfew are full slaves, some half slaves, and others quarter slaves.",
        "When, for instance, the mother or father was free, the only son\nwould be half free, half slave. Supposing there were several sons,\nthe first one inherits the father’s position, the second that of the\nmother. When the number is unequal the last one is half free and half\nslave; and the descendants born of such half slayes and those who are\nfree are quarter slaves. The half slaves, whether or narnamahayes,\nserve their lords equally every month in turns. Half and quarter slaves\ncan, by reason of their being partially free, compel their lord to\ngive them their freedom at a previously determined and unfluctuating\nprice: but full slaves do not possess this right. A namamahaye is\nworth half as much as a saguiguilire. All slaves are natives.”",
        "Again, at p. 143, he writes:–\"A slave who has children by her lord\nis thereby freed together with her children. The latter, however,\nare not considered well born, and cannot inherit property; nor do the\nrights of nobility, supposing in such a case the father to possess any,\ndescend to them.”",

The\njudiciously abbreviated English translation, however, contains many\nmiscomprehensions.",

        "[265] Danger to Europeans, “Massacre of all white people,” was a\nfrequent Spanish allegation in political disturbances, but the only\nproof ever given (the 9th degree Masonic apron stupidly attributed\nto the Katipunan in 1896) was absurd and irrelevant.–C.",

        "[267] I take the liberty, here, of citing an instance of this. In 1861,\nwhen I found myself on the West Coast of Mexico, a dozen backwoods\nfamilies determined upon settling in Sonora (forming an oasis in\nthe desert); a plan which was frustrated by the invasion at that\ntime of the European powers. Many native farmers awaited the arrival\nof these immigrants in order to settle under their protection. The\nvalue of land in consequence of the announcement of the project rose\nvery considerably.",
