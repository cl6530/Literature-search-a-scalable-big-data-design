        "Adelaide did not reach home until the troubles with and through Charles\nWhitney were settled, and Arthur and Dory were deep in carrying out the\nplans to make the mills and factories part of the university and not\nmerely its property. When Scarborough’s urgent cable came, Dory found\nthat all the steamers were full. Adelaide could go with him only by\ntaking a berth in a room with three women in the bottom of the ship.\n“Impossible accommodations,” thought he, “for so luxurious a person and\nso poor a sailor\"; and he did not tell her that this berth could be had.\n“You’ll have to wait a week or so,” said he. “As you can’t well stay on\nhere alone, why not accept Mrs. Whitney’s invitation to join her?”",
        "Adelaide disliked Mrs. Whitney, but there seemed to be no alternative.\nMrs. Whitney was at Paris, on the way to America after the wedding and a\nsevere cure at Aix and an aftercure in Switzerland. She had come for the\nfinishing touches of rejuvenation–to get her hair redone and to go\nthrough her biennial agony of having Auguste, beauty specialist to the\nroyalty, nobility and fashion, and demimonde, of three continents, burn\noff her outer skin that nature might replace it with one new and fresh\nand unwrinkled. She was heavily veiled as she and Adelaide traveled down\nto Cherbourg to the steamer. As soon as she got aboard she retired to her\nroom and remained hidden there during the voyage, seen only by her maid,\nher face covered day and night with Auguste’s marvelous skin-coaxing\nmask. Adelaide did not see her again until the morning of the last day,\nwhen she appeared on deck dressed beautifully and youthfully for the\nshore, her skin as fair and smooth as a girl’s, and looking like an elder\nsister of Adelaide’s–at a distance.",
        "She paused in New York; Adelaide hastened to Saint X, though she was\nlooking forward uneasily to her arrival because she feared she would have\nto live at the old Hargrave house in University Avenue. Miss Skeffington\nruled there, and she knew Miss Skeffington–one of those old-fashioned\nold maids whose rigid ideas of morality extend to the ordering of\npersonal habits in minutest detail. Under her military sway everyone had\nto rise for breakfast at seven sharp, had to dine exactly at noon, sup\nwhen the clock struck the half hour after five. Ingress and egress for\nmembers of the family was by the side door only, the front door being\nreserved for company. For company also was the parlor, and for company\nthe front stairs with their brilliant carpet, new, though laid for the\nfirst time nearly a quarter of a century before; for company also was the\nbest room in the house, which ought to have been attractive, but was a\nlittle damp from being shut up so much, and was the cause of many a cold\nto guests. “I simply can’t stand it to live by the striking of clocks!\"\nthought Adelaide. “I must do something! But what?”",
        "Her uneasiness proved unnecessary, however. Dory disappointed his aunt,\nof a new and interestingly difficult spirit to subdue, by taking rooms at\nthe Hendricks Hotel until they should find a place of their own. Mrs.\nRanger asked them to live with her; but Adelaide shrank from putting\nherself in a position where her mother and Arthur could, and her\nsister-in-law undoubtedly would, “know too much about our private\naffairs.” Mrs. Ranger did not insist. She would not admit it to herself,\nbut, while she worshiped Del and thought her even more beautiful than she\nwas, and just about perfection in every way, still Madelene was more\nsatisfactory for daily companionship. Also, Ellen doubted whether two\nsuch positive natures as Madelene’s and Adelaide’s would be harmonious\nunder the same roof. “What’s more,” she reflected, “there may be a\nbaby–babies.”",
        "Within a fortnight of Del’s return, and before she and Dory had got\nquite used to each other again, she fixed on an abode. “Mrs. Dorsey was\nhere this afternoon,” said she, with enthusiasm which, to Dory’s acute\nperceptions, seemed slightly exaggerated, in fact, forced, “and offered\nus her house for a year, just to have somebody in it whom she could trust\nto look after things. You know she’s taking her daughter abroad to\nfinish. It was too good a chance to let pass; so I accepted at once.”",
        "Dory turned away abruptly. With slow deliberation he took a cigarette\nfrom his case, lighted it, watched the smoke drift out at the open\nwindow. She was observing him, though she seemed not to be. And his\nexpression made her just a little afraid. Unlike most men who lead\npurely intellectual lives, he had not the slightest suggestion of\nsexlessness; on the contrary, he seemed as strong, as positive\nphysically, as the look of his forehead and eyes showed him to be\nmentally. And now that he had learned to dress with greater care, out of\ndeference to her, she could find nothing about him to help her in\nprotecting herself by criticising him.",
        "“Do you think, Del,” said he, “that we’ll be able to live in that big\nplace on eighteen hundred a year?”",
        "It wasn’t as easy for him thus to remind her of their limited means as it\ntheoretically should have been. Del was distinctly an expensive-looking\nluxury. That dress of hers, pale green, with hat and everything to match\nor in harmony, was a “simple thing,” but the best dressmaker in the Rue\nde la Paix had spent a great deal of his costly time in producing that\neffect of simplicity. Throughout, she had the cleanness, the freshness,\nthe freedom from affectations which Dory had learned could be got only by\nlarge expenditure. Nor would he have had her any different. He wanted\njust the settings she chose for her fair, fine beauty. The only change he\nwould have asked would have been in the expression of those violet eyes\nof hers when they looked at him.",
        "“You wish I hadn’t done it!” she exclaimed. And if he had not glanced\naway so quickly he would have seen that she was ready to retreat.",
        "“Well, it’s not exactly the start I’d been thinking of,” replied he,\nreluctantly but tentatively.",
        "It is not in human nature to refuse to press an offered advantage. Said\nDel: “Can’t we close up most of the house–use only five or six rooms on\nthe ground floor? And Mrs. Dorsey’s gardener and his helpers will be\nthere. All we have to do is to see that they’ve not neglected the\ngrounds.” She was once more all belief and enthusiasm. “It seemed to me,\ntaking that place was most economical, and so comfortable. Really, Dory,\nI didn’t accept without thinking.”",
        "Dory was debating with himself: To take that house–it was one of those\ntrifles that are anything but trifles–like the slight but crucial motion\nat the crossroads in choosing the road to the left instead of the road to\nthe right. Not to take the house–Del would feel humiliated, reasoned he,\nwould think him unreasonably small, would chafe under the restraint their\nlimited means put upon them, whereas, if he left the question of living\non their income entirely to her good sense, she would not care about the\ndeprivations, would regard them as self-imposed.",
        "“Of course, if you don’t like it, Dory,” she now said, “I suppose Mrs.\nDorsey will let me off. But I’m sure you’d be delighted, once we got\nsettled. The house is so attractive–at least, I think I can make it\nattractive by packing away her showy stuff and rearranging the furniture.\nAnd the grounds–Dory, I don’t see how you can object!”",
        "Dory gave a shrug and a smile. “Well, go ahead. We’ll scramble through\nsomehow.” He shook his head at her in good-humored warning. “Only, please\ndon’t forget what’s coming at the end of your brief year of grandeur.”",
        "Adelaide checked the reply that was all but out. She hastily reflected\nthat it might not be wise to let him know, just then, that Mrs. Dorsey\nhad said they could have the house for two years, probably for three,\nperhaps for five. Instead, she said, “It isn’t the expense, after all,\nthat disturbs you, is it?”",
        "He smiled confession. “No.”",
        "“I know it’s snobbish of me to long for finery so much that I’m even\nwilling to live in another person’s and show off in it,” she sighed.\n“But–I’m learning gradually.”",
        "He colored. Unconsciously she had put into her tone–and this not for the\nfirst time, by any means–a suggestion that there wasn’t the slightest\ndanger of his wearying of waiting, that she could safely take her time in\ngetting round to sensible ideas and to falling in love with him. His eyes\nhad the look of the veiled amusement that deliberately shows through, as\nhe said, “That’s good. I’ll try to be patient.”",
        "It was her turn to color. But, elbowing instinctive resentment, came\nuneasiness. His love seemed to her of the sort that flowers in the\nromances–the love that endures all, asks nothing, lives forever upon its\nown unfed fire. As is so often the case with women whose charms move men\nto extravagance of speech and emotion, it was a great satisfaction to\nher, to her vanity, to feel that she had inspired this wonderful immortal\nflame; obviously, to feed such a flame by giving love for love would\nreduce it to the commonplace. All women start with these exaggerated\nnotions of the value of being loved; few of them ever realize and rouse\nthemselves, or are aroused, from their vanity to the truth that the value\nis all the other way. Adelaide was only the natural woman in blindly\nfancying that Dory was the one to be commiserated, in not seeing that she\nherself was a greater loser than he, that to return his love would not be\na concession but an acquisition. Most men are content to love, to compel\nwomen to receive their love; they prefer the passive, the receptive\nattitude in the woman, and are even bored by being actively loved in\nreturn; for love is exacting, and the male is impatient of exaction.\nAdelaide did not understand just this broad but subtle difference between\nDory and “most men\"–that he would feel that he was violating her were he\nto sweep her away in the arms of his impetuous released passion, as he\nknew he could. He felt that such a yielding was, after all, like the\ninert obedience of the leaf to the storm wind–that what he could compel,\nwhat women call love, would be as utterly without substance as an image\nin a mirror, indeed, would be a mere passive reflection of his own\nlove–all most men want, but worthless to him.",
        "Could it be that Dory’s love had become–no, not less, but less ardent?\nShe saw that he was deep in thought–about her, she assumed, with an\nunconscious vanity which would have excited the mockery of many who have\nmore vanity than had she, and perhaps with less excuse. In fact, he was\nnot thinking of her; having the ability to turn his mind completely where\nhe willed–the quality of all strong men, and the one that often makes\nthe weak-willed think them hard–he was revolving the vast and inspiring\nplans Arthur and he had just got into practical form–plans for new\nfactories and mills such as a university, professing to be in the\nforefront of progress need not be ashamed to own or to offer to its\nstudents as workshops. All that science has bestowed in the way of making\nlabor and its surroundings clean and comfortable, healthful and\nattractive, was to be provided; all that the ignorance and the\nshortsighted greediness of employers, bent only on immediate profits and\nkeeping their philanthropy for the smug penuriousness and degrading\nstupidity of charity, deny to their own self-respect and to justice for\ntheir brothers in their power. Arthur and he had wrought it all out, had\ndiscovered as a crowning vindication that the result would be profitable\nin dollars, that their sane and shrewd utopianism would produce larger\ndividends than the sordid and slovenly methods of their competitors. “It\nis always so. Science is always economical as well as enlightened and\nhumane,” Dory was thinking when Adelaide’s voice broke into his reverie.",
        "“You are right, Dory,” said she. “And I shall give up the house. I’ll go\nto see Mrs. Dorsey now.”",
        "“The house?–What–Oh, yes–well–no–What made you change?”",
        "She did not know the real reason–that, studying his face, the curve and\nset of his head, the strength of the personality which she was too apt to\ntake for granted most of the time because he was simple and free from\npretense, she had been reminded that he was not a man to be trifled with,\nthat she would better bestir herself and give more thought and attention\nto what was going on in that superbly shaped head of his–about her,\nabout her and him. “Oh, I don’t just know,” replied she, quite honestly.\n“It seems to me now that there’ll be too much fuss and care and–sham.\nAnd I intend to interest myself in your work. You’ve hardly spoken of\nit since I got back.”",
        "“There’s been so little time–”",
        "“You mean,” she interrupted, “I’ve been so busy unpacking my silly\ndresses and hats and making and receiving silly calls.”",
        "“Now you’re in one of your penitential moods,” laughed Dory. “And\nto-morrow you’ll wish you hadn’t changed about the house. No–that’s\nsettled. We’ll take it, and see what the consequences are.”",
        "Adelaide brightened. His tone was his old self, and she did want that\nhouse so intensely! “I can be useful to Dory there; I can do so much on\nthe social side of the university life. He doesn’t appreciate the value\nof those things in advancing a career. He thinks a career is made by work\nonly. But I’ll show him! I’ll make his house the center of the\nuniversity!”",
        "Mrs. Dorsey had “Villa d’Orsay” carved on the stone pillars of her great\nwrought-iron gates, to remind the populace that, while her late\nfather-in-law, “Buck” Dorsey, was the plainest of butchers and meat\npackers, his ancestry was of the proudest. With the rise of its “upper\nclass” Saint X had gone in diligently for genealogy, had developed\nreverence for “tradition” and “blood,” had established a Society of\nFamily Histories, a chapter of the Colonial Dames, another of Daughters\nof the Revolution, and was in a fair way to rival the seaboard cities in\ndevotion to the imported follies and frauds of “family.” Dory at first\nindulged his sense of humor upon their Dorsey or d’Orsay finery. It\nseemed to him they must choose between making a joke of it and having it\nmake a joke of them. But he desisted when he saw that it grated on Del\nfor him to speak of her and himself as “caretakers for the rich.” And\npresently his disposition to levity died of itself. It sobered and\ndisheartened and, yes, disgusted him as he was forced to admit to himself\nthe reality of her delight in receiving people in the great drawing room,\nof her content in the vacuous, time-wasting habits, of her sense of\nsuperiority through having at her command a troop of servants–Mrs.\nDorsey’s servants! He himself disliked servants about, hated to abet a\nfellow-being in looking on himself or herself as an inferior; and he\nregarded as one of the basest, as well as subtlest poisons of\nsnobbishness, the habit of telling others to do for one the menial,\npersonal things which can be done with dignity only by oneself. Once, in\nParis–after Besançon–Janet spoke of some of her aristocratic\nacquaintances on the other side as “acting as if they had always been\nused to everything; so different from even the best people at home.” Dory\nremembered how Adelaide promptly took her up, gave instance after\ninstance in proof that European aristocrats were in fact as vulgar in\ntheir satisfaction in servility as were the newest of the newly\naristocratic at home, but simply had a different way of showing it. “A\nmore vulgar way,” she said, Janet unable to refute her. “Yes, far more\nvulgar, Jen, because deliberately concealed; just as vanity that swells\nin secret is far worse than frank, childish conceit.”",
        "And now–These vanities of hers, sprung from the old roots which in Paris\nshe had been eager to kill and he was hoping were about dead, sprung in\nvigor and spreading in weedy exuberance! He often looked at her in sad\nwonder when she was unconscious of it. “What is the matter?” he would\nrepeat. “She is farther away than in Paris, where the temptation to this\nsort of nonsense was at least plausible.” And he grew silent with her and\nshut himself in alone during the evening hours which he could not spend\nat the university. She knew why, knew also that he was right, ceased to\nbore herself and irritate him with attempts to make the Villa d’Orsay the\nsocial center of the university. But she continued to waste her days in\nthe inane pastimes of Saint X’s fashionable world, though ashamed of\nherself and disgusted with her mode of life. For snobbishness is\nessentially a provincial vice, due full as much to narrowness as to\nignorance; and, thus, it is most potent in the small “set” in the small\ntown. In the city even the narrowest are compelled to at least an\noccasional glimpse of wider horizons; but in the small town only the\nvigilant and resolute ever get so much as a momentary point of view. She\ntold herself, in angry attempt at self-excuse, that he ought to take her\nin hand, ought to snatch her away from that which she had not the courage\nto give up of herself. Yet she knew she would hate him should he try to\ndo it. She assumed that was the reason he didn’t; and it was part of the\nreason, but a lesser part than his unacknowledged, furtive fear of what\nhe might discover as to his own feelings toward her, were there just then\na casting up and balancing of their confused accounts with each other.",
        "Both were relieved, as at a crisis postponed, when it became necessary\nfor him to go abroad again immediately. “I don’t see how you can\nleave,” said he, thus intentionally sparing her a painful effort in\nsaying what at once came into the mind of each.",
        "“We could cable Mrs. Dorsey,” she suggested lamely. She was at the Louis\nQuinze desk in the Louis Quinze sitting room, and her old gold negligee\nmatched in charmingly, and the whole setting brought out the sheen,\nfaintly golden, over her clear skin, the peculiarly fresh and intense\nshade of her violet eyes, the suggestion of gold in her thick hair, with\nits wan, autumnal coloring, such as one sees in a field of dead ripe\ngrain. She was doing her monthly accounts, and the showing was not\npleasant. She was a good housekeeper, a surprisingly good manager; but\nshe did too much entertaining for their income.",
        "Dory was too much occupied with the picture she made as she sat there to\nreply immediately. “I doubt,” he finally replied, “if she could arrange\nby cable for some one else whom she would trust with her treasures. No, I\nguess you’ll have to stay.”",
        "“I wish I hadn’t taken this place!” she exclaimed. It was the first\nconfession of what her real, her sane and intelligent self had been\nproclaiming loudly since the first flush of interest and pleasure in\nher “borrowed plumage” had receded. “Why do you let me make a fool\nof myself?”",
        "“No use going into that,” replied he, on guard not to take too seriously\nthis belated penitence. He was used to Del’s fits of remorse, so used to\nthem that he thought them less valuable than they really were, or might\nhave been had he understood her better–or, not bothered about trying to\nunderstand her. “I shan’t be away long, I imagine,” he went on, “and I’ll\nhave to rush round from England to France, to Germany, to Austria, to\nSwitzerland. All that would be exhausting for you, and only a little of\nthe time pleasant.”",
        "His words sounded to her like a tolling over the grave of that former\nfriendship and comradeship of theirs. “I really believe you’ll be glad to\nget away alone,” cried she, lips smiling raillery, eyes full of tears.",
        "“Do you think so?” said Dory, as if tossing back her jest. But both knew\nthe truth, and each knew that the other knew it. He was as glad to escape\nfrom those surroundings as she to be relieved of a presence which edged\non her other-self to scoff and rail and sneer at her. It had become\nbitterness to him to enter the gates of the Villa d’Orsay. His nerves\nwere so wrought up that to look about the magnificent but too\npalace-like, too hotel-like rooms was to struggle with a longing to run\namuck and pause not until he had reduced the splendor to smithereens. And\nin that injustice of chronic self-excuse which characterizes all human\nbeings who do not live by intelligently formed and intelligently executed\nplan, she was now trying to soothe herself with blaming him for her low\nspirits; in fact, they were wholly the result of her consciously unworthy\nmode of life, and of an incessant internal warfare, exhausting and\ndepressing. Also, the day would surely come when he would ask how she was\ncontriving to keep up such imposing appearances on their eighteen hundred\na year; and then she would have to choose between directly deceiving him\nand telling him that she had broken–no, not broken, that was too\nharsh–rather, had not yet fulfilled the promise to give up the income\nher father left her.",
        "After a constrained silence, “I really don’t need anyone to stop here\nwith me,” she said to him, as if she had been thinking of it and not of\nthe situation between them, “but I’ll get Stella Wilmot and her brother.”",
        "“Arden?” said Dory, doubtfully. “I know he’s all right in some ways, and\nhe has stopped drinking since he got the place at the bank. But–”",
        "“If we show we have confidence in him,” replied Adelaide, “I think it\nwill help him.”",
        "“Very well,” said Dory. “Besides, it isn’t easy to find people of the\nsort you’d be willing to have, who can leave home and come here.”",
        "Adelaide colored as she smiled. “Perhaps that was my reason, rather\nthan helping him,” she said.",
        "Dory flushed. “Oh, I didn’t mean to insinuate that!” he protested, and\nchecked himself from saying more. In their mood each would search the\nother’s every word for a hidden thrust, and would find it.",
        "The constraint between them, which thus definitely entered the stage of\ndeep cleavage where there had never been a joining, persisted until the\nparting. Since the wedding he had kissed her but once–on her arrival\nfrom Europe. Then, there was much bustle of greeting from others, and\nneither had had chance to be self-conscious. When they were at the\nstation for his departure, it so happened that no one had come with them.\nAs the porter warned them that the train was about to move, they shook\nhands and hesitated, blushing and conscious of themselves and of\nspectators, “Good-by,” stammered Dory, with a dash at her cheek.",
        "“Good-by,” she murmured, making her effort at the same instant.",
        "The result was a confusion of features and hat brims that threw them\ninto a panic, then into laughter, and so made the second attempt easy\nand successful. It was a real meeting of the lips. His arm went round\nher, her hand pressed tenderly on his shoulder, and he felt a trembling\nin her form, saw a sudden gleam of light leap into and from her eyes.\nAnd all in that flash the secret of his mistake in managing his love\naffair burst upon him.",
        "“Good-by, Dory–dear,” she was murmuring, a note in her voice like the\nshy answer of a hermit thrush to the call of her mate.",
        "“All aboard!” shouted the conductor, and the wheels began to move.",
        "“Good-by–good-by,” he stammered, his blood surging through his head.",
        "It came into her mind to say, “I care for you more than I knew.” But his\nfriend the conductor was thrusting him up the steps of the car. “I wish I\nhad said it,” thought she, watching the train disappear round the curve.\n“I’ll write it.”",
        "But she did not. When the time came to write, that idea somehow would not\nfit in with the other things she was setting down. “I think I do care for\nhim–as a friend,” she decided. “If he had only compelled me to find out\nthe state of my own mind! What a strange man! I don’t see how he can love\nme, for he knows me as I am. Perhaps he really doesn’t; sometimes I think\nhe couldn’t care for a woman as a woman wants to be cared for.” Then as\nhis face as she had last seen it rose before her, and her lips once more\ntingled, “Oh, yes, he does care! And without his love how wretched I’d\nbe! What a greedy I am–wanting his love and taking it, and giving\nnothing in return.” That last more than half-sincere, though she, like\nnot a few of her sisters in the “Woman’s Paradise,” otherwise known as\nthe United States of America, had been spoiled into greatly exaggerating\nthe value of her graciously condescending to let herself be loved.",
        "And she was lonely without him. If he could have come back at the end of\na week or a month, he would have been received with an ardor that would\nhave melted every real obstacle between them. Also, it would have\ndissipated the far more obstructive imaginary obstacles from their\ninfection with the latter-day vice of psychologizing about matters which\nlie in the realm of physiology, not of psychology. But he did not come;\nand absence, like bereavement, has its climax, after which the thing\nthat was begins to be as if it had not been.",
        "He was gone; and that impetuous parting caress of his had roused in her\nan impulse that would never again sleep, would pace its cage restlessly,\neager for the chance to burst forth. And he had roused it when he would\nnot be there to make its imperious clamor personal to himself.",
        "As Estelle was at her shop all day, and not a few of the evenings, Del\nbegan to see much of Henrietta Hastings. Grandfather Fuller was now dead\nand forgotten in the mausoleum into which he had put one-fifth of his\nfortune, to the great discontent of the heirs. Henrietta’s income had\nexpanded from four thousand a year to twenty; and she spent her days in\nthinking of and talking of the careers to which she could help her\nhusband if he would only shake off the lethargy which seized him the year\nafter his marriage to a Fuller heiress. But Hastings would not; he was\nhappy in his books and in his local repute for knowing everything there\nwas to be known. Month by month he grew fatter and lazier and slower of\nspeech. Henrietta pretended to be irritated against him, and the town had\nthe habit of saying that “If Hastings had some of his wife’s ’get up’ he\nwouldn’t be making her unhappy but would be winning a big name for\nhimself.” In fact, had Hastings tried to bestir himself at something\ndefinite in the way of action, Henrietta would have been really disturbed\ninstead of simply pretending to be. She had a good mind, a keen wit that\nhad become bitter with unlicensed indulgence; but she was as indolent and\npurposeless as her husband. All her energy went in talk about doing\nsomething, and every day she had a new scheme, with yesterday’s forgotten\nor disdained.",
        "Adelaide pretended to herself to regard Henrietta as an energetic and\nstimulating person, though she knew that Henrietta’s energy, like her\nown, like that of most women of the sheltered, servant-attended class,\nwas a mere blowing off of steam by an active but valveless engine of a\nmind. But this pretense enabled her to justify herself for long mornings\nand afternoons at the Country Club with Henrietta. They talked of\nactivity, of accomplishing this and that and the other; they read\nfitfully at serious books; they planned novels and plays; they separated\neach day with a comfortable feeling that they had been usefully employed.\nAnd each did learn much from the other; but, as each confirmed the other\nin the habitual mental vices of the women, and of an increasing number of\nthe men, of our quite comfortable classes, the net result of their\nintercourse was pitifully poor, the poorer for their fond delusions that\nthey were improving themselves. They laughed at the “culture craze\"\nwhich, raging westward, had seized upon all the women of Saint X with\nincomes, or with husbands or fathers to support them in idleness–the\ncraze for thinking, reading, and talking cloudily or muddily on cloudy or\nmuddy subjects. Henrietta and Adelaide jeered; yet they were themselves\nthe victims of another, and, if possible, more poisonous, bacillus of the\nsame sluggard family.",
        "One morning Adelaide, in graceful ease in her favorite nook in the small\nnorthwest portico of the club house, was reading a most imposingly bound\nand illustrated work on Italian architecture written by a smatterer for\nsmatterers. She did a great deal of reading in this direction because it\nwas also the direction of her talent, and so she could make herself think\nshe was getting ready to join in Dory’s work when he returned. She heard\nfootsteps just round the corner, and looked up. She and Ross Whitney were\nface to face.",
        "There was no chance for evasion. He, with heightened color, lifted his\nhat; she, with a nonchalance that made her proud of herself, smiled and\nstretched out her hand. “Hello, Ross,” said she, languidly friendly.\n“When did you come to town?” And she congratulated herself that her\nhair had gone up so well that morning and that her dress was one of her\nmost becoming–from Paris, from Paquin–a year old, it is true, but\nlater than the latest in Saint X and fashionable even for Sherry’s at\nlunch time.",
        "Ross, the expert, got himself together and made cover without any\nseeming of scramble; but his not quite easy eyes betrayed him to her.\n“About two hours ago,” replied he.",
        "“Is Theresa with you?” She gazed tranquilly at him as she fired this\ncenter shot. She admired the coolness with which he received it.",
        "“No; she’s up at her father’s place–on the lake shore,” he answered. He,\ntoo, was looking particularly well, fresh yet experienced, and in dress a\nmodel, with his serge of a strange, beautiful shade of blue, his red tie\nand socks, and his ruby-set cuff-links. “Mr. Howland is ill, and she’s\nnursing him. I’m taking a few days off–came down to try to sell father’s\nplace for him.”",
        "“You’re going to sell Point Helen?” said Adelaide, politely regretful.\n“Then I suppose we shan’t see your people here any more. Your mother’ll\nno doubt spend most of her time abroad, now that Janet is married there.”",
        "Ross did not answer immediately. He was looking into the distance, his\nexpression melancholy. His abstraction gave Adelaide a chance to verify\nthe impression she had got from a swift but femininely penetrating first\nglance. Yes, he did look older; no, not exactly older–sad, rather.\nEvidently he was unhappy, distinctly unhappy. And as handsome and as\ntasteful as ever–the band of his straw hat, the flower in his\nbuttonhole, his tie, his socks–all in harmony; no ostentation, just the\nunerring, quiet taste of a gentleman. What a satisfactory person to look\nat! To be sure, his character–However, character has nothing to do with\nthe eye-pleasures, and they are undeniably agreeable. Then there were his\nmanners, and his mind–such a man of the world! Of course he wasn’t for\none instant to be compared with Dory–who was? Still, it was a pity that\nDory had a prejudice against showing all that he really was, a pity he\nhad to be known to be appreciated–that is, appreciated by the “right\nsort” of people. Of course, the observant few could see him in his face,\nwhich was certainly distinguished–yes, far more distinguished than\nRoss’s, if not so regularly handsome.",
        "“I’ve been looking over the old place,” Ross was saying, “and I’ve\ndecided to ask father to keep it. Theresa doesn’t like it here; but I do,\nand I can’t bring myself to cut the last cords. As I wandered over the\nplace I found myself getting so sad and sentimental that I hurried away\nto escape a fit of the blues.”",
        "“We’re accustomed to that sort of talk,” said Adelaide with a mocking\nsmile in her delightful eyes. “People who used to live here and come back\non business occasionally always tell us how much more beautiful Saint X\nis than any other place on earth. But they take the first train for\nChicago or Cincinnati or anywhere at all.”",
        "“So you find it dull here?”",
        "“I?” Adelaide shrugged her charming shoulders slightly. “Not so very. My\nlife is here–the people, the things I’m used to. I’ve a sense of peace\nthat I don’t have anywhere else.” She gazed dreamily away. “And peace is\nthe greatest asset.”",
        "“The greatest asset,” repeated Ross absently. “You are to be envied.”",
        "“I think so,” assented she, a curious undertone of defiance in her\nvoice. She had a paniclike impulse to begin to talk of Dory; but, though\nshe cast about diligently, she could find no way of introducing him that\nwould not have seemed awkward–pointed and provincially prudish.",
        "“What are you reading?” he asked presently.",
        "She turned the book so that he could see the title. His eyes wandered\nfrom it to linger on her slender white fingers–on the one where a plain\nband of gold shone eloquently. It fascinated and angered him; and she saw\nit, and was delighted. Her voice had a note of triumph in it as she said,\nputting the book on the table beside her, “Foolish, isn’t it, to be\nreading how to build beautiful houses\"–she was going to say, “when one\nwill probably never build any house at all.” She bethought her that this\nmight sound like a sigh over Dory’s poverty and over the might-have-been.\nSo she ended, “when the weather is so deliciously lazy.”",
        "“I know the chap who wrote it,” said Ross, “Clever–really unusual\ntalent. But the fashionable women took him up, made him a toady and a\nsnob, like the rest of the men of their set. How that sort of thing eats\nout manhood and womanhood!”",
        "Just what Dory often said! “My husband says,” she answered, “that\nwhenever the world has got a fair start toward becoming civilized, along\nhave come wealth and luxury to smother and kill. It’s very interesting to\nread history from that standpoint, instead of taking the usual view–that\nluxury produces the arts and graces.”",
        "“Dory is a remarkable man,” said Ross with enthusiasm. “He’s amazingly\nmodest; but there are some men so big that they can’t hide, no matter how\nhard they try. He’s one of them.”",
        "Adelaide was in a glow, so happy did this sincere and just tribute make\nher, so relieved did she feel. She was talking to one of Dory’s friends\nand admirers, not with an old sweetheart of hers about whom her heart,\nperhaps, might be–well, a little sore, and from whom radiated a\nrespectful, and therefore subtle, suggestion that the past was very\nmuch the present for him. She hastened to expand upon Dory, upon his\nwork; and, as she talked of the university, she found she had a pride\nin it, and an interest, and a knowledge, too, which astonished her. And\nRoss listened, made appreciative comments. And so, on and on. When\nHenrietta came they were laughing and talking like the best of old\nfriends; and at Ross’s invitation the three lunched at the club and\nspent the afternoon together.",
        "“I think marriage has improved Ross,” said Henrietta, as she and Adelaide\nwere driving home together after tea–tea with Ross.",
        "“Theresa is a very sweet woman,” said Adelaide dutifully.",
        "“Oh, I don’t mean that–any more than you do,” replied Henrietta. “I mean\nmarriage has chastened him–the only way it ever improves anybody.”",
        "“No doubt he and Theresa are happy together,” said Adelaide, clinging to\nher pretense with a persistence that might have given her interesting and\nvaluable light upon herself had she noted it.",
        "“Happy?” Henrietta Hastings laughed. “Only stupid people are happy, my\ndear. Theresa may be happy, but not Ross. He’s far too intelligent. And\nTheresa isn’t capable of giving him even those moments of happiness that\nrepay the intelligent for their routine of the other sort of thing.”",
        "“Marriage doesn’t mean much in a man’s life,” said Adelaide. “He has his\nbusiness or profession. He is married only part of each day, and that the\nleast important part to him.”",
        "“Yes,” replied Henrietta, “marriage is for a man simply a peg in his\nshoe–in place or, as with Ross Whitney, out of place. One look at his\nface was enough to show me that he was limping and aching and groaning.”",
        "Adelaide found this pleasantry amusing far beyond its merits. “You can’t\ntell,” said she. “Theresa doesn’t seem the same to him that she does\nto–to us.”",
        "“Worse,” replied Henrietta, “worse. It’s fortunate they’re rich. If the\nbetter class of people hadn’t the money that enables them to put buffers\nround themselves, wife-beating wouldn’t be confined to the slums. Think\nof life in one of two small rooms with a Theresa Howland!”",
        "Adelaide had fallen, as far as could one of her generous and tolerant\ndisposition, into Henrietta’s most infectious habit of girding at\neveryone humorously–the favorite pastime of the idle who are profoundly\ndiscontented with themselves. By the time Mrs. Hastings left her at the\nlofty imported gates of Villa d’Orsay, they had done the subject of\nTheresa full justice, and Adelaide entered the house with that sense of\nself-contempt which cannot but come to any decent person after meting out\nuntempered justice to a fellow-mortal. This did not last, however; the\npleasure in the realization that Ross did not care for Theresa and did\ncare for herself was too keen. As the feminine test of feminine success\nis the impression a woman makes upon men, Adelaide would have been\nneither human nor woman had she not been pleased with Ross’s discreet and\nsincerely respectful, and by no means deliberate or designing disclosure.\nIt was not the proof of her power to charm the male that had made her\nindignant at herself. “How weak we women are!” she said to herself,\ntrying to assume a penitence she could not make herself feel. “We really\nought to be locked away in harems. No doubt Dory trusts me\nabsolutely–that’s because other women are no temptation to him–that is,\nI suppose they aren’t. If he were different, he’d be afraid I had his\nweakness–we all think everybody has at least a touch of our infirmities.\nOf course I can be trusted; I’ve sense enough not to have my head turned\nby what may have been a mere clever attempt to smooth over the past.\"\nThen she remembered Ross’s look at her hand, at her wedding ring, and\nHenrietta’s confirmation of her own diagnosis. “But why should thatinterest me,” she thought, impatient with herself for lingering where\nher ideal of self-respect forbade. “I don’t love Ross Whitney. He pleases\nme, as he pleases any woman he wishes to make an agreeable impression\nupon. And, naturally, I like to know that he really did care for me and\nis ashamed and repentant of the baseness that made him act as he did. But\nbeyond that, I care nothing about him–nothing. I may not care for Dory\nexactly as I should; but at least knowing him has made it impossible for\nme to go back to the Ross sort of man.”",
        "That seemed clear and satisfactory. But, strangely, her mind jumped to\nthe somewhat unexpected conclusion, “And I’ll not see him again.”",
        "She wrote Dory that night a long, long letter, the nearest to a love\nletter she had ever written him. She brought Ross in quite casually;\nyet–What is the mystery of the telltale penumbra round the written word?\nWhy was it that Dory, in far-away Vienna, with the memory of her strong\nand of the Villa d’Orsay dim, reading the letter for the first time,\nthought it the best he had ever got from her; and the next morning,\nreading it again, could think of nothing but Ross, and what Adelaide had\nreally thought about him deep down in that dark well of the heart where\nwe rarely let even our own eyes look intently?",
