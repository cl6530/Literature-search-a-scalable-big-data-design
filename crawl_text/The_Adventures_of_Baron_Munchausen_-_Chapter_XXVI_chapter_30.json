        "  A feast on live bulls and kava–The inhabitants admire the\n  European adventurers–The Emperor comes to meet the Baron, and\n  pays him great compliments–The inhabitants of the centre of\n  Africa descended from the people of the moon proved by an\n  inscription in Africa, and by the analogy of their language, which\n  is also the same with that of the ancient Scythians–The Baron is\n  declared sovereign of the interior of Africa on the decease of the\n  Emperor–He endeavours to abolish the custom of eating live bulls,\n  which excites much discontent–The advice of Hilaro Frosticos upon\n  the occasion–The Baron makes a speech to an Assembly of the\n  states, which only excites greater murmurs–He consults with\n  Hilaro Frosticos.",
        "Having passed over the nearest mountains we entered a delightful vale,\nwhere we perceived a multitude of persons at a feast of living bulls,\nwhose flesh they cut away with great knives, making a table of the\ncreature’s carcase, serenaded by the bellowing of the unfortunate\nanimal. Nothing seemed requisite to add to the barbarity of this feast\nbut kava, made as described in Cook’s voyages, and at the conclusion\nof the feast we perceived them brewing this liquor, which they drank\nwith the utmost avidity. From that moment, inspired with an idea of\nuniversal benevolence, I determined to abolish the custom of eating\nlive flesh and drinking of kava. But I knew that such a thing could\nnot be immediately effected, whatever in future time might be\nperformed.",
        "Having rested ourselves during a few days, we determined to set out\ntowards the principal city of the empire. The singularity of our\nappearance was spoken of all over the country as a phenomenon. The\nmultitude looked upon Sphinx, the bulls, the crickets, the balloons,\nand the whole company, as something more than terrestrial, but\nespecially the thunder of our fire-arms, which struck horror and\namazement into the whole nation.",
        "We at length arrived at the metropolis, situated on the banks of a\nnoble river, and the emperor, attended by all his court, came out in\ngrand procession to meet us. The emperor appeared mounted on a\ndromedary, royally caparisoned, with all his attendants on foot\nthrough respect for his Majesty. He was rather above the middle\nstature of that country, four feet three inches in height, with a\ncountenance, like all his countrymen, as white as snow! He was\npreceded by a band of most exquisite music, according to the fashion\nof the country, and his whole retinue halted within about fifty paces\nof our troop. We returned the salute by a discharge of musketry, and a\nflourish of our trumpets and martial music. I commanded our caravan to\nhalt, and dismounting, advanced uncovered, with only two attendants,\ntowards his Majesty. The emperor was equally polite, and descending\nfrom his dromedary, advanced to meet me. “I am happy,” said he, “to\nhave the honour to receive so illustrious a traveller, and assure you\nthat everything in my empire shall be at your disposal.”",
        "I thanked his Majesty for his politeness, and expressed how happy I\nwas to meet so polished and refined a people in the centre of Africa,\nand that I hoped to show myself and company grateful for his esteem,\nby introducing the arts and sciences of Europe among the people.",
        "I immediately perceived the true descent of this people, which does\nnot appear of terrestrial origin, but descended from some of the\ninhabitants of the moon, because the principal language spoken there,\nand in the centre of Africa, is very nearly the same. Their alphabet\nand method of writing are pretty much the same, and show the extreme\nantiquity of this people, and their exalted origin. I here give you a\nspecimen of their writing [Vide Otrckocsus de Orig. Hung. p. 46]:–\nStregnah, dna skoohtop.",
        "These characters I have submitted to the inspection of a celebrated\nantiquarian, and it will be proved to the satisfaction of every one,\nin his next volume, what an immediate intercourse there must have been\nbetween the inhabitants of the moon and the ancient Scythians, which\nScythians did not by any means inhabit a part of Russia, but the\ncentral part of Africa, as I can abundantly prove to my very learned\nand laborious friend. The above words, written in our characters, are\nSregnah dna skoohtop; that is, The Scythians are of heavenly origin.\nThe word Sregnah, which signifies Scythians, is compounded of\nsreg or sre, whence our present English word sire, or sir: and\nnah, or gnah, knowledge, because the Scythians united the\nessentials of nobility and learning together: dna signifies heaven,\nor belonging to the moon, from duna, who was anciently worshipped as\ngoddess of that luminary. And skooh-top signifies the origin or\nbeginning of anything, from skoo, the name used in the moon for a\npoint in geometry, and top or htop, vegetation. These words are\ninscribed at this day upon a pyramid in the centre of Africa, nearly\nat the source of the river Niger; and if any one refuses his assent,\nhe may go there to be convinced.",
        "The emperor conducted me to his court amidst the admiration of his\ncourtiers, and paid us every possible politeness that African\nmagnificence could bestow. He never presumed to proceed on any\nexpedition without consulting us, and looking upon us as a species of\nsuperior beings, paid the greatest respect to our opinions. He\nfrequently asked me about the states of Europe, and the kingdom of\nGreat Britain, and appeared lost in admiration at the account I gave\nhim of our shipping, and the immensity of the ocean. We taught him to\nregulate the government nearly on the same plan with the British\nconstitution, and to institute a parliament and degrees of nobility.\nHis majesty was the last of his royal line, and on his decease, with\nthe unanimous consent of the people, made me heir to the whole empire.\nThe nobility and chiefs of the country immediately waited upon me with\npetitions, entreating me to accept the government. I consulted with my\nnoble friends, Gog and Magog, &c., and after much consultation it was\nagreed that I should accept the government, not as actual and\nindependent monarch of the place, but as viceroy to his Majesty of\nEngland.",
        "I now thought it high time to do away the custom of eating of live\nflesh and drinking of kava, and for that purpose used every persuasive\nmethod to wean the majority of the people from it. This, to my\nastonishment, was not taken in good part by the nation, and they\nlooked with jealousy at those strangers who wanted to make innovations\namong them.",
        "Nevertheless, I felt much concern to think that my fellow-creatures\ncould be capable of such barbarity. I did everything that a heart\nfraught with universal benevolence and good will to all mankind could\nbe capable of desiring. I first tried every method of persuasion and\nincitement. I did not harshly reprove them, but I invited frequently\nwhole thousands to dine, after the fashion of Europe, upon roasted\nmeat. Alas, ’twas all in vain! my goodness nearly excited a sedition.\nThey murmured among themselves, spoke of my intentions, my wild and\nambitious views, as if I, O heaven! could have had any personal\ninterested motive in making them live like men, rather than like\ncrocodiles and tigers. In fine, perceiving that gentleness could be of\nno avail, well knowing that when complaisance can effect nothing from\nsome spirits, compulsion excites respect and veneration, I prohibited,\nunder the pain of the severest penalties, the drinking of kava, or\neating of live flesh, for the space of nine days, within the districts\nof Angalinar and Paphagalna.",
        "But this created such an universal abhorrence and detestation of my\ngovernment, that my ministers, and even myself, were universally\npasquinadoed; lampoons, satires, ridicule, and insult, were showered\nupon the name of Munchausen wherever it was mentioned; and in fine,\nthere never was a government so much detested, or with such little\nreason.",
        "In this dilemma I had recourse to the advice of my noble friend Hilaro\nFrosticos. In his good sense I now expected some resource, for the\nrest of the council, who had advised me to the former method, had\ngiven but a poor specimen of their abilities and discernment, or I\nshould have succeeded more happily. In short, he addressed himself to\nme and to the council as follows:–",
        "“It is in vain, most noble Munchausen, that your Excellency endeavours\nto compel or force these people to a life to which they have never\nbeen accustomed. In vain do you tell them that apple-pies, pudding,\nroast beef, minced pies, or tarts, are delicious, that sugar is sweet,\nthat wine is exquisite. Alas! they cannot, they will not comprehend\nwhat deliciousness is, what sweetness, or what the flavour of the\ngrape. And even if they were convinced of the superior excellence of\nyour way of life, never, never would they be persuaded; and that if\nfor no other reason, but because force or persuasion is employed to\ninduce them to it. Abandon that idea for the present, and let us try\nanother method. My opinion, therefore, is, that we should at once\ncease all endeavours to compel or persuade them. But let us, if\npossible, procure a quantity of fudge from England, and carelessly\nscatter it over all the country; and from this disposal of matters I\npresume–nay, I have a moral certainty, that we shall reclaim this\npeople from horror and barbarity.”",
        "Had this been proposed at any other time, it would have been violently\nopposed in the council; but now, when every other attempt had failed,\nwhen there seemed no other resource, the majority willingly submitted\nto they knew not what, for they absolutely had no idea of the manner,\nthe possibilities of success, or how they could bring matters to bear.\nHowever, ’twas a scheme, and as such they submitted. For my part, I\nlistened with ecstasy to the words of Hilaro Frosticos, for I knew\nthat he had a most singular knowledge of human kind, and could humour\nand persuade them on to their own happiness and universal good.\nTherefore, according to the advice of Hilaro, I despatched a balloon\nwith four men over the desert to the Cape of Good Hope, with letters\nto be forwarded to England, requiring, without delay, a few cargoes of\nfudge.",
        "The people had all this time remained in a general state of ferment\nand murmur. Everything that rancour, low wit, and deplorable ignorance\ncould conceive to asperse my government, was put in execution. The\nmost worthy, even the most beneficent actions, everything that was\namiable, were perverted into opposition.",
        "The heart of Munchausen was not made of such impenetrable stuff as to\nbe insensible to the hatred of even the most worthless wretch in the\nwhole kingdom; and once, at a general assembly of the states, filled\nwith an idea of such continued ingratitude, I spoke as pathetic as\npossible, not, methought, beneath my dignity, to make them feel for\nme: that the universal good and happiness of the people were all I\nwished or desired; that if my actions had been mistaken, or improper\nsurmises formed, still I had no wish, no desire, but the public\nwelfare, &c. &c. &c.",
        "Hilaro Frosticos was all this time much disturbed; he looked sternly\nat me–he frowned, but I was so engrossed with the warmth of my heart,\nmy intentions, that I understood him not: in a minute I saw nothing\nbut as if through a cloud (such is the force of amiable sensibility)–\nlords, ladies, chiefs–the whole assembly seemed to swim before my\nsight. The more I thought on my good intentions, the lampoons which so\nmuch affected my delicacy, good nature, tenderness–I forgot myself–I\nspoke rapid, violent–beneficence–fire–tenderness–alas! I melted\ninto tears!",
        "“Pish! pish!” said Hilaro Frosticos.",
        "Now, indeed, was my government lampooned, satirised, carribonadoed,\nbepickled, and bedevilled. One day, with my arm full of lampoons, I\nstarted up as Hilaro entered the room, the tears in my eyes: “Look,\nlook here, Hilaro!–how can I bear all this? It is impossible to\nplease them; I will leave the government–I cannot bear it! See what\npitiful anecdotes–what surmises: I will make my people feel for me–I\nwill leave the government!”",
        "“Pshaw!” says Hilaro. At that simple mono-syllable I found myself\nchanged as if by magic! for I ever looked on Hilaro as a person so\nexperienced–such fortitude, such good sense. “There are three sails,\nunder the convoy of a frigate,” added Hilaro, “just arrived at the\nCape, after a fortunate passage, laden with the fudge that we\ndemanded. No time is to be lost; let it be immediately conducted\nhither, and distributed through the principal granaries of the\nempire.”",
