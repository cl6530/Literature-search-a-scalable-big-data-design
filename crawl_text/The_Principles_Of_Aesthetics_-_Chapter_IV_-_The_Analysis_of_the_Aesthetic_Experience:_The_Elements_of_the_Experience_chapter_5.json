        "Thus far we have sought to define art, to form a concrete idea of the\nexperience of art, and to place it in its relations to other facts.\nWe shall now pass from synthetic definition to psychological analysis.\nWe want to pick out the elements of mind entering into the experience\nof art and exhibit their characteristic relations. In the present\nchapter we shall concern ourselves chiefly with the elements, leaving\nthe study of most of the problems of structure to the following chapter.",
        "Every experience of art  [Footnote: Throughout this discussion, I use\n“experience of art,” “aesthetic experience,” and “beauty” with the same\nmeaning.] contains, in the first place, the sensations which are the\nmedia of expression. In a painting, for example, there are colors; in\na piece of music, tones; in a poem, word-sounds. To this material,\nsecondly, are attached vague feelings. It is characteristic of aesthetic\nexpressions, as we have observed, that their media, quite apart from\nanything that they may mean or represent, are expressive of moods–the\ncolors of a painting have a stimmung, so have tones and words,\nwhen rhythmically composed. The simplest aesthetic experiences, like\nthe beauty of single musical tones or colors, are of no greater\ncomplexity; yet almost all works of art contain further elements; for\nas a rule the sensations do not exist for their own sakes alone, but\npossess a function, to represent things. The colors of a landscape\npainting are not only interesting to us as beautiful colors, but as\nsymbols of a landscape; the words of a ballad charm and stimulate us\nnot only through their music, but because of actions or events which\nthey bring before the mind. This involves, psychologically speaking,\nthat certain ideas–of trees and clouds in the painting, of men and\ntheir deeds in the poem–are associated to the sense elements and\nconstitute their meaning. Such ideas or meanings are the third class\nof elements in the aesthetic experience. But these ideas, in their turn,\nalso arouse emotions, only not of the indefinite sort which belong to\nthe sense elements, but definite, like the emotions aroused by things\nand events in real life. For example, Rembrandt’s “Man with the Gold\nHelmet” will not only move us in a vague way through the character and\nrhythm of its lines and colors, but will, in addition, stimulate\nsentiments of respect and veneration, similar to those that we should\nfeel if the old warrior were himself before us. In such definite\nfeelings we have, then, a fourth class of mental elements. A fifth\nclass will make our list complete. It consists of images from the\nvarious sense departments–sight, hearing, taste, smell, temperature,\nmovement–which arise in connection with the ideas or meanings, making\nthem concrete and full. For example, some of the colors in a landscape\npainting will not only give us the idea that there is sunlight there,\nbut will also arouse faint images of warmth, which will make the idea\nmore vivid; other colors, representing the clouds, will produce faint\nsensations of softness; still others, representing flowers, may produce\nfaint odors.",
        "Let us study sensation as an element in beauty, first. Sensation is\nthe door through which we enter into the experience of beauty; and,\nagain, it is the foundation upon which the whole structure rests.\nWithout feeling for the values of sensation, men may be sympathetic\nand intelligent, but they cannot be lovers of the beautiful. They may,\nfor example, appreciate the profound or interesting ideas in poetry,\nbut unless they can connect them with the rhythm-values of the sounds\nof the words, they have only an intellectual or emotional, not an\naesthetic experience.",
        "Yet, despite the omnipresence and supreme worth of sensation in beauty,\nnot all kinds are equally fit for entrance into the experience. From\nthe time of Plato, who writes of “fair sights and sounds” only, vision\nand hearing have been recognized as the preeminently aesthetic senses.\nThese senses provide the basis for all the arts–music and poetry are\narts of sound; painting, sculpture, and architecture are arts of vision.\nAnd there are good reasons for their special fitness. Most cogent of\nall is the fact that vision and hearing are the natural media of\nexpression; sounds, be they words or musical tones, convey thoughts\nand feelings; so do visual sensations–the facial expression or gesture\nseen communicates the inner life of the speaker; and even abstract\ncolors and space-forms, like red and the circle, have independent\nfeeling-tones. A taste or a temperature sensation may be pleasant or\nunpleasant, but has no meaning, either by itself, as a color or a tone\nhas, or through association, as a word has. It has no connection with\nthe life of feeling or of thought. Its chief significance is\npractical–sweet invites to eating, cold impels to the seeking of a\nwarm shelter, touch is a preliminary to grasping. All the so-called\nlower senses are bound up with instincts and actions. Of course sights\nand sounds have also a significance for instinct–the color and form\nand voice of the individual of the opposite sex, for example. But,\nbefore acting on the prompting of instinct, the lover may pause and\nenjoy the appealing color and form; he may connect his feelings with\nthem and hold on to and delight in the resulting experience–an\nemotional appreciation of the object may intervene between the stimulus\nand the appropriate action, and even supplant it. In this way, vision\nand hearing may free themselves from the merely practical and become\nautonomous embodiments of feeling. The distance between the seen or\nheard object and the body is important. The objects of touch and taste,\non the other hand, have to be brought into contact with the body; the\npractical reaction then follows; there is no time during which it may\nbe suspended.",
        "Important also, especially for the beauty of art, is our greater power\nto control sensations of vision and hearing. Only colors and sounds\ncan be woven into complex and stable wholes. Tastes and odors, when\nproduced simultaneously or in succession, do not keep their distinctness\nas colors and sounds do, but blur and interfere with each other. No\none, however ingenious, could construct a symphony of odors or a picture\nof tastes. Nevertheless, the possibility of controlling colors and\nsounds and of creating stable and public objects out of them, is only\na secondary reason for their aesthetic fitness. Even if one could\nconstruct instruments for the orderly production of tastes and\nodors–and simple instruments of this kind have been devised–one could\nnot make works of art out of them; for a succession of such sensations\nwould express nothing; they would still be utterly without meaning.\nThe fundamental reason for the superiority of sights and sounds is\ntheir expressiveness, their connection with the life of feeling and\nthought. They take root in the total self; whereas the other elements\nremain, for the most part, on the surface.",
        "Under favorable conditions, however, all sensations may enter into the\nsthetic experience. Despite the close connection between the lower\nsenses and the impulses serving practical life, there is a certain\ndisinterestedness in all pleasant sensations. Fine wines and perfumes\noffer tastes and odors which are sought and enjoyed apart from the\nsatisfaction of hunger; in dancing, movement sensations are enjoyed\nfor their own sake; in the bath, heat and cold. But, as we have seen,\nit is not sufficient for a sensation to be free from practical ends\nin order to become aesthetic; it must be connected with the larger\nbackground of feeling; it must be expressive. Now, under certain\ncircumstances and in particular cases, this may occur, even in the\ninstance of the lower senses. The perfume of flowers, of roses and of\nviolets, has a strong emotional appeal; it is their “soul” as the poets\nsay. The odor of incense in a cathedral may be an important element\nin devotion, fusing with the music and the architecture. Or recall the\nodor of wet earth and reviving vegetation during a walk in the woods\non a spring morning. Even sensations of taste may become aesthetic.\nAn oft-cited example is the taste of wine on a Rhine steamer. Guyau,\nthe French poet-philosopher, mentions the taste of milk after a hard\nclimb in the Pyrenees.  [Footnote: Les Problemes de l’esthetique\ncontemporaine, 8me edition, p. 63.] A drink of water from a clear\nspring would serve equally well as an example familiar to all. The\nwarmth of a fire, of sunlight, of a cozy room, or the cold of a star-lit\nwinter night have an emotional significance almost, if not quite, equal\nto that of the visual sensations from these objects. Touch seems to\nbe irretrievably bound up with grasping and using, but the touch of\na well-loved person may be a free and glowing experience, sharing with\nsight in beauty. The movement sensations during a run in the open air\nor in dancing are not only free from all practical purpose, but are\nelements in the total animation. And other examples will come to the\nmind of every reader.  [Footnote: Compare Volkelt: System der\nAesthetik, Bd. I, Zweites Capitel, S. 92.]",
        "As our illustrations show, the lower senses enter into the beauty of\nnature only; they do not enter into the beauty of art. Their beauty\nis therefore vague and accidental. It usually depends, moreover, upon\nsome support from vision, with the beauty of which it fuses. Apart\nfrom the picturesque surroundings seen, the mountain milk and the Rhine\nwine would lose much of their beauty; the warmth of sunlight or of\nfire, without the brightness of these objects, the odor of flowers\nwithout their form and color, would be of small aesthetic worth. Through\nconnection with vision the lower senses acquire something of its\npermanence and independence. People differ greatly in their capacity\nto render the lower senses aesthetic; it is essentially a matter of\nrefinement, of power to free them from their natural root in the\npractical and instinctive, and lift them into the higher region of\nsentiment. But every kind of sensation, however low, may become\nbeautiful; this is not to degrade beauty, but to ennoble sensation.",
        "From a psychological standpoint, sensation is the datum of the aesthetic\nexperience, the first thing there, while its power to express depends\nupon a further process which links it up with thoughts and feelings.\nWe must inquire, therefore, how this linkage takes place–how, for\nexample, it comes about that the colors of a painting are something\nmore than mere colors, being, in addition, embodiments of trees and\nsky and foliage, and of liveliness and gayety and other feelings\nappropriate to a spring landscape. Let us consider the linkage with\nfeeling first.",
        "There are two characteristics of aesthetic feeling in its relation to\nsensations and ideas which must be taken into account in any\nexplanation; its objectification in them and the universality of this\nconnection. Expression is embodiment. We find gayety in the colors of\nthe painting, joy in the musical tones, happiness in the pictured face,\ntenderness in the sculptured pose. We hear the feeling in the sounds\nand see it in the lines and colors. The happiness seems to belong to\nthe face, the joy to the tones, in the same simple and direct fashion\nas the shape of the one or the pitch of the others. The feelings have\nbecome true attributes. It is only by analysis that we pick them out,\nseparate them from the other elements of idea or sensation in the\nwhole, and then, for the purpose of scientific explanation, inquire\nhow they came to be connected. And this connection is not one that\ndepends upon the accidents of personal experience. It is not, for\nexample, like the emotional significance that the sound of the voice\nof the loved one has for the lover, which even he may some day cease\nto feel, and which other men do not feel at all. It is rather typified\nby the emotional value of a melody, which, through psychological\nprocesses common to all men, becomes a universal language of feeling.\nThe work of art is a communicable, not a private expression.",
        "As we have observed, the elements of feeling in the aesthetic experience\nare of two broad kinds–either vague, when directly linked with the\nsensuous medium, or else definite, when this linkage is mediated by\nideas through which the medium is given content and meaning. The former\nkind, which I shall consider first, comprises all cases of the emotional\nexpressiveness of the medium itself,–of tones and word-sounds and\ntheir rhythms and patterns, of colors and lines and space-forms and\ntheir designs. The detailed study of this expressiveness I shall leave\nto the chapters on the arts; here I wish merely to indicate the kind\nof psychological process involved.",
        "In many cases the psychological principle of association operates. The\ntender expressiveness of certain curved lines, like those of the Greek\namphora, for example, is due, partially at least, to association with\nlines of the human body, with which normally this feeling is associated.\nThe associated object, together with its feeling tone, are sufficiently\ncommon to the experience of all men to account for the universality\nof the emotion, and the isolation of the stimulus–abstract line–from\nits usual context of color and bulk accounts for the vagueness.\nSometimes, on the other hand, expressiveness seems to be due to a\ndirect psychological relation between the sense-stimulus and the\nemotion. This is almost certainly the case with rhythms, and, as I\nshall argue in the chapters on painting and music, is at least partially\ntrue of colors and tones. The expressiveness is at once too immediate\nand too universal to depend upon association with definite things and\nevents, or personal, emotional crises. A rhythm, for example, may be\nexciting the first time it is heard; one does not have to wait to hear\nit at a battle-charge; a melody may be sad even when one has never\nheard it sung by chance at parting. Of course the fact that associations\nare not remembered is no proof that they do not operate; but it is\ndifficult to conceive of any which could operate in these cases. For\nthis reason, I think, we must suppose that certain sense-stimuli and\ncombinations of stimuli not only produce in the sensory areas of the\nbrain the appropriate sensations, but that their effects are prolonged,\noverflowing into the motor channels and there causing a total reaction\nof the organism, the conscious aspect of which is a vague feeling. The\norganic resonance is too slight and diffuse to produce a true emotion;\nhence only a mood results.",
        "In all the representative arts the vague expressiveness of the medium\nis reinforced through emotions aroused by ideas which interpret\nsensation as an element of a thing. The green in the painting is not\nonly green, but green of the sea; the red is not only red, but red of\nthe sky; the curved line is not a mere curve, it is the outline of a\nwave. The totality of colors and lines is not a mere color and line\ncomposition, but a marine landscape. The feeling tones of the elements\nof this complex and of the complex itself are not only those of the\ncolors and lines as such, but of the interpretative ideas as well;\nwhich in turn are the same as those of the corresponding real things.\nThe psychological process is here simple enough. The feeling tone of\nthe sea is carried by the idea of the sea, which now fuses with the\ngreen color and wavy lines of the painting.",
        "But in order fully to explain the phenomena of aesthetic expression,\nit is not sufficient to show how the connection between feeling and\nsensation and idea takes place; it is necessary, in addition, to explain\nthe nature of this connection. The feeling is not experienced by us\nas what it is–our reaction to the sensations or represented\nobjects–but rather as an objective quality of them. The sounds are\nsad, the curve tender, the sea placid and reposeful. Why is this?",
        "The explanation is, I think, as follows. Despite their usual\nsubjectivity, feelings tend to be located in the objective world\nwhenever they are in conflict with or not directly rooted in the\npersonal life or character of the individual. In listening to music,\nfor example, feelings of despair and terror may be aroused in me who\nam perhaps secure and happy; and even if the feelings are joyous, they\nare not occasioned by any piece of personal good fortune–my situation\nin life is the same now as before. Hence, finding no lodgment in the\nego, and having to exist somewhere, they seek a domicile in the sounds\nevoking them. And, in general, works of art arouse but offer no personal\noccasions for feeling, and therefore absorb it into themselves.",
        "The process of objectification may, however, go further. It often\nhappens in the aesthetic experience that feelings are not objectified\nalone, but carry with them the idea of the self–I come to feel\nmyself as joyous or despairing in the sounds. The extent to which the\nidea of the self thus follows the objectified feelings depends largely\nupon the amount of their reverberation throughout the organism. When\nthis is small, and the feelings are vague and tenuous, as in color\nappreciation, there is little or no definite projection of the idea\nof the self; when, on the other hand, it is large and the emotions are\nstrong, as oftentimes in music, where breathing, circulation, hand and\nfoot are affected, then I myself seem to be there,–striving, pursuing,\nstruggling, in the sounds. I am where my body is. The projection of\nthe idea of the self is facilitated for the same reason when the body\nis actually employed in the creation of the work of art, as in singing\nand acting. It also occurs more readily when the life expressed in the\nwork of art is akin to the spectator’s. Thus, an emotional and\nsuggestible woman, in watching a fine performance of “Magda,” inevitably\nputs herself in the place of the heroine if she has herself lived\nthrough a similar experience. But when the life expressed is strikingly\nforeign to our own, the projection of the idea of self is more\ndifficult; the duality between subject and object tends to remain.",
        "These phenomena have excited special attention when, as in painting\nand sculpture and the drama, a human being is represented. Suppose,\nfor example, I see a statue of a runner ready to start. I not only see\nthe form and color of the marble and recognize them as a man’s; I also\nfeel emotions of excitement, tension, and expectation such as I should\nmyself feel were I too posed and waiting to run a race. And these\nemotions I experience as the man’s, and as his, not in a vague way,\nbut as definitely present in his sculptured form, even in particular\nparts of it,–in the swelling chest and tightened limbs. Or consider\nanother case. Suppose I see Franz Hals’ “Laughing Cavalier.” I feel\njollity in the face, as the cavalier’s. Yet in both cases I may feel\nthe emotions as also my own–as if I too were about to run or were\nlaughing. And the projection of the idea of the self will occur most\nreadily if I am myself a runner or a jolly person. In both instances,\nmoreover, the process will be mediated by impulses to movements that\nare the normal accompaniments of the emotions in question. If I observe\nmyself carefully, I may find that my own chest is tending to swell and\nmy own limbs to tighten, in imitation of the runner’s, or my own pupils\nto dilate and the muscles of my face to wrinkle and to part, in\nimitation of the Dutchman’s. And these movement-impulses I objectify.\nI not only see jollity in the face, but laughter as well; in the statue,\nnot only excitement, but running. And again–where my body is, there\nam I; so I am jolly with the cavalier and excited with the runner. The\npsychology of this process is simple enough. In my experience there\nis a plain connection between the sight of a movement and sensations\nattendant upon movement, and further, a connection between some of\nthese movements, namely, the expressive movements, and the emotions\nwhich they express. In accordance with the law of association by\ncontiguity, whenever any one of several mental elements usually\nconnected together is present in the mind, the others tend to arise\nalso. So here. Seeing the semblance of tight muscles and a smiling\nface, I feel the emotions which have these visual associates, experience\nthe correlated movement-sensations, project them all into the object\nwhich initiated the process.",
        "In recent years, a great deal has been made of these movement-sensations\nin explaining aesthetic feeling.  [Footnote: See the discussions in Lee\nand Thompson: Beauty and Ugliness.] Yet in the case of all people who\nare not strongly of the motor type, people in whose mental make-up\nmovement plays a minor part in comparison with vision and other\nsensations, they play a secondary role, or even hardly any role at\nall. Most spectators, indeed, instead of actually making slight\nmovements imitative of the movements seen or represented, and\nexperiencing the corresponding sensations, make no movements at all\nand simply experience movement images; this substitution of image for\nmovement probably occurs in the minds of all except the most imitative.\nMost people, even of the motor type, do not smile when they see the\n“Laughing Cavalier” or start to run when they see the statue of the\nrunner; careful observation of themselves would disclose only faint\nmovement images which seem to play about their lips or limbs–mere\nimages of movement have supplanted movements. And many visualists would\nnot find any images at all. However, although the mistake has been\ncommitted by some investigators of supposing that everybody experiences\nmovement because they themselves, being of the motor type, do, it\ncannot be denied, I think, that such people attain to a vividness of\naesthetic living not reached by others. They appreciate beauty with\ntheir bodies as well as with their souls. And in their case too, as\nhas been shown, aesthetic appreciation is more strongly histrionic–they\nnot only put themselves into the work of art, but the idea of themselves\nas well.",
        "Following the German school of einfuehlung, I have insisted throughout\nthis discussion on the importance of feeling in the aesthetic\nexperience; yet I do not think the voice of those people can be\nneglected who claim that their experience with works of art is of\nslight or no emotional intensity. There are people who would report\nthat they feel no jollity when they see the “Laughing Cavalier,” or\nanguish when they read the Ugolino Canto in the Inferno; yet such\npeople often have a highly developed aesthetic taste. How can this\ndifference be accounted for?",
        "Starting with the emotional appreciation of art as primary, we can\naccount for it in this wise. It is a familiar phenomenon in the mental\nlife for a concept or idea of an emotional experience to take the place\nof that experience. What man has not rejoiced when the simple and cold\njudgment, “I suffered then,” has come to supplant a recurring torment?\nOr who that has lived constantly with a sick person has not observed\nhow, looking on the face of pain, inevitably the mere comment, “he is\nin distress,” comes to supplant the liveliest sympathetic thrill? There\nare many reasons for this. The idea or judgment is a less taxing thing\nthan an emotion, and so is substituted for it in the mind, which\neverywhere seeks economy of effort. The idea is also more efficient\nfrom a practical point of view, because it leads directly to action\nand does not divert and waste energy in diffused and useless movements.\nThe physician simply recognizes the states of mind of his patients,\nhe does not sympathize with them. Finally our own reactions to an\nobjectified emotion may interfere with the emotion. If, for example,\nwe see an angry man, our own fear of him may entirely supplant our\nsympathetic feeling of his anger. In general, in our dealings with our\nfellow men, we are too busy with our attitudes and plans with reference\nto them, and too much concerned with economizing our emotional energy,\nto get a sympathetic intuition of their inner life, and so are content\nwith an intellectual recognition of it. Now this habit of substituting\nthe more rapid and economical process of judgment for the longer and\nmore taxing one of sympathy, is carried over into the world of art.",
        "Nevertheless, the world of art is a region especially fitted for\neinfuehlung. For there the need for quick action, which in life\ntends to syncopate emotion, does not exist. The characteristic attitude\nof art is leisurely absorption in an object, giving time for all the\npossibilities of feeling or other experience to develop. Moreover, in\nart there is not the same saving need for the substitution of idea for\nfeeling as in real life. For in art, feeling is not so strong as in\nlife; even when the artist expresses his own personal experience, he\nlightens its emotional burden through expression, and we, when we make\nhis experience ours, find a similar relief. The emotion is genuine,\nonly weakened in intensity. In other cases, where the artist constructs\na world of fictitious characters and events, our knowledge that they\nare not real suffices to diminish the intensity of the emotions aroused.\nFor emotions have the practical function of inciting to action, and\nwhen action is impossible, as in the purely ideal world of the artist,\nthey cannot keep their natural intensity. We cannot feel so strongly\nover the mere idea of an event as over a real event. Were it otherwise,\nwho could stand the strain of Hamlet or Othello?",
        "Throughout this discussion of the elements of the experience of art,\nI have used the terms emotion and feeling with an inclusive meaning,\nto cover impulses as well as feelings in the narrower sense. For in\nthe aesthetic experience, there are impulses–impulses to move when\naction is represented in picture and statue, impulses to act, as when,\nin watching a play, we put ourselves in the place of the persons. But\nsuch impulses are always checked through the realization that they\ncome from sources unrelated to our purposes, and fail to get the\nreenforcement or consent of the total self necessary to action. In\nreading or singing the “Marseillaise,” to cite an example from poetry,\nI experience all kinds of impulses–to shoulder a musket, to march,\nto kill–but no one of them is carried out. Now an inhibited impulse\nis scarcely distinguishable from an emotion. With few exceptions, the\nimpulses in art do not issue in resolves, decisions, determinations\nto act; or, if they do, the determinations refer to acts to be executed\nin the future, in an experience distinct and remote from the\nsthetic–the “Marseillaise” has doubtless produced such resolutions\nin the minds of Frenchmen; and there is much art that is productive\nin that way, providing the “birth in beauty” of which Plato wrote.\n [Footnote: In the Symposium.] In art, impulses result in immediate\naction only when action is itself the medium of expression, as in the\ndance, where impulses to movement pass over into motion. Of course such\nactions still remain aesthetic since they serve no practical end and are\nvalued for themselves.",
        "If the question were raised, which is more fundamental in the aesthetic\nexperience, idea or emotion? the answer would have to be, emotion. For\nthere exists at least one great art where no explicit ideas are present,\nmusic, whereas art without emotion does not exist. Take away the\nemotional content from expression and you get either a mere play of\nsensations, like fireworks, or else pseudo-science, like the modern\nnaturalistic play. However, the supreme importance of the idea in art\ncannot be denied. Every complex work of art, save music, is an\nexpression of ideas as well as of feelings, and even in music there\nexists the tendency for feeling to seek definition in ideas–do we not\nsay a musical idea? And do we not find the masters of so abstract an\nart as ornament employing their materials to represent symbolic\nconceptions? I wish to call the attention of the reader to certain\nvery general considerations touching the nature and function of ideas\nin the aesthetic experience, leaving the study of the concrete problems\nto the more special chapters.",
        "First, the relation of the idea to the sense medium of the expression.\nHere, I think, we find something comparable to the process of\neinfuehlung. For in art, ideas, like feelings, are objectified\nin sensation. Only sensations are given; out of the mind come ideas\nthrough which the former are interpreted and made into the semblance\nof things. Consider, for example, Rembrandt’s “Night-Watch.” A festal\nmood is there in the golds and reds, and gloom in the blacks; but there\nalso are the men and drums and arms. If we wished to push the analogy\nwith einfuehlung, we might coin a corresponding term–einmeinung,\n“inmeaning.” In all the representative arts, this is a process of equal\nimportance with infeeling; for the artist strives just as much to\nrealize his ideas of objects in the sense material of his art as to put\nhis moods there.",
        "When, moreover, we consider that the expression of the more complex\nand definite emotions is dependent upon the expression of ideas of\nnature and human life, we see that the process is really a single one.\nFeeling is a function of ideas; if, then, we demand sincerity in the\none, we must equally demand conviction in the other. The poet could\nnot convey to us his pleasure at the sight of nature or his awe of\ndeath unless he could somehow bring us into their presence. The painter\ncould not express the moods of sunlight or of shadow until he had\ninvented a technique for their representation. Clear and confident\nseeing is a condition of feeling. Hence every advance in the imitation\nof nature is an advance in the power of expression. The demand for\nfidelity of representation, for “truth to nature,” so insistently made\nby the common man in his criticism of art, is justified even from the\npoint of view of expressionism.",
        "Yet this fidelity of representation does not involve exact reproduction\nof nature. The limitations of the media of the arts definitely exclude\nthis. No painter can reproduce on a canvas the infinite detail of any\nobject or exactly imitate its colors and lines. In the single matter\nof brightness, for example, his medium is hopelessly inadequate; even\nthe light of the moon is beyond his power, not to speak of the light\nof the sun; he has to substitute a relative for an absolute scale of\nvalues. The sculptor cannot reproduce the color or hair of the human\nbody. However, this failure exactly to imitate nature does not prevent\nthe artist from suggesting to us ideas of the objects in which he is\ninterested. If the outline of the marble be that of a man, we get the\nidea of a man; if the color and shape be that of a tree, we get the\nidea of a tree. Our acceptance of these ideas is, of course, only\npartial; for we are equally susceptible to the negative suggestions\nof the whiteness of the marble and the smallness of the outline of the\ntree. Every work of art represents a sort of compromise between reality\nand unreality, belief and disbelief.",
        "Nevertheless, despite this compromise, the purpose of art is\nuncompromisingly attained. For art does not seek to give us nature\nover again, but to express its feeling tones, and these are conveyed\nwhen we get an idea of the corresponding object, even if that idea is\ninadequate from a strictly scientific point of view. We do not react\nemotionally to the infinite detail of any object, but only to its\npresence as a whole and to certain salient features. The artist succeeds\nwhen he constructs a humanized image of the object–one which arouses\nand becomes a center for feeling. This image, when made of a few\nelements, may be far more telling than a much more accurate copy; for\nthere is no diffusion of interest to irrelevant aspects. How effective\na medium for expression are the few and simple lines of Beardsley’s\ndraftsmanship! The amount of detail necessary to convey an emotionally\neffective idea is relative to the technique of the different arts and\nvaries also with the suggestibility and discrimination of the observer.\nHere no a priori principles can be laid down for what only the\nexperimental practice of the artist can determine.",
        "Moreover, the negative suggestions of a work of art, although they are\neffective in preventing entire belief in the reality of the idea\nexpressed, do not hinder the communication and appreciation of the\nattached feelings. Just so long as the belief attitude is not wholly\nextinguished, this is the case; and the skillful artist takes care of\nthat. Of course, an attitude of self-surrender, of willingness to\naccept suggestions, has to be present and we cooperate with the artist\nin creating it. Aesthetic belief implies sufficient abandon that we\nmay react emotionally to a suggestion, but not enough that we may react\npractically. We let the idea tell upon our feelings; we do not let it\nincite us to action. The aesthetic plausibility of an idea depends\nlargely upon its initial plausibility with the artist. There is nothing\nmore contagious than belief. To utter things with an accent of\nconviction is half the battle in getting oneself believed. If the\nartist pretends to believe something and expresses himself with an air\nof assurance, we accept it, no matter how preposterous it may be from\nthe practical or scientific point of view. Think of Rabelais!",
        "A work of art is a logical system. It presupposes certain assumptions,\npostulates, conventions, which we must accept if we are to live in its\nworld. Now, in order that we may accept them, the artist must first\nhave vividly accepted them himself. Only if they have become a very\npart of him, can they become at all valid for us. The failure of\nclassicistic art in a non-classical age, of “Pre-Raphaelitism” after\nRaphael, is a failure in this–the artist has never lived even\nimaginatively in the world he depicts. His belief is an artifice and\na sham, and he cannot impose upon us with his pretense. But once we\nhave accepted the artist’s postulates, then we are prepared to follow\nhim in his conclusions. In the Homeric world, we shall not balk at the\nintercourse between gods and men; in mediaeval painting and drama, we\nshall accept miracle; in Alice in Wonderland, we shall accept\nany dream-like enchantment. But we demand that the conclusions shall\nfollow from the premises, that the whole be consistent. We cannot\ntolerate miracle in a realistic novel or drama, or glaring inaccuracy\nof fact in a historical novel, because they are in contradiction to\nthe laws of reality tacitly assumed. The final demand which we make\nof any work, of art is that it live. What can be made to live for us\nmay be beautiful to us. But nothing can draw our life into itself which\nhas not drawn the artist’s, or which is untrue to its own inner logic.",
        "One of the most life-creating elements of a work of art is imagery.\nEverywhere in art the tendency exists for ideas to be filled out,\nrendered concrete and vivid, through images. In looking at a painting\nof a summer landscape, for example, we not only recognize the colors\nas meaning sunlight, but actually experience them as warm; in looking\nat a statue we not only recognize its surface as that of the body of\na woman, but we feel its softness and smoothness; which involves that\nthe ideas of sunlight and a human body, employed in interpreting the\nsensations received from these works of art, are developed back into\nthe original mass of images from which they were derived. However,\nalthough ideas are formed from images, they are not images,–as our\nordinary employment of them in recognizing objects attests. We may and\nusually do, for example, recognize a mirror as smooth without\nexperiencing it as smooth–the image equivalent of the idea remains\nlatent. Our ordinary experience with objects is too hasty and too\nintent on practical ends for images to develop. On the other hand, the\nleisurely attitude characteristic of the aesthetic experience is\nfavorable to the recall of images; hence, just as in the aesthetic\nperception of objects we put our feelings into them, so equally we\nimport into them the relevant images. The aesthetic reaction tends to\nbe total. Our demand for feeling in art also requires the image; for\nfeelings are more vividly attached to images than to abstract ideas.\nIt is a fact familiar in the experience of everybody that the strength\nof the emotional tone of an object is a function of the clearness of\nthe image which we form of it on recall. We can preserve the feeling\ntone of a past event or an absent object only if we can keep a vivid\nimage of it; as our image of it becomes vague, our interest in it\ndissipates. Everywhere in our experience the image mediates between\nfeeling and idea. So in art. Images have no more an independent and\nself-sufficient status in art than sensations have; like the latter\nthey are a means for the expression of feeling. In the painting of\nsunlight, for example, the images of warmth carry joyousness and a\nsense of ease; in the statue, the tactile images convey the emotional\nresponse to the represented object. In literature the expressiveness\nof images is perhaps even more impressive. Consider how longing is\naroused by the tactile, gustatory, and thermal images in the oft-quoted\nlines of Keats:–",
        "  O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been\n  Cool’d a long age in the deep-delved earth.",
        "Examples might be multiplied indefinitely.",
        "In literature alone of the arts, images from all departments of sense\ncan be aroused. Visual images play a greater role there than in painting\nand sculpture, for the reason that, in the latter, visual sensations\ntake their place–we do not image what we can see. In sculpture, the\ngreater part of the imagery is of touch and motion–in the imagination,\nwe feel the surfaces and move with the represented motions; the\nwhiteness or blackness of the materials prevents the arousal of the\nimage of the color of the body. In painting, besides the temperature\nimages already mentioned, there are touch images–in still-life, for\nexample, when silks and furs are represented; images of odors, in\nflower pieces; of motion, in pictures which depict motion, as in the\nracing horses of Degas; of taste, in pictures of wine and fruit. Of\ncourse the kind and amount of imagery depend upon the imaginal type\nto which the spectator belongs and the wealth of the imaginal furnishing\nof his mind. In any art, moreover, the chief and requisite thing is\nexpression through the sense medium, which should never be obscured\nby expression through associated images. It is not the primary business\nof a flower painter to arouse images of perfume, but to compose colors\nand lines; nor the function of the musician to arouse the visual images\nwhich accompany the musical experience of many people, but to compose\nsounds. In sculpture, on the other hand, images of touch and movement\nplay an almost necessary part, for they are constituent elements in\nthe representation of form and motion; yet it is not indispensable to\nthe appreciation of sculpture that images of the sweet odor of the\nhuman body be awakened. The image is seldom the basis of aesthetic\nappreciation; it is more often its completion. But we shall go into\nthese matters more in detail in our special chapters.",
        "In the representative arts, particularly painting and sculpture, the\nassociated images are fused with the visual sensations which constitute\nthe medium. I see the softness and sweet-odorousness of the painted\nrose petal, just as I see the real rose soft and sweet; I see the\nsurface of the statue firm and shapely, just as I see the human body\nso. This is because the ideas of the things represented in painting\nand sculpture seem to be actually present in the visual sensations\nwhich they interpret; the flower and the man seem to be there before\nme. In these arts, aesthetic perception is a fusion of image with\nsensation in much the way that normal perception is. In literature and\nmusic, on the other hand, the connection between the sense medium of\nthe art and the associated images is less close; and for the reason\nthat the sounds are no part of the things which they bring before the\nmind. In looking at a picture of a rose, I see the red as an element\nof the rose represented; whereas, in reading about a rose, I only seem\nto hear a voice describing it. In the latter case, therefore, the\nolfactory and visual images have a certain remoteness and independence\nof the word-sounds; I do not actually see and smell them in the sounds.\nHowever, in the case of familiar words with a strong emotional\nsignificance, the fusion of image with sound may be almost complete.\nWho, for example, does not see a sweet and red image of a rose into\nthe word-sounds when he reads:–",
        "  Oh, my love’s like a red, red rose\n  That’s newly sprung in June.",
        "Or, when Dante describes the selva oscura, who does not see the\ndarkness in the word oscura? In all such cases a strong feeling\ntone binds together the word-sound with the image. This fusion is most\nstriking in poetry because of the highly emotional material with which\nit works.",
        "The ideas and images associated with a work of art depend very largely\non the education, experience, and idiosyncrasy of the spectator. The\nscholar, for example, will put tenfold more meaning into his reading\nof the Divine Comedy than the untrained person. Or compare Pater’s\ninterpretation of the “Mona Lisa” with Muther’s. Can we say that certain\nideas and images belong properly to the work of art, while others do\nnot? With regard to this, we can, I think, set up two criteria. First,\nthe intention of the artist–whatever the artist meant his work to\nexpress: that it expresses. Yet, since this can never be certainly and\ncompletely discovered, there must always remain a large region of\nundetermined interpretation. Now for judging the relevancy of this\npenumbra of meaning and association the following test applies–does it\nbring us back to the sensuous medium of the work of art or lead us away?\nAnything is legitimate which we actually put into the form of the work\nof art and keep there, while whatever merely hangs loose around it is\nillegitimate. For example, if while listening to music we give ourselves\nup to personal memories and fancies, we are almost sure to neglect the\nsounds and their structure; we cannot objectify the former in the\nlatter; with the result that the composition is largely lost to us.\nNaturally, no hard and fast lines can be drawn, especially in the case\nof works of vague import like music; yet we can use this criterion as a\nprinciple for regulating and inhibiting our associations. It demands of\nus a wide-awake and receptive appreciation. The genuine meanings and\nassociations of a work of art are those which are the irresistible and\nnecessary results of the sense stimuli working upon an attentive\npercipient; the rest are not only arbitrary, but injurious.",
        "To this, some people would doubtless object on the ground that art was\nmade for man and not man for art. The work of art, they would claim,\nshould interpret the personal experience of the spectator; hence\nwhatever he puts into it belongs there of right. There are, however,\ntwo considerations limiting the validity of this assertion. First, the\nwork of art is primarily an expression of the artist’s personality\nand, second, its purpose is to provide a common medium of expression\nfor the experience of all men. If interpretation remains a purely\nindividual affair, both its relation to the artist and the possibility\nof a common aesthetic experience through it are destroyed. For this\nreason we should, I believe, deliberately seek to make our appreciations\nhistorically sound and definite. And in the social and historical\nappreciation resulting, we shall find our own lives–not so different\nfrom the artist’s and our fellows’–abundantly and sufficiently\nexpressed.",
