Two or three such moments it has been my good fortune\nto enjoy with you, in talking over the mysteries which forever\nfascinate while they forever baffle us. It was our midnight talks\nin Great Russell Street and the Addison Road, and our bright May\nholiday on the Thames, that led me to write this scanty essay on\nthe “Unseen World,” and to whom could I so heartily dedicate it\nas to you? I only wish it were more worthy of its origin. As for\nthe dozen papers which I have appended to it, by way of clearing\nout my workshop, I hope you will read them indulgently, and\nbelieve\nme",
