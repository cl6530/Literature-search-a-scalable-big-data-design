        "The Indians did not disperse after the ceremonies of the surrender had\nbeen gone through. They continued still in the vicinity of the Portage,\nin the constant expectation of the arrival of the annuity money, which\nthey had been summoned there to receive. But the time for setting out\non his journey to bring it was postponed by Governor Porter from week to\nweek. Had he foreseen all the evils this delay was to occasion, he\nwould, possibly, have been more prompt in fulfilling his appointment.",
        "Many causes conspired to make an early payment desirable. In the first\nplace, the Winnebagoes, having been driven from their homes by their\nanxiety to avoid all appearance of fraternizing with the Sauks, had made\nthis year no gardens nor corn-fields They had, therefore, no provisions\non hand, either for present use or for their winter’s consumption,\nexcept their scanty supplies of wild rice. While this was disappearing\nduring their protracted detention at the Portage, they were running the\nrisk of leaving themselves quite unprovided with food, in case of a bad\nhunting-season during the winter and spring.",
        "In the next place, the rations which the Agent had been accustomed, by\nthe permission of Government, to deal out occasionally to them, were now\ncut off by a scarcity in the Commissary’s department. The frequent\nlevies of the militia during the summer campaign, and the reinforcement\nof the garrison by the troops from Port Howard, had drawn so largely on\nthe stores at this post that there was necessity for the most rigid\neconomy in the issuing of supplies.",
        "Foreseeing this state of things, Mr. Kinzie, as soon as the war was at\nan end, commissioned Mr. Kercheval, then sutler at Fort Howard, to\nprocure him a couple of boat-loads of corn, to be distributed among the\nIndians. Unfortunately, there was no corn to be obtained from Michigan;\nit was necessary to bring it from Ohio, and by the time it at length\nreached Green Bay (for in those days business was never done in a hurry)\nthe navigation of the Fox River had closed, and it was detained there,\nto be brought up the following spring.",
        "As day after day wore on and “the silver” did not make its appearance,\nthe Indians were advised by their Father to disperse to their\nhunting-grounds to procure food, with the promise that they should be\nsummoned immediately on the arrival of Governor Porter; and this advice\nthey followed.",
        "While they had been in our neighborhood, they had more than once asked\npermission to dance the scalp-dance, before our door. This is the most\nfrightful, heart-curdling exhibition that can possibly be imagined. The\nscalps are stretched on little hoops, or frames, and carried on the end\nof slender poles. These are brandished about in the course of the dance,\nwith cries, shouts, and furious gestures. The women, who commence as\nspectators, becoming excited with the scene and the music which their\nown discordant notes help to make more deafening, rush in, seize the\nscalps from the hands of the owners, and toss them frantically about,\nwith the screams and yells of demons. I have seen as many as forty or\nfifty scalps figuring in one dance. Upon one occasion one was borne by\nan Indian who approached quite near me, and I shuddered as I observed\nthe long, fair hair, evidently that of a woman. Another Indian had the\nskin of a human hand, stretched and prepared with as much care as if it\nhad been some costly jewel. When these dances occurred, as they\nsometimes did, by moonlight, they were peculiarly horrid and revolting.",
        "Amid so many events of a painful character there were not wanting\noccasionally some that bordered on the ludicrous.",
        "One evening, while sitting at tea, we were alarmed by the sound of guns\nfiring in the direction of the Wisconsin. All started up, and prepared,\ninstinctively, for flight to the garrison. As we left the house we found\nthe whole bluff and the meadow below in commotion,–Indians running with\ntheir guns and spears across their shoulders to the scene of\nalarm–squaws and children standing in front of their lodges and looking\nanxiously in the direction of the unusual and unaccountable\nsounds–groups of French and half-breeds, like ourselves, fleeing to\ngain the bridge and place themselves within the pickets so lately\nerected.",
        "As one company of Indians passed us hurriedly, some weapon carelessly\ncarried hit one of our party on the side of the head. “Oh!” shrieked\nshe, “I am killed! an Indian has tomahawked me!” and she was only\nreassured by finding she could still run as fast as the best of us.",
        "When we reached the parade-ground, within the Fort, we could not help\nlaughing at the grotesque appearance we presented. Some without hats or\nshawls–others with packages of valuables hastily secured at the\nmoment–one with her piece of bread-and-butter in hand, which she had\nnot had the presence of mind to lay aside when she took to flight.",
        "The alarm was, in the end, found to have proceeded from a party of\nWinnebagoes from one of the Barribault villages, who, being about to\nleave their home for a period, were going through the ceremony of\nburying the scalps which they and their fathers had taken.",
        "Like the military funerals among civilized nations, their solemnities\nwere closed on this occasion by the discharge of several volleys over\nthe grave of their trophies.",
        "At length, about the beginning of November, two months after the time\nappointed, Governor Porter, accompanied by Major Forsyth and Mr.\nKercheval, arrived with the annuity money. The Indians were again\nassembled, the payment was made, and having supplied themselves with a\nlarger quantity of ammunition than usual,–for they saw the necessity of\na good hunt to remedy past and present deficiencies,–they set off for\ntheir wintering grounds.",
        "We were, ourselves, about changing our quarters, to our no small\nsatisfaction. Notwithstanding the Indian disturbances, the new Agency\nHouse (permission to build which had, after much delay, been accorded by\nGovernment) had been going steadily on, and soon after the departure of\nthe Governor and his party, we took possession of it.",
        "We had been settled but a few weeks, when one morning Lieutenant Davies\nappeared just as we were sitting down to breakfast, with a face full of\nconsternation. ’The Indian prisoners had escaped from the black-hole!\nThe commanding officer, Colonel Cutler, had sent for Mr. Kinzie to come\nover to the Fort and counsel with him what was to be done.”",
        "The prisoners had probably commenced their operations very soon after\nbeing placed in the black-hole, a dungeon in the basement of the\nguard-house. They observed that their meals were brought regularly,\nthree times a day, and that in the intervals they were left entirely to\nthemselves. With their knives they commenced excavating an opening, the\nearth from which, as it was withdrawn, they spread about on the floor of\ntheir prison. A blanket was placed over the hole, and one of the company\nwas always seated upon it, before the regular time for the soldier who\nhad charge of them to make his appearance. When the periodical visit was\nmade, the Indians were always observed to be seated, smoking in the most\norderly and quiet manner. There was never anything in their appearance\nto excite suspicion.",
        "The prisoners had never read the memoirs of Baron Trenck, but they had\nwatched the proceedings of the badgers; so, profiting by their example,\nthey worked on, shaping the opening spirally, until, in about six weeks,\nthey came out to the open air beyond the walls of the Fort.",
        "That they might be as little encumbered as possible in their flight,\nthey left their blankets behind them, and although it was bitter\nDecember weather, they took to the woods and prairies with only their\ncalico shirts and leggings for covering. We can readily believe that\nhope and exultation kept them comfortably warm until they reached an\nasylum among their friends.",
        "It would be compromising our own reputation as loyal and patriotic\ncitizens to tell of the secret rejoicing this news occasioned us.",
        "The question now was, how to get the fugitives back again. The Agent\ncould promise no more than that he would communicate with the chiefs,\nand represent the wishes of the officers that the prisoners should once\nmore surrender themselves, and thus free those who had had the charge of\nthem from the imputation of carelessness, which the Government would be\nvery likely to throw upon them.",
        "When, according to their custom, many of the chiefs assembled at the\nAgency on New-Year’s Day, their Father laid the subject before them.",
        "The Indians replied, that if they saw the young men they would tell\nthem what the officers would like to have them do. They could,\nthemselves, do nothing in the matter. They had fulfilled their\nengagement by bringing them once and putting them in the hands of the\nofficers. The Government had had them in its power once and could not\nkeep them–it must now go and catch them itself.",
        "The Government, having had some experience the past summer in “catching\nIndians,” wisely concluded to drop the matter.",
        "About this time another event occurred which occasioned no small\nexcitement in our little community. Robineau, the striker from the\nblacksmith establishment at Sugar Creek, near the Four Lakes, arrived\none very cold day at the Agency. He had come to procure medical aid for\nMâtâ’s eldest daughter, Sophy, who, while sliding on the lake, had\nfallen on the ice and been badly hurt. Her father was absent, having\ngone to Prairie du Chien to place his youngest daughter at school. Two\nor three days had elapsed since the accident had happened; a high fever\nhad set in, and the poor girl was in a state of great suffering; it had\ntherefore been thought best to send Robineau to us for advice and aid,\nleaving Turcotte and a friendly Indian woman from a neighboring lodge to\ntake charge of poor Sophy.",
        "The commanding officer did not think it prudent, when the subject was\nlaid before him, to permit the surgeon to leave the post, but he very\ncheerfully granted leave of absence to Currie, the hospital steward, a\nyoung man who possessed some knowledge of medicine and surgery.",
        "As it was important that Sophy should have an experienced nurse, we\nprocured the services of Madame Bellaire, the wife of the Frenchman who\nwas generally employed as express to Chicago; and, as an aid and\ncompanion, Agathe, a daughter of Day-kau-ray, who lived in Paquette’s\nfamily, was added to the party.",
        "Of Agathe I shall have more to say hereafter.",
        "The weather was excessively cold when Robineau, Currie, and the two\nwomen set out for Sugar Creek, a distance of about forty miles. We had\nprovided them with a good store of rice, crackers, tea, and sugar, for\nthe invalid, all of which, with their provisions for the way, were\npacked on the horse Robineau had ridden to the Portage. It was expected\nthey would reach their place of destination on the second day.",
        "What, then, was our surprise to see Turcotte make his appearance on the\nfourth day after their departure, to inquire why Robineau had not\nreturned with aid for poor Sophy! There was but one solution of the\nmystery. Robineau had guided them as ill as he had guided the boat at\nthe Grande Chûte the summer before, and, although he could not shipwreck\nthem, he had undoubtedly lost them in the woods or prairies. One comfort\nwas, that they could not well starve, for the rice and crackers would\nfurnish them with several days’ provisions, and with Agathe, who must be\naccustomed to this kind of life, they could not fail in time of finding\nIndians, and being brought back to the Portage.",
        "Still, day after day went on and we received no tidings of them.\nTurcotte returned to Sugar Creek with comforts and prescriptions for\nSophy, and Colonel Cutler sent out a party to hunt for the missing ones,\namong whom poor Currie, from his delicate constitution, was the object\nof our greatest commiseration.",
        "As the snow fell and the winds howled, we could employ ourselves about\nnothing but walking from window to window, watching, in hopes of seeing\nsome one appear in the distance. No Indians were at hand whom we could\ndispatch upon the search, and by the tenth day we had almost given up in\ndespair.",
        "It was then that the joyful news was suddenly brought us, “They are\nfound! They are at the Fort!” A party of soldiers who had been exploring\nhad encountered them at Hastings’s Woods, twelve miles distant, slowly\nand feebly making their way back to the Portage. They knew they were on\nthe right track, but had hardly strength to pursue it.",
        "Exhausted with cold and hunger, for their provisions had given out two\ndays before, they had thought seriously of killing the horse and eating\nhim. Nothing but Currie’s inability to proceed on foot, and the dread of\nbeing compelled to leave him in the woods to perish, had deterred them.",
        "Agathe had from the first been convinced that they were on the wrong\ntrack, but Robineau, with his usual obstinacy, persevered in keeping it\nuntil it brought them to the Rock River, when he was obliged to\nacknowledge his error, and they commenced retracing their steps.",
        "Agathe, according to the custom of her people, had carried her hatchet\nwith her, and thus they had always had a fire at night, and boughs to\nshelter them from the storms; otherwise they must inevitably have\nperished.",
        "There were two circumstances which aroused in us a stronger feeling even\nthan that of sympathy. The first was, the miserable Robineau’s having\ndemanded of Currie, first, all his money, and afterwards his watch, as a\ncondition of his bringing the party back into the right path, which he\naverred he knew perfectly well.",
        "The second was, Bellaire’s giving his kind, excellent wife a hearty\nflogging “for going off,” as he said, “on such a fool’s errand.”",
        "The latter culprit was out of our jurisdiction, but Mons. Robineau was\ndischarged on the spot, and warned that he might think himself happy to\nescape a legal process for swindling.",
        "I am happy to say that Sophy Mâtâ, in whose behalf all these sufferings\nhad been endured, was quite recovered by the time her father returned\nfrom the Prairie.",
