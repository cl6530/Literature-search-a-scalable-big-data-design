        "First of all, condemn the life thou art now leading: but\nwhen thou hast condemned it, do not despair of thyself—be not\nlike them of mean spirit, who once they have yielded, abandon\nthemselves entirely and as it were allow the torrent to sweep\nthem away. No; learn what the wrestling masters do. Has the boy\nfallen? “Rise,” they say, “wrestle again, till thy strength come\nto thee.” Even thus should it be with thee. For know that there\nis nothing more tractable than the human soul. It needs but to\nwill, and the thing is done; the soul is set upon the right path:\nas on the contrary it needs but to nod over the task, and all is\nlost. For ruin and recovery alike are from within.",
