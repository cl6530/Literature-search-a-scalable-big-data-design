        "When that now the strangers / all from thence were gone,\nSpake unto his followers / noble Siegmund’s son:\n“We shall eke make ready / home to my land to fare.\"\nUnto his spouse was welcome / such news when she the same did hear.",
        "691",
        "She spake unto her husband: / “When shall we hence depart?\nNot hastily on the journey / I pray thee yet to start.\nWith me first my brothers / their wide lands shall share.\"\nSiegfried yet it pleased not / such words from Kriemhild to hear.",
        "692",
        "The princes went unto him / and spake they there all three:\n“Now know thou well, Sir Siegfried, / for thee shall ever be\nIn faithfulness our service / ready while yet we live.\"\nThe royal thanes then thanked he / who thus did proof of friendship give.",
        "693",
        "“With thee further share we,\" / spake young Giselher,\n“The lands and eke the castles / by us that owned are.\nIn wide lands whatsoever / we rule o’er warriors brave,\nOf the same with Kriemhild / a goodly portion shalt thou have.",
        "694",
        "Then spake unto the princes / the son of Siegmund\nWhen he their lofty purpose / did rightly understand:\n“God grant your goodly heritage / at peace may ever be,\nAnd eke therein your people. / The spouse in sooth so dear to me.”",
        "695",
        "“May well forego the portion / that ye to her would give.\nFor she a crown shall carry, / if to such day I live,\nAnd queen more rich than any / that lives she then must be.\nWhat else to her ye offer, / therein I’ll meet you faithfully.”",
        "696",
        "Then spake the Lady Kriemhild: / “If wealth thou wilt not choose,\nYet gallant thanes of Burgundy / shalt thou not light refuse.\nThey’re such as monarch gladly / would lead to his own land.\nOf these shall make division / with me my loving brothers’ hand.”",
        "697",
        "Thereto spake noble Gernot: / “Now take to please thy mind.\nWho gladly will go with thee / full many here thou’lt find.\nOf thirty hundred warriors / we give thee thousand men\nTo be thy royal escort.\" / Kriemhild did summon then",
        "698",
        "Hagen of Tronje to her / and Ortwein instantly:\nAnd would they and their kinsmen / make her good company?\nTo hear the same did Hagen / begin to rage full sore.\nQuoth he: “E’en royal Gunther / may thus bestow us nevermore.",
        "699",
        "“Other men that serve thee, / let them follow thee;\nThou know’st the men of Tronje / and what their pledges be:\nHere must we by the monarchs / in service true abide;\nHereto as them we followed, / so shall we henceforth keep their side.”",
        "700",
        "And so the thing was ended: / to part they ready make.\nA high and noble escort / did Kriemhild to her take,\nMaidens two and thirty / and five hundred men also.\nIn Lady Kriemhild’s company / the Margrave Eckewart did go.",
        "701",
        "Leave took they all together, / squire and also knight,\nMaidens and fair ladies, / as was their wont aright.\nThere parted they with kisses / and eke with clasp of hand:\nRight merrily they journeyed / forth from royal Gunther’s land.",
        "702",
        "Their friends did give them escort / upon the way full far.\nNight-quarters at every station / they bade for them prepare,\nWhere they might wish to tarry / as on their way they went.\nThen straightway was a messenger / unto royal Siegmund sent,",
        "703",
        "To him and Siegelind bearing / thereof the joyful sign\nThat his son was coming / from Worms upon the Rhine\nAnd with him Ute’s daughter, / Kriemhild the fair lady.\nAs this could other message / nevermore so welcome be.",
        "704",
        "“Well is me!” quoth Siegmund, / “that I the day have known,\nWhen the fair Lady Kriemhild / here shall wear a crown.\nThus higher shall my kingdom / stand in majesty.\nMy son the noble Siegfried / here himself the king shall be.”",
        "705",
        "Then dealt the Lady Siegelind / velvet red in store,\nSilver and gold full heavy / to them the news that bore:\nShe joyed to hear the story / that there her ear did greet.\nThen decked themselves her ladies / all in rich attire meet.",
        "706",
        "’Twas told, with Siegfried coming / whom they did expect.\nThen bade they sitting-places / straightway to erect,\nWhere he before his kinsmen / a crown in state should wear.\nThen men of royal Siegmund / forward rode to meet him there.",
        "707",
        "Was e’er more royal greeting, / news have I not to hand,\nAs came the knights full noble / into Siegmund’s land.\nThere the royal Siegelind / to Kriemhild forth did ride\nWith ladies fair a many, / and followed gallant knights beside",
        "708",
        "Out a full day’s journey / to welcome each high guest.\nAnd little with the strangers / did they ever rest\nUntil into a castle / wide they came once more,\nThe same was called Xanten, / where anon a crown they wore.",
        "709",
        "With smiling lips Dame Siegelind / –and Siegmund eke did this–\nTo show the love they bore her / full oft did Kriemhild kiss,\nAnd eke the royal Siegfried: / far was their sorrow gone.\nAnd all the merry company, / good welcome had they every one.",
        "710",
        "The train of strangers bade they / ’fore Siegmund’s Hall to lead,\nAnd maidens fair a many / down from gallant steed\nHelped they there dismounting. / Full many a man was there\nTo do them willing service / as was meet for ladies fair.",
        "711",
        "How great soe’er the splendor / erstwhile beside the Rhine,\nHere none the less was given / raiment yet more fine,\nNor were they e’er attired / in all their days so well.\nFull many a wonder might I / of their rich apparel tell.",
        "712",
        "How there in state resplendent / they sat and had full store,\nAnd how each high attendant / gold-broidered raiment wore,\nWith stones full rare and precious / set with skill therein!\nThe while with care did serve them / Siegelind the noble queen.",
        "713",
        "Then spake the royal Siegmund / before his people so:\n“To every friend of Siegfried / give I now to know\nThat he before these warriors / my royal crown shall wear.\"\nAnd did rejoice that message / the thanes of Netherland to hear.",
        "714",
        "His crown to him he tendered / and rule o’er wide domain\nWhereof he all was master. / Where’er did reach his reign\nOr men were subject to him / bestowed his hand such care\nThat evil-doers trembled / before the spouse of Kriemhild fair.",
        "715",
        "In such high honor truly / he lived, as ye shall hear,\nAnd judged as lofty monarch / unto the tenth year,\nWhat time his fairest lady / to him a son did bear.\nThereat the monarch’s kinsmen / filled with mickle joyance were.",
        "716",
        "They soon the same did christen / and gave to him a name,\nGunther, as hight his uncle, / nor cause was that for shame:\nGrew he but like his kinsmen / then happy might he be.\nAs well he did deserve it, / him fostered they right carefully.",
        "717",
        "In the selfsame season / did Lady Siegelind die,\nWhen was full power wielded / by Ute’s daughter high,\nAs meet so lofty lady / should homage wide receive.\nThat death her thus had taken / did many a worthy kinsman grieve.",
        "718",
        "Now by the Rhine yonder, / as we likewise hear,\nUnto mighty Gunther / eke a son did bear\nBrunhild his fair lady / in the land of Burgundy.\nIn honor to the hero / Siegfried named eke was he.",
        "719",
        "The child they also fostered / with what tender care!\nGunther the noble monarch / anon did masters rare\nFind who should instruct him / a worthy man to grow.\nAlas! by sad misfortune / to friends was dealt how fell a blow!",
        "720",
        "At all times the story / far abroad was told,\nHow that in right worthy / way the warriors bold\nLived there in Siegmund’s country / as noble knights should do.\nLikewise did royal Gunther / eke amid his kinsmen true.",
        "721",
        "Land of the Nibelungen / Siegfried as well did own,\n–Amid his lofty kindred / a mightier ne’er was known–\nAnd Schilbung’s knights did serve him, / with all that theirs had been.\nThat great was thus his power / did fill with joy the knight full keen.",
        "722",
        "Hoard of all the greatest / that hero ever won,\nSave who erstwhile did wield it, / now the knight did own,\nThe which before a mountain / he seized against despite,\nAnd for whose sake he further / slew full many a gallant knight.",
        "723",
        "Naught more his heart could wish for; / yet had his might been less,\nRightly must all people / of the high knight confess,\nOne was he of the worthiest / that e’er bestrode a steed.\nFeared was his mickle prowess, / and, sooth to say, thereof was need.",
